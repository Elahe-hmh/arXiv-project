Here\nwe study this equation with spatially-varying sources and stirring, or\nadvection. We specialize to symmetric mixtures and time-independent sources and\ndiscuss stirring strategies that homogenize the binary fluid. By measuring\nfluctuations of the composition away from its mean value, we quantify the\namount of homogenization achievable. We find upper and lower bounds on our\nmeasure of homogenization using only the Cahn-Hilliard equation and the\nincompressibility of the advecting flow. We compare these theoretical bounds\nwith numerical simulations for two model flows: the constant flow, and the\nrandom-phase sine flow. Using the sine flow as an example, we show how our\nbounds on composition fluctuations provide a measure of the effectiveness of a\ngiven stirring protocol in homogenizing a phase-separating binary fluid.\n", "  We investigate the recent suggestion that a Minkowski vacuum is either\nabsolutely stable, or it has a divergent decay rate and thus fails to have a\nlocally Minkowski description. The divergence comes from boost integration over\nmomenta of the vacuum bubbles. We point out that a prototypical example of\nfalse-vacuum decay is pair production in a uniform electric field, so if the\nargument leading to the divergence is correct, it should apply to this case as\nwell. We provide evidence that no catastrophic vacuum instability occurs in a\nconstant electric field, indicating that the argument cannot be right. Instead,\nwe argue that the boost integration that leads to the divergence is\nunnecessary: when all possible fluctuations of the vacuum bubble are included,\nthe quantum state of the bubble is invariant under Lorentz boosts.\n", "  From pure Yang-Mills action for the $SL(5,\\mathbb{R})$ group in four\nEuclidean dimensions we obtain a gravity theory in the first order formalism.\nBesides the Einstein-Hilbert term, the effective gravity has a cosmological\nconstant term, a curvature squared term, a torsion squared term and a matter\nsector. To obtain such geometrodynamical theory, asymptotic freedom and the\nGribov parameter (soft BRST symmetry breaking) are crucial. Particularly,\nNewton and cosmological constant are related to these parameters and they also\nrun as functions of the energy scale. One-loop computations are performed and\nthe results are interpreted.\n", "  In this paper we provide a general account of the causal models which attempt\nto provide a solution to the famous measurement problem of Quantum Mechanics\n(QM). We will argue that --leaving aside instrumentalism which restricts the\nphysical meaning of QM to the algorithmic prediction of measurement outcomes--\nthe many interpretations which can be found in the literature can be\ndistinguished through the way they model the measurement process, either in\nterms of the efficient cause or in terms of the final cause. We will discuss\nand analyze why both, 'final cause' and 'efficient cause' models, face severe\ndifficulties to solve the measurement problem. In contradistinction to these\nschemes we will present a new model based on the immanent cause which, we will\nargue, provides an intuitive understanding of the measurement process in QM.\n", "  We propose to detect quadrupole interactions of neutral ultra-cold atoms via\ntheir induced mean-field shift. We consider a Mott insulator state of\nspin-polarized atoms in a two-dimensional optical square lattice. The\nquadrupole moments of the atoms are aligned by an external magnetic field. As\nthe alignment angle is varied, the mean-field shift shows a characteristic\nangular dependence, which constitutes the defining signature of the quadrupole\ninteraction. For the $^{3}P_{2}$ states of Yb and Sr atoms, we find a frequency\nshift of the order of tens of Hertz, which can be realistically detected in\nexperiment with current technology. We compare our results to the mean-field\nshift of a spin-polarized quasi-2D Fermi gas in continuum.\n", "  We demonstrate a low-noise frequency down-conversion of photons at 637 nm to\nthe telecommunication band at 1587 nm by the difference frequency generation in\na periodically-poled lithium niobate. An internal conversion efficiency of the\nconverter is estimated to be 0.44 at the maximum which is achieved by a pump\npower of 430 mW, whereas a rate of internal background photons caused by the\nstrong cw pump laser is estimated to be 9 kHz/mW within a bandwidth of about 1\nnm. By using the experimental values related to the intrinsic property of the\nconverter, and using the intensity correlation and the average photon number of\na 637-nm input light pulse, we derive the intensity correlation of a converted\ntelecom light pulse. Then we discuss feasibility of a single-photon frequency\nconversion to the telecommunication band for a long-distance quantum\ncommunication based on NV centers in diamond.\n", "  An analytical theory of high voltage reverse-biased p+-n-n+-structures\npicosecond switching into conducting state by pulsed lighting has been\ndeveloped and a numerical simulation of this process has been performed.\nCombining the results of theory and simulation allowed us to obtain a simple\nrelation between the parameters of structure, light pulse, external circuit and\nmain characteristics of the process - the load current pulse amplitude and\nduration of switching process.\n", "  The experiments of Leptos et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 198103 (2009)] show\nthat the displacements of small particles affected by swimming microorganisms\nachieve a non-Gaussian distribution, which nevertheless scales diffusively --\nthe 'diffusive scaling.' We use a simple model where the particles undergo\nrepeated 'kicks' due to the swimmers to explain the shape of the distribution\nas a function of the volume fraction of swimmers. The net displacement is\ndetermined by the inverse Fourier transform of a single-swimmer characteristic\nfunction. The only adjustable parameter is the strength of the stresslet term\nin our spherical squirmer model. We give a criterion for convergence to a\nGaussian distribution in terms of moments of the drift function, and show that\nthe experimentally-observed diffusive scaling is a transient related to the\nslow crossover of the fourth moment from a ballistic to a linear regime with\npath length. We also present a simple model, with logarithmic drift\nfunction,that can be solved analytically.\n", "  Recent experiments and numerical simulations have shown that certain types of\nmicroorganisms \"reflect\" off of a flat surface at a critical angle of\ndeparture, independent of the angle of incidence. The nature of the reflection\nmay be active (cell and flagellar contact with the surface) or passive\n(hydrodynamic) interactions. We explore the billiard-like motion of a body with\nthis empirical reflection law inside a regular polygon and show that the\ndynamics can settle on a stable periodic orbit or can be chaotic, depending on\nthe swimmer's departure angle and the domain geometry. The dynamics are often\nfound to be robust to the introduction of weak random fluctuations. The\nLyapunov exponent of swimmer trajectories can be positive or negative, can have\nextremal values, and can have discontinuities depending on the degree of the\npolygon. A passive sorting device is proposed that traps swimmers of different\ndeparture angles into separate bins. We also study the external problem of a\nmicroorganism swimming in a patterned environment of square obstacles, where\nthe departure angle dictates the possibility of trapping or diffusive\ntrajectories.\n", "  It is shown that tiling in icosahedral quasicrystals can also be properly\ndescribed by cyclic twinning at the unit cell level. The twinning operation is\napplied on the primitive prolate golden rhombohedra, which can be considered a\nresult of a distorted face-centered cubic parent structure. The shape of the\nrhombohedra is determined by an exact space filling, resembling the forbidden\nfive-fold rotational symmetry. Stacking of clusters, formed around multiply\ntwinned rhombic hexecontahedra, keeps the rhombohedra of adjacent clusters in\ndiscrete relationships. Thus periodicities, interrelated as members of a\nFibonacci series, are formed. The intergrown twins form no obvious twin\nboundaries and fill the space in combination with the oblate golden\nrhombohedra, formed between clusters in contact. Simulated diffraction patterns\nof the multiply twinned rhombohedra and the Fourier transform of an extended\nmodel structure are in full accord with the experimental diffraction patterns\nand can be indexed by means of three-dimensional crystallography.\n", "  The paper contains an extensive study of the unified first law (UFL) in the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime model. By projecting the UFL along the\nKodama vector the second Friedmann equation can be obtained. Also studying the\nUFL on the event horizon it is found that Clausius relation cannot be obtained\nfrom the UFL by projecting it along the tangent to the event horizon as it can\nbe for the trapping horizon. However, it is shown in the present work that\nClausius relation can be obtained by projecting the UFL along the Kodama vector\non the horizon and the result is found to be true for any horizon. Finally\nmotivated by the Unruh temperature for the Rindler observer, surface gravity is\nredefined and a Clausius relation is obtained from the UFL by projecting it\nalong a vector analogous to the Kodama vector.\n", "  We describe min-max formulas for the principal eigenvalue of a $V$-drift\nLaplacian defined by a vector field $V$ on a geodesic ball of a Riemannian\nmanifold $N$. Then we derive comparison results for the principal eigenvalue\nwith the one of a spherically symmetric model space endowed with a radial\nvector field, under pointwise comparison of the corresponding radial sectional\nand Ricci curvatures, and of the radial component of the vector fields. These\nresults generalize the known case $V=0$.\n", "  Decoherence is an essential mechanism that defines the boundary between\nclassical and quantum behaviours, while imposing technological bounds for\nquantum devices. Little is known about quantum coherence of mechanical systems,\nas opposed to electromagnetic degrees of freedom. But decoherence can also be\nthought of in a purely classical context, as the loss of phase coherence in the\nclassical phase space. Indeed the bridge between quantum and classical physics\nis under intense investigation, using in particular classical nanomechanical\nanalogues of quantum phenomena. In the present work, by separating pure\ndephasing from dissipation, we quantitatively model the classical decoherence\nof a mechanical resonator: through the experimental control of frequency\nfluctuations, we engineer artificial dephasing. Building on the fruitful\nanalogy introduced between spins/quantum bits and nanomechanical modes, we\nreport on the methods available to define pure dephasing in these systems,\nwhile demonstrating the intrinsic almost-ideal properties of silicon-nitride\nbeams. These experimental and theoretical results, at the boundary between\nclassical nanomechanics and quantum information fields, are prerequisite in the\nunderstanding of decoherence processes in mechanical devices, both classical\nand quantum.\n", "  To survive environmental conditions, cells transcribe their response\nactivities into encoded mRNA sequences in order to produce certain amounts of\nprotein concentrations. The external conditions are mapped into the cell\nthrough the activation of special proteins called transcription factors (TFs).\nDue to the difficult task to measure experimentally TF behaviours, and the\nchallenges to capture their quick-time dynamics, different types of models\nbased on differential equations have been proposed. However, those approaches\nusually incur in costly procedures, and they present problems to describe\nsudden changes in TF regulators. In this paper, we present a switched dynamical\nlatent force model for reverse-engineering transcriptional regulation in gene\nexpression data which allows the exact inference over latent TF activities\ndriving some observed gene expressions through a linear differential equation.\nTo deal with discontinuities in the dynamics, we introduce an approach that\nswitches between different TF activities and different dynamical systems. This\ncreates a versatile representation of transcription networks that can capture\ndiscrete changes and non-linearities We evaluate our model on both simulated\ndata and real-data (e.g. microaerobic shift in E. coli, yeast respiration),\nconcluding that our framework allows for the fitting of the expression data\nwhile being able to infer continuous-time TF profiles.\n", "  Recent experimental realization of long sought Weyl fermions in non-magnetic\ncrystals has greatly motivated condensed matter physicists to search for\nmaterials supporting Weyl fermions. Weyl fermions appear to be very promising\nfor future electronics, often referred as Weyltronics. Here, by means of\nfirst-principle calculations, we report a stoichiometric crystal structure of\nBiSb with broken space-inversion symmetry. This structure is insulating in bulk\nand has non-trivial band topology. We observe a pressure driven Weyl\nsemi-metallic phase transition in this crystal structure. The obtained Weyl\nsemi-metallic phase exists in the 4.0 - 6.0 GPa pressure range. We find that a\ntotal 6 pairs of Weyl points, 6 monopoles and 6 antimonopoles, exist in the\nBrillouin zone. The Weyl points with opposite chirality are located at\ndifferent energy values yielding separate electron and hole Fermi-surfaces.\nAdditionally, the spin-texture of the bulk BiSb compound appears to be\nelectrically controllable when the interlink between pressure and an electric\nfield is exploited. This produces novel manipulable topological transport\nproperties in this system which are very promising for implementation of this\nkind of materials in next-generation Weyltronics and spintronic devices.\n", "  We report on our recent efforts to perform realistic simulations of large\nquantum devices in the time domain. In contrast to d.c. transport where the\ncalculations are explicitly performed at the Fermi level, the presence of\ntime-dependent terms in the Hamiltonian makes the system inelastic so that it\nis necessary to explicitly enforce the Pauli principle in the simulations. We\nillustrate our approach with calculations for a flying qubit interferometer, a\nnanoelectronic device that is currently under experimental investigation. Our\ncalculations illustrate the fact that many degrees of freedom (16,700\ntight-binding sites in the scattering region) and long simulation times (80,000\ntimes the inverse Bandwidth of the tight-binding model) can be easily achieved\non a local computer.\n", "  I propose classical and quantum limits to the statistical resolution of two\nincoherent optical point sources from the perspective of minimax parameter\nestimation. Unlike earlier results based on the Cram\\'er-Rao bound, the limits\nproposed here, based on the worst-case error criterion and a Bayesian version\nof the Cram\\'er-Rao bound, are valid for any biased or unbiased estimator and\nobey photon-number scalings that are consistent with the behaviors of actual\nestimators. These results prove that, from the minimax perspective, the\nspatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) measurement scheme recently proposed by\nTsang, Nair, and Lu [Phys. Rev. X 6, 031033 (2016)] remains superior to direct\nimaging for sufficiently high photon numbers.\n", "  We present a general framework for the construction of quantum tensor product\ncodes (QTPC). In a classical tensor product code (TPC), its parity check matrix\nis con- structed via the tensor product of parity check matrices of the two\ncomponent codes. We show that by adding some constraints on the component\ncodes, several classes of dual-containing TPCs can be obtained. By selecting\ndifferent types of component codes, the proposed method enables the\nconstruction of a large family of QTPCs and they can provide a wide variety of\nquantum error control abilities. In particular, if one of the component codes\nis selected as a burst-error-correction code, then QTPCs have quantum\nmultiple-burst-error-correction abilities, provided these bursts fall in\ndistinct subblocks. Compared with concatenated quantum codes (CQC), the\ncomponent code selections of QTPCs are much more exible than those of CQCs\nsince only one of the component codes of QTPCs needs to satisfy the\ndual-containing restriction. We show that it is possible to construct QTPCs\nwith parameters better than other classes of quantum error-correction codes\n(QECC), e.g., CQCs and quantum BCH codes. Many QTPCs are obtained with\nparameters better than previously known quantum codes available in the\nliterature. Several classes of QTPCs that can correct multiple quantum bursts\nof errors are constructed based on reversible cyclic codes and\nmaximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes.\n", "  Optomechanical coupling between the motion of a mechanical oscillator and a\ncavity represents a new arena for experimental investigation of quantum effects\non the mesoscopic and macroscopic scale.The motional sidebands of the output of\na cavity offer ultra-sensitive probes of the dynamics. We introduce a scheme\nwhereby these sidebands split asymmetrically and show how they may be used as\nexperimental diagnostics and signatures of quantum noise limited dynamics. We\nshow split-sidebands with controllable asymmetry occur by simultaneously\nmodulating the light-mechanical coupling $g$ and $\\omega_M$ - slowly and out\nof-phase. Such modulations are generic but already occur in optically trapped\nset-ups where the equilibrium point of the oscillator is varied cyclically. We\nanalyse recently observed, but overlooked, experimental split-sideband\nasymmetries; although not yet in the quantum regime, the data suggests that\nsplit sideband structures are easily accessible to future experiments.\n", "  Telecom photonic quantum networks with matter quantum systems enable a rich\nvariety of applications, such as a long distance quantum cryptography and\none-way quantum computing. Preparation of a heralded single excitation (HSE) in\nan atomic ensemble by detecting a telecom wavelength photon having a\ncorrelation with the atomic excitation is an important step. Such a system has\nbeen demonstrated with a quantum frequency conversion (QFC) to telecom\nwavelength employing a Rb atomic cloud. However the limited wavelength\nselection prevents the next step. Here we for the first time demonstrate HSE\nwith a solid-state-based QFC and a detector for a telecom wavelength that will\nhave a great advantage of the utility of mature telecom technologies. We\nunambiguously show that the demonstrated HSE indicates a non-classical\nstatistics by the direct measurement of the autocorrelation function.\n", "  Modern theories of quantum magnetism predict exotic multipolar states in\nweakly interacting strongly frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains with\nferromagnetic nearest neighbor (NN) inchain exchange in high magnetic fields.\nExperimentally these states remained elusive so far. Here we report the\nevidence for a long-sought magnetic field-induced nematic state arising above a\nfield of $\\sim 13$ T in the edge-sharing chain cuprate LiSbCuO$_4$ $\\equiv$\nLiCuSbO$_4$. This interpretation is based on the observation of a field induced\nspin-gap in the measurements of the $^7$Li NMR spin relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$\nas well as a contrasting field-dependent power-law behavior of $T_1^{-1}$ vs.\n$T$ and is further supported by static magnetization and ESR data. An\nunderlying theoretical microscopic approach favoring a nematic scenario is\nbased essentially on the NN XYZ exchange anisotropy within a model for\nfrustrated spin-1/2 chains. It is investigated by the DMRG technique. The\nemployed exchange parameters are justified qualitatively by electronic\nstructure calculations for LiCuSbO$_4$.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate a proposal [Phys. Rev. A 87, 052325 (2013)] of\na scheme for robust distribution of polarization entangled photon pairs over\ncollective noisy channels having the reciprocity. Although the scheme employs\nthe robustness of two qubit decoherence-free subspace, by utilizing the forward\npropagation of one half of the entangled photons and the backward propagation\nof a classical reference light, it achieves an entanglement-sharing rate\nproportional to the transmittance of the quantum channel for the signal photon.\nWe experimentally observed the efficient sharing rate while keeping a highly\nentangled state after the transmission. We also show that the protection method\nis applicable to transmission of arbitrary polarization state of a single\nphoton.\n", "  In this paper, we continue our study on the curvaton model with nonminimal\nderivative coupling (NDC) to Einstein gravity proposed in our previous work,\nfocusing on the reheating mechanism. We found that according to whether the\ncurvaton has dominated the background after the end of inflation, it will have\ntwo different behaviors of evolution, which should be the general property of\ncurvaton with nonminimal couplings. This will cause diffferent rates of\nparticle creation, which goes on via the parametric resonance process. The\nreheating temperature is estimated for both cases in which reheating completes\nbefore and after curvaton domination, and the constraints are quite loose\ncompared to that of overproduction of gravitino. Finally we investigated the\nevolution of curvature perturbation during reheating. We have shown both\nanalytically and numerically that the curvature perturbation will not blow up\nduring the resonance process.\n", "  We rewrite the recently proposed differential expansion formula for HOMFLY\npolynomials of the knot $4_1$ in arbitrary rectangular representation $R=[r^s]$\nas a sum over all Young sub-diagrams $\\lambda$ of $R$ with extraordinary simple\ncoefficients $D_{\\lambda^{tr}}(r)\\cdot D_\\lambda(s)$ in front of the\n$Z$-factors. Somewhat miraculously, these coefficients are made from quantum\ndimensions of symmetric representations of the groups $SL(r)$ and $SL(s)$ and\nrestrict summation to diagrams with no more than $s$ rows and $r$ columns. They\npossess a natural $\\beta$-deformation to Macdonald dimensions and produces\npositive Laurent polynomials, which can be considered as plausible candidates\nfor the role of the rectangular superpolynomials. Both polynomiality and\npositivity are non-evident properties of arising expressions, still they are\ntrue. This extends the previous suggestions for symmetric and antisymmetric\nrepresentations (when $s=1$ or $r=1$ respectively) to arbitrary rectangular\nrepresentations. As usual for differential expansion, there are additional\ngradings. In the only example, available for comparison -- that of the trefoil\nknot $3_1$, to which our results for $4_1$ are straightforwardly extended, --\none of them reproduces the \"fourth grading\" for hyperpolynomials. Factorization\nproperties are nicely preserved even in the 5-graded case.\n", "  Quantum gravity may allow black holes to tunnel into white holes. If so, the\nlifetime of a black hole could be shorter than the one given by Hawking\nevaporation, solving the information paradox. More interestingly, this could\nopen to a new window for quantum-gravity phenomenology, in connection with the\nexistence of primordial black holes. We discuss in particular the power of the\nassociated explosion and the possibility to observe an astrophysical signal in\nthe radio and in the gamma wavelengths.\n", "  Grand canonical equilibrium states of a continuum system of interacting\nparticles are studied. The particles are placed in the space $\\mathbb{R}^d$\ndivided into congruent cubic cells. For a region $V\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$\nconsisting of $N\\in \\mathbb{N}$ cells, every two particles contained in $V$\nattract each other with intensity $J_1/N$. The particles contained in the same\ncell are subject to binary repulsion with intensity $J_2>J_1$. For fixed values\nof the temperature, the interaction intensities and the chemical potential, the\nthermodynamic phase is defined as a probability measure on the space of\noccupation numbers of cells, determined by a condition typical to Curie-Weiss\ntheories. There is proved that the half-plane $J_1\\times$\\textit{ chemical\npotential} contains phase coexistence points at which two thermodynamic phases\nof the system exist. An equation of state for this system is obtained. Some\nillustrating numerical results are also presented.\n", "  We present a new computational approach, Action-CSA, to sample multiple\nreaction pathways with fixed initial and final states through global\noptimization of the Onsager-Machlup action using the conformational space\nannealing method. This approach successfully samples not only the most dominant\npathway but also many other possible paths without initial guesses on reaction\npathways. Pathway space is efficiently sampled by crossover operations of a set\nof paths and preserving the diversity of sampled pathways. The sampling ability\nof the approach is assessed by finding pathways for the conformational changes\nof alanine dipeptide and hexane. The benchmarks demonstrate that the rank order\nand the transition time distribution of multiple pathways identified by the new\napproach are in good agreement with those of long molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We also show that the lowest action folding pathway of the\nmini-protein FSD-1 identified by the new approach is consistent with previous\nmolecular dynamics simulations and experiments.\n", "  Ideal MHD relaxation is the topology-conserving reconfiguration of a magnetic\nfield into a lower energy state where the net force is zero. This is achieved\nby modeling the plasma as perfectly conducting viscous fluid. It is an\nimportant tool for investigating plasma equilibria and is often used to study\nthe magnetic configurations in fusion devices and astrophysical plasmas. We\nstudy the equilibrium reached by a localized magnetic field through the\ntopology conserving relaxation of a magnetic field based on the Hopf fibration\nin which magnetic field lines are closed circles that are all linked with one\nanother. Magnetic fields with this topology have recently been shown to occur\nin non-ideal numerical simulations. Our results show that any localized field\ncan only attain equilibrium if there is a finite external pressure, and that\nfor such a field a Taylor state is unattainable. We find an equilibrium plasma\nconfiguration that is characterized by a lowered pressure in a toroidal region,\nwith field lines lying on surfaces of constant pressure. Therefore, the field\nis in a Grad-Shafranov equilibrium. Localized helical magnetic fields are found\nwhen plasma is ejected from astrophysical bodies and subsequently relaxes\nagainst the background plasma, as well as on earth in plasmoids generated by\ne.g.\\ a Marshall gun. This work shows under which conditions an equilibrium can\nbe reached and identifies a toroidal depression as the characteristic feature\nof such a configuration.\n", "  Artificial phoretic particles swim using self-generated gradients in chemical\nspecies (self-diffusiophoresis) or charges and currents (self-electrophoresis).\nThese particles can be used to study the physics of collective motion in active\nmatter and might have promising applications in bioengineering. In the case of\nself-diffusiophoresis, the classical physical model relies on a steady solution\nof the diffusion equation, from which chemical gradients, phoretic flows and\nultimately the swimming velocity, may be derived. Motivated by disk-shaped\nparticles in thin films and under confinement, we examine the extension to two\ndimensions. Because the two-dimensional diffusion equation lacks a steady state\nwith the correct boundary conditions, Laplace transforms must be used to study\nthe long-time behavior of the problem and determine the swimming velocity. For\nfixed chemical fluxes on the particle surface, we find that the swimming\nvelocity ultimately always decays logarithmically in time. In the case of\nfinite Peclet numbers, we solve the full advection-diffusion equation\nnumerically and show that this decay can be avoided by the particle moving to\nregions of unconsumed reactant. Finite advection thus regularizes the\ntwo-dimensional phoretic problem.\n", "  Bad metals have a large resistivity without being strongly disordered. In\nmany bad metals the Drude peak moves away from zero frequency as the\nresistivity becomes large at increasing temperatures. We catalogue the position\nand width of the `displaced Drude peak' in the observed optical conductivity of\nseveral families of bad metals, showing that $\\omega_\\text{peak} \\sim \\Delta\n\\omega \\sim k_BT/\\hbar$. This is the same quantum critical timescale that\nunderpins the $T$-linear dc resistivity of many of these materials. We provide\na unified theoretical description of the optical and dc transport properties of\nbad metals in terms of the hydrodynamics of short range quantum critical\nfluctuations of incommensurate density wave order. Within hydrodynamics, pinned\ntranslational order is essential to obtain the nonzero frequency peak.\n", "  In this review we present the potentialities and the achievements of the use\nof non-classical photon number correlations in twin beams (TWB) states for many\napplications, ranging from imaging to metrology. Photon number correlations in\nthe quantum regime are easy to be produced and are rather robust against\nunavoidable experimental losses, and noise in some cases, if compared to the\nentanglement, where loosing one photon can completely compromise the state and\nits exploitable advantage. Here, we will focus on quantum enhanced protocols in\nwhich only phase-insensitive intensity measurements (photon number counting)\nare performed, which allow probing transmission/absorption properties of a\nsystem, leading for example to innovative target detection schemes in a strong\nbackground. In this framework, one of the advantages is that the sources\nexperimentally available emit a wide number of pairwise correlated modes, which\ncan be intercepted and exploited separately, for example by many pixels of a\ncamera, providing a parallelism, essential in several applications, like wide\nfield sub-shot-noise imaging and quantum enhanced ghost imaging. Finally,\nnon-classical correlation enables new possibilities in quantum radiometry, e.g.\nthe possibility of absolute calibration of a spatial resolving detector from\nthe on-off- single photon regime to the linear regime, in the same setup.\n", "  Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a powerful and accurate tool exploited in\nNuclear Physics to investigate the ground-state and some collective properties\nof nuclei along the whole nuclear chart. Models based on DFT are, however, not\nsuitable for the description of single-particle dynamics in nuclei. Following\nthe field theoretical approach by A. Bohr and B. R. Mottelson to describe\nnuclear interactions between single-particle and vibrational degrees of\nfreedom, we have undertaken important steps to build a microscopic dynamic\nnuclear model. In connection to that, one important issue that needs to be\nbetter understood is the renormalization of the effective interaction in the\nparticle-vibration approach. One possible way to renormalize the interaction is\nthe so called {\\it subtraction method}. In this contribution we will implement\nthe {\\it subtraction method} for the first time in our model and study its\nconsequences.\n", "  Assume that $T$ is a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$\nand that the spectrum of $T$ is confined in the union $\\bigcup_{j\\in\nJ}\\Delta_j$, $J\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}$, of segments $\\Delta_j=[\\alpha_j,\n\\beta_j]\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\alpha_{j+1}>\\beta_j$ and $$ \\inf_{j}\n\\left(\\alpha_{j+1}-\\beta_j\\right) = d > 0. $$ If $B$ is a bounded (in general\nnon-self-adjoint) perturbation of $T$ with $\\|B\\|=:b<d/2$ then the spectrum of\nthe perturbed operator $A=T+B$ lies in the union $\\bigcup_{j\\in J}\nU_{b}(\\Delta_j)$ of the mutually disjoint closed $b$-neighborhoods\n$U_{b}(\\Delta_j)$ of the segments $\\Delta_j$ in $\\mathbb{C}$. Let $Q_j$ be the\nRiesz projection onto the invariant subspace of $A$ corresponding to the part\nof the spectrum of $A$ lying in $U_{b}\\left(\\Delta_j\\right)$, $j\\in J$. Our\nmain result is as follows: The subspaces $\\mathcal{L}_j=Q_j(\\mathcal H)$, $j\\in\nJ$, form an unconditional basis in the whole space $\\mathcal H$.\n", "  We continue the investigation of the structure of the action for a tower of\nconformal higher spin fields in non-trivial 4d background metric recently\ndiscussed in arXiv:1609.09381. The action is defined as an induced one from\npath integral of a conformal scalar field in curved background coupled to\nhigher spin fields. We analyse in detail the dependence of the quadratic part\nof the induced action on the spin 1 and spin 3 fields, determining the presence\nof a curvature-dependent mixed spin 1 - spin 3 term. One consequence is that\nthe pure spin 3 kinetic term cannot be gauge-invariant on its own beyond the\nleading term in small curvature expansion. We also compute the non-zero\ncontribution of the 1-3 mixing term to the conformal anomaly c-coefficient. One\nis thus to determine all such mixing terms before addressing the question of\npossible vanishing of the total c-coefficient in the conformal higher spin\ntheory.\n", "  We introduce a new discrete coherence monotone named the \\emph{coherence\nnumber}, which is a generalization of the coherence rank to mixed states. After\ndefining the coherence number in a similar manner to the Schmidt number in\nentanglement theory, we present a necessary and sufficient condition of the\ncoherence number for a coherent state to be converted to an entangled state of\nnonzero $k$-concurrence (a member of the generalized concurrence family with\n$2\\le k \\le d$). It also turns out that the coherence number is a useful\nmeasure to understand the process of Grover search algorithm of $N$ items. We\nshow that the coherence number remains $N$ and falls abruptly when the success\nprobability of the searching process becomes maximal. This phenomenon motivates\nus to analyze the depletion pattern of $C_c^{(N)}$ (the last member of the\ngeneralized coherence concurrence, nonzero when the coherence number is $N$),\nwhich turns out to be an optimal resource for the process since it is\ncompletely consumed to finish the searching task.\n", "  We study the large fluctuations of emitted radiations in the system of $N$\nnon-interacting two-level atoms. Two methods are used to calculate the\nprobability of the large fluctuations and the time dependence of the excitation\nand emission. The first method is based on the large deviation principle for\nMarkov processes. The second one uses an analogue of the quantum formalism for\nclassical probability problems. Particularly we prove that in a large\nfluctuation limit approximately a half of the atoms are excited. This fact is\nindependent on the fraction of the excited atoms in the stationary state.\n", "  Analogs of the high-T$_c$ cuprates have been long sought after in transition\nmetal oxides. Due to the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the $5d$ perovskite\niridates Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ exhibit a low-energy electronic structure remarkably\nsimilar to the cuprates. Whether a superconducting state exists as in the\ncuprates requires understanding the correlated spin-orbit entangled electronic\nstates. Recent experiments discovered hidden order in the parent and electron\ndoped iridates, some with striking analogies to the cuprates, including Fermi\nsurface pockets, Fermi arcs, and pseudogap. Here, we study the correlation and\ndisorder effects in a five-orbital model derived from the band theory. We find\nthat the experimental observations are consistent with a $d$-wave spin-orbit\ndensity wave order that breaks the symmetry of a joint two-fold spin-orbital\nrotation followed by a lattice translation. There is a Berry phase and a\nplaquette spin flux due to spin procession as electrons hop between Ir atoms,\nakin to the intersite SOC in quantum spin Hall insulators. The associated\nstaggered circulating $J_\\text{eff}=1/2$ spin current can be probed by advanced\ntechniques of spin-current detection in spintronics. This electronic order can\nemerge spontaneously from the intersite Coulomb interactions between the\nspatially extended iridium $5d$ orbitals, turning the metallic state into an\nelectron doped quasi-2D Dirac semimetal with important implications on the\npossible superconducting state suggested by recent experiments.\n", "  Heat fluxes in a district heating pipeline systems need to be controlled on\nthe scale from minutes to an hour to adjust to evolving demand. There are two\nprincipal ways to control the heat flux - keep temperature fixed but adjust\nvelocity of the carrier (typically water) or keep the velocity flow steady but\nthen adjust temperature at the heat producing source (heat plant). We study the\nlatter scenario, commonly used for operations in Russia and Nordic countries,\nand analyze dynamics of the heat front as it propagates through the system.\nSteady velocity flows in the district heating pipelines are typically turbulent\nand incompressible. Changes in the heat, on either consumption or production\nsides, lead to slow transients which last from tens of minutes to hours. We\nclassify relevant physical phenomena in a single pipe, e.g. turbulent spread of\nthe turbulent front. We then explain how to describe dynamics of temperature\nand heat flux evolution over a network efficiently and illustrate the network\nsolution on a simple example involving one producer and one consumer of heat\nconnected by \"hot\" and \"cold\" pipes. We conclude the manuscript motivating\nfuture research directions.\n", "  Supersymmetric systems derive their properties from conserved supercharges\nwhich form a supersymmetric algebra. These systems naturally factorize into two\nsubsystems, which, when considered as individual systems, have essentially the\nsame eigenenergies, and their eigenstates can be mapped onto each other. We\nfirst propose a one-dimensional ultracold atom setup to realize such a pair of\nsupersymmetric systems. We propose a Mach-Zehnder interference experiment which\nwe demonstrate for this system, and which can be realized with current\ntechnology. In this interferometer, a single atom wave packet that evolves in a\nsuperposition of the subsystems, gives an interference contrast that is sharply\npeaked if the subsystems form a supersymmetric pair. Secondly, we propose a\ntwo-dimensional setup that implements supersymmetric dynamics in a synthetic\ngauge field.\n", "  We present an improved Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) calculation of tunnel\nsplitting in one dimensional asymmetric double well potentials. We show that\nthe tunnel splitting in general can have linear dependence on the bias energy,\nbeside the well-known quadratic dependence. We demonstrate that the linear\ncorrection is greater than previously thought.\n", "  Most physicists do not have patience for reading long and obscure\ninterpretation arguments and disputes. Hence, to attract attention of a wider\nphysics community, in this paper various old and new aspects of quantum\ninterpretations are explained in a concise and simple (almost trivial) form.\nAbout the \"Copenhagen\" interpretation, we note that there are several different\nversions of it and explain how to make sense of \"local non-reality\"\ninterpretation. About the many-world interpretation, we explain that it is\nneither local nor non-local, that it cannot explain the Born rule, that it\nsuffers from the preferred basis problem, and that quantum suicide cannot be\nused to test it. About the Bohmian interpretation, we explain that it is\nanalogous to dark matter, use it to explain that there is no big difference\nbetween non-local correlation and non-local causation, and use some\ncondensed-matter ideas to outline how non-relativistic Bohmian theory could be\na theory of everything. We also explain how different interpretations can be\nused to demystify the delayed choice experiment, to resolve the problem of time\nin quantum gravity, and to provide alternatives to quantum non-locality.\nFinally, we explain why is life compatible with the 2nd law.\n", "  We define a discrete-time, coined quantum walk on weighted graphs that is\ninspired by Szegedy's quantum walk. Using this, we prove that many\nlackadaisical quantum walks, where each vertex has $l$ integer self-loops, can\nbe generalized to a quantum walk where each vertex has a single self-loop of\nreal-valued weight $l$. We apply this real-valued lackadaisical quantum walk to\ntwo problems. First, we analyze it on the line or one-dimensional lattice,\nshowing that it is exactly equivalent to a continuous deformation of the\nthree-state Grover walk with faster ballistic dispersion. Second, we generalize\nGrover's algorithm, or search on the complete graph, to have a weighted\nself-loop at each vertex, yielding an improved success probability when $l < 3\n+ 2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 5.828$.\n", "  We perform a comparative study of the reach of future $e^+e^-$ collider\noptions for the scale of non-resonant new physics effects in the top quark\nsector, phrased in the language of higher-dimensional operators. Our focus is\non the electroweak top quark pair production process $e^+e^- \\to Z^*/\\gamma \\to\nt\\bar t $, and we study benchmark scenarios at the ILC and CLIC. We find that\nboth are able to constrain mass scales up to the few TeV range in the most\nsensitive cases, improving by orders of magnitude on the forecasted\ncapabilities of the LHC. We discuss the role played by observables such as\nforward-backward asymmetries, and making use of different beam polarisation\nsettings, and highlight the possibility of lifting a degeneracy in the allowed\nparameter space by combining top observables with precision $Z$-pole\nmeasurements from LEP1.\n", "  We study an accumulation mode Si/SiGe double quantum dot (DQD) containing a\nsingle electron that is dipole coupled to microwave photons in a\nsuperconducting cavity. Measurements of the cavity transmission reveal\ndispersive features due to the DQD valley states in Si. The occupation of the\nvalley states can be increased by raising temperature or applying a finite\nsource-drain bias across the DQD, resulting in an increased signal. Using\ncavity input-output theory and a four-level model of the DQD, it is possible to\nefficiently extract valley splittings and the inter- and intra-valley tunnel\ncouplings.\n", "  We investigate the effect of $k$-cubic spin-orbit interaction on electrical\nand thermoelectric transport properties of two-dimensional fermionic systems.\nWe obtain exact analytical expressions of the inverse relaxation time (IRT) and\nthe Drude conductivity for long-range Coulomb and short-range delta scattering\npotentials. The IRT reveals that the scattering is completely suppressed along\nthe three directions $\\theta^\\prime = (2n+1)\\pi/3 $ with $ n=1,2,3$. We also\nobtain analytical results of the thermopower and thermal conductivity at low\ntemperature. The thermoelectric transport coefficients obey the Wiedemann-Franz\nlaw, even in the presence of $k$-cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) at low\ntemperature. In the presence of quantizing magnetic field, the signature of the\nRSOC is revealed through the appearance of the beating pattern in the\nShubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of thermopower and thermal conductivity in\nlow magnetic field regime. The empirical formulae for the SdH oscillation\nfrequencies accurately describe the locations of the beating nodes. The beating\npattern in magnetothermoelectric measurement can be used to extract the\nspin-orbit coupling constant.\n", "  Spin torque oscillators placed onto a nonmagnetic heavy metal show\nsynchronized auto-oscillations due to the coupling originating from spin Hall\nmagnetoresistance effect. Here, we study a system having two spin torque\noscillators under the effect of the spin Hall torque, and show that switching\nthe external current direction enables us to control the phase difference of\nthe synchronization between in-phase and antiphase.\n", "  Here we study the resistive switching (RS) effect that emerges when\nferroelectric BaTiO$_{3}$ (BTO) and few-layers MoSe$_{2}$ are combined in one\nsingle structure. The C-V loops reveal the ferroelectric nature of both\nAl/Si/SiO$_{x}$/BTO/Au and Al/Si/SiO$_{x}$/MoSe$_{2}$/BTO/Au structures and the\nhigh quality of the SiO$_{x}$/MoSe$_{2}$ interface in the\nAl/Si/SiOx/MoSe$_{2}$/Au structure. Al/Si/SiO$_{x}$/MoSe$_{2}$/BTO/Au hybrid\nstructures show the electroforming free resistive switching that is explained\non the basis of the modulation of the potential distribution at the\nMoSe$_{2}$/BTO interface via ferroelectric polarization flipping. This\nstructure shows promising resistive switching characteristics with switching\nratio of $\\approx{}$10$^{2}$ and a stable memory window, which are highly\nrequired for memory applications.\n", "  A monitoring and management system for the thermal environment inside the\nBorexino neutrino detector was developed and installed in order to reduce\nuncertainties in temperature determination and limit undesirable thermal\ncouplings between the environment and Borexino's active sections. This strategy\nis bringing improved radioactive background conditions to the physics signal\nthanks to the reduced mixing taking place in the liquid scintillator. While\nequilibrium has not yet been reached, and fine-tuning is possible, the system\nhas proven extremely effective at greatly stabilizing the detector while\noffering precise insight into its internal thermal conditions and transport.\nNumerical simulations have also been used to feed this empirical data into a\nglobal model, providing information into present and future thermal trends.\n", "  We compare phenomenological results from 3+1d quasiparticle anisotropic\nhydrodynamics (aHydroQP) with experimental data collected in LHC 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb\ncollisions. In particular, we present comparisons of particle spectra, average\ntransverse momentum, elliptic flow, and HBT radii. The aHydroQP model relies on\nthe introduction of a single temperature-dependent quasiparticle mass which is\nfit to lattice QCD data. By taking moments of the resulting Boltzmann equation,\nwe obtain the dynamical equations used in the hydrodynamic stage which include\nthe effects of both shear and bulk viscosities. At freeze-out, we use\nanisotropic Cooper-Frye freeze-out performed on a fixed-energy-density\nhypersurface to convert to hadrons. To model the production and decays of the\nhadrons we use THERMINATOR 2 which is customized to sample from ellipsoidal\nmomentum-space distribution functions. Using smooth Glauber initial conditions,\nwe find very good agreement with many heavy-ion collision observables.\n", "  The particle flow approach to calorimetry benefits from highly granular\ncalorimeters and sophisticated software algorithms in order to reconstruct and\nidentify individual particles in complex event topologies. The high spatial\ngranularity, together with analogue energy information, can be further\nexploited in software compensation. In this approach, the local energy density\nis used to discriminate electromagnetic and purely hadronic sub-showers within\nhadron showers in the detector to improve the energy resolution for single\nparticles by correcting for the intrinsic non-compensation of the calorimeter\nsystem. This improvement in the single particle energy resolution also results\nin a better overall jet energy resolution by improving the energy measurement\nof identified neutral hadrons and improvements in the pattern recognition stage\nby a more accurate matching of calorimeter energies to tracker measurements.\nThis paper describes the software compensation technique and its implementation\nin particle flow reconstruction with the Pandora Particle Flow Algorithm\n(PandoraPFA). The impact of software compensation on the choice of optimal\ntransverse granularity for the analogue hadronic calorimeter option of the\nInternational Large Detector (ILD) concept is also discussed.\n", "  We develop a non-singular theory of three-dimensional dislocation loops in a\nparticular version of Mindlin's anisotropic gradient elasticity with up to six\nlength scale parameters. The theory is systematically developed as a\ngeneralization of the classical anisotropic theory in the framework of\nlinearized incompatible elasticity. The non-singular version of all key\nequations of anisotropic dislocation theory are derived as line integrals,\nincluding the Burgers displacement equation with isolated solid angle, the\nPeach-Koehler stress equation, the Mura-Willis equation for the elastic\ndistortion, and the Peach-Koehler force. The expression for the interaction\nenergy between two dislocation loops as a double line integral is obtained\ndirectly, without the use of a stress function. It is shown that all the\nelastic fields are non-singular, and that they converge to their classical\ncounterparts a few characteristic lengths away from the dislocation core. In\npractice, the non-singular fields can be obtained from the classical ones by\nreplacing the classical (singular) anisotropic Green's tensor with the\nnon-singular anisotropic Green's tensor derived by \\cite{Lazar:2015ja}. The\nelastic solution is valid for arbitrary anisotropic media. In addition to the\nclassical anisotropic elastic constants, the non-singular Green's tensor\ndepends on a second order symmetric tensor of length scale parameters modeling\na weak non-locality, whose structure depends on the specific class of crystal\nsymmetry. The anisotropic Helmholtz operator defined by such tensor admits a\nGreen's function which is used as the spreading function for the Burgers vector\ndensity. As a consequence, the Burgers vector density spreads differently in\ndifferent crystal structures.\n", "  We study continuous-wave light propagation through a twisted birefringent\nsingle-mode fiber amplifier with saturable nonlinearity. The corresponding\ncoupled-mode system is isomorphic to a non-Hermitian nonlinear dimer, and gives\nrise to analytic polarization-mode dynamics. It provides an optical simulation\nof the semi-classical non-Hermitian Bose-Hubbard model, and suggests its use\nfor the design of polarization circulators and filters, as well as sources of\npolarized light.\n", "  The evidence for macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in Josephson junctions\nat low temperatures has been reassessed. Swept bias escape distributions have\nbeen modeled with an algorithm-based simulation and the results compared with\ndata from representative published experiments. Signatures expected of a\ncrossover to MQT are not found in the analyzed data.\n", "  We present the inner products of eigenstates in integrable Richardson-Gaudin\nmodels from two different perspectives and derive two classes of Gaudin-like\ndeterminant expressions for such inner products. The requirement that one of\nthe states is on-shell arises naturally by demanding that a state has a dual\nrepresentation. By implicitly combining these different representations, inner\nproducts can be recast as domain wall boundary partition functions. The\nstructure of all involved matrices in terms of Cauchy matrices is made explicit\nand used to show how one of the classes returns the Slavnov determinant\nformula. This framework provides a further connection between two different\napproaches for integrable models, one in which everything is expressed in terms\nof rapidities satisfying Bethe equations, and one in which everything is\nexpressed in terms of the eigenvalues of conserved charges, satisfying\nquadratic equations.\n", "  We analyse the performance of a gas time projection chamber (TPC) as a\nhigh-performance gamma-ray telescope and polarimeter in the e$^+$e$^-$ pair\ncreation regime. We use data collected at a gamma-ray beam of known\npolarisation. The TPC provides two orthogonal projections $(x,z)$ and $(y,z)$\nof the tracks induced by each conversion in the gas volume. We use a simple\nvertex finder in which vertices and pseudo-tracks exiting from them are\nidentified.\n  We study the various contributions to the single-photon angular resolution\nusing Monte Carlo simulations and compare them with the experimental data and\nfind that they are in excellent agreement. The distribution of the azimutal\nangle of pair conversions shows a bias due to the non-cylindrical-symmetric\nstructure of the detector. This bias would average out for a long duration\nexposure on a space mission, but for this pencil-beam characterisation we have\nensured its accurate simulation by a double systematics control scheme, data\ntaking with the detector rotated at several angles with respect to the beam\npolarisation direction and systematics control with a non-polarised beam.\n  We measure, for the first time, the polarisation asymmetry of a linearly\npolarised gamma-ray beam in the low energy pair creation regime. This sub-GeV\nenergy range is critical for cosmic sources as their spectra are power laws\nwhich fall quickly as a function of increasing energy.\n  This work could pave the way to extending polarised gamma-ray astronomy\nbeyond the MeV energy regime.\n", "  It is believed that any classical gauge symmetry gives rise to an L$_\\infty$\nalgebra. Based on the recently realized relation between classical ${\\cal W}$\nalgebras and L$_\\infty$ algebras, we analyze how this generalizes to the\nquantum case. Guided by the existence of quantum ${\\cal W}$ algebras, we\nprovide a physically well motivated definition of quantum L$_\\infty$ algebras\ndescribing the consistency of global symmetries in quantum field theories. In\nthis case we are restricted to only two non-trivial graded vector spaces $X_0$\nand $X_{-1}$ containing the symmetry variations and the symmetry generators.\nThis quantum L$_\\infty$ algebra structure is explicitly exemplified for the\nquantum ${\\cal W}_3$ algebra. The natural quantum product between fields is the\nnormal ordered one so that, due to contractions between quantum fields, the\nhigher L$_\\infty$ relations receive off-diagonal quantum corrections.\nCuriously, these are not present in the loop L$_\\infty$ algebra of closed\nstring field theory.\n", "  The energy-based methods as the Dispersion Relation (DR) and Response Theory\nof Optical Forces (RTOF) have been largely applied to obtain the optical forces\nin the nano-optomechanical devices, in contrast to the Maxwell Stress Tensor\n(MST). In this work, we apply first principles to show explicitly why these\nmethods must agree with the MST formalism in linear lossless systems. We apply\nthe RTOF multi-port, to show that the optical force expression on these devices\ncan be extended to analyze multiple light sources, broadband sources, and\nmultimode devices, with multiple degrees of freedom. We also show that the DR\nmethod, when expressed as a function of the derivative of the effective index\nperformed at a fixed wave vector, may be misinterpreted and lead to\noverestimated results.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on radial symmetry center\nmethod to track colloidal particles close to contact, where the optical images\nof the particles start to overlap in digital video microscopy. This overlapping\neffect is important to observe the pair interaction potential in colloidal\nstudies and it appears as additional interaction in the measurement of the\ninteraction with conventional tracking analysis. The proposed algorithm in this\nwork is simple, fast and applicable for not only two particles but also three\nand more particles without any modification. The algorithm uses gradient\nvectors of the particle intensity distribution, which allows us to use a part\nof the symmetric intensity distribution in the calculation of the actual\nparticle position. In this study, simulations are performed to see the\nperformance of the proposed algorithm for two and three particles, where the\nsimulation images are generated by using fitted curve to experimental particle\nimage for different sized particles. As a result, the algorithm yields the\nmaximum error smaller than 2 nm for 5.53 {\\mu}m silica particles in contact\ncondition.\n", "  The dynamical behavior of interacting systems plays a fundamental role for\ndetermining quantum correlations, such as entanglement. In this Letter, we\ndescribe temporal quantum effects of the inseparable evolution of composite\nquantum states by comparing the trajectories to their classically correlated\ncounterparts. For this reason, we introduce equations of motions describing the\nseparable propagation of any interacting quantum system, which are derived by\nrequiring separability for all times. The resulting Schroedinger-type equations\nallow for comparing the trajectories in a separable configuration with the\nactual behavior of the system and, thereby, identifying inseparable and\ntime-dependent quantum properties. As an example, we study bipartite discrete-\nand continuous-variable interacting systems. The generalization of our\ndeveloped technique to multipartite scenarios is also provided.\n", "  We developed a sharp interface level-set approach for two-phase immiscible\nflow with moving contact lines. The Cox-Voinov model is used to describe the\nmoving contact line. A piecewise linear interface method is used to construct\nthe signed distance function and to implement the contact angle boundary\ncondition. Spurious currents are studied in the case of static and moving fluid\ninterfaces, which show convergence behavior. Pressure and the surface tension\nforce are balanced up to machine precision for static parabolic interfaces,\nwhile the velocity error decreases steadily with grid refinement when the\ninterface is advected in a uniform flow field. The moving contact line problem\nis studied and validated through comparison with theory and experiments for an\nadvancing interface and capillary rise in a tube.\n", "  The physics of active systems of self-propelled particles, in the regime of a\ndense liquid state, is an open puzzle of great current interest, both for\nstatistical physics and because such systems appear in many biological\ncontexts. We develop a nonequilibrium mode-coupling theory (MCT) for such\nsystems, where activity is included as a colored noise with the particles\nhaving a self-propulsion foce $f_0$ and persistence time $\\tau_p$. Using the\nextended MCT and a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we calculate\nthe effective temperature $T_{eff}$ of the active fluid. The nonequilibrium\nnature of the systems is manifested through a time-dependent $T_{eff}$ that\napproaches a constant in the long-time limit, which depends on the activity\nparameters $f_0$ and $\\tau_p$. We find, phenomenologically, that this long-time\nlimit is captured by the potential energy of a single, trapped active particle\n(STAP). Through a scaling analysis close to the MCT glass transition point, we\nshow that $\\tau_\\alpha$, the $\\alpha$-relaxation time, behaves as\n$\\tau_\\alpha\\sim f_0^{-2\\gamma}$, where $\\gamma=1.74$ is the MCT exponent for\nthe passive system. $\\tau_\\alpha$ may increase or decrease as a function of\n$\\tau_p$ depending on the type of active force correlations, but the behavior\nis always governed by the same value of the exponent $\\gamma$. Comparison with\nnumerical solution of the nonequilibrium MCT as well as simulation results give\nexcellent agreement with the scaling analysis.\n", "  Binary neutron star mergers are considered to be the most favorable sources\nthat produce electromagnetic (EM) signals associated with gravitational waves\n(GWs). These mergers are the likely progenitors of short duration gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs). The brief gamma-ray emission (the \"prompt GRB\" emission) is\nproduced by ultra-relativistic jets, as a result, this emission is strongly\nbeamed over a small solid angle along the jet. It is estimated to be a decade\nor more before a short GRB jet within the LIGO volume points along our line of\nsight. For this reason, the study of the prompt signal as an EM counterpart to\nGW events has been sparse. We argue that for a realistic jet model, one whose\nluminosity and Lorentz factor vary smoothly with angle, the prompt signal can\nbe detected for a significantly broader range of viewing angles. This can lead\nto a new type of EM counterpart, an \"off-axis\" short GRB. Our estimates and\nsimulations show that it is feasible to detect these signals with the aid of\nthe temporal coincidence from a LIGO trigger, even if the observer is\nsubstantially misaligned with respect to the jet.\n", "  We propose a tensor network method for investigating strongly disordered\nsystems that is based on an adaptation of entanglement renormalization [G.\nVidal, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 220405 (2007)]. This method makes use of the strong\ndisorder renormalization group to determine the order in which lattice sites\nare coarse-grained, which sets the overall structure of the corresponding\ntensor network ansatz, before optimization using variational energy\nminimization. Benchmark results from the disordered XXZ model demonstrates that\nthis approach accurately captures ground state entanglement in disordered\nsystems, even at long distances. This approach leads to a new class of\nefficiently contractible tensor network ansatz for 1D systems, which may be\nunderstood as a generalization of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization\nansatz for disordered systems.\n", "  Let G be a compact Lie group acting on a smooth manifold M. In this paper, we\nconsider Meinrenken's G-equivariant bundle gerbe connections on M as objects in\na 2-groupoid. We prove this 2-category is equivalent to the 2-groupoid of gerbe\nconnections on the differential quotient stack associated to M, and isomorphism\nclasses of G-equivariant gerbe connections are classified by degree three\ndifferential equivariant cohomology. Finally, we consider the existence and\nuniqueness of conjugation-equivariant gerbe connections on compact semisimple\nLie groups.\n", "  The POLAR detector is a space based Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) polarimeter with a\nwide field of view, which covers almost half the sky. The instrument uses\nCompton scattering of gamma rays on a plastic scintillator hodoscope to measure\nthe polarization of the incoming photons. The instrument has been successfully\nlaunched on board of the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong~2 on September 15,\n2016. The construction of the instrument components is described in this\narticle. Details are provided on problems encountered during the construction\nphase and their solutions. Initial performance of the instrument in orbit is as\nexpected from ground tests and Monte Carlo simulation.\n", "  Using images from the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys, we\nmeasure the rate of cooling of white dwarfs in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae\nand compare it to modelled cooling curves. We examine the effects of the outer\nconvective envelope reaching the nearly isothermal degenerate core and the\nrelease of latent heat during core crystallisation on the white dwarf cooling\nrates. For white dwarfs typical of 47 Tuc, the onset of these effects occur at\nsimilar times. The latent heat released during crystallisation is a small heat\nsource. In contrast, the heat reservoir of the degenerate core is substantially\nlarger. When the convective envelope reaches the nearly isothermal interior of\nthe white dwarf, the star becomes brighter than it would be in the absence of\nthis effect. Our modelled cooling curves that include this convective coupling\nclosely match the observed luminosity function of the white dwarfs in 47 Tuc.\n", "  Prior to the origin of simple cellular life, the building blocks of RNA\n(nucleotides) had to form and polymerize in favourable environments on the\nearly Earth. At this time, meteorites and interplanetary dust particles\ndelivered organics such as nucleobases (the characteristic molecules of\nnucleotides) to warm little ponds whose wet-dry cycles promoted rapid\npolymerization. We build a comprehensive numerical model for the evolution of\nnucleobases in warm little ponds leading to the emergence of the first\nnucleotides and RNA. We couple Earth's early evolution with complex prebiotic\nchemistry in these environments. We find that RNA polymers must have emerged\nvery quickly after the deposition of meteorites (< a few years). Their\nconstituent nucleobases were primarily meteoritic in origin and not from\ninterplanetary dust particles. Ponds appeared as continents rose out of the\nearly global ocean but this increasing availability of \"targets\" for meteorites\nwas offset by declining meteorite bombardment rates. Moreover, the rapid losses\nof nucleobases to pond seepage during wet periods, and to UV photodissociation\nduring dry periods means that the synthesis of nucleotides and their\npolymerization into RNA occurred in just one to a few wet-dry cycles. Under\nthese conditions, RNA polymers likely appeared prior to 4.17 billion years ago.\n  Significance: There are two competing hypotheses for the site at which an RNA\nworld emerged: hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean and warm little ponds.\nBecause the former lacks wet and dry cycles, which are well known to promote\npolymerization (in this case, of nucleotides into RNA), we construct a\ncomprehensive model for the origin of RNA in the latter sites. Our model\nadvances the story and timeline of the RNA world by constraining the source of\nbiomolecules, the environmental conditions, the timescales of reaction, and the\nemergence of first RNA polymers.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers (MLs) exhibit rich\nphotoluminescence spectra associated with interband optical transitions of\ndirect-gap semiconductors. Upon absorption of photons, direct excitons with\nzero center-of-mass momentum are formed by photo-excited electrons in the\nconduction band and the respective unoccupied states in the valence band of the\nsame valley. Different spin configurations of such momentum-direct excitons as\nwell as their charged counterparts provide a powerful platform for spin-valley\nand microcavity physics in two-dimensional materials. The corresponding\nspectral signatures, however, are insufficient to explain the main\ncharacteristic peaks observed in the photoluminescence spectra of ML TMDs on\nthe basis of momentum-\\textit{direct} excitons alone. Here, we show that the\nnotion of momentum-\\textit{indirect} excitons is important for the\nunderstanding of the versatile photoluminescence features. Taking into account\nphonon-assisted radiative recombination pathways for electrons and holes from\ndissimilar valleys, we interpret unidentified peaks in the emission spectra as\nacoustic and optical phonon sidebands of momentum-dark excitons. Our approach\nwill facilitate the interpretation of optical, valley and spin phenomena in\nTMDs arising from bright and dark exciton manifolds.\n", "  Monolayer (ML) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) integrated in optical\nmicrocavities host exciton-polaritons as a hallmark of the strong light-matter\ncoupling regime. Analogous concepts for hybrid light-matter systems employing\nspatially indirect excitons with a permanent electric dipole moment in\nheterobilayer (HBL) crystals promise realizations of exciton-polariton gases\nand condensates with immanent dipolar interactions. Here, we identify optical\nsignatures of spatially indirect momentum-bright and momentum-dark interlayer\nexcitons in vertical MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ heterostructures and implement\ncavity-control of both exciton manifolds. Our experiments quantify the strength\nof light-matter coupling for both zero and finite momentum excitons residing in\nMoir\\'{e} superlattices of TMD HBLs and demonstrate that both exciton species\nare susceptible to Purcell enhancement in cavity-modified photonic\nenvironments. Our results form the basis for further developments of dipolar\nexciton-polariton gases and condensates in hybrid cavity -- van der Waals\nheterostructure systems.\n", "  We consider a delay differential equation (DDE) model for mode-locked\noperation in class-A semiconductor lasers containing both gain and absorber\nsections. The material processes are adiabatically eliminated as these are\nconsidered fast in comparison to the delay time for a long cavity device. We\ndetermine the steady states and analyze their bifurcations using DDE-BIFTOOL\n[K. Engelborghs, T. Luzyanina, and D. Roose, ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 28, 1\n(2002)]. Multiple forms of coexistence, transformation and hysteretic behavior\nof stable steady states and fundamental periodic regimes are discussed in\nbifurcation diagrams.\n", "  I report new, world-leading LHCb results on heavy meson lifetimes. We use a\nnovel approach that suppresses the shortcomings typically associated with\nreconstruction of semileptonic decays, allowing for precise measurements of\nlifetimes and other properties in collider experiments. We achieve a 15% and a\n$2\\times$ improvement over current best determinations of the flavor-specific\n$B^0_s$ lifetime and $D^-_s$ lifetime, respectively.\n", "  We construct a Hamiltonian whose dynamics simulate the dynamics of every\nother Hamiltonian up to exponentially long times in the system size. The\nHamiltonian is time-independent, local, one-dimensional, and translation\ninvariant. As a consequence, we show (under plausible computational complexity\nassumptions) that the circuit complexity of the unitary dynamics under this\nHamiltonian grows steadily with time up to an exponential value in system size.\nThis result makes progress on a recent conjecture by Susskind, in the context\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence, that the time evolution of the thermofield\ndouble state of two conformal fields theories with a holographic dual has a\ncircuit complexity increasing linearly in time, up to exponential time.\n", "  We study uniaxial solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations for a Landau-de\nGennes free energy for nematic liquid crystals, with a fourth order bulk\npotential, with and without elastic anisotropy. In the elastic isotropic case,\nwe show that (i) all uniaxial solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations, with a\ndirector field of certain symmetry, necessarily have the radial-hedgehog\nstructure modulo an orthogonal transformation, (ii) the \"escape into third\ndimension\" director cannot correspond to a purely uniaxial solution of the\nLandau-de Gennes Euler-Lagrange equations and we do not use artificial\nassumptions on the scalar order parameter and (iii) there are no non-trivial\nuniaxial solutions that have $\\mathbf{e}_z$ as an eigenvector. In the elastic\nanisotropic case, we prove that all uniaxial solutions of the corresponding\nEuler-Lagrange equations, with a certain symmetry, are strictly of the\nradial-hedgehog type, i.e. the elastic anisotropic case enforces the\nradial-hedgehog structure (or the degree $+1$-vortex structure) more strongly\nthan the elastic isotropic case and the associated partial differential\nequations are technically far more difficult than in the elastic isotropic\ncase.\n", "  We formulate rigorous criteria for selecting diagrams to be taken into\naccount in the analysis of potential polyquark (tetra or penta) poles in QCD.\nThe central point of these criteria is the requirement that the Feynman\ndiagrams for the relevant Green functions contain four-quark (or, respectively,\nfive-quark in the pentaquark case) intermediate states and the corresponding\ncuts. It is shown that some diagrams which \"visually\" seem to contain the\nfour-quark cuts, turn out to be free of these singularities and therefore\nshould not be taken into account when calculating the tetraquark properties. We\nthen consider large-$N_c$ QCD which in many cases provide qualitatively correct\npicture of hadron properties and discuss in detail the tetraquark states. For\nthe \"direct\" and the \"recombination\" four-point Green functions, which may\npotentially contain the tetraquark poles, we formulate large-$N_c$ consistency\nconditions which strongly restrict the behaviour of the tetraquark-to-ordinary\nmeson transition amplitudes. In the end, these conditions allow us to obtain\nconstraints on width of the potential tetraquark states at large $N_c$. We\nreport that both flavor-exotic and cryptoexotic (i.e., flavor-nonexotic)\ntetraquarks, if the corresponding poles exist, have a width of order\n$O(1/N_c^2)$, i.e. they should be parametrically narrower compared to the\nordinary $\\bar qq$ mesons with a width of order $O(1/N_c)$. Moreover, for\nflavor-exotic states, the large-$N_c$ consistency conditions require two narrow\nflavor-exotic states, each of these states coupling dominantly to one specific\nmeson-meson channel.\n", "  We present a comprehensive Monte Carlo study of domain growth in the\nrandom-bond XY model with non-conserved kinetics. The presence of quenched\ndisorder slows down domain growth in d = 2; 3. In d = 2, we observe power-law\ngrowth with a disorder-dependent exponent on the time-scales of our simulation.\nIn d = 3, we see the signature of an asymptotically logarithmic growth regime.\nThe scaling functions for the real-space correlation function are seen to be\nindependent of the disorder. However, the same does not apply for the two-time\nautocorrelation function, demonstrating the breakdown of superuniversality.\n", "  It is shown that using Carter leak-off is an oversimplification that leads to\nsignificant errors in the interpretation of DFIT data. Most importantly, this\narticle reveals that previous methods of estimating minimum in-situ stress\noften lead to significant over or underestimates. Based on our modeling and\nsimulation results, we propose a much more accurate and reliable method to\nestimate the minimum in-situ stress and fracture pressure dependent leak-off\nrate.\n", "  The GooFit package provides physicists a simple, familiar syntax for\nmanipulating probability density functions and performing fits, and is highly\noptimized for data analysis on NVIDIA GPUs and multithreaded CPU backends.\nGooFit was updated to version 2.0, bringing a host of new features. A\ncompletely revamped and redesigned build system makes GooFit easier to install,\ndevelop with, and run on virtually any system. Unit testing, continuous\nintegration, and advanced logging options are improving the stability and\nreliability of the system. Developing new PDFs now uses standard CUDA\nterminology and provides a lower barrier for new users. The system now has\nbuilt-in support for multiple graphics cards or nodes using MPI, and is being\ntested on a wide range of different systems. GooFit also has significant\nimprovements in performance on some GPU architectures due to optimized memory\naccess. Support for time-dependent four-body amplitude analyses has also been\nadded.\n", "  Today digital sources supply an unprecedented component of human sensorimotor\ndata, the consumption of which is correlated with poorly understood maladies\nsuch as Internet Addiction Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder. This paper\noffers a mathematical understanding of human sensorimotor processing as\nmultiscale, continuous-time vibratory interaction. We quantify human\ninformational needs using the signal processing metrics of entropy, noise,\ndimensionality, continuity, latency, and bandwidth. Using these metrics, we\ndefine the trust humans experience as a primitive statistical algorithm\nprocessing finely grained sensorimotor data from neuromechanical interaction.\nThis definition of neuromechanical trust implies that artificial sensorimotor\ninputs and interactions that attract low-level attention through frequent\ndiscontinuities and enhanced coherence will decalibrate a brain's\nrepresentation of its world over the long term by violating the implicit\nstatistical contract for which self-calibration evolved. This approach allows\nus to model addiction in general as the result of homeostatic regulation gone\nawry in novel environments and digital dependency as a sub-case in which the\ndecalibration caused by digital sensorimotor data spurs yet more consumption of\nthem. We predict that institutions can use these sensorimotor metrics to\nquantify media richness to improve employee well-being; that dyads and\nfamily-size groups will bond and heal best through low-latency, high-resolution\nmultisensory interaction such as shared meals and reciprocated touch; and that\nindividuals can improve sensory and sociosensory resolution through deliberate\nsensory reintegration practices. We conclude that we humans are the victims of\nour own success, our hands so skilled they fill the world with captivating\nthings, our eyes so innocent they follow eagerly.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors provide a unique opportunity for\noptoelectronics due to their layered atomic structure, electronic and optical\nproperties. To date, a majority of the application-oriented research in this\nfield has been focused on field-effect electronics as well as photodetectors\nand light emitting diodes. Here we present a perspective on the use of 2D\nsemiconductors for photovoltaic applications. We discuss photonic device\ndesigns that enable light trapping in nanometer-thickness absorber layers, and\nwe also outline schemes for efficient carrier transport and collection. We\nfurther provide theoretical estimates of efficiency indicating that 2D\nsemiconductors can indeed be competitive with and complementary to conventional\nphotovoltaics, based on favorable energy bandgap, absorption, external\nradiative efficiency, along with recent experimental demonstrations. Photonic\nand electronic design of 2D semiconductor photovoltaics represents a new\ndirection for realizing ultrathin, efficient solar cells with applications\nranging from conventional power generation to portable and ultralight solar\npower.\n", "  The ESA Gaia satellite scans the whole sky with a temporal sampling ranging\nfrom seconds and hours to months. Each time a source passes within the Gaia\nfield of view, it moves over 10 CCDs in 45 s and a lightcurve with 4.5 s\nsampling (the crossing time per CCD) is registered. Given that the 4.5 s\nsampling represents a virtually unexplored parameter space in optical time\ndomain astronomy, this data set potentially provides a unique opportunity to\nopen up the fast transient sky. We present a method to start mining the wealth\nof information in the per CCD Gaia data. We perform extensive data filtering to\neliminate known on-board and data processing artefacts, and present a\nstatistical method to identify sources that show transient brightness\nvariations on ~2 hours timescales. We illustrate that by using the Gaia\nphotometric CCD measurements, we can detect transient brightness variations\ndown to an amplitude of 0.3 mag on timescales ranging from 15 seconds to\nseveral hours. We search an area of ~23.5 square degrees on the sky, and find\nfour strong candidate fast transients. Two candidates are tentatively\nclassified as flares on M-dwarf stars, while one is probably a flare on a giant\nstar and one potentially a flare on a solar type star. These classifications\nare based on archival data and the timescales involved. We argue that the\nmethod presented here can be added to the existing Gaia Science Alerts\ninfrastructure for the near real-time public dissemination of fast transient\nevents.\n", "  The first successful theory of superconductivity was the one proposed by\nBardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer in 1957. This breakthrough fostered a remarkable\ngrowth of the field that propitiated progress and questionings, generating\nalternative theories to explain specific phenomena. For example, it has been\nargued that Bismuth, being a semimetal with a low number of carriers, does not\ncomply with the basic hypotheses underlying BCS and therefore a different\napproach should be considered. Nevertheless, in 2016 based on BCS we put forth\na prediction that Bi at ambient pressure becomes a superconductor at 1.3 mK\n[1]. A year later an experimental group corroborated that in fact Bi is a\nsuperconductor with a transition temperature of 0.53 mK [2], a result that\neluded previous work. So, since Bi is superconductive in almost all the\ndifferent structures and phases, the question is why Bi-IV has been elusive and\nhas not been found yet to superconduct? Here we present a study of the\nelectronic and vibrational properties of Bi-IV and infer its possible\nsuperconductivity using a BCS approach. We predict that if the Bi-IV phase\nstructure were cooled down to liquid helium temperatures it would also\nsuperconduct at a Tc of 4.25 K.\n", "  Kondo insulator samarium hexaboride (SmB6) has been intensely studied in\nrecent years as a potential candidate of a strongly correlated topological\ninsulator. One of the most exciting phenomena observed in SmB6 is the clear\nquantum oscillations appearing in magnetic torque at a low temperature despite\nthe insulating behavior in resistance. These quantum oscillations show multiple\nfrequencies and varied effective masses. The origin of quantum oscillation is,\nhowever, still under debate with evidence of both two-dimensional Fermi\nsurfaces and three-dimensional Fermi surfaces. Here, we carry out\nangle-resolved torque magnetometry measurements in a magnetic field up to 45 T\nand a temperature range down to 40 mK. With the magnetic field rotated in the\n(010) plane, the quantum oscillation frequency of the strongest oscillation\nbranch shows a four-fold rotational symmetry. However, in the angular\ndependence of the amplitude of the same branch, this four-fold symmetry is\nbroken and, instead, a twofold symmetry shows up, which is consistent with the\nprediction of a two-dimensional Lifshitz-Kosevich model. No deviation of\nLifshitz-Kosevich behavior is observed down to 40 mK. Our results suggest the\nexistence of multiple light-mass surface states in SmB6, with their mobility\nsignificantly depending on the surface disorder level.\n", "  Glasma Flux Tubes, Mono Jets with squeeze out flow around them plus the\nChiral Magnetic Effect(CME) are physical phenomenon that generate two particle\ncorrelation with respect to the reaction plane in mid-central 20\\% to 30\\%\nAu-Au collision $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200.0 GeV measured at RHIC.\n", "  DUNE is an international project, currently in its design phase, for neutrino\nphysics and proton-decay searches. It will consist of two detectors exposed to\na megawatt-scale muon neutrino beam that will be produced at Fermilab\n(Illinois, USA). One detector will record particle interactions near the source\nof the beam, while a second, much larger, detector comprising four 10-kilotonne\nliquid argon TPCs will be installed at a depth of 1.5 km at SURF (South Dakota,\nUSA), about 1300 kilometres away of the neutrino source. Among the primary\nscientific goals of DUNE is the precision measurement of the parameters that\ngovern neutrino mixing, including those still unknown: the octant in which the\n$\\theta_{23}$ mixing angle lies, the neutrino mass ordering and the value of\nthe CP violation phase. This paper discusses the sensitivity of the DUNE\nexperiment to these parameters.\n", "  Although interstellar grains are known to be aspherical, their actual shapes\nremain poorly constrained. We assess whether three distributions of ellipsoidal\nshapes from the literature, employed principally for their convenient\nmathematical properties, are suitable for describing the shapes of interstellar\ngrains. Randomly-selected shapes from each distribution are shown as\nillustrations. The often-used BHCDE distribution includes a very large fraction\nof extreme shapes: fully 10% of random draws have axial ratio a_3/a_1 > 19.7,\nand 5% have a_3/a_1 > 33. Of the three distributions considered, the CDE2\nappears to be most realistic. For each of the three CDEs considered, we derive\nshape-averaged cross sections for extinction and polarization. Finally, we\ndescribe a method for \"synthesizing\" a dielectric function for an assumed shape\nor shape distribution if the actual absorption cross sections per grain volume\nare known from observations. This synthetic dielectric function predicts the\nwavelength dependence of polarization, which can then be compared to\nobservations to constrain the grain shape.\n", "  We report a gas eruption phenomenon caused by electrolysis of liquid Ga-In\nalloy in an electrolyte, especially NaOH solution. A volcanic eruption-like\nblowout of gas occurred from the orifice on the alloy surface. In addition to\ngas plume, large gas bubbles were also generated and the total gas yield\nincreased as In ratio was increased. It is found that destructiveness of the\npassivation layer on the Ga-In alloy is critical to gas generation. The\nmechanism of gas eruption can be ascribed to a galvanic interaction happens\nowing to passivation film and alloy with different activity connected as\nelectrode in electrolyte. Further investigation demonstrated that the lattice\nof the film expands because of the incorporation of indium, which brings about\nthe decrease in band gap and finally enhances more gas generation. These\nfindings regain the basic understanding of room temperature liquid metal inside\nelectrolyte.\n", "  Using spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements on GaP$_{1-x}$Bi$_{x}$/GaP\nepitaxial layers up to $x = 3.7$% we observe a giant bowing of the direct band\ngap ($E_{g}^{\\Gamma}$) and valence band spin-orbit splitting energy\n($\\Delta_{\\textrm{SO}}$). $E_{g}^{\\Gamma}$ ($\\Delta_{\\textrm{SO}}$) is measured\nto decrease (increase) by approximately 200 meV (240 meV) with the\nincorporation of 1% Bi, corresponding to a greater than fourfold increase in\n$\\Delta_{\\textrm{SO}}$ in going from GaP to GaP$_{0.99}$Bi$_{0.01}$. The\nevolution of $E_{g}^{\\Gamma}$ and $\\Delta_{\\textrm{SO}}$ with $x$ is\ncharacterised by strong, composition-dependent bowing. We demonstrate that a\nsimple valence band-anticrossing model, parametrised directly from atomistic\nsupercell calculations, quantitatively describes the measured evolution of\n$E_{g}^{\\Gamma}$ and $\\Delta_{\\textrm{SO}}$ with $x$. In contrast to the\nwell-studied GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_{x}$ alloy, in GaP$_{1-x}$Bi$_{x}$ substitutional\nBi creates localised impurity states lying energetically within the GaP host\nmatrix band gap. This leads to the emergence of an optically active band of\nBi-hybridised states, accounting for the overall large bowing of\n$E_{g}^{\\Gamma}$ and $\\Delta_{\\textrm{SO}}$ and in particular for the giant\nbowing observed for $x \\lesssim 1$%. Our analysis provides insight into the\naction of Bi as an isovalent impurity, and constitutes the first detailed\nexperimental and theoretical analysis of the GaP$_{1-x}$Bi$_{x}$ alloy band\nstructure.\n", "  We describe the road which led to the construction and exploitation of\nelectron positron colliders, hightlighting how the young physics student Bruno\nTouschek met the Norwegian engineer Rolf Wideroe in Germany, during WWII, and\ncollaborated in building the 15 MeV betatron, a secret project directed by\nWideroe and financed by the Ministry of Aviation of the Reich. This is how\nBruno Touschek learnt the science of making particle accelerators and was\nready, many years later, to propose and build AdA, the first electron positron\ncollider, in Frascati, Italy, in 1960. We shall then see how AdA was brought\nfrom Frascati to Orsay, in France. Taking advantage of the Orsay Linear\nAccelerator as injector, the Franco-Italian team was able to prove that\ncollisions had taken place, opening the way to the use of particle colliders as\na mean to explore high energy physics.\n", "  Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) can be thought of as quantum\nprobabilistic graphical models that can model sequential data. We extend\nprevious work on HQMMs with three contributions: (1) we show how classical\nhidden Markov models (HMMs) can be simulated on a quantum circuit, (2) we\nreformulate HQMMs by relaxing the constraints for modeling HMMs on quantum\ncircuits, and (3) we present a learning algorithm to estimate the parameters of\nan HQMM from data. While our algorithm requires further optimization to handle\nlarger datasets, we are able to evaluate our algorithm using several synthetic\ndatasets. We show that on HQMM generated data, our algorithm learns HQMMs with\nthe same number of hidden states and predictive accuracy as the true HQMMs,\nwhile HMMs learned with the Baum-Welch algorithm require more states to match\nthe predictive accuracy.\n", "  Conjunctivochalasis is a common cause of tear dysfunction due to the\nconjunctiva becoming loose and wrinkly with age. The current solutions to this\ndisease include either surgical excision in the operating room, or\nthermoreduction of the loose tissue with hot wire in the clinic. We developed a\nnear-infrared (NIR) laser thermal conjunctivoplasty (LTC) system, which gently\nshrinks the redundant tissue. The NIR light is mainly absorbed by water, so the\nheating is even and there is no bleeding. The system utilizes a 1460-nm\nprogrammable laser diode system as a light source. A miniaturized handheld\nprobe delivers the laser light and focuses the laser into a 10x1 mm2 line. A\nfoot pedal is used to deliver a preset number of calibrated laser pulses. A\nfold of loose conjunctiva is grasped by a pair of forceps. The infrared laser\nlight is delivered through an optical fiber and a laser line is focused exactly\non the conjunctival fold by a cylindrical lens. Ex vivo experiments using\nporcine eye were performed with the optimal laser parameters. It was found that\nup to 50% of conjunctiva shrinkage could be achieved.\n", "  The discovery of new families of exfoliatable 2D crystals that have diverse\nsets of electronic, optical, and spin-orbit coupling properties, enables the\nrealization of unique physical phenomena in these few-atom thick building\nblocks and in proximity to other materials. Herein, using NaSn2As2 as a model\nsystem, we demonstrate that layered Zintl phases having the stoichiometry\nATt2Pn2 (A = Group 1 or 2 element, Tt = Group 14 tetrel element and Pn = Group\n15 pnictogen element) and feature networks separated by van der Waals gaps can\nbe readily exfoliated with both mechanical and liquid-phase methods. We\nidentified the symmetries of the Raman active modes of the bulk crystals via\npolarized Raman spectroscopy. The bulk and mechanically exfoliated NaSn2As2\nsamples are resistant towards oxidation, with only the top surface oxidizing in\nambient conditions over a couple of days, while the liquid-exfoliated samples\noxidize much more quickly in ambient conditions. Employing angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), density functional theory (DFT), and\ntransport on bulk and exfoliated samples, we show that NaSn2As2 is a highly\nconducting 2D semimetal, with resistivities on the order of 10-6 {\\Omega} m.\nDue to peculiarities in the band structure, the dominating p-type carriers at\nlow temperature are nearly compensated by the opening of n-type conduction\nchannels as temperature increases. This work further expands the family of\nexfoliatable 2D materials to layered van der Waals Zintl phases, opening up\nopportunities in electronics and spintronics.\n", "  We study a neuro-inspired model that mimics a discussion (or information\ndissemination) process in a network of agents. During their interaction, agents\nredistribute activity and network weights, resulting in emergence of leader(s).\nThe model is able to reproduce the basic scenarios of leadership known in\nnature and society: laissez-faire (irregular activity, weak leadership, sizable\ninter-follower interaction, autonomous sub-leaders); participative or\ndemocratic (strong leadership, but with feedback from followers); and\nautocratic (no feedback, one-way influence). Several pertinent aspects of these\nscenarios are found as well---e.g., hidden leadership (a hidden clique of\nagents driving the official autocratic leader), and successive leadership (two\nleaders influence followers by turns). We study how these scenarios emerge from\ninter-agent dynamics and how they depend on behavior rules of agents---in\nparticular, on their inertia against state changes.\n", "  The question of how mechanically-gated membrane channels open and close is\nnotoriously difficult to address, especially if the protein structure is not\navailable. This perspective highlights the relevance of micropipette-aspirated\nsingle-particle tracking--- used to obtain a channel's diffusion coefficient,\n$D$, as a function of applied membrane tension, $\\sigma$--- as an indirect\nassay for determining functional behaviour in mechanosensitive channels. Whilst\nensuring that the protein remains integral to the membrane, such methods can be\nused to identify not only the gating mechanism of a protein, but also\nassociated physical moduli, such as torsional- and dilational-rigidity, which\ncorrespond to the protein's effective shape change. As an example, three\ndistinct $D$ versus $\\sigma$ \"signatures\" are calculated, corresponding to\ngating by dilation, gating by tilt, and a combination of both dilation and\ntilt. Both advantages and disadvantages of the approach are discussed.\n", "  The center of mass dynamics of cold atoms and the Bose-Einstein condensate in\none dimensional optical lattice is considered both in the absence and in the\npresence of external forcing. We discuss three situations for matter waves:\nfirst, the cold atoms; second, sufficiently dilute condensate where the\ndynamics are governed by the single particle wave packet dynamics; third,\nstrong interaction regime, where, inter-atomic interaction can no longer be\nignored. The analytical formalism developed for the two regimes, namely, deep\noptical lattice and shallow optical lattice. Parametric dependencies of energy\nspectrum and classical period, revival time and super revival are explained for\nthe two regimes.\n  The dynamics of condensate in driven optical lattice crystal are analyzed by\nstudying dynamical stability of the condensate. The stability is determined by\nthe dispersion behavior of the condensate excited in driven optical lattice.\nThe recurrence behavior of the condensate close to the nonlinear resonances is\nanalyzed as a function of time for delicate recurrences which take place for\ninstance when lattice is weakly perturbed and robust recurrences which may\nmanifest themselves for sufficiently strong external driving force.\n  The analysis is not only valid for dilute condensate but also applicable for\nstrongly interacting homogeneous condensate provided, the external modulation\ncauses no significant change in density profile of the condensate. We explain\nparametric dependence of the dynamical recurrence times which can easily be\nrealized in laboratory experiments. In addition, we find a good agreement\nbetween the obtained analytical results and numerical calculations. The\nstability of condensate is also explored in driven optical lattice numerically.\n", "  Impurity bound states and quasi-particle scattering from these can serve as\nsensitive probes for identifying the pairing state of a superconducting\ncondensate. We introduce and discuss defect bound state quasi-particle\ninterference (DBS-QPI) imaging as a tool to extract information about the\nsymmetry of the order parameter from spatial maps of the density of states\naround magnetic and non-magnetic impurities. We show that the phase information\ncontained in the scattering patterns around impurities can provide valuable\ninformation beyond what is obtained through conventional QPI imaging. Keeping\ntrack of phase, rather than just magnitudes, in the Fourier transforms is\nachieved through phase-referenced Fourier transforms that preserve both real\nand imaginary parts of the QPI images. We further compare DBS-QPI to other\napproaches which have been proposed to use either QPI or defect scattering to\ndistinguish different symmetries of the order parameter.\n", "  The superconducting order parameter is directly related to the pairing\ninteraction, with the amplitude determined by the interaction strength, while\nthe phase reflects the spatial structure of the interaction. However, given the\nlarge variety of materials and their rich physical properties within the\niron-based high-Tc superconductors, the structure of the order parameter\nremains controversial in many cases. Here, we introduce Defect Bound State\nQuasi Particle Interference (DBS-QPI) as a new method to determine the\nsuperconducting order parameter. Using a low-temperature scanning tunneling\nmicroscope, we image in-gap bound states in the stoichiometric iron-based\nsuperconductor LiFeAs and show that the bound states induced by defect\nscattering are formed from Bogoliubov quasiparticles that have significant\nspatial extent. Quasiparticle interference from these bound states has unique\nsignatures from which one can determine the phase of the order parameter as\nwell as the nature of the defect, i.e. whether it is better described as a\nmagnetic vs a nonmagnetic scatterer. DBS-QPI provides an easy but general\nmethod to characterize the pairing symmetry of superconducting condensates.\n", "  Electromagnetic response of PT-dipole is studied both analytically and\nnumerically. In analytical approach, dipole is represented by two point\nscatterers. Within the first Born approximation, the asymmetry of the\nscattering field with respect to the orientation of dipole is proven. In\nnumerical simulations, dipole is represented by two infinitely long, parallel\ncylinders with opposite sign of imaginary part of refractive index. Numerical\ndata confirm the validity of the Born approximation in the weak scattering\nlimit, while significant deviations from the Born approximation were observed\nfor stronger scatterers and in the near-field range.\n", "  Quantum tunneling effect has been an important issue in both fundamental\nscience and practical applications. Classical quantum tunneling devices are\ngenerally rigid in structures which may encounter technical difficulties during\nfabrication, functional tuning and shape adapting. Here through introducing the\nroom-temperature liquid metals as two conductive electrodes and a soft even\nliquid insulating layer sandwiched between them, we proposed a conceptually\ninnovative all-soft or liquid quantum device which would help realize a couple\nof unconventional quantum capabilities such as flexibility, deformability,\ntransformability, and reconfigurability, etc. which may not be easily offered\nby a rigid quantum device. Representative structural configurations to make\nsuch transformable quantum devices via sandwiching various liquid\nmetal-insulating layer-liquid metal (LM-IL-LM) components are suggested. The\nfeasibility for making such an all-soft quantum device is interpreted through\nexperimental evidences and theoretical evaluations. Potential future\napplications of the proposed devices in a group of emerging fields including\nintelligent quantum systems and quantum computing are prospected.\n", "  Despite the progress in high performance computing, Computational Fluid\nDynamics (CFD) simulations are still computationally expensive for many\npractical engineering applications such as simulating large computational\ndomains and highly turbulent flows. One of the major reasons of the high\nexpense of CFD is the need for a fine grid to resolve phenomena at the relevant\nscale, and obtain a grid-independent solution. The fine grid requirements often\ndrive the computational time step size down, which makes long transient\nproblems prohibitively expensive. In the research presented, the feasibility of\na Coarse Grid CFD (CG-CFD) approach is investigated by utilizing Machine\nLearning (ML) algorithms. Relying on coarse grids increases the discretization\nerror. Hence, a method is suggested to produce a surrogate model that predicts\nthe CG-CFD local errors to correct the variables of interest. Given\nhigh-fidelity data, a surrogate model is trained to predict the CG-CFD local\nerrors as a function of the coarse grid local features. ML regression\nalgorithms are utilized to construct a surrogate model that relates the local\nerror and the coarse grid features. This method is applied to a\nthree-dimensional flow in a lid driven cubic cavity domain. The performance of\nthe method was assessed by training the surrogate model on the flow full field\nspatial data and tested on new data (from flows of different Reynolds number\nand/or computed by different grid sizes). The proposed method maximizes the\nbenefit of the available data and shows potential for a good predictive\ncapability.\n", "  We present a lattice gas model that without fine tuning of parameters is\nexpected to exhibit the so far elusive modified Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)\nuniversality class. To this end, we review briefly how non-linear fluctuating\nhydrodynamics in one dimension predicts that all dynamical universality classes\nin its range of applicability belong to an infinite discrete family which we\ncall Fibonacci family since their dynamical exponents are the Kepler ratios\n$z_i = F_{i+1}/F_{i}$ of neighbouring Fibonacci numbers $F_i$, including\ndiffusion ($z_2=2$), KPZ ($z_3=3/2$), and the limiting ratio which is the\ngolden mean $z_\\infty=(1+\\sqrt{5})/2$. Then we revisit the case of two\nconservation laws to which the modified KPZ model belongs. We also derive\ncriteria on the macroscopic currents to lead to other non-KPZ universality\nclasses.\n", "  The self-assembly of submerged cold-plasma-treated polyethylene beads is\nreported. The plasma-treated immersed millimetrically-sized polyethylene beads\nformed well-ordered 2D quasi-crystalline structures. The submerged floating of\nlight polyethylene beads is possible due to the energy gain achieved by the\nwetting of the high-energy plasma-treated polymer surface prevailing over the\nenergy loss due to the upward climb of the liquid over the beads. The capillary\nimmersion attraction force is responsible for the observed self-assembly. The\nobserved 2D quasi-crystalline structures demonstrate dislocations and point\ndefects. Mechanical vibration of self-assembled rafts built of polyethylene\nbeads leads to the healing of point defects. The immersion capillary lateral\nforce governs the self-assembly, whereas the elastic force is responsible for\nthe repulsion of polymer beads.\n", "  The self-propelled, longstanding rotation of the polymer tubing containing\ncamphor continuing for dozens of hours is reported. The rotator is driven by\nthe solutocapillary Marangoni flows owing to the dissolution of camphor. The\nphenomenological model of self-propulsion is suggested and verified. Scaling\nlaws describing the quasi-stationary self-propulsion are proposed and tested\nexperimentally. The change in the surface tension, arising from the dissolution\nof camphor and driving the rotator is estimated as 0.3 mN/m.\n", "  The self-propulsion of a heavy, superoleophobic, metallic micro-boat carrying\na droplet of various aqueous alcohol solutions as a fuel tank is reported. The\nmicro boat is driven by the solutocapillary Marangoni flow. The jump in the\nsurface tension owing to the condensation of alcohols on the water surface was\nestablished experimentally. Maximal velocities of the self-propulsion were\nregistered as high as 0.05 m/s. The maximal velocity of the center mass of the\nboat correlates with the maximal change in the surface tension, due to the\ncondensation of alcohols. The mechanism of the self-locomotion is discussed.\nThe phenomenological dynamic model describing the self-propulsion is reported.\n", "  Our present relativistic part of the geodetic VLBI model for Earthbound\nantennas is a consensus model which is considered as a standard for processing\nhigh-precision VLBI observations. It was created as a compromise between a\nvariety of relativistic VLBI models proposed by different authors as documented\nin the IERS Conventions 2010. The accuracy of the consensus model is in the\npicosecond range for the group delay but this is not sufficient for current\ngeodetic pur- poses. This paper provides a fully documented derivation of a new\nrelativistic model having an accuracy substantially higher than one picosecond\nand based upon a well accepted formalism of relativistic celestial mechanics,\nastrometry and geodesy. Our new model fully confirms the consensus model at the\npicosecond level and in several respects goes to a great extent beyond it. More\nspecifically, terms related to the acceleration of the geocenter are considered\nand kept in the model, the gravitational time-delay due to a massive body\n(planet, Sun, etc.) with arbitrary mass and spin-multipole moments is derived\ntaking into account the motion of the body, and a new formalism for the\ntime-delay problem of radio sources located at finite distance from VLBI\nstations is presented. Thus, the paper presents a substantially elaborated\ntheoretical justification of the consensus model and its significant extension\nthat allows researchers to make concrete estimates of the magnitude of residual\nterms of this model for any conceivable configuration of the source of light,\nmassive bodies, and VLBI stations. The largest terms in the relativistic time\ndelay which can affect the current VLBI observations are from the quadrupole\nand the angular momentum of the gravitating bodies that are known from the\nliterature. These terms should be included in the new geodetic VLBI model for\nimproving its consistency.\n", "  KERN is a bi-annually released set of radio astronomical software packages.\nIt should contain most of the standard tools that a radio astronomer needs to\nwork with radio telescope data. The goal of KERN is to save time and prevent\nfrustration in setting up of scientific pipelines, and to assist in achieving\nscientific reproducibility.\n", "  A micro-boat self-propelled by a camphor engine, carrying seed crystals of\nFeCl3, promoted the evolution of chemical gardens when placed on the surface of\naqueous solutions of potassium hexacyanoferrate. Inverse chemical gardens\n(growing from the top downward) were observed. The growth of the inverse\nchemical gardens was slowed down with an increase in the concentration of the\npotassium hexacyanoferrate. Heliciform precipitates were formed under the\nself-propulsion of the micro-boat. A phenomenological model, satisfactorily\ndescribing the self locomotion of the camphor-driven micro-boat, is introduced\nand checked.\n", "  In this work, we analyse all existing data related to the number of incomers\nand outcomers (who actually obtain the degree) of the following courses offered\nat the Federal University of Santa Catarina: physics teaching, bachelor in\nphysics, master of sciences in physics and doctorate in physics, corresponding\nto the 1998-2017 period, according to their availability. The data point\ntowards a great male predominance (larger than 76%) and a huge evasion of both\nsexes (in average, less than 20% of the undergraduate incomers obtain the\ndegree), the evasion being lower in the postgraduate courses and always\nslightly higher for women.\n  The average number of incomers and outcomers per year decreases as the\nstudents advance from graduate to postgraduate courses, although many students\nin the postgraduate courses come from other institutions. The proportion of\nwomen decreases as the carrier advances.\n  The results indicate the need of complementary studies that can help the\nidentification of the causes of such a high evasion in order to minimize them.\n", "  Textured VO2(011) microcrystals are grown in the monoclinic, M1 phase which\nundergo a reversible first order semiconductor to metal transition (SMT)\naccompanied by a structural phase transition to rutile tetragonal, R phase.\nAround the phase transition, VO2 also experiences noticeable change in its\noptical and electrical properties. A change in color of the VO2 micro crystals\nfrom white to cyan around the transition temperature is observed, which is\nfurther understood by absorption of red light using temperature dependent\nultraviolet-visible spectroscopic analysis and photoluminescence studies. The\nabsorption of light in the red region is explained by the optical transition\nbetween Hubbard states, confirming the electronic correlation as the driving\nforce for SMT in VO2. The thermochromism in VO2 has been studied for smart\nwindow applications so far in the IR region, which supports the opening of the\nband gap in semiconducting phase; whereas there is hardly any report in the\nmanagement of visible light. The filtering of blue light along with reflection\nof infrared above the semiconductor to metal transition temperature make VO2\napplicable as advanced smart windows for overall heat management of a closure.\n", "  A temperature (T)-dependent coarse-grained (CG) Hamiltonian of polyethylene\nglycol/oxide (PEG/PEO) in aqueous solution is reported to be used in\nimplicit-solvent material models in a wide temperature (i.e., solvent quality)\nrange. The T-dependent nonbonded CG interactions are derived from a combined\n\"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" approach. The pair potentials calculated from\natomistic replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations in combination with\nthe iterative Boltzmann inversion are post-refined by benchmarking to\nexperimental data of the radius of gyration. For better handling and a fully\ncontinuous transferability in T-space, the pair potentials are conveniently\ntruncated and mapped to an analytic formula with three structural parameters\nexpressed as explicit continuous functions of T. It is then demonstrated that\nthis model without further adjustments successfully reproduces other\nexperimentally known key thermodynamic properties of semi-dilute PEG solutions\nsuch as the full equation of state (i.e., T-dependent osmotic pressure) for\nvarious chain lengths as well as their cloud point (or collapse) temperature.\n", "  Efficient and high-fidelity prior sampling and inversion for complex\ngeological media is still a largely unsolved challenge. Here, we use a deep\nneural network of the variational autoencoder type to construct a parametric\nlow-dimensional base model parameterization of complex binary geological media.\nFor inversion purposes, it has the attractive feature that random draws from an\nuncorrelated standard normal distribution yield model realizations with spatial\ncharacteristics that are in agreement with the training set. In comparison with\nthe most commonly used parametric representations in probabilistic inversion,\nwe find that our dimensionality reduction (DR) approach outperforms principle\ncomponent analysis (PCA), optimization-PCA (OPCA) and discrete cosine transform\n(DCT) DR techniques for unconditional geostatistical simulation of a\nchannelized prior model. For the considered examples, important compression\nratios (200 - 500) are achieved. Given that the construction of our\nparameterization requires a training set of several tens of thousands of prior\nmodel realizations, our DR approach is more suited for probabilistic (or\ndeterministic) inversion than for unconditional (or point-conditioned)\ngeostatistical simulation. Probabilistic inversions of 2D steady-state and 3D\ntransient hydraulic tomography data are used to demonstrate the DR-based\ninversion. For the 2D case study, the performance is superior compared to\ncurrent state-of-the-art multiple-point statistics inversion by sequential\ngeostatistical resampling (SGR). Inversion results for the 3D application are\nalso encouraging.\n", "  Formation of coffee stain deposits under evaporation of droplets containing\naqueous solution of salts placed on silicone-oil impregnated substrates was\nobserved. The formation of ring-like deposits was registered for various molar\nconcentrations of salts for the droplets of 5-300 microlitres in volume. The\neffect occurred when the contact line was de-pinned, and the evaporation from\nthe edge of a droplet was stopped by the silicone oil. The formation of the\ncoffee stain deposit is related to the soluto-capillary Marangoni flow; the\ninfluence of the thermo-capillary flow taking place in parallel is negligible.\n", "  Phylogenetic approaches have proven to be useful in astrophysics. We have\nrecently published a Maximum Parsimony (or cladistics) analysis on two samples\nof 215 and 85 low-z quasars (z < 0.7) which offer a satisfactory coverage of\nthe Eigenvector 1-derived main sequence. Cladistics is not only able to group\nsources radiating at higher Eddington ratios, to separate radio-quiet (RQ) and\nradio-loud (RL) quasars and properly distinguishes core-dominated and\nlobe-dominated quasars, but it suggests a black hole mass threshold for\npowerful radio emission as already proposed elsewhere. An interesting\ninterpretation from this work is that the phylogeny of quasars may be\nrepresented by the ontogeny of their central black hole, i.e. the increase of\nthe black hole mass. However these exciting results are based on a small sample\nof low-z quasars, so that the work must be extended. We are here faced with two\ndifficulties. The first one is the current lack of a larger sample with similar\nobservables. The second one is the prohibitive computation time to perform a\ncladistic analysis on more that about one thousand objects. We show in this\npaper an experimental strategy on about 1500 galaxies to get around this\ndifficulty. Even if it not related to the quasar study, it is interesting by\nitself and opens new pathways to generalize the quasar findings.\n", "  The framework of shifted boundary conditions has proven to be a very powerful\ntool for the non-perturbative investigation of thermal quantum field theories.\nFor instance, it has been successfully considered for the determination of the\nequation of state of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory with high accuracy. The set-up can\nbe generalized to QCD and it is expected to lead to a similar breakthrough. We\npresent first results for QCD with three flavours of non-perturbatively\nO($a$)-improved Wilson fermions and shifted boundary conditions.\n", "  The performance of modern lithium-sulfur (Li/S) battery systems critically\ndepends on the electrolyte and solvent compositions. For fundamental molecular\ninsights and rational guidance of experimental developments, efficient and\nsufficiently accurate molecular simulations are thus in urgent need. Here, we\nconstruct a molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation model of representative\nstate-of-the art electrolyte-solvent systems for Li/S batteries constituted by\nlithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) and LiNO3 electrolytes in\nmixtures of the organic solvents 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane\n(DOL). We benchmark and verify our simulations by comparing structural and\ndynamic features with various available experimental reference systems and\ndemonstrate their applicability for a wide range of electrolyte-solvent\ncompositions. For the state-of-the-art battery solvent, we finally calculate\nand discuss the detailed composition of the first lithium solvation shell, the\ntemperature dependence of lithium diffusion, as well as the electrolyte\nconductivities and lithium transference numbers. Our model will serve as a\nbasis for efficient future predictions of electrolyte structure and transport\nin complex electrode confinements for the optimization of modern Li/S batteries\n(and related devices).\n", "  In this paper we review both theoretical and experimental studies on\nspin-related photogalvanic effects. A short phenomenological introduction is\nfollowed by the discussion of the circular photogalvanic effect, the direct and\ninverse spin-galvanic effects and the trembling motion of spin-polarized\nelectrons. Then we consider the pure spin currents and magneto-gyrotropic\nphotocurrents. Finally, we discuss the spin-dependent photocurrents in\ntopological insulators and Weyl semimetals.\n", "  Friction forces acting on rotators may promote their alignment and therefore\neliminate degrees of freedom in their movement. The alignment of rotators by\nfriction force was demonstrated by experiments performed with different\nspinners, demonstrating how friction generates negentropy in a system of\nrotators. A gas of rigid rotators influenced by friction force is considered.\nThe orientational negentropy generated by a friction force was estimated with\nthe Sackur-Tetrode equation. The minimal change in total entropy of a system of\nrotators, corresponding to their eventual alignment, decreases with\ntemperature. The reported effect may be of the primary importance for a phase\nequilibrium and motion of ubiquitous colloidal and granular systems.\n", "  We propose new types of models of the appearance of small- and large scale\nstructures in media with memory, including a hyperbolic modification of the\nNavier-Stokes equations and a class of dynamical low-dimensional models with\nmemory effects. On the basis of computer modeling, the formation of the\nsmall-scale structures and collapses and the appearance of new chaotic\nsolutions are demonstrated. Possibilities of the application of some proposed\nmodels to the description of the burst-type processes and collapses o nthe Sun\nare discussed.\n", "  We investigate under which conditions the cosmological constant vanishes\nperturbatively at the one-loop level for heterotic strings on\nnon-supersymmetric toroidal orbifolds. To obtain model-independent results,\nwhich do not rely on the gauge embedding details, we require that the\nright-moving fermionic partition function vanishes identically in every\norbifold sector. This means that each sector preserves at least one, but not\nalways the same Killing spinor. The existence of such Killing spinors is\nrelated to the representation theory of finite groups, i.e. of the point group\nthat underlies the orbifold. However, by going through all inequivalent\n(Abelian and non-Abelian) point groups of six-dimensional toroidal orbifolds we\nshow that this is never possible: For any non-supersymmetric orbifold there is\nalways (at least) one sector, that does not admit any Killing spinor. The\nunderlying mathematical reason for this no-go result is formulated in a\nconjecture, which we have tested by going through an even larger number of\nfinite groups. This conjecture could be applied to situations beyond symmetric\ntoroidal orbifolds, like asymmetric orbifolds.\n", "  In these pedagogical notes I introduce the operator form of Wick's theorem,\ni.e. a procedure to bring to normal order a product of 1-particle creation and\ndestruction operators, with respect to some reference many-body state. Both the\nstatic and the time- ordered cases are presented.\n", "  With the help of a mathematical model, the metabolic process of the Krebs\ncycle is studied. The autocatalytic processes resulting in both the formation\nof the self-organization in the Krebs cycle and the appearance of a cyclicity\nof its dynamics are determined. Some structural-functional connections creating\nthe synchronism of an autoperiodic functioning at the transport in the\nrespiratory chain and the oxidative phosphorylation are investigated. The\nconditions for breaking the synchronization of processes, increasing the\nmultiplicity of a cyclicity, and for the appearance of chaotic modes are\nanalyzed. The phase-parametric diagram of a cascade of bifurcations showing the\ntransition to a chaotic mode by the Feigenbaum scenario is obtained. The\nfractal nature of the revealed cascade of bifurcations is demonstrated. The\nstrange attractors formed as a result of the folding are obtained. The results\nobtained give the idea of structural-functional connections, due to which the\nself-organization appears in the metabolic process running in a cell. The\nconstructed mathematical model can be applied to the study of the toxic and\nallergic effects of drugs and various substances on the metabolism of a cell.\n", "  In the present study we are performing simulation of simple model of two\npatch colloidal particles undergoing irreversible diffusion limited cluster\naggregation using patchy Brownian cluster dynamics. In addition to the\nirreversible aggregation of patches, the spheres are coupled with isotropic\nreversible aggregation through the Kern-Frenkel potential. Due to the presence\nof anisotropic and isotropic potential we have also defined 3 different kinds\nof clusters formed due to anisotropic potential and isotropic potential only as\nwell as both the potentials together. We have investigated the effect of patch\nsize on self-assembly under different solvent qualities for various volume\nfractions. We will show that at low volume fractions during aggregation\nprocess, we end up in a chain conformation for smaller patch size while in a\nglobular conformation for bigger patch size. We also observed a chain to bundle\ntransformation depending on the attractive interaction strength between the\nchains or in other words depending on the quality of the solvent. We will also\nshow that bundling process is very similar to nucleation and growth phenomena\nobserved in colloidal system with short range attraction. We have also studied\nthe bond angle distribution for this system, where for small patches only 2\nangles are more probable indicating chain formation, while for bundling at very\nlow volume fraction a tail is developed in the distribution. While for the case\nof higher patch angle this distribution is broad compared to the case of low\npatch angles showing we have a more globular conformation. We are also\nproposing a model for the formation of bundles which are similar to amyloid\nfibers using two patch colloidal particles.\n", "  A second generation of gravitational wave detectors will soon come online\nwith the objective of measuring for the first time the tiny gravitational\nsignal from the coalescence of black hole and/or neutron star binaries. In this\ncommunication, we propose a new time-frequency search method alternative to\nmatched filtering techniques that are usually employed to detect this signal.\nThis method relies on a graph that encodes the time evolution of the signal and\nits variability by establishing links between coefficients in the multi-scale\ntime-frequency decomposition of the data. We provide a proof of concept for\nthis approach.\n", "  Colloidal Cadmium Selenide (CdSe) nanoplatelets (NPLs) are a recently\ndeveloped class of efficient luminescent nanomaterial suitable for\noptoelectronic device applications. A change in temperature greatly affects\ntheir electronic bandstructure and luminescence properties. It is important to\nunderstand how-and-why the characteristics of NPLs are influenced, particularly\nat elevated temperature, where both reversible and irreversible quenching\nprocesses come into picture. Here we present a study on the effect of elevated\ntemperature on the characteristics of colloidal CdSe NPLs. We used an\neffective-mass envelope function theory based 8-band k$\\cdot$p model and\ndensity-matrix theory considering exciton-phonon interaction. We observed the\nphotoluminescence (PL) spectra at various temperatures for their photon\nemission energy, PL linewidth and intensity by considering the exciton-phonon\ninteraction with both acoustic and optical phonons using Bose-Einstein\nstatistical factors. With rise in temperature we observed a fall in the\ntransition energy (emission redshift), matrix element, Fermi factor and quasi\nFermi separation, with reduction in intraband state gaps and increased\ninterband coupling. Also, there was a fall in the PL intensity, along with\nspectral broadening due to an intraband scattering effect. The predicted\ntransition energy values and simulated PL spectra at varying temperatures\nexhibit appreciable consistency with experimental results. Our findings have\nimportant implications for application of NPLs in optoelectronic devices, such\nas NPL lasers and LEDs, operating much above room temperature.\n", "  We investigate with computer simulations the critical radius of pores in a\nlipid bilayer membrane. Ilton et al. (2016) recently showed that nucleated\npores in a homopolymer film can increase or decrease in size, depending on\nwhether they are larger or smaller than a critical size which scales linearly\nwith film thickness. Using dissipative particle dynamics, a particle-based\nsimulation method, we investigate the same scenario for a lipid bilayer\nmembrane whose structure is determined by lipid-water interactions. We simulate\na perforated membrane in which holes larger than a critical radius grow, while\nholes smaller than the critical radius close, as in the experiment of Ilton et\nal. (2016). By altering system parameters such as the number of particles per\nlipid and the periodicity, we also describe scenarios in which pores of any\ninitial size can seal or even remain stable, showing a fundamental difference\nin the behavior of lipid membranes from polymer films.\n", "  In present paper we suggest exact solution of the Poisson problem which\nappears in frequently addressed applications regarding calculation of the\ngravitational potential of spiral galaxies. We suggest an analytical solution\nfor the problem in cylindrical coordinates by using the finite integral\ntransform technique. The final solution is presented as expansion on the\neigenfunctions of the corresponding Sturm-Liouville problem. Green function of\nthe problem is constructed.\n", "  Optimization problems pervade essentially every scientific discipline and\nindustry. Many such problems require finding a solution that maximizes the\nnumber of constraints satisfied. Often, these problems are particularly\ndifficult to solve because they belong to the NP-hard class, namely algorithms\nthat always find a solution in polynomial time are not known. Over the past\ndecades, research has focused on developing heuristic approaches that attempt\nto find an approximation to the solution. However, despite numerous research\nefforts, in many cases even approximations to the optimal solution are hard to\nfind, as the computational time for further refining a candidate solution grows\nexponentially with input size. Here, we show a non-combinatorial approach to\nhard optimization problems that achieves an exponential speed-up and finds\nbetter approximations than the current state-of-the-art. First, we map the\noptimization problem into a boolean circuit made of specially designed,\nself-organizing logic gates, which can be built with (non-quantum) electronic\ncomponents; the equilibrium points of the circuit represent the approximation\nto the problem at hand. Then, we solve its associated non-linear ordinary\ndifferential equations numerically, towards the equilibrium points. We\ndemonstrate this exponential gain by comparing a sequential MatLab\nimplementation of our solver with the winners of the 2016 Max-SAT competition\non a variety of hard optimization instances. We show empirical evidence that\nour solver scales linearly with the size of the problem, both in time and\nmemory, and argue that this property derives from the collective behavior of\nthe simulated physical circuit. Our approach can be applied to other types of\noptimization problems and the results presented here have far-reaching\nconsequences in many fields.\n", "  In this work, the motion of a dust particle under the influence of the random\nforce due to dust charge fluctuations is considered as a non-Markovian\nstochastic process. Memory effects in the velocity process of the dust particle\nare studied. A model is developed based on the fractional Langevin equation for\nthe motion of the dust grain. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the dust\ngrain is derived from this equation. The mean-square displacement and the\nvelocity autocorrelation function of the dust particle are obtained in terms of\nthe Mittag-Leffler functions. Their asymptotic behavior and the dust particle\ntemperature due to charge fluctuations are studied in the long-time limit. As\nan interesting result, it is found that the presence of memory effects in the\nvelocity process of the dust particle as a non-Markovian process can cause an\nanomalous diffusion in dusty plasmas. In this case, the velocity\nautocorrelation function of the dust particle has a power-law decay like\n$t^{-\\alpha-2}$, where the exponent $\\alpha$ take values $0<\\alpha<1$.\n", "  Combining multiple fast image acquisitions to mitigate scan noise and drift\nartifacts has proven essential for picometer precision, quantitative analysis\nof atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) data. For\nvery low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) image stacks - frequently required for\nundistorted imaging at liquid nitrogen temperatures - image registration is\nparticularly delicate, and standard approaches may either fail, or produce\nsubtly specious reconstructed lattice images. We present an approach which\neffectively registers and averages image stacks which are challenging due to\ntheir low-SNR and propensity for unit cell misalignments. Registering all\npossible image pairs in a multi-image stack leads to significant information\nsurplus. In combination with a simple physical picture of stage drift, this\nenables identification of incorrect image registrations, and determination of\nthe optimal image shifts from the complete set of relative shifts. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on experimental, cryogenic STEM\ndatasets, highlighting subtle artifacts endemic to low-SNR lattice images and\nhow they can be avoided. High-SNR average images with information transfer out\nto 0.72 A are achieved at 300 kV and with the sample cooled to near liquid\nnitrogen temperature.\n", "  Minimization of the number of numerically calculated coefficients for new\nanalytical forms as a product of exponential function r1 by the sum of the\nexponential terms Ai*exp(-ai*r2) have been done. The optimum is N=10.\nCalculations have been done for realistic phenomenological Reid93 potential.\nSpherical S0 and quadrupole S2 form factors is parameterized by the\ncoefficients for deuteron wave function in coordinate representation. The\nresult t20(p) in wide area of momentas for Reid93 potential agreed well with\nthe literature results for other potential nucleon-nucleon models, and with\nexperimental datas of world collaborations and reviews. The obtained results\nwill allow studying the deuteron electromagnetic structure, its form-factors,\ndifferential cross section of double scattering in more detail in future, and\nalso for calculations the theoretical values of spin observables in dp-\nscattering.\n", "  Interfacial nucleation is the dominant process of dislocation generation\nduring the plastic deformation of nano-crystalline materials. Solute additions\nintended to stabilize nano-crystalline metals against grain growth, may\nsegregate to the grain boundaries and triple junctions where they can affect\nthe process of the dislocation emission. In this Letter we demonstrate that the\neffect of solute addition in a nano-crystalline material containing competing\nsolute segregation sites and dislocation sources can be very complex due to\ndifferent rates of segregation at different interfaces. Moreover, at large\nconcentrations, when the solutes form clusters near the grain boundaries or\ntriple junctions, the interfaces between these clusters and the matrix can\nintroduce new dislocation emission sources, which can be activated under lower\napplied stress. Thus, the strength maximum can occur at a certain solute\nconcentration: adding solutes beyond this optimal solute concentration can\nreduce the strength of the material.\n", "  The theory of geometric quantum mechanics describes a quantum system as a\nHamiltonian dynamical system with a complex projective Hilbert space as its\nphase space, thus equipped with a Riemannian metric in addition to a symplectic\nstructure. This paper extends the geometric quantum theory to include aspects\nof the symplectic topology of the state space by identifying the\nRobertson-Schr\\\"{o}dinger uncertainty relation for pure quantum states as the\ndifferential version of the energy identity in the theory of $J$-holomorphic\ncurves. We consider a family of maps from a Riemann surface into a\nfinite-dimensional quantum state space by using the vector fields generated by\ntwo quantum observables,and show that the Fubini-Study metric tensor pulls back\nby such a map to the covariance tensor for the two observables. By calculating\nthe map energy density in the pull-back metric, the uncertainty relation is\nrepresented as an equality that compares the map energy differential to the sum\nof the pull-back of the symplectic form and a positive definite term that\nvanishes when the map is holomorphic. Saturation of the\nRobertson-Schr\\\"{o}dinger inequality occurs when the map is conformal and the\noff-diagonal covariance terms vanish. For compact Riemann surfaces where such a\nmap can be globally defined, if the map is holomorphic, it is harmonic and its\nimage is a minimal surface. In this case, the uncertainty product integral is a\ntopological invariant that depends only on the homology class of the curve\nmodulo its boundary.\n", "  Absorption of light is directly associated with dissipative processes in a\nmaterial. In suitably tailored resonators, a specific level of dissipation can\nsupport coherent perfect absorption, the time-reversed analogue of lasing,\nwhich enables total absorption and zero scattering in open cavities. On the\ncontrary, the scattering zeros of lossless objects strictly occur at complex\nfrequencies. While usually considered non-physical due to their divergent\nresponse in time, these zeros play a crucial role in the overall scattering\ndispersion. Here, we introduce the concept of coherent virtual absorption,\naccessing these modes by temporally shaping the incident waveform. We show that\nengaging these complex zeros enables storing and releasing the electromagnetic\nenergy at will within a lossless structure for arbitrary amounts of time, under\nthe control of the impinging field. The effect is robust with respect to\ninevitable material dissipation and can be realized in systems with any number\nof input ports. The observed effect may have important implications for\nflexible control of light propagation and storage, low-energy memory, and\noptical modulation.\n", "  We present a comparison between the time-evolution over the past $\\sim 20$\nyears of the radio continuum and H$\\alpha$ emission of HH~1 and 2. We find that\nthe radio continuum and the H$\\alpha$ emission of both objects show very\nsimilar trends, with HH~1 becoming fainter and HH~2 brightening quite\nconsiderably (about a factor of 2). We also find that the $F_{\\rm\nH\\alpha}/F_{ff}$ (H$\\alpha$ to free-free continuum) ratio of HH~1 and 2 has\nhigher values than the ones typically found in planetary nebulae (PNe) which we\ninterpret as an indication that the H$\\alpha$ and free-free emission of HH~1/2\nis produced in emitting regions with lower temperatures ($\\sim 2000$~K) than\nthe emission of PNe (with $\\sim 10^4$~K).\n", "  We examine and extend Sparse Grids as a discretization method for partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs). Solving a PDE in $D$ dimensions has a cost that\ngrows as $O(N^D)$ with commonly used methods. Even for moderate $D$ (e.g.\n$D=3$), this quickly becomes prohibitively expensive for increasing problem\nsize $N$. This effect is known as the Curse of Dimensionality. Sparse Grids\noffer an alternative discretization method with a much smaller cost of $O(N\n\\log^{D-1}N)$. In this paper, we introduce the reader to Sparse Grids, and\nextend the method via a Discontinuous Galerkin approach. We then solve the\nscalar wave equation in up to $6+1$ dimensions, comparing cost and accuracy\nbetween full and sparse grids. Sparse Grids perform far superior, even in three\ndimensions. Our code is freely available as open source, and we encourage the\nreader to reproduce the results we show.\n"]}
