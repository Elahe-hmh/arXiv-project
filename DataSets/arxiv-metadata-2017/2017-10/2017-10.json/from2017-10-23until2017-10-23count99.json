We find that disorders localize\nthe antiferromagnetic spin density wave induced by imbalanced fermions and the\nincrease of the disorder magnitude shrinks the areas of the localized\nantiferromagnetized regions. Moreover, the antiferromagnetism finally\ndisappears above a large disorder. These behaviors are observable in atomic\nFermi gases loaded on optical lattices and disordered strongly-correlated\nchains under magnetic field.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the linear and nonlinear conductance through a\nnanostructure with two-fold degenerate single levels, corresponding to the\ntransport through nanostructures such as a carbon nanotube, or double dot\nsystems with capacitive interaction. It is shown that the presence of the\ninteraction asymmetry between orbits/dots affects significantly the profile of\nthe linear conductance at finite temperature, and, of the nonlinear\nconductance, particularly around half-filling, where the two-particle Kondo\neffect occurs. Within the range of experimentally feasible parameters, the\nSU(4) universal behavior is suggested, and comparison with relevant experiments\nis made.\n", "  It is typically assumed that emission in the passbands of the Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is\ndominated by single or several strong lines from ions that under equilibrium\nconditions are formed in a narrow range of temperatures. However, most SDO/AIA\nchannels also contain contributions from lines of ions that have formation\ntemperatures that are significantly different from the \"dominant\" ion(s). We\ninvestigate the importance of these lines by forward modeling the emission in\nthe SDO/AIA channels with 3D radiative MHD simulations of a model that spans\nthe upper layer of the convection zone to the low corona. The model is highly\ndynamic. In addition, we pump a steadily increasing magnetic flux into the\ncorona, in order to increase the coronal temperature through the dissipation of\nmagnetic stresses. As a consequence, the model covers different ranges of\ncoronal temperatures as time progresses. The model covers coronal temperatures\nthat are representative of plasma conditions in coronal holes and quiet sun.\nThe 131, 171, and 304 \\AA{} AIA passbands are found to be least influenced by\nthe so-called \"non-dominant\" ions, and the emission observed in these channels\ncomes mostly from plasma at temperatures near the formation temperature of the\ndominant ion(s). On the other hand, the other channels are strongly influenced\nby the non-dominant ions, and therefore significant emission in these channels\ncomes from plasma at temperatures that are different from the \"canonical\"\nvalues. We have also studied the influence of non-dominant ions on the AIA\npassbands when different element abundances are assumed (photospheric and\ncoronal), and when the effects of the electron density on the contribution\nfunction are taken into account.\n", "  We study nonequilibrium generation of spin-dependent transport through a\nsingle-level quantum dot embedded in a ring with the Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling. We consider nonmagnetic systems, involving no magnetic field nor\nferromagnetic leads. It is theoretically predicted that large spin-dependent\ncurrent occurs as a combined effect of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction, the\nKondo effect, and nonequilibrium effect, without using magnetic field or\nmaterial. The phenomenon is viewed as a new nonequilibrium correlation effect\nthat disappears when either interaction or finite bias is absent. We show how\nthe Kondo physics is connected with such emergent spin phenomenon by employing\nthe finite interaction slave-boson approach.\n", "  For a weakly-interacting Bose gas rotating in a harmonic trap we relate the\nyrast states of small systems (that can be treated exactly) to the\nthermodynamic limit (derived within the mean-field approximation). For a few\ndozens of atoms, the yrast line shows distinct quasi-periodic oscillations with\nincreasing angular momentum that originate from the internal structure of the\nexact many-body states. These finite-size effects disappear in the\nthermodynamic limit, where the Gross-Pitaevskii approximation provides the\nexact energy to leading order in the number of particles N. However, the exact\nyrast states reveal significant structure not captured by the mean-field\napproximation: Even in the limit of large N, the corresponding mean-field\nsolution accounts for only a fraction of the total weight of the exact quantum\nstate.\n", "  In this paper a loophole in the SU(2) gauge anomaly is presented. It is shown\nthat using several topological tools a theory can be designed that implements\nthe quantization of a single Weyl doublet anomaly free while keeping the\nnon-abelian character of the particle in the theory. This opens the perspective\nfor non-Abelian statistics of deconfined particle like objects in 3+1\ndimensions and for applications in Quantum Computing. Moreover, if this\nloophole cannot be closed, old arguments related to anomaly cancelations must\nbe reviewed.\n", "  We study the nonequilibrium spectral function of the single-impurity Anderson\nmodel connecting with multi-terminal leads. The full dependence on frequency\nand bias voltage of the nonequilibrium self-energy and spectral function is\nobtained analytically up to the second-order perturbation regarding the\ninteraction strength $U$. High and low bias voltage properties are analyzed for\na generic multi-terminal dot, showing a crossover from the Kondo resonance to\nthe Coulomb peaks with increasing bias voltage. For a dot where the\nparticle-hole symmetry is not present, we construct a current-preserving\nevaluation of the nonequilibrium spectral function for arbitrary bias voltage.\nIt is shown that finite bias voltage does not split the Kondo resonance in this\norder, and no specific structure due to multiple leads emerges. Overall bias\ndependence is quite similar to finite temperature effect for a dot with or\nwithout the particle-hole symmetry.\n", "  In this erratum we present the correct result for the magnetization of the\nthree flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model which was originally obtained by us in\nPhys Rev C91, 065205 (2015).\n", "  In this paper, we are considering two first order corrections to both gravity\nand gauge sides of the Einstein-Maxwell gravity: Gauss-Bonnet gravity and\nquadratic Maxwell invariant as corrections. We obtain horizonless magnetic\nsolutions by implying a metric which representing a topological defect. We\nanalyze the geometric properties of the solutions and investigate the effects\nof both corrections, and find that these solutions may be interpreted as the\nmagnetic branes. We study the singularity condition and find a nonsingular\nspacetime with a conical geometry. We also investigate the effects of different\nparameters on deficit angle of spacetime near the origin.\n", "  In this paper we consider three dimensional BTZ black holes with three models\nof nonlinear electrodynamics as source. Calculating heat capacity, we study the\nstability and phase transitions of these black holes. We show that Maxwell,\nlogarithmic and exponential theories yield only type one phase transition which\nis related to the root(s) of heat capacity. Whereas for correction form of\nnonlinear electrodynamics, heat capacity contains two roots and one divergence\npoint. Next, we use geometrical approach for studying classical thermodynamical\nbehavior of the system. We show that Weinhold and Ruppeiner metrics fail to\nprovide fruitful results and the consequences of the Quevedo approach are not\ncompletely matched to the heat capacity results. Then, we employ a new metric\nfor solving this problem. We show that this approach is successful and all\ndivergencies of its Ricci scalar and phase transition points coincide. We also\nshow that there is no phase transition for uncharged BTZ black holes.\n", "  In this paper, we consider Lovelock gravity in presence of two Born-Infeld\ntypes of nonlinear electrodynamics and study their thermodynamical behavior. We\nextend the phase space by considering cosmological constant as a\nthermodynamical pressure. We obtain critical values of pressure, volume and\ntemperature and investigate the effects of both the Lovelock gravity and the\nnonlinear electrodynamics on these values. We plot $P-v$, $T-v$ and $G-T$\ndiagrams to study the phase transition of these thermodynamical systems. We\nshow that power of the nonlinearity and gravity have opposite effects. We also\nshow how considering cosmological constant, nonlinearity and Lovelock\nparameters as thermodynamical variables will modify Smarr formula and first law\nof thermodynamics. In addition, we study the behavior of universal ratio of\n$\\frac{P_{c}v_{c}}{T_{c}}$ for different values of nonlinearity power of\nelectrodynamics as well as the Lovelock coefficients.\n", "  Electron correlation in graphene is unique because of the interplay of the\nDirac cone dispersion of $\\pi$ electrons with long range Coulomb interaction.\nThe random phase approximation predicts no metallic screening at long distance\nand low energy because of the zero density of states at Fermi level, so one\nmight expect that graphene should be a poorly screened system. However,\nempirically graphene is a weakly interacting semimetal, which leads to the\nquestion of how electron correlations take place in graphene at different\nlength scales. We address this question by computing the equal time and dynamic\nstructure factor $S(\\vec q)$ and $S(\\vec q, \\omega)$ of freestanding graphene\nusing {\\it ab-initio} fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo and the random phase\napproximation. We find that the $\\sigma$ electrons contribute strongly to\n$S(\\vec q,\\omega)$ for relevant experimental values of $\\omega$ even at\ndistances up to around 80 \\AA. These findings illustrate how the emergent\nphysics from underlying Coulomb interactions results in the observed weakly\ncorrelated semimetal.\n", "  One common way to define spontaneous symmetry breaking involves explicit\nsymmetry breaking. This definition can be used in any approach to Effective\nField Theory, from perturbation theory to lattice simulations. It allows us to\nstudy the spontaneous breakdown of global symmetries without assuming that the\nlocal gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is important since\nperturbation theory is insufficient to study extended Higgs sectors: it is\ninsufficient to predict the physical spectrum of the SU(5) Grand Unified Theory\n(Georgi-Glashow) or to predict the spontaneous breakdown of global symmetries.\n  We also study background symmetries: these are symmetries that despite they\nare already explicitly broken, can be still spontaneously broken. We analyse\nexamples where a background CP (charge-parity) symmetry is not spontaneously\nbroken: in the Standard Model, in rephasing symmetries and in geometrical\nCP-violation.\n  We show that all fields are real representations of the group of symmetries,\nsince CP is a unitary transformation. There are consequences: to study\naccidental symmetries (e.g. custodial symmetry, pseudo-golstone bosons) we must\nconsider real representations; CP is a symmetry of order 4 if the neutrinos are\nMajorana particles and the notion of CP-violating phases is inconsistent in\nsome Lagrangians; a recent claim that a toy model exhibits physical\nCP-violation while the CP symmetry is conserved by the Lagrangian and the\nvacuum is false.\n", "  It is remarked that fluxes in conservation laws, such as the Reynolds\nstresses in the momentum equation of turbulent shear flows, or the spectral\nenergy flux in isotropic turbulence, are only defined up to an arbitrary\nsolenoidal field. While this is not usually significant for long-time averages,\nit becomes important when fluxes are modelled locally in large-eddy\nsimulations, or in the analysis of intermittency and cascades. As an example, a\nnumerical procedure is introduced to compute fluxes in scalar conservation\nequations in such a way that their total integrated magnitude is minimised. The\nresult is an irrotational vector field that derives from a potential, thus\nminimising sterile flux `circuits'. The algorithm is generalised to tensor\nfluxes and applied to the transfer of momentum in a turbulent channel. The\nresulting instantaneous Reynolds stresses are compared with their traditional\nexpressions, and found to be substantially different.\n", "  The turbulent/non-turbulent interface is analysed in a direct numerical\nsimulation of a boundary layer in the range $Re_\\theta=2800-6600$, with\nemphasis on the behaviour of the relatively large-scale fractal intermittent\nregion. This requires the introduction of a new definition of the distance\nbetween a point and a general surface, which is compared with the more usual\nvertical distance to the top of the layer. Interfaces are obtained by\nthresholding the enstrophy field and the magnitude of the rate-of-strain\ntensor, and it is concluded that, while the former are physically relevant\nfeatures, the latter are not. By varying the threshold, a topological\ntransition is identified as the interface moves from the free stream into the\nturbulent core. A vorticity scale is defined that collapses that transition for\ndifferent Reynolds numbers, roughly equivalent to the root-mean-squared\nvorticity at the edge of the boundary layer. Conditionally averaged flow\nvariables are analysed as functions of the new distance, both within and\noutside the interface. It is found that the interface contains a nonequilibrium\nlayer whose thickness scales well with the Taylor microscale, enveloping a\nself-similar layer spanning a fixed fraction of the boundary-layer thickness.\nInterestingly, the straining structure of the flow is similar in both regions.\nIrrotational pockets within the turbulent core are also studied. They form a\nself-similar set whose size decreases with increasing depth, presumably due to\nbreak-up by the turbulence, but the rate of viscous diffusion is independent of\nthe pocket size. The raw data used in the analysis are freely available from\nour web page (http://torroja.dmt.upm.es).\n", "  Observations of the upper chromosphere shows an enormous amount of intricate\nfine structure. Much of this comes in the form of linear features which are\nmost often assumed to be well aligned with the direction of the magnetic field\nin the low plasma beta regime thought to dominate the upper chromosphere. We\nuse advanced radiative MHD simulations including the effects of ion-neutral\ninteractions (using the generalized Ohm's law) in the partially ionized\nchromosphere to show that the magnetic field is often not well aligned with\nchromospheric features. This occurs where the ambipolar diffusion is large,\ni.e., ions and neutral populations decouple as the ion-neutral collision\nfrequency drops allowing the field to slip through the neutral population,\ncurrents perpendicular to the field are strong, and thermodynamic timescales\nare longer than or similar to the those of ambipolar diffusion. We find this\noften happens in dynamic spicule or fibril-like features at the top of the\nchromosphere. This has important consequences for field extrapolation methods\nwhich increasingly use such upper chromospheric features to help constrain the\nchromospheric magnetic field: our results invalidate the underlying assumption\nthat these features are aligned with the field. In addition, our results cast\ndoubt on results from 1D hydrodynamic models, which assume that plasma remains\non the same field lines. Finally, our simulations show that ambipolar diffusion\nsignificantly alters the amount of free energy available in the coronal part of\nour simulated volume, which is likely to have consequences for studies of flare\ninitiation.\n", "  Recently, numerical simulations showed that X-ray photons emitted by\naccretion disks acquire rotation of polarization angle and orbital angular\nmomentum due to strong gravitational field in the vicinity of the rotating\nblack holes. Based on these two degrees of freedom we construct a bipartite\ntwo-level quantum system of the accretion disk's photons. To characterize the\nquantum states of this composite system we consider linear entropy for the\nreduced density matrix of polarization with the intention to exploit its direct\nrelation with the photons degree of polarization. Accordingly, the minimum\ndegree of polarization of X-ray radiation located in the transition region of\nthe accretion disk indicates a high value of the linear entropy for the photons\nemitted on this region, inferring a high degree of entanglement in the\ncomposite system. We emphasize that for an extreme rotating black hole in the\nthermal state, the photons with energies at the thermal peak are maximally\nentangled in polarization and orbital angular momentum, leading to the creation\nof all four Bell states. Detection and measurement of quantum information\nencoded in photons emitted in the accretion disk around rotating black holes\nmay be performed by actual quantum information technology.\n", "  Failure, damage spread and recovery crucially underlie many spatially\nembedded networked systems ranging from transportation structures to the human\nbody. Here we study the interplay between spontaneous damage, induced failure\nand recovery in both embedded and non-embedded networks. In our model the\nnetwork's components follow three realistic processes that capture these\nfeatures: (i) spontaneous failure of a component independent of the\nneighborhood (internal failure), (ii) failure induced by failed neighboring\nnodes (external failure) and (iii) spontaneous recovery of a component.We\nidentify a metastable domain in the global network phase diagram spanned by the\nmodel's control parameters where dramatic hysteresis effects and random\nswitching between two coexisting states are observed. The loss of\npredictability due to these effects depend on the characteristic link length of\nthe embedded system. For the Euclidean lattice in particular, hysteresis and\nswitching only occur in an extremely narrow region of the parameter space\ncompared to random networks. We develop a unifying theory which links the\ndynamics of our model to contact processes. Our unifying framework may help to\nbetter understand predictability and controllability in spatially embedded and\nrandom networks where spontaneous recovery of components can mitigate\nspontaneous failure and damage spread in the global network.\n", "  Surface plasmon polaritons enable light concentration within subwavelength\nregions, opening thereby new avenues for miniaturizing the device and\nstrengthening light-matter interactions. Here we realize effective\nelectro-optic modulation in low-loss plasmonic waveguides with the aid of\ngraphene, and the devices are fully integrated in the silicon-on-insulator\nplatform. By advantageously exploiting low-loss plasmonic slot-waveguide modes,\nwhich weakly leak into a substrate while feature strong fields within the\ntwo-layer-graphene covered slots in metal, we successfully achieve a tunability\nof 0.13 dB/um for our fabricated graphene-plasmonic waveguide devices with\nextremely low insertion loss, which outperforms previously reported\ngraphene-plasmonic devices. Our results highlight the potential of graphene\nplasmonic leaky-mode hybrid waveguides to realized active ultra-compact devices\nfor optoelectronic applications.\n", "  Important properties of a quantum system are not directly measurable, but\nthey can be disclosed by how fast the system changes under controlled\nperturbations. In particular, asymmetry and entanglement can be verified by\nreconstructing the state of a quantum system. Yet, this usually requires\nexperimental and computational resources which increase exponentially with the\nsystem size. Here we show how to detect metrologically useful asymmetry and\nentanglement by a limited number of measurements. This is achieved by studying\nhow they affect the speed of evolution of a system under a unitary\ntransformation. We show that the speed of multiqubit systems can be evaluated\nby measuring a set of local observables, providing exponential advantage with\nrespect to state tomography. Indeed, the presented method requires neither the\nknowledge of the state and the parameter-encoding Hamiltonian nor global\nmeasurements performed on all the constituent subsystems. We implement the\ndetection scheme in an all-optical experiment.\n", "  For \"static memory materials\" the bulk properties depend on boundary\nconditions. Such materials can be realized by classical statistical systems\nwhich admit no unique equilibrium state. We describe the propagation of\ninformation from the boundary to the bulk by classical wave functions. The\ndependence of wave functions on the location of hypersurfaces in the bulk is\ngoverned by a linear evolution equation that can be viewed as a generalized\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. Classical wave functions obey the superposition\nprinciple, with local probabilities realized as bilinears of wave functions.\nFor static memory materials the evolution within a subsector is unitary, as\ncharacteristic for the time evolution in quantum mechanics. The\nspace-dependence in static memory materials can be used as an analogue\nrepresentation of the time evolution in quantum mechanics - such materials are\n\"quantum simulators\". For example, an asymmetric Ising model on a Euclidean\ntwo-dimensional lattice represents the time evolution of free relativistic\nfermions in two-dimensional Minkowski space.\n", "  Unitarity of scale-invariant coupled theory of higher-derivative gravity and\nmatter is investigated. A scalar field coupled with dirac fermion is taken as\nmatter sector.Following the idea of induced gravity Einstein-Hilbert term is\ngenerated via dynamical symmetry breaking of scale-invariance. The\nrenormalisation group flows are computed and one-loop RG improved effective\npotential of scalar is calculated. Scalar field develops a new minimum via\nColeman-Weinberg procedure inducing Newton's constant and masses in the matter\nsector. The spin-2 problematic ghost and the spin-0 mode of the metric\nfluctuation gets a mass in the broken phase of theory. The energy-dependence of\nVeV in the RG improved scenario implies a running for the induced parameters.\nThis sets up platform to ask whether it is possible to evade the spin-2 ghost\nby keeping its mass always above the running energy scale? In broken phase this\nquestion is satisfactorily answered for a large domain of coupling parameter\nspace where the ghost is evaded. The spin-0 mode can be made physically\nrealisable or not depending upon the choice of initial parameters. Induced\nNewton's constant is seen to vanishes in ultraviolet. By properly choosing\nparameters it is possible to make the matter fields physically unrealisable.\n", "  X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements of iron nano-islands\ngrown on graphene and covered with a Au film for passivation reveal that the\noxidation through defects in the Au film spontaneously leads to the formation\nof magnetite nano-particles (i.e, $Fe_3$$O_4$). The Fe nano-islands (20 and 75\nmonolayers; MLs) are grown on epitaxial graphene formed by thermally annealing\n6H-SiC(0001) and subsequently covered, in the growth chamber, with nominal 20\nlayers of Au. Our X-ray absorption spectroscopy and XMCD measurements at\napplied magnetic fields show that the thin film (20 ML) is totally converted to\nmagnetite whereas the thicker film (75 ML) exhibits properties of magnetite but\nalso those of pure metallic iron. Temperature dependence of the XMCD signal (of\nboth samples) shows a clear transition at $T_{\\rm V}\\approx 120$ K consistent\nwith the Verwey transition of bulk magnetite. These results have implications\non the synthesis of magnetite nano-crystals and also on their regular\narrangements on functional substrates such as graphene.\n", "  We theoretically study the levitation of a single magnetic domain nanosphere\nin an external static magnetic field. We show that apart from the stability\nprovided by the mechanical rotation of the nanomagnet (as in the classical\nLevitron), the quantum spin origin of its magnetization provides two additional\nmechanisms to stably levitate the system. Despite of the Earnshaw theorem, such\nstable phases are present even in the absence of mechanical rotation. For large\nmagnetic fields, the Larmor precession of the quantum magnetic moment\nstabilizes the system in full analogy with magnetic trapping of a neutral atom.\nFor low magnetic fields, the magnetic anisotropy stabilizes the system via the\nEinstein-de Haas effect. These results are obtained with a linear stability\nanalysis of a single magnetic domain rigid nanosphere with uniaxial anisotropy\nin a Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic field.\n", "  Most stars in the Galaxy are believed to be formed within star clusters from\ncollapsing molecular clouds. However, the complete process of star formation,\nfrom the parent cloud to a gas-free star cluster, is still poorly understood.\nWe perform radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of a turbulent\nmolecular cloud using the RAMSES-RT code. Stars are modelled using sink\nparticles, from which we self-consistently follow the propagation of the\nionising radiation. We study how different feedback models affect the gas\nexpulsion from the cloud and how they shape the final properties of the\nemerging star cluster. We find that the star formation efficiency is lower for\nstronger feedback models. Feedback also changes the high mass end of the\nstellar mass function. Stronger feedback also allows the establishment of a\nlower density star cluster, which can maintain a virial or sub-virial state. In\nthe absence of feedback, the star formation efficiency is very high, as well as\nthe final stellar density. As a result, high energy close encounters make the\ncluster evaporate quickly. Other indicators, such as mass segregation,\nstatistics of multiple systems and escaping stars confirm this picture.\nObservations of young star clusters are in best agreement with our strong\nfeedback simulation.\n", "  We introduce a novel technique, called \"granulometry\", to characterize and\nrecover the mean size and the size distribution of HII regions from 21-cm\ntomography. The technique is easy to implement, but places the previously not\nvery well defined concept of morphology on a firm mathematical foundation. The\nsize distribution of the cold spots in 21-cm tomography can be used as a direct\ntracer of the underlying probability distribution of HII region sizes. We\nexplore the capability of the method using large-scale reionization simulations\nand mock observational data cubes while considering capabilities of SKA1-low\nand a future extension to SKA2. We show that the technique allows the recovery\nof the HII region size distribution with a moderate signal-to-noise ratio from\nwide-field imaging ($\\rm SNR\\lesssim3$), for which the statistical uncertainty\nis sample variance dominated. We address the observational requirements on the\nangular resolution, the field-of-view, and the thermal noise limit for a\nsuccessful measurement. To achieve a full scientific return from 21-cm\ntomography and to exploit a synergy with 21-cm power spectra, we suggest an\nobserving strategy using wide-field imaging (several tens of square degrees) by\nan interferometric mosaicking/multi-beam observation with additional\nintermediate baselines (~2-4 km).\n", "  We study the spin-relaxation time in materials where a large spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) is present which breaks the spatial inversion symmetry. Such a\nspin-orbit coupling is realized in zincblende structures and heterostructures\nwith a transversal electric field and the spin relaxation is usually described\nby the so-called D'yakonov-Perel' (DP) mechanism. We combine a Monte Carlo\nmethod and diagrammatic calculation based approaches in our study; the former\ntracks the time evolution of electron spins in a quasiparticle dynamics\nsimulation in the presence of the built-in spin-orbit magnetic fields and the\nlatter builds on the spin-diffusion propagator by Burkov and Balents [Burkov\nand Balents Phys. Rev. B. 69, 245312 (2004).]. Remarkably, we find a parameter\nfree quantitative agreement between the two approaches and it also returns the\nconventional result of the DP mechanism in the appropriate limit. We discuss\nthe full phase space of spin relaxation as a function of SOC strength, its\ndistribution, and the magnitude of the momentum relaxation rate. This allows us\nto identify two novel spin-relaxation regimes; where spin relaxation is\nstrongly non-exponential and the spin relaxation equals the momentum\nrelaxation. A compelling analogy between the spin-relaxation theory and the NMR\nmotional narrowing is highlighted.\n", "  The inner structure of neutron stars is still an open question. To make\nprogress and understand the qualitative impact of gauge interactions on the\nneutron star structure we study neutron stars in a modified version of QCD. In\nthis modification the gauge group of QCD is replaced by the exceptional Lie\ngroup G$_2$, which has neutrons and is accessible at finite density in lattice\ncalculations. Using an equation of state constructed from lattice calculations\nwe determine the mass-radius-relation for a neutron star in this theory using\nthe Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. The results exhibit an influence of\nthe non-trivial interactions on the mass-radius relation. However, the masses\nof the quarks are found to have little influence. We also give density profiles\nand the phase structure inside the neutron star. If the results carry over to\nfull QCD, much of the internal structure of neutron stars could already be\ninferred from a precise measurement of the mass-radius relation.\n", "  Biomolecular machines consume free energy to break symmetry and make directed\nprogress. Nonequilibrium ATP concentrations are the typical free energy source,\nwith one cycle of a molecular machine consuming a certain number of ATP,\nproviding a fixed free energy budget. Since evolution is expected to favor\nrapid-turnover machines that operate efficiently, we investigate how this free\nenergy budget can be allocated to maximize flux. Unconstrained optimization\neliminates intermediate metastable states, indicating that flux is enhanced in\nmolecular machines with fewer states. When maintaining a set number of states,\nwe show that---in contrast to previous findings---the flux-maximizing\nallocation of dissipation is not even. This result is consistent with the\ncoexistence of both `irreversible' and reversible transitions in molecular\nmachine models that successfully describe experimental data, which suggests\nthat in evolved machines different transitions differ significantly in their\ndissipation.\n", "  Almost a decade has passed since the serendipitous discovery of the\niron-based high temperature superconductors (FeSCs) in 2008. The question of\nhow much similarity the FeSCs have with the copper oxide high temperature\nsuperconductors emerged since the initial discovery of long-range\nantiferromagnetism in the FeSCs in proximity to superconductivity. Despite the\ngreat resemblance in their phase diagrams, there exist important disparities\nbetween FeSCs and cuprates that need to be considered in order to paint a full\npicture of these two families of high temperature superconductors. One of the\nkey differences lies in the multi-orbital multi-band nature of FeSCs, in\ncontrast to the effective single-band model for cuprates. Due to the complexity\nof multi-orbital band structures, the orbital degree of freedom is often\nneglected in formulating the theoretical models for FeSCs. On the experimental\nside, systematic studies of the orbital related phenomena in FeSCs have been\nlargely lacking. In this review, we summarize angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) measurements across various FeSC families in literature,\nfocusing on the systematic trend of orbital dependent electron correlations and\nthe role of different Fe 3d orbitals in driving the nematic transition, the\nspin-density-wave transition, and implications for superconductivity.\n", "  Difficult problems described in terms of interacting quantum fields evolving\nin real time or out of equilibrium are abound in condensed-matter and\nhigh-energy physics. Addressing such problems via controlled experiments in\natomic, molecular, and optical physics would be a breakthrough in the field of\nquantum simulations. In this work, we present a quantum-sensing protocol to\nmeasure the generating functional of an interacting quantum field theory and,\nwith it, all the relevant information about its in or out of equilibrium\nphenomena. Our protocol can be understood as a collective interferometric\nscheme based on a generalization of the notion of Schwinger sources in quantum\nfield theories, which make it possible to probe the generating functional. We\nshow that our scheme can be realized in crystals of trapped ions acting as\nanalog quantum simulators of self-interacting scalar quantum field theories.\n", "  We report on experiments addressing the non-linear interaction between a\nnano-mechanical mode and position fluctuations. The Duffing non-linearity\ntransduces the Brownian motion of the mode, and of other non-linearly coupled\nones, into frequency noise. This mechanism, ubiquitous to all weakly-nonlinear\nresonators thermalized to a bath, results in a phase diffusion process altering\nthe motion: two limit behaviors appear, analogous to motional narrowing and\ninhomogeneous broadening in NMR. Their crossover is found to depend\nnon-trivially on the ratio of the frequency noise correlation time to its\nmagnitude. Our measurements obtained over an unprecedented range covering the\ntwo limits match the theory of Y. Zhang and M. I. Dykman, Phys. Rev. B 92,\n165419 (2015), with no free parameters. We finally discuss the fundamental\nbound on frequency resolution set by this mechanism, which is not marginal for\nbottom-up nanostructures.\n", "  We have determined the magnetic properties of epitaxially grown Dy islands on\ngraphene/SiC(0001) that are passivated by a gold film (deposited in the\nultra-high vacuum growth chamber) for {\\it ex-situ} X-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism (XMCD). Our sum-rule analysis of the Dy $M_{4,5}$ XMCD spectra at low\ntemperatures ($T=15$ K) as a function of magnetic field assuming Dy$^{3+}$\n(spin configuration $^6H_{15/2}$) indicate that the projection of the magnetic\nmoment along an applied magnetic field of 5 T is 3.5(3) $\\mu_B$. Temperature\ndependence of the magnetic moment (extracted from the $M_5$ XMCD spectra) shows\nan onset of a change in magnetic moment at about 175 K in proximity of the\ntransition from paramagnetic to helical magnetic structure at $T_{\\rm H} =179$\nK in bulk Dy. No feature at the vicinity of the ferromagnetic transition of hcp\nbulk Dy at $T_{\\rm c}$ = 88 K is observed. However, below $\\sim$130 K, the\ninverse magnetic moment (extracted from the XMCD) is linear in temperature as\ncommonly expected from a paramagnetic system suggesting different behavior of\nDy nano-island than bulk Dy.\n", "  We study the long-time decay of fourth-order electron spin correlation\nfunctions for an isolated singly charged semi-conductor quantum dot. The\nelectron spin dynamics is governed by the applied external magnetic field as\nwell as the hyperfine interaction. While the long-time coherent oscillations in\nthe correlation functions can be understood within an semi-classical approach\ntreating the Overhauser field as frozen, the field dependent decay of its\namplitude reported in different experiments cannot be explained by the\ncentral-spin model indicating the insufficiency of such a description. By\nincorporating the nuclear Zeeman splitting and the strain induced\nnuclear-electric quadrupolar interaction, we find the correct crossover from a\nfast decay in small magnetic fields to a slow exponential asymptotic in large\nmagnetic fields. It originates from a competition between the quadrupolar\ninteraction inducing an enhanced spin decay and the nuclear Zeeman term that\nsuppressed the spin-flip processes. We are able to explain the magnetic field\ndependency of the characteristic long-time decay time $T_2$ depending on the\nexperimental setups. The calculated asymptotic values of $T_2 = 3 -4\\,\\mu$s\nagree qualitatively well with the experimental data.\n", "  Results are reported from a search for supersymmetric particles in\nproton-proton collisions in the final state with a single lepton; multiple\njets, including at least one b-tagged jet; and large missing transverse\nmomentum. The search uses a sample of proton-proton collision data at sqrt(s) =\n13 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 35.9 inverse femtobarns. The observed event yields in\nthe signal regions are consistent with those expected from standard model\nbackgrounds. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified models of\nsupersymmetry involving gluino pair production, with gluino decay into either\non- or off-mass-shell top squarks. Assuming that the top squarks decay into a\ntop quark plus a stable, weakly interacting neutralino, scenarios with gluino\nmasses up to about 1.9 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for neutralino\nmasses up to about 1 TeV.\n", "  Thermal fluctuations can lift the degeneracy of a ground state manifold,\nproducing a free energy landscape without accidentally degenerate minima. In a\nprocess known as order by disorder, a subset of states incorporating\nsymmetry-breaking may be selected. Here, we show that such a free energy\nlandscape can be controlled in a non-equilibrium setting as the slow motion\nwithin the ground state manifold is governed by the fast modes out of it. For\nthe paradigmatic case of the classical pyrochlore XY antiferromagnet, we show\nthat a uniform magnetic field pulse can excite these fast modes to generate a\ntunable effective free energy landscape with minima at thermodynamically\nunstable portions of the ground state manifold.\n", "  We describe a notion of \"higher\" Wess-Zumino-Witten-like action which is\nnatural in the context of superstring field theories formulated in the large\nHilbert space. For the open string, the action is characterized by a pair of\ncommuting cyclic $A_\\infty$ structures together with a hierarchy of higher-form\npotentials analogous to the Maurer-Cartan elements which appear in the\nconventional Wess-Zumino-Witten action. We apply this formalism to get a better\nunderstanding of symmetries of open superstring field theory and the structure\nof interactions in the Ramond sector, describing an interesting connection\nbetween Ramond vertices and Feynman diagrams.\n", "  We present the results of a multiwavelength investigation of the very X-ray\nluminous galaxy cluster MACSJ0553.4-3342 ($z = 0.4270$; hereafter MACSJ0553).\nCombining high-resolution data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and the\nChandra X-ray Observatory with ground-based galaxy spectroscopy, our analysis\nestablishes the system unambiguously as a binary, post-collision merger of\nmassive clusters. Key characteristics include perfect alignment of luminous and\ndark matter for one component, a separation of almost 650 kpc (in projection)\nbetween the dark-matter peak of the other subcluster and the second X-ray peak,\nextremely hot gas (k$T > 15$ keV) at either end of the merger axis, a potential\ncold front in the east, an unusually low gas mass fraction of approximately\n0.075 for the western component, a velocity dispersion of $1490_{-130}^{+104}$\nkm s$^{-1}$, and no indication of significant substructure along the line of\nsight. We propose that the MACSJ0553 merger proceeds not in the plane of the\nsky, but at a large inclination angle, is observed very close to turnaround,\nand that the eastern X-ray peak is the cool core of the slightly less massive\nwestern component that was fully stripped and captured by the eastern\nsubcluster during the collision. If correct, this hypothesis would make\nMACSJ0553 a superb target for a competitive study of ram-pressure stripping and\nthe collisional behaviour of luminous and dark matter during cluster formation.\n", "  Quantum statistics have a profound impact on the properties of systems\ncomposed of identical particles. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the\nquantum statistics of a pair of identical massive particles can be probed by a\ndirect measurement of the exchange symmetry of their wave function even in\nconditions where the particles always remain spatially well separated and thus\nthe exchange contribution to their interaction energy is negligible. We present\ntwo protocols revealing the bosonic or fermionic nature of a pair of particles\nand discuss possible implementations with a pair of trapped atoms or ions.\n", "  We present a complete set of exact and fully non-linear equations describing\nall three types of cosmological perturbations -- scalar, vector and tensor\nperturbations. We derive the equations in a thoroughly gauge-ready manner, so\nthat any spatial and temporal gauge conditions can be employed. The equations\nare completely general without any physical restriction except that we assume a\nflat homogeneous and isotropic universe as a background. We also comment\nbriefly on the application of our formulation to the non-expanding Minkowski\nbackground.\n", "  The stationary states of nonlinear Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation on a ring with a\ndefect is numerically analyzed. Unconventional connection conditions are\nimposed on the point defect, and it is shown that the system displays energy\nlevel crossings and level shifts and associated quantum holonomies in the space\nof system parameters, just as in the corresponding linear system. In the space\nof nonlinearity parameter, on the other hand, the degeneracy occurs on a line,\nexcluding the possibility of any anholonomies. In contrast to the linear case,\nexistence of exotic phenomena such as disappearance of energy level and\nfoam-like structure are confirmed.\n", "  Inspired by recent experiments, we study a short superconducting junction of\nlength $L\\ll \\xi$ (coherence length) inserted in a dc-SQUID containing an\nancillary Josephson tunnel junction. We evaluate the nonequilibrium occupation\nof the Andreev bound states (ABS) for the case of a conventional junction and a\ntopological junction, with the latter case of ABS corresponding to a Majorana\nmode. We take into account small phase fluctuations of the Josephson tunnel\njunction, acting as a damped LC resonator, and analyze the role of the\ndistribution of the quasiparticles of the continuum assuming that these\nquasiparticles are in thermal distribution with an effective temperature\ndifferent from the environmental temperature. We also discuss the effect of\nstrong photon irradiation in the junction leading to a nonequilibrium\noccupation of the ABS. We systematically compare the occupations of the bound\nstates and the supercurrents carried by these states for conventional and\ntopological junctions.\n", "  We present a review of data types and statistical methods often encountered\nin astronomy. The aim is to provide an introduction to statistical applications\nin astronomy for statisticians and computer scientists. We highlight the\ncomplex, often hierarchical, nature of many astronomy inference problems and\nadvocate for cross-disciplinary collaborations to address these challenges.\n", "  We study the possibility of an ultraviolet (UV) zero in the six-loop beta\nfunction of an O($N$) $\\lambda |\\vec \\phi|^4$ field theory in $d=4$ spacetime\ndimensions. For general $N$, in the range of values of $\\lambda$ where a\nperturbative calculation is reliable, we find evidence against such a UV zero\nin this six-loop beta function.\n", "  Open-system approaches are gaining traction in the simulation of charge\ntransport in nanoscale and molecular electronic devices. In particular,\n\"extended reservoir\" simulations, where explicit reservoir degrees of freedom\nare present, allow for the computation of both real-time and steady-state\nproperties but require relaxation of the extended reservoirs. The strength of\nthis relaxation, $\\gamma$, influences the conductance, giving rise to a\n\"turnover\" behavior analogous to Kramers' turnover in chemical reaction rates.\nWe derive explicit, general expressions for the weak and strong relaxation\nlimits. For weak relaxation, the conductance increases linearly with $\\gamma$\nand every electronic state of the total explicit system contributes to the\nelectronic current according to its \"reduced\" weight in the two extended\nreservoir regions. Essentially, this represents two conductors in series -- one\nat each interface with the implicit reservoirs that provide the relaxation. For\nstrong relaxation, a \"dual\" expression -- one with the same functional form --\nresults, except now proportional to $1/\\gamma$ and dependent on the system of\ninterest's electronic states, reflecting that the strong relaxation is\nlocalizing electrons in the extended reservoirs. Higher order behavior (e.g.,\n$\\gamma^2$ or $1/\\gamma^2$) can occur when there is a gap in the frequency\nspectrum. Moreover, inhomogeneity in the frequency spacing can give rise to a\npseudo-plateau regime. These findings yield a physically motivated approach to\ndiagnosing numerical simulations and understanding the influence of relaxation,\nand we examine their occurrence in both simple models and a realistic,\nfluctuating graphene nanoribbon.\n", "  EPR steering is an asymmetric form of correlations which is intermediate\nbetween quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality, and can be exploited for\nquantum communication with one untrusted party. In particular, steering of\ncontinuous variable Gaussian states has been extensively studied as a\nmanifestation of the EPR paradox. While most of these studies focused on\nquadrature measurements for steering detection, two recent works revealed that\nthere exist Gaussian states which are only steerable by non-Gaussian\nmeasurements. In this paper we perform a systematic investigation of EPR\nsteering of bipartite Gaussian states by pseudospin measurements, complementing\nand extending previous findings. We first derive the density matrix elements of\ntwo-mode squeezed thermal states in the Fock basis, which may be of independent\ninterest. We then use such a representation to investigate steering of these\nstates as detected by a nonlinear criterion, based on second moments of the\npseudospin correlation matrix. This analysis reveals previously unexplored\nregimes where non-Gaussian measurements are more effective than Gaussian ones\nto witness steering of Gaussian states in the presence of local noise. We\nfurther consider an alternative set of pseudospin observables, whose\nexpectation value can be expressed compactly in terms of Wigner functions for\nall two-mode Gaussian states. However, according to the adopted criterion,\nthese observables are found to be always less sensitive than Gaussian\nobservables for steering detection. Finally, we investigate continuous variable\nWerner states, which are non-Gaussian mixtures of Gaussian states, and find\nthat pseudospin measurements are always more effective than Gaussian ones to\nreveal their steerability. Our results provide useful insights on the role of\nnon-Gaussian measurements in characterizing quantum correlations of Gaussian\nand non-Gaussian states.\n", "  The one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation with symmetric trigonometric\ndouble-well potential is exactly solved via angular prolate spheroidal\nfunction. Although it is inferior compared with multidimensional counterparts\nand its limitations are obvious nevertheless its solution is shown to be\nanalytic rather than commonly used numerical or approximate semiclassical (WKB)\none. This comprises the novelty and the merit of the present work. Our exact\nanalytic description of the ground state splitting can well be a referee point\nfor comparison of the accuracy of numerous WKB formulas suggested in the\nliterature. The approach reasonably well suits for the inversion mode in the\nammonia molecule $NH_3$ and thus yields a new theoretical tool for its\ndescription. The results obtained provide good quantitative description of\nrelevant experimental data on microwave and IR spectroscopy of $NH_3$.\n", "  To the naked eye, turbulent flows exhibit whirls of many different sizes. To\neach size, or scale, corresponds a fraction of the total energy resulting from\na cascade in five dimensions: scale, time and three-dimensional space.\nUnderstanding this process is critical to modeling strategies of geophysical\nand industrial flows. By tracking the flow regions containing energy in\ndifferent scales, we have evidenced the statistical predominance of a\ncross-scale link whereby fluid lumps of energy at scale $\\Delta$ appear within\nlumps of scale $2\\Delta$ and die within those of scale $\\Delta/2$. Our approach\nuncovers the energy cascade in a simple water-like fluid, offering new insights\nto turbulence models while paving the way to similar analysis in conducting\nfluids, quantum fluids and plasmas.\n", "  Strong spin-orbit coupling lifts the degeneracy of t2g orbitals in 5d\ntransition-metal systems, leaving a Kramers doublet and quartet with effective\nangular momentum of Jeff = 1/2 and 3/2, respectively. These spin-orbit\nentangled states can host exotic quantum phases such as topological Mott state,\nunconventional superconductivity, and quantum spin liquid. The lacunar spinel\nGaTa4Se8 was theoretically predicted to form the molecular Jeff = 3/2 ground\nstate. Experimental verification of its existence is an important first step to\nexploring the consequences of the Jeff = 3/2 state. Here, we report direct\nexperimental evidence of the Jeff = 3/2 state in GaTa4Se8 by means of\nexcitation spectra of resonant inelastic x-rays scattering at the Ta L3 and L2\nedges. We found that the excitations involving the Jeff = 1/2 molecular orbital\nwere suppressed only at the Ta L2 edge, manifesting the realization of the\nmolecular Jeff = 3/2 ground state in GaTa4Se8.\n", "  We test a data-driven approach based on QCD factorization for charmless\nthree-body $B$-decays by confronting it to measurements of CP violation in $B^-\n\\to \\pi^- \\pi^+ \\pi^-$. While some of the needed non-perturbative objects can\nbe directly extracted from data, some others can, so far, only be modelled.\nAlthough this approach is currently model dependent, we comment on the\nperspectives to reduce this model dependence. While our model naturally\naccommodates the gross features of the Dalitz distribution, it cannot\nquantitatively explain the details seen in the current experimental data on\nlocal CP asymmetries. We comment on possible refinements of our simple model\nand conclude by briefly discussing a possible extension of the model to large\ninvariant masses, where large local CP asymmetries have been measured.\n", "  Recent developments on intense laser sources is opening a new field of\noptical sciences. An intense coherent light beam strongly interacting with the\nmatter causes a coherent motion of a particle, forming a strongly dressed\nexcited particle. A photon emission from this dressed excited particle is a\nstrong nonlinear process causing high-harmonic generation(HHG), where the\nperturbation analysis is broken down. In this work, we study a coherent photon\nemission from a strongly dressed excited atom in terms of complex spectral\nanalysis in the extended Floquet-Hilbert-space. We have obtained the\neigenstates of the total Hamiltonian with use of Feshbach-Brilloiun-Wigner\nprojection method. In this extended space, the eigenstates of the total\nHamiltonian consisting of the radiation field and the atom system have complex\neigenvalues whose imaginary part represents the decay rate. Time evolution of\nthe system is represented by the complex eigenvector expansion so that the\ncorrelation dynamics between the photon and the atom is fully taken into\naccount. The HHG is interpreted as the irreversible spontaneous photon emission\ndue to the resonance singularity in terms of the multiple Floquet states that\nare generated by periodic external field. We have found that the interference\nbetween the emitted photons over the different Floquet states causes spatial\npulse emission correlated with the decay process of the excited atom.\n", "  Entanglement is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics, and is a primary\nresource in quantum information systems. Its manipulation remains a central\nchallenge in the development of quantum technology. In this work, we\ndemonstrate a device which can generate, manipulate, and analyse two-qubit\nentangled states, using miniature and mass-manufacturable silicon photonics. By\ncombining four photon-pair sources with a reconfigurable six-mode\ninterferometer, embedding a switchable entangling gate, we generate two-qubit\nentangled states, manipulate their entanglement, and analyse them, all in the\nsame silicon chip. Using quantum state tomography, we show how our source can\nproduce a range of entangled and separable states, and how our switchable\ncontrolled-Z gate operates on them, entangling them or making them separable\ndepending on its configuration.\n", "  It is demonstrated that the magic three-qubit Veldkamp line occurs naturally\nwithin the Veldkamp space of combinatorial Grassmannian of type $G_2(7)$,\n$\\mathcal{V}(G_2(7))$. The lines of the ambient symplectic polar space are\nthose lines of $\\mathcal{V}(G_2(7))$ whose cores feature an odd number of\npoints of $G_2(7)$. After introducing basic properties of three different types\nof points and six distinct types of lines of $\\mathcal{V}(G_2(7))$, we\nexplicitly show the combinatorial Grassmannian composition of the magic\nVeldkamp line; we first give representatives of points and lines of its core\ngeneralized quadrangle GQ$(2,2)$, and then additional points and lines of a\nspecific elliptic quadric $\\mathcal{Q}^{-}$(5,2), a hyperbolic quadric\n$\\mathcal{Q}^{+}$(5,2) and a quadratic cone $\\widehat{\\mathcal{Q}}$(4,2) that\nare centered on the GQ$(2,2)$. In particular, each point of\n$\\mathcal{Q}^{+}$(5,2) is represented by a Pasch configuration and its\ncomplementary line, the (Schl\\\"afli) double-six of points in\n$\\mathcal{Q}^{-}$(5,2) comprise six Cayley-Salmon configurations and six\nDesargues configurations with their complementary points, and the remaining\nCayley-Salmon configuration stands for the vertex of\n$\\widehat{\\mathcal{Q}}$(4,2).\n", "  Classical ground states (global energy-minimizing configurations) of\nmany-particle systems are typically unique crystalline structures, implying\nzero enumeration entropy of distinct patterns (aside from trivial symmetry\noperations). By contrast, the few previously known disordered classical ground\nstates of many-particle systems are all high-entropy (highly degenerate)\nstates. Here we show computationally that our recently-proposed \"perfect-glass\"\nmany-particle model [Sci. Rep., 6, 36963 (2016)] possesses disordered classical\nground states with a zero entropy: a highly counterintuitive situation. For all\nof the system sizes, parameters, and space dimensions that we have numerically\ninvestigated, the disordered ground states are unique such that they can always\nbe superposed onto each other or their mirror image. At low energies, the\ndensity of states obtained from simulations matches those calculated from the\nharmonic approximation near a single ground state, further confirming\nground-state uniqueness. Our discovery provides singular examples in which\nentropy and disorder are at odds with one another. The zero-entropy ground\nstates provide a unique perspective on the celebrated Kauzmann-entropy crisis\nin which the extrapolated entropy of a supercooled liquid drops below that of\nthe crystal. We expect that our disordered unique patterns to be of value in\nfields beyond glass physics, including applications in cryptography as\npseudo-random functions with tunable computational complexity.\n", "  SiC based metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) have\ngained a significant importance in power electronics applications. However,\nelectrically active defects at the SiC/SiO$_2$ interface degrade the ideal\nbehavior of the devices. The relevant microscopic defects can be identified by\nelectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) or electrically detected magnetic\nresonance (EDMR). This helps to decide which changes to the fabrication process\nwill likely lead to further increases of device performance and reliability.\nEDMR measurements have shown very similar dominant hyperfine (HF) spectra in\ndifferently processed MOSFETs although some discrepancies were observed in the\nmeasured $g$-factors. Here, the HF spectra measured of different SiC MOSFETs\nare compared and it is argued that the same dominant defect is present in all\ndevices. A comparison of the data with simulated spectra of the C dangling bond\n(P$_\\textrm{bC}$) center and the silicon vacancy (V$_\\textrm{Si}$) demonstrates\nthat the P$_\\textrm{bC}$ center is a more suitable candidate to explain the\nobserved HF spectra.\n", "  $\\alpha$--cluster states in $^{46}$Cr and $^{54}$Cr are investigated in the\ndouble-folding model. This study complements a recent similar work of Souza and\nMiyake \\cite{Sou17} which was based on a specially shaped potential. Excitation\nenergies, reduced widths, intercluster separations, and intra-band transition\nstrengths are calculated and compared to experimental values for the ground\nstate bands in $^{46}$Cr and $^{54}$Cr. The $\\alpha$-cluster potential is also\napplied to elastic scattering at low and intermediate energies. Here, as a\nbyproduct, a larger radial extent of the neutron density in $^{50}$Ti is found.\n", "  The 2+1d Gross-Neveu model with finite density and finite temperature are\nstudied by the staggered fermion discretization. The kinetic part of this\nstaggered fermion in momentum space is used to build the relation between the\nstaggered fermion and Wilson-like fermion. In the large Nf limit (the number Nf\nof staggered fermion flavors), the chiral condensate and fermion density are\nsolved from the gap equation in momentum space, and thus the phase diagram of\nfermion coupling, temperature and chemical potential are obtained. Moreover, an\nanalytic formula for the inverse of the staggered fermion matrix are given\nexplicitly, which can be calculated easily by parallelization. The\ngeneralization to the 1+1d and 3+1d cases are also considered.\n", "  The polarisation of cells and tissues is fundamental for tissue morphogenesis\nduring biological development and regeneration. A deeper understanding of\nbiological polarity pattern formation can be gained from the consideration of\npattern reorganisation in response to an opposing instructive cue, which we\nhere consider by example of experimentally inducible body axis inversions in\nplanarian flatworms. Our dynamically diluted alignment model represents three\nprocesses: entrainment of cell polarity by a global signal, local cell-cell\ncoupling aligning polarity among neighbours and cell turnover inserting\ninitially unpolarised cells. We show that a persistent global orienting signal\ndetermines the final mean polarity orientation in this stochastic model.\nCombining numerical and analytical approaches, we find that neighbour coupling\nretards polarity pattern reorganisation, whereas cell turnover accelerates it.\nWe derive a formula for an effective neighbour coupling strength integrating\nboth effects and find that the time of polarity reorganisation depends linearly\non this effective parameter and no abrupt transitions are observed. This allows\nto determine neighbour coupling strengths from experimental observations. Our\nmodel is related to a dynamic $8$-Potts model with annealed site-dilution and\nmakes testable predictions regarding the polarisation of dynamic systems, such\nas the planarian epithelium.\n", "  We report Chandra observations of GW170817, the first neutron star-neutron\nstar merger discovered by the joint LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, and the first\ndirect detection of gravitational radiation associated with an electromagnetic\ncounterpart, Fermi short gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A. The event occurred on\n2017 August 17 and subsequent observations identified an optical counterpart,\nSSS17a, coincident with NGC 4993 (~10 arcsec separation). Early Chandra (\\Delta\nt ~ 2 days) and Swift (\\Delta t ~ 1-3 days) observations yielded non-detections\nat the optical position, but ~9 days post-trigger Chandra monitoring revealed\nan X-ray point source coincident with SSS17a. We present two deep Chandra\nobservations totaling ~95 ks, collected on 2017 September 01-02 (\\Delta t ~\n15-16 days). We detect X-ray emission from SSS17a with L_{0.3-10 keV} =\n2.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4} x 10^38 ergs, and a power law spectrum of Gamma = 2.4 +/-\n0.8. We find that the X-ray light curve from a binary NS coalescence associated\nwith this source is consistent with the afterglow from an off-axis short\ngamma-ray burst, with a jet angled >~23 deg from the line of sight. This event\nmarks both the first electromagnetic counterpart to a LIGO-Virgo\ngravitational-wave source and the first identification of an off-axis short\nGRB. We also confirm extended X-ray emission from NGC 4993 (L_{0.3-10 keV} ~ 9\nx 10^38 ergs) consistent with its E/S0 galaxy classification, and report two\nnew Chandra point sources in this field, CXOU J130948 and CXOU J130946.\n", "  We report a systematic study on Edelstein magnetoresistance (Edelstein MR) in\nCo25Fe75/Cu/Bi2O3 heterostructures with a strong spin-orbit interaction at the\nCu/Bi2O3 interface. We succeed in observing a significant dependence of the\nEdelstein MR on both Cu layer thickness and temperature, and also develop a\ngeneral analytical model considering distinct bulk and interface contributions\non spin relaxation. Our analysis, based on the above model, quantitatively\nillustrates a unique property of the spin transport near the Rashba interface,\nrevealing a prominent role of the spin relaxation process by determining the\nratios of the spin relaxation inside and outside the interface. We further find\nthe characteristic spin transport is unaffected by temperature. Our results\nprovide an essential tool for exploring the transport in a system with\nspin-momentum-locked two-dimensional states.\n", "  The particle spectrometer SONIC for particle-$\\gamma$ coincidence\nmeasurements was commissioned at the Institute for Nuclear Physics in Cologne,\nGermany. SONIC consists of up to 12 silicon $\\mathit{\\Delta}E$-$E$ telescopes\nwith a total solid angle coverage of 9%, and will complement HORUS, a\n$\\gamma$-ray spectrometer with 14 HPGe detectors. The combined setup\nSONIC@HORUS is used to investigate the $\\gamma$-decay behaviour of low-spin\nstates up to the neutron separation threshold excited by light-ion inelastic\nscattering and transfer reactions using beams provided by a 10 MV FN Tandem\naccelerator. The particle-$\\gamma$ coincidence method will be presented using\ndata from a $^{92}$Mo(p,p'$\\gamma$) experiment. In a $^{119}$Sn(d,X)\nexperiment, excellent particle identification has been achieved because of the\ngood energy resolution of the silicon detectors of approximately 20 keV. Due to\nthe non-negligible momentum transfer in the reaction, a Doppler correction of\nthe detected $\\gamma$-ray energy has to be performed, using the additional\ninformation from measuring the ejectile energy and direction. The high\nsensitivity of the setup is demonstrated by the results from a\n$^{94}$Mo(p,p'$\\gamma$) experiment, where small $\\gamma$-decay branching ratios\nhave been deduced.\n", "  We review the recent results on development of vector models of spin and\napply them to study the influence of spin-field interaction on the trajectory\nand precession of a spinning particle in external gravitational and\nelectromagnetic fields. The formalism is developed starting from the Lagrangian\nvariational problem, which implies both equations of motion and constraints\nwhich should be presented in a model of spinning particle. We present a\ndetailed analysis of the resulting theory and show that it has reasonable\nproperties on both classical and quantum level. We describe a number of\napplications and show how the vector model clarifies some issues presented in\ntheoretical description of a relativistic spin: A) One-particle relativistic\nquantum mechanics with positive energies and its relation with the Dirac\nequation and with relativistic {\\it Zitterbewegung}; B) Spin-induced non\ncommutativity and the problem of covariant formalism; C) Three-dimensional\nacceleration consistent with coordinate-independence of the speed of light in\ngeneral relativity and rainbow geometry seen by spinning particle; D)\nParadoxical behavior of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon equations of a\nrotating body in ultra relativistic limit, and equations with improved\nbehavior.\n", "  Micron-thick boron films have been deposited by Pulsed Laser Deposition in\nvacuum on several substrates at room temperature. The use of high energy pulses\n(>700 mJ) results in the deposition of smooth coatings with low oxygen uptake\neven at base pressures of 10$^{-4}$ - 10$^{-3}$ Pa. A detailed structural\nanalysis, by X-Ray Diffraction and Raman, allowed to assess the amorphous\nnature of the deposited films as well as to determine the base pressure that\nprevents boron oxide formation. In addition the crystallization dynamics has\nbeen characterized showing that film crystallinity already improves at\nrelatively low temperatures (800 {\\deg}C). Elastic properties of the boron\nfilms have been determined by Brillouin spectroscopy. Finally, micro-hardness\ntests have been used to explore cohesion and hardness of B films deposited on\naluminum, silicon and alumina. The reported deposition strategy allows the\ngrowth of reliable boron coatings paving the way for their use in many\ntechnology fields.\n", "  The search for a theory of quantum gravity is the most fundamental problem in\nall of theoretical physics, but there are as yet no experimental results at all\nto guide this endeavor. What seems to be needed is a pragmatic way to test if\ngravitation really occurs between quantum objects or not. In this article we\nsuggest such a potential way out of this deadlock, utilizing macroscopic\nquantum systems; superfluid helium, gaseous Bose-Einstein condensates and\n\"macroscopic\" molecules. It turns out that true quantum gravity effects - here\ndefined as observable gravitational interactions between truly quantum objects\n- could and should be seen (if they occur in nature) using existing technology.\nA falsification of the low-energy limit, in the accessible weak-field regime,\nwould also falsify the full theory of quantum gravity, making it enter the\nrealm of testable, potentially falsifiable theories, i.e. becoming real physics\nafter almost a century of pure theorizing. If weak-field gravity between\nquantum objects is shown to be absent (in the regime where the approximation\nshould apply), we know that gravity then is a strictly classical phenomenon\nabsent at the quantum level.\n", "  In this paper, we have investigated late time acceleration for a spatially\nflat dust filled Universe in Brans-Dicke theory in the presence of a positive\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ . Expressions for Hubble's constant, luminosity\ndistance and apparent magnitude have been obtained for our model. The\ntheoretical results are compared with the observed values of the the latest 287\nhigh red shift ($ .3 \\leq z \\leq 1.4$ ) SN Ia supernova data's taken from Union\n2.1 compilation to estimate the present values of the matter and dark energy\nparameters $(\\Omega_{m})_0$ and $(\\Omega_{\\Lambda})_0$. We have also estimated\nthe present value of Hubble's constant $H_0$ in the light of a updated sample\nof Hubble parameter measurements including 19 independent data points. The\nresults are found to be in good agreement with recent astrophysical\nobservations. We have also calculated various physical parameters such as the\nmatter and dark energy densities, the present age of the universe and\ndeceleration parameter. The value for BD-coupling constant $\\omega$ is set to\nbe 40000 on the basis of accuracy of the solar system tests and recent\nexperimental evidence.\n", "  To investigate the effects of CdCl$_2$ treatment on the local electronic\nproperties of polycrystalline CdTe films, we conducted a photoemission electron\nmicroscopy (PEEM) study of polished surfaces of CdTe films in superstrate\nconfiguration, with and without CdCl$_2$ treatment. From photoemission\nintensity images, we observed the tendency for individual exposed grain\ninteriors to vary in photoemission intensity, regardless of whether or not\nfilms received CdCl$_2$ treatment. Additionally, grain boundaries develop\ncontrast in photoemission intensity images different from grain interiors after\nan air exposure step, similar to observations of activated grain boundaries\nusing scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy studies. These results suggest\nthat work function varies locally, from one grain interior to another, as well\nas between grain boundaries and grain interiors.\n", "  Increasing proton beam power on neutrino production targets is one of the\nmajor goals of the Fermilab long term accelerator programs. In this effort, the\nFermilab 8 GeV Booster synchrotron plays a critical role for at least the next\ntwo decades. Therefore, understanding the Booster in great detail is important\nas we continue to improve its performance. For example, it is important to know\naccurately the available RF power in the Booster by carrying out beam-based\nmeasurements in order to specify the needed upgrades to the Booster RF system.\nSince the Booster magnetic field is changing continuously measuring/calibrating\nthe RF voltage is not a trivial task. Here, we present a beam based method for\nthe RF voltage measurements. Data analysis is carried out using computer\nprograms developed in Python and MATLAB. The method presented here is\napplicable to any RCS which do not have flat-bottom and flat-top in the\nacceleration magnetic ramps. We have also carried out longitudinal beam\ntomography at injection and extraction energies with the data used for RF\nvoltage measurements. Beam based RF voltage measurements and beam tomography\nwere never done before for the Fermilab Booster. The results from these\ninvestigations will be very useful in future intensity upgrades.\n", "  We numerically investigate the possibility of using Tunnel field-effect\ntransistor (TFET) in a 32 kHz crystal oscillator circuit to reduce power\nconsumption. A simulation using SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated\nCircuit Emphasis) is carried out based on a conventional CMOS transistor model.\nIt is shown that the power consumption of TFET is one-tenth that of\nconventional low-power CMOS.\n", "  It has been proposed to determine the mass hierarchy of neutrinos by\nexploiting the beat between the oscillation frequencies corresponding to the\ntwo neutrino mass squared differences. JUNO is based on this concept and uses a\nlarge liquid scintillator detector at a distance of 53km from a powerful\nnuclear reactor complex. We argue that the micro-structure present in\nantineutrino fluxes from nuclear reactors makes it essential to experimentally\ndetermine a reference spectrum with an energy resolution very similar to the\none of JUNO.\n", "  Students at Colorado College and cadets at the US Air Force Academy have\nconducted an experimental test of gravitational time dilation. This\nrelativistic effect, highlighted in the movie Interstellar, causes clocks to\ntick more slowly near massive objects. A measurement of gravitational time\ndilation was made by comparing signals generated by a GPS frequency standard,\nwhich is based on sea-level time, to a cesium-beam frequency standard located\nat three different elevations above sea level. The effect is small but\nobservable; for the highest elevation studied (4302 m on the summit of Pikes\nPeak), a local clock ticks only 41 ns/day faster than a sea-level clock. Our\nresults are consistent with the predictions of general relativity. We also\ndiscuss implications of gravitational time dilation on GPS operations.\n", "  There is growing interest in high-energy astrophysics community for the\ndevelopment of sensitive instruments in the hard X-ray energy extending to few\nhundred keV. This requires position sensitive detector modules with high\nefficiency in the hard X-ray energy range. Here, we present development of a\ndetector module, which consists of 25 mm x 25 mm CeBr3 scintillation detector,\nread out by a custom designed two dimensional array of Silicon\nPhoto-Multipliers (SiPM). Readout of common cathode of SiPMs provides the\nspectral measurement whereas the readout of individual SiPM anodes provides\nmeasurement of interaction position in the crystal. Preliminary results for\nspectral and position measurements with the detector module are presented here.\n", "  The gene silencing effect of short interfering RNA (siRNA) is known to vary\nstrongly with the targeted position of the mRNA. A number of hypotheses have\nbeen suggested to explain this phenomenon. We would like to test if this\npositional effect is mainly due to the secondary structure of the mRNA at the\ntarget site. We proposed that this structural factor can be characterized by a\nsingle parameter called \"the hydrogen bond (H-b) index\", which represents the\naverage number of hydrogen bonds formed between nucleotides in the target\nregion and the rest of the mRNA. This index can be determined using a\ncomputational approach. We tested the correlation between the H-b index and the\ngene-silencing effects on three genes (Bcl-2, hTF and cyclin B1) using a\nvariety of siRNAs. We found that the gene-silencing effect is inversely\ndependent on the H-b index, indicating that the local mRNA structure at the\ntargeted site is the main cause of the positional effect. Based on this\nfinding, we suggest that the H-b index can be a useful guideline for future\nsiRNA design.\n", "  The paper presents the implementation of algorithms for automatic search for\nsignals scattered at meteor tracks based on the ISTP SB RAS EKB radar data. The\nalgorithm is divided into two phases - the detection of a meteoric echo and the\ndetermination of its parameters. In general, the algorithm is similar to the\nalgorithms used for specialized meteor radars, but uses direct fitting of\nreceived signal quadrature components by a model when finding the parameters of\nmeteor trail. Based on the analysis of maximum of the Geminid meteor shower\n13.12.2016 the aspect sensitivity of the scattered signals detected by the\nalgorithm was shown . This proves that the detected signals correspond to\nscattering by irregularities elongated with the direction to the radiant of the\nmeteor shower. This also confirms that the source of signals detected by the\nalgorithm are meteor traces. In this paper, we solve the inverse problem of\nreconstructing the vector of the neutral wind velocity from the radar data by\nthe weighted least-squares technique. A comparison of the roses of horizontal\nneutral winds obtained in the model of two-dimensional (horizontal) wind and\nthree-dimensional wind is made. Their similarity is shown and expected\npredominance of the zonal component over the meridional one is shown too. The\nimplemented algorithm allows us to process the scattered signals in the real\ntime. The detection algorithm has started its continuous operation at the ISTP\nSB RAS EKB radar at the end of 2016.\n", "  In this note we explore the possible marginal deformations of general (0,2)\nnon-linear sigma-models, which arise as descriptions of the weakly-coupled\n(large radius) limits of four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}= 1$ compactifications of\nthe heterotic string, to lowest order in $\\alpha'$ and first order in conformal\nperturbation theory. The results shed light from the world-sheet perspective on\nthe classical moduli space of such compactifications. This is a contribution to\nthe proceedings of String-Math 2012.\n", "  By performing an orbital analysis within a Galactic model including a bar, we\nfound that it is plausible that the newly discovered stars that show enhanced\nAl and N accompanied by Mg underabundances may have formed in the outer halo,\nor were brought in by satellites field possibly accreted a long time ago.\nHowever, another subsample of three N- and Al-rich stars with Mg-deficiency are\nkinematically consistent with the inner stellar halo. A speculative scenario to\nexplain the origin of the atypical chemical composition of these stars in the\ninner halo is that they migrated to the inner stellar halo as unbound stars due\nto the mechanism of bar-induced resonant trapping.\n", "  We will develop a computational method (RegioSQM) for predicting the\nregioselectivity of CH functionalization reactions that can be used by\nsynthetic chemists who are not experts in computational chemistry through a\nsimple web interface (regiosqm.org). CH functionalization, i.e. replacing the\nhydrogen atom in a CH bond with another atom or molecule, is arguably single\nmost promising technique for increasing the efficiency of chemical synthesis,\nbut there are no generally applicable predictive tools that predict which CH\nbond is most reactive. RegioSQM uses semiempirical quantum chemistry methods to\npredict relative stabilities of reaction intermediates which correlates with\nreaction rate and our goal is to determine which quantum method and\nintermediate give the best result for each reaction type. Finally, we will\nexperimentally demonstrate how RegioSQM can be used to make the chemical\nsynthesis part of drug discovery more efficient.\n", "  The STAR collaboration at the RHIC facility has recently announced the\nexciting discovery of direct evidence for extremely large vorticity in the\nQuark-Gluon Plasma generated in peripheral collisions, seen in the form of\nglobal polarization of $\\Lambda$ and $\\bar{\\Lambda}$ hyperons. This prompts the\nquestion: does this vorticity have any effect on other observed phenomena, such\nas jet quenching? Using a simple gauge-gravity model, we suggest that such an\neffect may be detectable, in data from near-future experiments, as a reduction\nin the jet quenching parameter. This is predicted to be most prominent in\ncollisions corresponding to a narrow range of centralities around $10 \\%$. The\nrelative reduction (compared to collisions at zero or, alternatively, large\ncentrality) is predicted to behave in an unexpected and characteristic manner:\nthe model suggests that it is independent of the impact energy.\n", "  The paper explores the numerical stability and the computational efficiency\nof a direct method for unfolding the resolution function from the measurements\nof the neutron induced reactions. A detailed resolution function formalism is\nlaid out, followed by an overview of challenges present in a practical\nimplementation of the method. A special matrix storage scheme is developed in\norder to facilitate both the memory management of the resolution function\nmatrix, and to increase the computational efficiency of the matrix\nmultiplication and decomposition procedures. Due to its admirable computational\nproperties, a Cholesky decomposition is at the heart of the unfolding\nprocedure. With the smallest but necessary modification of the matrix to be\ndecomposed, the method is successfully applied to system of $10^5\\times10^5$.\nHowever, the amplification of the uncertainties during the direct inversion\nprocedures limits the applicability of the method to high-precision\nmeasurements of neutron induced reactions.\n", "  Molecular separation traditionnally relies on sieving processes across\npassive nanoporous membranes. Here we explore theoretically the concept of\nnon-equilibrium active sieving. We investigate a simple model for an active\nnoisy nanopore, where gating - in terms of size or charge - is externally\ndriven at a tunable frequency. Our analytical and numerical results unveil a\nrich sieving diagram in terms of the forced gating frequency. Unexpectedly, the\nseparation ability is strongly increased as compared to its passive (zero\nfrequency) counterpart. It points also to the possibility of tuning dynamically\nthe osmotic pressure. Active separation outperforms passive sieving and\nrepresents a promising avenue for advanced filtration.\n", "  We present the first calculation of the pion electromagnetic form factor at\nphysical light quark masses. This form factor parameterises the deviations from\nthe behaviour of a point-like particle when a photon hits the pion. These\ndeviations result from the internal structure of the pion and can thus be\ncalculated in QCD. We use three sets (different lattice spacings) of $n_f =\n2+1+1$ lattice configurations generated by the MILC collaboration. The Highly\nImproved Staggered Quark formalism (HISQ) is used for all of the sea and\nvalence quarks. Using lattice configurations with $u$/$d$ quark masses very\nclose to the physical value is a big advantage, as we avoid the chiral\nextrapolation. We study the shape of the vector ($f_+$) form factor in the\n$q^2$ range from $0$ to $-0.15$~GeV$^2$ and extract the mean square radius,\n$\\langle r^2_v\\rangle$. The shape of the vector form factor and the resulting\nradius is compared with experiment. We also discuss the scalar form factor and\nradius extracted from that, which is not directly accessible to experiment. We\nhave also calculated the contributions from the disconnected diagrams to the\nscalar form factor at small $q^2$ and discuss their impact on the scalar radius\n$\\langle r^2_s\\rangle$.\n", "  In an attempt to select stars that can host planets with characteristics\nsimilar to our own, we selected seven solar-type stars known to host planets in\nthe habitable zone and for which spectroscopic stellar parameters are\navailable. For these stars we estimated 'empirical' abundances of O, C, Mg and\nSi, which in turn we used to derive the iron and water mass fraction of the\nplanet building blocks with the use of the model presented in Santos et al.\n(2015). Our results show that if rocky planets orbit these stars they might\nhave significantly different compositions between themselves and different from\nthat of our Earth. However, for a meaningful comparison between the\ncompositional properties of exoplanets in the habitable zone and our own\nplanet, a far more sophisticated analysis (e.g. Dorn et al., 2017) of a large\nnumber of systems with precise mass and radius of planets, and accurate\nchemical abundances of the host stars. The work presented here is merely the\nfirst humble step in this direction.\n", "  It is suggested that the chemical abundance trend with the condensation\ntemperature, Tc , can be a signature of rocky planet formation or accretion.\nRecently, a strong Tc trend was reported in the Zetta Reticuli binary system\n(Saffe et al., 2016), where ${\\zeta}$2 Ret Ret shows a deficit of refractory\nelements relative to its companion (${\\zeta}$1 Ret). This depletion was\nexplained by the presence of a debris disk around ${\\zeta}$2 Ret. Later,\nAdibekyan et al. (2016b) confirmed the significance of the trend, however,\ncasted doubts on the interpretation proposed. Using three individual highest\nquality spectra for each star, they found that the Tc trends depend on the\nindividual spectra (three spectra of each star were used) used in the\nanalaysis. In the current work we re-evaluated the presence and variability of\nthe Tc trend in this system using a larger number of individual spectra. In\ntotal, 62 spectra of ${\\zeta}$2 Ret and 31 spectra of ${\\zeta}$1 Ret was used.\nOur results confirm the word of caution issued by Adibekyan et al. (2016b) that\nnonphysical factors can be at the root of the T c trends for the cases of\nindividual spectra.\n", "  Supernovae represent significant sources of dust in the interstellar medium.\nIn this work, deep far-infrared (FIR) observations of the Crab Nebula are\nstudied to provide a new and reliable constraint on the amount of dust present\nin this supernova remnant. Deep exposures between 70 and 500 $\\mu$m taken by\nPACS and SPIRE instruments on-board the Herschel Space Telescope, compiling all\nobservations of the nebula including PACS observing mode calibration, are\nrefined using advanced processing techniques, thus providing the most accurate\ndata ever generated by Herschel on the object. We carefully find the intrinsic\nflux of each image by masking the source and creating a 2D polynomial fit to\ndeduce the background emission. After subtracting the estimated non-thermal\nsynchrotron component, two modified blackbodies were found to best fit the\nremaining infrared continuum, the cold component with T$_c$ = 8.3 $\\pm$ 3.0 K\nand M$_d$ = 0.27 $\\pm$ 0.05 M$_{\\odot}$ and the warmer component with T$_w$ =\n27.2 $\\pm$ 1.3 K and M$_d$ = (1.3 $\\pm$ 0.4) $\\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We derive a non-perturbative, closed, analytic equation for the non-linear\npower spectrum of cosmic density fluctuations. This result is based on our\nkinetic field theory (KFT) of cosmic structure formation and on evaluating\nparticle interactions in the Born approximation. At redshift zero, relative\ndeviations between our analytic result and typical numerical results are ~ 15 %\non average up to wave numbers of k <= 10 h/Mpc. The theory underlying our\nanalytic equation is fully specified once the statistical properties of the\ninitial density and momentum fluctuations are set. It has no further adjustable\nparameters. Apart from this equation, our main result is that the\ncharacteristic non-linear deformations of the power spectrum at late cosmic\ntimes are determined by the initial momentum correlations and a partial\ncompensation between diffusion damping and particle interactions.\n", "  The Maxwell-Bloch dissipative equations describe laser dynamics. Under a\nsimple condition on the parameters there exist two time dependent first\nintegrals, that allow a nonstandard separation of variables in the equations.\nThat condition has a precise physical meaning. The separated differential\nequations lead naturally to simple conjectures on the asymptotic behavior of\nthe physical variables.\n", "  Motivated by the discovery of multiferroicity in the geometrically frustrated\ntriangular antiferromagnet CuCrO$_2$ below its N\\'eel temperature $T_N$, we\ninvestigate its magnetic and ferroelectric properties using ab initio\ncalculations and Monte Carlo simulations. Exchange interactions up to the third\nnearest neighbors in the $ab$ plane, inter-layer interaction and single ion\nanisotropy constants in CuCrO$_2$ are estimated by series of density functional\ntheory calculations. In particular, our results evidence a hard axis along the\n[110] direction due to the lattice distortion that takes place along this\ndirection below $T_N$. Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the system\npossesses a N\\'eel temperature $T_N\\approx27$ K very close to the ones reported\nexperimentally ($T_N = 24-26$ K). Also we show that the ground state is a\nproper-screw magnetic configuration with an incommensurate propagation vector\npointing along the [110] direction. Moreover, our work reports the emergence of\nspin helicity below $T_N$ which leads to ferroelectricity in the extended\ninverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya model. We confirm the electric control of spin\nhelicity by simulating $P$-$E$ hysteresis loops at various temperatures.\n", "  The Rovelli relational interpretation of quantum mechanics (RQM) is based on\nthe assumption according to which the notion of observer-independent state of a\nphysical system is to be rejected. In RQM the primary target of the theory is\nthe analysis of the whole network of relations that may establish among quantum\nsubsystems, and the shift to a relational perspective is supposed to address in\na satisfactory way the general problem of the interpretation of quantum\nmechanics. Here I argue, mainly through an analysis of the so called third\nperson problem, that it is far from clear what a relativization of states to\nobservers exactly achieves and in what sense such an approach really advances\nour understanding of the peculiar features of quantum phenomena: therefore, in\nthis respect, RQM still faces open problems.\n", "  In the lower solar atmosphere, the chromosphere is permeated by jets known as\nspicules, in which plasma is propelled at speeds of 50 to 150 kilometers per\nsecond into the corona. The origin of the spicules is poorly understood,\nalthough they are expected to play a role in heating the million-degree corona\nand are associated with Alfv\\'enic waves that help drive the solar wind. We\ncompare magnetohydrodynamic simulations of spicules with observations from the\nInterface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope.\nSpicules are shown to occur when magnetic tension is amplified and transported\nupward through interactions between ions and neutrals or ambipolar diffusion.\nThe tension is impulsively released to drive flows, heat plasma (through\nambipolar diffusion), and generate Alfv\\'enic waves.\n", "  The pairing interaction is one of the most important contribution of the\nresidual interaction and then, it is of major importance for the study of\nmany-body systems. One can get solutions of the pairing Hamiltonian throught\nthe Bardeen-Cooper-Schieffer (BCS) or the Lipkin-Nogami (LN) approximations\nbut, the pairing Hamiltonian admit exact solution worked out by Richardson.\nNuclei far away from the stability line have important correlations with the\ncontinuum part of the energy spectrum, due that the Fermi level is very close\nto the contiuum thershold. The correlations with the continuum can be included\nin the many-body description through the complex energy states, called Gamow\nstates. In this work we compare the approximates and exact solutions of the\npairing Hamiltonian in real and complex-energy representations. In the\napplication of this formulation to the symmetric Lipkin model, we found that\nthe LN solution is in a good agreement with the exact one; besides, the\nextension of the BCS solution to the complex energy plane gives solution even\nfor strength below the critical one, which is purely imaginary.\n", "  The Pierre Auger Observatory is a hybrid detector for cosmic rays with E >\n1EeV. From the gathered data we estimated the proton-proton cross-section at\nsqrt(s) = 55 TeV and tested other features of the hadronic interaction models,\nwhich use extrapolations from the LHC energy. The electromagnetic component,\ncarrying most of the energy of the shower, is precisely measured using\nfluorescence telescopes, while the hadronic back- bone of the shower is\nindirectly tested by measuring the muons arriving to the surface detector. The\nanalyses show that models fail to describe these two components consistently,\npredicting too few muons at the ground.\n", "  Motivated by the problem of jet-flap interaction noise, we study the tonal\ndynamics that occur when a sharp edge is placed in the hydrodynamic nearfield\nof an isothermal turbulent jet. We perform hydrodynamic and acoustic pressure\nmeasurements in order to characterise the tones as a function of Mach number\nand streamwise edge position. The distribution of spectral peaks observed, as a\nfunction of Mach number, cannot be explained using the usual edge-tone\nscenario, in which resonance is underpinned by coupling between\ndownstream-travelling Kelvin-Helmholtz wavepackets and upstream-travelling\nsound waves. We show, rather, that the strongest tones are due to coupling\nbetween the former and upstream-travelling jet modes recently studied by Towne\net al. (2017) and Schmidt et al. (2017). We also study the band-limited nature\nof the resonance, showing a high-frequency cut-off to be due to the frequency\ndependence of the upstream-travelling waves. At high Mach number these become\nevanescent above a certain frequency, whereas at low Mach number they become\nprogressively trapped with increasing frequency, a consequence of which is\ntheir not being reflected in the nozzle plane. Additionally, a weaker,\nlow-frequency, forced-resonance regime is identified that involves the same\nupstream travelling jet modes but that couple, in this instance, with\ndownstream-travelling sound waves. It is suggested that the existence of two\nresonance regimes may be due to the non-modal nature of wavepacket dynamics at\nlow-frequency.\n", "  Hyperbolic systems of PDEs can be solved to arbitrary orders of accuracy by\nusing the ADER Finite Volume method. These PDE systems may be non-conservative\nand non-homogeneous, and contain stiff source terms. ADER-FV requires a\nspatio-temporal polynomial reconstruction of the data in each spacetime cell,\nat each time step. This reconstruction is obtained as the root of a nonlinear\nsystem, resulting from the use of a Galerkin method. It was proved in Jackson\n[7] that for traditional choices of basis polynomials, the eigenvalues of\ncertain matrices appearing in these nonlinear systems are always 0, regardless\nof the number of spatial dimensions of the PDEs or the chosen order of accuracy\nof the ADER-FV method. This guarantees fast convergence to the Galerkin root\nfor certain classes of PDEs.\n  In Montecinos and Balsara [9] a new, more efficient class of basis\npolynomials for the one-dimensional ADER-FV method was presented. This new\nclass of basis polynomials, originally presented for conservative systems, is\nextended to multidimensional, non-conservative systems here, and the\ncorresponding property regarding the eigenvalues of the Galerkin matrices is\nproved.\n", "  We analyze methanol excitation in the absence of external radiation and\nconsider LTE methods for probing interstellar gas. We show that rotation\ndiagrams correctly estimate the gas kinetic temperature only if they are built\nfrom lines with the upper levels located in the same K-ladders, such as the\nJ_0-J_{-1}E lines at 157~GHz, the J_1-J_0E lines at 165~GHz or the J_2-J_1E\nlines at 25~GHz. The gas density should be no less than 10^7~cm^{-3}. Rotation\ndiagrams built from lines with different K values of the upper levels (2_K-1_K\nat 96~GHz, 3_K-2_K at 145~GHz, or 5_K-4_K at 241~GHz) significantly\nunderestimate the temperature but allow a density estimation. In addition, the\ndiagrams based on the 2_K-1_K lines make possible methanol column density\nestimates within a factor of about 2--5. We suggest that rotation diagrams\nshould be used in the following manner. First, one should build two rotation\ndiagrams, one from the lines at 96, 145, or 241~GHz, and another from the lines\nat 157, 165, or 25~GHz. The former diagram is used to estimate the gas density.\nIf the density is about 10^7~cm^{-3} or higher, the latter diagram reproduces\nthe temperature fairly well. If the density is around 10^6~cm^{-3}, the\ntemperature obtained from the latter diagram should be multiplied by a factor\nof 1.5--2. If the density is about 10^5~cm^{-3} or lower, then the latter\ndiagram yields a temperature that is lower than the kinetic temperature by a\nfactor of three or larger and should be used only as a lower limit on the\nkinetic temperature. Errors of methanol column density determined from the\nintegrated intensity of a single line may be larger than an order of magnitude\neven when the gas temperature is well-known. However, if the J_0-(J-1)_0E\nlines, as well as the J_1-(J-1)_1A^{+} or A^{-} lines are used, the relative\nerror of the column density proves to be no larger than several units.\n", "  Since the publication of 'Complex Contagions and the Weakness of Long Ties'\nin 2007, complex contagions have been studied across an enormous variety of\nsocial domains. In reviewing this decade of research, we discuss recent\nadvancements in applied studies of complex contagions, particularly in the\ndomains of health, innovation diffusion, social media, and politics. We also\ndiscuss how these empirical studies have spurred complementary advancements in\nthe theoretical modeling of contagions, which concern the effects of network\ntopology on diffusion, as well as the effects of individual-level attributes\nand thresholds. In synthesizing these developments, we suggest three main\ndirections for future research. The first concerns the study of how multiple\ncontagions interact within the same network and across networks, in what may be\ncalled an ecology of contagions. The second concerns the study of how the\nstructure of thresholds and their behavioral consequences can vary by\nindividual and social context. The third area concerns the roles of diversity\nand homophily in the dynamics of complex contagion, including both diversity of\ndemographic profiles among local peers, and the broader notion of structural\ndiversity within a network. Throughout this discussion, we make an effort to\nhighlight the theoretical and empirical opportunities that lie ahead.\n", "  We prove that at any inverse temperature $\\beta$ and on any transitive\namenable graph, the automorphism-invariant Gibbs states of the ferromagnetic\nIsing model are convex combinations of the plus and minus states. This is\nobtained for a general class of interactions, that is automorphism-invariant\nand irreducible coupling constants. The proof uses the random current\nrepresentation of the Ising model. The result is novel when the graph is not\n$\\mathbb{Z}^d$, or when the graph is $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ but endowed with\ninfinite-range interactions, or even $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with finite-range\ninteractions.\n  Among the corollaries of this result, we can list continuity of the\nmagnetization at any non-critical temperature, the differentiability of the\nfree energy, and the uniqueness of FK-Ising infinite-volume measures.\n", "  As there seems to be a large mass gap between the SM and new physics\nparticles, the EFT framework emerges as the natural approach for the analysis\nand interpretation of collider data. However, this large gap and the fact that\n(so far) all the measured interactions look pretty much SM-like does not imply\nthat the linear Higgs representation as a complex doublet $\\phi$ in the SMEFT\nis always appropriate. Although there is a wide class of SM extensions that\naccept this linear description, this realization does not always provide a good\nperturbative expansion. The HEFT and its organization according to a chiral\nexpansion cures these issues. Path integral functional methods allow one to\ncompute the corrections to the NLO effective action: at tree level, the heavy\nresonances only contribute to the $O(p^4)$ low-energy couplings (or higher)\naccording to a pattern that depends on their quantum numbers and is suppressed\nby their masses; at the one-loop level, all the new-physics corrections go to\nthe $O(p^4)$ effective action (or higher) and are suppressed by an intrinsic\nscale of the LO HEFT Lagrangian, which has been related in recent times with\nthe curvature of the manifold of scalar fields (being the SM its flat limit and\nhaving the HEFT effective action an expansion in the curvature). This two\nsuppression scales (resonance masses and non-linearity/curvature) compete at\nNLO and may, in principle, be very different/similar depending on the\nparticular BSM scenario and the observable at hand. Likewise, experiments do\nnot tell us yet whether $O(p^4)$ loops are essentially negligible or not, as it\nis shown with a couple of examples. In summary, the HEFT extends the range of\napplicability of the SMEFT, which, although justified for a pretty wide class\nof BSM scenarios, introduces a bias in the data analyses and does not provide\nthe most general EFT framework.\n", "  We derive global consistency condition for strongly coupled heterotic string\nin the presence of M5-branes. Its elliptic genus is interpretable as generating\nfunctional of anomaly polynomials and so, on anomaly-free vacua, the genus is\nboth holomorphic and modular invariant. In holomorphic basis, we identify the\nmodular properties by calculating the phase. By interpreting the refinement\nparameters as background curvature of tangent and vector bundles, we identify\nthe extended Bianchi identity for Kalb--Ramond field of heterotic M-theory in\nthe presence of arbitrary numbers of M5-branes.\n", "  Desert dust aerosols affect Earth's global energy balance through direct\ninteractions with radiation, and through indirect interactions with clouds and\necosystems. But the magnitudes of these effects are so uncertain that it\nremains unclear whether atmospheric dust has a net warming or cooling effect on\nglobal climate. Consequently, it is still uncertain whether large changes in\natmospheric dust loading over the past century have slowed or accelerated\nanthropogenic climate change, or what the effects of potential future changes\nin dust loading will be. Here we present an analysis of the size and abundance\nof dust aerosols to constrain the direct radiative effect of dust. Using\nobservational data on dust abundance, in situ measurements of dust optical\nproperties and size distribution, and climate and atmospheric chemical\ntransport model simulations of dust lifetime, we find that the dust found in\nthe atmosphere is substantially coarser than represented in current global\nclimate models. Since coarse dust warms climate, the global dust direct\nradiative effect is likely to be less cooling than the ~-0.4 W/m2 estimated by\nmodels in a current global aerosol model ensemble. Instead, we constrain the\ndust direct radiative effect to a range between -0.48 and +0.20 W/m2, which\nincludes the possibility that dust causes a net warming of the planet.\n", "  When one applies a type of non-Hermitian effect, constant imaginary vector\npotential, to disordered systems, delocalization is induced even in two or\nlower dimension. By using the non-Hermitian induced transition as a probe, We\npropose a new procedure of estimating localization in arbitrary-dimensional\nsystems. By examining numerically the two-dimensional non-Hermitian\ntight-biding model with onsite disorder, it is shown that the failure of\nabsorbing the non-Hermitian effect, namely the breakdown of the imaginary gauge\ntransformation, characterize the inverse localization length near the band\ncenter.\n"]}
