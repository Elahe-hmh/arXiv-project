entanglement through maximally entangled mixed states\nas defined by concurrence and linear entropy is studied. We show how the\nteleported entanglement depends on the quality of the quantum channel used, as\ndefined through its entanglement and mixedness, as well as the form of the\ntarget state to be teleported. We present new results based on the fidelity of\nthe teleported state as well as an experimental set-up that is immediately\nimplementable with currently available technology.\n", "  We study the typical entanglement properties of a system comprising two\nindependent qubit environments interacting via a shuttling ancilla. The initial\npreparation of the environments is modeled using random-matrix techniques. The\nentanglement measure used in our study is then averaged over many histories of\nrandomly prepared environmental states. Under a Heisenberg interaction model,\nthe average entanglement between the ancilla and one of the environments\nremains constant, regardless of the preparation of the latter and the details\nof the interaction. We also show that, upon suitable kinematic and dynamical\nchanges in the ancilla-environment subsystems, the entanglement-sharing\nstructure undergoes abrupt modifications associated with a change in the\nmultipartite entanglement class of the overall system's state. These results\nare invariant with respect to the randomized initial state of the environments.\n", "  I present a pedagogical survey of a variety of quantum phases of the Hubbard\nmodel. The honeycomb lattice model has a conformal field theory connecting the\nsemi-metal to the insulator with Neel order. States with fractionalized\nexcitations are linked to the deconfined phases of gauge theories. I also\nconsider the confining phases of such gauge theories, and show how Berry phases\nof monopoles induce valence bond solid order. The triangular lattice model can\ndisplay a metal-insulator transition from a Fermi liquid to a deconfined spin\nliquid, and I describe the theory of this transition. The bilayer triangular\nlattice is used to illustrate another compressible metallic phase, the\n`fractionalized Fermi liquid'. I make numerous connections of these phases and\ncritical points to the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular, I argue that two\nrecent holographic constructions connect respectively to the Fermi liquid and\nfractionalized Fermi liquid phases.\n", "  The accuracy of the Heller's derivative rule to calculate the numerical\nweights associated with discretized energy spectrum is enhanced by Broad's\nextension which adds (N-1) more interpolating points to the original N points.\nThe extension scheme is then used to show how to realize the rule without any\napproximation.\n", "  This paper is devoted to description of the relationship among oriented\nassociativity equations, symmetry consistent conjugate curvilinear coordinate\nnets, and the widest associated class of semi- Hamiltonian hydrodynamic-type\nsystems.\n", "  Using generalised geometry we study the action of U-duality acting in three\nand four dimensions on the bosonic fields of eleven dimensional supergravity.\nWe compare the U-duality symmetry with the T-duality symmetry of double field\ntheory and see how the $SL(2)\\otimes SL(3)$ and SL(5) U-duality groups reduce\nto the SO(2,2) and SO(3,3) T-duality symmetry groups of the type IIA theory. As\nexamples we dualise M2-branes, both black and extreme. We find that uncharged\nblack M2-branes become charged under U-duality, generalising the Harrison\ntransformation, while extreme M2-branes will become new extreme M2-branes. The\nresulting tension and charges are quantised appropriately if we use the\ndiscrete U-duality group $E_d(Z)$.\n", "  We consider a linear Hamiltonian system consisting of a classical particle\nand a scalar field describing by the wave or Klein-Gordon equations with\nvariable coefficients. The initial data of the system are supposed to be a\nrandom function which has some mixing properties. We study the distribution\n\\mu_t of the random solution at time moments t\\in\\R. The main result is the\nconvergence of \\mu_t to a Gaussian probability measure as t\\to\\infty. The\nmixing properties of the limit measures are studied. The application to the\ncase of Gibbs initial measures is given.\n", "  According to General Relativity, as distinct from Newtonian gravity, motion\nunder gravity is treated by a theory that deals, initially, only with test\nparticles. At the same time, satellite measurements deal with extended bodies.\nWe discuss the correspondence between geodesic motion in General Relativity and\nthe motion of an extended body by means of the Ehlers-Geroch theorem, and in\nthe context of the recently launched LAser RElativity Satellite (LARES). Being\npossibly the highest mean density orbiting body in the Solar system, this\nsatellite provides the best realization of a test particle ever reached\nexperimentally and provides a unique possibility for testing the predictions of\nGeneral Relativity.\n", "  Despite the long history of modelling human mobility, we continue to lack a\nhighly accurate approach with low data requirements for predicting mobility\npatterns in cities. Here, we present a population-weighted opportunities model\nwithout any adjustable parameters to capture the underlying driving force\naccounting for human mobility patterns at the city scale. We use various\nmobility data collected from a number of cities with different characteristics\nto demonstrate the predictive power of our model. We find that insofar as the\nspatial distribution of population is available, our model offers universal\nprediction of mobility patterns in good agreement with real observations,\nincluding distance distribution, destination travel constraints and flux. In\ncontrast, the models that succeed in modelling mobility patterns in countries\nare not applicable in cities, which suggests that there is a diversity of human\nmobility at different spatial scales. Our model has potential applications in\nmany fields relevant to mobility behaviour in cities, without relying on\nprevious mobility measurements.\n", "  We consider the four-dimensional integrable Martinez Alonso--Shabat equation,\nand list three integrable three-dimensional reductions thereof. We also present\na four-dimensional integrable modified Martinez Alonso--Shabat equation\ntogether with its Lax pair.\n  We also construct an infinite hierarchy of commuting nonlocal symmetries (and\nnot just the shadows, as it is usually the case in the literature) for the\nMartinez Alonso--Shabat equation.\n", "  The word-frequency distribution of a text written by an author is well\naccounted for by a maximum entropy distribution, the RGF (random group\nformation)-prediction. The RGF-distribution is completely determined by the a\npriori values of the total number of words in the text (M), the number of\ndistinct words (N) and the number of repetitions of the most common word\n(k_max). It is here shown that this maximum entropy prediction also describes a\ntext written in Chinese characters. In particular it is shown that although the\nsame Chinese text written in words and Chinese characters have quite\ndifferently shaped distributions, they are nevertheless both well predicted by\ntheir respective three a priori characteristic values. It is pointed out that\nthis is analogous to the change in the shape of the distribution when\ntranslating a given text to another language. Another consequence of the\nRGF-prediction is that taking a part of a long text will change the input\nparameters (M, N, k_max) and consequently also the shape of the frequency\ndistribution. This is explicitly confirmed for texts written in Chinese\ncharacters. Since the RGF-prediction has no system-specific information beyond\nthe three a priori values (M, N, k_max), any specific language characteristic\nhas to be sought in systematic deviations from the RGF-prediction and the\nmeasured frequencies. One such systematic deviation is identified and, through\na statistical information theoretical argument and an extended RGF-model, it is\nproposed that this deviation is caused by multiple meanings of Chinese\ncharacters. The effect is stronger for Chinese characters than for Chinese\nwords. The relation between Zipf's law, the Simon-model for texts and the\npresent results are discussed.\n", "  The recent study of centrality and transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) dependence\nof inclusive charged hardron elliptic anisotropy ($v_{2}$) at midrapidity\n($|\\eta|<1.0$) in Au+Au collision at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, and\n39 GeV in STAR Beam Energy Scan program is presented. We show that the observed\nincrease of inclusive $v_{2}$ is mainly due to the average $p_{T}$ increase\nwith energy. In Au+Au 200 GeV collisions, the triangular anisotropy ($v_{3}$)\nmeasurements highly depend on measurment methods; $v_{3}$ is strongly dependent\non $\\Delta\\eta$. The difference between two- and four-particle cumulants\n$v_{2}\\lbrace{2}\\rbrace$ and $v_{2}\\lbrace{4}\\rbrace$ for Au+Au and Cu+Cu\ncollision at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 62.4 and 200 GeV is used to explore flow\nfluctuations. Furthermore, by exploiting the symmetry of average flow in\npseudorapidity $\\eta$ about mid-rapidty, the $\\Delta\\eta$-dependent and\nindependent components are seperated using $v_{2}\\lbrace2\\rbrace$ and\n$v_{2}\\lbrace{4}\\rbrace$.\n", "  The text-length-dependence of real word-frequency distributions can be\nconnected to the general properties of a random book. It is pointed out that\nthis finding has strong implications, when deciding between two conceptually\ndifferent views on word-frequency distributions, i.e. the specific\n`Zipf's-view' and the non-specific `Randomness-view', as is discussed. It is\nalso noticed that the text-length transformation of a random book does have an\nexact scaling property precisely for the power-law index $\\gamma=1$, as opposed\nto the Zipf's exponent $\\gamma=2$ and the implication of this exact scaling\nproperty is discussed. However a real text has $\\gamma>1$ and as a consequence\n$\\gamma$ increases when shortening a real text. The connections to the\npredictions from the RGF(Random Group Formation) and to the infinite\nlength-limit of a meta-book are also discussed. The difference between\n`curve-fitting' and `predicting' word-frequency distributions is stressed. It\nis pointed out that the question of randomness versus specifics for the\ndistribution of outcomes in case of sufficiently complex systems has a much\nwider relevance than just the word-frequency example analyzed in the present\nwork.\n", "  A data-driven method was applied to measurements of Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}} =$ 200 GeV made with the STAR detector at RHIC to isolate\npseudorapidity distance $\\Delta\\eta$-dependent and $\\Delta\\eta$-independent\ncorrelations by using two- and four-particle azimuthal cumulant measurements.\nWe identified a component of the correlation that is $\\Delta\\eta$-independent,\nwhich is likely dominated by anisotropic flow and flow fluctuations. It was\nalso found to be independent of $\\eta$ within the measured range of\npseudorapidity $|\\eta|<1$. The relative flow fluctuation was found to be $34\\%\n\\pm 2\\% (stat.) \\pm 3\\% (sys.)$ for particles of transverse momentum $p_{T}$\nless than $2$ GeV/$c$. The $\\Delta\\eta$-dependent part may be attributed to\nnonflow correlations, and is found to be $5\\% \\pm 2\\% (sys.)$ relative to the\nflow of the measured second harmonic cumulant at $|\\Delta\\eta| > 0.7$.\n", "  The present work provides a theoretical explanation for the quantisation of\nelectric charges, an open problem since Millikan's oil drop experiment in 1909.\nThis explanation is based solely on Maxwell's theory, it recasts\nElectromagnetic theory under the language of complex line bundles; therefore,\nneither magnetic poles nor quantum mechanics are invoked. The existence of\nmagnetic poles was essentially the only theoretical explanation for charge\nquantisation (e.g. Dirac's magnetic pole), and there is no experimental data\nsupporting their existence.\n", "  Dihadron correlations are measured in d+Au collisions at 200 GeV by the STAR\ndetector. The correlated yields with uniform background subtraction are studied\nin high- and low-multiplicity collisions. The effects of multiplicity selection\nbias on jet-like correlations are discussed. Finite correlated yields are\nobserved on the near-side at large pseudo-rapidity separation in\nhigh-multiplicity collisions.\n", "  Dihadron correlations are analyzed in $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}} = 200$ GeV $d$+Au\ncollisions classified by forward charged particle multiplicity and zero-degree\nneutral energy in the Au-beam direction. It is found that the jetlike\ncorrelated yield increases with the event multiplicity. After taking into\naccount this dependence, the non-jet contribution on the away side is minimal,\nleaving little room for a back-to-back ridge in these collisions.\n", "  We study experimentally a four-winged flapping flyer with chord-wise flexible\nwings in a self-propelled setup. For a given physical configuration of the\nflyer (i.e. fixed distance between the forewing and hindwing pairs and fixed\nwing flexibility), we explore the kinematic parameter space constituted by the\nflapping frequency and the forewing-hindwing phase lag. Cruising speed and\nconsumed electric power measurements are performed for each point in the\n$(f,\\varphi)$ parameter space and allow us to discuss the problem of\nperformance and efficiency in four-winged flapping flight. We show that\ndifferent phase-lags are needed for the system to be optimised for fastest\nflight or lowest energy consumption. A conjecture of the underlying mechanism\nis proposed in terms of the coupled dynamics of the forewing-hindwing phase lag\nand the deformation kinematics of the flexible wings.\n", "  We present infinitely many nonlocal conservation laws, a pair of compatible\nlocal Hamiltonian structures and a recursion operator for the equations\ndescribing surfaces in three-dimensional space that admit nontrivial\ndeformations which preserve both principal directions and principal curvatures\n(or, equivalently, the shape operator).\n", "  Dihadron angular correlations in $d$+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=200$\nGeV are reported as a function of the measured zero-degree calorimeter neutral\nenergy and the forward charged hadron multiplicity in the Au-beam direction. A\nfinite correlated yield is observed at large relative pseudorapidity\n($\\Delta\\eta$) on the near side (i.e. relative azimuth $\\Delta\\phi\\sim0$). This\ncorrelated yield as a function of $\\Delta\\eta$ appears to scale with the\ndominant, primarily jet-related, away-side ($\\Delta\\phi\\sim\\pi$) yield. The\nFourier coefficients of the $\\Delta\\phi$ correlation, $V_{n}=\\langle\\cos\nn\\Delta\\phi\\rangle$, have a strong $\\Delta\\eta$ dependence. In addition, it is\nfound that $V_{1}$ is approximately inversely proportional to the mid-rapidity\nevent multiplicity, while $V_{2}$ is independent of it with similar magnitude\nin the forward ($d$-going) and backward (Au-going) directions.\n", "  In this paper, we address a crucial point regarding the description of\nmoderate to high Reynolds numbers aquatic swimmers. For decades, swimming\nanimals have been classified in two different families of propulsive mechanisms\nbased on the Reynolds number: the \"resistive\" swimmers, using local friction to\nproduce the necessary thrust force for locomotion at low Reynolds number and\nthe \"reactive\" swimmers, lying in the high Reynolds range, and using added mass\nacceleration (described by perfect fluid theory). However, inertial swimmers\nare also systems that dissipate energy, due to their finite size, therefore\ninvolving strong resistive contributions, even for high Reynolds numbers. Using\na complete model for the hydrodynamic forces, involving both reactive and\nresistive contributions, we revisit here the physical mechanisms responsible\nfor the thrust production of such swimmers. We show, for instance, that the\nresistive part of the force balance is as crucial as added mass effects in the\nmodeling of the thrust force, especially for elongated species. The conclusions\nbrought by this work may have significant contributions to the understanding of\ncomplex swimming mechanisms, especially for the future design of artificial\nswimmers.\n", "  Compatibility of symmetric quantization of the Dirac equation in a curved\nspace with general covariance gives a special representation of the spin\nconnections in which their dot product with the Dirac gamma matrices becomes\nequal to the \"covariant divergence\" of the latter. Requiring that the square of\nthe equation gives the conventional Klein-Gordon equation in a curved space\nresults in an operator algebra for the Dirac gamma matrices that involves the\n\"covariant derivative\" connections and the Riemann-Christoffel connections. In\n1+1 space-time with static metric, we obtain exact solutions of this Dirac\nequation model for some examples. We also formulate the interacting theory of\nthe model with various coupling modes and solve it in the same space for a\ngiven potential configuration.\n", "  Conforming materials to rigid substrates with Gaussian curvature --- positive\nfor spheres and negative for saddles --- has proven a versatile tool to guide\nthe self-assembly of defects such as scars, pleats, folds, blisters, and liquid\ncrystal ripples. Here, we show how curvature can likewise be used to control\nmaterial failure and guide the paths of cracks. In our experiments, and unlike\nin previous studies on cracked plates and shells, we constrained flat elastic\nsheets to adopt fixed curvature profiles. This constraint provides a geometric\ntool for controlling fracture behavior: curvature can stimulate or suppress the\ngrowth of cracks, and steer or arrest their propagation. A simple analytical\nmodel captures crack behavior at the onset of propagation, while a\ntwo-dimensional phase-field model with an added curvature term successfully\ncaptures the crack's path. Because the curvature-induced stresses are\nindependent of material parameters for isotropic, brittle media, our results\napply across scales.\n", "  We propose a conservative two-dimensional particle model in which particles\ncarry a continuous and classical spin. The model includes standard\nferromagnetic interactions between spins of two different particles, and a\nnonstandard coupling between spin and velocity of the same particle inspired by\nthe coupling observed in self-propelled hard discs. Because of this coupling\nGalilean invariance is broken and the conserved linear momentum associated to\ntranslation invariance is not proportional to the velocity of the center of\nmass. Also, the dynamics is not invariant under a global rotation of the spins\nalone. This, in principle, leaves room for collective motion and thus raises\nthe question whether collective motion can arise in Hamiltonian systems. We\nstudy the statistical mechanics of such a system, and show that, in the fully\nconnected (or mean-field) case, a transition to collective motion does exist in\nspite of momentum conservation. Interestingly, the velocity of the center of\nmass, which in the absence of Galilean invariance, is a relevant variable, also\nfeeds back on the magnetization properties, as it acts as an external magnetic\nfield that smoothens the transition. Molecular dynamics simulations of finite\nsize systems indeed reveal a rich phase diagram, with a transition from a\ndisordered to a homogeneous polar phase, but also more complex inhomogeneous\nphases with local order interrupted by topological defects.\n", "  The Heun operator has been cast, in terms of the elements of an underlying\n$su(1,1)$ algebra, under specific parametric conditions, for the purpose of\nspectrum generation. These elements are differential operators of\n\\emph{degrees} $\\pm 1/2$ and $0$. It is found that the regular singularities at\n$0$ and $\\infty$ of the general Heun equation must be \\emph{elementary} under\nthe required parametric conditions. The spectrum generation has been\ndemonstrated through a set of examples.\n", "  We point out that the functional form describing the frequency of sizes of\nevents in complex systems (e.g. earthquakes, forest fires, bursts of neuronal\nactivity) can be obtained from maximal likelihood inference, which, remarkably,\nonly involve a few available observed measures such as number of events, total\nevent size and extremes. Most importantly, the method is able to predict with\nhigh accuracy the frequency of the rare extreme events. To be able to predict\nthe few, often big impact events, from the frequent small events is of course\nof great general importance. For a data set of wind speed we are able to\npredict the frequency of gales with good precision. We analyse several examples\nranging from the shortest length of a recruit to the number of Chinese\ncharacters which occur only once in a text.\n", "  The quantum problem of an electron moving in a plane under the field created\nby two Coulombian centers admits simple analytical solutions for some\nparticular inter-center distances. These elementary eigenfunctions, akin to\nthose found by Demkov for the analogous three dimensional problem, are\ncalculated using the framework of quasi-exact solvability of a pair of\nentangled ODE's descendants from the Heun equation. A different but interesting\nsituation arises when the two centers have the same strength. In this case\ncompletely elementary solutions do not exist.\n", "  We develop a universal distributional calculus for regulated volumes of\nmetrics that are singular along hypersurfaces. When the hypersurface is a\nconformal infinity we give simple integrated distribution expressions for the\ndivergences and anomaly of the regulated volume functional valid for any choice\nof regulator. For closed hypersurfaces or conformally compact geometries,\nmethods from a previously developed boundary calculus for conformally compact\nmanifolds can be applied to give explicit holographic formulae for the\ndivergences and anomaly expressed as hypersurface integrals over local\nquantities (the method also extends to non-closed hypersurfaces). The resulting\nanomaly does not depend on any particular choice of regulator, while the\nregulator dependence of the divergences is precisely captured by these\nformulae. Conformal hypersurface invariants can be studied by demanding that\nthe singular metric obey, smoothly and formally to a suitable order, a Yamabe\ntype problem with boundary data along the conformal infinity. We prove that the\nvolume anomaly for these singular Yamabe solutions is a conformally invariant\nintegral of a local Q-curvature that generalizes the Branson Q-curvature by\nincluding data of the embedding. In each dimension this canonically defines a\nhigher dimensional generalization of the Willmore energy/rigid string action.\nRecently Graham proved that the first variation of the volume anomaly recovers\nthe density obstructing smooth solutions to this singular Yamabe problem; we\ngive a new proof of this result employing our boundary calculus. Physical\napplications of our results include studies of quantum corrections to\nentanglement entropies.\n", "  We propose a novel measure of degree heterogeneity, for unweighted and\nundirected complex networks, which requires only the degree distribution of the\nnetwork for its computation. We show that the proposed measure can be applied\nto all types of network topology with ease and increases with the diversity of\nnode degrees in the network. The measure is applied to compute the\nheterogeneity of synthetic (both random and scale free) and real world networks\nwith its value normalized in the interval [0, 1]. To define the measure, we\nintroduce a limiting network whose heterogeneity can be expressed analytically\nwith the value tending to 1 as the size of the network N tends to infinity. We\nnumerically study the variation of heterogeneity for random graphs (as a\nfunction of p and N) and for scale free networks with and N as variables.\nFinally, as a specific application, we show that the proposed measure can be\nused to compare the heterogeneity of recurrence networks constructed from the\ntime series of several low dimensional chaotic attractors9thereby providing a\nsingle index to compare the structural complexity of chaotic attractors.\n", "  We prove a version of the moving particle lemma for the exclusion process on\nany finite weighted graph, based on the octopus inequality of Caputo, Liggett,\nand Richthammer. In light of their proof of Aldous' spectral gap conjecture, we\nconjecture that our moving particle lemma is optimal in general. Our result can\nbe applied to graphs which lack translational invariance, including, but not\nlimited to, fractal graphs. An application of our result is the proof of local\nergodicity for the exclusion process on a class of weighted graphs, the details\nof which are reported in a follow-up paper [arXiv:1705.10290].\n", "  The existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Yang-Mills heat equation is\nproven over three dimensional Euclidean space and over a bounded open convex\nset therein. The initial data is taken to lie in the Sobolev space of order one\nhalf, which is the critical Sobolev index for this equation over a three\ndimensional manifold. The existence is proven by solving first an augmented,\nstrictly parabolic equation and then gauge transforming the solution to a\nsolution of the Yang-Mills heat equation itself. The gauge functions needed to\ncarry out this procedure lie in the critical gauge group of Sobolev regularity\nthree halves, which is a complete topological group in a natural metric but is\nnot a Hilbert Lie group. The nature of this group must be understood in order\nto carry out the reconstruction procedure. Solutions to the Yang-Mills heat\nequation are shown to be strong solutions modulo these gauge functions. Energy\ninequalities and Neumann domination inequalities are used to establish needed\ninitial behavior properties of solutions to the augmented equation.\n", "  Introduction for a special issue of Physica E dedicated to the memory of\nMarkus B\\\"uttiker.\n", "  CP violation of the SM is insufficient to explain the baryon asymmetry in the\nuniverse and therefore an additional source of CP violation is needed. Here the\nextension of the SM by a neutral complex scalar singlet with a nonzero vacuum\nexpectation value (cSMCS) plus a heavy vector quark pair is considered. This\nmodel offers the spontaneous CP violation and proper description in the\nbaryogenesis, it leads strong enough first-order electro-weak phase transition\nto suppress the baryon-violating sphaleron process.\n", "  GeSn epitaxial heterostructures are emerging as prominent candidates for the\nmonolithic integration of light sources on Si substrates. Here we propose a\njudicious explanation for their temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL)\nthat is based upon the so far disregarded optical activity of dislocations. By\nworking at the onset of plastic relaxation, which occurs whenever the epilayer\nreleases the strain accumulated during growth on the lattice mismatched\nsubstrate, we demonstrate that dislocation nucleation can be explicitly seen in\nthe PL data. Notably, our findings point out that a monotonous thermal PL\nquenching can be observed in coherent films, in spite of the indirect nature of\nthe GeSn bandgap. Our investigation, therefore, contributes to a deeper\nunderstanding of the recombination dynamics in this intriguing group IV alloy\nand offers insights into crucial phenomena shaping the light emission\nefficiency.\n", "  After a brief introduction to the black hole stability problem, we outline\nour recent proof of the linear stability of the non-extreme Kerr geometry.\n", "  By considering (non-relativistic) quantum mechanics as it is done in practice\nin particular in condensed-matter physics, it is argued that a deterministic,\nunitary time evolution within a chosen Hilbert space always has a limited\nscope, leaving a lot of room for embedding the quantum-classical transition\ninto our current theories without recurring to difficult-to-accept\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics. Nonunitary projections to initial and\nfinal states, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, a change of Hilbert\nspace, and the introduction of classical concepts such as external potentials\nor localized atomic nuclei are widespread in quantum mechanical calculations.\nFurthermore, quantum systems require classical environments that enable the\nsymmetry breaking that is necessary for creating the atomic configurations of\nmolecules and crystals. This paper argues that such classical environments are\nprovided by finite-temperature macroscopic systems in which the range of\nquantum correlations and entanglement is limited. This leads to classical\nbehavior on larger scales, and to collapse-like events in all dynamical\nprocesses that become coupled to the thermalized degrees of freedom.\n", "  Classical orthogonal polynomial systems of Jacobi, Hermite, Laguerre and\nBessel have the property that the polynomials of each system are eigenfunctions\nof a second order ordinary differential operator. According to a classical\ntheorem by Bochner they are the only systems with this property. Similarly, the\npolynomials of Charlier, Meixner, Kravchuk and Hahn are both orthogonal and are\neigenfunctions of a suitable difference operator of second order. We recall\nthat according to the famous theorem of Favard-Shohat, the condition of\northogonality is equivalent to the 3-term recurrence relation. Vector\northogonal polynomials (VOP) satisfy finite-term recurrence relation with more\nterms, according to a theorem by J. Van Iseghem and this characterizes them.\n  Motivated by Bochner's theorem we are looking for VOP that are also\neigenfunctions of a differential (difference) operator. We call these\nsimultaneous conditions Bochner's property.\n  The goal of this paper is to introduce methods for construction of VOP which\nhave Bochner's property. The methods are purely algebraic and are based on\nautomorphisms of non-commutative algebras. They also use ideas from the so\ncalled bispectral problem. Applications of the abstract methods include broad\ngeneralizations of the classical orthogonal polynomials, both continuous and\ndiscrete. Other results connect different families of VOP, including the\nclassical ones, by linear transforms of purely algebraic origin, despite of the\nfact that, when interpreted analytically, they are integral transformations.\n", "  The notion of fractional monodromy was introduced by Nekhoroshev,\nSadovski\\'{i} and Zhilinski\\'{i} as a generalization of standard (`integer')\nmonodromy in the sense of Duistermaat from torus bundles to singular torus\nfibrations. In the present paper we prove a general result that allows to\ncompute fractional monodromy in various integrable Hamiltonian systems. In\nparticular, we show that the non-triviality of fractional monodromy in 2\ndegrees of freedom systems with a Hamiltonian circle action is related only to\nthe fixed points of the circle action. Our approach is based on the study of a\nspecific notion of parallel transport along Seifert manifolds.\n", "  A novel way to produce quantum Hall ribbons in a cold atomic system is to use\nM hyperfine states of atoms in a 1D optical lattice to mimic an additional\n\"synthetic dimension\". A notable aspect here is that the SU(M) symmetric\ninteraction between atoms manifests as \"infinite ranged\" along the synthetic\ndimension. We study the many body physics of fermions with attractive\ninteractions in this system. We use a combination of analytical field theoretic\nand numerical density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to reveal the\nrich ground state phase diagram of the system, including novel phases such as\nsquished baryon fluids. Remarkably, changing the parameters entails unusual\ncrossovers and transitions, e. g., we show that increasing the magnetic field\n(that produces the Hall effect) may convert a \"ferrometallic\" state at low\nfields to a \"squished baryon superfluid\" (with algebraic pairing correlations)\nat high fields. We also show that this system provides a unique opportunity to\nstudy quantum phase separation in a multiflavor ultracold fermionic system.\n", "  The discussion-board site 4chan has been part of the Internet's dark\nunderbelly since its inception, and recent political events have put it\nincreasingly in the spotlight. In particular, /pol/, the \"Politically\nIncorrect\" board, has been a central figure in the outlandish 2016 US election\nseason, as it has often been linked to the alt-right movement and its rhetoric\nof hate and racism. However, 4chan remains relatively unstudied by the\nscientific community: little is known about its user base, the content it\ngenerates, and how it affects other parts of the Web. In this paper, we start\naddressing this gap by analyzing /pol/ along several axes, using a dataset of\nover 8M posts we collected over two and a half months. First, we perform a\ngeneral characterization, showing that /pol/ users are well distributed around\nthe world and that 4chan's unique features encourage fresh discussions. We also\nanalyze content, finding, for instance, that YouTube links and hate speech are\npredominant on /pol/. Overall, our analysis not only provides the first\nmeasurement study of /pol/, but also insight into online harassment and hate\nspeech trends in social media.\n", "  In this work, we derive an expression for the correction in the Newton's law\nof gravitation due to the gravitational Kaluza-Klein states in a general thick\nstring-like braneworld scenario in six dimensions. In order to analyze\ncorrections to Newton's law we study the gravity fluctuations in a 3-brane\nplaced in a transverse resolved conifold and use suitable numerical methods to\nattain the massive spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions. Such\nbraneworld model has a resolution parameter which removes the conical\nsingularity. The correction has an exponentially suppressed mass term and\ndepends on the values of the eigenfunctions and warp factors computed at the\ncore peak of the brane. The spectrum is real and monotonically increased, as\ndesired. However, the resolution parameter must assume moderate values to have\nphysically acceptable states. Moreover, the trapped massless mode regains the\n4D gravity and it is displaced from the origin, sharing similar profile with\nthe energy density of brane for small values of resolution parameter. Finally,\nfor the singular conifold, we found that a non-first eigenstate is a resonant\nmode. Such excited state is the largest contributor to corrections in the\nNewtonian potential.\n", "  Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a promising material for high-performance\nelectronics beyond silicon. But unlike silicon, the nature of the transport\nband gap in CNTs is not fully understood. The transport gap in CNTs is\npredicted to be strongly driven by electron-electron (e-e) interactions and\ncorrelations, even at room temperature. Here, we use dielectric liquids to\nscreen e-e interactions in individual suspended ultra-clean CNTs. Using\nmultiple techniques, the transport gap is measured as dielectric screening is\nincreased. Changing the dielectric environment from air to isopropanol, we\nobserve a 25% reduction in the transport gap of semiconducting CNTs, and a 32%\nreduction in the band gap of narrow-gap CNTs. Additional measurements are\nreported in dielectric oils. Our results elucidate the nature of the transport\ngap in CNTs, and show that dielectric environment offers a mechanism for\nsignificant control over the transport band gap.\n", "  The mixed initial-boundary value problem for infinite one-dimensional chain\nof harmonic oscillators on the half-line is considered. We study the large time\nbehavior of solutions and derive the dispersive bounds.\n", "  The evidence for abundant liquid water on early Mars despite the faint young\nSun is a long-standing problem in planetary research. Here we present new ab\ninitio spectroscopic and line-by-line climate calculations of the warming\npotential of reduced atmospheres on early Mars. We show that the strength of\nboth CO2-H2 and CO2-CH4 collision-induced absorption (CIA) has previously been\nsignificantly underestimated. Contrary to previous expectations, methane could\nhave acted as a powerful greenhouse gas on early Mars due to CO2-CH4 CIA in the\ncritical 250-500 cm^-1 spectral window region. In atmospheres of 0.5 bar CO2 or\nmore, percent levels of H2 or CH4 raise annual mean surface temperatures by\ntens of degrees, with temperatures reaching 273 K for pressures of 1.25-2~bar\nand 2-10% of H2 and CH4. Methane and hydrogen produced following aqueous\nalteration of Mars' crust could have combined with volcanically outgassed CO2\nto form transient atmospheres of this composition 4.5-3.5 Ga. Our results also\nsuggest that inhabited exoplanets could retain surface liquid water at\nsignificant distances from their host stars.\n", "  We present a suite of 15 cosmological zoom-in simulations of isolated dark\nmatter halos, all with masses of $M_{\\rm halo} \\approx 10^{10}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$\nat $z=0$, in order to understand the relationship between halo assembly, galaxy\nformation, and feedback's effects on the central density structure in dwarf\ngalaxies. These simulations are part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments\n(FIRE) project and are performed at extremely high resolution. The resultant\ngalaxies have stellar masses that are consistent with rough abundance matching\nestimates, coinciding with the faintest galaxies that can be seen beyond the\nvirial radius of the Milky Way ($M_\\star/{\\rm M}_\\odot\\approx 10^5-10^7$). This\nnon-negligible spread in stellar mass at $z=0$ in halos within a narrow range\nof virial masses is strongly correlated with central halo density or maximum\ncircular velocity $V_{\\rm max}$. Much of this dependence of $M_\\star$ on a\nsecond parameter (beyond $M_{\\rm halo}$) is a direct consequence of the $M_{\\rm\nhalo}\\sim10^{10}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ mass scale coinciding with the threshold for\nstrong reionization suppression: the densest, earliest-forming halos remain\nabove the UV-suppression scale throughout their histories while late-forming\nsystems fall below the UV-suppression scale over longer periods and form fewer\nstars as a result. In fact, the latest-forming, lowest-concentration halo in\nour suite fails to form any stars. Halos that form galaxies with\n$M_\\star\\gtrsim2\\times10^{6}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ have reduced central densities\nrelative to dark-matter-only simulations, and the radial extent of the density\nmodifications is well-approximated by the galaxy half-mass radius $r_{1/2}$.\nThis apparent stellar mass threshold of $M_\\star \\approx 2\\times 10^{6} \\approx\n2\\times 10^{-4} \\,M_{\\rm halo}$ is broadly consistent with previous work and\nprovides a testable prediction of FIRE feedback models in LCDM.\n", "  We present calculations of coherent photoproduction of vector mesons\n($J/\\Psi$ and $\\Upsilon$) with leading-order parton distribution functions to\ncheck new kinds of corrections of the DGLAP equations and nuclear\nmodifications. The input gluon distribution of the proton is the dynamical\nparton model from the DGLAP equations with GLR-MQ-ZRS (Gribov-Levin-Ryskin,\nMueller-Qiu, Zhu-Ruan-Shen) modifications. From comparison between several\nother gluon distribution models, we find that the dynamical gluon distribution\nfits with the results of meson photoproduction experiments in the high energy\nregion. The calculation of the differential cross sections using dynamical and\nother gluon distributions is compared with the experimental data from the HERA,\nZEUS and LHCb Collaborations. Although there is little data for the rapidity\ndistribution of vector meson photoproduction near zero rapidity, the dynamical\ngluon distribution works well with the data in the large rapidity region.\n", "  Two-component conductors -- e.g., semi-metals and narrow band semiconductors\n-- often exhibit unusually strong magnetoresistance in a wide temperature\nrange. Suppression of the Hall voltage near charge neutrality in such systems\ngives rise to a strong quasiparticle drift in the direction perpendicular to\nthe electric current and magnetic field. This drift is responsible for a strong\ngeometrical increase of resistance even in weak magnetic fields. Combining the\nBoltzmann kinetic equation with sample electrostatics, we develop a microscopic\ntheory of magnetotransport in two and three spatial dimensions. The compensated\nHall effect in confined geometry is always accompanied by electron-hole\nrecombination near the sample edges and at large-scale inhomogeneities. As the\nresult, classical edge currents may dominate the resistance in the vicinity of\ncharge compensation. The effect leads to linear magnetoresistance in two\ndimensions in a broad range of parameters. In three dimensions, the\nmagnetoresistance is normally quadratic in the field, with the linear regime\nrestricted to rectangular samples with magnetic field directed perpendicular to\nthe sample surface. Finally, we discuss the effects of heat flow and\ntemperature inhomogeneities on the magnetoresistance.\n", "  Recently we predicted that the Andreev bound state spectrum of 4-terminal\nJosephson junctions may possess topologically protected zero-energy Weyl\nsingularities, which manifest themselves in a quantized transconductance in\nunits of $4e^2/h$ when two of the terminals are voltage biased [R.-P. Riwar et\nal., Nature Commun. 7, 11167 (2016)]. Here, using the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker\nscattering theory, we compute numerically the currents flowing through such a\nstructure in order to assess the conditions for observing this effect. We show\nthat the voltage below which the transconductance becomes quantized is\ndetermined by the interplay of non-adiabatic transitions between Andreev bound\nstates and inelastic relaxation processes. We demonstrate that the topological\nquantization of the transconductance can be observed at voltages of the order\nof $10^{-2} \\Delta/e$, $\\Delta$ being the superconducting gap in the leads.\n", "  We present a simple method to compensate for losses in a polariton\nsuperfluid. Based on a weak support field, it allows for an extended\npropagation of a resonantly driven polariton superfluid at a minimal energetic\ncost. Moreover, this setup based on optical bistability, leads to a significant\nrelease of the phase constraint imposed by the resonant driving. This release,\ntogether with the macroscopic polariton propagation, offers a unique\nopportunity to study the hydrodynamics of topological excitations of polariton\nsuperfluids such as quantized vortices and dark solitons. We numerically study\nhow the coherent field supporting the superfluid flow interacts with the\nvortices and how it can be used to control them. Interestingly, we show that\nstandard hydrodynamics does not apply for this driven-dissipative fluid and new\nbehaviours are identified.\n", "  Perturbative series of some quantities in quantum field theories, such as the\npole mass of a quark, suffer from a kind of divergence called renormalon\ndivergence. In this paper, the leading renormalon in the pole mass is\ninvestigated, and a map is introduced to suppress this renormalon. The inverse\nof the map is then used to generate the leading renormalon and obtain an\nexpression to calculate its overall normalization. Finally, the overall\nnormalization of the leading renormalon of the pole mass is calculated for\nseveral values of quark flavors.\n", "  Our understanding of topological insulators is based on an underlying\ncrystalline lattice where the local electronic degrees of freedom at different\nsites hybridize with each other in ways that produce nontrivial band topology,\nand the search for material systems to realize such phases have been strongly\ninfluenced by this. Here we theoretically demonstrate topological insulators in\nsystems with a random distribution of sites in space, i. e., a random lattice.\nThis is achieved by constructing hopping models on random lattices whose ground\nstates possess nontrivial topological nature (characterized e. g., by Bott\nindices) that manifests as quantized conductances in systems with a boundary.\nBy tuning parameters such as the density of sites (for a given range of fermion\nhopping), we can achieve transitions from trivial to topological phases. We\ndiscuss interesting features of these transitions. In two spatial dimensions,\nwe show this for all five symmetry classes (A, AII, D, DIII and C) that are\nknown to host nontrivial topology in crystalline systems. We expect similar\nphysics to be realizable in any dimension and provide an explicit example of a\n$Z_2$ topological insulator on a random lattice in three spatial dimensions.\nOur study not only provides a deeper understanding of the topological phases of\nnon-interacting fermions, but also suggests new directions in the pursuit of\nthe laboratory realization of topological quantum matter.\n", "  Improved understanding of molecular systems has only emphasised the\nsophistication of networks within the cell. Simultaneously, the advance of\nnucleic acid nanotechnology, a platform within which reactions can be\nexquisitely controlled, has made the development of artificial architectures\nand devices possible. Vital to this progress has been a solid foundation in the\nthermodynamics of molecular systems. In this pedagogical review and\nperspective, I will discuss how thermodynamics determines both the overall\npotential of molecular networks, and the minute details of design. I will then\nargue that, in turn, the need to understand molecular systems is helping to\ndrive the development of theories of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale.\n", "  In the paper we derive rational solutions for the lattice potential modified\nKorteweg-de Vries equation, and Q2, Q1($\\delta$), H3($\\delta$), H2 and H1 in\nthe Adler-Bobenko-Suris list. B\\\"acklund transformations between these lattice\nequations are used. All these rational solutions are related to a unified\n$\\tau$ function in Casoratian form which obeys a bilinear superposition\nformula.\n", "  Randomized benchmarking (RB) is widely used to measure an error rate of a set\nof quantum gates, by performing random circuits that would do nothing if the\ngates were perfect. In the limit of no finite-sampling error, the exponential\ndecay rate of the observable survival probabilities, versus circuit length,\nyields a single error metric $r$. For Clifford gates with arbitrary small\nerrors described by process matrices, $r$ was believed to reliably correspond\nto the mean, over all Cliffords, of the average gate infidelity (AGI) between\nthe imperfect gates and their ideal counterparts. We show that this quantity is\nnot a well-defined property of a physical gateset. It depends on the\nrepresentations used for the imperfect and ideal gates, and the variant\ntypically computed in the literature can differ from $r$ by orders of\nmagnitude. We present new theories of the RB decay that are accurate for all\nsmall errors describable by process matrices, and show that the RB decay curve\nis a simple exponential for all such errors. These theories allow explicit\ncomputation of the error rate that RB measures ($r$), but as far as we can tell\nit does not correspond to the infidelity of a physically allowed (completely\npositive) representation of the imperfect gates.\n", "  A measurement is presented of the cross section for the electroweak\nproduction of a Z boson and a photon in association with two jets in\nproton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)= 8 TeV. The Z bosons are identified through\ntheir decays to electron or muon pairs. The measurement is based on data\ncollected with the CMS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n19.7 inverse femtobarns. The electroweak contribution has a significance of 3.0\nstandard deviations, and the measured fiducial cross section is 1.86\n+0.90/-0.75 (stat) +0.34/-0.26 (syst) +/- 0.05 (lumi) fb, while the summed\nelectroweak and quantum chromodynamic total cross section in the same region is\nobserved to be 5.94 +1.53/-1.35 (stat) +0.43/-0.37 (syst) +/- 0.13 (lumi) fb.\nBoth measurements are consistent with the leading-order standard model\npredictions. Limits on anomalous quartic gauge couplings are set based on the Z\ngamma mass distribution.\n", "  Coulomb drag and depinning are electronic transport phenomena that occur in\nlow-dimensional nanostructures. Recently, both phenomena have been reported in\nbilinear Josephson junction arrays. These devices provide a unique opportunity\nto study the interplay of Coulomb drag and depinning in a system where all\nrelevant parameters can be controlled experimentally. We explain the Coulomb\ndrag and depinning characteristics in the I-V curve of the bilinear Josephson\njunction array by adopting a quasicharge model which has previously proven\nuseful in describing threshold phenomena in linear Josephson junction arrays.\nSimulations are performed for a range of coupling strengths, where numerically\nobtained I-V curves match well with what has been previously observed\nexperimentally. Analytic expressions for the ratio between the active and\npassive currents are derived from depinning arguments. Novel phenomena are\npredicted at voltages higher than those for which experimental results have\nbeen reported to date.\n", "  The dependence of the surface plasmons resonance (SPR) frequency on the size\nof gold nanoparticles (GNPs) is experimentally studied. The measured data for\nthe SPR frequency by UV-Vis spectroscopy and GNPs diameter by Dynamic Light\nScattering (DLS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Atomic Force\nMicroscopy (AFM) are collected in the course of classical citrate GNPs\nsynthesis. The relationship between the GNPs size and the blue shift of the\nlight absorption is presented. They are fitted by an equation with a single\nfree parameter, the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding media. Thus, the\nrefractive index of the surrounding media is determined, which characterizes\nthe GNPs surface shell.\n", "  The production of opposite-charge $W$-boson pairs in proton-proton collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV is measured using data corresponding to 3.16 fb$^{-1}$\nof integrated luminosity collected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large\nHadron Collider in 2015. Candidate $W$-boson pairs are selected by identifying\ntheir leptonic decays into an electron, a muon and neutrinos. Events with\nreconstructed jets are not included in the candidate event sample. The\ncross-section measurement is performed in a fiducial phase space close to the\nexperimental acceptance and is compared to theoretical predictions. Agreement\nis found between the measurement and the most accurate calculations available.\n", "  We investigate the impact of general conditions of theoretical stability and\ncosmological viability on dynamical dark energy models. As a powerful example,\nwe study whether minimally coupled, single field Quintessence models that are\nsafe from ghost instabilities, can source the CPL expansion history recently\nshown to be mildly favored by a combination of CMB (Planck) and Weak Lensing\n(KiDS) data. We find that in their most conservative form, the theoretical\nconditions impact the analysis in such a way that smooth single field\nQuintessence becomes significantly disfavored with respect to the standard LCDM\ncosmological model. This is due to the fact that these conditions cut a\nsignificant portion of the (w0;wa) parameter space for CPL, in particular\neliminating the region that would be favored by weak lensing data. Within the\nscenario of a smooth dynamical dark energy parametrized with CPL, weak lensing\ndata favors a region that would require multiple fields to ensure gravitational\nstability.\n", "  We study large families of theories of interacting spin 2 particles from the\npoint of view of causality. Although it is often stated that there is a unique\nLorentz invariant effective theory of massless spin 2, namely general\nrelativity, other theories that utilize higher derivative interactions do in\nfact exist. These theories are distinct from general relativity, as they permit\nany number of species of spin 2 particles, are described by a much larger set\nof parameters, and are not constrained to satisfy the equivalence principle. We\nconsider the leading spin 2 couplings to scalars, fermions, and vectors, and\nsystematically study signal propagation in all these other families of\ntheories. We find that most interactions directly lead to superluminal\npropagation of either a spin 2 particle or a matter particle, and interactions\nthat are subluminal generate other interactions that are superluminal. Hence,\nsuch theories of interacting multiple spin 2 species have superluminality, and\nby extension, acausality. This is radically different to the special case of\ngeneral relativity with a single species of minimally coupled spin 2, which\nleads to subluminal propagation from sources satisfying the null energy\ncondition. This pathology persists even if the spin 2 field is massive. We\ncompare these findings to the analogous case of spin 1 theories, where higher\nderivative interactions can be causal. This makes the spin 2 case very special,\nand suggests that multiple species of spin 2 is forbidden, leading us to\ngeneral relativity as essentially the unique internally consistent effective\ntheory of spin 2.\n", "  Transitions between multiple stable states of nonlinear systems are\nubiquitous in physics, chemistry, and beyond. Two types of behaviors are\nusually seen as mutually exclusive: unpredictable noise-induced transitions and\npredictable bifurcations of the underlying vector field. Here, we report a new\nsituation, corresponding to a fluctuating system approaching a bifurcation,\nwhere both effects collaborate. We show that the problem can be reduced to a\nsingle control parameter governing the competition between deterministic and\nstochastic effects. Two asymptotic regimes are identified: when the control\nparameter is small (e.g. small noise), deviations from the deterministic case\nare well described by the Freidlin-Wentzell theory. In particular, escapes over\nthe potential barrier are very rare events. When the parameter is large (e.g.\nlarge noise), such events become typical. Unlike pure noise-induced\ntransitions, the distribution of the escape time is peaked around a value which\nis asymptotically predicted by an adiabatic approximation. We show that the two\nregimes are characterized by qualitatively different reacting trajectories,\nwith algebraic and exponential divergence, respectively.\n", "  Following previous work [1], we propose to analyze the rapidity dependence of\ntransverse momentum and transverse-momentum multiplicity correlations. We\ndemonstrate that the orthogonal polynomial expansion of the latter has the\npotential to discriminate between models of particle production.\n", "  We study the spin dynamics of the Resonant Excitonic State (RES) proposed,\nwithin the theory of an emergent SU(2) symmetry, to explain some properties of\nthe pseudo-gap phase of cuprate superconductors. The RES can be described as a\nproliferation of particle-hole patches with an internal modulated structure. We\nmodel the RES modes as a charge order with multiple $2{\\bf {p}}_{\\text{F}}$\nordering vectors, where $2{\\bf {p}}_{\\text{F}}$ connects two opposite side of\nthe Fermi surface. This simple modelization enables us to propose a\ncomprehensive study of the collective mode observed at the antiferromagnetic\n(AF) wave vector $\\mathbf{Q}=(\\pi,\\pi)$ by Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS)\nin both superconducting state (SC), but also in the Pseudogap regime. In this\nregime, we show that the dynamic spin susceptibility accuses a loss of\ncoherence terms except at special wave vectors commensurate with the lattice.\nWe argue that this phenomenon could explain the change of the spin response\nshape around $\\mathbf{Q}$. We demonstrate that the hole dependence of the RES\nspin dynamics is in agreement with the experimental data in\nHgBa$_{2}$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$.\n", "  In this work, we perform a series of phonon counting measurement with\ndifferent methods in a 3-mode optomechanical system, and we compare the\ndifference of the entanglement after measurement. In this article we focus on\nthe two cases: imperfect measurement and on-off measurement. We find that\nwhatever measurement you take, the entanglement will increase. The size of\nentanglement enhancement is the largest in perfect measurement, second in the\nimperfect measurement, and it is not obvious in the on-off measurement. We are\nsure that the more precise measurement information, the larger entanglement\nconcentration.\n", "  We study a model of seed dispersal that considers the inclusion of an animal\ndisperser moving diffusively, feeding on fruits and transporting the seeds,\nwhich are later deposited and capable of germination. The dynamics depends on\nseveral population parameters of growth, decay, harvesting, transport,\ndigestion and germination. In particular, the deposition of transported seeds\nat places away from their collection sites produces a delay in the dynamics,\nwhose effects are the focus of this work. Analytical and numerical solutions of\ndifferent simplified scenarios show the existence of travelling waves. The\neffect of zoochory is apparent in the increase of the velocity of these waves.\nThe results support the hypothesis of the relevance of animal mediated seed\ndispersion when trying to understand the origin of the high rates of vegetable\ninvasion observed in real systems.\n", "  We study the angular dependence of the dissipation in the superconducting\nstate of FeSe and Fe(Se$_\\text{1-x}$Te$_\\text{x}$) through electrical transport\nmeasurements, using crystalline intergrown materials. We reveal the key role of\nthe inclusions of the non superconducting magnetic phase\nFe$_\\text{1-y}$(Se$_\\text{1-x}$Te$_\\text{x}$), growing into the\nFe(Se$_\\text{1-x}$Te$_\\text{x}$) pure $\\beta$-phase, in the development of a\ncorrelated defect structure. The matching of both atomic structures defines the\ngrowth habit of the crystalline material as well as the correlated planar\ndefects orientation.\n", "  We show how a gradient in the motility properties of non-interacting\npoint-like active particles can cause a pressure gradient that pushes a large\ninert object. We calculate the force on an object inside a system of active\nparticles with position dependent motion parameters, in one and two dimensions,\nand show that a modified Archimedes' principle is satisfied. We characterize\nthe system, both in terms of the model parameters and in terms of\nexperimentally measurable quantities: the spatial profiles of the density,\nvelocity and pressure. This theoretical analysis is motivated by recent\nexperiments, which showed that the nucleus of a mouse oocyte (immature egg\ncell) moves from the cortex to the center due to a gradient of activity of\nvesicles propelled by molecular motors; it more generally applies to artificial\nsystems of controlled localized activity.\n", "  Exclusive differential spectra in color-singlet processes at hadron colliders\nare benchmark observables that have been studied to high precision in theory\nand experiment. We present an effective-theory framework utilizing\nsoft-collinear effective theory to incorporate massive (bottom) quark effects\ninto resummed differential distributions, accounting for both heavy-quark\ninitiated primary contributions to the hard scattering process as well as\nsecondary effects from gluons splitting into heavy-quark pairs. To be specific,\nwe focus on the Drell-Yan process and consider the vector-boson transverse\nmomentum, $q_T$, and beam thrust, $\\mathcal T$, as examples of exclusive\nobservables. The theoretical description depends on the hierarchy between the\nhard, mass, and the $q_T$ (or $\\mathcal T$) scales, ranging from the decoupling\nlimit $q_T \\ll m$ to the massless limit $m \\ll q_T$. The phenomenologically\nrelevant intermediate regime $m \\sim q_T$ requires in particular quark-mass\ndependent beam and soft functions. We calculate all ingredients for the\ndescription of primary and secondary mass effects required at NNLL$'$\nresummation order (combining NNLL evolution with NNLO boundary conditions) for\n$q_T$ and $\\mathcal T$ in all relevant hierarchies. For the $q_T$ distribution\nthe rapidity divergences are different from the massless case and we discuss\nfeatures of the resulting rapidity evolution. Our results will allow for a\ndetailed investigation of quark-mass effects in the ratio of $W$ and $Z$ boson\nspectra at small $q_T$, which is important for the precision measurement of the\n$W$-boson mass at the LHC.\n", "  A trajectory isomorphism between the two Newtonian fixed center problem in\nthe sphere and two associated planar two fixed center problems is constructed\nby performing two simultaneous gnomonic projections in $S^2$. This isomorphism\nconverts the original quadratures into elliptic integrals and allows the\nbifurcation diagram of the spherical problem to be analyzed in terms of the\ncorresponding ones of the planar systems. The dynamics along the orbits in the\ndifferent regimes for the problem in $S^2$ is expressed in terms of Jacobi\nelliptic functions.\n", "  The masses of the low-lying baryons are evaluated using an ensemble with two\ndegenerate light twisted mass clover-improved quarks with mass tuned to\nreproduce the physical pion mass. The Iwasaki improved gluonic action is\nemployed. The coupling constant value corresponds to a lattice spacing of\n$a=0.0938(3)(2)$ fm, determined from the nucleon mass. We find that the clover\nterm supresses isospin symmetry breaking as compared to our previous results\nusing $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermions. The masses of the hyperons and charmed\nbaryons evaluated using this ensemble are in agreement with the experimental\nvalues. We provide predictions for the mass of the doubly charmed $\\Xi_{cc}^*$,\nas well as of the doubly and triply charmed $\\Omega$s that have not yet been\ndetermined experimentally.\n", "  Higher-derivative analogues of multidimensional conformal particle and\nmany-body conformal mechanics are constructed. Their Newton-Hooke counterparts\nare derived by applying appropriate coordinate transformations.\n", "  We develop an effective surface theory for the surface states of a Weyl\nsemimetal. This theory includes the peculiar Fermi arc states on the surface as\nwell as leakage of the states from the surface to the bulk. Subjecting the\nmodel to a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface results in quantum\noscillations. The oscillations are different from the usual ones since they do\nnot involve a closed Fermi surface cross section. It has been shown previously\nthat the Quantum oscillations can be understood semiclassically as resulting\nfrom motion of electrons on the surface Fermi arcs as well as tunneling through\nchiral Landau levels associated with the bulk. In this work we develop an\neffective surface theory and use it to analyze the quantum oscillation in the\nsemiclassical regime and beyond. Specifically, we show that when a pair of Weyl\npoints are close to each other the surface quantum oscillations acquire a phase\noffset which originates from the bulk. While the surface states are responsible\nfor a large part of the electron motion, tunneling through the bulk is\nnecessary for completing the orbit. This tunneling makes use of the bulk, zero\nenergy, chiral Landau level in each Weyl node. When the nodes are close in\nmomentum space their chiral levels overlap and a gap at zero energy is formed.\nThis gap causes the phase offset in the surface quantum oscillations.\n", "  We found that carbon-associated byproducts formed at the dry-oxidized\nSiO2/SiC(0001) interface could be decomposed and be taken out to the SiO2 side\nby high-purity Ar annealing. We evaluated the concentration of the ejected\ncarbon atoms in the SiO2 by secondary ion mass spectrometry, and discovered\nthat it clearly depends on the condition of oxide formation (dry-oxidation,\nnitridation treatment, and phosphorus treatment). This work provides an\nindirect but unambiguous evidence for the carbon-byproducts existing at the\nSiO2/SiC interfaces, and also indicates that the phosphorus treatment removes\nthe carbon-byproducts, leading to significant reduction of interface defects.\n", "  The remarkably strong chemical adsorption behaviors of nitric oxide on\nmagnesia (001) film deposited on metal substrate have been investigated by\nemploying periodic density functional calculations with Van der Waals\ncorrections. The molybdenum supported magnesia (001) show significantly\nenhanced adsorption properties and the nitric oxide is chemisorbed strongly and\npreferably trapped in flat adsorption configuration on metal supported oxide\nfilm, due to the substantially large adsorption energies and transformation\nbarriers. The analysis of Bader charges, projected density of states,\ndifferential charge densities, electron localization function, highest occupied\norbital and particular orbital with largest Mg-NO-Mg bonding coefficients, are\napplied to reveal the electronic adsorption properties and characteristics of\nbonding between nitric oxide and surface as well as the bonding within the\nhybrid structure. The strong chemical binding of nitric oxide on magnesia\ndeposited on molybdenum slab offers new opportunities for toxic gas detection\nand treatment. We anticipate that hybrid structure promoted remarkable chemical\nadsorption of nitric oxide on magnesia in this study will provide versatile\nstrategy for enhancing chemical reactivity and properties of insulating oxide.\n", "  We provide an explicit lattice model of bosons with two separately conserved\nboson species [$U(1)\\times U(1)$ global symmetry] realizing a direct transition\nbetween an integer quantum Hall effect of bosons and a trivial phase, where any\nintermediate phase is avoided by an additional symmetry interchanging the two\nspecies. If the latter symmetry is absent, we find intermediate superfluid\nphases where one or the other boson species condenses. We know the precise\nlocation of the transition since at this point our model has an exact non-local\nanti-unitary particle-hole-like symmetry that resembles particle-hole symmetry\nin the lowest Landau level of electrons. We exactly map the direct transition\nto our earlier study of the self-dual line of the easy-plane NCCP1 model, in\nthe mathematically equivalent reformulation in terms of two (new) particles\nwith $\\pi$-statistics and identical energetics. While the transition in our\nmodel is first-order, we hope that our mappings and recent renewed interest in\nsuch self-dual models will stimulate more searches for models with a continuous\ntransition.\n", "  We report the results of the implementation of a quantum key distribution\n(QKD) network using standard fibre communication lines in Moscow. The developed\nQKD network is based on the paradigm of trusted repeaters and allows a common\nsecret key to be generated between users via an intermediate trusted node. The\nmain feature of the network is the integration of the setups using two types of\nencoding, i.e. polarisation encoding and phase encoding. One of the possible\napplications of the developed QKD network is the continuous key renewal in\nexisting symmetric encryption devices with a key refresh time of up to 14 s.\n", "  Here we shall show that there is no other instability for the\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet-anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes, than the eikonal one\nand consider the features of the quasinormal spectrum in the stability sector\nin detail. The obtained quasinormal spectrum consists from the two essentially\ndifferent types of modes: perturbative and non-perturbative in the Gauss-Bonnet\ncoupling $\\alpha$. The sound and hydrodynamic modes of the perturbative branch\ncan be expressed through their Schwazrschild-AdS limits by adding a linear in\n$\\alpha$ correction to the damping rates: $\\omega \\approx Re(\\omega_{SAdS}) -\nIm(\\omega_{SAdS}) (1 - \\alpha \\cdot ((D+1) (D-4) /2 R^2)) i$, where $R$ is the\nAdS radius. The non-perturbative branch of modes consists of purely imaginary\nmodes, whose damping rates unboundedly increase when $\\alpha$ goes to zero.\nWhen the black hole radius is much larger than the anti-de Sitter radius $R$,\nthe regime of the black hole with planar horizon (black brane) is reproduced.\nIf the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\\alpha$ (or used in holography $\\lambda_{GB}$) is\nnot small enough, then the black holes and branes suffer from the instability,\nso that the holographic interpretation of perturbation of such black holes\nbecomes questionable, as, for example, the claimed viscosity bound violation in\nthe higher derivative gravity. For example, $D=5$ black brane is unstable at\n$|\\lambda_{GB}|>1/8$ and has anomalously large relaxation time when approaching\nthe threshold of instability.\n", "  We present a method to classify initial conditions of a long gamma ray bursts\nmodel sourced by a single relativistic shock. It is based on the use of\nartificial neural networks (ANNs) that are trained with light curves (LC)\ngenerated with radiation relativistic hydrodynamics simulations. The model we\nuse consists in a single shock with a highly relativistic injected beam into a\nstratified surrounding medium with profile $1/r^2$. In the process we only\nconsider the bremsstrahlung radiation and Thomson scattering process. The\ninitial conditions we use to train the ANN are three: the rest mass density,\nLorentz factor and radiation energy density of the beam that produces the\nrelativistic shock, together with the LC generated during the process. The\nclassification selects the location of a box in the 3d parameter space that\nbetter fits a given LC, and in order to decrease the uncertainty of the\nparameters this box is refined and the classification selects a new box of\nsmaller size.\n", "  We have investigated the energetic stability and the electronic properties of\nmetal-organic topological insulators bilayers (BLs), $(MC_4S_4)_3$-BL, with\nM=Ni and Pt, using first-principles calculations and tight-binding model. Our\nfindings show that $(MC_4S_4)_3$-BL is an appealing platform to perform\nelectronic band structure engineering, based on the topologically protected\nchiral edge states. The energetic stability of the BLs is ruled by van der\nWaals interactions; being the AA stacking the energetically most stable one.\nThe electronic band structure is characterized by a combination of bonding and\nanti-bonding kagome band sets (KBSs), revealing that $(NiC_4S_4)_3$-BL presents\na Z$_2$-metallic phase, whereas $(PtC_4S_4)_3$-BL may present both\nZ$_2$-metallic phase or quantum spin Hall phase. Those non-trivial topological\nstates were confirmed by the formation of chiral edge states in\n$(MC_4S_4)_3$-BL nanoribbons. We show that the localization of the edge states\ncan be controlled with a normal external electric field, breaking the mirror\nsymmetry. Hence, the sign of electric field selects in which layer each set of\nedge states are located. Such a control on the (layer) localization, of the\ntopological edge states, bring us an additional and interesting degree of\nfreedom to control the transport properties in layered metal-organic\ntopological insulator.\n", "  We report on the design and commissioning of a new spectrometer for muon-spin\nrelaxation/rotation studies installed at the Swiss Muon Source (S$\\mu$S) of the\nPaul Scherrer Institute (PSI, Switzerland). This new instrument is essentially\na new design and replaces the old general-purpose surface-muon instrument (GPS)\nwhich has been for long the workhorse of the $\\mu$SR user facility at PSI. By\nmaking use of muon and positron detectors made of plastic scintillators read\nout by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), a time resolution of the complete\ninstrument of about 160 ps (standard deviation) could be achieved. In addition,\nthe absence of light guides, which are needed in traditionally built $\\mu$SR\ninstrument to deliver the scintillation light to photomultiplier tubes located\noutside magnetic fields applied, allowed us to design a compact instrument with\na detector set covering an increased solid angle compared to the old GPS.\n", "  Bulk properties of equilibrium liquids are a manifestation of intermolecular\nforces. Here, we show how these forces imprint on dynamical fluctuations in the\nLyapunov exponents for simple fluids with and without attractive forces. While\nthe bulk of the spectrum is strongly self-averaging, the first Lyapunov\nexponent self-averages only weakly and at a rate that depends on the length\nscale of the intermolecular forces; short-range repulsive forces quantitatively\ndominate longer range attractive forces, which act as a weak perturbation that\nslows the convergence to the thermodynamic limit. Regardless of intermolecular\nforces, the fluctuations in the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate diverge, as one\nexpects for an extensive quantity, and the spontaneous fluctuations of these\ndynamical observables obey fluctuation-dissipation like relationships.\nTogether, these results are a representation of the van der Waals picture of\nfluids and another lens through which we can view the liquid state.\n", "  Precision searches for time-reversal symmetry violating interactions in polar\nmolecules are extremely sensitive probes of high energy physics beyond the\nStandard Model. To extend the reach of these probes into the PeV regime, long\ncoherence times and large count rates are necessary. Recent advances in laser\ncooling of polar molecules offer one important tool -- optical trapping.\nHowever, the types of molecules that have been laser-cooled so far do not have\nthe highly desirable combination of features for new physics searches, such as\nthe ability to fully polarize and the existence of internal co-magnetometer\nstates. We show that by utilizing the internal degrees of freedom present only\nin molecules with at least three atoms, these features can be attained\nsimultaneously with molecules that have simple structure and are amenable to\nlaser cooling and trapping.\n", "  We present a method to sum Borel- and Gevrey-summable asymptotic series by\nmatching the series to be summed with a linear combination of asymptotic series\nof known functions that themselves are scaled versions of a single,\nappropriate, but otherwise unrestricted, function $\\Phi$. Both the scaling and\nlinear coefficients are calculated from Pad\\'e approximants of a series\ntransformed from the original series by $\\Phi$. We discuss in particular the\ncase that $\\Phi$ is (essentially) a confluent hypergeometric function, which\nincludes as special cases the standard Borel-Pad\\'e and Borel-Leroy-Pad\\'e\nmethods. A particular advantage is the mechanism to build knowledge about the\nsummed function into the approximants, extending their accuracy and range even\nwhen only a few coefficients are available. Several examples from field theory\nand Rayleigh-Schr\\\"odinger perturbation theory illustrate the method.\n", "  We study steady-state continuous variable entanglement in a three-mode\noptomechanical system consisting of an active optical cavity (gain) coupled to\na passive optical cavity (loss) supporting a mechanical mode. For a driving\nlaser which is blue-detuned, we show that coupling between optical and\nmechanical modes is enhanced in the unbroken-$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry regime. We\nanalyze the stability and this shows that steady-state solutions are more\nstable in the gain and loss systems. We use these stable solutions to generate\ndistant entanglement between the mechanical mode and the optical field inside\nthe gain cavity. It results in a giant enhancement of entanglement compared to\nwhat is generated in the single lossy cavity. This work offers the prospect of\nexploring quantum state engineering and quantum information in such systems.\nFurthermore, such entanglement opens up an interesting possibility to study\nspatially separated quantum objects.\n", "  Using numerical simulations of forced turbulence, it is shown that for\nmagnetic Reynolds numbers larger than unity, i.e., beyond the regime of\nquasilinear theory, the turbulent magnetic diffusivity attains an additional\nnegative contribution that is quadratic in the kinetic helicity. In particular,\nfor large magnetic Reynolds numbers, the turbulent magnetic diffusivity without\nhelicity is about twice the value with helicity. Such a contribution was not\npreviously anticipated, but, as we discuss, it turns out to be important when\naccurate estimates of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity are needed.\n", "  Upcoming high-cadence transient survey programmes will produce a wealth of\nobservational data for Type Ia supernovae. These data sets will contain\nnumerous events detected very early in their evolution, shortly after\nexplosion. Here, we present synthetic light curves, calculated with the\nradiation hydrodynamical approach Stella for a number of different explosion\nmodels, specifically focusing on these first few days after explosion. We show\nthat overall the early light curve evolution is similar for most of the\ninvestigated models. Characteristic imprints are induced by radioactive\nmaterial located close to the surface. However, these are very similar to the\nsignatures expected from ejecta-CSM or ejecta-companion interaction. Apart from\nthe pure deflagration explosion models, none of our synthetic light curves\nexhibit the commonly assumed power-law rise. We demonstrate that this can lead\nto substantial errors in the determination of the time of explosion. In\nsummary, we illustrate with our calculations that even with very early data an\nidentification of specific explosion scenarios is challenging, if only\nphotometric observations are available.\n", "  Wave dark matter ($\\psi \\rm{DM}$) composed of extremely light bosons\n($m_{\\psi} \\sim 10^{-22}\\,\\rm eV$), with quantum pressure suppressing\nstructures below a kpc-scale de Broglie wavelength, has become a viable dark\nmatter candidate. Compared to the conventional free-particle $\\psi {\\rm DM}$\n(${\\rm FP} \\psi {\\rm DM}$), the extreme-axion $\\psi \\rm{DM}$ model (${\\rm EA}\n\\psi {\\rm DM}$) proposed by Zhang & Chiueh (2017) features a larger cut-off\nwavenumber and a broad spectral bump in the matter transfer function. Here we\nconduct cosmological simulations to compare the halo abundances and assembly\nhistories at $z=4-11$ between three different scenarios: ${\\rm FP} \\psi {\\rm\nDM}$, ${\\rm EA} \\psi {\\rm DM}$, and cold dark matter (CDM). We show that ${\\rm\nEA} \\psi {\\rm DM}$ produces significantly more abundant low-mass haloes than\n${\\rm FP} \\psi {\\rm DM}$ with the same $m_{\\psi}$, and therefore could\nalleviate the tension in $m_{\\psi}$ required by the Ly$\\alpha$ forest data and\nby the kpc-scale dwarf galaxy cores. We also find that, compared to the CDM\ncounterparts, massive ${\\rm EA} \\psi {\\rm DM}$ haloes are on average $3-4$\ntimes more massive at $z=10-11$ due to their earlier formation, undergo a\nslower mass accretion at $7 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 11$, and then show a rapidly\nrising major merger rate exceeding CDM by $\\sim 50\\%$ at $4 \\lesssim z \\lesssim\n7$. This fact suggests that ${\\rm EA} \\psi {\\rm DM}$ haloes may exhibit more\nprominent starbursts at $z \\lesssim 7$.\n", "  Weak interaction in nuclei represents a well-known venue for testing many of\nthe fundamental symmetries of the Standard Model. In particular, neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay offers the possibility to test Beyond Standard Model theories\npredicting that neutrinos are Majorana fermions and the lepton number\nconservation is violated. This paper focuses on an effective field theory\napproach to neutrinoless double-beta decay for extracting information regarding\nthe properties of the Beyond Standard Model Lagrangian responsible for this\nprocess. We use shell model nuclear matrix elements and the latest experimental\nlower limits for the half-lives to extract the lepton number violating\nparameters of five nuclei of experimental interest, and lower limits for the\nenergy scales of the new physics.\n", "  The skyrmion racetrack is a promising concept for future information\ntechnology. There, binary bits are carried by nanoscale spin swirls --\nskyrmions -- driven along magnetic strips. Stability of the skyrmions is a\ncritical issue for the realization of this technology. Here we demonstrate that\nthe racetrack skyrmion lifetime can be calculated from first principles as a\nfunction of temperature, magnetic field and track width. Our method combines\nharmonic transition state theory extended to include Goldstone modes, with an\natomistic spin Hamiltonian parametrized from density functional theory\ncalculations. We demonstrate that two annihilation mechanisms contribute to the\nskyrmion stability: At low external magnetic field, escape through the track\nboundary prevails, but a crossover field exists, above which the collapse in\nthe interior becomes dominant. Considering a Pd/Fe bilayer on an Ir(111)\nsubstrate as a well-established model system, the calculated lifetime is found\nto be consistent with reported experimental measurements. Our results open the\ndoor for predictive simulations, free from empirical parameters, to aid the\ndesign of skyrmion-based information technology.\n", "  We study the spherically symmetric collapse of a scalar field in anti-de\nSitter spacetime using a newly constructed, open-source code which parallelizes\nover heterogeneous architectures using the open standard OpenCL. An open\nquestion for this scenario concerns how to tell, a priori, whether some form of\ninitial data will be stable or will instead develop under the turbulent\ninstability into a black hole in the limit of vanishing amplitude. Previous\nwork suggested the existence of islands of stability around quasiperiodic\nsolutions, and we use this new code to examine the stability properties of\napproximately quasiperiodic solutions which balance energy transfer to higher\nmodes with energy transfer to lower modes. The evolutions provide some\nevidence, though not conclusively, for stability of initial data sufficiently\nclose to quasiperiodic solutions.\n", "  We consider the classical Calogero-Sutherland system with two types of\ninteracting spin variables. It can be reduced to the standard\nCalogero-Sutherland system, when one of the spin variables vanishes. We\ndescribe the model in the Hitchin approach and prove complete integrability of\nthe system by constructing the Lax pair and the classical $r$-matrix with the\nspectral parameter on a singular curve.\n", "  A new section of databases and programs devoted to double crystallographic\ngroups (point and space groups) has been implemented in the Bilbao\nCrystallographic Server (http://www.cryst.ehu.es). The double crystallographic\ngroups are required in the study of physical systems whose Hamiltonian includes\nspin-dependent terms. In the symmetry analysis of such systems, instead of the\nirreducible representations of the space groups, it is necessary to consider\nthe single- and double-valued irreducible representations of the double space\ngroups. The new section includes databases of symmetry operations (DGENPOS) and\nof irreducible representations of the double (point and space) groups\n(REPRESENTATIONS DPG and REPRESENTATIONS DSG). The tool DCOMPATIBILITY\nRELATIONS provides compatibility relations between the irreducible\nrepresentations of double space groups at different k-vectors of the Brillouin\nzone when there is a group-subgroup relation between the corresponding little\ngroups. The program DSITESYM implements the so-called site-symmetry approach,\nwhich establishes symmetry relations between localized and extended crystal\nstates, using representations of the double groups. As an application of this\napproach, the program BANDREP calculates the band representations and the\nelementary band representations induced from any Wyckoff position of any of the\n230 double space groups, giving information about the properties of these\nbands. Recently, the results of BANDREP have been extensively applied in the\ndescription and the search of topological insulators.\n", "  Atomic-scale understanding of phosphorous donor wave functions underpins the\ndesign and optimisation of silicon based quantum devices. The accuracy of\nlarge-scale theoretical methods to compute donor wave functions is dependent on\ndescriptions of central-cell-corrections, which are empirically fitted to match\nexperimental binding energies, or other quantities associated with the global\nproperties of the wave function. Direct approaches to understanding such\neffects in donor wave functions are of great interest. Here, we apply a\ncomprehensive atomistic theoretical framework to compute scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy (STM) images of subsurface donor wave functions with two\ncentral-cell-correction formalisms previously employed in the literature. The\ncomparison between central-cell models based on real-space image features and\nthe Fourier transform profiles indicate that the central-cell effects are\nvisible in the simulated STM images up to ten monolayers below the silicon\nsurface. Our study motivates a future experimental investigation of the\ncentral-cell effects via STM imaging technique with potential of fine tuning\ntheoretical models, which could play a vital role in the design of donor-based\nquantum systems in scalable quantum computer architectures.\n", "  Higher mass dimension terms in an effective field theory framework for tests\nof spacetime symmetries are studied. Using a post-Newtonian expansion method,\nwe derive the spacetime metric and the equations of motion for a binary system.\nThis reveals an inverse cubic force correction to General Relativity that\ndepends on the velocity of the bodies in the system. The results are studied in\nthe context of laboratory and space-based tests including the effects on\nsolar-system ephemeris, laser ranging observations, and gravimeter tests. This\nwork reveals the coefficient combinations for mass dimension 5 operators\ncontrolling CPT violation for gravity that can be measured using analysis from\nthese tests. Other tests including light propagation can be used to probe these\ncoefficients. Sensitivity estimates are provided and the results are contrasted\nwith the minimal mass dimension 4 terms in the gravity sector.\n", "  I describe our team's development of the SpeX Prism Library Analysis Toolkit\n(SPLAT), a combined spectral data repository for over 2500 low-resolution\nspectra of very low mass dwarfs (late M, L and T dwarfs), and Python-based\nanalysis toolkit. SPLAT was constructed through a collaborative,\nstudent-centered, research-based model with high school, undergraduate and\ngraduate students and regional K-12 science teachers. The toolkit enables\nspectral index analysis, classification, spectrophotometry, atmosphere model\ncomparison, population synthesis, and other analyses. I summarize the current\ncomponents of this code, sample applications, and future development plans.\n", "  The two-dimensional ferroelectrics GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe are expected to\nhave large spontaneous in-plane electric polarization and enhanced\nshift-current response. Using density functional methods, we show that these\nmaterials also exhibit the largest effective second harmonic generation\nreported so far. It can reach magnitudes up to $10$ nm/V which is about an\norder of magnitude larger than that of prototypical GaAs. To rationalize this\nresult we model the optical response with a simple one-dimensional two-band\nmodel along the spontaneous polarization direction. Within this model the\nsecond-harmonic generation tensor is proportional to the shift-current response\ntensor. The large shift current and second harmonic responses of GeS, GeSe, SnS\nand SnSe make them promising non-linear materials for optoelectronic\napplications.\n", "  In this paper we study the effects of hybridization in the superconducting\nproperties of a two-band system. We consider the cases that these bands are\nformed by electronic orbitals with angular momentum, such that, the\nhybridization $V(\\mathbf{k})$ among them can be symmetric or antisymmetric\nunder inversion symmetry. We take into account only intra-band attractive\ninteractions in the two bands and investigate the appearance of an induced\ninter-band pairing gap. We show that (inter-band) superconducting orderings are\ninduced in the total absence of attractive interaction between the two bands,\nwhich turns out to be completely dependent on the hybridization between them.\nFor the case of antisymmetric hybridization we show that the induced inter-band\nsuperconductivity has a p-wave symmetry.\n", "  We study models in which neutrino masses are generated dynamically at\ncosmologically late times. Our study is purely phenomenological and\nparameterized in terms of three effective parameters characterizing the\nredshift of mass generation, the width of the transition region, and the\npresent day neutrino mass. We also study the possibility that neutrinos become\nstrongly self-interacting at the time where the mass is generated. We find that\nin a number of cases, models with large present day neutrino masses are allowed\nby current CMB, BAO and supernova data. The increase in the allowed mass range\nmakes it possible that a non-zero neutrino mass could be measured in direct\ndetection experiments such as KATRIN. Intriguingly we also find that there are\nallowed models in which neutrinos become strongly self-interacting around the\nepoch of recombination.\n", "  An imposed chemical potential gradient $A_\\uparrow=d\\mu_\\uparrow/dx$ on a\nsingle fermionic species (\"spin up\") directly produces a gradient in the\ndensity $d\\rho_\\uparrow/dx$ across a lattice. We study here the induced density\ninhomogeneity $d\\rho_\\downarrow/dx$ in the second fermionic species (\"spin\ndown\") which results from fermionic interactions $U$, even in the absence of a\nchemical potential gradient $A_\\downarrow=0$ on that species. The magnitude of\n$d\\rho_\\downarrow/dx$ acquired by the second species grows with $U$, while the\nmagnitude of $d\\rho_\\uparrow/dx$ remains relatively constant, that is, set only\nby $A_\\uparrow$. For a given $A_\\uparrow$, we find an interaction strength\n$U_*$ above which the two density gradients are equal in magnitude. We also\nevaluate the spin-spin correlations and show that, as expected,\nantiferromagnetism is most dominant at locations where the local density is\nhalf-filled. The spin polarization induced by sufficiently large gradients, in\ncombination with $U$, drives ferromagnetic behavior. In the case of repulsive\ninteractions, $d\\rho_\\downarrow/dx = -d\\rho_\\uparrow/dx$. A simple\nparticle-hole transformation determines the related effect in the case of\nattractive interactions.\n", "  We investigate mechanical mode coupling between the four fundamental flexural\nmodes of two doubly-clamped, high-Q silicon-nitride nanomechanical string\nresonators. Strong mechanical coupling between the strings is induced by the\nstrain mediated via a shared clamping point, engineered to increase the\nexchange of oscillatory energy. One of the resonators is controlled\ndielectrically, which results in strong coupling between its out-of-plane and\nin-plane flexural modes. We show both, inter-string out-of-plane-in-plane and\n3-mode resonance of the four coupled fundamental vibrational modes of a\nresonator pair, giving rise to a simple and a multimode avoided crossing,\nrespectively.\n", "  Second-stage laser cooling of thulium atoms at the 530.7 nm transition with a\nnatural linewidth of 350 kHz offers an interesting possibility to study\ndifferent regimes of a magneto-optical trap (MOT). The intermediate value of\nthe spectral linewidth of the cooling transition allows the observation of\nthree distinct regimes depending on intensity and detuning of the cooling\nbeams. Namely, the \"bowl-shaped\" regime when light pressure force competes with\ngravity, the \"double structure\" regime with interplay between Doppler and\npolarization-gradient (sub-Doppler) cooling, and the \"symmetric\" regime when\nDoppler cooling dominates over sub-Doppler cooling and gravity. The\npolarization-gradient cooling manifests itself by a two-temperature momentum\ndistribution of atoms resulting in a double-structure of the spatial MOT\nprofile consisting of a cold central fraction surrounded by a hot halo. We\nstudied the \"double structure\" regime at different saturation parameters and\ncompared observations with calculations based on semiclassical and quantum\napproaches. The quantum treatment adequately reproduces experimental results if\nthe MOT magnetic field is properly taken into account.\n", "  Variability on external conditions has important consequences for the\ndynamics and the organization of biological systems. In many cases, the\ncharacteristic timescale of environmental changes as well as their correlations\nplay a fundamental role in the way living systems adapt and respond to it. A\nproper mathematical approach to understand population dynamics, thus, requires\napproaches more refined than, e.g., simple white-noise approximations. To shed\nfurther light onto this problem, in this paper we propose a unifying framework\nbased on different analytical and numerical tools available to deal with\n\"colored\" environmental noise. In particular, we employ a \"unified colored\nnoise approximation\" to map the original problem into an effective one with\nwhite noise, and then we apply a standard path integral approach to gain\nanalytical understanding. For the sake of specificity, we present our approach\nusing as a guideline a variation of the contact process--which can also be seen\nas a birth-death process of the Malthus-Verhulst class--where the propagation\nor birth rate varies stochastically in time. Our approach allows us to tackle\nin a systematic manner some of the relevant questions concerning population\ndynamics under environmental variability, such as determining the stationary\npopulation density, establishing the conditions under which a population may\nbecome extinct, and estimating extinction times. We focus on the emerging phase\ndiagram and its possible phase transitions, underlying how these are affected\nby the presence of environmental noise time-correlations.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of Fe adatoms and dimers deposited on the Cu(111)\nmetallic surface in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, within time-dependent\ndensity functional theory. The \\textit{ab initio} results provide\nmaterial-dependent parameters that can be used in semiclassical approaches,\nwhich are used for insightful interpretations of the excitation modes. By\nmanipulating the surroundings of the magnetic elements, we show that elliptical\nprecessional motion may be induced through the modification of the magnetic\nanisotropy energy. We also demonstrate how different kinds of spin precession\nare realized, considering the symmetry of the magnetic anisotropy energy, the\nferro- or antiferromagnetic nature of the exchange coupling between the\nimpurities, and the strength of the magnetic damping. In particular, the normal\nmodes of a dimer depend on the initial magnetic configuration, changing\ndrastically by going from a ferromagnetic metastable state to the\nantiferromagnetic ground state. By taking into account the effect of the\ndamping into their resonant frequencies, we reveal that an important\ncontribution arises for strongly biaxial systems and specially for the\nantiferromagnetic dimers with large exchange couplings. Counter intuitively,\nour results indicate that the magnetic damping influences the quantum\nfluctuations by decreasing the zero-point energy of the system.\n", "  We briefly review the main channels of gamma ray and neutrino production due\nto the propagation of ultra high energy cosmic rays. We show how the\nobservations of these secondary radiations are of paramount importance in\ntagging mass composition and sources of ultra high energy cosmic rays.\n", "  We propose a novel computational method to extract information about\ninteractions among individuals with different behavioral states in a biological\ncollective from ordinary video recordings. Assuming that individuals are acting\nas finite state machines, our method first detects discrete behavioral states\nof those individuals and then constructs a model of their state transitions,\ntaking into account the positions and states of other individuals in the\nvicinity. We have tested the proposed method through applications to two\nreal-world biological collectives: termites in an experimental setting and\nhuman pedestrians in a university campus. For each application, a robust\ntracking system was developed in-house, utilizing interactive human\nintervention (for termite tracking) or online agent-based simulation (for\npedestrian tracking). In both cases, significant interactions were detected\nbetween nearby individuals with different states, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n", "  Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS$_2$ and\nWSe$_2$ are emerging as a new platform for exploring many-body effects. Coulomb\ninteractions are markedly enhanced in these materials because of the reduced\nscreening and the large Wigner-Seitz radii. Although many-body excitonic\neffects in TMDCs have been extensively studied by optical means, not until\nrecently did probing their strongly correlated electronic effects become\npossible in transport. Here, in p-type few-layer WSe$_2$ we observe highly\ndensity-dependent quantum Hall states of {\\Gamma} valley holes below 12 T,\nwhose predominant sequences alternate between odd- and even-integers. By\ntilting the magnetic field to induce Landau level crossings, we show that the\nstrong Coulomb interaction enhances the Zeeman-to-cyclotron energy ratio from\n2.67 to 3.55 as the density is reduced from 5.7 to 4.0$\\times$10$^{12}$\ncm$^{-2}$, giving rise to the even-odd alternation. Unprecedentedly, this\nindicates a 4.8 times enhancement of the g-factor over its band theory value at\na density as high as 4.0$\\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. Our findings unambiguously\ndemonstrate that p-type few-layer WSe$_2$ is a superior platform for exploring\nstrongly correlated electronic phenomena, opening a new perspective for\nrealizing the elusive Wigner crystallization at a moderate density.\n", "  We consider a two dimensional quantum Hamiltonian separable in Cartesian\ncoordinates and allowing a fifth-order integral of motion. We impose the\nsuperintegrablity condition and find all doubly exotic superintegrable\npotentials (i.e potentials V (x, y) = V_1(x)+V_2(y) where neither V_1(x) nor\nV_2(y) satisfy a linear ODE) allowing the existence of such an integral. All of\nthese potentials are found to have the Painlev\\'e property. Most of them are\nexpressed in terms of known Painlev\\'e transcendents or elliptic functions but\nsome may represent new higher order Painlev\\'e transcendents.\n", "  We report the effect of Se substitution on the crystal structure and\nsuperconductivity of BiCh2-based (Ch: S, Se) layered compounds\nEu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2-xSex (x = 0-1). Crystal structure analysis showed that both\nlattice constants, a and c, increased with increasing x, which is different\nfrom the related La-doped system, such as Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. This is due to\nSe substitution for both in-plane and out-of-plane Ch sites in the present\nCe-doped system. Zero resistivity was observed for x = 0.2-1 above 2 K.\nSuperconducting properties of Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2-xSex was investigated by magnetic\nsusceptibility, and the highest superconducting transition temperature of 3.5 K\nwas obtained for x = 0.6 with a large shielding volume fraction. The emergence\nof bulk superconductivity and metallic conductivity can be qualitatively\ndescribed in terms of increased in-plane chemical pressure effect. A magnetic\nanomaly below 8 K, probably because of ferromagnetic order of magnetic moment\nof Ce3+ ions, coexists with bulk superconductivity in BiCh2 layer. Since the\neffect of Se substitution on the magnetic transition temperature is ignorable,\nwe suggest that the coupling between the magnetic order at the (Eu,Ce)F layer\nand superconductivity at the Bi(S,Se)2 layer is weak.\n", "  We have investigated the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 using neutron\ndiffraction and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. From structural refinements, we\nfound that the two metal sites, occupied by Bi and Pb, were differently\nsurrounded by the sulfur atoms. Calculated bond valence sum suggested that one\nmetal site was nearly trivalent and the other was nearly divalent. Neutron\ndiffraction also revealed site selectivity of Bi and Pb in the LaOBiPbS3\nstructure. These results suggested that the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 can\nbe regarded as alternate stacks of the rock-salt-type Pb-rich sulfide layers\nand the LaOBiS2-type Bi-rich layers. From band calculations for an ideal\n(LaOBiS2)(PbS) system, we found that the S bands of the PbS layer were\nhybridized with the Bi bands of the BiS plane at around the Fermi energy, which\nresulted in the electronic characteristics different from that of LaOBiS2.\nStacking the rock-salt type sulfide (chalcogenide) layers and the BiS2-based\nlayered structure could be a new strategy to exploration of new BiS2-based\nlayered compounds, exotic two-dimensional electronic states, or novel\nfunctionality.\n", "  The momentum distribution and atomic kinetic energy of the two isotopes of\nhelium in a liquid mixture at temperature T=2 K are computed by quantum Monte\nCarlo simulations. Quantum statistics is fully included for He-4, whereas He-3\natoms are treated as distinguishable. Comparison of theoretical estimates with\na collection of the most recent experimental measurements shows reasonable\nagreement for the energetics of He-4 and pure He-3. On the other hand, a\nsignificant discrepancy (already observed in previous works) is reported\nbetween computed and measured values of the He-3 kinetic energy in the mixture,\nin the limit of low He-3 concentration. We assess quantitatively the importance\nof Fermi statistics and find it to be negligible for a He-3 concentration less\nthan approximately 20%. Our results for the momentum distributions lend support\nto what already hypothesized by other authors, namely that the discrepancy is\nlikely due to underestimation of the He-3 kinetic energy contribution\nassociated with the tail of the experimentally measured momentum distribution.\n", "  We systematically construct ghost-free higher-derivative actions of Abelian\nvector supermultiplets in four-dimensional ${\\cal N}=1$ global supersymmetric\ntheories. After giving a simple example which illustrates that a naive\nintroduction of a higher-derivative term gives rise to a ghost, we discuss\npossible building blocks for a ghost-free action and explicitly show that their\nbosonic parts have no ghost mode and the auxiliary field $\\boldsymbol{D}$ does\nnot propagate. Higher-derivative terms yield higher powers of the auxiliary\nfield $\\boldsymbol{D}$ in the actions, and the D-term equations of motion\nconsequently admit multiple solutions in general. We confirm that the\nwell-known supersymmetric Dirac-Born-Infeld action falls into this class. We\nfurther give another example in which the standard quadratic kinetic term\n(Maxwell term) is corrected by a quartic term of the field strength. We also\ndiscuss possible couplings to matter fields and a deformed D-term potential.\n", "  On 21 August 2017 a total solar eclipse swept across the contiguous United\nStates providing excellent opportunities for diagnostics of the Sun's corona.\nThe Sun's coronal structure is notoriously difficult to observe except during\nsolar eclipses; thus theoretical models must be relied upon for inferring the\nunderlying magnetic structure of the Sun's outer atmosphere. These models are\nnecessary for understanding the role of magnetic fields in the heating of the\ncorona to a million degrees and generation of severe space weather. Here we\npresent a methodology for predicting the structure of the coronal field based\non long-term surface flux transport simulations whose output is utilized to\nextrapolate the coronal magnetic field structures. This prescription was\napplied to the 21 August 2017 solar eclipse. Post-eclipse analysis shows good\nagreement between model simulated and observed coronal structures and their\nlocations on the limb. We demonstrate that slow changes in the Sun's surface\nmagnetic field distribution driven by long-term flux emergence and evolution\ngovern large-scale coronal structures with a (plausibly cycle-phase dependent)\ndynamical memory timescale on the order of few solar rotations -- opening up\nthe possibility of large-scale, global corona predictions at least a month in\nadvance.\n", "  Contributions of the Pierre Auger Collaboration to the 35th International\nCosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2017), 12-20 July 2017, Bexco, Busan, Korea.\n", "  Systems driven away from thermal equilibrium constantly deliver entropy to\ntheir environment. Determining this entropy production requires detailed\ninformation about the system's internal states and dynamics. However, in most\npractical scenarios, only a part of a complex experimental system is accessible\nto an external observer. In order to address this challenge, two notions of\npartial entropy production have been introduced in the literature as a way to\nassign an entropy production to an observed subsystem: one due to Shiraishi and\nSagawa [Phys. Rev. E 91, 012130 (2015)] and another due to Polettini and\nEsposito [arXiv:1703.05715 (2017)]. We show that although both of these schemes\nprovide a lower bound on the total entropy production, the latter -- which\nutilizes an effective thermodynamics description-- gives a better estimate of\nthe total dissipation. Using this effective thermodynamic framework, we\nestablish a partitioning of the total entropy production into two contributions\nthat individually verify integral fluctuation theorems: an observable partial\nentropy production and a hidden entropy production assigned to the unobserved\nsubsystem. Our results offer broad implications for both theoretical and\nempirical systems when only partial information is available.\n", "  In this paper, we classify non-freely acting discrete symmetries of complete\nintersection Calabi- Yau manifolds and their quotients by freely-acting\nsymmetries. These non-freely acting symmetries can appear as symmetries of\nlow-energy theories resulting from string compactifications on these Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds, particularly in the context of the heterotic string. Hence, our\nresults are relevant for four-dimensional model building with discrete\nsymmetries and they give an indication which symmetries of this kind can be\nexpected from string theory. For the 1695 known quotients of complete\nintersection manifolds by freely-acting discrete symmetries, non-freely-acting,\ngeneric symmetries arise in 381 cases and are, therefore, a relatively common\nfeature of these manifolds. We find that 9 different discrete groups appear,\nranging in group order from 2 to 18, and that both regular symmetries and\nR-symmetries are possible.\n", "  We introduce two- and one-dimensional (2D and 1D) systems of two\nlinearly-coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) with the cubic\nself-attraction and harmonic-oscillator (HO) trapping potential in each GPE.\nThe system models a Bose-Einstein condensate with a negative scattering length,\nloaded in a double-pancake trap, combined with the in-plane HO potential. In\naddition to that, the 1D version applies to the light transmission in a\ndual-core waveguide with the Kerr nonlinearity and in-core confinement\nrepresented by the HO potential. The subject of the analysis is spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking in 2D and 1D ground-state (GS, alias fundamental) modes, as\nwell as in 2D vortices and 1D dipole modes (the latter ones do not exist\nwithout the HO potential). By means of the variational approximation and\nnumerical analysis, it is found that both the 2D and 1D systems give rise to a\nsymmetry-breaking bifurcation (SBB) of the supercrtical type. Stability of\nsymmetric states and asymmetric ones, produced by the SBB, is analyzed through\nthe computation of eigenvalues for perturbation modes, and verified by direct\nsimulations. The asymmetric GSs are always stable, while the stability region\nfor vortices shrinks and eventually disappears with the increase of the\nlinear-coupling constant, $ \\kappa $. The SBB in the 2D system does not occur\nif $\\kappa $ is too large (at $\\kappa >\\kappa_{\\max }$); in that case, the\ntwo-component system behaves, essentially, as its single-component counterpart.\nIn the 1D system, both asymmetric and symmetric dipole modes feature an\nadditional oscillatory instability, unrelated to the symmetry breaking. This\ninstability occurs in several regions, which expand with the increase of\n$\\kappa $.\n", "  In this paper we study quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs) that\nare driven by strongly squeezed vacuum noise. We show that for strong squeezing\nsuch a QSDE can be approximated (via a limit in the strong sense) by a QSDE\nthat is driven by a single commuting noise process. We find that the\napproximation has an additional Hamiltonian term.\n", "  We compute the transient dynamics of phonons in contact with high energy\n\"hot\" charge carriers in 12 polar and non-polar semiconductors, using a\nfirst-principles Boltzmann transport framework. For most materials, we find\nthat the decay in electronic temperature departs significantly from a\nsingle-exponential model at times ranging from 1 ps to 15 ps after electronic\nexcitation, a phenomenon concomitant with the appearance of non-thermal\nvibrational modes. We demonstrate that these effects result from the slow\nthermalization within the phonon subsystem, caused by the large heterogeneity\nin the timescales of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions in these\nmaterials. We propose a generalized 2-temperature model accounting for the\nphonon thermalization as a limiting step of electron-phonon thermalization,\nwhich captures the full thermal relaxation of hot electrons and holes in\nsemiconductors. A direct consequence of our findings is that, for\nsemiconductors, information about the spectral distribution of electron-phonon\nand phonon-phonon coupling can be extracted from the multi-exponential behavior\nof the electronic temperature.\n", "  We show that the random number $T_n$ of triangles in a random graph on $n$\nvertices, with a strict constraint on the total number of edges, admits an\nexpansion $T_n = an^3 + bn^2 + F_n$, where $a$ and $b$ are numbers, with the\nmean $\\langle F_n \\rangle = O(n)$ and the standard deviation $\\sigma(T_n)\n=\\sigma(F_n)= O(n^{3/2})$. The presence of a `surface term' $bn^2$ has a\nsignificance analogous to the macroscopic surface effects of materials, and is\nmissing in the model where the edge constraint is removed. We also find the\nsurface effect in other graph models using similar edge constraints.\n", "  We give the first phenomenological predictions of cross sections and\nazimuthal correlations for the inclusive di-hadron production in the full NLA\nBFKL approach. This process shares the same theoretical framework with the well\nkonwn Mueller-Navelet jet production and can be considered a novel and\ncomplementary channel to access the BFKL dynamics at proton colliders.\n", "  We present a novel method to measure precisely the relative spectral response\nof the fluorescence telescopes of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We used a\nportable light source based on a xenon flasher and a monochromator to measure\nthe relative spectral efficiencies of eight telescopes in steps of 5 nm from\n280 nm to 440 nm. Each point in a scan had approximately 2 nm FWHM out of the\nmonochromator. Different sets of telescopes in the observatory have different\noptical components, and the eight telescopes measured represent two each of the\nfour combinations of components represented in the observatory. We made an\nend-to-end measurement of the response from different combinations of optical\ncomponents, and the monochromator setup allowed for more precise and complete\nmeasurements than our previous multi-wavelength calibrations. We find an\noverall uncertainty in the calibration of the spectral response of most of the\ntelescopes of 1.5% for all wavelengths; the six oldest telescopes have larger\noverall uncertainties of about 2.2%. We also report changes in physics\nmeasureables due to the change in calibration, which are generally small.\n", "  The ground state of the quantum kagome antiferromagnet Zn-brochantite,\nZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$SO$_4$, which is one of only a few known spin-liquid (SL)\nrealizations in two or three dimensions, has been described as a gapless SL\nwith a spinon Fermi surface. Employing nuclear magnetic resonance in a broad\nmagnetic-field range down to millikelvin temperatures, we show that in applied\nmagnetic fields this enigmatic state is intrinsically unstable against a SL\nwith a full or a partial gap. A similar instability of the gapless\nFermi-surface SL was previously encountered in an organic triangular-lattice\nantiferromagnet, suggesting a common destabilization mechanism that most likely\narises from spinon pairing. A salient property of this instability is that an\ninfinitesimal field suffices to induce it, as predicted theoretically for some\nother types of gapless SL's.\n", "  The criteria for bosonization of Cooper pairs and novel Bose-liquid\nsuperconductivity and superfluidity in high-$T_c$ cuprates and other pseudogap\nmatters are formulated by using the uncertainty principle and the boson mean\nfield theory. We argue that the BCS-type s- or d-wave superconductivity\noccurring in the fermionic limit of Cooper pairs (which exist in ordinary\nmetals and heavily overdoped cuprates with large Fermi energies) is not\ncharacteristic of underdoped to overdoped cuprates with low Fermi energies. The\nsuperconducting order parameter in high-$T_c$ cuprates and other pseudogap\nmatters cannot be determined as the BCS-like (s- or d-wave) gap. We show that\nthe unconventional superconductivity/superfluidity occurring in the bosonic\nlimit of Cooper pairs exists in low Fermi energy systems where the bosonic\nCooper pairs are formed at a pseudogap temperature T* above the\nuperconducting/superfluid transition temperature $T_c$ and then such bosons\ncondenses into a Bose superfluid at $T_c$. The pair condensation of attracting\nbosons occurs at $T_c$ and then their single particle condensation sets in at\n$T_c^*$ lower than $T_c$ (in three dimensions (3D)) or at T=0 (in two\ndimensions (2D)). The coherent single particle and pair condensates of bosons\nexist as two distinct superfluid phases below $T_c$. By solving the mean field\nequations for high-$T_c$ cuprates, the novel superconducting states (i.e., a\nvortex-like state existing below the temperature $T_v=T^{2D}_c$ lower than T*\nbut higher than $T_c=T^{3D}_c$ and two superconducting phases below $T_c$) and\ntheir properties characterized by the boson superfluid stiffness are determined\nand compared with the key experimental findings. The novel Bose-liquid\nsuperconductivity and superfluidity exists also in other exotic\nsuperconductors/superfluids, including quantum liquids, atomic Fermi gases and\nlow-density nuclear matter.\n", "  In the weak-coupling limit approach to open quantum systems, the presence of\nthe bath is eliminated and accounted for by a master equation that introduces\ndissipative contributions to the system reduced dynamics. Within this\nframework, there are no bath entropy contributions to the entropy balance. We\nshow that, as a consequence, the entropy production fails to be positive for a\nclass of physically legitimate (i.e., completely positive and trace preserving)\nnon-Markovian dynamical maps. Moreover, in the absence of the semigroup\nproperty, if the reduced dynamics has a thermal asymptotic state, this need not\nbe stationary. In this case, even the integrated entropy production becomes\nnegative. These observations imply that, when the conditions leading to reduced\ndynamics of semigroup type are relaxed, a consistent formulation of the second\nlaw of thermodynamics requires that the environment contribution to the entropy\nbalance be explicitly taken into account.\n", "  Hypermetallic alkaline earth (M) oxides of formula MOM have been studied\nunder plasma conditions that preclude insight into their formation mechanism.\nWe present here the application of emerging techniques in ultracold physics to\nthe synthesis of a mixed hypermetallic oxide, BaOCa$^+$. These methods,\naugmented by high-level electronic structure calculations, permit detailed\ninvestigation of the bonding and structure, as well as the mechanism of its\nformation via the barrierless reaction of Ca $(^3P_J)$ with BaOCH$_{3}^+$.\nFurther investigations of the reaction kinetics as a function of collision\nenergy over the range 0.005 K to 30 K and of individual Ca fine-structure\nlevels compare favorably with calculations based on long-range capture theory.\n", "  Using double parabola approximation for a single Bose-Einstein condensate\nconfined between double slabs we proved that in grand canonical ensemble (GCE)\nthe ground state with Robin boundary condition (BC) is favored, whereas in\ncanonical ensemble (CE) our system undergoes from ground state with Robin BC to\nthe one with Dirichlet BC in small-$L$ region and vice versa for large-$L$\nregion and phase transition in space of the ground state is the first order.\nThe surface tension force and Casimir force are also considered in both CE and\nGCE in detail.\n", "  For the recently introduced $\\mu$-deformed analog of Bose gas model\n($\\mu$-Bose gas model), its thermodynamical aspects e.g. total number of\nparticles and the partition function are certain functions of the parameter\n$\\mu$. This basic $\\mu$-dependence of thermodynamics of the $\\mu$-Bose gas\narises through the so-called $\\mu$-calculus, an alternative to the known\n$q$-calculus (Jackson derivative, etc.), so we include main elements of\n$\\mu$-calculus. Likewise, virial expansion of EOS and virial coefficients, the\ninternal energy, specific heat and the entropy of $\\mu$-Bose gas show\n$\\mu$-dependence. Herein, we study thermodynamical geometry of $\\mu$-Bose gas\nmodel and find the singular behavior of (scalar) curvature, signaling for\nBose-like condensation. The critical temperature of condensation $T^{(\\mu)}_c$\ndepending on $\\mu$ is given and compared with the usual $T_c$, and with known\n$T_c^{(p,q)}$ of $p,q$-Bose gas model. Using the results on\n$\\mu$-thermodynamics we argue that the condensate of $\\mu$-Bose gas, like the\nearlier proposed infinite statistics system of particles, can serve for\neffective modeling of dark matter.\n", "  The new heavy vector-like top partner~($T$) is one of typical features of\nmany new physics models beyond the standard model. In this paper we study the\ndiscovery potential of the LHC for the vector-like $T$-quark both in the\nleptonic $T\\to bW$ and $T\\to t_{\\rm lep}Z_{\\rm lep}$ (trilepton) channels at\n$\\sqrt{s}= 14$ TeV in the single production mode. Our analysis is based on a\nsimplified model including a $SU(2)_L$ singlet with charge $2/3$ with only two\nfree parameters, namely the $TWb$ coupling parameter $g^{\\ast}$ and the top\npartner mass $m_T$. The $2\\sigma$ exclusion limits, $3\\sigma$ evidence and the\n$5\\sigma$ discovery reach in the parameter plane of $g^{\\ast}-m_T$, are,\nrespectively, obtained for some typical integrated luminosity at the 14 TeV\nLHC. Finally we analyze the projected sensitivity in terms of the production\ncross section times branching fraction for two decay channel.\n", "  In the class of metrics of a generic conformal structure there exists a\ndistinguishing metric. This was noticed by Albert Einstein in a lesser-known\npaper of 1921 (Berl. Ber., 1921, pp. 261-264). We explore this finding from a\ngeometrical point of view. Then, we obtain a family of scalar conformal\ninvariants of weight 0 for generic pseudo-Riemannian conformal structures $[g]$\nin more than three dimensions. In particular, we define the conformal scalar\ncurvature of $[g]$ and calculate it for some well-known conformal spacetimes,\ncomparing the results with the Ricci scalar and the Kretschmann scalar. In the\ncited paper, Einstein also announced that it is possible to add an scalar\nequation to the field equations of General Relativity.\n", "  Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a computational imaging technique\nwith both high resolution and large field-of-view. However, the effective\nnumerical aperture (NA) achievable with a typical LED panel is ambiguous and\nusually relies on the repeated tests of different illumination NAs. The imaging\nquality of each raw image usually depends on the visual assessments, which is\nsubjective and inaccurate especially for those dark field images. Moreover, the\nacquisition process is really time-consuming.In this paper, we propose a\nSNR-based adaptive acquisition method for quantitative evaluation and adaptive\ncollection of each raw image according to the signal-to-noise ration (SNR)\nvalue, to improve the FPM's acquisition efficiency and automatically obtain the\nmaximum achievable NA, reducing the time of collection, storage and subsequent\ncalculation. The widely used EPRY-FPM algorithm is applied without adding any\nalgorithm complexity and computational burden. The performance has been\ndemonstrated in both USAF targets and biological samples with different imaging\nsensors respectively, which have either Poisson or Gaussian noises model.\nFurther combined with the sparse LEDs strategy, the number of collection images\ncan be shorten to around 25 frames while the former needs 361 images, the\nreduction ratio can reach over 90%. This method will make FPM more practical\nand automatic, and can also be used in different configurations of FPM.\n", "  Using an example of a mixed discrete-continuum representation of charges\nunder the periodic boundary condition, we show that the exact pairwise form of\nthe Ewald sum, which is well-defined even if the system is non-neutral,\nprovides a natural starting point for deriving unambiguous Coulomb energies\nthat must remove all spurious dependence on the choice of the Ewald screening\nfactor.\n", "  We study the stationary photon output and statistics of small lasers. Our\nclosed-form expressions clarify the contribution of collective effects due to\nthe interaction between quantum emitters. We generalize laser rate equations\nand explain photon trapping: a decrease of the photon number output below the\nlasing threshold, derive an expression for the stationary cavity mode\nautocorrelation function $g_2$, which implies that collective effects may\nstrongly influence the photon statistics. We identify conditions for coherent,\nthermal and superthermal radiation, the latter being a unique fingerprint for\ncollective emission in lasers. These generic analytical results agree with\nrecent experiments, complement numerical results, and provide insight into and\ndesign rules for nanolasers.\n", "  In terms of the state-of-the-art first principle computational methods\ncombined with the numerical renormalization group technique the spectroscopic\nproperties of Co adatoms deposited on silicene are analyzed. By establishing an\neffective low-energy Hamiltonian based on first principle calculations, we\nstudy the behavior of the local density of states of Co adatom on external\nparameters, such as magnetic field and gating. It is shown that the Kondo\nresonance with the Kondo temperature of the order of a few Kelvins can emerge\nby fine-tuning the chemical potential. The evolution and splitting of the Kondo\npeak with external magnetic field is also analyzed. Furthermore, it is shown\nthat the spin polarization of adatom's spectral function in the presence of\nmagnetic field can be relatively large, and it is possible to tune the\npolarization and its sign by electrical means.\n", "  We use Fuchsian Reduction to construct singular solutions of Einstein's\nequations which belong to the class of Gowdy spacetimes. The solutions have the\nmaximum number of arbitrary functions. Special cases correspond to polarized,\nor other known solutions. The method provides precise asymptotics at the\nsingularity, which is Kasner-like. All of these solutions are asymptotically\nvelocity-dominated. The results account for the fact that solutions with\nvelocity parameter uniformly greater than one are not observed numerically.\nThey also provide a justification of formal expansions proposed by\nGrubi\\v{s}i\\'c and Moncrief.\n", "  We define the concept of an `open' Markov process, a continuous-time Markov\nchain equipped with specified boundary states through which probability can\nflow in and out of the system. External couplings which fix the probabilities\nof boundary states induce non-equilibrium steady states characterized by\nnon-zero probability currents flowing through the system. We show that these\nnon-equilibrium steady states minimize a quadratic form which we call\n`dissipation.' This is closely related to Prigogine's principle of minimum\nentropy production. We bound the rate of change of the entropy of a driven\nnon-equilibrium steady state relative to the underlying equilibrium state in\nterms of the flow of probability through the boundary of the process.\n  We then consider open Markov processes as morphisms in a symmetric monoidal\ncategory by splitting up their boundary states into certain sets of `inputs'\nand `outputs.' Composition corresponds to gluing the outputs of one such open\nMarkov process onto the inputs of another so that the probability flowing out\nof the first process is equal to the probability flowing into the second. We\nconstruct a `black-box' functor characterizing the behavior of an open Markov\nprocess in terms of the space of possible steady state probabilities and\nprobability currents along the boundary. The fact that this is a functor means\nthat the behavior of a composite open Markov process can be computed by\ncomposing the behaviors of the open Markov processes from which it is composed.\nWe prove a similar black-boxing theorem for reaction networks whose dynamics\nare given by the non-linear rate equation. Along the way we describe a more\ngeneral category of open dynamical systems where composition corresponds to\ngluing together open dynamical systems.\n", "  The Virtual Environment for Neutrinos (VENu) is a virtual reality-based\nvisualisation of the MicroBooNE detector. MicroBooNE is a liquid-argon-based\nneutrino experiment, which is currently operating in Fermilab's Booster\nneutrino beam. The new VENu smartphone app provides informative explanations\nabout neutrinos and uses real MicroBooNE neutrino data that can be visualised\ninside a virtual representation of the MicroBooNE detector. Available for both\niOS and Android, the VENu app can be downloaded for free from the Apple and\nGoogle marketplaces. The app enables users to immerse themselves inside the\nMicroBooNE particle detector and to see particle tracks inside. This can be\ndone in Virtual Reality mode, where the users can pair their smartphone with\nany consumer virtual reality headset and see the detector in 3D. To encourage\nlearning in a fun environment, a game is also available, guiding users to learn\nabout neutrinos and how to detect them. They can also try to \"catch\"' neutrinos\nthemselves in 3D mode. The app is currently being pursued for a QuarkNet\nneutrino master class and outreach events at several universities and labs\nworldwide.\n", "  The plan for the International Linear Collider is now being prepared as a\nstaged design, with the first stage at 250 GeV and later stages achieving the\nfull project specifications with 4 ab-1 at 500 GeV. This talk will present the\ncapabilities for precision Higgs boson measurements at 250 GeV and their\nrelation to the full ILC program. It will show that the 250 GeV stage of ILC\nwill already provide many compelling results in Higgs physics, with new\nmeasurements not available at LHC, model-independent determinations of key\nparameters, and tests for and possible discrimination of a variety of scenarios\nfor new physics.\n", "  A stochastic minimization method for a real-space wavefunction, $\\Psi({\\bf\nr}_{1},{\\bf r}_{2}\\ldots{\\bf r}_{n})$, constrained to a chosen density,\n$\\rho({\\bf r})$, is developed. It enables the explicit calculation of the Levy\nconstrained search\n$F[\\rho]=\\min_{\\Psi\\rightarrow\\rho}\\langle\\Psi|\\hat{T}+\\hat{V}_{ee}|\\Psi\\rangle$\n(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 76 6062 (1979)), that gives the exact functional of\ndensity functional theory. This general method is illustrated in the evaluation\nof $F[\\rho]$ for two-electron densities in one dimension with a soft-Coulomb\ninteraction. Additionally, procedures are given to determine the first and\nsecond functional derivatives, $\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta\\rho({\\bf r})}$ and\n$\\frac{\\delta^{2}F}{\\delta\\rho({\\bf r})\\delta\\rho({\\bf r}')}$. For a chosen\nexternal potential, $v({\\bf r})$, the functional and its derivatives are used\nin minimizations only over densities to give the exact energy, $E_{v}$ without\nneeding to solve the Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  We extend some of the results proved for scalar equations in [3,4], to the\ncase of systems of integrable conservation laws. In particular, for such\nsystems we prove that the eigenvalues of a matrix obtained from the quasilinear\npart of the system are invariants under Miura transformations and we show how\nthese invariants are related to dispersion relations. Furthermore, focusing on\none-parameter families of dispersionless systems of integrable conservation\nlaws associated to the Coxeter groups of rank $2$ found in [1], we study the\ncorresponding integrable deformations up to order $2$ in the deformation\nparameter $\\epsilon$. Each family contains both bi-Hamiltonian and\nnon-Hamiltonian systems of conservation laws and therefore we use it to probe\nto which extent the properties of the dispersionless limit impact the nature\nand the existence of integrable deformations. It turns out that a part two\nvalues of the parameter all deformations of order one in $\\epsilon$ are\nMiura-trivial, while all those of order two in $\\epsilon$ are essentially\nparameterized by two arbitrary functions of single variables (the Riemann\ninvariants) both in the bi-Hamiltonian and in the non-Hamiltonian case. In the\ntwo remaining cases, due to the existence of non-trivial first order\ndeformations, there is an additional functional parameter.\n", "  The topological properties in topological superconductors are usually\ncharacterized by the bulk Chern numbers, edge-state spectra, and Majorana zero\nmodes. Whether they are equivalent or inequivalent is not well understood.\nHere, we investigate this issue with focus on a checkerboard-lattice model\ncombining the Chern insulator and chiral $p$-wave superconductivity. Multiple\ntopologically superconducting phases with Chern numbers up to $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nare produced. We explicitly demonstrate the mismatch between the Chern numbers,\nedge states and Majorana zero modes in this two-dimensional\ntopological-superconductor model. The intrinsic reason is that some edge states\nin the superconducting phases inherited from the Chern-insulator phase are not\nprotected by the particle-hole symmetry. We further check the mismatches in\nvortex states. Our results therefore clarify these different but complementary\ntopological features and suggest that further considerations are required to\ncharacterize various topological superconductors.\n", "  Cancer is an epidemic worldwide. At present one in four persons has cancer\nand this statistic will change to one in a two person in the near future. It is\nnow known that war against cancer is the early, curable detection and\ntreatment. Affordable, quick and easy detection methods are, therefore,\nessential. Standard pathologist way of detecting cancer is looking at the\nstained biopsy tissue samples under microscope, brings lots of human error. A\ntissue is a spatial heterogeneous medium and it has fractal properties due to\nits self-similarity in mass distribution. It is now known that with the\nprogress of cancer the tissue heterogeneity changes due to more mass\naccumulations and rearrangement of intracellular macromolecules such as DNA and\nlipids etc. Furthermore, there are tissue micro array (TMA) samples available\nthat provides array of hundred samples in one glass slides. In this study,\nusing reflectance microscopy we have analyzed the fractal dimension of 5{\\mu}m\ncolon TMA samples to correctly distinguish between normal, adjacent to cancer,\nbenign, stage-1 and stage-2 colon cancers. This fractal property of the tissues\nis also supported by entropy and spatial correlation calculations. The\napplication of this method for diagnostic applications is also discussed.\n", "  Seven of the nine known Mars Trojan asteroids belong to an orbital cluster\nnamed after its largest member 5261 Eureka. Eureka is likely the progenitor of\nthe whole cluster, which formed at least 1 Gyr ago. It was suggested that the\nthermal YORP effect spun-up Eureka resulting with fragments being ejected by\nthe rotational-fission mechanism. Eureka's spectrum exhibits a broad and deep\nabsorption band around 1 {\\mu}m, indicating an olivine-rich composition. Here\nwe show evidence that the Trojan Eureka cluster progenitor could have\noriginated as impact debris excavated from the Martian mantle. We present new\nnear-infrared observations of two Trojans (311999 2007 NS2 and 385250 2001\nDH47) and find that both exhibit an olivine-rich reflectance spectrum similar\nto Eureka's. These measurements confirm that the progenitor of the cluster has\nan achondritic composition. Olivine-rich reflectance spectra are rare amongst\nasteroids but are seen around the largest basins on Mars. They are also\nconsistent with some Martian meteorites (e.g. Chassigny), and with the material\ncomprising much of the Martian mantle. Using numerical simulations, we show\nthat the Mars Trojans are more likely to be impact ejecta from Mars than\ncaptured olivine-rich asteroids transported from the main belt. This result\nlinks directly specific asteroids to debris from the forming planets.\n", "  Traditional concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) systems utilize multijunction\ncells to minimize thermalization losses, but cannot efficiently capture diffuse\nsunlight, which contributes to a high levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and\nlimits their use to geographical regions with high direct sunlight insolation.\nLuminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) harness light generated by luminophores\nembedded in a light-trapping waveguide to concentrate light onto smaller cells.\nLSCs can absorb both direct and diffuse sunlight, and thus can operate as flat\nplate receivers at a fixed tilt and with a conventional module form factor.\nHowever, current LSCs experience significant power loss through parasitic\nluminophore absorption and incomplete light trapping by the optical waveguide.\nHere we introduce a tandem LSC device architecture that overcomes both of these\nlimitations, consisting of a PLMA polymer layer with embedded CdSe/CdS quantum\ndot (QD) luminophores and InGaP micro-cells, which serve as a high bandgap\nabsorber on top of a conventional Si photovoltaic. We experimentally synthesize\nCdSe/CdS QDs with exceptionally high quantum-yield (99%) and ultra-narrowband\nemission optimally matched to fabricated III-V InGaP micro-cells. Using a Monte\nCarlo ray-tracing model, we show the radiative limit power conversion\nefficiency for a module with these components to be 30.8% diffuse sunlight\nconditions. These results indicate that a tandem LSC-on-Si architecture could\nsignificantly improve upon the efficiency of a conventional Si photovoltaic\nmodule with simple and straightforward alterations of the module lamination\nsteps of a Si photovoltaic manufacturing process, with promise for widespread\nmodule deployment across diverse geographical regions and energy markets.\n", "  Twisted electromagnetic waves, of which the helical phase front is called\norbital angular momentum (OAM), have been recently explored for quantum\ninformation, high speed communication and radar detections. In this context,\ngeneration of high purity waves carrying OAM is of great significance and\nchallenge from low frequency band to optical area. Here, a novel strategy of\nmode combination method is proposed to generate twisted waves with arbitrary\norder of OAM index. The higher order mode of a circular horn antenna is used to\ngenerate the twisted waves with quite high purity. The proposed strategy is\nverified with theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experiments. A\ncircular horn antenna operating at millimeter wave band is designed,\nfabricated, and measured. Two twisted waves with OAM index of l=+1 and l=-1\nwith a mode purity as high as 87% are obtained. Compared with the other OAM\nantennas, the antenna proposed here owns a high antenna gain (over 12 dBi) and\nwide operating bandwidth (over 15%). The high mode purity, high antenna gain\nand wide operating band make the antenna suitable for the twisted-wave\napplications, not only in the microwave and millimeter wave band, but also in\nthe terahertz band.\n", "  Freeze-casting produces materials with complex, three-dimensional pore\nstructures which may be tuned during the solidification process. The range of\npotential applications of freeze-cast materials is vast, and includes:\nstructural materials, biomaterials, filtration membranes, pharmaceuticals, and\nfoodstuffs. Fabrication of materials with application-specific microstructures\nis possible via freeze casting, however, the templating process is highly\ncomplex and the underlying principles are only partially understood. Here, we\nreport the creation of a freeze-casting experimental data repository, which\ncontains data extracted from ~800 different freeze-casting papers (as of August\n2017). These data pertain to variables that link processing conditions to\nmicrostructural characteristics, and finally, mechanical properties. The aim of\nthis work is to facilitate broad dissemination of relevant data to\nfreeze-casting researchers, promote better informed experimental design, and\nencourage modeling efforts that relate processing conditions to microstructure\nformation and material properties. An initial, systematic analysis of these\ndata is provided and key processing-structure-property relationships posited in\nthe freeze-casting literature are discussed and tested against the database.\nTools for data visualization and exploration available through the web\ninterface are also provided.\n", "  Scalable fabrication of high quality photodetectors derived from\nsynthetically grown monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides is highly\ndesired and important for wide range of nanophotonics applications. We present\nhere scalable fabrication of monolayer MoS2 photodetectors on sapphire\nsubstrates through an efficient process, which includes growing large scale\nmonolayer MoS2 via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and multi-step optical\nlithography for device patterning and high quality metal electrodes\nfabrication. In every measured device, we observed the following universal\nfeatures: (i) negligible dark current $(I_{dark}\\leqslant10 fA)$; (ii) sharp\npeaks in photocurrent at $\\sim$1.9eV and $\\sim$2.1eV attributable to the\noptical transitions due to band edge excitons; (iii) a rapid onset of\nphotocurrent above $\\sim$2.5eV peaked at $\\sim$2.9eV due to an excitonic\nabsorption originating from the van Hove singularity of MoS$_2$. We observe low\n($\\leqslant 300\\%$) device-to-device variation of photoresponsivity.\nFurthermore, we observe very fast rise time $\\sim$0.5 ms, which is three orders\nof magnitude faster than other reported CVD grown 1L-MoS$_2$ based\nphotodetectors. The combination of scalable device fabrication, ultra-high\nsensitivity and high speed offer a great potential for applications in\nphotonics.\n", "  We use a theoretical approach to reveal the electronic and structural\nproperties of molybdenum impurities between MoS$_{2}$ bilayers. We find that\ninterstitial Mo impurities are able to reverse the well-known stability order\nof the pristine bilayer, because the most stable form of stacking changes from\nAA' (undoped) into AB (doped). The occurrence of Mo impurities in different\npositions shows their split electronic levels in the energy gap, following\noctahedral and tetrahedral crystal fields. The energy stability is related to\nthe accommodation of Mo impurities compacted in hollow sites between layers.\nOther less stable configurations for Mo dopants have larger interlayer\ndistances and band gaps than those for the most stable stacking. Our findings\nsuggest possible applications such as exciton trapping in layers around\nimpurities, and the control of bilayer stacking by Mo impurities in the growth\nprocess.\n", "  Graphene is a very attractive material for broadband photodetection in\nhyperspectral imaging and sensing systems. However, its potential use has been\nhindered by tradeoffs between the responsivity, bandwidth, and operation speed\nof existing graphene photodetectors. Here, we present engineered\nphotoconductive nanostructures based on gold-patched graphene nanoribbons,\nwhich enable simultaneous broadband and ultrafast photodetection with high\nresponsivity. These nanostructures merge the advantages of broadband optical\nabsorption, ultrafast photocarrier transport, and carrier multiplication in\ngraphene nanoribbons with the ultrafast transport of photocarriers to the gold\npatches before recombination. Through this approach, high-responsivity\noperation is achieved without the use of bandwidth- and speed-limiting quantum\ndots, defect states, or tunneling barriers. We demonstrate high-responsivity\nphotodetection from the visible to the infrared regime (0.6 A/W at 0.8 {\\mu}m\nand 11.5 A/W at 20 {\\mu}m) with operation speeds exceeding 50 GHz. Our results\ndemonstrate an improvement of the response times by more than seven orders of\nmagnitude and an increase in bandwidths of one order of magnitude compared to\nthose of higher-responsivity graphene photodetectors based on quantum dots and\ntunneling barriers.\n", "  This paper focuses on performance analyzing and dynamic modeling of the\ncurrent grid-tied fixed array 6.84kW solar photovoltaic system located at\nFlorida Atlantic University (FAU). A battery energy storage system is designed\nand applied to improve the systems stability and reliability. An overview of\nthe entire system and its PV module are presented. In sequel, the corresponding\nI-V and P-V curves are obtained using MATLAB-Simulink package. Actual data was\ncollected and utilized for the modeling and simulation of the system. In\naddition, a grid- connected PV/Battery system with Maximum Power Point Tracking\n(MPPT) controller is modeled to analyze the system performance that has been\nevaluated under two different test conditions: (1) PV power production is\nhigher than the load demand (2) PV generated power is less than required load.\nA battery system has also been sized to provide smoothing services to this\narray. The simulation results show the effective of the proposed method. This\nsystem can be implemented in developing countries with similar weather\nconditions to Florida.\n", "  Conformal techniques, based on the covariance of Maxwell's electrodynamics\nunder the full conformal group in four spacetime dimensions, are discussed in\nrelation with the constant input impedance properties of frequency-independent\nantennas. In particular we show that by applying suitable conformal\ntransformations to existing self-complementary planar structures like\nlogarithmic spirals, the constant input impedance property is considerably\nimproved, specially in the low frequency domain, where it usually fails due to\nthe large wavelength involved. The effect of the conformal transformation is to\nbring infinity up to a finite distance and, in a way, to imprison the otherwise\ninfinite structure in a compact region. This procedure enables to perform a\nmore intelligent truncation with the aim to capture some of the properties left\nbehind in the cutting, and to design realistic ultra width-band antennas with a\nmore controlled value of the input impedance in the whole operation range. Due\nto the fact that the tools here developed find their roots in the differential\ngeometry of curved manifolds, they are quite general and also suitable for\ndealing with 3D-antennas of arbitrary shape, curvature and size, as well as\nwith other systems in which the effects of truncation play a crucial role in\ndefining physical properties of them.\n", "  In the present document a selected sample of the latest results on CP\nviolation by the LHCb collaboration are presented. These include the first\nmeasurement of $\\phi_s^{c\\overline{c}s} = 0.119 \\pm0.107\\pm0.034$ rad in a\nfinal state dominated by a tensor resonance, the most precise measurements of\n$C_{\\pi^+\\pi^-}$ and $S_{\\pi^+\\pi^-}$ to date, the first values ever measured\nof $C_{K^+K^-}$, $S_{K^+K^-}$ and $A_{K^+K^-}^{\\Delta\\Gamma}$, the latest\nconstraints on $\\gamma = (76.8^{+5.1}_{-5.7})^\\circ$ from the combination of\nseveral LHCb results and the first evidence for CP violation in baryonic mater\nat the level of 3.3$\\sigma$. All results show a good agreement with the SM\nexpectations.\n", "  Historically, high energy physics computing has been performed on large\npurpose-built computing systems. These began as single-site compute facilities,\nbut have evolved into the distributed computing grids used today. Recently,\nthere has been an exponential increase in the capacity and capability of\ncommercial clouds. Cloud resources are highly virtualized and intended to be\nable to be flexibly deployed for a variety of computing tasks. There is a\ngrowing nterest among the cloud providers to demonstrate the capability to\nperform large-scale scientific computing. In this paper, we discuss results\nfrom the CMS experiment using the Fermilab HEPCloud facility, which utilized\nboth local Fermilab resources and virtual machines in the Amazon Web Services\nElastic Compute Cloud. We discuss the planning, technical challenges, and\nlessons learned involved in performing physics workflows on a large-scale set\nof virtualized resources. In addition, we will discuss the economics and\noperational efficiencies when executing workflows both in the cloud and on\ndedicated resources.\n", "  Effective passivation of lithium metal surfaces, and prevention of\nbattery-shorting lithium dendrite growth, are critical for implementing\nlithium-metal-anodes for batteries with increased power densities. Nanoscale\nsurface heterogeneities can be \"hot spots\" where anode passivation breaks down.\nMotivated by the observation of lithium dendrites in pores and grain boundaries\nin all-solid batteries, we examine lithium metal surfaces covered with Li(2)O\nand/or LiF thin films with grain boundaries in them. Electronic structure\ncalculations show that, at >0.25 V computed equilibrium overpotential, L(2)O\ngrain boundaries with sufficiently large pores can accommodate Li(0) atoms\nwhich aid electron leakage and passivation breakdown. Strain often accompanies\nLi-insertion, applying a ~1.7% strain already lowers the computed overpotential\nto 0.1 V. Lithium metal nanostructures as thin as 12 Angstroms are\nthermodynamically favored inside cracks in Li(2)O films, becoming \"incipient\nlithium filaments.\" LiF films are more resistant to lithium metal growth. The\nmodels used herein should in turn inform passivating strategies in\nall-solid-state batteries.\n", "  We argue that lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays $M \\to \\ell_1\n\\overline{\\ell}_2$ of meson states $M$ with different quantum numbers could be\nused to put constraints on the Wilson coefficients of effective operators\ndescribing LFV interactions at low energy scales. We note that the restricted\nkinematics of the two-body decay of quarkonium or a heavy quark meson allows us\nto select operators with particular quantum numbers, significantly reducing the\nreliance on the $single \\ operator \\ dominance$ assumption that is prevalent in\nconstraining parameters of the effective LFV Lagrangian. We shall also argue\nthat studies of radiative lepton flavor violating $M \\to \\gamma \\ell_1\n\\overline{\\ell}_2$ decays could provide important complementary access to those\neffective operators.\n", "  Crystal symmetry of two-dimensional (2D) materials plays an important role in\ntheir electronic and optical properties. Engineering symmetry in 2D materials\nhas recently emerged as a promising way to achieve novel properties and\nfunctions. The noncentrosymmetric structure of monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), has allowed for\nvalley control via circularly polarized optical excitation. In bilayer TMDCs,\ninversion symmetry can be controlled by varying the stacking sequence, thus\nproviding a pathway to engineer valley selectivity. Here, we report the in situ\nintegration of AA' and AB stacked bilayer MoS2 with different inversion\nsymmetries by creating atomically sharp stacking boundaries between the\ndifferently stacked domains, via thermal stimulation and electron irradiation,\ninside an atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. The\nsetup enables us to track the formation and atomic motion of the stacking\nboundaries in real time and with ultrahigh resolution which enables in-depth\nanalysis on the atomic structure at the boundaries. In conjunction with density\nfunctional theory calculations, we establish the dynamics of the boundary\nnucleation and expansion and further identify metallic boundary states. Our\napproach provides a means to synthesize domain boundaries with intriguing\ntransport properties and opens up a new avenue for controlling valleytronics in\nnanoscale domains via real-time patterning of domains with different symmetry\nproperties.\n", "  Quarkonium is the bound state of a heavy quark and its anti-quark\ncounterpart. The study of this system has experienced a renaissance thanks to\nresults from e+e- collider experiments, including discoveries of long-predicted\nconventional quarkonia, and unusual states consisting of four quarks. The Belle\nExperiment operated at KEK in Japan from 1999-2010. Analysis of the collected\ndata continues to produce new findings. The Belle II experiment is a\nsubstantial upgrade of both the Belle detector and the KEKB accelerator, aiming\nto collect 50 times more data beginning in 2018. This talk presented recent\nBelle results related to hadronic and radiative decays in the bottomonium\nsystem. It described the capabilities of Belle II to explore these topics, with\na particular focus on the physics reach of the first data, where unique\nopportunities exist to make an immediate impact in this area.\n", "  Studies suggests that patients with deep vein thrombosis and diabetes often\nhave hy-per coagulable blood plasma leading to higher chances of forming\nthromboembolisms by the rupture of blood clots, which may lead to stroke and\ndeath. Despite the advances in the field of blood clot formation and lysis\nresearch, the change in mechanical properties and its impli-cation into the\nformation of thromboembolisms in platelet poor plasma is poorly understood. In\nthis paper, we present a new computational method to simulate fibrin clot\nformation using molecular simulations. With an effective combination of\nreactive molecular dynamics con-cept and coarse graining principle, we have\nutilized the reactive coarse grain molecular dy-namics to predict the complex\nnetwork formation of fibrin clots and the branching of the fi-brins. The heavy\n340 kDa fibrinogen is converted into a simple spring-bead coarse grain sys-tem\nwith 9 beads, and using our customized reactive potentials, we simulated the\nformation of the fibrin clot. Thus, formed fibrin clot agrees with the\nexperimental results qualitatively, and to our best knowledge this is the first\nkind of molecular polymerization study of fibrin clot which can lead to improve\nour understanding about blood clot formation and its relation-ship with\nmechanical properties.\n", "  The incorporation of electrically tunable materials into photonic structures\nsuch as waveguides and metasurfaces enables dynamic control of light\npropagation by an applied potential. While many materials have been shown to\nexhibit electrically tunable permittivity and dispersion, including transparent\nconducting oxides (TCOs) and III-V semiconductors and quantum wells, these\nmaterials are all optically isotropic in the propagation plane. In this work,\nwe report the first known example of electrically tunable linear dichroism,\nobserved here in few-layer black phosphorus (BP), which is a promising\ncandidate for multi-functional, broadband, tunable photonic elements. We\nmeasure active modulation of the linear dichroism from the mid-infrared to\nvisible frequency range, which is driven by anisotropic quantum-confined Stark\nand Burstein-Moss effects, and field-induced forbidden-to-allowed optical\ntransitions. Moreover, we observe high BP absorption modulation strengths,\napproaching unity for certain thicknesses and photon energies.\n", "  The effect of three-spin interaction k on thermal entanglement between\nalternate qubits is studied using pairwise concurrence C and energy level\ndiagram. It is found that k breaks the symmetry about the effect of magnetic\nfield h on C. It shifts a dip structure and gradually effaces a boot structure\nwhen |k|<|J| (J is spin exchange coupling). A peak with C maintains 1 appears\nand expands, elbowing the dip backwards when |k|>|J|. A sudden change of the\nconcurrence occurs around |k|=|J|, h=-k. Similar conclusions about\nnearest-neighbor qubits are directly given.\n", "  Self-assembled aggregates of pigment molecules are potential building blocks\nfor excitonic circuits that find their application in energy conversion and\noptical signal processing. Recent experimental studies of one-dimensional\nheterotriangulene supramolecular aggregates suggested that singlet excitons in\nthese structures can propagate on several micron distances. We explore this\npossibility theoretically by combining electronic structure calculations with\nmicroscopic models for exciton transport. Detailed characterization of the\nstructural disorder and exciton decoherence is provided. We argue that\nconventional exciton transport models give about an order of magnitude shorter\nestimates for the exciton propagation length which suggest that there are other\npossible explanations of the experimental results.\n", "  The coalescence of a stellar-mass compact object together with an\nintermediate-mass black hole, also known as intermediate-mass-ratio inspiral,\nis usually not expected to be a viable gravitational wave source for the\ncurrent ground-based gravitational wave detectors, due to the generally lower\nfrequency of such source. In this paper, we adopt the effective-one-body\nformalism as the equation of motion, and obtain the accurately calculated\ngravitational waveforms by solving the Teukolsky equation in frequency-domain.\nWe point out that high frequency modes of gravitational waves can be excited by\nlarge eccentricities of intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals. These high frequency\nmodes can extend to more than 10 Hz, and enter the designed sensitive band of\nAdvanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We propose that such kind of highly eccentric\nintermediate-mass-ratio inspirals could be feasible sources and potentially\nobservable by the ground-based gravitational wave detectors, like the Advanced\nLIGO and Advanced Virgo.\n", "  We performed terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, low-frequency Raman\nscattering, and Brillouin light scattering on vitreous glucose to investigate\nthe boson peak (BP) dynamics. In the spectra of {\\alpha}({\\nu})/{\\nu}2\n[{\\alpha}({\\nu}) is the absorption coefficient], the BP is clearly observed\naround 1.1 THz. Correspondingly, the complex dielectric constant spectra show a\nuniversal resonancelike behavior only below the BP frequency. As an analytical\nscheme, we propose the relative light-vibration coupling coefficient (RCC),\nwhich is obtainable from the combination of the far-infrared and Raman spectra.\nThe RCC reveals that the infrared light-vibration coupling coefficient\nCIR({\\nu}) of the vitreous glucose behaves linearly on frequency which deviates\nfrom Taraskin's model of CIR({\\nu}) = A + B{\\nu}2 [S. N. Taraskin et al., Phys.\nRev. Lett. 97, 055504 (2006)]. The linearity of CIR({\\nu}) might require\nmodification of the second term of the model. The measured transverse sound\nvelocity shows an apparent discontinuity with the flattened mode observed in\nthe inelastic neutron scattering study [N. Violini et al., Phys. Rev. B 85,\n134204 (2012)] and suggests a coupling between the transverse acoustic and\nflattened modes.\n", "  We study the optical transmission of a waveguide that is side-coupled to a\nhigh-$Q$ circular microresonator. The coupling is critical if the intrinsic\nresonator losses equate the coupling losses to the waveguide. When this\nhappens, the transmittance of the waveguide displays resonance dips with\nmaximal depth as the frequency is swept through the resonators resonances. We\nshow that multiple configurations, parameterised by the minimal distance\nbetween the resonator and the waveguide, can lead to critical coupling. Indeed,\nfor a sufficiently large resonator radius, the flow of power between the\nwaveguide and the resonator can change sign several times within a single pass.\nThis leads to an oscillatory coupling parameter as a function of the separation\ndistance. As a result, multiple geometrical configurations can lead to critical\ncoupling, even if the waveguide lies in the equatorial plane of the resonator.\nThese results are explained using coupled-mode theory and full wave numerical\nsimulations. In the vicinity of secondary or higher-order critical coupling,\nthe depth of the transmittance dip is very sensitive to the environment. We\ndiscuss how this effect can be exploited for sensing purpose. Alternatively, by\nactively controlling the environment in the secondary critical configuration,\nthe waveguide/resonator system can be driven as an optical switch.\n", "  Water and glycerol are well-known to facilitate the structural relaxation of\namorphous protein matrices. However, several studies evidenced that they may\nalso limit fast ($\\sim$ pico-nanosecond, ps-ns) and small-amplitude ($\\sim$ \\AA\n) motions of proteins, which govern their stability in freeze-dried sugar\nmixtures. To determine how they interact with proteins and sugars in glassy\nmatrices and, thereby, modulate their fast dynamics, we performed molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations of lysozyme/trehalose/glycerol (LTG) and\ntrehalose/glycerol (TG) mixtures at low glycerol and water concentrations. Upon\naddition of glycerol and/or water, the glass transition temperature,\nT$_{\\textrm{g}}$, of LTG and TG mixtures decreases, the molecular packing of\nglasses is improved, and the mean-square displacements (MSDs) of lysozyme and\ntrehalose either decrease or increase, depending on the time scale and on the\ntemperature considered. A detailed analysis of the hydrogen bonds (HBs) formed\nbetween species reveals that water and glycerol may antiplasticize the fast\ndynamics of lysozyme and trehalose by increasing the total number and/or the\nstrength of the HBs they form in glassy matrices.\n", "  We present the design and commissioning of Project Solaris, a global network\nof autonomous observatories. Solaris is a Polish scientific undertaking aimed\nat the detection and characterization of circumbinary exoplanets and eclipsing\nbinary stars. To accomplish this, a network of four fully autonomous\nobservatories has been deployed in the Southern Hemisphere: Solaris-1 and\nSolaris-2 in the South African Astronomical Observatory in South Africa;\nSolaris-3 in Siding Spring Observatory in Australia; and Solaris-4 in Complejo\nAstronomico El Leoncito in Argentina. The four stations are nearly identical\nand are equipped with 0.5-m Ritchey-Cr\\'etien (f/15) or Cassegrain (f/9,\nSolaris-3) optics and high-grade 2 K x 2 K CCD cameras with Johnson and Sloan\nfilter sets. We present the design and implementation of low-level security;\ndata logging and notification systems; weather monitoring components; all-sky\nvision system, surveillance system; and distributed temperature and humidity\nsensors. We describe dedicated grounding and lighting protection system design\nand robust fiber data transfer interfaces in electrically demanding conditions.\nWe discuss the outcomes of our design, as well as the resulting software\nengineering requirements. We describe our system's engineering approach to\nachieve the required level of autonomy, the architecture of the custom\nhigh-level industry-grade software that has been designed and implemented\nspecifically for the use of the network. We present the actual status of the\nproject and first photometric results; these include data and models of already\nstudied systems for benchmarking purposes (Wasp-4b, Wasp-64b, and Wasp-98b\ntransits, PG 1663-018, an eclipsing binary with a pulsator) as well\nJ024946-3825.6, an interesting low-mass binary system for which a complete\nmodel is provided for the first time.\n", "  A tutorial introduction to the Kondo effect, the RKKY interaction, and a\nrenormalization group treatment to analyze the competition between the two.\n", "  This paper describes a new algorithm for solar energy forecasting from a\nsequence of Cloud Optical Depth (COD) images. The algorithm is based on the\nfollowing simple observation: the dynamics of clouds represented by COD images\nresembles the motion (transport) of a density in a fluid flow. This suggests\nthat, to forecast the motion of COD images, it is sufficient to forecast the\nflow. The latter, in turn, can be accomplished by fitting a parametric model of\nthe fluid flow to the COD images observed in the past. Namely, the learning\nphase of the algorithm is composed of the following steps: (i) given a sequence\nof COD images, the snapshots of the optical flow are estimated from two\nconsecutive COD images; (ii) these snapshots are then assimilated into a\nNavier-Stokes Equation (NSE), i.e. an initial velocity field for NSE is\nselected so that the corresponding NSE' solution is as close as possible to the\noptical flow snapshots. The prediction phase consists of utilizing a linear\ntransport equation, which describes the propagation of COD images in the fluid\nflow predicted by NSE, to estimate the future motion of the COD images. The\nalgorithm has been tested on COD images provided by two geostationary\noperational environmental satellites from NOAA serving the west-hemisphere.\n", "  Silicon lasers have been the most challenging element for the monolithic\nintegrated Si photonics. Here we report the first successful all-Si laser at\nroom temperature based on silicon nanocrystals (Si NCs) with high optical\ngains. The active Si NC layer was made from hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) that\nhad undergone a phase separation annealing, followed by high-pressure hydrogen\npassivation. Using the nanoimprint technique, a second-order Bragg grating was\nmade on the active layer as the distributed feedback (DFB) laser cavity. This\nSi NC DFB laser device was optically pumped with femtosecond pulses. Criteria\nfor lasing action, i.e., the threshold effect, the polarization dependence and\nthe significant spectral narrowing of stimulated emission were evidently\nfulfilled, which indicated the realization of an all-Si laser.\n", "  It is often assumed that the maximum number of independent states a black\nhole may contain is $N_{BH}=e^{S_{BH}}$, where $S_{BH}=A/4$ is the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy and $A$ the horizon area in Planck units. I present\na simple and straightforward argument showing that the number of states that\ncan be distinguished by local observers inside the hole must be greater than\nthis number.\n", "  Exact pieces of information on the adiabatic connection integrand\n$W_{\\lambda}[\\rho]$, which allows to evaluate the exchange-correlation energy\nof Kohn-Sham density functional theory, can be extracted from the leading terms\nin the strong coupling limit ($\\lambda\\to\\infty$, where $\\lambda$ is the\nstrength of the electron-electron interaction). In this work, we first compare\nthe theoretical prediction for the two leading terms in the strong coupling\nlimit with data obtained via numerical implementation of the exact Levy\nfunctional in the simple case of two electrons confined in one dimension,\nconfirming the asymptotic exactness of these two terms. We then carry out a\nfirst study on the incorporation of the fermionic statistics at large coupling\n$\\lambda$, both numerical and theoretical, confirming that spin effects enter\nat orders $\\sim e^{-\\sqrt{\\lambda}}$.\n", "  The main goal of this work is to clarify and quantify, by means of\nmathematical analysis, the role of structural viscoelasticity in the\nbiomechanical response of deformable porous media with incompressible\nconstituents to sudden changes in external applied loads. Models of deformable\nporous media with incompressible constituents are often utilized to describe\nthe behavior of biological tissues, such as cartilages, bones and engineered\ntissue scaffolds, where viscoelastic properties may change with age, disease or\nby design. Here, for the first time, we show that the fluid velocity within the\nmedium could increase tremendously, even up to infinity, should the external\napplied load experience sudden changes in time and the structural\nviscoelasticity be too small. In particular, we consider a one-dimensional\nporo-visco-elastic model for which we derive explicit solutions in the cases\nwhere the external applied load is characterized by a step pulse or a\ntrapezoidal pulse in time. By means of dimensional analysis, we identify some\ndimensionless parameters that can aid the design of structural properties\nand/or experimental conditions as to ensure that the fluid velocity within the\nmedium remains bounded below a certain given threshold, thereby preventing\npotential tissue damage. The application to confined compression tests for\nbiological tissues is discussed in detail. Interestingly, the loss of\nviscoelastic tissue properties has been associated with various disease\nconditions, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma. Thus,\nthe findings of this work may be relevant to many applications in biology and\nmedicine.\n", "  We consider a phenomenologycal parametrization of the QCD running coupling\nwhich arises from the dispersion relation respecting the holomorphic properties\nof the physical QCD observables in the complex momentum plane. The parameters\nare fixed by the following requirements: 1) at enough high energies, it\nreproduces the underlying perturbative coupling, 2) at intermediate energy\nmomenta, it reproduces the experimental semihadronic tau decay ratio, and 3) in\nthe deep IR regime, it satisfies the qualitative properties coming from recent\nlattice results. Finally, we apply this new coupling to low-energy available\nexperimental data. In particular, to Borel sum rules for {\\tau}-decay,\nextracting the values of the dimension 4 and 6 condensates, to the V-channel\nAdler function, and to polarized Bjorken Sum Rule.\n", "  The stimulating connection between the reversal of near field plasmonic\nbinding force and the role of symmetry breaking has not been investigated in\ndetail in literature. As both bonding and anti-bonding modes are present in the\nvisible spectra of well-known spherical plasmonic heterodimer sets, binding\nforce reversal is commonly believed to occur for all such heterodimers. But our\nwork suggests a very different proposal. We demonstrate that for the symmetry\nbroken heterodimer configurations: reversal of lateral (for on-axis\nheterodimers) and longitudinal (for off-axis heterodimers: end-fire and nearly\nend-fire configurations) near field binding force follow fully distinct\nmechanisms; i.e. later one on relative orientation and constructive\ndipole-quadrupole resonance but the former one on light polarization and the\ninduced electric resonance. Interestingly, the reversal of longitudinal near\nfield binding force can be easily controlled just by changing the direction of\nlight propagation or just their relative orientation. Though it is commonly\nbelieved that plasmonic forces mostly arise from the surface force and Fano\nresonance can be a promising way to achieve binding force reversal; our study\nbased on Lorentz force dynamics suggests notably opposite proposals (for both\ninstances) for the case of plasmonic spherical heterodimers. Observations of\nthis article can be very useful for improved sensors, particle clustering and\naggregation.\n", "  The Standard Model is by far the most encompassing physics theory. With the\nrecent discovery of the Higgs Boson, the Standard Model has performed extremely\nwell against experimental data. However, the theory is intrinsically not\ncomplete, it does not address physical phenomenon such as gravity and dark\nmatter. Many proposals for physics beyond the Standard Model predict new\nmassive bosons from additional gauge fields or extended Higgs sectors. This\npaper examines a preliminary search of possible V gamma decay channels of\nproposed new bosons.\n", "  A binary neutron star (BNS) merger has been widely argued to be one of the\nprogenitors of a short gamma-ray burst (SGRB). This central engine can be\nverified if its gravitational-wave (GW) event is detected simultaneously. Once\nconfirmed, this kind of association will be a landmark in multi-messenger\nastronomy and will greatly enhance our understanding of the BNS merger\nprocesses. Due to the limited detection horizon of BNS mergers for the advanced\nLIGO/Virgo GW observatories, we are inclined to local SGRBs within few hundreds\nof mega-parsecs. Since normal SGRBs rarely fall into such a close range, to\nmake it more observationally valuable, we have to focus on low-luminosity SGRBs\nwhich have a higher statistical occurrence rate and detection probability.\nHowever, there is a possibility that an observed low-luminosity SGRB is\nintrinsically powerful but we are off-axis and only observe its side emission.\nIn this paper, we provide some theoretical predictions of both the off-axis\nafterglow emission from a nearby SGRB under the assumption of a structured jet\nand the macronova signal from the ejecta of this GW-detectable BNS merger. From\nthe properties of the afterglow emission, we could distinguish an off-axis\nnormal SGRB from an intrinsically low-energy quasi-isotropic class.\nFurthermore, with follow-up multi-wavelength observations, a few parameters for\nBNS mergers (e.g. the medium density and the ejecta mass and velocity) would be\nconstrained.\n", "  The viscosity-radius relationship for semi-dilute polymer solutions is\nderived using scaling arguments. The viscosity temperature and the temperature\nradius relationships are combined using the transitive equality relationship.\nThe viscosity-radius relationship is determined to be . The reduced viscosity\nobserved with both increasing temperature and increasing shear rate then\nresults from a reduction in coil radius.\n", "  We analyzed high angular resolution observations of the Very Large Array\narchive at a wavelength of 7 mm of the L1551 IRS 5 binary system. Six sets of\nobservations,five with the A configuration and one with the B configuration,\nwere used, covering a time span of about 15 years. With these multi-epoch data,\nwe estimated the absolute and relative proper motions of the binary system,\nwhich are about 25.1 mas/yr (~ 16.7 km/s considering a distance of 140 pc) and\n4.2 mas/yr, respectively. Finally, based on the relative proper motion, we\nestimated a total mass of the L1551 IRS 5 binary system of 1.7 Msun and an\norbital period of 246 years.\n", "  Standard three-flavor neutrino oscillations have well explained by a wide\nrange of neutrino experiments. However, the anomalous results, such as\nelectron-antineutrino excess seen by LSND and MiniBooNE do not fit the\nthree-flavor paradigm. This can be explained by an additional fourth flavor\nsterile neutrino at a larger scale than the existing three flavor neutrinos.\nThe NOvA experiment consists of two finely segmented, liquid scintillator\ndetectors operating 14 .6 mrad off-axis from the NuMI muon-neutrino beam. The\nNear Detector is located on the Fermilab campus, 1 km from the NuMI target,\nwhile the Far Detector is located at Ash River, MN, 810 km from the NuMI\ntarget. The NOvA experiment is primarily designed to measure electron-neutrino\nappearance at the Far Detector using the Near Detector to control systematic\nuncertainties; however, the Near Detector is well suited for searching for\nanomalous short-baseline oscillations. This poster will present a novel method\nfor selecting tau neutrino interactions with high purity at the Near Detector\nusing a convolutional neural network. Using this method, the sensitivity to\nanomalous short-baseline tau-neutrino appearance due to sterile neutrino\noscillations will be presented.\n", "  The high-order harmonic generation (HHG), if phase matched, opens a unique\nway to produce coherent ultrafast extreme-UV (XUV) or soft x-ray light sources.\nHere we describe a robust and tunable method for scaling and narrowing the\nbandwidth of high-order harmonics in different transversal modes based on\nfemtosecond dynamic grating in a gas jet. This technique has potential of\nself-phase controlled XUV generation by adjusting the intersect angle and the\nintensity ratio of interfering fundamental beams. The limitations of using high\nintensity laser fundamental pulses in gas, such as non-negligible the magnetic\nfield which prevents recombination with parent and self-focusing of laser and\nplasma creation in the generated harmonics beam path which prevents phase\nmatching, can be solved by using dynamic grating generated by the fundamental\npulse and/or its harmonic with small intersect angle. The grating pattern\nintroduces a phase modulation in the dipole emission imprint such pattern in\nthe gas medium. As the spatial and temporal behaviors of the grating are\nclosely connected in harmonic generation, by shaping of the spatial profile of\nthe interfering beams it is possible to create a more complex tunable beating\npattern as harmonic sources to transfer desired optical information to XUV\npulses. In this case, the phase mismatch can be completely compensate by tuning\nthe gas pressure, adjusting the intersect angle as well as intensity ratio of\nthe interfering beams to produce a bright XUV with desired transversal mode.\n", "  We extend the theory of ground states of classical Heisenberg spin systems\npreviously published to the case where the interaction with an external\nmagnetic field is described by a Zeeman term. The ground state problem for the\nHeisenberg-Zeeman Hamiltonian can be reduced first to the relative ground state\nproblem, and, in a second step, to the absolute ground state problem for pure\nHeisenberg Hamiltonians depending on an additional Lagrange parameter. We\ndistinguish between continuous and discontinuous reduction. Moreover, there are\nvarious general statements about Heisenberg-Zeeman systems that will be proven\nunder most general assumptions. One topic is the connection between the minimal\nenergy functions $E_{min}$ for the Heisenberg energy and $H_{min}$ for the\nHeisenberg-Zeeman energy which turn out to be essentially mutual\nLegendre-Fenchel transforms. This generalization of the traditional Legendre\ntransform is especially suited to cope with situations where the function\n$E_{min}$ is not convex and consequently there is a magnetization jump at a\ncritical field. Another topic is magnetization and the occurrence of threshold\nfields $B_{thr}$ and saturation fields $B_{sat}$, where we provide a general\nformula for the latter. We suggest a distinction between ferromagnetic and\nanti-ferromagnetic systems based on the vanishing of $B_{sat}$ for the former\nones. Parabolic systems are defined in such a way that $E_{min}$ and $H_{min}$\nhave a particularly simple form and studied in detail. For a large class of\nparabolic systems the relative ground states can be constructed from the\nabsolute ground state by means of a so-called umbrella family. Finally we\nprovide a counter-example of a parabolic system where this construction is not\npossible.\n", "  We study the spatio-temporal evolution of the nonlinear electrostatic\noscillations in a cold magnetized electron-positron (e-p) plasma using both\nanalytics and simulations. Using a perturbative method we demonstrate that the\nnonlinear solutions change significantly when a pure electrostatic mode is\nexcited at the linear level instead of a mixed upper-hybrid and zero-frequency\nmode that is considered in a recent study. The pure electrostatic oscillations\nundergo phase mixing nonlinearly. However, the presence of the magnetic field\nsignificantly delays the phase-mixing compared to that observed in the\ncorresponding unmagnetized plasma. Using 1D PIC simulations we then analyze the\ndamping of the primary modes of the pure oscillations in detail and infer the\ndependence of the phase-mixing time on the magnetic field and the amplitude of\nthe oscillations. The results are remarkably different from those found for the\nmixed upper-hybrid mode mentioned above. Exploiting the symmetry of the e-p\nplasma we then explain a generalized symmetry of our non-linear solutions. The\nsymmetry allows us to construct a unique nonlinear solution up to the second\norder which does not show any signature of phase mixing but results in a\nnonlinear wave traveling at upper-hybrid frequency. Our investigations have\nrelevance for laboratory/astrophysical e-p plasmas.\n", "  Within the PHFB approach, the $0^{+}\\rightarrow 2^{+}$ transition of two\nneutrino double-$\\beta $ decay of $^{94,96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{104}$Ru,\n$^{110}$Pd, $^{128,130}$Te and $^{150}$Nd isotopes is studied employing wave\nfunctions generated with four different parametrizations of the pairing plus\nmultipole type of two-nucleon interaction and the summation method. In\ncomparison to the $0^{+}\\rightarrow 0^{+}$ transition, the nuclear transition\nmatrix elements $M_{2\\nu }(2^{+})$ are quite sensitive to the deformation of\nthe yrast 2$^{+}$ state. Consideration of the available theoretical and\nexperimental results suggest that the observation of the 0$% ^{+}\\rightarrow\n$2$^{+}$ transition of $2\\nu \\beta ^{-}\\beta ^{-}$ decay may be possible in\n$^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{130}$Te and $^{150}$Nd isotopes. The effect of\ndeformation on the $M_{2\\nu }(2^{+})$ is also studied.\n", "  A Weyl semimetal is a new type of topological quantum phase with intriguing\nphysics near the Weyl nodes. Although the equilibrium state of Weyl semimetals\nhas been investigated, the ultrafast dynamics near the Weyl node in the\nnonequilibrium state is still missing. Here by performing time and angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy on type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe$_2$, we\nreveal the dispersion of the unoccupied states and identify the Weyl node at 70\nmeV above E$_F$. Moreover, by tracking the ultrafast relaxation dynamics near\nthe Weyl node upon photo-excitation with energy, momentum and temporal\nresolution, two intrinsic recovery timescales are observed, a fast one of 430\nfs and a slow one of 4.1 ps, which are associated with hot electron cooling by\noptical phonon cascade emission and anharmonic decay of hot optical phonons\nrespectively. The electron population shows a metallic response, and the two\ntemperature model fitting of the transient electronic temperature gives an\nelectron-phonon coupling constant of $\\lambda\\langle\\Omega^2\\rangle\\simeq32$\n$\\textrm{meV}^2$. Our work provides important dynamic information for\nunderstanding the relaxation mechanism of a Weyl semimetal and for exploiting\npotential applications using ultrafast optical control.\n", "  Fullerenes have attracted interest for their possible applications in various\nelectronic, biological, and optoelectronic devices. However, for efficient use\nin such devices, a suitable anchoring group has to be employed that forms\nwell-defined and stable contacts with the electrodes. In this work, we propose\na novel fullerene tetramalonate derivate functionalized with trans-1\n4,5-diazafluorene anchoring groups. The conductance of single-molecule\njunctions, investigated in two different setups with the mechanically\ncontrolled break junction technique, reveals the formation of molecular\njunctions at three conductance levels. We attribute the conductance peaks to\nthree binding modes of the anchoring groups to the gold electrodes. Density\nfunctional theory calculations confirm the existence of multiple binding\nconfigurations and calculated transmission functions are consistent with\nexperimentally determined conductance values.\n", "  Argon Gas Cluster-Ion Beam sources have become widely-used on x-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)\ninstruments in recent years, but there is little reference data on sputter\nyields in the literature as yet. Total sputter yield reference data is needed\nin order to plan, and later calibrate the depth scale, of XPS or SIMS depth\nprofiles. We previously published a semi-empirical Threshold equation for\nestimating cluster total sputter yield from the energy-per-atom of the cluster\nand the effective monatomic sputter threshold of the material. This has already\nbeen shown to agree extremely well with sputter yield measurements on a range\nof organic and inorganic materials for clusters of around a thousand atoms.\nHere we use the molecular dynamics (MD) approach to explore a wider range of\nenergy and cluster size than is easy to do experimentally to high precision. We\nhave performed MD simulations using the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively\nParallel Simulator (LAMMPS) parallel MD code on high-performance computer (HPC)\nsystems at Cincinnati and Newcastle. We performed 1,150 simulations of\nindividual collisions with a silicon (100) surface as an archetypal inorganic\nsubstrate, for cluster sizes between 30 and 3,000 argon atoms and energies in\nthe range 5 to 40eV per atom. This corresponds to the most important regime for\nexperimental cluster depth-profiling in SIMS and XPS. Our MD results show a\ndependence on cluster size as well as energy-per-atom. Using the exponent\npreviously suggested by Paruch et al, we modified the Threshold model equation\npublished previously to take this into account. The modified Threshold equation\nfits all our MD results extremely well, building on its success in fitting\nexperimental sputter yield measurements.\n", "  In the Standard Model, the three charged lepton are identical copies of each\nother, apart from mass differences. Experimental tests of this feature in\ndecays of semileptonic b hadrons, such as $B\\rightarrow D^* \\tau\\ nu$, are\nhighly sensitive to New Physics particles which preferentially couple to the\n3rd generation.A measurement of $R(D^{*-})$ using 3-prong $\\tau$ decays\nperformed by LHCb is reported.\n", "  We consider structure and emission properties of a pair plasma fireball that\ncools due to radiation. At temperatures $T \\geq 0.5 m_e c^2$ the cooling takes\na form of clearly defined cooling wave, whereby the temperature and pair\ndensity experience a sharp drop within a narrow region. The surface\ntemperature, corresponding to the location where the optical depth to infinity\nreaches unity, never falls much below $0.1 m_e c^2 \\approx 50$ keV. The\npropagation velocity of the cooling wave is much smaller than the speed of\nlight and decreases with increasing bulk temperature.\n", "  Given the Laplacian on a planar, convex domain with piecewise linear boundary\nsubject to mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions, we provide a sufficient\ncondition for its lowest eigenvalue to dominate the lowest eigenvalue of the\nLaplacian with the complementary boundary conditions (i.e. with Dirichlet\nreplaced by Neumann and vice versa). The application of this result to\ntriangles gives an affirmative partial answer to a recent conjecture. Moreover,\nwe prove a further observation of similar flavor for right triangles.\n", "  It is now well established that, due to excitation of localized surface\nplasmon resonances in plasmonic nanosystems, the electric field from an\nexternal irradiation source is greatly amplified in their vicinity. Surface\nplasmon mediated electric field amplification near plasmonic nanosystems is of\nvital importance for; light absorption enhancement of solar cells, molecular\ndetection using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, proximity measurement of\nbiological macromolecules such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids using\nplasmon enhanced FRET, cancer therapy using photothermal effects, just to name\nonly a few applications. Present work formulates Bergman-Milton multipole\nspectral expansion approach for investigating surface plasmon mediated electric\nfield amplification in the dimer arrangement of Al, Ag and Au nanoparticles. In\ncomparison to an isolated spherical shaped nanoparticle, their aggregate\nprovide greater field enhancement, wider spectral tuning, and multiple resonant\nfeatures. In view of the superior plasmonic characteristics of dimer\nconfiguration, a systematic investigation of electric field enhancement is done\nand their suitability for UV-Visible applications is assessed. The role of\nparticle size, embedding medium and interparticle separation in field\namplification and wavelength tuning is quantified. Moreover, plasmonic\nnanoparticle dimer designs for UV-Visible spectral window are presented.\n", "  Extraordinary transmission through subwavelength metallic apertures has been\nextensively studied and demonstrated. At resonance, the coupling between\nsurface plasmons on both surfaces of the metallic film tunnels the photon from\nthe one side to the other through the subwavelength aperture with small\ntransmission efficiency based on the metals dielectric parameters and aperture\ngeometrical dimensions. Here, we report a completely different form of\nextraordinary transmission, where the two subwavelength complementary apertures\nwhen coupled with an optical cavity induce about 100% extraordinary\ntransmission far away from the natural plasmon resonance of the constituent\nmetallic apertures. Such unique cavity phase driven plasmon resonance enables\ntuning of the extraordinary transmission band across wide spectral range unlike\npreviously reported geometry driven extraordinary transmission.\n", "  The MicroBooNE experiment at Fermilab uses liquid argon time projection\nchamber (LArTPC) technology to study neutrino interactions in argon. A\nfundamental requirement for LArTPCs is to achieve and maintain a low level of\nelectronegative contaminants in the liquid to minimize the capture of drifting\nionization electrons. The attenuation time for the drifting electrons should be\nlong compared to the maximum drift time, so that the signals from particle\ntracks that generate ionization electrons with long drift paths can be detected\nefficiently. In this talk we present MicroBooNE measurement of electron\nattenuation using cosmic ray muons. The result yields a minimum electron 1/e\nlifetime of 18 ms under typical operating conditions, which is long compared to\nthe maximum drift time of 2.3 ms.\n", "  We analyze the structure diagram for binary clusters of Lennard-Jones\nparticles by means of a global optimization approach for a large range of\ncluster sizes, compositions and interaction energies and present a publicly\naccessible database of 180,000 minimal energy structures\n(http://softmattertheory.lu/clusters.html). We identify a variety of structures\nsuch as core-shell clusters, Janus clusters and clusters in which the minority\nspecies is located at the vertices of icosahedra. Such clusters can be\nsynthesized from nanoparticles in agglomeration experiments and used as\nbuilding blocks in colloidal molecules or crystals. We discuss the factors that\ndetermine the formation of clusters with specific structures.\n", "  We obtain general results on the dynamics of exactly conical geometries,\nwhere we use the notion of boundaries at infinity to characterize asymptotic\nbehavior. As we demonstrate in examples, these notions also apply to smooth\ngeometries that are merely asymptotically conical, such as the Eguchi-Hanson or\nresolved conifold geometries. In these cases we obtain a rather complete\nqualitative understanding of the varieties of asymptotic behavior, and we probe\nthe connectivity of the phase space by finding infinitely large families of\nmultiple geodesics connecting a point on the infinite past boundary with a\npoint in the infinite future boundary.\n", "  The first results of a new application of the Thomas-Fermi statistical quark\nmodel to mesonic matter is presented. Interesting aspects of the theory are\ndiscussed, distinguishing such states from baryonic matter. A major motivation\nof this study is the tetraquark states discovered by the Belle and other\ncollaborations and the possibility that stable multi-quark families of such\nstates exist. Similar to our previous baryonic study, we use a two-inequivalent\nwave function approach to investigate aspects of multi-quark matter. We think\nof our model as a tool for quickly assessing the characteristics of new,\npossibly bound, particle states of higher quark number content, which can not\nyet be examined by lattice methods.\n", "  In this paper we present the development of a simulation code capable of\noptimizing the geometry of a spiral inflector designed for axial injection into\na cyclotron. To do this, an electric field map of the device is generated by\nutilizing a boundary elements method and then used to track one or more\nparticles. The information from the trajectories is then used to shorten the\nelectrodes of the spiral inflector to adjust for fringing electric fields such\nthat the particles end up on the mid-plane of the cyclotron. This method was\nalso used to analyze the effects of a modified electrode geometry that can\nfocus the beam as it travels through the device. Compared against commercial\nmultiphysics software, the developed code produced similar results within a\nnegligible margin of error attributed to differences in meshing and particle\ntracking algorithms.\n", "  Dimensionality reduction techniques have found great success in a wide range\nof fields requiring analysis of high-dimensional datasets. Time-lagged\nindependent components analysis (TICA), which finds independent components\n(TICs) with maximal autocorrelation, is often applied to atomistic biomolecular\nsimulations, where the full molecular configuration can be projected onto only\na few TICs describing the slowest modes of motion. Recently, Sultan and Pande\nhave proposed the use of TICs as collective variables for enhanced sampling.\nHowever, it is unclear what the best strategy for estimating the TICs of a\nsystem is a priori. In order to evaluate the utility of TICs calculated on one\nsystem to describe the slow dynamics of similar systems, we develop a\nmethodology for measuring the transferability of TICs and apply it to a wide\nrange of systems. We find that transferred TICs can approximate the slowest\ndynamics of some systems surprisingly well, while failing to transfer between\nother sets of systems, highlighting the inherent difficulties of predicting TIC\ntransferability. Additionally, we use two dimensional Brownian dynamics\nsimulations on similar potential surfaces to gain insight into the relationship\nbetween TIC transferability and potential surface changes.\n", "  The NOvA experiment is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment\ndesigned to measure electron neutrino appearance in a muon neutrino beam. It\nconsists of two finely segmented, liquid scintillator detectors at 14 mrad\noff-axis in the NuMI beam.The NOvA Near Detector, located at Fermilab, provides\nan excellent opportunity to study neutrino-nucleus interactions which are\nimportant for the neutrino oscillation measurements. This talk will present one\nof the first such measurements from the NOvA Near Detector: neutral current\ncoherent-$\\pi^0$ production. Neutrinos can coherently interact with the target\nnucleus via neutral current exchange and produce a single, forward $\\pi^0$,\nwhich is a background to the $\\nu_e$ appearance measurement. This analysis\nmeasures the coherent- $\\pi^0$ kinematics and cross-section and compares it to\nthe model predictions. A data-driven method is developed to constrain the\nneutral current resonance and deep-inelastic $\\pi^0$ productions which are\nbackground to this analysis.\n", "  The GAPS experiment is designed to carry out a sensitive dark matter search\nby measuring low-energy cosmic ray antideuterons and antiprotons. GAPS will\nprovide a new avenue to access a wide range of dark matter models and masses\nthat is complementary to direct detection techniques, collider experiments and\nother indirect detection techniques. Well-motivated theories beyond the\nStandard Model contain viable dark matter candidates which could lead to a\ndetectable signal of antideuterons resulting from the annihilation or decay of\ndark matter particles. The dark matter contribution to the antideuteron flux is\nbelieved to be especially large at low energies (E < 1 GeV), where the\npredicted flux from conventional astrophysical sources (i.e. from secondary\ninteractions of cosmic rays) is very low. The GAPS low-energy antiproton search\nwill provide stringent constraints on less than 10 GeV dark matter, will\nprovide the best limits on primordial black hole evaporation on Galactic length\nscales, and will explore new discovery space in cosmic ray physics.\n  Unlike other antimatter search experiments such as BESS and AMS that use\nmagnetic spectrometers, GAPS detects antideuterons and antiprotons using an\nexotic atom technique. This technique, and its unique event topology, will give\nGAPS a nearly background-free detection capability that is critical in a\nrare-event search. GAPS is designed to carry out its science program using\nlong-duration balloon flights in Antarctica. A prototype instrument was\nsuccessfully flown from Taiki, Japan in 2012. GAPS has now been approved by\nNASA to proceed towards the full science instrument, with the possibility of a\nfirst long-duration balloon flight in late 2020. Here we motivate low-energy\ncosmic ray antimatter searches and discuss the current status of the GAPS\nexperiment and the design of the payload.\n", "  The KOTO experiment is a particle physics experiment located in J-PARC,\nJapan, aiming to explore physics beyond the Standard Model by measuring the\nbranching ratio of the $K_L\\rightarrow\\pi^{0}\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ decay. This decay\nhas not yet been observed. The branching ratio predicted by the Standard Model\nof $(3.0\\pm0.3)\\times10^{-11}$ and the current experimental upper limit\nestablished by KEK E391a is $2.6\\times10^{-8}$.\n  The signal of $K_L\\rightarrow\\pi^{0}\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ decay has the signature of\ntwo photons on the calorimeter with no signal on the veto detectors. It also\nhas a large transverse momentum due to missing neutrinos. Kaons that decay\noutside the beam line with final product of two photons, such as\n$K_L\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$ and $K_L\\rightarrow\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\pi^{0}$, can\nappear to have large transverse momentum due to kaon scattering and beam\ninteraction with the detectors. These off-axis kaon decay events can impact the\nupper limit of $K_L\\rightarrow\\pi^{0}\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ branching ratio. Aluminum\ntargets located at the upstream of the KOTO detector and inside the\ndecay-volume were used to study kaon beam profile, which provided off-axis kaon\ndecay vertex information. The beam profile provided insights on background\ncontributions to the signal. Studies on the kaon beam profile and background\nidentification from kaon scattering were presented in this talk.\n", "  MicroBooNE is a neutrino experiment based at Fermilab which consists of a\nliquid argon time-projection chamber in the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB). The\nexperiment aims to investigate the excess of electron-neutrino-like events seen\nby the MiniBooNE experiment, also located in the BNB, which is potential\nevidence for new non-Standard Model physics such as sterile neutrinos. I\ndiscuss the status of a search for low-energy electron-neutrino interactions\nwithin the MicroBooNE detector. This analysis features a hybrid approach of\ntraditional reconstruction methods along with the use of convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs), a type of deep learning algorithm highly adept at pattern\nrecognition. I describe the identification of events and the ways in which the\nCNNs are used. I also outline the ways that we are addressing issues related to\napplying CNNs, which are trained on simulated data, to data from the detector.\n", "  We provide a simple method for detecting of cycles in discrete autonomous\nvector dynamical systems. The method generalizes some results by O.Morgul.\n", "  In this work, we analyse and model a real life financial loan application\nbelonging to a sample bank in the Netherlands. The log is robust in terms of\ndata, containing a total of 262 200 event logs, belonging to 13 087 different\ncredit applications. The dataset is heterogeneous and consists of a mixture of\ncomputer generated automatic processes and manual human tasks. The goal is to\nwork out a decision model, which represents the underlying tasks that make up\nthe loan application service, and to assess potential areas of improvement of\nthe institution's internal processes. To this end we study the impact of\nincomplete event logs for the extraction and analysis of business processes. It\nis quite common that event logs are incomplete with several amounts of missing\ninformation (for instance, workers forget to register their tasks). Absence of\ndata is translated into a drastic decrease of precision and compromises the\ndecision models, leading to biased and unrepresentative results. We investigate\nhow classical probabilistic models are affected by incomplete event logs and we\nexplore quantum-like probabilistic inferences as an alternative mathematical\nmodel to classical probability. This work represents a first step towards\nsystematic investigation of the impact of quantum interference in a real life\nlarge scale decision scenario. The results obtained in this study indicate\nthat, under high levels of uncertainty, the quantum-like models generate\nquantum interference terms, which allow an additional non-linear\nparameterisation of the data. Experimental results attest the efficiency of the\nquantum-like Bayesian networks, since the application of interference terms is\nable to reduce the error percentage of inferences performed over quantum-like\nmodels when compared to inferences produced by classical models.\n", "  The work presents the extended theoretical model of the electrical\nconductance in non-magnetic and magnetic nano-size point contacts. The\ndeveloped approach describes diffusive, quasi-ballistic, ballistic and quantum\nregimes of the spin-resolved conductance. It is based on the electron transport\nthrough metallic junction within approach of the circular constriction. The\nmodel provides unified description of the contact resistance from Maxwell\ndiffusive through the ballistic to purely quantum transport regimes without any\nresidual terms depending from the scale. An application are given for\nexperimental treatment of the golden nanocontacts as a non-magnetic case and\nPermalloy nanowire with/without domain wall as example for the magnetic system.\nThe model of quantum point contact assumes that contact area can be replaced by\nthe quantum object (i.e. magnetic tunnel junction, narrow domain wall, etc.),\nwhere potential energy profile determine its electrical properties.\n", "  The EW-$\\nu_R$ model was constructed to provide a scenario in which\nright-handed neutrinos are non-sterile and have masses proportional to the\nelectroweak scale, providing an opportunity to test the seesaw mechanism at the\nLHC. What was hidden in the model until recently is the chiral symmetry which\nhelps solve the strong CP problem by using it to rotate $\\theta_{QCD}$ to zero.\nIt turns out the contribution from the electroweak sector to the effective\n$\\bar{\\theta}$ is proportional to the light neutrino masses and is naturally\nsmall, satisfying the constraint coming from the present absence of the neutron\nelectric dipole moment, and without the need for an axion.\n  Talk presented at the APS Division of Particles and Fields Meeting (DPF\n2017), July 31-August 4, 2017, Fermilab. C170731\n", "  Recent development in quantum photonics allowed to start the process of\nbringing photonic-quantum-based systems out of the lab into real world\napplications. As an example, devices for the exchange of a cryptographic key\nsecured by the law of quantum mechanics are currently commercially available.\nIn order to further boost this process, the next step is to migrate the results\nachieved by means of bulky and expensive setups to miniaturized and affordable\ndevices. Integrated quantum photonics is exactly addressing this issue. In this\npaper we briefly review the most recent advancements in the generation of\nquantum states of light (at the core of quantum cryptography and computing) on\nchip. In particular, we focus on optical microcavities, as they can offer a\nsolution to the issue of low efficiency (low number of photons generated)\ntypical of the materials mostly used in integrated platforms. In addition, we\nshow that specifically designed microcavities can also offer further\nadvantages, such as compatibility with existing telecom standard (thus allowing\nto exploit the existing fiber network) and quantum memories (necessary in turns\nto extend the communication distance), as well as longitudinal multimode\ncharacter. This last property (i.e. the increased dimensionality necessary for\ndescribing the quantum state of a photon) is achieved thanks to the generating\nmultiple photon pairs on a frequency comb corresponding to the microcavity\nresonances. Further achievements include the possibility to fully exploit the\npolarization degree of freedom also for integrated devices. These results pave\nthe way to the generation of integrated quantum frequency combs, that in turn\nmay find application as quantum computing platform.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the study of periodic solutions for a radially\nsymmetric semilinear wave equation in an $n$-dimensional ball. By combining the\nvariational methods and saddle point reduction technique, we prove there exist\nat least three periodic solutions for arbitrary space dimension $n$. The\nstructure of the spectrum of the linearized problem plays an essential role in\nthe proof, and the construction of a suitable working space is devised to\novercome the restriction of space dimension.\n", "  Recently, Grabowska and Kaplan constructed a four-dimensional lattice\nformulation of chiral gauge theories on the basis of the chiral overlap\noperator. At least in the tree-level approximation, the left-handed fermion is\ncoupled only to the original gauge field~$A$, while the right-handed one is\ncoupled only to the gauge field~$A_\\star$, a deformation of~$A$ by the gradient\nflow with infinite flow time. In this paper, we study the fermion one-loop\neffective action in their formulation. We show that the continuum limit of this\neffective action contains local interaction terms between $A$ and~$A_\\star$,\neven if the anomaly cancellation condition is met. These non-vanishing terms\nwould lead an undesired perturbative spectrum in the formulation.\n", "  We present detailed experiments on transient growth of turbulent spots\ninduced by external forcing in plane Couette-Poiseuille flow, which are studied\nin the framework of linear of transient growth. The experimental investigation\nis supplemented with full theoretical analysis. We compare quantitatively the\nexperimental and theoretical results, including maximal gain and the time at\nwhich it occurs. We also present the limits of validity for the application of\nthe linear theory at high amplitude perturbation and Reynolds number, showing\nexperiments with self-sustained states.\n", "  We report grazing incidence small angle neutron scattering (GISANS) and\ncomplementary off-specular neutron reflectometry (OSR) of the magnetic order in\na single-crystalline epitaxial MnSi film on Si(111) in the thick film limit.\nProviding a means of direct reciprocal space mapping, GISANS and OSR reveal a\nmagnetic modulation perpendicular to the films under magnetic fields parallel\nand perpendicular to the film, where additional polarized neutron reflectometry\n(PNR) and magnetization measurements are in excellent agreement with the\nliterature. Regardless of field orientation, our data does not suggest the\npresence of more complex spin textures, notably the formation of skyrmions.\nThis observation establishes a distinct difference with bulk samples of MnSi of\nsimilar thickness under perpendicular field, in which a skyrmion lattice\ndominates the phase diagram. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure\nmeasurements suggest that small shifts of the Si positions within the\nunstrained unit cell control the magnetic state, representing the main\ndifference between the films and thin bulk samples.\n", "  We study the unconventional transmission properties of a wave-packet through\na PT-symmetric potential region, as describing actual electromagnetic wave\npropagation along a waveguide filled with gain and loss media. The non-trivial\nbehavior of the transmission probability manifests in the giant amplification\nof the incident electromagnetic signal of given wavelengths for well-defined\nconfigurations, depending on the gain/loss contrast. Maximum transmission peaks\nare related to spectral singularities and a strict correlation exists between\nthe \"resonant\" wavelengths and the gain/loss contrast. The transit times are as\nwell calculated, showing their surprising vanishing in the opaque barrier\nlimit, independently of the gain/loss contrast, which is reminiscent of some\nsort of Hartman effect. Also, non-local effects manifest in the presence of\nnegative delay times for given configurations, while a correlation is apparent\nbetween maximum delay times and transmission probability peaks, though\nappreciably depending on the gain/loss contrast.\n", "  This paper concerns the study of direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of a\nwavepacket in laminar turbulent transition in a Blasius boundary layer. The\ndecomposition of this wavepacket into a set of \"modes\" (a basis that spans an\napproximate solution space) can be achieved in a wide variety of ways. Two\nwell-known tools are the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (POD). To synergize the strengths of both methods, a hybrid\nPOD-FFT is pioneered, using the FFT as a tool for interpreting the POD modes.\nThe POD-FFT automatically identifies well-known fundamental, subharmonic and\nKlebanoff modes in the flow, even though it is blind to the underlying physics.\nMoreover, the POD-FFT further separates the subharmonic content of the\nwavepacket into three fairly distinct parts: a positively detuned mode\nresembling a Lambda-vortex, a Craik-type tuned mode and a Herbert-type\npositive-negative detuned mode pair, in decreasing order of energy. This\ndistinction is less widely recognized, but it provides a possible explanation\nfor the slightly positively detuned subharmonic mode often observed in previous\nexperiments and simulations.\n", "  We report on a systematic study of Hall effect using high quality single\ncrystals of type-II Weyl semimetal WTe2 with the applied magnetic field B//c.\nThe residual resistivity ratio of 1330 and the large magnetoresistance of\n1.5\\times10^6 % in 9 T at 2 K, being in the highest class in the literature,\nattest to their high quality. Based on a simple two-band model, the densities\n(n_e and n_h) and mobilities (\\mu_e and \\mu_h) for electron and hole carriers\nhave been uniquely determined combining both Hall- and electrical-resistivity\ndata. The difference between ne and nh is ~1% at 2 K, indicating that the\nsystem is in an almost compensated condition. The negative Hall resistivity\ngrowing rapidly below ~20 K is due to a rapidly increasing \\mu_h/\\mu_e\napproaching one. Below 3 K in a low field region, we found the Hall resistivity\nbecomes positive, reflecting that \\mu_h/\\mu_e finally exceeds one in this\nregion. These anomalous behaviors of the carrier densities and mobilities might\nbe associated with the existence of a Lifshitz transition and/or the spin\ntexture on the Fermi surface.\n", "  A persistent signal of power asymmetry on opposite hemispheres of CMB sky was\nseen in full-sky temperature measurements made so far. This asymmetry was seen\nin microwave sky from WMAP as well as PLANCK satellites, and calls for\nattention the larger question of \\emph{statistical isotropy}, one of the\nfoundational principles of modern cosmology. In this work we present an\nanalysis of polarized CMB maps from PLANCK 2015 full mission data. We apply the\nlocal variance estimator on low resolution $E-$mode maps from PLANCK 2015\npolarization \\texttt{Commander} solution. We find a significant hemispherical\npower asymmetry in polarization data on large angular scales, at the level of\n$\\sim 2.6-3.9\\%$ depending on the galactic mask, and the circular disc radius\nused for computing local variance maps. However the direction is found to be\npointing broadly towards CMB kinetic dipole direction. Precise measurements of\nCMB polarization in future will shed light on this apparent discrepancy in the\nanisotropy axis seen in temperature and polarized CMB sky, and likely influence\nof systematics on our findings.\n", "  Tunable beam splitter (TBS) is a fundamental component which has been widely\nused in optical experiments. We realize a polarization-independent\norbital-angular-momentum-preserving TBS based on the combination of modified\npolarization beam splitters and half-wave plates. Greater than 30 dB of the\nextinction ratio of tunableness, lower than $6\\%$ of polarization dependence\nand more than 20 dB of the extinction ratio of OAM preservation show the\nrelatively good performance of the TBS. In addition, the TBS can save about 3/4\nof the optical elements compared with the existing scheme to implement the same\nfunction\\cite{yang2016experimental}, which makes it have great advantages in\nscalable applications. Using this TBS, we experimentally built a Sagnac\ninterferometer with the mean visibility of more than $99\\%$, which demonstrates\nits potential applications in quantum information process, such as quantum\ncryptography.\n", "  Quantum scars are enhancements of quantum probability density along classical\nperiodic orbits. We study the recently discovered phenomenon of strong,\nperturbation-induced quantum scarring in the two-dimensional harmonic\noscillator exposed to a homogeneous magnetic field. We demonstrate that both\nthe geometry and the orientation of the scars are fully controllable with a\nmagnetic field and a focused perturbative potential, respectively. These\nproperties may open a path into an experimental scheme to manipulate electric\ncurrents in nanostructures fabricated in a two-dimensional electron gas.\n", "  We present a novel methodology for the operation of macroscopic Kelvin Probe\ninstruments. The methodology is based on the use of a harmonic backing\npotential signal to drive the tip-sample variable capacitance and on a Fourier\nrepresentation of the tip current, allows for the operation of the instrument\nunder full control and improves its scanning performance by a factor of 60 or\nmore over that of currently available commercial instruments.\n", "  Dust drifting inward in protoplanetary disks is subject to increasing\ntemperatures. In laboratory experiments, we tempered basaltic dust between 873\nK and 1273 K and find that the dust grains change in size and composition.\nThese modifications influence the outcome of self-consistent low speed\naggregation experiments showing a transition temperature of 1000\\,K. Dust\ntempered at lower temperatures grows to a maximum aggregate size of $2.02 \\pm\n0.06$ mm, which is $1.49 \\pm 0.08$ times the value for dust tempered at higher\ntemperatures. A similar size ratio of $1.75 \\pm 0.16$ results for a different\nset of collision velocities. This transition temperature is in agreement with\norbit temperatures deduced for observed extrasolar planets. Most terrestrial\nplanets are observed at positions equivalent to less than 1000 K. Dust\naggregation on the millimeter-scale at elevated temperatures might therefore be\na key factor for terrestrial planet formation.\n", "  Time Projection Chamber (TPC) has been chosen as the main tracking system in\nseveral high-flux and high repetition rate experiments. These include on-going\nexperiments such as ALICE and future experiments such as PANDA at FAIR and ILC.\nDifferent $\\mathrm{R}\\&\\mathrm{D}$ activities were carried out on the adoption\nof Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) as the gas amplification stage of the\nALICE-TPC upgrade version. The requirement of low ion feedback has been\nestablished through these activities. Low ion feedback minimizes distortions\ndue to space charge and maintains the necessary values of detector gain and\nenergy resolution. In the present work, Garfield simulation framework has been\nused to study the related physical processes occurring within single, triple\nand quadruple GEM detectors. Ion backflow and electron transmission of\nquadruple GEMs, made up of foils with different hole pitch under different\nelectromagnetic field configurations (the projected solutions for the ALICE\nTPC) have been studied. Finally a new triple GEM detector configuration with\nlow ion backflow fraction and good electron transmission properties has been\nproposed as a simpler GEM-based alternative suitable for TPCs for future\ncollider experiments.\n", "  The primary impediment to continued improvement of charge-based electronics\nis the excessive energy dissipation incurred in switching a bit of information.\nWith suitable choice of materials, devices made of multiferroic composites,\ni.e., strain-coupled piezoelectric-magnetostrictive heterostructures, dissipate\nminiscule amount of energy of ~1 attojoule at room-temperature, while switching\nin sub-nanosecond delay. Apart from devising memory bits, such devices can be\nalso utilized for building logic, so that they can be deemed suitable for\ncomputing purposes as well. Here, we first review the current state of the art\nfor building nanoelectronics using multiferroic composites. On a recent\ndevelopment, it is shown that these multiferroic straintronic devices can be\nalso utilized for analog signal processing, with suitable choice of materials.\nBy solving stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of magnetization\ndynamics at room-temperature, it is shown that we can achieve a voltage gain,\ni.e., these straintronic devices can act as voltage amplifiers.\n", "  This article examines the consequences of the existence of an upper particle\nmomentum limit in quantum electrodynamics, where this momentum limit is the\nPlanck momentum. The method used is Fourier analysis as developed already by\nFermi in his fundamental work on the quantum theory of radiation. After\ndetermination of the appropriate Hamiltonian, a Schr\\\"odinger equation and the\nassociated commutation rules of the field operators are given. At the upper\nmomentum limit mentioned above, the divergent terms occurring in the\nHamiltonian (the self-energies of the electrons and the zero-point energy of\nthe electromagnetic field) adopt finite values, which will be stated and\ncompared with each other.\n", "  Ion backflow is one of the effects limiting the operation of a gaseous\ndetector at high flux, by giving rise to space charge which perturbs the\nelectric field. The natural ability of bulk Micromegas to suppress ion feedback\nis very effective and can help the TPC drift volume to remain relatively free\nof space charge build-up. An efficient and precise measurement of the backflow\nfraction is necessary to cope up with the track distortion due to the space\ncharge effect. In a subtle but significant modification of the usual approach,\nwe have made use of two drift meshes in order to measure the ion backflow\nfraction for bulk Micromegas detector. This helps to truly represent the\nbackflow fraction for a TPC. Moreover, attempt is taken to optimize the field\nconfiguration between the drift meshes. In conjunction with the experimental\nmeasurement, Garfield simulation framework has been used to simulate the\nrelated physics processes numerically.\n", "  A one-dimensional system of bosons interacting with contact and\nsingle-Gaussian forces is studied with an expansion in hyperspherical\nharmonics. The hyperradial potentials are calculated using the link between the\nhyperspherical harmonics and the single-particle harmonic-oscillator basis\nwhile the coupled hyperradial equations are solved with the Lagrange-mesh\nmethod. Extensions of this method are proposed to achieve good convergence with\nsmall numbers of mesh points for any truncation of hypermomentum. The\nconvergence with hypermomentum strongly depends on the range of the two-body\nforces: it is very good for large ranges but deteriorates as the range\ndecreases, being the worst for the contact interaction. In all cases, the\nlowest-order energy is within 4.5$\\%$ of the exact solution and shows the\ncorrect cubic asymptotic behaviour at large boson numbers. Details of the\nconvergence studies are presented for 3, 5, 20 and 100 bosons. A special\ntreatment for three bosons was found to be necessary. For single-Gaussian\ninteractions, the convergence rate improves with increasing boson number,\nsimilar to what happens in the case of three-dimensional systems of bosons.\n", "  Optomechanical systems based on nanophotonics are advancing the field of\nprecision motion measurement, quantum control and nanomechanical sensing. In\nthis context III-V semiconductors offer original assets like the\nheteroepitaxial growth of optimized metamaterials for photon/phonon\ninteractions. GaAs has already demonstrated high performances in optomechanics\nbut suffers from two photon absorption (TPA) at the telecom wavelength, which\ncan limit the cooperativity. Here, we investigate TPA-free III-V semiconductor\nmaterials for optomechanics applications: GaAs lattice-matched In0:5Ga0:5P and\nAl0:4Ga0:6As. We report on the fabrication and optical characterization of high\nfrequency (500-700 MHz) optomechanical disks made out of these two materials,\ndemonstrating high optical and mechanical Q in ambient conditions. Finally we\nachieve operating these new devices as laser-sustained optomechanical\nself-oscillators, and draw a first comparative study with existing GaAs\nsystems.\n", "  Exergy is a thermodynamic quantity useful to obtain information on the work\nfrom any process. The analyses of irreversibility are important in the\ndesigning and development of the productive processes for the economic growth,\nbut they play a fundamental role also in the analysis of socio-economic\ncontext. The link between the wasted exergy and the energy cost for maintain\nthe productive processes are obtained in the bioengineering thermodynamics.\nThis link holds to the fundamental role of fluxes and to the exergy exchanged\nin the interaction between the system and its environment. The equivalent\nwasted primary resource value is suggested as an indicator to support the\neconomic considerations on the biofuel production by using biomass and\nbacteria. Moreover, the technological considerations can be developed by using\nthe exergy inefficiency. Consequently, bacteria use can be compared with other\nway to obtain biofuels, by comparing both the technologies and the economic\nconsiderations.\n", "  Modulating the polarization of a beam of quantum particles is a powerful\nmethod to tailor the macroscopic properties of the ensuing energy flux as it\ndirectly influences the way in which its quantum constituents interact with\nother particles, waves or continuum media. Practical polarizers, being well\ndeveloped for electric and electromagnetic energy, have not been proposed to\ndate for heat fluxes carried by phonons. Here we report on atomistic phonon\ntransport calculations demonstrating that ferroelectric domain walls can\noperate as phonon polarizers when a heat flux pierces them. Our simulations for\nrepresentative ferroelectric perovskite PbTiO$_3$ show that the structural\ninhomogeneity associated to the domain walls strongly suppresses transverse\nphonons, while longitudinally polarized modes can travel through multiple walls\nin series largely ignoring their presence.\n", "  Wireless transfer of information is the basis of modern communication. It\nincludes cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth and GPS systems, all of which use\nelectromagnetic radio waves with frequencies ranging from typically 100 MHz to\na few GHz. However, several long-standing challenges with standard radio-wave\nwireless transmission still exist, including keeping secure transmission of\ndata from potential compromise. Here, we demonstrate wireless information\ntransfer using a line-of-sight optical architecture with a micromechanical\nelement. In this fundamentally new approach, a laser beam encoded with\ninformation impinges on a nonlinear micromechanical resonator located a\ndistance from the laser. The force generated by the radiation pressure of the\nlaser light on the nonlinear micromechanical resonator produces a sideband\nmodulation signal, which carries the precise information encoded in the subtle\nchanges in the radiation pressure. Using this, we demonstrate data and image\ntransfer with one hundred percent fidelity with a single 96 micron by 270\nmicron silicon resonator element in an optical frequency band. This mechanical\napproach relies only on the momentum of the incident photons and is therefore\nable to use any portion of the optical frequency banda band that is 10,000\ntimes wider than the radio frequency band. Our line-of-sight architecture using\nhighly scalable micromechanical resonators offers new possibilities in wireless\ncommunication. Due to their small size, these resonators can be easily arrayed\nwhile maintaining a small form factor to provide redundancy and parallelism.\n", "  We report the successful detection of an audio signal via sideband modulation\nof a nonlinear piezoelectric micromechanical resonator. The\n270$\\times$96-$\\mu$m resonator was shown to be reliable in audio detection for\nsound intensity levels as low as ambient room noise and to have an unamplified\nsensitivity of 23.9 $\\mu$V/Pa. Such an approach may be adapted in acoustic\nsensors and microphones for consumer electronics or medical equipment such as\nhearing aids.\n", "  We discuss the physics of the pot-in-pot cooler. By balancing temperature\ndecrease due to evaporation and temperature increase due to heat exchange, we\nfind the equilibrium temperature of the pot. In this simplified model, the\ncooling jug acts as a psychrometer, and the theoretical prediction of our model\nis in a good agreement with psychrometric tables. Next, we study dynamics of\nthe jug cooling. The cooling rate is limited by water vapour diffusion through\nair, heat conduction through air, and heat conduction through the body of the\njug. The derived rate of temperature decrease is in general agreement with the\nresult of our experiment. In the end, we discuss some additional factors, such\nas capillary effects in the raw clay, water viscosity in the capillaries, and\nimpact of complex shape of the jug.\n", "  In this paper, we will analyze the energy dependent deformation of massive\ngravity using the formalism of massive gravity's rainbow. So, we will use the\nVainshtein mechanism and the dRGT mechanism for the energy dependent massive\ngravity, and thus analyze a ghost free theory of massive gravity's rainbow. We\nstudy the energy dependence of a time-dependent geometry, by analyzing the\nradiating Vaidya solution in this theory of massive gravity's rainbow. The\nenergy dependent deformation of this Vaidya metric will be performed using\nsuitable rainbow functions.\n", "  Here we present a new approach to deal with first order ordinary differential\nequations (1ODEs), presenting functions. This method is an alternative to the\none we have presented in [1]. In [2], we have establish the theoretical\nbackground to deal, in the extended Prelle-Singer approach context, with\nsystems of 1ODEs. In this present paper, we will apply these results in order\nto produce a method that is more efficient in a great number of cases.\nDirectly, the solving of 1ODEs is applicable to any problem presenting\nparameters to which the rate of change is related to the parameter itself.\nApart from that, the solving of 1ODEs can be a part of larger mathematical\nprocesses vital to dealing with many problems.\n", "  We propose and experimentally demonstrate a microwave photonic intensity\ndifferentiator based on a Kerr optical comb generated by a compact integrated\nmicro-ring resonator (MRR). The on-chip Kerr optical comb, containing a large\nnumber of comb lines, serves as a high-performance multi-wavelength source for\nimplementing a transversal filter, which will greatly reduce the cost, size,\nand complexity of the system. Moreover, owing to the compactness of the\nintegrated MRR, frequency spacings of up to 200-GHz can be achieved, enabling a\npotential operation bandwidth of over 100 GHz. By programming and shaping\nindividual comb lines according to calculated tap weights, a reconfigurable\nintensity differentiator with variable differentiation orders can be realized.\nThe operation principle is theoretically analyzed, and experimental\ndemonstrations of first-, second-, and third-order differentiation functions\nbased on this principle are presented. The radio frequency (RF) amplitude and\nphase responses of multi-order intensity differentiations are characterized,\nand system demonstrations of real-time differentiations for a Gaussian input\nsignal are also performed. The experimental results show good agreement with\ntheory, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.\n", "  This documents describes the technical design and the expected performance of\nthe Barrel DIRC detector for the PANDA experiment. The Barrel DIRC will provide\nhadronic charged particle identification in the polar angle range of $22^\\circ$\nto $140^\\circ$ for particle momenta between 0.5 GeV/c and 3.5 GeV/c.\n  The design is based on the successful BaBar DIRC with several key\nimprovements. The performance and system cost were optimized in detailed\ndetector simulations and validated with full system prototypes using particle\nbeams at GSI and CERN. The final design meets or exceeds the PID goal of clean\n$\\pi/K$ separation with at least 3 standard deviations over the entire phase\nspace of charged kaons in the Barrel DIRC.\n", "  This work is about Bohmian mechanics, a non-relativistic quantum theory about\nthe motion of particles and their trajectories, named after its inventor David\nBohm (Bohm,1952). This mechanics resolves all paradoxes associated with the\nmeasurement problem in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. It accounts for\nquantum randomness, absolute uncertainty, the meaning of the wave function of a\nsystem, collapse of the wave function, and familiar (macroscopic) reality. We\nreview the purpose for which Bohmian trajectories were invented: to serve as\nthe foundation of quantum mechanics, i.e., to explain quantum mechanics in\nterms of a theory that is free of paradoxes and allows an understanding that is\nas clear as that of classical mechanics. To achieve this we analyse an optical\ninterferometry experiment devised and carried out 2005 by Shahriar Afshar\n(Afshar,2005). The radical claim of Afshar implies in his own words the\n'observation of physical reality in the classical sense' for both 'which path\n(particle-like)' and 'interference (wave-like)' properties of photons in the\nsame experimental setup through the violation of the Englert-Greenberger\nduality relation (Englert,1996) that according to Englert can be regarded as\nquantifying of the 'principle of complementarity'.\n", "  In this note we discuss the CP(N) model in large N limit in saddle point\napproximation on disc and annulus with various combinations of Dirichlet and\nNeumann boundary conditions. We show that homogeneous condensate is not a\nsaddle point in any of considered cases. Behavior of inhomogeneous condensate\nnear boundary is briefly discussed.\n", "  The next galactic core-collapse supernova will deliver a wealth of neutrinos\nwhich for the first time we are well-situated to measure. These explosions\nproduce neutrinos with energies between 10 and 100 MeV over a period of tens of\nseconds. Galactic supernovae are relatively rare events, occurring with a\nfrequency of just a few per century. It is therefore essential that all\nneutrino detectors capable of detecting these neutrinos are ready to trigger on\nthis signal when it occurs. This poster describes a data-driven trigger which\nis designed to detect the neutrino signal from a galactic core-collapse\nsupernova with the NOvA detectors. The trigger analyzes 5ms blocks of detector\nactivity and applies background rejection algorithms to detect the signal time\nstructure over the background. This background reduction is an essential part\nof the process, as the NOvA detectors are designed to detect neutrinos from\nFermilab's NuMI beam which have an average energy of 2GeV--well above the\naverage energy of supernova neutrinos.\n", "  I discuss the role of the Higgs boson as a probe of dark matter and\ninflation.\n", "  Information-theoretic inequalities play a fundamental role in numerous\nscientific and technological areas as they generally express the impossibility\nto have a complete description of a system via a finite number of information\nmeasures. In particular, they gave rise to the design of various quantifiers\n(statistical complexity measures) of the internal complexity of a (quantum)\nsystem. In this paper, we introduce a three-parametric Fisher-R\\'enyi\ncomplexity, named $(p,\\beta,\\lambda)$-Fisher--R\\'enyi complexity. This\ncomplexity measure quantifies the combined balance of the spreading and the\ngradient contents of $\\rho$, and has the three main properties of a statistical\ncomplexity: the invariance under translation and scaling transformations, and a\nuniversal bounding from below. The latter is proved by generalizing the Stam\ninequality, which lowerbounds the product of the Shannon entropy power and the\nFisher information of a probability density function. An extension of this\ninequality was already proposed by Bercher and Lutwak, a particular case of the\ngeneral one, where the three parameters are linked, allowing to determine the\nsharp lower bound and the associated probability density with minimal\ncomplexity. Using the notion of differential-escort deformation, we are able to\ndetermine the sharp bound of the complexity measure even when the three\nparameters are decoupled (in a certain range). We determine as well the\ndistribution that saturates the inequality: the $(p,\\beta,\\lambda)$-Gaussian\ndistribution, which involves an inverse incomplete beta function. Finally, the\ncomplexity measure is calculated for various quantum-mechanical states of the\nharmonic and hydrogenic systems, which are the two main prototypes of physical\nsystems subject to a central potential.\n", "  High angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) affords an\nincrease in angular resolution, as compared to 'conventional' Hough transform\nbased EBSD, of two orders of magnitude, enabling measurements of relative\nmisorientations of 1E-4 rads (~ 0.006 {\\deg}) and changes in (deviatoric)\nlattice strain with a precision of 1E-4. This is achieved through direct\ncomparison of two or more diffraction patterns using sophisticated\ncross-correlation based image analysis routines. Image shifts between zone axes\nin the two-correlated diffraction pattern are measured with sub-pixel precision\nand this realises the ability to measure changes in interplanar angles and\nlattice orientation with a high degree of sensitivity. These shifts are linked\nto strains and lattice rotations through simple geometry. In this manuscript,\nwe outline the basis of the technique and two case studies that highlight its\npotential to tackle real materials science challenges, such as deformation\npatterning in polycrystalline alloys.\n", "  In the membrane paradigm of black holes, it is usually assumed that the\nnormal vector of the stretched horizon has a vanishing acceleration. This\nassumption breaks down for black bottles, a class of solutions discovered\nrecently in the asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime. In this paper, the\nmembrane paradigm is generalized to the stretched horizon with a nonvanishing\nacceleration of normal vector, and then it is applied to the static black\nbottle. In this example, the membrane stress tensor and the fluid quantities\nare similar to those of black holes, while the fluid continuity equation and\nthe Navier-Stokes equation are well satisfied in the near-horizon limit.\n", "  A fast and simple frequency domain method is introduced for the analysis of\nmicroring modulator response using the Jacobi Anger expansion method. Resonance\nfrequency modulated microring (FMMR) modulators and coupling modulated\nmicroring modulators (CMMR) are analyzed using this method. The linearity of\nthese modulators is analyzed. The third order intercept point (IP3) is\ncalculated for CMMR devices and compared to Mach Zehnder interferometer (MZI)\nmodulator devices. It is shown that CMMR devices can achieve a 12dB higher IP3\ncompared to MZI devices. CMMR devices have high second order nonlinearity,\nwhile MZI devices second order nonlinearity is zero. A novel geometry based on\ndual CMMR modulators is introduced to improve the second order nonlinearity of\nCMMR modulators.\n", "  In this paper a homomorphic filtering scheme is proposed to improve the\nestimation of the planet/star radius ratio in astronomical transit signals. The\nidea is to reduce the effect of the short-term earth atmosphere variations. A\ntwo-step method is presented to compute the parameters of the transit curve\nfrom both the unfiltered and filtered data. A Monte Carlo analysis is performed\nby using correlated and uncorrelated noise to determine the parameters of the\nproposed FFT filter. The method is tested with observations of WASP-19b and\nWASP-17b obtained with the FORS2 instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT).\nThe multi parametric fitting and the associated errors are obtained with the\nJKTEBOP software. The results with the white light of the exo-planet data\nmentioned above suggest that the homomorphic filtering can lead to substantial\nrelative reductions in the error bars as high as 45.5% and 76.9%, respectively.\nThe achieved reductions in the averaged error bars per channel were 48.4% with\nWASP-19b and 63.6% with WASP-17b. Open source MATLAB code to run the method\nproposed here can be downloaded from http://www.cmrsp.cl. This code was used to\nobtain the results presented in this paper.\n", "  We investigate the entropy driven large-scale dynamics of semiconducting\nconjugated polymers in solution. Neutron spin echo spectroscopy reveals a\nfinite dynamical stiffness that reduces with increasing temperature and\nmolecular weight. The Zimm mode analysis confirms the existence of beads with a\nfinite length that corresponds to a reduced number of segmental modes in\nsemi-flexible chains. More flexible chains show thermochromic blue-shift in the\nabsorption spectra.\n", "  Within the early Universe, `extreme' star formation may have been the norm\nrather than the exception. Super Star Clusters (SSCs; $M_\\star$ $\\gtrsim$\n10$^5$ M$_\\odot$) are thought to be the modern-day analogs of globular\nclusters, relics of a cosmic time ($z$ $\\gtrsim$ 2) when the Universe was\nfilled with vigorously star-forming systems. The giant HII region 30 Doradus in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is often regarded as a benchmark for studies\nof extreme star formation. Here, we report the discovery of a massive embedded\nstar forming complex spanning $\\sim$ 500 pc in the unexplored southwest region\nof the LMC, which manifests itself as a younger, embedded twin of 30 Doradus.\nPreviously known as N79, this region has a star formation efficiency exceeding\nthat of 30 Doradus by a factor of $\\sim$ 2 as measured over the past $\\lesssim$\n0.5 Myr. Moreover, at the heart of N79 lies the most luminous infrared (IR)\ncompact source discovered with large-scale IR surveys of the LMC and Milky Way,\npossibly a precursor to the central SSC of 30 Doradus, R136. The discovery of a\nnearby candidate SSC may provide invaluable information to understand how\nextreme star formation proceeds in the current and high-redshift Universe.\n"]}
