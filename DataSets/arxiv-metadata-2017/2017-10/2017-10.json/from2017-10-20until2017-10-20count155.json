For this purpose, the Gibbs extremal conditions\nare slightly modified in order to be applied to a wide class of non-equilibrium\nstates. As usual, it is assumed that the system maximizes the entropy\nfunctional $S$, subjected to the standard conditions; i.e., constant energy and\nnormalization of the probability distribution. However, an extra conserved\nconstraint function $F$ is also assumed to exist, which forces the system to\nremain in the metastable configuration. Further, after assuming additivity for\ntwo quasi-independent subsystems, and that the new constraint commutes with\ndensity matrix $\\rho$, it is argued that F should be an homogeneous function of\nthe density matrix, at least for systems in which the spectrum is sufficiently\ndense to be considered as continuous. The explicit form of $F$ turns to be\n$F(p_{i})=p_{i}^{q}$, where $p_i$ are the eigenvalues of the density matrix and\n$q$ is a real number to be determined. This $q$ number appears as a kind of\nTsallis parameter having the interpretation of the order of homogeneity of the\nconstraint $F$. The procedure is applied to describe the results of the plasma\nexperiment of Huang and Driscoll. The experimentally measured density is\npredicted with a similar precision as it is done with the use of the extremum\nof the enstrophy and Tsallis procedures. However, the present results define\nthe density at all the radial positions. In particular, the smooth tail shown\nby the experimental distribution turns to be predicted by the procedure. In\nthis way, the scheme avoids the non-analyticity of the density profile at large\ndistances arising in both of the mentioned alternative procedures.\n", "  The ANTARES telescope observes a full hemisphere of the sky all the time with\na duty cycle close to 100%. This makes it well suited for an extensive\nobservation of neutrinos produced in astrophysical transient sources. In the\nsurrounding medium of blazars, i.e. active galactic nuclei with their jets\npointing almost directly towards the observer, neutrinos may be produced\ntogether with gamma-rays by hadronic interactions, so a strong correlation\nbetween neutrinos and gamma-rays emissions is expected. The time variability\ninformation of the studied source can be obtained by the gamma-ray light curves\nmeasured by the LAT instrument on-board the Fermi satellite. If the expected\nneutrino flux observation is reduced to a narrow window around the assumed\nneutrino production period, the point-source sensitivity can be drastically\nimproved. The ANTARES data collected in 2008 has been analysed looking for\nneutrinos detected in the high state period of ten bright and variable Fermi\nsources assuming that the neutrino emission follows the gamma-ray light curves.\nFirst results show a sensitivity improvement by a factor 2-3 with respect to a\nstandard time-integrated point source search. The analysis has been done with\nan unbinned method based on the minimization of a likelihood ratio applied to\ndata corresponding to a live time of 60 days. The width of the flaring periods\nranges from 1 to 20 days. Despite the fact that the most significant studied\nsource is compatible with background fluctuations, recently detected flares\npromise interesting future analyse.\n", "  The nitrogen-vacancy centre (NV) has drawn much attention for over a decade,\nyet detailed knowledge of the photophysics needs to be established. Under\ntypical conditions, the NV can have two stable charge states, negative (NV-) or\nneutral (NV0), with photo induced interconversion of these two states. Here, we\npresent detailed studies of the ionization dynamics of single NV centres in\nbulk diamond at room temperature during illumination in dependence of the\nexcitation wavelength and power. We apply a recent method which allows us to\ndirectly measure the charge state of a single NV centre, and observe its\ntemporal evolution. Results of this work are the steady state NV- population,\nwhich was found to be always < 75% for 450 to 610 nm excitation wavelength, the\nrelative absorption cross-section of NV- for 540 to 610 nm, and the energy of\nthe NV- ground state of 2.6 eV below the conduction band. These results will\nhelp to further understand the photo-physics of the NV centre.\n", "  We study $N$-electron atoms with nuclear charge $Z$. It is well known that,\nin the cationic ($Z > N$) high-$Z$ region, the atom behaves as a weakly\ninteracting system. The anionic ($Z < N$) regime, on the other hand, is\ncharacterized by an instability threshold at $Z_c \\lesssim N-1$, below which\nthe atom spontaneously emits an electron. We construct a regularized\nperturbative series (RPS) for the ionization potential of ions in an\nisoelectronic sequence that exactly reproduces both, the large $Z$ and the $Z$\nnear $Z_c$ limits. The large-$Z$ expansion coefficients are analytically\ncomputed from perturbation theory, whereas the slope of the energy curve at\n$Z=N-1$ is computed from a kind of zero-range forces theory that uses as input\nthe electron affinity and the covalent radius of the neutral atom with $N-1$\nelectrons. Relativistic effects, at the level of first-order perturbation\ntheory, are considered. Our RPS formula is to be used in order to check the\nconsistency of the ionization potential values for atomic ions contained in the\nNIST database.\n", "  Hybrid quantum systems seek to combine the strength of its constituents to\nmaster the fundamental conflicting requirements of quantum technology: fast and\naccurate systems control together with perfect shielding from the environment,\nincluding the measurements apparatus, to achieve long quantum coherence.\nExcellent examples for hybrid quantum systems are heterogeneous spin systems\nwhere electron spins are used for readout and control while nuclear spins are\nused as long-lived quantum bits. Here we show that joint initialization,\nprojective readout and fast local and non-local gate operations are no longer\nconflicting requirements in those systems, even under ambient conditions. We\ndemonstrate high-fidelity initialization of a whole spin register (99 %) and\nsingle-shot readout of multiple individual nuclear spins by using the ancillary\nelectron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond. Implementation of a\nnovel non-local gate generic to our hybrid electron-nuclear quantum register\nallows to prepare entangled states of three nuclear spins, with fidelities\nexceeding 85 %. An important tool for scalable quantum computation is quantum\nerror correction. Combining, for the first time, optimal-control based error\navoidance with error correction, we realize a three-qubit phase-flip error\ncorrection algorithm. Utilizing optimal control, all of the above algorithms\nachieve fidelities approaching fault tolerant quantum operation, thus paving\nthe way to large scale integrations. Our techniques can be used to improve\nscaling of quantum networks relying on diamond spins, phosphorous in silicon or\nother spin systems like quantum dots, silicon carbide or rare earth ions in\nsolids.\n", "  Single charge detection with nanoscale spatial resolution in ambient\nconditions is a current frontier in metrology that has diverse\ninterdisciplinary applications. Here, such single charge detection is\ndemonstrated using two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. One NV center\nis employed as a sensitive electrometer to detect the change in electric field\ncreated by the displacement of a single electron resulting from the optical\nswitching of the other NV center between its neutral (NV$^0$) and negative\n(NV$^-$) charge states. As a consequence, our measurements also provide direct\ninsight into the charge dynamics inside the material.\n", "  Research on untethered micro-swimming robots is growing fast owing to their\npotential impact on minimally invasive medical procedures. Candidate propulsion\nmechanisms of robots are based on flagellar mechanisms of microorganisms such\nas rotating rigid helices and traveling plane-waves on flexible rods and\nparameterized by wavelength, amplitude, and frequency. For design and control\nof swimming robots, accurate real-time models are necessary to compute\ntrajectories, velocities and hydrodynamic forces acting on robots. Resistive\nforce theory (RFT) provides an excellent framework for the development of\nreal-time six degrees-of-freedom surrogate models for design optimization and\ncontrol. However, the accuracy of RFT-based models depends strongly on\nhydrodynamic interactions. Here, we introduce interaction coefficients that\nonly multiply body resistance coefficients with no modification to local\nresistance coefficients on the tail. Interaction coefficients are obtained for\na single specimen of Vibrio Algino reported in the literature, and used in the\nRFT model for comparisons of the forward-swimming component of the resultant\nvelocities and body rotation rates against other specimens. Furthermore, CFD\nsimulations are used to obtain forward and lateral velocities and body rotation\nrates of bio-inspired swimmers with helical tails and traveling-plane waves for\na range of amplitudes and wavelengths. Interaction coefficients are obtained\nfrom the CFD simulation for the helical tail with the specified amplitude and\nwavelength and used in the RFT model for comparisons of velocities and body\nrotation rates for other designs. Comparisons indicate that hydrodynamic models\nthat employ interaction coefficients prove to be viable surrogates for\ncomputationally intensive three-dimensional time-dependent CFD models.\n", "  The ANTARES telescope, with a duty cycle close to unity and a full hemisphere\nof the sky at all the times visible, is well suited to detect neutrinos\nproduced in astrophysical transient sources. Assuming a known neutrino\nproduction period, the background and the sensitivity can be drastically\nimproved by selecting a narrow time window around it. GRBs, {\\mu}-quasars and\nAGNs are particularly attractive potential neutrino point sources since\nneutrinos and gamma-rays may be produced in hadronic interactions with the\nsurrounding medium as they are the most likely sources of the observed ultra\nhigh energy cosmic rays. A strong correlation between the gamma-ray and the\nneutrino fluxes is expected in this scenario. ANTARES data has been analysed in\nvarious transient source analyses with the goal of detecting cosmic neutrinos\nfrom GRBs, {\\mu}-quasars and AGNs. The sensitivity of a standard\ntime-integrated point source search can be improved by a factor 2-3 by looking\nfor neutrinos only during the most probable emission time. This information can\nbe provided by the different satellite telescope types on the X-rays and\ngamma-rays wavelengths. The results of these different analyses will be\npresented.\n", "  Synthetic diamond production is key to the development of quantum metrology\nand quantum information applications of diamond. The major quantum sensor and\nqubit candidate in diamond is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center. This\nlattice defect comes in four different crystallographic orientations leading to\nan intrinsic inhomogeneity among NV centers that is undesirable in some\napplications. Here, we report a microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor\ndecomposition (MPCVD) diamond growth technique on (111)-oriented substrates\nthat yields perfect alignment ($94\\pm2%$) of as-grown NV centers along a single\ncrystallographic direction. In addition, clear evidence is found that the\nmajority ($74\\pm4%$) of the aligned NV centers were formed by the nitrogen\nbeing first included in the (111) growth surface and then followed by the\nformation of a neighboring vacancy on top. The achieved homogeneity of the\ngrown NV centers will tremendously benefit quantum information and metrology\napplications.\n", "  I present here a new method that allows the introduction of a discrete\nauxiliary symmetry in a theory in such a way that the eigenvalue spectrum of\nthe fermion functional determinant is made up of complex conjugated pairs. The\nmethod implies a particular way of introducing and integrating over auxiliary\nfields related to a set of artificial shift symmetries. Gauge-fixing the\nartificial continuous shift symmetries in the direct and dual sectors leads to\nthe implementation of direct and dual BRST-type global symmetries and of a\nsymplectic structure over the field space (as prescribed by the\nBatalin-Vilkovisky method). A procedure similar to Kahler polarization in\ngeometric quantization guarantees the possibility to choose a Kahler structure\nover the field space. This structure is generated by a special way of\nperforming gauge fixing over the direct and dual sectors. The desired discrete\nsymmetry appears to be induced by the Hodge-* operator. The particular\nextension of the field space presented here makes the operators of the de-Rham\ncohomology manifest. These become symmetries in the extended theory. This\nmethod implies the identification of the (anti)-BRST and dual-(anti)-BRST\noperators with the exterior derivative and its dual in the context of the\ncomplex de-Rham cohomology.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate precision addressing of single quantum emitters\nby combined optical microscopy and spin resonance techniques. To this end we\nutilize nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond confined within a few\nten nanometers as individually resolvable quantum systems. By developing a\nstochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) technique for NV centers\nwe are able to simultaneously perform sub diffraction-limit imaging and\noptically detected spin resonance (ODMR) measurements on NV spins. This allows\nthe assignment of spin resonance spectra to individual NV center locations with\nnanometer scale resolution and thus further improves spatial discrimination.\nFor example, we resolved formerly indistinguishable emitters by their spectra.\nFurthermore, ODMR spectra contain metrology information allowing for sub\ndiffraction-limit sensing of, for instance, magnetic or electric fields with\ninherently parallel data acquisition. As an example, we have detected nuclear\nspins with nanometer scale precision. Finally, we give prospects of how this\ntechnique can evolve into a fully parallel quantum sensor for nanometer\nresolution imaging of delocalized quantum correlations.\n", "  Precision measurement of non-linear observables is an important goal in all\nfacets of quantum optics. This allows measurement-based non-classical state\npreparation, which has been applied to great success in various physical\nsystems, and provides a route for quantum information processing with otherwise\nlinear interactions. In cavity optomechanics much progress has been made using\nlinear interactions and measurement, but observation of non-linear mechanical\ndegrees-of-freedom remains outstanding. Here we report the observation of\ndisplacement-squared thermal motion of a micro-mechanical resonator by\nexploiting the intrinsic non-linearity of the radiation pressure interaction.\nUsing this measurement we generate bimodal mechanical states of motion with\nseparations and feature sizes well below 100~pm. Future improvements to this\napproach will allow the preparation of quantum superposition states, which can\nbe used to experimentally explore collapse models of the wavefunction and the\npotential for mechanical-resonator-based quantum information and metrology\napplications.\n", "  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database on\nionization potentials for neutral atoms and ions is examined. For each\nisoelectronic sequence, we construct a regularized perturbative series that\nexactly matches the large-$Z$ and $Z\\approx N-1$ regions. Comparison of the\nNIST data with this series allows the identification of problematic values in\nthe reported data.\n", "  The present notes are organized as the lectures given at the Les Houches\nSummer School \"Quantum Optics and Nanophotonics\" in August 2013. The first\nsection contains an introduction and a description of the current\nstate-of-the-art for Casimir force measurements and their comparison with\ntheory. The second and third sections are a pedagogical presentation of the\nmain features of the theory of Casimir forces for 1-dimensional model systems\nand for mirrors in 3-dimensional space.\n", "  In this work we analyze a quantum communication scheme for entanglement-based\ncontinuous variable quantum key distribution between two ground stations.\nCommunication occurs via a satellite over two independent atmospheric fading\nchannels dominated by turbulence-induced beam wander. In this scheme the\nengineering complexity remains largely on the ground transceivers, with the\nsatellite acting simply as a reflector. We show how the use of a highly\nselective post-selection strategy may lead to a useful quantum key generation\nrate for this system. This work represents the first quantitative assessment of\ncontinuous variable quantum key rates in the pragmatic scenario of reflection\noff low-earth-orbit satellites.\n", "  Discrete-time switched linear systems where switchings are governed by a\ndigraph are considered. The minimum (or average) dwell time that guarantees the\nasymptotic stability can be computed by calculating the maximum cycle ratio (or\nmaximum cycle mean) of a doubly weighted digraph where weights depend on the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors of subsystem matrices. The graph-based method is\napplied to systems with defective subsystem matrices using Jordan\ndecomposition. In the case of bimodal switched systems scaling algorithms that\nminimizes the condition number can be used to give a better minimum (or\naverage) dwell time estimates.\n", "  We construct a new class of finite-dimensional C^*-quantum groupoids at roots\nof unity q=e^{i\\pi/\\ell}, with limit the discrete dual of the classical SU(N)\nfor large orders. The representation category of our groupoid turns out to be\ntensor equivalent to the well known quotient C^*-category of the category of\ntilting modules of the non-semisimple quantum group U_q({\\mathfrak sl}_N) of\nDrinfeld, Jimbo and Lusztig.\n  As an algebra, the C^*-groupoid is a quotient of U_q({\\mathfrak sl}_N). As a\ncoalgebra, it naturally reflects the categorical quotient construction. In\nparticular, it is not coassociative, but satisfies axioms of the weak\nquasi-Hopf C^*-algebras: quasi-coassociativity and non-unitality of the\ncoproduct. There are also a multiplicative counit, an antipode, and an\nR-matrix.\n  For this, we give a general construction of quantum groupoids for complex\nsimple Lie algebras {\\mathfrak g}\\neq E_8 and certain roots of unity. Our main\ntools here are Drinfeld's coboundary associated to the R-matrix, related to the\nalgebra involution, and certain canonical projections introduced by Wenzl,\nwhich yield the coproduct and Drinfeld's associator in an explicit way.\nTensorial properties of the negligible modules reflect in a rather special\nnature of the associator. We next reduce the proof of the categorical\nequivalence to the problems of establishing semisimplicity and computing\ndimension of the groupoid. In the case {\\mathfrak g}={\\mathfrak sl}_N we\nconstruct a (non-positive) Haar-type functional on an associative version of\nthe dual groupoid satisfying key non-degeneracy properties. This enables us to\ncomplete the proof.\n", "  We examine the conditions of validity for the Lifshitz-Matsubara sum formula\nfor the Casimir pressure between magnetic metallic plane mirrors. As in the\npreviously studied case of non-magnetic materials (Guerout et al, Phys. Rev. E\n90 042125), we recover the usual expression for the lossy model of optical\nresponse, but not for the lossless plasma model. We also show that the modes\nassociated with the Foucault currents play a crucial role in the limit of\nvanishing losses, in contrast to expectations.\n", "  A set of novel derivative terms for spin-2 fields are proposed. They are the\nwedge products of curvature two-forms and vielbeins. In this work, we\ninvestigate the properties of novel two-derivative terms in the context of\nbi-gravity. Based on a minisuperspace analysis, we identify a large class of\nbi-gravity models where the Boulware-Deser ghost could be absent. We give a new\nperspective that Weyl Gravity and New Massive Gravity belong to this class of\nbi-gravity models involving novel derivative terms. In addition, we discuss the\nUV cut-off scales, dynamical symmetric conditions and novel higher-derivative\nterms.\n", "  We study an interferometric approach to measure gravitational mass of\nantihydrogen. The method consists of preparing a coherent superposition of\nantihydrogen quantum state localized near a material surface in the\ngravitational field of the Earth, and then observing the time distribution of\nannihilation events followed after the free fall of an initially prepared\nsuperposition from a given height to the detector plate. We show that a\ncorresponding time distribution is related to the momentum distribution in the\ninitial state that allows its precise measurement. This approach is combined\nwith a method of production of a coherent superposition of gravitational states\nby inducing a resonant transition using oscillating gradient magnetic field. We\nestimate an accuracy of measuring the gravitational mass of antihydrogen atom\nwhich could be deduced from such a measurement.\n", "  Modified gravity which was constructed by torsion scalar $T$, namely $f(T)$\ndoesn't respect Lorentz symmetry. As an attempt to make a new torsion based\nmodified gravity with Lorentz invarianve, recently $f(T,\\mathcal{B})$\nintroduced where $B=2\\nabla_{\\mu}T^{\\mu}$ \\citep{Bahamonde:2015zma}. We would\nargue, even when all is constructed and done in a self-consistent form, if you\nhandle them properly,we observe that there is no Lorentz invariant teleparallel\nequivalent of $f(R)$ gravity. All we found is that the $f(R)$ gravity in which\n$R$ must be computed in Weitzenb\\\"{o}ck spacetime, using Weitzenb\\\"{o}ck's\nconnection, nor Levi-Civita connections is the only possible Lorentz invariant\ntype of modified gravity. Consequently, $f(T)$ gravity can not obey Lorentz\nsymmetry not only in its orthodoxica form but even in this new framework\n$f(T,\\mathcal{B})$.\n", "  Individual donors in silicon chips are used as quantum bits with extremely\nlow error rates. However, physical realizations have been limited to one donor\nbecause their atomic size causes fabrication challenges. Quantum dot qubits, in\ncontrast, are highly adjustable using electrical gate voltages. This\nadjustability could be leveraged to deterministically couple donors to quantum\ndots in arrays of qubits. In this work, we demonstrate the coherent interaction\nof a $^{31}$P donor electron with the electron of a metal-oxide-semiconductor\nquantum dot. We form a logical qubit encoded in the spin singlet and triplet\nstates of the two-electron system. We show that the donor nuclear spin drives\ncoherent rotations between the electronic qubit states through the contact\nhyperfine interaction. This provides every key element for compact two-electron\nspin qubits requiring only a single dot and no additional magnetic field\ngradients, as well as a means to interact with the nuclear spin qubit.\n", "  We study an effect of quenching of antihydrogen quantum states near material\nsurface in the gravitational field of the Earth by local charges randomly\ndistributed along the mirror surface. The quenching mechanism reduces the\nquantum reflection probability because of additional atom-charge interaction\nand nonadiabatic transitions to excited gravitational states. Our approach is\nsuitable for accounting for quenching caused by any kind of additional\ninteraction with the characteristic range much smaller than the typical\ngravitational state wave-length.\n", "  The possibility of formulating quantum mechanics over quaternionic Hilbert\nspaces can be traced back to von Neumann's foundational works in the thirties.\nThe absence of a suitable quaternionic version of spectrum prevented the full\ndevelopment of the theory. The first rigorous quaternionic formulation has been\nstarted only in 2007 with the definition of the spherical spectrum of a\nquaternionic operator based on a quadratic version of resolvent operator. The\nrelevance of this notion is proved by the existence of a quaternionic\ncontinuous functional calculus and a theory of quaternionic semigroups relying\nupon it. A problem of quaternionic formulation is the description of composite\nquantum systems in absence of a natural tensor product due to non-commutativity\nof quaternions. A promising tool towards a solution is a quaternionic\nprojection-valued measure (PVM), making possible a tensor product of\nquaternionic operators with physical relevance. A notion with this property,\ncalled intertwining quaternionic PVM, is presented here. This foundational\npaper aims to investigate the interplay of this new mathematical object and the\nspherical spectral features of quaternionic generally unbounded normal\noperators. We discover in particular the existence of other spectral notions\nequivalent to the spherical ones, but based on a standard non-quadratic notion\nof resolvent operator.\n", "  The generation and control of nanoscale magnetic fields are of fundamental\ninterest in material science and a wide range of applications. Nanoscale\nmagnetic resonance imaging quantum spintronics for example require single spin\ncontrol with high precision and nanoscale spatial resolution using fast\nswitchable magnetic fields with large gradients. Yet, characterizing those\nfields on nanometer length scales at high band width with arbitrary orientation\nhas not been possible so far. Here we demonstrate single electron and nuclear\nspin coherent control using the magnetic field of a hard disc drive write head.\nWe use single electron spins for measuring fields with high spatial resolution\nand single nuclear spins for large band width measurements. We are able to\nderive field profiles from coherent spin Rabi oscillations close to GHz in\nfields with gradients of up to 10 mT/nm and measure all components of a static\nand dynamic magnetic field independent of its orientation. Our method paves the\nway for precision measurement of the magnetic fields of nanoscale write heads\nimportant for future miniaturization of the devices.\n", "  We found that QED in the lowest eigenstate of the microwave-cavity,\ncapacitively coupled with Majorana populated Josephson junctions array, is\ndescribed with an effective $\\phi^{4}$ model emerging in the finite domain of\nthe system parameters. Strong anharmonicity of the cavity mode arises due to\nelectric-dipole phase transition facilitated by the single-electron zero mode\nand Cooper pair tunneling between superconducting islands. An instantonic\nmeandering of the electromagnetic field potential at finite temperatures is\npredicted.\n", "  Space weather events can negatively affect satellites, the electricity grid,\nsatellite navigation systems and human health. As a consequence, extreme space\nweather has been added to the UK and other national risk registers. By their\nvery nature, extreme space weather events occur rarely and, therefore,\nstatistical methods are required to determine the probability of their\noccurrence. Space weather events can be characterised by a number of natural\nphenomena such as X-ray (solar) flares, solar energetic particle (SEP) fluxes,\ncoronal mass ejections and various geophysical indices (Dst, Kp, F10.7). In\nthis paper extreme value theory (EVT) is used to investigate the probability of\nextreme solar flares. Previous work has assumed that the distribution of solar\nflares follows a power law. However such an approach can lead to a poor\nestimation of the return times of such events due to uncertainties in the tails\nof the probability distribution function. Using EVT and GOES X-ray flux data it\nis shown that the expected 150-year return level is approximately an X60 flare\nwhilst a Carrington-like flare is a one in a 100-year event. It is also shown\nthat the EVT results are consistent with flare data from the Kepler space\ntelescope mission.\n", "  We report the numerical solutions of the system of equations, which describes\nthe electrodynamics of s-wave superconductors, for time independent fields and\nhalf-plane superconductor geometry. The results are: i)the applied magnetic\nfield increases the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length and suppresses the\nsuperconductivity, ii)the applied electric field decreases GL coherence length\nand supports the superconductivity, iii) if the applied magnetic field is fixed\nand the applied electric field increases the London penetration depth of the\nmagnetic field decreases. The main conclusion is that applying electric field\nat very low temperature one increases the critical magnetic field. This result\nis experimentally testable.\n", "  We study Higgs pair production with a subsequent decay to a pair of photons\nand a pair of bottoms at the LHC. We use the log-likelihood ratio to identify\nthe kinematic regions which either allow us to separate the di-Higgs signal\nfrom backgrounds or to determine the Higgs self-coupling. We find that both\nregions are separate enough to ensure that details of the background modelling\nwill not affect the determination of the self-coupling. Assuming dominant\nstatistical uncertainties we determine the best precision with which the Higgs\nself- coupling can be probed in this channel. We finally comment on the same\nquestions at a future 100 TeV collider.\n", "  We reply to the \"Comment on 'The Lifshitz-Matsubara sum formula for the\nCasimir pressure between magnetic metallic mirrors'\" [arXiv:1604.06432]. We\nbelieve the comment misrepresents our papers, and fails to provide a plausible\nresolution to the conflict between theory and experiment.\n", "  Extremely powerful astrophysical electromagnetic (EM) system could be\npossible source of high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). Here based on\nproperties of magnetars and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), we address \"Gamma-HFGWs\"\n(with very high-frequency around 10^{20}Hz) caused by ultra-strong EM\nradiations (in the radiation-dominated phase of GRBs fireball) interacting with\nsuper-high magnetar surface magnetic fields (around 10^{11}Tesla). By certain\nparameters of distance and power, the Gamma-HFGWs would have far field energy\ndensity around 10^{-6}, and they would cause perturbed signal EM waves of\naround 10^{-20}Watt/m^2 in planned HFGW detection system based on EM response\nto GWs. Specially, Gamma-HFGWs would possess distinctive envelopes with\ncharacteristic shapes depending on the particular structures of surface\nmagnetic fields of magnetars, which could be exclusive features helpful to\ndistinguish them from background noise. Results obtained suggest that magnetars\ncould involve in possible astrophysical EM sources of GWs in very\nhigh-frequency band, and Gamma-HFGWs would be potential targets for\nobservations in the future.\n", "  Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic layers are of considerable\ninterest for the development of practical cryogenic memory and superconducting\nqubits. Such junctions exhibit a phase shift of $\\pi$ for certain ranges of\nferromagnetic layer thickness. We present studies of Nb based micron-scale\nelliptically-shaped Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic barriers of\nNi$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ or Ni$_{65}$Co$_{20}$Fe$_{15}$. By applying an external\nmagnetic field, the critical current of the junctions are found to follow\ncharacteristic Fraunhofer patterns, and display sharp switching behavior\nsuggestive of single-domain magnets. The high quality of the Fraunhofer\npatterns enables us to extract the maximum value of the critical current even\nwhen the peak is shifted significantly outside the range of the data due to the\nmagnetic moment of the ferromagnetic layer. The maximum value of the critical\ncurrent oscillates as a function of the ferromagnetic barrier thickness,\nindicating transitions in the phase difference across the junction between\nvalues of zero and $\\pi$. We compare the data to previous work and to models of\nthe 0-$\\pi$ transitions based on existing theories.\n", "  Josephson junctions with ferromagnetic layers are vital elements in a new\nclass of cryogenic memory devices. One style of memory device contains a spin\nvalve with one \"hard\" magnetic layer and one \"soft\" layer. To achieve low\nswitching fields, it is advantageous for the soft layer to have low\nmagnetization and low magnetocrystalline anisotropy. A candidate class of\nmaterials that fulfills these criteria is the Pd$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$ alloy system\nwith low Fe concentrations. We present studies of micron-scale\nelliptically-shaped Josephson junctions containing Pd$_{97}$Fe$_{3}$ layers of\nvarying thickness. By applying an external magnetic field, the critical current\nof the junctions are found to follow characteristic Fraunhofer patterns. The\nmaximum value of the critical current, extracted from the Fraunhofer patterns,\noscillates as a function of the ferromagnetic barrier thickness, indicating\ntransitions in the phase difference across the junction between values of zero\nand $\\pi$.\n", "  The process of urbanization is one of the most important phenomenon of our\nsocieties and it is only recently that the availability of massive amounts of\ngeolocalized historical data allows us to address quantitatively some of its\nfeatures. Here, we discuss how the number of buildings evolves with population\nand we show on different datasets (Chicago, $1930-2010$; London, $1900-2015$;\nNew York City, $1790-2013$; Paris, $1861-2011$) that this `fundamental diagram'\nevolves in a possibly universal way with three distinct phases. After an\ninitial pre-urbanization phase, the first phase is a rapid growth of the number\nof buildings versus population. In a second regime, where residences are\nconverted into another use (such as offices or stores for example), the\npopulation decreases while the number of buildings stays approximatively\nconstant. In another subsequent phase, the number of buildings and the\npopulation grow again and correspond to a re-densification of cities. We\npropose a stochastic model based on these simple mechanisms to reproduce the\nfirst two regimes and show that it is in excellent agreement with empirical\nobservations. These results bring evidences for the possibility of constructing\na minimal model that could serve as a tool for understanding quantitatively\nurbanization and the future evolution of cities.\n", "  We propose a route toward realizing fractionalized topological phases of\nmatter (i.e. with intrinsic topological order) by literally building on\nun-fractionalized phases. Our approach employs a Kondo lattice model in which a\ngapped electronic system of non-interacting fermions is coupled to\nnon-interacting local moments via the exchange interaction. Using general\nentanglement-based arguments and explicit lattice models, we show that in this\nway gapped spin liquids can be induced in the spin system. We demonstrate the\npower of this topological bootstrap concept with two examples: (1) a chiral\nspin liquid induced by a Chern insulator and (2) a Z2 spin liquid induced by a\nsuperconductor. In particular, in the latter example, the toric code is\nrealized as an exactly solvable example of topological bootstrap. Our approach\ncan be generalized to all lattices, higher dimensions, and non-abelian\ntopological orders.\n", "  In nanoscale metrology applications, measurements are commonly limited by the\nperformance of the sensor. Here we show that in nuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR) spectroscopy measurements using single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in\ndiamond, the NV sensor electron spin limits spectral resolution down to a few\nhundred Hz, which constraints the characterization and coherent control of\nfinite spin systems, and furthermore, is insufficient for high resolution NMR\nspectroscopy aiming at single molecule recognition and structure analysis of\nthe latter. To overcome the limitation, we support an NV electron spin sensor\nwith a nuclear spin qubit acting as quantum and classical memory allowing for\nintermediate nonvolatile storage of metrology information, while suppressing\nthe deleterious back-action of the sensor onto the system under investigation.\nWe demonstrate quantum and classical memory lifetimes of 8 ms and 4 minutes\nrespectively under ambient conditions. Furthermore, we design and test\nmeasurement and decoupling protocols, which exploit such memory qubits\nefficiently. Using our hybrid quantum-classical sensor device, we achieve high\nresolution NMR spectra with linewidths of single spins down to 13 Hz. Our work\nis therefore a prerequisite for high resolution NMR spectroscopy on nanoscopic\nquantum systems down to the single level.\n", "  We report on the dynamics of localized structures in an inhomogeneous\nSwift-Hohenberg model describing pattern formation in the transverse plane of\nan optical cavity. This real order parameter equation is valid close to the\nsecond order critical point associated with bistability. The optical cavity is\nilluminated by an inhomogeneous spatial gaussian pumping beam, and subjected to\ntime-delayed feedback. The gaussian injection beam breaks the translational\nsymmetry of the system by exerting an attracting force on the localized\nstructure. We show that the localized structure can be pinned to the center of\nthe inhomogeneity, suppressing the delay-induced drift bifurcation that has\nbeen reported in the particular case where the injection is homogeneous,\nassumming a continous wave operation. Under an inhomogeneous spatial pumping\nbeam, we perform the stability analysis of localized solutions to identify\ndifferent instability regimes induced by time-delayed feedback. In particular,\nwe predict the formation of two-arm spirals, as well as oscillating and\ndepinning dynamics caused by the interplay of an attracting inhomogeneity and\ndestabilizing time-delayed feedback. The transition from oscillating to\ndepinning solutions is investigated by means of numerical continuation\ntechniques. Analytically, we use two approaches based on either an order\nparameter equation, describing the dynamics of the localized structure in the\nvicinity of the Hopf bifurcation or an overdamped dynamics of a particle in a\npotential well generated by the inhomogeneity. In the later approach, the\ntime-delayed feedback acts as a driving force.\n", "  An ultracold atom above a horizontal mirror experiences quantum reflection\nfrom the attractive Casimir-Polder interaction, which holds it against gravity\nand leads to quantum levitation states. We analyze this system by using a\nLiouville transformation of the Schr\\\"odinger equation and a Langer coordinate\nadapted to problems with a classical turning point. Reflection on the\nCasimir-Polder attractive well is replaced by reflection on a repulsive wall\nand the problem is then viewed as an ultracold atom trapped inside a cavity\nwith gravity and Casimir-Polder potentials acting respectively as top and\nbottom mirrors. We calculate numerically Casimir-Polder shifts of the energies\nof the cavity resonances and propose a new approximate treatment which is\nprecise enough to discuss spectroscopy experiments aiming at tests of the weak\nequivalence principle on antihydrogen. We also discuss the lifetimes by\ncalculating complex energies associated with cavity resonances.\n", "  We study the global structure of dyonic fields on a Taub-Bolt background, and\ncompare our results with similar fields over Taub-NUT and Schwarzschild spaces.\nIt is shown that the electric and magnetic charges are quantized and lead to a\nclassification of dyonic Taub-Bolt configurations. The quantization condition\nfor the magnetic charge is similar to that of Dirac's monopole.\n", "  We introduce the atomic valence active space (AVAS), a simple and\nwell-defined automated technique for constructing active orbital spaces for use\nin multi-configuration and multireference (MR) electronic structure\ncalculations. Concretely, the technique constructs active molecular orbitals\ncapable of describing all relevant electronic configurations emerging from a\ntargeted set of atomic valence orbitals (e.g., the metal d orbitals in a\ncoordination complex). This is achieved via a linear transformation of the\noccupied and unoccupied orbital spaces from an easily obtainable\nsingle-reference wavefunction (such as from a Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham\ncalculations) based on projectors to targeted atomic valence orbitals. We\ndiscuss the premises, theory, and implementation of the idea, and several of\nits variations are tested. To investigate the performance and accuracy, we\ncalculate the excitation energies for various transition metal complexes in\ntypical application scenarios. Additionally, we follow the homolytic bond\nbreaking process of a Fenton reaction along its reaction coordinate. While the\ndescribed AVAS technique is not an universal solution to the active space\nproblem, its premises are fulfilled in many application scenarios of transition\nmetal chemistry and bond dissociation processes. In these cases the technique\nmakes MR calculations easier to execute, easier to reproduce by any user, and\nsimplifies the determination of the appropriate size of the active space\nrequired for accurate results.\n", "  We discuss, in the context of energy flow in high-dimensional systems and\nKolmogorov-Arnol'd-Moser (KAM) theory, the behavior of a chain of rotators\n(rotors) which is purely Hamiltonian, apart from dissipation at just one end.\nWe derive bounds on the dissipation rate which become arbitrarily small in\ncertain physical regimes, and we present numerical evidence that these bounds\nare sharp. We relate this to the decoupling of non-resonant terms as is known\nin KAM problems.\n", "  We give a brief exposition of the formulation of the bound state problem for\nthe one-dimensional system of $N$ attractive Dirac delta potentials, as an $N\n\\times N$ matrix eigenvalue problem ($\\Phi A =\\omega A$). The main aim of this\npaper is to illustrate that the non-degeneracy theorem in one dimension breaks\ndown for the equidistantly distributed Dirac delta potential, where the matrix\n$\\Phi$ becomes a special form of the circulant matrix. We then give an\nelementary proof that the ground state is always non-degenerate and the\nassociated wave function may be chosen to be positive by using the\nPerron-Frobenius theorem. We also prove that removing a single center from the\nsystem of $N$ delta centers shifts all the bound state energy levels upward as\na simple consequence of the Cauchy interlacing theorem.\n", "  In this paper we promote a method for the evaluation of a surface topography\nwhich we call the correlogram correlation method. Employing a theoretical\nanalysis as well as numerical simulations the method is proven to be the most\naccurate among available evaluation algorithms in the common case of\nuncorrelated noise. Examples illustrate the superiority of the correlogram\ncorrelation method over the common envelope and phase methods.\n", "  We theoretically show that, despite Earnshaw's theorem, a non-rotating single\nmagnetic domain nanoparticle can be stably levitated in an external static\nmagnetic field. The stabilization relies on the quantum spin origin of\nmagnetization, namely the gyromagnetic effect. We predict the existence of two\nstable phases related to the Einstein--de Haas effect and the Larmor\nprecession. At a stable point, we derive a quadratic Hamiltonian that describes\nthe quantum fluctuations of the degrees of freedom of the system. We show that\nin the absence of thermal fluctuations, the quantum state of the nanomagnet at\nthe equilibrium point contains entanglement and squeezing.\n", "  Many transitional wall-bounded shear flows are characterised by the\ncoexistence in state-space of laminar and turbulent regimes. Probing the edge\nboundary between the two attractors has led in the last decade to the numerical\ndiscovery of new (unstable) solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations. However, the iterative bisection method used to achieve this can\nbecome prohibitively costly for large systems. Here we suggest a simple\nfeedback control strategy to stabilise edge states, hence accelerating their\nnumerical identification by several orders of magnitude. The method is\nillustrated for several configurations of cylindrical pipe flow. Travelling\nwaves solutions are identified as edge states, and can be isolated rapidly in\nonly one short numerical run. A new branch of solutions is also identified.\nWhen the edge state is a periodic orbit or chaotic state, the feedback control\ndoes not converge precisely to solutions of the uncontrolled system, but\nnevertheless brings the dynamics very close to the original edge manifold in a\nsingle run. We discuss the opportunities offered by the speed and simplicity of\nthis new method to probe the structure of both state space and parameter space.\n", "  Many astrophysical plasmas are prone to beam-plasma instabilities. For\nrelativistic and dilute beams, the {\\it spectral} support of the beam-plasma\ninstabilities is narrow, i.e., the linearly unstable modes that grow with rates\ncomparable to the maximum growth rate occupy a narrow range of wave numbers.\nThis places stringent requirements on the box-sizes when simulating the\nevolution of the instabilities. We identify the implied lower limits on the box\nsize imposed by the longitudinal beam plasma instability, i.e., typically the\nmost stringent condition required to correctly capture the linear evolution of\nthe instabilities in multidimensional simulations. We find that sizes many\norders of magnitude larger than the resonant wavelength are typically required.\nUsing one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we show that the failure to\nsufficiently resolve the spectral support of the longitudinal instability\nyields slower growth and lower levels of saturation, potentially leading to\nerroneous physical conclusion.\n", "  Small evaporating black holes were proposed to be dangerous inducing fast\ndecay of the electroweak false vacuum. We observe that the flat-spectrum matter\nperturbations growing at the post-inflationary matter dominated stage can\nproduce such black holes in a tiny amount which may nevertheless be sufficient\nto destroy the vacuum in the visible part of the Universe via the induced\nprocess. If the decay probability in the vicinity of Planck-mass black holes\nwas of order one as suggested in literature, the absence of such objects in the\nearly Universe would put severe constraints on inflation and subsequent stages\nthus excluding many well-motivated models (e.g. the R^2-inflation) and\nsupporting the need of new physics in the Higgs sector. We give a qualitative\nargument, however, that exponential suppression of the probability should\npersist in the limit of small black hole masses. This suppression relaxes our\ncosmological constraints, and, if sufficiently strong, may cancel them.\n", "  Recent experiments have revealed the possibility of precise electron beam\nmanipulation of silicon impurities in graphene. Motivated by these findings and\nstudies on metal surface quantum corrals, the question arises what kind of\nembedded Si structures are possible within the hexagonal lattice, and how these\nare limited by the distortion caused by the preference of Si for $sp^{3}$\nhybridization. In this work, we study the geometry and stability of elementary\nSi patterns in graphene, including lines, hexagons, triangles, circles and\nsquares. Due to the size of the required unit cells, to obtain the relaxed\ngeometries we use an empirical bond-order potential as a starting point for\ndensity functional theory. Despite some interesting discrepancies, the\nclassical geometries provide an effective route for the simulation of large\nstructures.\n", "  A new approach to turbulence simulation, based on a combination of large-eddy\nsimulation (LES) for the whole flow and an array of non-space-filling\nquasi-direct numerical simulations (QDNS), which sample the response of\nnear-wall turbulence to large-scale forcing, is proposed and evaluated. The\ntechnique overcomes some of the cost limitations of turbulence simulation,\nsince the main flow is treated with a coarse-grid LES, with the equivalent of\nwall functions supplied by the near-wall sampled QDNS. Two cases are tested, at\nfriction Reynolds number Re$_\\tau$=4200 and 20,000. The total grid node count\nfor the first case is less than half a million and less than two million for\nthe second case, with the calculations only requiring a desktop computer. A\ngood agreement with published DNS is found at Re$_\\tau$=4200, both in terms of\nthe mean velocity profile and the streamwise velocity fluctuation statistics,\nwhich correctly show a substantial increase in near-wall turbulence levels due\nto a modulation of near-wall streaks by large-scale structures. The trend\ncontinues at Re$_\\tau$=20,000, in agreement with experiment, which represents\none of the major achievements of the new approach. A number of detailed aspects\nof the model, including numerical resolution, LES-QDNS coupling strategy and\nsub-grid model are explored. A low level of grid sensitivity is demonstrated\nfor both the QDNS and LES aspects. Since the method does not assume a law of\nthe wall, it can in principle be applied to flows that are out of equilibrium.\n", "  We investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of cavity solitons in a broad area\nvertical-cavity surface-emitting laser with saturable absorption subjected to\ntime-delayed optical feedback. Using a combination of analytical, numerical and\npath continuation methods we analyze the bifurcation structure of stationary\nand moving cavity solitons and identify two different types of traveling\nlocalized solutions, corresponding to slow and fast motion. We show that the\ndelay impacts both stationary and moving solutions either causing drifting and\nwiggling dynamics of initially stationary cavity solitons or leading to\nstabilization of intrinsically moving solutions. Finally, we demonstrate that\nthe fast cavity solitons can be associated with a lateral mode-locking regime\nin a broad-area laser with a single longitudinal mode.\n", "  Master equations are increasingly popular for the simulation of\ntime-dependent electronic transport in nanoscale devices. Several recent\nMarkovian approaches use \"extended reservoirs\" - explicit degrees of freedom\nassociated with the electrodes - distinguishing them from many previous classes\nof master equations. Starting from a Lindblad equation, we develop a common\nfoundation for these approaches. Due to the incorporation of explicit electrode\nstates, these methods do not require a large bias or even \"true Markovianity\"\nof the reservoirs. Nonetheless, their predictions are only physically relevant\nwhen the Markovian relaxation is weaker than the thermal broadening and when\nthe extended reservoirs are \"sufficiently large,\" in a sense that we quantify.\nThese considerations hold despite complete positivity and respect for Pauli\nexclusion at any relaxation strength.\n", "  Laser induced transitions between internal states of atoms have been playing\na fundamental role to manipulate atomic clouds for many decades. In absence of\ninteractions each atom behaves independently and their coherent quantum\ndynamics is described by the Rabi model. Since the experimental observation of\nBose condensation in dilute gases, static and dynamical properties of\nmulticomponent quantum gases have been extensively investigated. Moreover, at\nvery low temperatures quantum fluctuations crucially affect the equation of\nstate of many-body systems. Here we study the effects of quantum fluctuations\non a Rabi-coupled two-component Bose gas of interacting alkali atoms. The\ndivergent zero-point energy of gapless and gapped elementary excitations of the\nuniform system is properly regularized obtaining a meaningful analytical\nexpression for the beyond-mean-field equation of state. In the case of\nattractive inter-particle interaction we show that the quantum pressure arising\nfrom Gaussian fluctuations can prevent the collapse of the mixture with the\ncreation of a self-bound droplet. We characterize the droplet phase and\ndiscover an energetic instability above a critical Rabi frequency provoking the\nevaporation of the droplet. Finally, we suggest an experiment to observe such\nquantum droplets using Rabi-coupled internal states of $^{39}$K atoms.\n", "  A new Short-Orbit Spectrometer (SOS) has been constructed and installed\nwithin the experimental facility of the A1 collaboration at Mainz Microtron\n(MAMI), with the goal to detect low-energy pions. It is equipped with a\nBrowne-Buechner magnet and a detector system consisting of two helium-ethane\nbased drift chambers and a scintillator telescope made of five layers. The\ndetector system allows detection of pions in the momentum range of 50 - 147\nMeV/c, which corresponds to 8.7 - 63 MeV kinetic energy. The spectrometer can\nbe placed at a distance range of 54 - 66 cm from the target center. Two\ncollimators are available for the measurements, one having 1.8 msr aperture and\nthe other having 7 msr aperture. The Short-Orbit Spectrometer has been\nsuccessfully calibrated and used in coincidence measurements together with the\nstandard magnetic spectrometers of the A1 collaboration.\n", "  We study the propagation of light bundles in non-empty spacetime, as most of\nthe Universe is filled by baryonic matter in the form of a (dilute) plasma.\nHere we restrict to the case of a cold (i.e., pressureless) and non-magnetised\nplasma. Then the influence of the medium on the light rays is encoded in the\nspacetime dependent plasma frequency. Our result for a general spacetime\ngeneralises the Sachs equations to the case of a cold plasma Universe. We find\nthat the reciprocity law (Etherington theorem), the relation that connects area\ndistance with luminosity distance, is modified. Einstein's field equation is\nnot used, i.e., our results apply independently of whether or not the plasma is\nself-gravitating. As an example, our findings are applied to a homogeneous\nplasma in a Robertson-Walker spacetime. We find small modifications of the\ncosmological redshift of frequencies and of the Hubble law.\n", "  We study field-driven magnetic domain wall dynamics in garnet strips by\nlarge-scale three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations. The domain wall\npropagation velocity as a function of the applied field exhibits a low-field\nlinear part terminated by a sudden velocity drop at a threshold field\nmagnitude, related to the onset of excitations of internal degrees of freedom\nof the domain wall magnetization. By considering a wide range of strip\nthicknesses from 30 nm to 1.89 $\\mu$m, we find a non-monotonic thickness\ndependence of the threshold field for the onset of this instability, proceeding\nvia nucleation and propagation of Bloch lines within the domain wall. We\nidentify a critical strip thickness above which the velocity drop is due to\nnucleation of horizontal Bloch lines, while for thinner strips and depending on\nthe boundary conditions employed, either generation of vertical Bloch lines, or\nclose-to-uniform precession of the domain wall internal magnetization takes\nplace. For strips of intermediate thicknesses, the vertical Bloch lines assume\na deformed structure due to demagnetizing fields at the strip surfaces,\nbreaking the symmetry between the top and bottom faces of the strip, and\nresulting in circulating Bloch line dynamics along the perimeter of the domain\nwall.\n", "  We study the finite temperature phase structure for three-flavor QCD with a\nfocus on locating the critical point which separates crossover and first order\nphase transition region in the chiral regime of the Columbia plot. In this\nstudy, we employ the Iwasaki gauge action and the non-perturvatively O($a$)\nimproved Wilson-Clover fermion action. We discuss the finite size scaling\nanalysis including the mixing of magnetization-like and energy-like\nobservables. We carry out the continuum extrapolation of the critical point\nusing newly generated data at $N_{\\rm t}=8$, $10$ and estimate the upper bound\nof the critical pseudo-scalar meson mass $m_{\\rm PS,E} \\lesssim 170 {\\rm MeV}$\nand the critical temperature $T_{\\rm E}=134(3){\\rm MeV}$. Our estimate of the\nupper bound is derived from the existence of the critical point as an edge of\nthe 1st order phase transition while that of the staggered-type fermions is\nbased on its absence.\n", "  The proximity-induced superconducting state in the 3-dimensional topological\ninsulator HgTe has been studied using electronic transport of a normal\nmetal-superconducting point contact as a spectroscopic tool (Andreev point\ncontact spectroscopy). By analyzing the conductance as a function of voltage\nfor various temperatures, magnetic fields and gate-voltages, we find evidence,\nin equilibrium, for an induced order parameter in HgTe of $70\\,\\mu$eV and a\nniobium order parameter of $1.1\\,$meV. To understand the full conductance curve\nas a function of applied voltage we suggest a non-equilibrium driven\ntransformation of the quantum transport process where the relevant scattering\nregion and equilibrium reservoirs change with voltage. This implies that the\nspectroscopy probes the superconducting correlations at different positions in\nthe sample, depending on the bias voltage.\n", "  Quantum Measure Theory (QMT) is an approach to quantum mechanics, based on\nthe path integral, in which quantum theory is conceived of as a generalised\nstochastic process. One of the postulates of QMT is that events with zero\nquantum measure do not occur, however this is not sufficient to give a full\npicture of the quantum world. Determining the other postulates is a work in\nprogress and this paper investigates a proposal called the Multiplicative\nScheme for QMT in which the physical world corresponds, essentially, to a set\nof histories from the path integral. This scheme is applied to Sorkin's\n$n$-site hopper, a discrete, unitary model of a single particle on a ring of\n$n$ sites, motivated by free Schr\\\"odinger propagation. It is shown that the\nmultiplicative scheme's global features lead to the conclusion that no\nnon-trivial, time-finite event can occur.\n", "  Reconstructing noise-driven nonlinear networks from time series of output\nvariables is a challenging problem, which turns to be very difficult when\nnonlinearity of dynamics, strong noise impacts and low measurement frequencies\njointly affect. In this Letter, we propose a general method that introduces a\nnumber of nonlinear terms of the measurable variables as artificial and new\nvariables, and uses the expanded variables to linearize nonlinear differential\nequations. Moreover, we use two-time correlations to decompose effects of\nsystem dynamics and noise driving. With these transformations, reconstructing\nnonlinear dynamics of the original system is equivalent to solving linear\ndynamics of the expanded system at the least squares approximations. We can\nwell reconstruct nonlinear networks, including all dynamic nonlinearities,\nnetwork links, and noise statistical characteristics, as sampling frequency is\nrather low. Numerical results fully verify the validity of theoretical\nderivations.\n", "  Asymptotics of quantum $6j$ symbols corresponding to a hyperbolic tetrahedra\nis investigated and the first two leading terms are determined for the case\nthat the tetrahedron has a ideal or ultra-ideal vertex. These terms are given\nby the volume and the determinant of the Gram matrix of the tetrahedron. A\nrelation to the volume conjecture of the Turaev-Viro invariant is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Quantum information storage using charge-neutral quasiparticles are expected\nto play a crucial role in the future of quantum computers. In this regard,\nmagnons or collective spin-wave excitations in solid-state materials are\npromising candidates in the future of quantum computing. Here, we study the\nquantum squeezing of Dirac and topological magnons in a bosonic honeycomb\noptical lattice with spin-orbit interaction by utilizing the mapping to quantum\nspin-$1/2$ XYZ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice with discrete Z$_2$\nsymmetry and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We show that the squeezed\nmagnons can be controlled by the Z$_2$ anisotropy and demonstrate how the noise\nin the system is periodically modified in the ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic phases of the model. Our results also apply to solid-state\nhoneycomb (anti)ferromagnetic insulators.\n", "  Focused ion beam milling allows manipulation of the shape and size of\nnanostructures to create geometries potentially useful for opto-electronics,\nthermoelectrics, and quantum computing. We focus on using the ion beam to\ncontrol the thickness of Bi2Se3 and to create nanowires from larger structures.\nChanges in the material structure of Bi2Se3 nanomaterials that have been milled\nusing a focused ion beam are presented. In order to characterize the effects of\nion beam processing on the samples, we use a variety of techniques including\nanalytical transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The\nresults show that while part of the material remains intact after shaping,\namorphous regions form where the beam has been used to thin the sample. For\nwires created by thinning the material down to the substrate, the sidewalls of\nthe wires appear intact based on diffraction images from samples cut at an\nangle, but thin crystalline regions remain at the wire edges. Even with the\nresulting defects, focused ion beam milling shows promise for directly\nfabricating intricate nanodevices of Bi2Se3.\n", "  In 1822, Cauchy presented the idea of traction vector that contains both the\nnormal and tangential components of the internal surface forces per unit area\nand gave the tetrahedron argument to prove the existence of stress tensor.\nThese great achievements form the main part of the foundation of continuum\nmechanics. For about two centuries, some versions of tetrahedron argument and a\nfew other proofs of the existence of stress tensor are presented in every text\non continuum mechanics, fluid mechanics, and the relevant subjects. In this\narticle, we show the birth, importance, and location of these Cauchy's\nachievements, then by presenting the formal tetrahedron argument in detail, for\nthe first time, we extract some fundamental challenges. These conceptual\nchallenges are related to the result of applying the conservation of linear\nmomentum to any mass element, the order of magnitude of the surface and volume\nterms, the definition of traction vectors on the surfaces that pass through the\nsame point, the approximate processes in the derivation of stress tensor, and\nsome others. In a comprehensive review, we present the different tetrahedron\narguments and the proofs of the existence of stress tensor, discuss the\nchallenges in each one, and classify them in two general approaches. In the\nfirst approach that is followed in most texts, the traction vectors do not\nexactly define on the surfaces that pass through the same point, so most of the\nchallenges hold. But in the second approach, the traction vectors are defined\non the surfaces that pass exactly through the same point, therefore some of the\nrelevant challenges are removed. We also study the improved works of Hamel and\nBackus, and indicate that the original work of Backus removes most of the\nchallenges. This article shows that the foundation of continuum mechanics is\nnot a finished subject and there are still some fundamental challenges.\n", "  The magnetic properties of ferromagnetic thin films down to the nanoscale are\nruled by the exchange stiffness, anisotropies and the effects of magnetic\nfields. As surfaces break inversion symmetry, an additional effective chiral\nexchange is omnipresent in any magnetic nanostructure. These so-called\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) affect all inhomogeneous magnetic\nstates either subtly or spectacularly. E.g., DMIs cause a chirality selection\nof the rotation sense and can fix the local rotation axis for the magnetization\nin domain walls (DW). But, they can stabilize also entirely different twisted\nmagnetic structures. The chiral skyrmions a two-dimensional particle-like\ntopological soliton is the ultimately smallest of these objects, which\ncurrently is targetted as a possible information carrier in novel spintronic\ndevices. Observation and quantification of the chiral exchange effects provide\nfor the salient point in understanding magnetic properties in ultrathin films\nand other nanostructures. An easy and reliable method to determine the DMI\nconstant as materials parameter of asymmetric thin films is the crucial\nproblem. Here, we put forth an experimental approach for the determination of\nthe complete set of the micromagnetic parameters. Quasi-static Kerr microcopy\nobservations of DW creep motion and equilibrium sizes of circular magnetic\nobjects in combination with standard magnetometry are used to derive a\nconsistent set of these materials parameters in polycrystalline ultrathin film\nsystems, namely CrOx/Co/Pt stacks. The quantified micromagnetic model for these\nfilms identifies the circular magnetic objects, as seen by the optical\nmicroscopy, as ordinary bubble domains with homochiral walls. From\nmicromagnetic calculations, the chiral skyrmions stabilized by the DMI in these\nfilms are shown to have diameters in the range 40-200nm, too small to be\nobserved by optical microscopy.\n", "  We compute physical properties across the phase diagram of the $t$-$J_\\perp$\nchain with long-range dipolar interactions, which describe ultracold polar\nmolecules on optical lattices. Our results obtained by the density-matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) indicate that superconductivity is enhanced when\nthe Ising component $J_z$ of the spin-spin interaction and the charge component\n$V$ are tuned to zero, and even further by the long-range dipolar interactions.\nAt low densities, a substantially larger spin gap is obtained. We provide\nevidence that long-range interactions lead to algebraically decaying\ncorrelation functions despite the presence of a gap. Although this has recently\nbeen observed in other long-range interacting spin and fermion models, the\ncorrelations in our case have the peculiar property of having a small and\ncontinuously varying exponent. We construct simple analytic models and\narguments to understand the most salient features.\n", "  We investigate the fate of hardcore bosons in a Harper-Hofstadter model which\nwas experimentally realized by Aidelsburger et al. [Nature Physics 11 , 162\n(2015)] at half filling of the lowest band. We discuss the stability of an\nemergent fractional Chern insulator (FCI) state in a finite region of the phase\ndiagram that is separated from a superfluid state by a first-order transition\nwhen tuning the band topology following the protocol used in the experiment.\nSince crossing a first-order transition is unfavorable for adiabatically\npreparing the FCI state, we extend the model to stabilize a featureless\ninsulating state. The transition between this phase and the topological state\nproves to be continuous, providing a path in parameter space along which an FCI\nstate could be adiabatically prepared. To further corroborate this statement,\nwe perform time-dependent DMRG calculations which demonstrate that the FCI\nstate may indeed be reached by adiabatically tuning a simple product state.\n", "  Domain walls separating regions of AB and BA interlayer stacking in bilayer\ngraphene have attracted attention as novel examples of structural solitons,\ntopological electronic boundaries, and nanoscale plasmonic scatterers. We show\nthat strong coupling of domain walls to surface plasmons observed in infrared\nnanoimaging experiments is due to topological chiral modes confined to the\nwalls. The optical transitions among these chiral modes and the band continua\nenhance the local ac conductivity, which leads to plasmon reflection by the\ndomain walls. The imaging reveals two kinds of plasmonic standing-wave\ninterference patterns, which we attribute to shear and tensile domain walls. We\ncompute the electronic structure of both wall varieties and show that the\ntensile wall contain additional confined bands which produce a\nstructure-specific contrast of the local conductivity. The calculated plasmonic\ninterference profiles are in quantitative agreement with our experiments.\n", "  We study the dihadron fragmentation functions (DiFF) of longitudinally\npolarized quarks into pion pairs. The quark-jet framework is used to model the\nsequential hadronization of a polarized quark into hadrons, where the\npolarization transfer to the remnant quark in each hadron emission step is\ncalculated using the spin density matrix formalism. Using Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations of the hadronization process, we find a nonvanishing helicity\ndependent DiFF, $G_1^\\perp$ , which is also related to the longitudinal jet\nhandedness. A method is developed for extracting the angular moments of this\nDiFF, which enter the expressions for the azimuthal asymmetries for an\nelectron-positron annihilation process into two pairs of hadrons from\nback-to-back jets and the dihadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic\nscattering. Finally, we derive explicit integral expressions for DiFFs where\nonly two hadrons are emitted by a quark and use them to validate our MC results\nfor both unpolarized and helicity dependent DiFFs.\n", "  We systematically investigate the magnetic properties and local structure of\nBa2YIrO6 to demonstrate that Y and Ir lattice defects in the form of antiphase\nboundary or clusters of antisite disorder affect the magnetism observed in this\n$d^4$ compound. We compare the magnetic properties and atomic imaging of (1) a\nslow cooled crystal, (2) a crystal quenched from 900\\degree C after growth, and\n(3) a crystal grown using a faster cooling rate than the slow cooled one.\nAtomic imaging by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) shows that\nquenching from 900oC introduces antiphase boundary to the crystals, and a\nfaster cooling rate during crystal growth leads to clusters of Y and Ir\nantisite disorder. STEM study suggests the antiphase boundary region is Ir-rich\nwith a composition of Ba2YIrO6. The magnetic measurements show that Ba2YIrO6\ncrystals with clusters of antisite defects have a larger effective moment and a\nlarger saturation moment than the slow-cooled crystals. Quenched crystals with\nIr-rich antiphase boundary shows a slightly suppressed saturation moment than\nthe slow cooled crystals, and this seems to suggest that antiphase boundary is\ndetrimental to the moment formation. Our DFT calculations suggest magnetic\ncondensation is unlikely as the energy to be gained from superexchange is small\ncompared to the spin-orbit gap. However, once Y is replaced by Ir in the\nantisite disordered region, the picture of local non-magnetic singlets breaks\ndown and magnetism can be induced. This is because of (a) enhanced interactions\ndue to increased overlap of orbitals between sites, and, (b) increased number\nof orbitals mediating the interactions. Our work highlights the importance of\nlattice defects in understanding the experimentally observed magnetism in\nBa2YIrO6 and other J=0 systems.\n", "  We consider forward inclusive production of two quarks in the high energy p-A\ncollisions in the CGC formalism. We demonstrate that the production\ncross-section is determined by the convolution of the proton generalized double\ntransverse momentum-dependent distribution (2GTMD) functions with two\nindependent eikonal scattering amplitudes: the product of two dipoles and a\nquadrupole. We explicitly demonstrate that the quadrupole amplitude term\naccounts for all the (initial and final state) effects of quantum statistics\nfor identical fermions, and the correlations due to these effects. We also\ndemonstrate that the effects due to quantum statistics (entirely encoded in the\nquadrupole) are parametrically leading contributions to the correlated particle\nproduction at large $N_c$. For non-identical quarks the quadrupole term also\nleads to correlated production which has characteristics similar to the HBT\neffect.\n", "  With the parameters fitted by the particle multiplicity, the energy density\nat chemical freeze-out, and the charged particle elliptic flow, we have studied\nthe effects of the hadronic mean-field potentials on the Hanbury-Brown and\nTwiss (HBT) correlation in relativistic heavy-ion collisions based on a\nmultiphase transport model. The hadronic mean-field potentials are found to\ndelay the emission time of the system and lead to large HBT radii extracted\nfrom the correlation function. Effects on the energy dependence of\n$R_o^2-R_s^2$ and $R_{o}/ R_{s}$ as well as the eccentricity of the emission\nsource are discussed. The HBT correlations can also be useful in understanding\nthe mean-field potentials of protons, kaons, and antiprotons as well as\nbaryon-antibaryon annihilations.\n", "  Motivated by the existence of hierarchies of structure in the Universe, we\npresent four new families of exact initial data for inhomogeneous cosmological\nmodels at their maximum of expansion. These data generalise existing black hole\nlattice models to situations that contain clusters of masses, and hence allow\nthe consequences of cosmological structures to be considered in a well-defined\nand non-perturbative fashion. The degree of clustering is controlled by a\nparameter $\\lambda$, in such a way that for $\\lambda \\sim 0$ or $1$ we have\nvery tightly clustered masses, whilst for $\\lambda \\sim 0.5$ all masses are\nseparated by cosmological distance scales. We study the consequences of\nstructure formation on the total net mass in each of our clusters, as well as\ncalculating the cosmological consequences of the interaction energies both\nwithin and between clusters. The locations of the shared horizons that appear\naround groups of black holes, when they are brought sufficiently close\ntogether, are also identified and studied. We find that clustering can have\nsurprisingly large effects on the scale of the cosmology, with models that\ncontain thousands of black holes sometimes being as little as 30% of the size\nof comparable Friedmann models with the same total proper mass. This deficit is\ncomparable to what might be expected to occur from neglecting gravitational\ninteraction energies in Friedmann cosmology, and suggests that these quantities\nmay have a significant influence on the properties of the large-scale\ncosmology.\n", "  The connection between entanglement and topology manifests itself in the form\nof the ER-EPR duality. This statement however refers to the maximally entangled\nstates only. In this article I study the multipartite entanglement and the way\nin which it relates to the topological interpretation of the ER-EPR duality.\nThe $2$ dimensional genus $1$ torus will be generalised to a $n$-dimensional\ngeneral torus, where the information about the multipartite entanglement will\nbe encoded in the higher inclusion maps of the Mayer-Vietorist sequence.\n", "  Using the DAMA/LIBRA anomaly as an example, we formalise the notion of\nhalo-independence in the context of Bayesian statistics and quantified maximum\nentropy. We consider an infinite set of possible profiles, weighted by an\nentropic prior and constrained by a likelihood describing noisy measurements of\nmodulated moments by DAMA/LIBRA. Assuming an isotropic dark matter (DM) profile\nin the galactic rest frame, we find the most plausible DM profiles and\npredictions for unmodulated signal rates at DAMA/LIBRA. The entropic prior\ncontains an a priori unknown regularisation factor, $\\beta$, that describes the\nstrength of our conviction that the profile is approximately Maxwellian. By\nvarying $\\beta$, we smoothly interpolate between a halo-independent and a\nhalo-dependent analysis, thus exploring the impact of prior information about\nthe DM profile.\n", "  We investigate the self-compensation mechanism in phosphorus-doped CdTe. The\nformation energies, charge transition levels, and defects states of several\nP-related point defects susceptible to cause self-compensation are addressed by\nfirst-principles calculations. Moreover, we assess the in uence of the\nspin-orbit coupling and supercell-size effects on the stability of AX centers\ndonors, which are believed to be responsible for most of the self-compensation.\nWe report an improved result for the lowest-energy configuration of the P\ninterstitial (P$_\\text{i}$) and find that the self-compensation mechanism is\nnot due to the formation of AX centers. Under Te-rich growth conditions,\n(P$_\\text{i}$) exhibits a formation energy lower than the substitutional\nacceptor (P$_\\text{Te}$) when the Fermi level is near the valence band, acting\nas compensating donor. While, for Cd-rich growth conditions, our results\nsuggest that p-type doping is limited by the formation of\n(P$_\\text{Te}$-V$_\\text{Te}$) complexes.\n", "  A manifestation of electron-hole pairing in nonlinear electromagnetic\nresponse of a double layer graphene system is studied. It is shown that the\npairing causes the appearance of a number of peaks in the frequency dependence\nof the intensity of the third harmonic generation (THG). The highest peak\ncorresponds to \\hbar\\omega = (2/3)\\Delta, where \\omega\\ is the incident wave\nfrequency, and \\Delta\\ is the order parameter of the electron-hole pairing. The\nabsolute value of the THG intensity in the systems with electron-hole pairing\nis in several orders of magnitude greater than the THG intensity in the\nunpaired state. It is shown that huge enhancement of the THG intensity occurs\nboth in the double monolayer and double bilayer graphene systems.\n", "  We consider antiparallel Wilson lines in N=4 super Yang-Mills in the presence\nof a codimension-1 defect. We compute the Wilson lines' expectation value both\nat weak coupling, in the gauge theory, and at strong coupling, by finding the\nstring configurations which are dual to this operator. These configurations\ndisplay a Gross-Ooguri transition between a connected, U-shaped string phase\nand a phase in which the string breaks into two disconnected surfaces. We\nanalyze in detail the critical configurations separating the two phases and\ncompare the string result with the gauge theory one in a certain double scaling\nlimit.\n", "  Morphology evolution and coarsening of metal nanoislands is computed within\nthe framework of a surface diffusion-type model that includes the effects of\nthe electron energy confinement within the film, the charge spillage at the\nfilm/substrate interface, the energy anisotropy of the film surface and the\nsurface stress. The conditions that result in large islands with flat tops,\nsteep edges, and strongly preferred heights are determined. A strong influence\nof the film height on the coarsening dynamics and final morphologies is found;\nthe conditions leading to interrupted coarsening are highlighted. The\ndependence of the geometric parameters of the equilibrium island on the film\nheight and on the island initial volume is computed.\n", "  Band structure, Fermi surface, and phonon dispersions of noncentrosymmetric\nB20-type RhGe are calculated ab initio for the first time and their evolution\nwith increasing pressure is investigated. We consider in detail\nsymmetry-conditioned features of the band structure, as well as\npressure-induced changes in the Fermi surface topology, which are expected to\naffect the thermopower of RhGe. We also report on special calculations of\nelectric field gradients on the Rh and Ge nuclei and compare these results with\na very recent 111 Cd-TDPAC study of B20-RhGe.\n", "  New boron subnitride B50N2 has been synthesized by crystallization from the\nB-BN melt at 5 GPa, and its structure has been refined using Rietveld analysis.\nB50N2 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P-4n2 with unit cell\nparameters a = 8.8181(2) A and c = 5.0427(10) A. Quasi-hydrostatic compression\nof two boron subnitrides, B50N2 and B13N2, has been studied to 30 GPa at room\ntemperature in a diamond-anvil cell using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. No\npressure-induced phase transitions have been observed. A fit of experimental\np-V data to the Murnaghan equation of state yielded B50N2 and B13N2 bulk moduli\nof 167(2) and 205(2) GPa, respectively, with fixed first bulk modulus pressure\nderivative of 4.0.\n", "  Real and complex Clifford bundles and Dirac operators defined on them are\nconsidered. By using the index theorems of Dirac operators, table of\ntopological invariants is constructed from the Clifford chessboard. Through the\nrelations between K-theory groups, Grothendieck groups and symmetric spaces,\nthe periodic table of topological insulators and superconductors is obtained.\nThis gives the result that the periodic table of real and complex topological\nphases is originated from the Clifford chessboard and index theorems.\n", "  The routinely flaring events from \\sgras\\ trace dynamic, high-energy\nprocesses in the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole. We\nstatistically study temporal and spectral properties, as well as fluence and\nduration distributions, of the flares detected by the \\chandra\\ X-ray\nObservatory from 1999 to 2012. The detection incompleteness and bias are\ncarefully accounted for in determining these distributions. We find that the\nfluence distribution can be well characterized by a power-law with a slope of\n$1.73^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$, while the durations ($\\tau$ in seconds) by a log-normal\nfunction with a mean $\\log(\\tau)=3.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$ and an intrinsic\ndispersion $\\sigma=0.28^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$. No significant correlation between\nthe fluence and duration is detected. The apparent positive correlation, as\nreported previously, is mainly due to the detection bias (i.e., weak flares can\nbe detected only when their durations are short). These results indicate that\nthe simple self-organized criticality model has difficulties in explaining\nthese flares. We further find that bright flares usually have asymmetric\nlightcurves with no statistically evident difference/preference between the\nrising and decaying phases in terms of their spectral/timing properties. Our\nspectral analysis shows that although a power-law model with a photon index of\n$2.0\\pm0.4$ gives a satisfactory fit to the joint spectra of strong and weak\nflares, there is weak evidence for a softer spectrum of weaker flares. This\nwork demonstrates the potential to use statistical properties of X-ray flares\nto probe their trigger and emission mechanisms, as well as the radiation\npropagation around the black hole.\n", "  We propose in this paper a new approach to the Kaluza-Klein idea of a five\ndimensional space-time unifying gravitation and electromagnetism, and extension\nto higher-dimensional space-time. By considering a natural geometric definition\nof a matter fluid and abandoning the usual requirement of a Ricci-flat five\ndimensional space-time, we show that a unified geometrical frame can be set for\ngravitation and electromagnetism, giving, by projection on the classical\n4-dimensional space-time, the known Einstein-Maxwell-Lorentz equations for\ncharged fluids. Thus, although not introducing new physics, we get a very\naesthetic presentation of classical physics in the spirit of general\nrelativity. The usual physical concepts, such as mass, energy, charge,\ntrajectory, Maxwell-Lorentz law, are shown to be only various aspects of the\ngeometry, for example curvature, of space-time considered as a Lorentzian\nmanifold; that is no physical objects are introduced in space-time, no laws are\ngiven, everything is only geometry.\n  We then extend these ideas to more than 5 dimensions, by considering\nspacetime as a generalization of a $(S^1\\times W)$-fiber bundle, that we named\nmulti-fibers bundle, where $S^1$ is the circle and $W$ a compact manifold. We\nwill use this geometric structure as a possible way to model or encode\ndeviations from standard 4-dimensional General Relativity, or \"dark\" effects\nsuch as dark matter or energy.\n", "  We argue that in the case of identical particles the most natural\nidentification of separability, that is of absence of non-classical\ncorrelations, is via the factorization of mean values of commuting observables.\nIt thus follows that separability and entanglement depend both on the state and\non the choice of observables and are not absolute notions. We compare this\npoint of view with a recent novel approach to the entanglement of identical\nparticles, which allows for the definition of an entanglement entropy from a\nsuitably defined reduced particle density matrix, without the need of labeling\nthe system constituents. We contrast this figure of merit with the\naforementioned lack of an absolute notion of entanglement by considering few\nparadigmatic examples.\n", "  Wikipedia is the largest existing knowledge repository that is growing on a\ngenuine crowdsourcing support. While the English Wikipedia is the most\nextensive and the most researched one with over five million articles,\ncomparatively little is known about the behavior and growth of the remaining\n283 smaller Wikipedias, the smallest of which, Afar, has only one article. Here\nwe use a subset of this data, consisting of 14962 different articles, each of\nwhich exists in 26 different languages, from Arabic to Ukrainian. We study the\ngrowth of Wikipedias in these languages over a time span of 15 years. We show\nthat, while an average article follows a random path from one language to\nanother, there exist six well-defined clusters of Wikipedias that share common\ngrowth patterns. The make-up of these clusters is remarkably robust against the\nmethod used for their determination, as we verify via four different clustering\nmethods. Interestingly, the identified Wikipedia clusters have little\ncorrelation with language families and groups. Rather, the growth of Wikipedia\nacross different languages is governed by different factors, ranging from\nsimilarities in culture to information literacy.\n", "  The Fedoriuk-Maslov catastrophe theory of caustics and turning points is\nextended to solve the bifurcation problems by the improved stationary phase\nmethod (ISPM). The trace formulas for the radial power-law (RPL) potentials are\npresented by the ISPM based on the second- and third-order expansion of the\nclassical action near the stationary point. A considerable enhancement of\ncontributions of the two orbits (pair of consisting of the parent and newborn\norbits) at their bifurcation is shown. The ISPM trace formula is proposed for a\nsimple bifurcation scenario of Hamiltonian systems with continuous symmetries,\nwhere the contributions of the bifurcating parent orbits vanish upon\napproaching the bifurcation point due to the reduction of the end-point\nmanifold. This occurs since the contribution of the parent orbits is included\nin the term corresponding to the family of the newborn daughter orbits. Taking\nthis feature into account, the ISPM level densities calculated for the RPL\npotential model are shown to be in good agreement with the quantum results at\nthe bifurcations and asymptotically far from the bifurcation points.\n", "  In this thesis we present detailed analyses on various running vacuum models\n(RVM's), in which the vacuum energy density \"runs\" with the cosmic expansion.\nThe RVM's are motivated from the renormalization group formalism of Quantum\nField Theory in curved spacetime. In this theoretical framework, the vacuum\nenergy density depends explicitly on the Hubble function and its time\nderivative and thus does not remain constant, in contradistinction to the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM picture. Upon studying how these models fit the data, we\ncan determine whether this dynamical behavior is favored by observations or\nnot. Is the vacuum energy density (or more generically, the DE density)\ndynamical? One of the main conclusions of this dissertation is that we have\nindeed strong evidences in favor of the variability of the DE density\nthroughout the cosmic history. It is shown that this variation can also be\ntraced through other (purely phenomenological) dynamical vacuum models,\ntogether with different parametrizations of the DE (as the XCDM and CPL), and\nscalar field models as the Peebles-Ratra one. The statistical confidence level\nof these evidences reaches in some cases the 3-4$\\sigma$ c.l., something that\nis unprecedented in the literature. An exhaustive explanation of the reasons\nwhy large collaborations as BOSS, Planck and DES have not been able to detect\nsuch signal in favor of the DE dynamics is provided in this thesis too.\n", "  The lanthanide orthoborates, $Ln$BO$_3$, $Ln$ = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb\ncrystallise in a monoclinic structure with the magnetic $Ln^{3+}$ forming an\nedge-sharing triangular lattice. The triangles are scalene, however all\ndeviations from the ideal equilateral geometry are less than 1.5%. The bulk\nmagnetic properties are studied using magnetic susceptibility, specific heat\nand isothermal magnetisation measurements. Heat capacity measurements show\nordering features at $T \\leq$ 2 K for $Ln$ = Gd, Tb, Dy, Er. No ordering is\nobserved for YbBO$_3$ at $T \\geq$ 0.4 K and HoBO$_3$ is proposed to have a\nnon-magnetic singlet state. Isothermal magnetisation measurements indicate\nisotropic Gd$^{3+}$ spins and strong single-ion anisotropy for the other\n$Ln^{3+}$. The change in magnetic entropy has been evaluated to determine the\nmagnetocaloric effect in these materials. GdBO$_3$ and DyBO$_3$ are found to be\ncompetitive magnetocaloric materials in the liquid helium temperature regime.\n", "  The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of the\nheterostructures consisting of single crystalline LaMnO$_3$ samples with\ndifferent crystallographic orientations covered by the epitaxial ferroelectric\nBa$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$TiO$_3$ film has been studied. Results obtained for the\nheterostructure have been compared with the electrical resistivity of the\nsingle crystalline LaMnO$_3$ without the film. It was found that for the\nsamples with the films where the polarization axis is perpendicular to the\ncrystal surface the electrical resistivity strongly decreases, and at the\ntemperature below ~160 K undergoes the insulator-metal transition. Ab-initio\ncalculations were also performed for the structural and electronic properties\nof the BaTiO$_3$/LaMnO$_3$ heterostructure. Transition to the 2D electron gas\nat the interface is shown.\n", "  In the last years, medical computer simulation has seen a great growth in\nseveral scientific branches, from modelling to numerical methods, going through\ncomputer science. The main goals of this incipient discipline are testing\nhypotheses before an intervention, or see what effect could have a drug in the\nsystem before actually taking it, among others. In this work we deduce from the\nmost basic physical principles a one dimensional model for the simulation of\nblood flow in elastic arteries. We will provide some historical background, as\nwell as a brief state of the art of these models. We will also study from a\ncalculus point of view the equations of the model obtained, achieving an\noriginal result for the formation of shock waves in compliant vessels.\nAfterwards we will make some numerical simulations using Galerkin Discontinuous\nFinite Element Method. Since this is actually a family of methods, we will\nmotivate and detail the elections and the implementation strategies.\n", "  Thermal emission spectra of exoplanets provide constraints on the chemical\ncompositions, pressure-temperature (P-T) profiles, and energy transport in\nexoplanetary atmospheres. Accurate inferences of these properties rely on the\nrobustness of the atmospheric retrieval methods employed. While extant\nretrieval codes have provided significant constraints on molecular abundances\nand temperature profiles in several exoplanetary atmospheres, the constraints\non their deviations from thermal and chemical equilibria have yet to be fully\nexplored. Our present work is a step in this direction. We report HyDRA, a\ndisequilibrium retrieval framework for thermal emission spectra of exoplanetary\natmospheres. The retrieval code uses the standard architecture of a parametric\natmospheric model coupled with Bayesian statistical inference using the Nested\nSampling algorithm. For a given dataset, the retrieved compositions and P-T\nprofiles are used in tandem with the GENESIS self-consistent atmospheric model\nto constrain layer-by-layer deviations from chemical and radiative-convective\nequilibrium in the observable atmosphere. We demonstrate HyDRA on the Hot\nJupiter WASP-43b with a high-precision emission spectrum. We retrieve an H2O\nmixing ratio of log(H2O) = -3.54^{+0.82}_{-0.52}, consistent with previous\nstudies. We detect H2O and a combined CO/CO2 at 8-sigma significance. We find\nthe dayside P-T profile to be consistent with radiative-convective equilibrium\nwithin the 1-sigma limits and with low day-night redistribution, consistent\nwith previous studies. The derived compositions are also consistent with\nthermochemical equilibrium for the corresponding distribution of P-T profiles.\nIn the era of high precision and high resolution emission spectroscopy, HyDRA\nprovides a path to retrieve disequilibrium phenomena in exoplanetary\natmospheres.\n", "  Employing a Keldysh-Eilenberger technique, we theoretically study the\ngeneration of a sponta- neous supercurrent and the appearance of the ${\\phi}$0\nphase shift parallel to uniformly in-plane mag- netized superconducting\ninterfaces made of the surface states of a three-dimensional topological\ninsulator. We consider two weakly coupled uniformly magnetized superconducting\nsurfaces where a macroscopic phase difference between the s-wave\nsuperconductors can be controlled externally. We find that, depending on the\nmagnetization strength and orientation on each side, a spontaneous supercurrent\ndue to the ${\\phi}$0-states flows parallel to the interface at the junction\nlocation. Our calcula- tions demonstrate that nonsinusoidal phase relations of\ncurrent components with opposite directions result in maximal spontaneous\nsupercurrent at phase differences close to ${\\pi}$. We also study the An- dreev\nsubgap channels at the interface and show that the spin-momentum locking\nphenomenon in the surface states can be uncovered through density of states\nstudies. We finally discuss realistic experimental implications of our\nfindings.\n", "  In this work, we study the stability of the expanding configurations for\nradiation gaseous stars. Such expanding configurations exist for the isentropic\nmodel and the thermodynamic model. In particular, we focus on the effect of the\nmonatomic gas viscosity tensor on the expanding configurations. With respect to\nsmall perturbation, it is shown the self-similarly expanding homogeneous\nsolutions of the isentropic model is unstable, while the linearly expanding\nhomogeneous solutions of the isentropic model and the thermodynamic model are\nstable. This is an extensive study of the result in arXiv:1605.08083 by Hadzic\nand Jang.\n", "  The goal of this \"Habilitation \\`a diriger des recherches\" is to present two\ndifferent applications, namely computations of certain partition functions in\nprobability and applications to integrable systems, of the topological\nrecursion developed by B. Eynard and N. Orantin in 2007. Since its creation,\nthe range of applications of the topological recursion has been growing and\nmany results in different fields have been obtained. The first aspect that I\nwill develop deals with the historical domain of the topological recursion:\nrandom matrix integrals. I will review the formalism of the topological\nrecursion as well as how it can be used to obtain asymptotic $\\frac{1}{N}$\nseries expansion of various matrix integrals. In particular, a key feature of\nthe topological recursion is that it can recover from the leading order of the\nasymptotic all sub-leading orders with elementary computations. This method is\nparticularly well known and fruitful in the case of hermitian matrix integrals,\nbut I will also show that the general method can be used to cover integrals\nwith hard edges, integrals over unitary matrices and much more. In the end, I\nwill also briefly mention the generalization to $\\beta$-ensembles. In a second\nchapter, I will review the connection between the topological recursion and the\nstudy of integrable systems having a Lax pair representation. Most of the\nresults presented there will be illustrated by the case of the famous six\nPainlev\\'e equations. Though the formalism used in this chapter may look\ncompletely disconnected from the previous one, it is well known that the local\nstatistics of eigenvalues in random matrix theory exhibit a universality\nphenomenon and that the encountered universal systems are precisely driven by\nsome solutions of the Painlev\\'{e} equations. As I will show, the connection\ncan be made very explicit with the topological recursion formalism.\n", "  Roughly 40% of the Earth's total heat flow is powered by radioactive decays\nin the crust and mantle. Geo-neutrinos produced by these decays provide\nimportant clues about the origin, formation and thermal evolution of our\nplanet, as well as the composition of its interior. Previous measurements of\ngeo-neutrinos have all relied on the detection of inverse beta decay reactions,\nwhich are insensitive to the contribution from potassium and do not provide\nmodel-independent information about the spatial distribution of geo-neutrino\nsources within the Earth. Here we present a method for measuring previously\nunresolved components of Earth's radiogenic heating using neutrino-electron\nelastic scattering and low-background, direction-sensitive tracking detectors.\nWe calculate the exposures needed to probe various contributions to the total\ngeo-neutrino flux, specifically those associated to potassium, the mantle and\nthe core. The measurements proposed here chart a course for pioneering\nexploration of the veiled inner workings of the Earth.\n", "  Dark Matter constitutes most of the matter in the presently accepted\ncosmological model for our Universe. The extreme conditions of ordinary\nbaryonic matter, namely high density and compactness, in Neutron Stars make\nthese objects suitable to gravitationally accrete such a massive component\nprovided interaction strength between both, luminous and dark sectors, at\ncurrent experimental level of sensitivity. We consider several different DM\nphenomenological models from the myriad of those presently allowed. In this\ncontribution we review astrophysical aspects of interest in the interplay of\nordinary matter and a fermionic light Dark Matter component. We focus in the\ninterior nuclear medium in the core and external layers, i.e. the crust,\ndiscussing the impact of a novel dark sector in relevant stellar quantities for\n(heat) energy transport such as thermal conductivity or emissivities.\n", "  We conducted high-sensitivity, high-velocity resolution CO(1-0) observations\nin a region containing a portion of the diffuse molecular cloud MBM 53 to\ndetermine whether weak CO emission was present. The results of our observations\nincrease the amount of CO-detectable molecular gas in the region by a factor of\ntwo. The increased molecular mass for the cloud, if applicable to the molecular\nclouds in the entire Pegasus-Pisces region, decreases the dark molecular gas\ncontent from 58% of the total H2 mass to ~ 30%. If the results for MBM53 are\napplicable to other diffuse clouds, then the fraction of dark gas directly\ndetectable via sensitive CO(1-0) observations in diffuse molecular clouds is\nsimilar to that predicted by models for Giant Molecular Clouds.\n", "  In many astrophysical systems, smoothly-varying large-scale variations\ncoexist with small-scale fluctuations. For example, a large-scale velocity or\ndensity gradient can exist in molecular clouds that exhibit small-scale\nturbulence. In redshifted 21cm observations, we also have two types of signals\n- the Galactic foreground emissions that change smoothly and the redshifted\n21cm signals that change fast in frequency space. Sometimes the large-scale\nvariations make it difficult to extract information on small-scale\nfluctuations. We propose a simple technique to remove smoothly varying\nlarge-scale variations. Our technique relies on multi-point structure functions\nand can obtain the magnitudes of small-scale fluctuations. It can also help us\nto filter out large-scale variations and retrieve small-scale maps. We discuss\napplications of our technique to astrophysical observations.\n", "  Advances in techniques for monitoring pH in complex fluids could have\nsignificant impact on analytical and biomedical applications ranging from water\nquality assessment to in vivo diagnostics. We developed flexible graphene\nmicroelectrodes (GEs) for rapid (< 5 seconds), very low power (femtowatt)\ndetection of the pH of complex biofluids. The method is based on real-time\nmeasurement of Faradaic charge transfer between the GE and a solution at zero\nelectrical bias. For an idealized sample of phosphate buffer solution (PBS),\nthe Faradaic current varied monotonically and systematically with the pH with\nresolution of ~0.2 pH unit. The current-pH dependence was well described by a\nhybrid analytical-computational model where the electric double layer derives\nfrom an intrinsic, pH-independent (positive) charge associated with the\ngraphene-water interface and ionizable (negative) charged groups described by\nthe Langmuir-Freundlich adsorption isotherm. We also tested the GEs in more\ncomplex bio-solutions. In the case of a ferritin solution, the relative\nFaradaic current, defined as the difference between the measured current\nresponse and a baseline response due to PBS, showed a strong signal associated\nwith the disassembly of the ferritin and the release of ferric ions at pH ~\n2.0. For samples of human serum, the Faradaic current showed a reproducible\nrapid (<20s) response to pH. By combining the Faradaic current and real time\ncurrent variation, the methodology is potentially suitable for use to detect\ntumor-induced changes in extracellular pH.\n", "  Lipid bilayers composed of non-alpha hydroxy sphingosine ceramide (CER NS),\ncholesterol (CHOL), and free fatty acids (FFA), which are components of the\nhuman skin barrier, are studied via molecular dynamics simulations. Since\nmixtures of these lipids exist in dense gel phases with little molecular\nmobility at physiological conditions, care must be taken to ensure that the\nsimulations become decorrelated from the initial conditions. Thus, we propose\nand validate an equilibration protocol based on simulated tempering in which\nthe simulation takes a random walk through temperature space, allowing the\nsystem to break out of metastable configurations and hence become decorrelated\nform its initial configuration. After validating the equilibration protocol,\nthe effects of the lipid composition and ceramide tail length on bilayer\nproperties are studied. Systems containing pure CER NS, CER NS + CHOL, and CER\nNS + CHOL + FFA, with the CER fatty acid tail length varied within each CER\nNS-CHOL-FFA composition, are simulated. The bilayer thickness is found to\ndepend on the structure of the center of the bilayer, which arises as a result\nof the tail length asymmetry between the lipids studied. The hydrogen bonding\nbetween the lipid headgroups and with water is found to change with the overall\nlipid composition, but is mostly independent of the CER fatty acid tail length.\nSubtle differences in the lateral packing of the lipid tails are also found as\na function of CER tail length. Overall, these results provide insight into the\nexperimentally observed trend of altered barrier properties in skin systems\nwhere there are more ceramides with shorter tails present.\n", "  In this paper, we will analyse a supersymmetric field theory deformed by\ngeneralized uncertainty principle and Lifshitz scaling. It will be observed\nthat this deformed supersymmetric field theory contains non-local fractional\nderivative terms. In order to construct such deformed N=1 supersymmetric\ntheory, a harmonic extension of functions will be used. However, the\nsupersymmetry will be only preserved for a free theory and will be broken by\nthe inclusion of interaction terms.\n", "  I discuss various scenarios for long-lived particles at the LHC that can have\nspectacular signatures, not all of which have been searched for. I take\nmotivation from dark matter and the hierarchy problem, as well as from finding\nnovel signatures. There is also a brief discussion of triggers.\n", "  The Electron-Muon Ranger (EMR) is a fully-active tracking-calorimeter in\ncharge of the electron background rejection downstream of the cooling channel\nat the international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment. It consists of 2832\nplastic scintillator bars segmented in 48 planes in an X-Y arrangement and uses\nparticle range as its main variable to tag muons and discriminate electrons. An\narray of analyses were conducted to characterize the hardware of the EMR and\ndetermine whether the detector performs to specifications. The clear fibres\ncoming from the bars were shown to transmit the desired amount of light, and\nonly four dead channels were identified in the electronics. Two channels had\nindubitably been mismatched during assembly and the DAQ channel map was\nsubsequently corrected. The level of crosstalk is within acceptable values for\nthe type of multi-anode photomultiplier used with an average of\n$0.20\\pm0.03\\,\\%$ probability of occurrence in adjacent channels and a mean\namplitude equivalent to $4.5\\pm0.1\\,\\%$ of the primary signal intensity. The\nefficiency of the signal acquisition, defined as the probability of recording a\nsignal in a plane when a particle goes through it in beam conditions, reached\n$99.73\\pm0.02\\,\\%$.\n", "  The electric field conjugation (EFC) algorithm has shown promise for removing\nscattered starlight from high-contrast imaging measurements, both in numerical\nsimulations and laboratory experiments. To prepare for the deployment of EFC\nusing ground-based telescopes we investigate the response of EFC to unaccounted\nfor deviations from an ideal optical model. We explore the linear nature of the\nalgorithm by assessing its response to a range of inaccuracies in the optical\nmodel generally present in real systems. We find that the algorithm is\nparticularly sensitive to unresponsive deformable mirror (DM) actuators,\nmisalignment of the Lyot stop, and misalignment of the focal plane mask.\nVibrations and DM registration appear to be less of a concern compared to\nvalues expected at the telescope. We quantify how accurately one must model\nthese core coronagraph components to ensure successful EFC corrections. We\nconclude that while the condition of the DM can limit contrast, EFC may still\nbe used to improve the sensitivity of high-contrast imaging observations. Our\nresults have informed the development of a full EFC implementation using the\nProject 1640 coronagraph at Palomar observatory. While focused on a specific\ninstrument our results are applicable to the many coronagraphs that may be\ninterested in employing EFC.\n", "  The functions of RNA pseudoknots (PKs), which are minimal tertiary structural\nmotifs and an integral part of several ribozymes and ribonucleoprotein\ncomplexes, are determined by their structure, stability and dynamics.\nTherefore, it is important to elucidate the general principles governing their\nthermodynamics/folding mechanisms. Here, we combine experiments and simulations\nto examine the folding/unfolding pathways of the VPK pseudoknot, a variant of\nthe Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) PK involved in ribosomal frameshifting.\nFluorescent nucleotide analogs (2-aminopurine and pyrrolocytidine) placed at\ndifferent stem/loop positions in the PK, and laser temperature-jump approaches\nserve as local probes allowing us to monitor the order of assembly of VPK with\ntwo helices with different intrinsic stabilities. The experiments and molecular\nsimulations show that at 50 mM KCl the dominant folding pathway populates only\nthe more stable partially folded hairpin. As the salt concentration is\nincreased a parallel folding pathway emerges, involving the less stable hairpin\nstructure as an alternate intermediate. Notably, the flux between the pathways\nis modulated by the ionic strength. The findings support the principle that the\norder of PK structure formation is determined by the relative stabilities of\nthe hairpins, which can be altered by sequence variations or salt\nconcentrations. Our study not only unambiguously demonstrates that PK folds by\nparallel pathways, but also establishes that quantitative description of RNA\nself-assembly requires a synergistic combination of experiments and\nsimulations.\n", "  Simulating thimble regularization of lattice field theory can be tricky when\nmore than one thimble is to be taken into account. A couple of years ago we\nproposed a solution for this problem. More recently this solution proved to be\neffective in the case of 0+1 dimensional QCD. A few lessons we can learnt,\nincluding the role of symmetries and general hints on algorithmic solutions.\n", "  We analyse the pp elastic scattering amplitudes using the recent LHC data,\nrevisiting the model proposed by A. Martin based on analytic continuation and\ncrossing symmetry. Introducing a new form for the scaling function we show that\nthe data are consistent with the crossing symmetry of the scattering amplitudes\nat $\\sqrt{s}= $ 7 and 8 TeV. The complex amplitude automatically obeys the\nconstraints of dispersion relations and their derivatives. The real part\nreproduces the zero predicted by A. Martin, which is crucial to describe with\nprecision the differential cross section in the forward direction at LHC\nenergies. Since the free parameters of the model are energy independent, the\nanalytical form of the amplitude leads to predictions for higher and asymptotic\nenergies.\n", "  A correlation function in the two-dimensional Liouville field theory\nsatisfies a linear partial differential equation when it involves a degenerate\nfield, due to the decoupling of the null descendant field. According to the\nAlday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa (AGT) correspondence, such a correlation function is\nrelated to the partition function of certain four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsuperconformal quiver gauge theories in the $\\Omega$-background at a special\npoint in the parameter space. Using the non-perturbative Dyson-Schwinger\nequations, we show that the instanton partition function satisfies a\ndifferential equation resulting from the constraints of the gauge field\nconfigurations. We demonstrate that the third order differential equations\nsatisfied by the correlation function in the Liouville field theory with the\nnext-to-simplest degenerate field and by the gauge theory partition function\nwith the corresponding constraint can be identified, thereby confirming the\nmain assertion of the BPS/CFT correspondence.\n", "  The HAWC (High Altitude Water Cerenkov) gamma ray observatory observes muons\nwith nearly-horizontal trajectories corresponding to zenith angles greater than\n$80^{0}$. HAWC is located at an altitude of 4100 meters a.s.l. (70 deg.\natmospheric depth of 2400 g/cm$^{2}$) on the extinct volcano, Sierra Negra in\nMexico. In this poster, we summarize the CORSIKA and GEANT4 as well as\ntoy-model based simulations performed to determine the effective area of HAWC\nto muons from high zenith angle cosmic ray primaries. We are developing an\nupdated GEANT4 based detector response simulation that includes a model of the\nvolcanoes that are located near HAWC. These simulations are investigating the\ncapability to use muon multiplicity and rates to differentiate between the\nprimary particle composition (proton or iron) and measure the primary energy.\n", "  Inspired by moth eyes, nature's most powerful antireflex, we present a\nsub-wavelength SiC micropyramid design, which operates in the Reststrahlen band\nof SiC, namely the spectral band of strong phonon-photon coupling in the SiC\nmaterial. While within this band SiC repels EM waves, we observe here a broad\nlow-reflectivity window with unique attributes, with distinct characteristics\ndifferent from typical dielectric moth-eye-like structures. To be specific,\nwhile the latter systems are entirely symmetric, the reflection response of our\nSiC micropyramid system can be highly asymmetric. In particular, the SiC\nmicropyramid system can be near-reflectionless for light impinging from the tip\nside of the micropyramids and exhibits more than 90% reflection for light\nimpinging from the base side of the micropyramids, over a broad wavelength\nrange in the SiC Reststrahlen band. This strongly asymmetric reflection\nresponse emanates from the cascaded coupling of vortex-like cavity modes at\neach of the SiC blocks comprising the micropyramids and translates into a\nstrongly uni-directional absorber response. We discuss how, by virtue of\nKirchhoff's law, this strongly uni-directional superabsorber behavior implies a\nstrongly uni-directional emission profile that is important for one-way\ninfrared sources and passive radiative-cooling systems.\n", "  Motivating by the discovery of association between GW 170817 and sGRB\n170817A, we present a comprehensive analysis for sGRBs observed with Fermi/GBM\nin 9 operation years and study the properties of sGRB 170817A -like events. We\nderive a catalog of 275 typical sGRBs and 48 sGRB 170817A-like weak events from\nthe GBM data of 2217 GRBs. We visibly identify two patterns of their light\ncurve, single episode (Pattern I, 61\\% of the SGRBs) and multiple episodes\n(Pattern II, 39\\% of the SGRBs). Their duration distribution shows a tentative\nbimodal feature. Their spectra can be fitted with a cutoff power-law model,\nexcept for 4 sGRBs, and the spectral indices normally distribute at\n$\\Gamma=0.69\\pm 0.40$. Their $E_p$ values show a tentative bimodal distribution\nwith peaks at 145 keV and 500 keV. No correlation among $T_{90}$, $E_p$, and\n$\\Gamma$ is found. GRB 170817A is a soft, weak sGRB with $ E_{p}=124\\pm 106$\nkeV, $L_{\\rm iso}=(5.67\\pm4.65)\\times10^{46}\\rm ~erg~s^{-1}$, and $E_{\\rm\niso}=(3.23\\pm2.65)\\times10^{46}\\rm ~erg$. It follows the $E_{\\rm iso}-E_{\\rm\np}$ relation of typical short GRBs. Its lightcurve is of Pattern II. Two\nlightcurve patterns, together with the potential two components in the $E_{\\rm\np}$ and $T_{90}$ distributions, we suspect that the current sample may include\ntwo distinct types of sGRBs from different progenitors. sGRB 170817A-like\nevents may be from NS-NS mergers and those sGRBs with a Pattern I lightcurve\nmay be from another distinct type of compact binary.\n", "  A new two parameter formula for ground-state bands in even-even nuclei, which\nis deduced for soft rotors or transitional nuclei, is proposed. This new\nformula blends those of very soft nuclei and large deformed nuclei.\n", "  Based at a talk given at the Kato Centennial Symposium in Sept. 2017, this\narticle discusses the scientific life and some of the scientific work of T.\nKato.\n", "  Fabrication of atomic scale of metallic wire remains challenging. In present\nwork, a nanoribbon with two parallel symmetric metallic and magnetic edges was\ndesigned from semiconductive monolayer PtS2 by employing first-principles\ncalculations based on density functional theory. Edge energy, bonding charge\ndensity, band structure and simulated STM of possible edges states of PtS2 were\nsystematically studied. It was found that Pt-terminated edge nanoribbons were\nthe relatively stable metallic and magnetic edge tailored from a noble\ntransition metal dichalcogenides PtS2. The nanoribbon with two atomic metallic\nwires may have promising application as nano power transmission lines, which at\nleast two lines are needed.\n", "  Artificial atomic systems in solids are becoming increasingly important\nbuilding blocks in quantum information processing and scalable quantum\nnanophotonic networks. Yet, synthesis of color centers that act as single\nphoton emitters which are suitable for on-chip applications is still beyond\nreach. Here, we report a number of plasma and thermal annealing methods for the\nfabrication of emitters in tape-exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)\ncrystals. A two-step process comprised of Ar plasma etching and subsequent\nannealing in Ar is highly robust, and yields a seven-fold increase in the\nconcentration of emitters in hBN. The initial plasma etching step generates\nemitters that suffer from blinking and bleaching, whereas the two-step process\nyields emitters that are photostable at room temperature and have an emission\nenergy distribution that is red-shifted relative to that of pristine hBN. An\nanalysis of emitters fabricated by a range of plasma and annealing treatments,\ncombined with a theoretical investigation of point defects in hBN indicates\nthat single photon emitters characterized by a high degree of photostability\nand emission wavelengths greater than ~700 nm are associated with defect\ncomplexes that contain oxygen. This is further confirmed by generating the\nemitters by annealing hBN in an oxidative atmosphere. Our findings advance\npresent understanding of the structure of quantum emitter in hBN and enhance\nthe nanofabrication toolkit that is needed to realize integrated quantum\nnanophotonics based on 2D materials.\n", "  We present our preliminary results of the non-perturbative determination of\nthe valence mass dependent coefficients $b_\\mathrm{A}-b_\\mathrm{P}$ and\n$b_\\mathrm{m}$ as well as the ratio $Z_\\mathrm{P} Z_\\mathrm{m}/ Z_\\mathrm{A}$\nentering the flavour non-singlet PCAC relation in lattice QCD with $N_f=3$\ndynamical flavours. We apply the method proposed in the past for quenched\napproximation and $N_f=2$ cases, employing a set of finite-volume ALPHA\nconfigurations with Schr\\\"odinger functional boundary conditions, generated\nwith $O(a)$ improved Wilson fermions and the tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge\naction for a range of couplings relevant for simulations at lattice spacings of\nabout $0.09 \\,$fm and below.\n", "  Optically pumped atomic magnetometers (OPMs) offer highly sensitive magnetic\nmeasurements using compact hardware, offering new possibilities for practical\nprecision sensors. Double-resonance OPM operation is well suited to unshielded\nmagnetometry, due to high sensor dynamic range. However, sensor response is\nhighly anisotropic with variation in the orientation of the magnetic field. We\npresent data quantifying these effects and discuss implications for the design\nof practical sensors.\n", "  In this work, we present for the first time the Lyman $\\alpha$ intensities\nmeasured by Voyager 1/UVS in 2003-2014 (at 90-130 AU from the Sun). During this\nperiod Voyager 1 measured the Lyman $\\alpha$ emission in the outer heliosphere\nat an almost fixed direction close to the upwind (that is towards the\ninterstellar flow). The data show an unexpected behavior in 2003-2009: the\nratio of observed intensity to the solar Lyman $\\alpha$ flux is almost\nconstant. Numerical modelling of these data is performed in the frame of a\nstate-of-art self-consistent kinetic-MHD model of the heliospheric interface\n(Izmodenov & Alexashov, 2015). The model results, for various interstellar\nparameters, predict a monotonic decrease of intensity not seen in the data. We\npropose two possible scenarios that explain the data qualitatively. The first\nis the formation of a dense layer of hydrogen atoms near the heliopause. Such a\nlayer would provide an additional backscattered Doppler shifted Lyman $\\alpha$\nemission, which is not absorbed inside the heliosphere and may be observed by\nVoyager. About 35 R of intensity from the layer is needed. The second scenario\nis an external non-heliospheric Lyman $\\alpha$ component, which could be\ngalactic or extragalactic. Our parametric study shows that $\\sim$25 R of\nadditional emission leads to a good qualitative agreement between the Voyager 1\ndata and the model results.\n", "  By the use of phase perturbation theory we show that if a single realization\nof a one-dimensional randomly rough interface between two dielectric media is\nilluminated at normal incidence from either medium by a broadband Gaussian\nbeam, it produces a scattered field whose differential reflection coefficient\nclosely matches the result produced by averaging the differential reflection\ncoefficient produced by a monochromatic incident beam over the ensemble of\nrealizations of the interface profile function.\n", "  Using gauge/gravity duality methods, we study the relaxation towards\nequilibrium of strongly interacting non-Abelian matter. We adopt boundary\nsourcing to drive the system out-of-equilibrium, and analyze the equilibration\nprocess through local probes (energy density and pressures) and nonlocal probes\n(lengths of the geodesics between two boundary points and extremal surfaces\nhaving a Wilson loop as contour on the boundary). We also investigate the\nreal-time dissociation of the heavy quarkonium in the out-of-equilibrium\nplasma. Systematic comparison with the results of a geometry dual to viscous\nhydrodynamics sheds light on the thermalization process.\n", "  We show that maximal families of mutually unbiased bases are characterized in\nall dimensions by partitioned unitary error bases, up to a choice of a family\nof Hadamards. Furthermore, we give a new construction of partitioned unitary\nerror bases, and thus maximal families of mutually unbiased bases, from a\nfinite field, which is simpler and more direct than previous proposals. We\nintroduce new tensor diagrammatic characterizations of maximal families of\nmutually unbiased bases, partitioned unitary error bases, and finite fields as\nalgebraic structures defined over Hilbert spaces.\n", "  In this work, we study the dynamics of rogue waves in the partially\n$\\cal{PT}$-symmetric nonlocal Davey-Stewartson(DS) systems. Using the Darboux\ntransformation method, general rogue waves in the partially\n$\\cal{PT}$-symmetric nonlocal DS equations are derived. For the partially\n$\\cal{PT}$-symmetric nonlocal DS-I equation, the solutions are obtained and\nexpressed in term of determinants. For the partially $\\cal{PT}$-symmetric DS-II\nequation, the solutions are represented as quasi-Gram determinants. It is shown\nthat the fundamental rogue waves in these two systems are rational solutions\nwhich arises from a constant background at $t\\rightarrow -\\infty$, and develops\nfinite-time singularity on an entire hyperbola in the spatial plane at the\ncritical time. It is also shown that the interaction of several fundamental\nrogue waves is described by the multi rogue waves. And the interaction of\nfundamental rogue waves with dark and anti-dark rational travelling waves\ngenerates the novel hybrid-pattern waves. However, no high-order rogue waves\nare found in this partially $\\cal{PT}$-symmetric nonlocal DS systems. Instead,\nit can produce some high-order travelling waves from the high-order rational\nsolutions.\n", "  We develop a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for function optimization\nthat is particularly useful in the training of neural networks since it makes\nuse of particular aspects of high-dimensional energy landscapes. Due to a\nrecent formulation of semi-supervised learning as an optimization problem, the\nalgorithm can further be used to find the optimal model parameters for deep\ngenerative models. In particular, we present a truncated saddle-free Newton's\nmethod based on recent insight from optimization, analysis of deep neural\nnetworks and random matrix theory. By combining these with the specific quantum\nsubroutines we are able to exhaust quantum computing in order to arrive at a\nnew quantum-classical hybrid algorithm design. Our algorithm is expected to\nperform at least as well as existing classical algorithms while achieving a\npolynomial speedup. The speedup is limited by the required classical read-out.\nOmitting this requirement can in theory lead to an exponential speedup.\n", "  The act of describing how a physical process changes a system is the basis\nfor understanding observed phenomena. For quantum-mechanical processes in\nparticular, the affect of processes on quantum states profoundly advances our\nknowledge of the natural world, from understanding counter-intuitive concepts\nto the development of wholly quantum-mechanical technology. Here, we show that\nquantum-mechanical processes can be quantified using a generic\nclassical-process model through which any classical strategies of mimicry can\nbe ruled out. We demonstrate the success of this formalism using fundamental\nprocesses postulated in quantum mechanics, the dynamics of open quantum\nsystems, quantum-information processing, the fusion of entangled photon pairs,\nand the energy transfer in a photosynthetic pigment-protein complex. Since our\nframework does not depend on any specifics of the states being processed, it\nreveals a new class of correlations in the hierarchy between entanglement and\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and paves the way for the elaboration of a\ngeneric method for quantifying physical processes.\n", "  Let $G$ be an even dimensional, connected, abelian Lie group and\n$(\\mathcal{A}^\\infty,G,\\alpha,\\tau)$ be a $C^*$-dynamical system equipped with\na faithful $G$-invariant trace $\\tau$. We show that whenever it determines a\n$\\varTheta$-summable even spectral triple, $\\mathcal{A}^\\infty$ inherits a\nK\\\"ahler structure. Moreover, there are at least\n$\\prod_{j=1,\\,j\\,odd}^{\\,dim(G)}(dim(G)-j)$ different K\\\"ahler structures. In\nparticular, whenever $\\mathbb{T}^{2k}$ acts ergodically on the algebra, it\ninherits a K\\\"ahler strcture. This gives a class of examples of noncommutative\nK\\\"ahler manifolds. As a corollary, we obtain that all the noncommutative even\ndimensional tori, like their classical counterpart the complex tori, are\nnoncommutative K\\\"ahler manifolds. We explicitly compute the space of complex\ndifferential forms for the noncommutative even dimensional tori and show that\nthe category of holomorphic vector bundle over it is an abelian category. We\nalso explain how the earlier set-up of Polishchuk-Schwarz for the holomorphic\nstructure on noncommutative two-torus follows as a special case of our general\nframework.\n", "  We present the latest ATLAS and CMS measurements of several properties of the\nHiggs boson, such as signal-strength modifiers for the main production modes,\nfiducial and differential cross sections, and the Higgs mass. We have analyzed\nthe 13 TeV proton-proton LHC collision data recorded in 2016, corresponding to\nintegrated luminosities up to $36.1~{\\rm fb}^{-1}$. Results for the ${\\rm H\\to\nZZ}\\to 4\\ell$ (${\\rm \\ell = e\\mu}$), ${\\rm H}\\to\\gamma\\gamma$, and ${\\rm\nH}\\to\\tau\\tau$ decay channels are presented. In addition, searches for new\nphenomena in the ${\\rm H}\\to\\gamma\\gamma + E_{\\rm T}^{\\rm miss}$ and ${\\rm\nH}\\to{\\rm b\\bar{b}} + E_{\\rm T}^{\\rm miss}$ decay channels are presented.\n", "  We report on the status of our calculation of the exclusive semileptonic\ndecay, $B\\rightarrow \\pi \\ell \\nu$; a key process in the determination of the\nCKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$. The M\\\"{o}bius domain wall action is used for\nboth light and heavy quarks on gauge ensembles that include the effects of\n$2+1$ flavours of quarks in the sea at three values of the lattice spacing:\n$a\\approx 0.08~\\mathrm{fm}$, $a\\approx0.055~\\mathrm{fm}$, and\n$a\\approx0.044~\\mathrm{fm}$. Pion masses go down to $300~\\mathrm{MeV}$ while\nheavy quarks masses are as large as $2.44m_c$. We present preliminary results\nof form factors from this process, showing dependence on momentum transfer,\nlattice spacing, and the heavy quark mass.\n", "  We present the results of a holographic model for heavy vector mesons inside\na plasma at finite temperature and density. The spectral function shows a nice\ndescription of the dissociation of the mesons in the medium, corresponding to\nthe decrease in the height of the peaks as the temperature and (or) the density\nincrease. We consider the case of bottomonium states at finite temperature and\nalso the case of charmonium dissociation at zero temperature but finite\nchemical potential.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the next generation gamma-ray\nobservatory. CTA will incorporate about 100 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov\ntelescopes (IACTs) at a southern site, and about 20 in the north. Previous IACT\nexperiments have used up to five telescopes. Subsequently, the design of a\ngraphical user interface (GUI) for the operator of CTA poses an interesting\nchallenge. In order to create an effective interface, the CTA team is\ncollaborating with experts from the field of Human-Computer Interaction. We\npresent here our GUI prototype. The back-end of the prototype is a Python Web\nserver. It is integrated with the observation execution system of CTA, which is\nbased on the Alma Common Software (ACS). The back-end incorporates a redis\ndatabase, which facilitates synchronization of GUI panels. redis is also used\nto buffer information collected from various software components and databases.\nThe front-end of the prototype is based on Web technology. Communication\nbetween Web server and clients is performed using Web Sockets, where graphics\nare generated with the d3.js Javascript library.\n", "  We present an optimization scheme for the focal plane of a multi-frequency\nCMB B-modes experiment with a fixed number of detectors and apply it to the\nspecific case of LSPE experiment. Optimal focal planes are identified on the\nground of different figures of merit defined in terms of the forecasted\nuncertainty $\\sigma_r$ on the tensor--to-scalar ratio $r$ and the expected map\nvariance from foreground and instrumental noise residuals. We then perform a\nforecast analysis in order to assess the precision achievable in B-modes\nmeasurements.\n", "  Characteristics of the intense ultrafast quazi-monochromatic X-ray source at\n17.4 keV generated by a multi-TW femtosecond Ti:Sa-laser beam ($\\lambda$=800\nnm) tightly focused on a thick molybdenum target are investigated within a wide\nrange of laser pulse peak intensities ($10^{16}$ - $10^{19}$ W/cm$^2$) and\ntemporal contrast ($10^6$ - $10^{10}$). Spatial and absolute\nspectrally-resolved energetic parameters of produced pulsed X ray emission are\nmeasured. Fluxes of Mo K$\\alpha$ line radiation reaching $2\\times 10^9$\nphotons/sr per laser shot and energy conversion efficiency as high as\n$3.2\\times 10^{-5} sr^{-1}$ are obtained at high laser contrast of $>10^9$. The\ninterplay of resonance absorption, vacuum heating and ponderomotive (JxB)\nheating mechanisms of the laser-plasma interaction is clearly demonstrated by\ndifferent K$\\alpha$ conversion efficiency dependencies at different laser pulse\nintensity and contrast parameters. The results are confirmed by examining\ndependencies on the laser incidence angle. In the relativistic intensity\nregime, the K$\\alpha$ efficiency shows similar values within the whole examined\nrange of the laser temporal contrast, which varies over 4 orders of magnitude\nresulting in the electron density scale length L of the pre-formed plasma\nchanging from L<<$\\lambda$ to L>$\\lambda$. It confirms the dominant role of the\nJxB mechanism accompanied by the effect of plasma interface steepening under\nlaser radiation pressure in the relativistic interaction regime.\n", "  Applications that envisage utilizing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) at\nthe single photon level assume that the OAM degrees of freedom that the photons\ninherit from the classical wave solutions are orthogonal. To test this critical\nassumption, we quantize the beam-like solutions of the vector Helmholtz\nequation from first principles to delineate its elementary quantum mechanical\ndegrees of freedom. We show that although the beam-photon operators do not in\ngeneral satisfy the canonical commutation relations, implying that the photon\nstates they create are not orthogonal, the states are nevertheless bona fide\neigenstates of the number and Hamiltonian operators. The explicit\nrepresentation for the photon operators presented in this work forms a natural\nbasis to study light-matter interactions and quantum information processing at\nthe single photon level.\n", "  Exploiting photonic high-dimensional entanglement allows one to expand the\nbandwidth of quantum communication and information processing protocols through\nincreased photon information capacity. However, the characterization of\nentanglement in higher dimensions is experimentally challenging because the\nnumber of measurements required scales unfavourably with dimension. While\nbounds can be used to certify high-dimensional entanglement, they do not\nquantify the degree to which quantum states are entangled. Here, we propose a\nquantitative measure that is both an entanglement measure and a dimension\nwitness, which we coin the P-concurrence. We derive this measure by requiring\nentanglement to extend to qubit subspaces that constitute the high-dimensional\nstate. The computation of the P-concurrence is not contingent on reconstructing\nthe full density matrix, and requires less measurements compared to standard\nquantum state tomography by orders of magnitude. This allows for faster and\nmore efficient characterization of high-dimensional quantum states.\n", "  We propose an experimental setup to study collision-induced soliton\namplification. In an optical fibre with anomalous dispersion ($\\beta_2 < 0$),\nwe replace a small region of the fibre with a normal dispersion fibre ($\\beta_2\n> 0$). We show that solitons colliding in this region are able to exchange\nenergy. Depending on the relative phase of the soliton pair, we find that the\nenergy transfer can lead to an energy gain in excess of $20\\%$ for each\ncollision. A sequence of such events can be used to enhance the energy gain\neven further, allowing the possibility of considerable soliton amplification.\nThis energy transfer does not require a third order dispersion or Raman term.\n", "  The critical region of the hierarchical reference theory (HRT) is\ninvestigated further. This extends an earlier work by us where the critical\nproperties of the HRT were concluded indirectly via another accurate but\nsomewhat different theory, the self-consistent Ornstein-Zernike approximation\n(SCOZA), and numerical work. In the present work we perform our analysis\ndirectly upon the HRT partial differential equation to establish ordinary\ndifferential equations for the subleading scaling contributions. Again we find\nthat the HRT critical indices in three dimensions are simple rational numbers.\n", "  The spin-orbit coupled lattice system under Zeeman fields provides an ideal\nplatform to realize exotic pairing states. Notable examples range from the\ntopological superfluid/superconducting (tSC) state, which is gapped in the bulk\nbut metallic at the edge, to the Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state (having a\nphase-modulated order parameter with a uniform amplitude) and the\nLarkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) state (having a spatially varying order parameter\namplitude). Here, we show that the topological FF state with Chern number\n($\\mathcal{C}=-1$) (tFF$_{1}$) and topological LO state with $\\mathcal{C}=2$\n(tLO$_{2}$) can be stabilized in Rashba spin-orbit coupled lattice systems in\nthe presence of both in-plane and out-of-plane Zeeman fields. Besides the\ninhomogeneous tSC states, in the presence of a weak in-plane Zeeman field, two\ntopological BCS phases may emerge with $\\mathcal{C}=-1$ (tBCS$_{1}$) far from\nhalf filling and $\\mathcal{C}=2$(tBCS$_{2}$) near half filling. We show\nintriguing effects such as different spatial profiles of order parameters for\nFF and LO states, the topological evolution among inhomogeneous tSC states, and\ndifferent non-trivial Chern numbers for the tFF$_{1}$ and tLO$_{1,2}$ states,\nwhich are peculiar to the lattice system. Global phase diagrams for various\ntopological phases are presented for both half-filling and doped cases. The\nedge states as well as local density of states spectra are calculated for tSC\nstates in a 2D strip.\n", "  Photonics sensing has long been valued for its tolerance to harsh\nenvironments where traditional sensing technologies fail. As photonic\ncomponents continue to evolve and find new applications, their tolerance to\nradiation is emerging as an important line of inquiry. Here we report on our\ninvestigation of the impact of gamma-ray exposure on the temperature response\nof fiber Bragg gratings. At 25 degrees C, exposures leading to an accumulated\ndose of up to 600 kGy result in complex dose-dependent drift in Bragg\nwavelength, significantly increasing the uncertainty in temperature\nmeasurements obtained if appreciable dose is delivered over the measurement\ninterval. We note that temperature sensitivity is not severely impacted by the\nintegrated dose, suggesting such devices could be used to measure relative\nchanges in temperature.\n", "  We investigate the feasibility of activating coherent mechanical oscillations\nin lasing microspheres by modulating the laser emission at a mechanical\neigenfrequency. To this aim, 1.5% Nd3+:Barium-Titanium-Silicate microspheres\nwith diameters around 50 {\\mu}m were used as high quality factor (Q>10^6)\nwhispering gallery mode lasing cavities. We have implemented a pump-and-probe\ntechnique in which the pump laser used to excite the Nd3+ ions is focused on a\nsingle microsphere with a microscope objective and a probe laser excites a\nspecific optical mode with the evanescent field of a tapered fibre. The studied\nmicrospheres show monomode and multi-mode lasing action, which can be modulated\nin the best case up to 10 MHz. We have optically transduced thermally-activated\nmechanical eigenmodes appearing in the 50-70 MHz range, the frequency of which\ndecreases with increasing the size of the microspheres. In a pump-and-probe\nconfiguration we observed modulation of the probe signal up to the maximum pump\nmodulation frequency of our experimental setup, i.e., 20 MHz. This modulation\ndecreases with frequency and is unrelated to lasing emission, pump scattering\nor thermal effects. We associate this effect to free-carrier-dispersion induced\nby multiphoton pump light absorption. On the other hand, we conclude that, in\nour current experimental conditions, it was not possible to resonantly excite\nthe mechanical modes. Finally, we discuss on how to overcome these limitations\nby increasing the modulation frequency of the lasing emission and decreasing\nthe frequency of the mechanical eigenmodes displaying a strong degree of\noptomechanical coupling.\n", "  The present paper studies the effects of thermal radiation and mass diffusion\non MHD flow over a vertical plate that applies time dependent shear to the\nfluid. This study is meant to provide framework for improved thermal system\nwhere induced automated shear on chemical (fluid) will in- crease velocity of\nfluid and hence enhances the smooth flow. This study will also throw light on\nan important aspect of controlling temperature of thermal system in the context\nof emitting thermal radiation. Exact expressions for velocity field,\ntemperature and mass concentration corresponding to the radiative flow of\nviscous fluid have been calculated. These expressions are obtained by using\nLaplace transform of corresponding fractional differential equations. The\nexpressions of temperature and mass concentration of fluid have been presented\nin series form. However, velocity field is presented in the form of integral\nsolutions. All exact expressions satisfy initial and boundary conditions. Some\nsignificant limiting cases of fluid parameters and of fractional parameters\nhave been discussed. Two special cases of shear stress; shear stress in the\nform of Heaviside function and oscillating shear stress have also been taken\ninto account to compare the behavior of fluid motion graphically. An analysis\nhas also been prepared to compare analytical and numerical solutions for\nconcentration of fluid using numerical algorithm. Validity of analytical\nsolutions up to a certain order of accuracy has been es- tablished.\n", "  We survey some recent work on topological quantum computation with gapped\nboundaries and boundary defects and list some open problems.\n", "  The Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation $\\psi\"(x)+\\kappa^2 \\psi(x)=0$ where\n$\\kappa^2=k^2-V(x)$ is rewritten as a more popular form of a second order\ndifferential equation through taking a similarity transformation\n$\\psi(z)=\\phi(z)u(z)$ with $z=z(x)$. The Schr\\\"{o}dinger invariant $I_{S}(x)$\ncan be calculated directly by the Schwarzian derivative $\\{z, x\\}$ and the\ninvariant $I(z)$ of the differential equation $u_{zz}+f(z)u_{z}+g(z)u=0$. We\nfind an important relation for moving particle as $\\nabla^2=-I_{S}(x)$ and thus\nexplain the reason why the Schr\\\"{o}dinger invariant $I_{S}(x)$ keeps constant.\nAs an illustration, we take the typical Heun differential equation as an object\nto construct a class of soluble potentials and generalize the previous results\nthrough choosing different $\\rho=z'(x)$ as before. We get a more general\nsolution $z(x)$ through integrating\n$(z')^2=\\alpha_{1}z^2+\\beta_{1}z+\\gamma_{1}$ directly and it includes all\npossibilities for those parameters. Some particular cases are discussed in\ndetail.\n", "  The strength of the spin-orbit interaction relevant to transport in a low\ndimensional structure depends critically on the relative geometrical\narrangement of current carrying orbitals. Recent tight-binding orbital models\nfor spin transport in DNA-like molecules, have surmised that the band\nspin-orbit coupling arises from the particular angular relations between\norbitals of neighboring bases on the helical chain. Such arrangement could be\nprobed by inducing deformations in the molecule in a conductive probe AFM type\nsetup, as it was recently reported by Kiran, Cohen and Naaman\\cite{Kiran}. Here\nwe report deformation dependent spin selectivity when a double strand DNA model\nis compressed or stretched. We find that the equilibrium geometry is not\noptimal with respect to the SO coupling strength and thus spin selectivity can\nbe tuned by deformations. The latter can be increased by stretching the helical\nstructure taking into account its elastic properties through the Poisson ratio.\nThe spin filtering gap is also found to be tunable with uniaxial deformations.\n", "  A partial differential equation (PDE) was developed to describe\ntime-dependent ligand-receptor interactions for applications in biosensing\nusing field effect transistors (FET). The model describes biochemical\ninteractions at the sensor surface (or biochemical gate) located at the bottom\nof a solution-well, which result in a time-dependent change in the FET\nconductance. It was shown that one can exploit the disparate length scales of\nthe solution-well and biochemical gate to reduce the coupled PDE model to a\nsingle nonlinear integrodifferential equation (IDE) that describes the\nconcentration of reacting species. Although this equation has a convolution\nintegral with a singular kernel, a numerical approximation was constructed by\napplying the method of lines. The need for specialized quadrature techniques\nwas obviated and numerical evidence strongly suggests that this method achieves\nfirst-order accuracy. Results reveal a depletion region on the biochemical\ngate, which non-uniformly alters the surface potential of the semiconductor.\n", "  The new generation of laser facilities is expected to deliver short (10 fs -\n100 fs) laser pulses with 10 - 100 PW of peak power. This opens an opportunity\nto study matter at extreme intensities in the laboratory and provides access to\nnew physics. Here we propose to scatter GeV-class electron beams from\nlaser-plasma accelerators with a multi-PW laser at normal incidence. In this\nconfiguration, one can both create and accelerate electron-positron pairs. The\nnew particles are generated in the laser focus and gain relativistic momentum\nin the direction of laser propagation. Short focal length is an advantage, as\nit allows the particles to be ejected from the focal region with a net energy\ngain in vacuum. Electron-positron beams obtained in this setup have a low\ndivergence, are quasi-neutral and spatially separated from the initial electron\nbeam. The pairs attain multi-GeV energies which are not limited by the maximum\nenergy of the initial electron beam. We present an analytical model for the\nexpected energy cutoff, supported by 2D and 3D particle-in-cell simulations.\nThe experimental implications, such as the sensitivity to temporal\nsynchronisation and laser duration is assessed to provide guidance for the\nfuture experiments.\n", "  Hubertus J. J. van Dam [Phys. Rev. A 93, 052512, 2016] claims that the\none-particle reduced density matrix (1RDM) of an interacting system can be\nrepresented by means of a single-determinant wavefunction of fictitious\nnon-interacting particles. van Dam introduced orbitals within a mean-field\nframework that produce energy levels similar to Hartree-Fock (HF) orbital\nenergies, therefore he also claims that conventional analyses based on Koopmans\ntheorem are possible in 1RDM functional theory (1RDMFT). In this comment, we\ndemonstrate that both claims are unfounded.\n", "  Semidiurnal atmospheric thermal tides are important for terrestrial\nexoplanets in the habitable zone of their host stars. With solid tides, they\ntorque these planets, thus contributing to determine their rotation states as\nwell as their climate. Given the complex dynamics of thermal tides, analytical\nmodels are essential to understand its dependence on the structure and rotation\nof planetary atmospheres and the tidal frequency. In this context, the state of\nthe art model proposed in the 60's by Lindzen and Chapman explains well the\nproperties of thermal tides in the asymptotic regime of Earth-like rapid\nrotators but predicts a non-physical diverging tidal torque in the vicinity of\nthe spin-orbit synchronization. In this work, we present a new model that\naddresses this issue by taking into account dissipative processes through a\nNewtonian cooling. First, we recover the tidal torque recently obtained with\nnumerical simulations using General Circulation Models (GCM). Second, we show\nthat the tidal response is very sensitive to the atmospheric structure,\nparticularly to the stability with respect to convection. A strong stable\nstratification is able to annihilate the atmospheric tidal torque, leading to\nsynchronization, while a convective atmosphere will be submitted to a strong\ntorque, leading to a non-synchronized rotation state.\n", "  The approach in which the electron and positron are treated as ordinary,\ndifferent particles, each being characterized by the complete set of the Dirac\nplane waves, is examined. This completely symmetric representation that is\nbeyond the standard QED, makes it necessary to choose another solution of the\nDirac equation for the free particle propagator as compared to that used\ncurrently. The Bethe-Salpeter equation with these particle propagators is\nstudied in the ladder approximation. A new branch of the massless composite\nbosons formed by the coupled electron-positron pairs with the coupling equal to\nthe fine structure constant, has been found. It has been obtained that: 1) the\nmassless bosons have the normalized complex wave functions, which are\ntransversely compressed plane waves; 2) the transverse radius of the wave\nfunctions diverges as the boson energy goes to zero that is, the composite\nbosons cannot be at rest; 3) the extension of the transverse wave function in\nthe momentum space and the compression of the coordinate wave function are\ncontinuously occurred with increasing the boson energy. The reaction\n$e^{-}e^{+}\\to B\\gamma\\gamma$ products of which are the massless composite\nboson and two photons, is investigated. The cross-section of this reaction is\nderived for the non-relativistic colliding beams of the spin-polarized\nelectrons and positrons. In this case the $2\\gamma$ angular correlation\nspectrum is characterized by a narrow peak with the full-width-at-half-maximum\nnot exceeding 0.2 mrad. It is shown that to establish whether there is the\nconventional annihilation of singlet electron-positron pair with the two-photon\nemission or the investigated reaction, products of which are the three\nparticles, experiments with the extremely non-relativistic colliding beams\nshould be conducted.\n", "  A set of equations is derived describing the macroscopic transport of\nparticles and energy in a thermonuclear plasma on the energy confinement time.\nThe equations thus derived allow studying collisional and turbulent transport\nself-consistently, retaining the effect of magnetic field geometry without\npostulating any scale separation between the reference state and fluctuations.\nPreviously, assuming scale separation, transport equations have been derived\nfrom kinetic equations by means of multiple-scale perturbation analysis and\nspatio-temporal averaging. In this work, the evolution equations for the\nmoments of the distribution function are obtained following the standard\napproach; meanwhile, gyrokinetic theory has been used to explicitly express the\nfluctuation induced fluxes. In this way, equations for the transport of\nparticles and energy up to the transport time scale can be derived using\nstandard first order gyrokinetics.\n", "  Generative models for graphs are increasingly becoming a popular tool for\nresearchers to generate realistic approximations of graphs. While in the past,\nfocus was on generating graphs which follow general laws, such as the power law\nfor degree distribution, current models have the ability to learn from observed\ngraphs and generate synthetic approximations. The primary emphasis of existing\nmodels has been to closely match different properties of a single observed\ngraph. Such models, though stochastic, tend to generate samples which do not\nhave significant variance in terms of the various graph properties. We argue\nthat in many cases real graphs are sampled drawn from a graph population (e.g.,\nnetworks sampled at various time points, social networks for individual\nschools, healthcare networks for different geographic regions, etc.). Such\npopulations typically exhibit significant variance. However, existing models\nare not designed to model this variance, which could lead to issues such as\noverfitting. We propose a graph generative model that focuses on matching the\nproperties of real graphs and the natural variance expected for the\ncorresponding population. The proposed model adopts a mixture-model strategy to\nexpand the expressiveness of Kronecker product based graph models (KPGM), while\nbuilding upon the two strengths of KPGM, viz., ability to model several key\nproperties of graphs and to scale to massive graph sizes using its elegant\nfractal growth based formulation. The proposed model, called x-Kronecker\nProduct Graph Model, or xKPGM, allows scalable learning from observed graphs\nand generates samples that match the mean and variance of several salient graph\nproperties. We experimentally demonstrate the capability of the proposed model\nto capture the inherent variability in real world graphs on a variety of\npublicly available graph data sets.\n", "  The Landauer expression for computing current-voltage characteristics in\nnanoscale devices is efficient and widely applicable but not suited to\ntransient phenomena and time dependent currents because it assumes that the\ncharge carrier population attains a time independent dynamic equilibrium as\nsoon as the external voltage is turned on. In this article, we construct a very\ngeneral expression for a time dependent current in an\nelectrode-molecule-electrode arrangement. Utilizing a model Hamiltonian, we\npropagate the Schrodinger wave function equation to numerically compute the\ntime dependent population in the individual sub-systems. The current in each\nelectrode (defined in terms of the rate of change of the corresponding\npopulation) has two components, one due to the charges originating from the\nsame electrode and the other due to the charges initially residing at the other\nelectrode. We derive an analytical expression for the first component and\nillustrate that it agrees reasonably with the numerical counterpart at early\ntimes. The structural form reveals that the initial occupancy can be factored\nout of the time dependent segment of the expression. We take this cue to\nconstruct a Landauer style formula and demonstrate that the current obtained\nfrom this simplified formula overlaps with our most general numerical current\nonly after the charge flow settles into a steady state. Thus, we illustrate the\nemergence of Landauer transport from a true first-principles quantum dynamics\ncalculation without any prior assumptions. Subsequently, we investigate the\ningredients in our model that regulate the onset time scale of this Landauer\nregime. We compare the performance of our general current expression with the\nLandauer current for time dependent electronic coupling. Finally, we comment on\nthe applicability of the Landauer formulas to compute hot-electron current\narising upon plasmon decoherence.\n", "  Team C2CNT, or team Carbon dioxide to carbon nanotubes, proprietary\ntechnology directly removes the widest range of carbon dioxide from the\necosystem. C2CNT technology simply transforms low to high carbon dioxide into\ncarbon and oxygen, and the carbon produced is permanently removed, that is\nstable on the order of geologic time frames. C2CNT technology directly removes,\ntransforms and stores atmospheric 0.04% CO2 without pre-concentration from the\nair, or 5% CO2 removal of gas power plant CO2 emissions, or 12.5% CO2 removal\nof coal power plant CO2 emissions, or 33% CO2 (pertinent to the complete\nremoval of CO2 from cement production plants, or directly removes, transforms\nand stores 100% CO2.\n", "  We present a new method for probing the hadronic interaction models at\nultra-high energy and extracting details about mass composition. This is done\nusing the time profiles of the signals recorded with the water-Cherenkov\ndetectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The profiles arise from a mix of the\nmuon and electromagnetic components of air-showers. Using the risetimes of the\nrecorded signals we define a new parameter, which we use to compare our\nobservations with predictions from simulations. We find, firstly,\ninconsistencies between our data and predictions over a greater energy range\nand with substantially more events than in previous studies. Secondly, by\ncalibrating the new parameter with fluorescence measurements from observations\nmade at the Auger Observatory, we can infer the depth of shower maximum for a\nsample of over 81,000 events extending from 0.3 EeV to over 100 EeV. Above 30\nEeV, the sample is nearly fourteen times larger than currently available from\nfluorescence measurements and extending the covered energy range by half a\ndecade. The energy dependence of the average depth of shower maximum is\ncompared to simulations and interpreted in terms of the mean of the logarithmic\nmass. We find good agreement with previous work and extend the measurement of\nthe mean depth of shower maximum to greater energies than before, reducing\nsignificantly the statistical uncertainty associated with the inferences about\nmass composition.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a mathematical definition of a new ``numerical\ninvariants\" of Calabi--Yau 3-folds from stable sheaves of dimension one, which\nis motivated by the Gopakumar-Vafa conjecture in M-theory. Moreover, we show\nthat for any projective morphism $f:X -> Y$ of normal projective varieties,\nthere exists a natural $sl_2 \\times sl_2$ action on the intersection cohomology\ngroup $IH(X, \\Q)$ which fits into the perverse Leray spectral sequence.\n", "  It is well known that the sixth Painlev\\'e equation $\\PVI$ admits a group of\nB\\\"acklund transformations which is isomorphic to the affine Weyl group of type\n$\\mathrm{D}_4^{(1)}$. Although various aspects of this unexpectedly large\nsymmetry have been discussed by many authors, there still remains a basic\nproblem yet to be considered, that is, the problem of characterizing the\nB\\\"acklund transformations in terms of Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. In this\ndirection, we show that the B\\\"acklund transformations are just the pull-back\nof very simple transformations on the moduli of monodromy representations by\nthe Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. This result gives a natural and clear\npicture of the B\\\"acklund transformations. Key words: B\\\"acklund\ntransformation, the sixth Painlev\\'e equation, Riemann-Hilbert correspondence,\nisomonodromic deformation, affine Weyl group of type $\\mathrm{D}_4^{(1)}$.\n", "  In this paper, we will give a complete geometric background for the geometry\nof Painlev\\'e $VI$ and Garnier equations. By geometric invariant theory, we\nwill construct a smooth coarse moduli space $M_n^{\\balpha}(\\bt, \\blambda, L) $\nof stable parabolic connection on $\\BP^1$ with logarithmic poles at $D(\\bt) =\nt_1 + ... + t_n$ as well as its natural compactification. Moreover the moduli\nspace $\\cR(\\cP_{n, \\bt})_{\\ba}$ of Jordan equivalence classes of\n$SL_2(\\C)$-representations of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(\\BP^1 \\setminus\nD(\\bt),\\ast)$ are defined as the categorical quotient. We define the\nRiemann-Hilbert correspondence $\\RH: M_n^{\\balpha}(\\bt, \\blambda, L) \\lra\n\\cR(\\cP_{n, \\bt})_{\\ba}$ and prove that $\\RH$ is a bimeromorphic proper\nsurjective analytic map. Painlev\\'e and Garnier equations can be derived from\nthe isomonodromic flows and Painlev\\'e property of these equations are easily\nderived from the properties of $\\RH$. We also prove that the smooth parts of\nboth moduli spaces have natural symplectic structures and $\\RH$ is a symplectic\nresolution of singularities of $\\cR(\\cP_{n, \\bt})_{\\ba}$, from which one can\ngive geometric backgrounds for other interesting phenomena, like Hamiltonian\nstructures, B\\\"acklund transformations, special solutions of these equations.\n"]}
