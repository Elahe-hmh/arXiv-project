"None"], "abstract": ["  We explore short-distance static correlation functions in the infinite XXZ\nchain using previously derived formulae which represent the correlation\nfunctions in factorized form. We compute two-point functions ranging over 2, 3\nand 4 lattice sites as functions of the temperature and the magnetic field in\nthe massive regime $\\Delta>1$, extending our previous results to the full\nparameter plane of the antiferromagnetic chain ($\\Delta > -1$ and arbitrary\nfield $h$). The factorized formulae are numerically efficient and allow for\ntaking the isotropic limit ($\\Delta = 1$) and the Ising limit ($\\Delta =\n\\infty$). At the critical field separating the fully polarized phase from the\nN\\'eel phase, the Ising chain possesses exponentially many ground states. The\nresidual entropy is lifted by quantum fluctuations for large but finite\n$\\Delta$ inducing unexpected crossover phenomena in the correlations.\n", "  The XXZ quantum spin chain has a triple point in its ground state\n$h$-$1/\\Delta$ phase diagram. This first order critical point is located at the\njoint end point of the two second order phase transition lines marking the\ntransition from the gapless phase to the fully polarized phase and to the\nN\\'eel ordered phase, respectively. We explore the magnetization and the\nshort-range correlation functions in its vicinity using the exact solution of\nthe model. In the critical regime above the triple point we observe a strong\nvariation of all physical quantities on a low energy scale of order $1/\\Delta$\ninduced by the transversal quantum fluctuations. We interpret this phenomenon\nstarting from a strong-coupling perturbation theory about the highly degenerate\nground state of the Ising chain at the triple point. From the perturbation\ntheory we identify the relevant scaling of the magnetic field and of the\ntemperature. Applying the scaling to the exact solutions we obtain explicit\nformulae for the magnetization and short-range correlation functions at low\ntemperatures.\n", "  We introduce an approach to study certain singular PDEs which is based on\ntechniques from paradifferential calculus and on ideas from the theory of\ncontrolled rough paths. We illustrate its applicability on some model problems\nlike differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion, a fractional\nBurgers type SPDE driven by space-time white noise, and a non-linear version of\nthe parabolic Anderson model with a white noise potential.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the action of a localized dissipative potential\non a macroscopic matter wave, which we implement by shining an electron beam on\nan atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). We measure the losses induced by the\ndissipative potential as a function of the dissipation strength observing a\nparadoxical behavior when the strength of the dissipation exceeds a critical\nlimit: for an increase of the dissipation rate the number of atoms lost from\nthe BEC becomes lower. We repeat the experiment for different parameters of the\nelectron beam and we compare our results with a simple theoretical model,\nfinding excellent agreement. By monitoring the dynamics induced by the\ndissipative defect we identify the mechanisms which are responsible for the\nobserved paradoxical behavior. We finally demonstrate the link between our\ndissipative dynamics and the measurement of the density distribution of the BEC\nallowing for a generalized definition of the Zeno effect. Due to the high\ndegree of control on every parameter, our system is a promising candidate for\nthe engineering of fully governable open quantum systems.\n", "  In this paper a possibility to accelerated the expansion of the large scale\nuniverse due to interacting varying Chaplygin gas of a specific form and a\ntachyonic matter is considered. A specific form of the potential and\nappropriate values of the parameters allow to obtain early tachyonic dark\nmatter with $\\omega_{T} \\approx 0$ in recent Universe as well. On the other\nhand, related to the structure of the field equations describing the dynamics\nof the background we assumed the form of non-gravitational interaction to be\ngiven in advance. A sing changeable interaction between dark energy and dark\nmatter is also included due to a huge interest towards it in recent literature.\nPossible future finite time singularities for cansidered models have been\ndetermined to finalize the paper. The study shows that in case of\nnon-interacting model, the fate of the Universe will be either Type II~(The\nSudden Singularity), or Type IV~(Generalized Sudden Singularity) singularity.\nOn the other hand, the consideration of $Q=3 b H \\rho_{de}$ non-gravitational\ninteraction in addition to Type II and Type IV singularities will induce also\nType V~($\\omega$-singularity) singularity. Whilst in the model with $Q=3 b q H\n\\rho_{de}$ non-gravitational interaction only Type IV singularity will be\nobserved. Moreover, $2$ forms of the scale factor has been considered\nseparately allowing analytically obtain the behavior of the cosmological\nparameters without specifying an explicit form of the potential for tachyonic\nmatter.\n", "  We have experimentally studied the multiple side-band generation for\ntwo-frequency components injected into a tapered amplifier and demonstrated its\neffects on atomic laser cooling. A heterodyne frequency-beat measurement and a\nFabry Perot interferometer have been applied to analyze the side-band\ngeneration with different experimental parameters, such as frequency\ndifference, injection laser power and tapered amplifier current. In laser\ncooling potassium40 and potassium41 with hyperfine splitting of 1.3GHz and\n254MHz, respectively, the side-band generation with a small frequency\ndifference has a significant effect on the number of trapped atoms.\n", "  In this paper we treat the multiparticle hopping asymmetric diffusion model\n(MADM) of which initial configuration is such that a single site is occupied by\ninfinitely many particles and all other sites are empty. We show that the\nprobability distribution of the $m^{\\textrm{th}}$ leftmost particle's position\nat time $t$ is represented by a Fredholm determinant. Also, we consider an\nexclusion process type model of the MADM, which is the (two-sided) PushASEP.\nFor the PushASEP with the step Bernoulli initial condition, we find a Fredholm\ndeterminant representation of the probability distribution of the\n$m^{\\textrm{th}}$ leftmost particle's position at $t$.\n", "  Stochastic electrodynamics is a classical theory which assumes that the\nphysical vacuum consists of classical stochastic fields with average energy\n$\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\omega$ in each mode, i.e., the zero-point Planck spectrum.\nWhile this classical theory explains many quantum phenomena related to harmonic\noscillator problems, hard results on nonlinear systems are still lacking. In\nthis work the hydrogen ground state is studied by numerically solving the\nAbraham -- Lorentz equation in the dipole approximation. First the stochastic\nGaussian field is represented by a sum over Gaussian frequency components, next\nthe dynamics is solved numerically using OpenCL. The approach improves on work\nby Cole and Zou 2003 by treating the full $3d$ problem and reaching longer\nsimulation times. The results are compared with a conjecture for the ground\nstate phase space density. Though short time results suggest a trend towards\nconfirmation, in all attempted modelings the atom ionises at longer times.\n", "  Trapping lithium with a big number in a simplified experimental setup has\ndifficulties and challenges today. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate\nthe enhancement of \\textsuperscript{6}Li trapping efficiency in a\nthree-dimensional magneto-optical trap (3D MOT) by using the multiple-sideband\ncooling in a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D MOT). To improve the\nnumber of trapped atoms, we broaden the cooling light spectrum to 102 MHz\ncomposed of seven frequency components and then trap atoms with a number of\n$6.0\\times10^8$ which is about 4 times compared to that in the single-frequency\ncooling. The capture velocity and dependence of atomic number on the laser\ndetuning have been analyzed, where the experimental result has a good agreement\nwith the theoretical prediction based on a simple two-level model. We also\nanalyze the loss rate of alkali metals due to fine-structure exchanging\ncollisions and find that the multiple-sideband cooling is special valid for\nlithium.\n", "  SNIA and CMB datasets have shown both of evolving Newton's \"constant\" and a\nsignature of the coupling of scalar field to matter. These observations\nmotivate the consideration of the scalar-matter coupling in Jordan frame in the\nframework of scalar-tensor gravity. So far, majority of the works on the\ncoupling of scalar matter has performed in Einstein frame in the framework of\nminimally coupled scalar fields. In this work, we generalize the original\nscalar-tensor theories of gravity introducing a direct coupling of scalar to\nmatter in the Jordan frame. The combined consideration of both evolving\nNewton's constant and scalar-matter coupling using the recent observation\ndatasets, shows features different from the previous works. The analysis shows\na vivid signature of the scalar-matter coupling. The variation rate of the\nNewton's constant is obtained rather greater than that determined in the\nprevious works.\n", "  We develop a theory to teleport an unknown quantum state using entanglement\nbetween two distant parties. Our theory takes into account experimental\nlimitations due to contribution of multi-photon pair production of parametric\ndown conversion source, inefficiency and dark counts of detectors and channel\nlosses. We use a linear optics setup for quantum teleportation of an unknown\nquantum state by performing Bell state measurement by the sender. Our theory\nsuccessfully provides a model for experimentalists to optimize the fidelity by\nadjusting the experimental parameters. We apply our model to a recent\nexperiment on quantum teleportation and the results obtained by our model are\nin good agreement with the experiment results.\n", "  We derive exact and asymptotic results for random partitions from general\nresults in the semi-classical analysis of coherent states applied to the\nclassical periodic Benjamin-Ono equation at critical regularity $s= -1/2$. We\nfind classical $dF_{\\star |v} (c| \\overline{\\varepsilon})$ and quantum\n$d\\hat{F}^{\\eta_{NS}}( c | \\hbar, \\overline{\\varepsilon})|_{\\Psi}$ conserved\ndensities for this system with dispersion coefficient $\\overline{\\varepsilon}$\nextending Nazarov-Sklyanin (2013). For quantum stationary states, this\nconserved density is $dF_{\\lambda}(c | \\varepsilon_2, \\varepsilon_1)$ the\nRayleigh measure of the profile of a partition $\\lambda$ of anisotropy\n$(\\varepsilon_2, \\varepsilon_1) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2$ for $\\hbar = - \\varepsilon_1\n\\varepsilon_2$, $\\overline{\\varepsilon}= \\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_2$\ninvariant under $\\varepsilon_2 \\longleftrightarrow \\varepsilon_1$. As Jack\npolynomials are the quantum stationary states and Stanley's Cauchy kernel\n(1989) is the reproducing kernel, the random values of the quantum periodic\nBenjamin-Ono hierarchy in a coherent state $\\Upsilon_v ( \\cdot | \\hbar)$ are a\n\"Jack measure\" on partitions, a dispersive generalization of Okounkov's Schur\nmeasures (1999). By our general results for coherent states, we have\nconcentration on a limit shape as $\\hbar \\rightarrow 0$, the classical\nconserved density at $v$, and quantum fluctuations are an explicit Gaussian\nfield. Our results follow from an enumerative asymptotic expansion in $\\hbar$\nand $\\overline{\\varepsilon}$ of joint cumulants over new combinatorial objects\nwe call \"ribbon paths\". Our results reflect the fact that at fixed $\\hbar>0$\nthe weight defining Fock space is already a fractional Brownian motion of\nvariance $\\hbar$ and Hurst index $(-s) - \\tfrac{1}{2} \\dim \\mathbb{T} = +\n\\tfrac{1}{2} - \\tfrac{1}{2} = 0.$\n", "  Polarization quasiprobability distribution defined in the Stokes space shares\nmany important properties with the Wigner function for the position and\nmomentum. Most notably, they both give correct one-dimensional marginal\nprobability distributions and therefore represent the natural choice for the\nprobability distributions in classical hidden-variable models. In this context,\nnegativity of the Wigner function is considered as a proof of non-classicality\nfor a quantum state. On the contrary, the polarization quasiprobability\ndistribution demonstrates negativity for all quantum states. This feature comes\nfrom the discrete nature of the Stokes variables; however, it was not observed\nin previous experiments, because they were performed with photon-number\naveraging detectors. Here we reconstruct the polarization quasiprobability\ndistribution of a coherent state with photon-number resolving detectors, which\nallows us to directly observe for the first time its negativity.\n", "  Recently Herzog and Mattingly have shown that a $\\mathbb{C}$-valued\npolynomial ODE which admits finite-time blow-up solutions may be stabilized by\nthe addition of $\\mathbb{C}$-valued Brownian noise. In this paper we extend\ntheir problem to a $\\mathbb{C}^2$-valued system of coupled ODEs that also\nadmits finite-time blow-up solutions. We show analytically and numerically that\nstabilization can be achieved in our setting by adding a suitable Brownian\nnoise, and that the resulting system of SDEs is ergodic. The proof uses\nGirsanov theorem to effect a time change from our $\\mathbb{C}^2$-system to a\nquasi-$\\mathbb{C}$-system similar to the one studied by Herzog and Mattingly.\n", "  For the case of quantum loop algebras $\\mathrm U_q(\\mathcal\nL(\\mathfrak{sl}_{l + 1}))$ with $l = 1, 2$ we find the $\\ell$-weights and the\ncorresponding $\\ell$-weight vectors for the representations obtained via\nJimbo's homomorphism, known also as evaluation representations. Then we find\nthe $\\ell$-weights and the $\\ell$-weight vectors for the $q$-oscillator\nrepresentations of Borel subalgebras of the same quantum loop algebras. This\nallows, in particular, to relate $q$-oscillator and prefundamental\nrepresentations.\n", "  In this paper we derive the inverse spatial Laplacian for static, spherically\nsymmetric backgrounds by solving Poisson's equation for a point source. This is\ndifferent from the electrostatic Green function, which is defined on the four\ndimensional static spacetime, while the equation we consider is defined on the\nspatial hypersurface of such spacetimes. This Green function is relevant in the\nHamiltonian dynamics of theories defined on spherically symmetric backgrounds,\nand closed form expressions for the solutions we find are absent in the\nliterature. We derive an expression in terms of elementary functions for the\nSchwarzschild spacetime, and comment on the relation of this solution with the\nknown Green function of the spacetime Laplacian operator. We also find an\nexpression for the Green function on the static pure de Sitter space in terms\nof hypergeometric functions.\n", "  Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) $MX_2$ ($M$ = Ti, Nb, Ta; $X$ = S,\nSe, Te) exhibit a rich set of charge density wave (CDW) orders, which usually\ncoexist and/or compete with superconductivity. The mechanisms of CDWs and\nsuperconductivity in TMDs are still under debate. Here we perform an\ninvestigation on a typical TMD system, 1\\emph{T}-TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_x$ ($0 \\leq x\n\\leq 2$). Doping-induced disordered distribution of Se/Te suppresses CDWs in\n1\\emph{T}-TaSe$_2$. A domelike superconducting phase with the maximum\n$T_\\textrm{c}^{\\textrm{onset}}$ of 2.5 K was observed near CDWs. The\nsuperconducting volume is very small inside the CDW phase and becomes very\nlarge instantly when the CDW phase is fully suppressed. The observations can be\nunderstood based on the strong \\emph{\\textbf{q}}-dependent electron-phonon\ncoupling-induced periodic-lattice-distortion (PLD) mechanism of CDWs. The\nvolume variation of superconductivity implies the emergence of domain walls in\nthe suppressing process of CDWs. Our concluded scenario makes a fundamental\nunderstanding about CDWs and related superconductivity in TMDs.\n", "  The recent advances in single atom detection and manipulation in experiments\nwith ultracold quantum gases are reviewed. The discussion starts with the basic\nprinciples of trapping, cooling and detecting single ions and atoms. The\nrealization of single atom detection in ultracold quantum gases is presented in\ndetail and the employed methods, which are based on light scattering, electron\nscattering, field ionization and direct neutral particle detection are\ndiscussed. The microscopic coherent manipulation of single atoms in a quantum\ngas is also covered. Various examples are given in order to highlight the power\nof these approaches to study many-body quantum systems.\n", "  We revisit the tunneling picture for the Hawking effect in light of the\ncharged Nariai manifold, because this general relativistic solution, which\ndisplays two horizons, provides the bonus to allow the knowledge of exact\nsolutions of the field equations. We first perform a revisitation of the\ntunneling ansatz in the framework of particle creation in external fields a la\nNikishov, which corroborates the interpretation of the semiclassical emission\nrate Gamma as the conditional probability rate for the creation of a couple of\nparticles from the vacuum. Then, particle creation associated with the Hawking\neffect on the Nariai manifold is calculated in two ways. On the one hand, we\napply the Hamilton Jacobi formalism for tunneling, in the case of a charged\nscalar field on the given background. On the other hand, the knowledge of the\nexact solutions for the Klein Gordon equations on Nariai manifold, and their\nanalytic properties on the extended manifold, allow us a direct computation of\nthe flux of particles leaving the horizon, and, as a consequence, we obtain a\nfurther corroboration of the semiclassical tunneling picture from the side of\nS-matrix formalism.\n", "  We show how to compute the spectral function for a scalar theory in two\ndifferent scenarios: one which disregards back-reaction i.e. the response of\nthe environment to the external particle, and the other one where back-reaction\nis considered. The calculation was performed using the Kadanoff-Baym equation\nthrough the Keldysh formalism. When back-reaction is neglected, the spectral\nfunction is equal to the equilibrium one, which can be represented as a\nBreit-Wigner distribution. When back-reaction is introduced we observed a\ndamping in the spectral function of the thermal bath. Such behavior modifies\nthe damping rate for particles created within the bath. This certainly implies\nphenomenological consequences right after the Big-Bang, when the primordial\nbath was created.\n", "  Tackling the low-temperature fate of supercooled liquids is challenging due\nto the immense timescales involved, which prevent equilibration and lead to the\noperational glass transition. Relating glassy behaviour to an underlying,\nthermodynamic phase transition is a long-standing open question in condensed\nmatter physics. Like experiments, computer simulations are limited by the small\ntime window over which a liquid can be equilibrated. Here we address the\nchallenge of low temperature equilibration using trajectory sampling in a\nsystem undergoing a nonequilibrium phase transition. This transition occurs in\ntrajectory space between the normal supercooled liquid and a glassy state rich\nin low-energy geometric motifs. Our results indicate that this transition might\nbecome accessible in equilibrium configurational space at a temperature close\nto the so-called Kauzmann temperature, and provide a possible route to unify\ndynamical and thermodynamical theories of the glass transition.\n", "  The paper presents an analysis of formation mechanism and properties of\nspatial distributions of blue stragglers in evolving globular clusters, based\non numerical simulations done with the MOCCA code. First, there are presented\nN-body and MOCCA simulations which try to reproduce the simulations presented\nby Ferraro (2012). Then, the agreement between N-body and the MOCCA code is\nshown. Finally, we discuss the formation process of the bimodal distribution.\nWe report that so-called bimodal spatial distribution of blue stragglers is a\nvery transient feature. It is formed for one snapshot in time and it can easily\nvanish in the next one. Moreover, we show that the radius of avoidance proposed\nby Ferraro (2012) goes out of sync with the apparent minimum of the bimodal\ndistribution after about two half-mass relaxation times. This finding creates a\nreal challenge for the dynamical clock, which uses this radius to determine the\ndynamical age of globular clusters. Additionally, the paper discusses a few\nimportant problems concerning the apparent visibilities of the bimodal\ndistributions which have to be taken into account while studying the spatial\ndistributions of blue stragglers.\n", "  In this work we investigate the effectiveness of continuous-variable (CV)\nentangled states, transferred through high-loss atmospheric channels, as a\nmeans of viable quantum key distribution (QKD) between terrestrial stations and\nlow-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. In particular, we investigate the role played\nby the Gaussian CV states as compared to non-Gaussian states. We find that\nbeam-wandering induced atmospheric losses lead to QKD performance levels that\nare in general quite different from those found in fixed-attenuation channels.\nFor example, circumstances can be found where no QKD is viable at some fixed\nloss in fiber but is viable at the same mean loss in fading channels. We also\nfind that, in some circumstances, the QKD relative performance of Gaussian and\nnon-Gaussian states can in atmospheric channels be the reverse of that found in\nfixed-attenuation channels. These findings show that the nature of the\natmospheric channel can have a large impact on the QKD performance. Our results\nshould prove useful for emerging global quantum communications that use LEO\nsatellites as communication relays.\n", "  We compare the elemental depletions in the gas phase of the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) with the elemental depletions in the rocky material of our Solar\nSystem. Our analysis finds a high degree of chemical complementarity: elements\ndepleted in the gas phase of the ISM are enriched in the rocky material of our\nSolar System, and vice versa. This chemical complementarity reveals the generic\nconnections between interstellar dust and rocky planetary material. We use an\ninheritance model to explain the formation of primordial grains in the solar\nnebula. The primary dust grains inherited from the ISM, in combination with the\nsecondary ones condensed from the solar nebula, constitute the primordial rocky\nmaterial of our planetary system, from which terrestrial planets are formed\nthrough the effects of the progressive accretion and sublimation. The\nsemi-major-axis-dependence of the chemical composition of rocky planetary\nmaterial is also observed by comparing elemental depletions in the Earth, CI\nchondrites and other types of carbonaceous chondrites.\n", "  We define a conformal reference frame, i.e., a special projection of the\nsix-dimensional sky bundle of a Lorentzian manifold (or the five-dimensional\ntwistor space) to a three-dimensional manifold. We construct an example, a\nconformal compactification, for Minkowski space. Based on the complex structure\non the skies, we define the celestial transform of Lorentzian vectors, a kind\nof spinor correspondence. We express a 1-form generating the contact structure\nexplicitly as a (line bundle)-valued form. We prove a theorem on the projection\nof this 1-form to the fiberwise normal bundle of a reference frame; its\ncorollary is an equation for the flow of time.\n  The Appendix is less mathematical than the main body and discusses the causal\nrelation in context of the FLRW cosmology and its natural conformal reference\nframe.\n", "  It has recently been shown that it is possible to represent the complete\nquantum state of any system as a phase-space quasi-probability distribution\n(Wigner function) [Phys Rev Lett 117, 180401]. Such functions take the form of\nexpectation values of an observable that has a direct analogy to displaced\nparity operators. In this work we give a procedure for the measurement of the\nWigner function that should be applicable to any quantum system. We have\napplied our procedure to IBM's Quantum Experience five-qubit quantum processor\nto demonstrate that we can measure and generate the Wigner functions of two\ndifferent Bell states as well as the five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\n(GHZ) state. As Wigner functions for spin systems are not unique, we define,\ncompare, and contrast two distinct examples. We show how using these Wigner\nfunctions leads to an optimal method for quantum state analysis especially in\nthe situation where specific characteristic features are of particular interest\n(such as for spin Schr\\\"odinger cat states). Furthermore we show that this\nanalysis leads to straightforward, and potentially very efficient, entanglement\ntest and state characterisation methods.\n", "  We present a method to model optical images of galaxies using Expectation\nMaximization Principal Components Analysis (EMPCA). The method relies on the\ndata alone and does not assume any pre-established model or fitting formula. It\npreserves the statistical properties of the sample, minimizing possible biases.\n  The precision of the reconstructions appears to be suited for photometric,\nmorphological and weak lensing analysis, as well as the realization of mock\nastronomical images. Here, we put some emphasis on the latter because weak\ngravitational lensing is entering a new phase in which systematics are becoming\nthe major source of uncertainty. Accurate simulations are necessary to perform\na reliable calibration of the ellipticity measurements on which the final bias\ndepends.\n  As a test case, we process $7038$ galaxies observed with the ACS/WFC stacked\nimages of the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) and measure the accuracy of the\nreconstructions in terms of their moments of brightness, which turn out to be\ncomparable to what can be achieved with well-established weak-lensing\nalgorithms.\n", "  A search is presented for an excess of events with large missing transverse\nmomentum in association with at least one highly energetic jet, in a data\nsample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The\ndata correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns\ncollected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The results are interpreted using a\nset of simplified models for the production of dark matter via a scalar,\npseudoscalar, vector, or axial vector mediator. Additional sensitivity is\nachieved by tagging events consistent with the jets originating from a\nhadronically decaying vector boson. This search uses jet substructure\ntechniques to identify hadronically decaying vector bosons in both\nLorentz-boosted and resolved scenarios. This analysis yields improvements of\n80% in terms of excluded signal cross sections with respect to the previous CMS\nanalysis using the same data set. No significant excess with respect to the\nstandard model expectation is observed and limits are placed on the parameter\nspace of the simplified models. Mediator masses between 80 and 400 GeV in the\nscalar and pseudoscalar models, and up to 1.5 TeV in the vector and axial\nvector models, are excluded.\n", "  A trophallaxis inspired model for distributed transport between randomly\ninteracting agents Trophallaxis, the regurgitation and mouth to mouth transfer\nof liquid food between members of eusocial insect societies, is an important\nprocess that allows the fast and efficient dissemination of food in the colony.\nTrophallactic systems are typically treated as a network of agent interactions.\nThis approach, though valuable, does not easily lend itself to analytic\npredictions. In this work we consider a simple trophallactic system of randomly\ninteracting agents with finite carrying capacity, and calculate analytically\nand via a series of simulations the global food intake rate for the whole\ncolony as well as observables describing how uniformly the food is distributed\nwithin the nest. Our work serves as a stepping stone to describing the\ncollective properties of more complex trophallactic systems, such as those\nincluding division of labor between foragers and workers.\n", "  As with entanglement, different forms of Bell nonlocality arise in the\nmultipartite scenario. These can be defined in terms of relaxations of the\ncausal assumptions in local hidden-variable theories. However, a\ncharacterisation of all the forms of multipartite nonlocality has until now\nbeen out of reach, mainly due to the complexity of generic multipartite causal\nmodels. Here, we employ the formalism of Bayesian networks to reveal\nconnections among different causal structures that make a both practical and\nphysically meaningful classification possible. Our framework holds for\narbitrarily many parties. We apply it to study the tripartite scenario in\ndetail, where we fully characterize all the nonlocality classes. Remarkably, we\nidentify new highly nonlocal causal structures that cannot reproduce all\nquantum correlations. This shows, to our knowledge, the strongest form of\nquantum multipartite nonlocality known to date. Finally, as a by-product\nresult, we derive a non-trivial Bell-type inequality with no quantum violation.\nOur findings constitute a significant step forward in the understanding of\nmultipartite Bell nonlocality and open several venues for future research.\n", "  Superconducting proximity effect (SPE) in topological insulator (TI) and\nsuperconductor (SC) hybrid structure has attracted intense attention in recent\nyears in an effort to search for mysterious Majorana fermions (MFs) in\ncondensed matter systems. Here we report on the SPE in a Bi2Se3/NbSe2 junction\nfabricated with an all-dry transfer method. Resulting from the highly\ntransparent interface, two sharp resistance drops are observed at 7 K and 2 K,\nrespectively, corresponding to the superconducting transition of NbSe2 flake\nand the SPE induced superconductivity in Bi2Se3 flake. Experimentally measured\ndifferential conductance spectra exhibit a bias-independent conductance plateau\n(BICP) in the vicinity of zero bias below 7 K. As temperatures further decrease\na zero bias conductance peak (ZBCP) emerges from the plateau and becomes more\nenhanced and sharpened at lower temperatures. Our numerically simulated\ndifferential conductance spectra reproduce the observed BICP and ZBCP and show\nthat the SPE in topological surface states (TSS) is much stronger than that in\nthe bulk states of Bi2Se3. The SPE induced superconducting gap for the TSS of\nBi2Se3 is comparable to that of NbSe2 and gives rise to the observed BICP below\n7 K. In contrast, the SPE induced superconducting gap for the bulk states of\nBi2Se3 is an order of magnitude smaller than that of NbSe2 and superconducting\nTSS. These weakly paired bulk states in Bi2Se3 give rise to the ZBCP below 2 K.\nOur study has clearly unveiled the different roles of TSS and bulk stats in\nSPE, clarified the physical origin of the SPE induced features, and shined\nlight on further investigation of SPE and MF in TI/SC hybrid structures.\n", "  We report on the transition between an Anderson localized regime and a\nconductive regime in a 1D scattering system with correlated disorder. We show\nexperimentally that when long-range correlations, in the form of a power-law\nspectral density with power larger than 2, are introduced the localization\nlength becomes much bigger than the sample size and the transmission peaks\ntypical of an Anderson localized system merge into a pass band. As other forms\nof long-range correlations are known to have the opposite effect, i.e. to\nenhance localization, our results show that care is needed when discussing the\neffects of correlations, as different kinds of long-range correlations can give\nrise to very different behavior.\n", "  Hybrid percolation transitions (HPTs) induced by cascading processes have\nbeen observed in diverse complex systems such as $k$-core percolation,\nbreakdown on interdependent networks and cooperative epidemic spreading models.\nMuch effort has been devoted to describe the properties of HPTs of individual\nsystems. Yet the fundamental question about the possible universal mechanism\nunderlying those HPTs has not been investigated at a microscopic level. Here,\nwe find that the discontinuity in the order parameter in such HPTs results from\ntwo steps: a durable critical branching (CB) and an explosive, supercritical\n(SC) process. In a random network of $N$ nodes at the transition the CB process\npersists for $O(N^{1/3})$ time and the remaining nodes become vulnerable. Those\nvulnerable nodes are activated then in the short SC process. This crossover\nmechanism and scaling behavior are universal for different HPT systems.\n", "  We calculate the equation of state after inflation and provide an upper bound\non the duration before radiation domination by taking the nonlinear dynamics of\nthe fragmented inflaton field into account. A broad class of single-field\ninflationary models with observationally consistent flattening of the potential\nat a scale $M$ away from the origin, $V(\\phi)\\propto |\\phi|^{2n}$ near the\norigin, and where the couplings to other fields are ignored are included in our\nanalysis. We find that the equation of state parameter $w\\rightarrow 0$ for\n$n=1$ and $w\\rightarrow 1/3$ (after sufficient time) for $n\\gtrsim 1$. We\ncalculate how the number of $e$-folds to radiation domination depends on both\n$n$ and $M$ when $M\\sim m_{\\rm pl}$, whereas when $M\\ll m_{\\rm pl}$, we find\nthat the duration to radiation domination is negligible. Our results are\nexplained in terms of a linear instability analysis in an expanding universe,\nscaling arguments, and are supported by detailed 3+1 dimensional lattice\nsimulations. We show how our work significantly reduces the uncertainty in\ninflationary observables, even after including couplings to additional light\nfields.\n", "  A logical qubit is a two-dimensional subspace of a higher dimensional system,\nchosen such that it is possible to detect and correct the occurrence of certain\nerrors. Manipulation of the encoded information generally requires arbitrary\nand precise control over the entire system. Whether based on multiple physical\nqubits or larger dimensional modes such as oscillators, the individual elements\nin realistic devices will always have residual interactions which must be\naccounted for when designing logical operations. Here we demonstrate a holistic\ncontrol strategy which exploits accurate knowledge of the Hamiltonian to\nmanipulate a coupled oscillator-transmon system. We use this approach to\nrealize high-fidelity (99%, inferred), decoherence-limited operations on a\nlogical qubit encoded in a superconducting cavity resonator using\nfour-component cat states. Our results show the power of applying numerical\ntechniques to control linear oscillators and pave the way for utilizing their\nlarge Hilbert space as a resource in quantum information processing.\n", "  High-energy, carrier-envelope phase (CEP)-stable, sub-cycle, mid-infrared\n(mid-IR) pulses can provide unique opportunities of exploring phase-sensitive\nstrong-field light-matter interactions in atoms, molecules, and solids. In the\nmid-IR wavelength, the ponderomotive energy of laser pulses is dramatically\nincreased (versus the visible/near-infrared) and, therefore, the Keldysh\nparameter is much smaller than unity even at relatively modest laser\nintensities. This enables to study the sub-cycle electron dynamics in solids\nvia high-harmonic generation (HHG) without damage. One can also control the\nelectron emissions from nano-devices in the sub-cycle time scale. These efforts\nare opening a great opportunity towards petahertz electronics. Here, we present\na high-energy, sub-cycle pulse synthesizer based on a mid-IR optical parametric\namplifier (OPA), pumped by CEP-stable, 2.1 um femtosecond pulses, and its\napplication to HHG in solids. The signal and idler combined spectrum spans from\n2.5 to 9.0 um, which covers the whole midwave-infrared (MWIR) region. We\ncoherently synthesize the passively CEP-stable few-cycle signal and idler\npulses to generate 33 uJ, 0.88-cycle (12.4 fs), multi-GW pulses centered at\n~4.2 um, which is further energy scalable. The in-line synthesis of the\nCEP-stable sub-cycle pulse is realized through the type-I collinear OPA with\nminimal temporal walk-off. The MWIR sub-cycle pulse is used for driving HHG in\nthin silicon samples, producing harmonics up to ~19th order with a continuous\nspectral coverage due to the isolated emission by the sub-cycle driver. Our\ndemonstration offers an energy scalable and technically simple platform of\nlaser sources generating CEP-stable sub-cycle pulses in the whole MWIR region\nfor investigating isolated phase-sensitive strong-field interactions in solids\nand gases.\n", "  We propose a new alternative to the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle\n(WIMP) paradigm for dark matter. Rather than being determined by thermal\nfreeze-out, the dark matter abundance in this scenario is set by dark matter\ndecay, which is allowed for a limited amount of time just before the\nelectroweak phase transition. More specifically, we consider fermionic singlet\ndark matter particles coupled weakly to a scalar mediator $S_3$ and to\nauxiliary dark sector fields, charged under the Standard Model gauge groups.\nDark matter freezes out while still relativistic, so its abundance is initially\nvery large. As the Universe cools down, the scalar mediator develops a vacuum\nexpectation value (vev), which breaks the symmetry that stabilises dark matter.\nThis allows dark matter to mix with charged fermions and decay. During this\nepoch, the dark matter abundance is reduced to give the value observed today.\nLater, the SM Higgs field also develops a vev, which feeds back into the $S_3$\npotential and restores the dark sector symmetry. In a concrete model we show\nthat this \"vev flip-flop\" scenario is phenomenologically successful in the most\ninteresting regions of its parameter space. We also comment on detection\nprospects at the LHC and elsewhere.\n", "  The spin connection enters the theory of gravity as a nonabelian gauge field\nassociated with local Lorentz transformations. Normally it is eliminated from\nmaking an extra assumption - that of the metricity of the vierbein field.\nHowever, treated by itself with the usual gauge action, it has a negative beta\nfunction, implying that it is asymptotically free. I suggest that the spin\nconnection could be confined (or perhaps partially confined) in the same way as\nother nonabelian gauge fields. This would remove the need to make the extra\nassumption of metricity, as the spin connection would not be present in the low\nenergy theory, leaving the symmetry to be realized only using metric variables.\n", "  In the description of general covariance, the vierbein and the Lorentz\nconnection can be treated as independent fundamental fields. With the usual\ngauge Lagrangian, the Lorentz connection is characterized by an asymptotically\nfree running coupling. When running from high energy, the coupling gets large\nat a scale which can be called the Planck mass. If the Lorentz connection is\nconfined at that scale, the low energy theory can have the Einstein Lagrangian\ninduced at low energy through dimensional transmutation. However, in general\nthere will be new divergences in such a theory and the Lagrangian basis should\nbe expanded. I construct a conformally invariant model with a larger basis size\nwhich potentially may have the same property.\n", "  We report the first di-jet transverse momentum asymmetry measurements from\nAu+Au and p+p collisions at RHIC. The two highest-energy back-to-back jets\nreconstructed from fragments with transverse momenta above 2 GeV/c display a\nsignificantly stronger momentum imbalance in heavy-ion collisions than in the\np+p reference. When re-examined with correlated soft particles included, we\nobserve that these di-jets then exhibit a unique new feature -- momentum\nbalance is restored to that observed in p+p for a jet resolution parameter of\nR=0.4, while re-balancing is not attained with a smaller value of R=0.2.\n", "  We study the competition between Kondo screening and frustrated magnetism on\nthe non-symmorphic Shastry-Sutherland Kondo lattice at a filling of two\nconduction electrons per unit cell. A previous analysis of this model\nidentified a set of gapless partially Kondo screened phases intermediate\nbetween the Kondo-destroyed paramagnet and the heavy Fermi liquid. Based on\ncrystal symmetries, we argue that (i)~both the paramagnet and the heavy Fermi\nliquid are {\\it semimetals} protected by a glide symmetry; and (ii)~partial\nKondo screening breaks the symmetry, removing this protection and allowing the\npartially-Kondo-screened phase to be deformed into a Kondo insulator via a\nLifshitz transition. We confirm these results using large-$N$ mean field theory\nand then use non-perturbative arguments to derive a generalized Luttinger sum\nrule constraining the phase structure of 2D non-symmorphic Kondo lattices\nbeyond the mean-field limit.\n", "  By monitoring a large number of stars in the Local Group galaxies, we can\ndetect nanolensing events by sub-lunar mass compact objects (SULCOs) such as\nprimordial black holes (PBHs) and rogue (free-floating) dwarf planets in the\nMilky Way halo. In contarst to microlensing by stellar-mass objects, the\nfinite-source size effect becomes important and the lensing time duration\nbecomes shorter ($\\sim 10^{1-4}\\,\\textrm{s}$). Using stars with $V<26$ in M33\nas sources, for one-night observation, we would be able to detect $10^{3-4}$\nnanolensing events caused by SULCOs in the Milky Way halo with a mass of\n$10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$ to $10^{-7}M_{\\odot}$ for sources with S/N$>5$ if SULCOs\nconstitute all the dark matter components. Moreover, we expect $10^{1-2}$\nevents in which bright blue stars with S/N$>100$ are weakly amplified due to\nlensing by SULCOs with a mass range of $10^{-11}M_{\\odot}$ to\n$10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$. Thus the method would open a new window on SULCOs in the\nMilky Way halo that would otherwise not be observable.\n", "  Recent observation of $\\sim$ 10 times higher critical temperature in FeSe\nmonolayer compared with its bulk phase has drawn a great deal of attention\nbecause the electronic structure in the monolayer phase appears to be different\nthan bulk FeSe. Using a combination of density functional theory and dynamical\nmean field theory, we find electronic correlations have important effects on\nthe predicted atomic-scale geometry and the electronic structure of the\nmonolayer FeSe on SrTiO$_3$. The electronic correlations are dominantly\ncontrolled by the Se-Fe-Se angle either in the bulk phase or the monolayer\nphase. But the angle sensitivity increases and the orbital differentiation\ndecreases in the monolayer phase compared to the bulk phase. The correlations\nare more dependent on Hund's J than Hubbard U. The observed orbital selective\nincoherence to coherence crossover with temperature confirms the Hund's\nmetallic nature of the monolayer FeSe. We also find electron doping by oxygen\nvacancies in SrTiO$_3$ increases the correlation strength, especially in the\n$d_{xy}$ orbital by reducing the Se-Fe-Se angle.\n", "  We study the real time evolution of the correlation functions in a globally\nquenched interacting one dimensional lattice system by means of time adaptive\ndensity matrix renormalization group. We find a clear light-cone behavior\nquenching the repulsive interaction from the gapped density wave regime. The\nspreading velocity increases with the final values of the interaction and then\nsaturates at a certain finite value. In the case of a Luttinger liquid phase as\nthe initial state, for strong repulsive interaction quenches, a more complex\ndynamics occurs as a result of bound state formations. From the other side in\nthe attractive regime, depending on where connected correlation functions are\nmeasured, one can observe a delay in the starting time evolution and a\ncoexistence of ballistic and localized signals.\n", "  Positive maps applied to a subsystem of a bipartite quantum state constitute\na central tool in characterising entanglement. In the multipartite case,\nhowever, the direct application of a positive but not completely positive map\ncannot distinguish if a state is genuinely multipartite entangled or just\nentangled across some bipartition. We thus generalise this bipartite concept to\nthe multipartite setting by introducing non-positive maps that are positive on\nthe subset of bi-separable states, but can map to a non-positive element if\napplied to a genuine multipartite entangled state. We explicitly construct\nexamples of multipartite non-positive maps, obtained from positive maps via a\nlifting procedure, that in this fashion can reveal genuine multipartite\nentanglement in a robust way.\n", "  One of the most important concepts in non-equilibrium physics is relaxation.\nIn the vicinity of a classical critical point, the relaxation time can diverge\nand result in a universal power-law for the relaxation dynamics; the emerging\nclassification of the dynamic universality class has been elucidated by\nHohenberg and Halperin. In this paper, we systematically study the long-time\nrelaxation dynamics in stochastically driven interacting quantum systems. We\nfind that even though the stochastic forces will inevitably drive the systems\ninto a featureless infinite temperature state, the way to approach the steady\nstate can be highly nontrivial and exhibit rich universal dynamical behavior\ndetermined by the interplay between the stochastic driving and quantum\nmany-body effects. We investigate the dynamical universality class by including\ndifferent types of perturbations. The heating dynamics of a Hamiltonian with\nlocally unbounded Hilbert space is also studied.\n", "  We study a lattice model comprising four massless reduced staggered fermions\nin four dimensions coupled through an $SU(4)$-invariant four-fermion\ninteraction. We present both theoretical arguments and numerical evidence that\nno bilinear fermion condensates are present for any value of the four-fermi\ncoupling, in contrast to earlier studies of Higgs--Yukawa models with different\nexact lattice symmetries. At strong coupling we observe the formation of a\nfour-fermion condensate and a mass gap in spite of the absence of bilinear\ncondensates. Unlike those previously studied systems we do not find a\nferromagnetic phase separating this strong-coupling phase from the massless\nweak-coupling phase. Instead we observe long-range correlations in a narrow\nregion of the coupling, still with vanishing bilinear condensates. While our\nnumerical results come from relatively small lattice volumes that call for\ncaution in drawing conclusions, if this novel phase structure is verified by\nfuture investigations employing larger volumes it may offer the possibility for\nnew continuum limits for strongly interacting fermions in four dimensions.\n", "  In this work we present the results of our investigation of SU(2) gauge\ntheory with two Dirac fermions in the adjoint representation, also known as\nMinimal Walking Technicolour. We have done numerical lattice simulations of\nthis theory at two different values of the gauge coupling and several fermion\nmasses. Our results include the particle spectrum and the mass anomalous\ndimension. The spectrum contains so far unconsidered states, a fermion-gluon\nstate and flavour singlet mesons. The mass anomalous dimension is determined\nfrom the scaling of the masses and the mode number. The remnant dependence of\nthe universal mass ratios and mass anomalous dimension on the gauge coupling\nindicates the relevance of scaling corrections.\n", "  We investigate the conditional average and the conditional variance of\ndissipated energy considering, as a prototypical example, a driven spin-boson\nsystem. We follow a measurement protocol in which the spin is prepared in a\ncertain initial state before undergoing a periodic driving. Subsequently, the\nspin is projected onto a post-selected final state. We compare the conditional\naverage of dissipated energy to the lower bound which directly follows from the\nwell known fluctuation relations. We further report that a special selection of\nthe initial (pre-selected) and final (post-selected) spin states leads to an\nenhanced energy emission with simultaneous noise suppression at driving times\nof order of the relaxation time.\n", "  Graphene is known as a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal, in which electron\nstates are described by the Dirac equation of relativistic quantum mechanics.\nThree-dimensional analogues of graphene are characterized by Dirac points or\nlines in momentum space, which are protected by symmetry. Here, we report a\nnovel 3D carbon allotrope belonging to a class of topological nodal line\nsemimetals, discovered by using an evolutionary structure search method. The\nnew carbon phase in monoclinic $C$2$/m$ space group, termed $m$-$C_8$, consists\nof five-membered rings with $sp^3$ bonding interconnected by $sp^2$-bonded\ncarbon networks. Enthalpy calculations reveal that $m$-$C_8$ is more favorable\nover recently reported topological semimetallic carbon allotropes, and the\ndynamical stability of $m$-$C_8$ is verified by phonon spectra and molecular\ndynamics simulations. Simulated x-ray diffraction spectra propose that\n$m$-$C_8$ would be one of the unidentified carbon phases observed in detonation\nshoot. The analysis of electronic properties indicates that $m$-$C_8$ exhibits\nthe nodal line protected by both inversion and time-reversal symmetries in the\nabsence of spin-orbit coupling and the surface band connecting the projected\nnodal points. Our results may help design new carbon allotropes with exotic\nelectronic properties.\n", "  The spinor-vector duality was discovered in free fermionic constructions of\nthe heterotic-string in four dimensions. It played a key role in the\nconstruction of heterotic-string models with an anomaly free extra $Z^\\prime$\nsymmetry that may remain unbroken down to low energy scales. A generic\nsignature of the low scale string derived $Z^\\prime$ model is via di-photon\nexcess that may be within reach of the LHC. A fascinating possibility is that\nthe spinor-vector duality symmetry is rooted in the structure of the\nheterotic-string compactifications to two dimensions. The two dimensional\nheterotic-string theories are in turn related to the so-called moonshine\nsymmetries that underlie the two dimensional compactifications. In this paper\nwe embark on exploration of this connection by the free fermionic formulation\nto classify the symmetries of the two dimensional heterotic-string theories. We\nuse two complementary approaches in our classification. The first utilises a\nconstruction which is akin to the one used in the spinor-vector duality.\nUnderlying this method is the triality property of $SO(8)$ representations. In\nthe second approach we use the free fermionic tools to classify the twenty four\ndimensional Niemeier lattices.\n", "  It is well known that Kasner geometry with space-like singularity can be\nextended to bulk AdS-like geometry, furthermore one can study field theory on\nthis Kasner space via its gravity dual. In this paper, we show that there\nexists a Kasner-like geometry with timelike singularity for which one can\nconstruct a dual gravity description. We then study various extremal surfaces\nincluding space-like geodesics in the dual gravity description. Finally, we\ncompute correlators of highly massive operators in the boundary field theory\nwith a geodesic approximation.\n", "  This paper presents heavily grad-div and pressure jump stabilised, equal- and\nmixed-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods for non-isothermal\nincompressible flows based on the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation. In this\nframework, the enthalpy-porosity model for multiphase flow in melting and\nsolidification problems can be employed. By considering the differentially\nheated cavity and the melting of pure gallium in a rectangular enclosure, it is\nshown that both boundary layers and sharp moving interior layers can be handled\nnaturally by the proposed class of non-conforming methods. Due to the\nstabilising effect of the grad-div term and the robustness of discontinuous\nGalerkin methods, it is possible to solve the underlying problems accurately on\ncoarse, non-adapted meshes. The interaction of heavy grad-div stabilisation and\ndiscontinuous Galerkin methods significantly improves the mass conservation\nproperties and the overall accuracy of the numerical scheme which is observed\nfor the first time. Hence, it is inferred that stabilised discontinuous\nGalerkin methods are highly robust as well as computationally efficient\nnumerical methods to deal with natural convection problems arising in\nincompressible computational thermo-fluid dynamics.\n", "  We consider the recently suggested model of a multiverse based on a\nferrofluid. When the ferrofluid is subjected to a modest external magnetic\nfield, the nanoparticles inside the ferrofluid form small hyperbolic\nmetamaterial domains, which from the electromagnetic standpoint behave as\nindividual Minkowski universes exhibiting different laws of physics, such as\ndifferent strength of effective gravity, different versions of MOND and\ndifferent radiation lifetimes. When the ferrofluid multiverse is populated with\natomic or molecular species, and these species are excited using an external\nlaser source, the radiation lifetimes of atoms and molecules in these universes\ndepend strongly on the individual physical properties of each universe via the\nPurcell effect. Some universes are better fine-tuned than others to sustain the\nexcited states of these species. Thus, the ferrofluid-based metamaterial\nmultiverse may be used to study models of MOND and to illustrate the\nfine-tuning mechanism in cosmology.\n", "  The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a fundamental prediction of QCD, and\nvarious observables have been proposed in heavy ion collisions to access this\nphysics. Recently the CMS Collaboration \\cite{Khachatryan:2016got} has reported\nresults from p+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV on one such observable, the\nthree-point correlator. The results are strikingly similar to those measured at\nthe same particle multiplicity in Pb+Pb collisions, which have been attributed\nto the CME. This similarity, combined with two key assumptions about the\nmagnetic field in p+Pb collisions, presents a major challenge to the CME\npicture. These two assumptions as stated in the CMS paper are (1) that the\nmagnetic field in p+Pb collisions is smaller than that in Pb+Pb collisions and\n(2) that the magnetic field direction is uncorrelated with the flow angle. We\ntest these two postulates in the Monte Carlo Glauber framework and find that\nthe magnetic fields are not significantly smaller in central p+Pb collisions,\nhowever the magnetic field direction and the flow angle are indeed\nuncorrelated. The second finding alone gives strong evidence that the\nthree-point correlator signal in Pb+Pb and p+Pb is not an indication of the\nCME. Similar measurements in d+Au over a range of energies accessible at RHIC\nwould be elucidating. In the same calculational framework, we find that even in\nPb+Pb collisions, where the magnetic field direction and the flow angle are\ncorrelated, there exist large inhomogeneities that are on the size scale of\ntopological domains. These inhomogeneities need to be incorporated in any\ndetailed CME calculation.\n", "  Crowdsourcing works by distributing many small tasks to large numbers of\nworkers, yet the true potential of crowdsourcing lies in workers doing more\nthan performing simple tasks---they can apply their experience and creativity\nto provide new and unexpected information to the crowdsourcer. One such case is\nwhen workers not only answer a crowdsourcer's questions but also contribute new\nquestions for subsequent crowd analysis, leading to a growing set of questions.\nThis growth creates an inherent bias for early questions since a question\nintroduced earlier by a worker can be answered by more subsequent workers than\na question introduced later. Here we study how to perform efficient\ncrowdsourcing with such growing question sets. By modeling question sets as\nnetworks of interrelated questions, we introduce algorithms to help curtail the\ngrowth bias by efficiently distributing workers between exploring new questions\nand addressing current questions. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that\nthese algorithms can efficiently explore an unbounded set of questions without\nlosing confidence in crowd answers.\n", "  In this paper we provide high precision estimates of the phase diagram of\nactive Brownian particles. We extract coexisting densities from simulations of\nphase separated states in an elongated box (slab geometry) which minimizes\nfinite-size effects and allows for precise determination of points on the\nbinodal lines. Using this method, we study the influence of both shape and\ndimensionality on the two-phase region. Active spheres and dumbbells of active\nparticles are compared to the known phase diagram of active Brownian disks. In\nthe case of dimers, both correlated and uncorrelated propulsion of the two\nbeads are studied. The influence of correlation is discussed through a simple\nmapping.\n", "  A central requirement for any quantum error correction scheme is the ability\nto perform quantum non-demolition measurements of an error syndrome,\ncorresponding to a special symmetry property of the encoding scheme. It is in\nparticular important that such a measurement does not introduce extra error\nmechanisms, not included in the error model of the correction scheme. In this\nletter, we ensure such a robustness by designing an interaction with a\nmeasurement device that preserves the degeneracy of the measured observable.\nMore precisely, we propose a scheme to perform continuous and quantum\nnon-demolition measurement of photon-number parity in a microwave cavity. This\ncorresponds to the error syndrome in a class of error correcting codes called\nthe cat-codes, which have recently proven to be efficient and versatile for\nquantum information processing. In our design, we exploit the strongly\nnonlinear Hamiltonian of a high-impedance Josephson circuit, coupling a high-Q\ncavity storage cavity mode to a low-Q readout one. By driving the readout\nresonator at its resonance, the phase of the reflected/transmitted signal\ncarries directly exploitable information on parity-type observables for encoded\ncat-qubits of the high-Q mode.\n", "  Ginzburg-Landau theory describes phase transitions as the competition between\nenergy and entropy: The ordered phase has lower energy, while the disordered\nphase has larger entropy. When heating the system, ordering is reduced\nentropically until it vanishes at the critical temperature. This established\npicture implicitly assumes that the energy difference between ordered and\ndisordered phase does not change with temperature. We show that for the Mott\ninsulator KCuF3 this assumption is strongly violated: thermal expansion\nenergetically stabilizes the orbitally-ordered phase to such and extent that no\nphase transition is observed. This new mechanism explains not only the absence\nof a phase transition in KCuF3 but even suggests the possibility of an inverted\ntransition in closed-shell systems, where the ordered phase emerges only at\nhigh temperatures.\n", "  In a cyclic entropy model in which the extroverse is jettisoned at turnaround\nwith a Come Back Empty (CBE) assumption, we address matching of the contaction\nscale factor $\\hat{a}(t)=f(t_T){a}(t)$ to the expansion scale factor $a(t)$,\nwhere $f(t_T)$ is the ratio at turnaround of the introverse to extroverse\nradii. Such matching is necessary for infinite cyclicity and fixes the CBE\nperiod at $\\sim 2.6Ty$.\n", "  Duality is an indispensable tool for describing the strong-coupling dynamics\nof gauge theories. However, its actual realization is often quite subtle:\nquantities such as the partition function can transform covariantly, with\ndegrees of freedom rearranged in a nonlocal fashion. We study this phenomenon\nin the context of the electromagnetic duality of abelian $p$-forms. A careful\ncalculation of the duality anomaly on an arbitrary $D$-dimensional manifold\nshows that the effective actions agree exactly in odd $D$, while in even $D$\nthey differ by a term proportional to the Euler number. Despite this anomaly,\nthe trace of the stress tensor agrees between the dual theories. We also\ncompute the change in the vacuum entanglement entropy under duality, relating\nthis entanglement anomaly to the duality of an \"edge mode\" theory in two fewer\ndimensions. Previous work on this subject has led to conflicting results; we\nexplain and resolve these discrepancies.\n", "  We review correlation inequalities of truncated functions for the classical\nand quantum XY models. A consequence is that the critical temperature of the XY\nmodel is necessarily smaller than that of the Ising model, in both the\nclassical and quantum cases. We also discuss an explicit lower bound on the\ncritical temperature of the quantum XY model.\n", "  Beginning with the pioneering work of Regge and Wheeler (Phys. Rev. 108,\n1957), there have been many studies of perturbations away from the\nSchwarzschild spacetime background. In particular several authors (e.g.\nMoncrief, Ann. Phys 88, 1974) have investigated gauge invariant quantities of\nthe Regge-Wheeler (RW) gauge. Steven Detweiler also investigated perturbations\nof Schwarzschild in his own gauge, which he denoted the \"easy (EZ) gauge\", and\nwhich he was in the process of adapting for use in the second-order self-force\nproblem. We present here a compilation of some of his working results, arising\nfrom notes for which there seems to have been no manuscript in preparation. In\nparticular, we list the gauge invariant quantities used by Detweiler, as well\nas explain the process by which he found them.\n", "  Determining the differential-rotation law of compact stellar objects produced\nin binary neutron stars mergers or core-collapse supernovae is an old problem\nin relativistic astrophysics. Addressing this problem is important because it\nimpacts directly on the maximum mass these objects can attain and hence on the\nthreshold to black-hole formation under realistic conditions. Using the results\nfrom a large number of numerical simulations in full general relativity of\nbinary neutron star mergers described with various equations of state and\nmasses, we study the rotational properties of the resulting hypermassive\nneutron stars. We find that the angular-velocity distribution shows only a\nmodest dependence on the equation of state, thus exhibiting the traits of\n\"quasi-universality\" found in other aspects of compact stars, both isolated and\nin binary systems. The distributions are characterized by an almost uniformly\nrotating core and a \"disk\". Such a configuration is significantly different\nfrom the $j-{\\rm constant}$ differential-rotation law that is commonly adopted\nin equilibrium models of differentially rotating stars. Furthermore, the\nrest-mass contained in such a disk can be quite large, ranging from $\\simeq\n0.03\\,M_{\\odot}$ in the case of high-mass binaries with stiff equations of\nstate, up to $\\simeq 0.2\\,M_{\\odot}$ for low-mass binaries with soft equations\nof state. We comment on the astrophysical implications of our findings and on\nthe long-term evolutionary scenarios that can be conjectured on the basis of\nour simulations.\n", "  One of the important goals of present research is to control and manipulate\ncoherence in a broad variety of systems, such as semiconductor spintronics,\nbiological photosynthetic systems, superconducting qubits and complex atomic\nnetworks. Over the past decades interferometry of atoms and molecules has\nproven to be a powerful tool to explore coherence. Here we demonstrate a\nnear-field interferometer based on the Talbot effect, which allows to measure\nfinite-range phase coherence of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. We apply\nthis interferometer to study the build-up of phase coherence after a quantum\nquench of a Bose-Einstein condensate residing in a one-dimensional optical\nlattice. Our technique of measuring finite-range phase coherence is generic,\neasy to adopt, and can be applied in practically all lattice experiments\nwithout further modifications.\n", "  We propose how topologically non-trivial states can dynamically organize in a\nfermionic quantum gas which is confined to a two-dimensional optical lattice\npotential and coupled to the field of an optical cavity. The spontaneously\nemerging cavity field induces together with coherent pump laser fields a\ndynamical gauge field for the atoms. Upon adiabatic elimination of the cavity\ndegree of freedom, the system is described by an effective Hofstadter model\nwith a self-consistency condition which determines the tunneling amplitude\nalong the cavity direction. The fermions are found to self-organize into\ntopologically non-trivial states which carry an extended edge state for a\nfinite system size. Due to the dissipative nature of the cavity field, the\ntopological steady states are protected from external perturbations.\n", "  The precise value of the $g$-factor in graphene is of fundamental interest\nfor all spin-related properties and their application. We investigate monolayer\ngraphene on a Si/SiO2 substrate by resistively detected electron spin resonance\n(ESR). Surprisingly, the magnetic moment and corresponding g-factor of\n1.952+/-0.002 is insensitive to charge carrier type, concentration, and\nmobility.\n", "  A fundamental building block for nanophotonics is the ability to achieve\nnegative refraction of polaritons, because this could enable the demonstration\nof many unique nanoscale applications such as deep-subwavelength imaging,\nsuperlens, and novel guiding. However, to achieve negative refraction of highly\nsqueezed polaritons, such as plasmon polaritons in graphene and phonon\npolaritons in boron nitride (BN) with their wavelengths squeezed by a factor\nover 100, requires the ability to flip the sign of their group velocity at\nwill, which is challenging. Here we reveal that the strong coupling between\nplasmon and phonon polaritons in graphene-BN heterostructures can be used to\nflip the sign of the group velocity of the resulting hybrid\n(plasmon-phonon-polariton) modes. We predict all-angle negative refraction\nbetween plasmon and phonon polaritons, and even more surprisingly, between\nhybrid graphene plasmons, and between hybrid phonon polaritons. Graphene-BN\nheterostructures thus provide a versatile platform for the design of\nnano-metasurfaces and nano-imaging elements.\n", "  We compute the R\\'enyi mutual information of two disjoint spheres in free\nmassless scalar theory in even dimensions higher than two. The spherical twist\noperator in a conformal field theory can be expanded into the sum of local\nprimary operators and their descendants. We analyze the primary operators in\nthe replicated scalar theory and find the ones of the fewest dimensions and\nspins. We study the one-point function of these operators in the conical\ngeometry and obtain their expansion coefficients in the OPE of spherical twist\noperators. We show that the R\\'enyi mutual information can be expressed in\nterms of the conformal partial waves. We compute explicitly the R\\'enyi mutual\ninformation up to order $z^d$, where $z$ is the cross ratio and $d$ is the\nspacetime dimension.\n", "  Recent experiments reveal that the honeycomb ruthenium trichloride\n{\\alpha}-RuCl3 is a prime candidate of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL).\nHowever, there is no theoretical model which can properly describe its\nexperimental dynamical response, due to the lack of a full understanding of its\nmagnetic interactions. Here, we propose a general scheme to calculate the\nmagnetic interactions in systems (e.g., {\\alpha}-RuCl3) with non-negligible\norbital moments by constraining the directions of orbital moments. With this\nscheme, we put forward a minimal J1-K1-{\\Gamma}1-J3-K3 model for {\\alpha}-RuCl3\nand find that: (I) The third nearest neighbor (NN) antiferromagnetic Heisenberg\ninteraction J3 stabilizes the zigzag antiferromagnetic order; (II) The NN\nsymmetric off-diagonal exchange {\\Gamma}1 plays a pivotal role in determining\nthe preferred direction of magnetic moments and generating the spin wave gap.\nExact diagonalization study on this model shows that the Kitaev QSL can be\nrealized by suppressing the NN symmetric off-diagonal exchange {\\Gamma}1 and\nthe third NN Heisenberg interaction J3. Thus, we not only propose a powerful\ngeneral scheme for investigating the intriguing magnetism of Jeff=1/2 magnets,\nbut also point out future directions for realizing the Kitaev QSL in the\nhoneycomb ruthenium trichloride {\\alpha}-RuCl3.\n", "  We report on the development of two dual worm constructions that lead to\ncluster algorithms for efficient and ergodic Monte Carlo simulations of\nfrustrated Ising models with arbitrary two-spin interactions that extend up to\nthird-neighbours on the triangular lattice. One of these algorithms generalizes\nreadily to other frustrated systems, such as Ising antiferromagnets on the\nKagome lattice with further neighbour couplings. We characterize the\nperformance of both these algorithms in a challenging regime with power-law\ncorrelations at finite wavevector.\n", "  We study a large class of models of two-dimensional quantum lattice systems\nwith continuous symmetries, and we prove a general McBryan-Spencer-Koma-Tasaki\ntheorem concerning algebraic decay of correlations. We present applications of\nour main result to the Heisenberg-, Hubbard-, and t-J models, and to certain\nmodels of random loops.\n", "  Silk cocoons are reconstituted into an aqueous suspension, and protein\nstability is investigated by comparing the protein's response to hydrochloric\nacid and sodium chloride. Aggregation occurs at <8 mM hydrochloric acid that is\nnot correlated to protein protonation, while sodium chloride over the same\nrange of concentrations does not cause aggregation. We measure the structures\npresent on the protein and aggregate lengthscales in these solutions using both\noptical and neutron scattering, while mass spectrometry techniques shed light\non a possible mechanism for aggregate formation. We find that the introduction\nof acid modulates the aggregate size and pervaded volume of the protein, an\neffect that is not observed with salt.\n", "  Computer vision algorithms are powerful tools in astronomical image analyses,\nespecially when automation of object detection and extraction is required.\nModern object detection algorithms in astronomy are oriented towards detection\nof stars and galaxies, ignoring completely detection of existing linear\nfeatures. With the emergence of wide-field sky surveys, linear features attract\nscientific interest as possible trails of fast flybys of near-Earth asteroids\nand meteors. In this work we describe a new linear feature detection algorithm\ndesigned specifically for implementation in Big Data astronomy. The algorithm\ncombines a series of algorithmic steps that first remove other objects (stars,\ngalaxies) from the image and then enhance the line to enable more efficient\nline detection with the Hough algorithm. The rate of false positives is greatly\nreduced thanks to a step that replaces possible line segments with rectangles\nand then compares lines fitted to the rectangles with the lines obtained\ndirectly from the image. The speed of the algorithm and its applicability in\nastronomical surveys are also discussed.\n", "  We present predictions for the galaxy-galaxy lensing profile from the EAGLE\nhydrodynamical cosmological simulation at redshift z=0.18, in the spatial range\n0.02 < R/(Mpc/h) < 2, and for five logarithmically equi-spaced stellar mass\nbins in the range 10.3 < $\\log_{10}$(Mstar/ $M_{\\odot}$) < 11.8. We compare\nthese excess surface density profiles to the observed signal from background\ngalaxies imaged by the Kilo Degree Survey around spectroscopically confirmed\nforeground galaxies from the GAMA survey. Exploiting the GAMA galaxy group\ncatalogue, the profiles of central and satellite galaxies are computed\nseparately for groups with at least five members to minimise contamination.\nEAGLE predictions are in broad agreement with the observed profiles for both\ncentral and satellite galaxies, although the signal is underestimated at\nR$\\approx$0.5-2 Mpc/h for the highest stellar mass bins. When central and\nsatellite galaxies are considered simultaneously, agreement is found only when\nthe selection function of lens galaxies is taken into account in detail.\nSpecifically, in the case of GAMA galaxies, it is crucial to account for the\nvariation of the fraction of satellite galaxies in bins of stellar mass induced\nby the flux-limited nature of the survey. We report the inferred\nstellar-to-halo mass relation and we find good agreement with recent published\nresults. We note how the precision of the galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles in the\nsimulation holds the potential to constrain fine-grained aspects of the\ngalaxy-dark matter connection.\n", "  We study hard core bosons on a two leg ladder lattice under the orbital\neffect of a uniform magnetic field. At densities which are incommensurate with\nflux, the ground state is a Meissner state, or a vortex state, depending on the\nstrength of the flux. When the density is commensurate with the flux,\nanalytical arguments predict the existence of a ground state of central charge\n$c = 1$, which displays signatures compatible with the expected Laughlin state\nat $\\nu=1/2$. This differs from the coupled wire construction of the Laughlin\nstate in that there exists a nonzero backscattering term in the edge\nHamiltonian. We construct a phase diagram versus density and flux in order to\ndelimit the region where this precursor to the Laughlin state is the ground\nstate, by using a combination of bosonization and numerics based on the density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) and exact diagonalization. We obtain the\nphase diagram from local observables and central charge. We use bipartite\ncharge fluctuations to deduce the Luttinger parameter for the edge Luttinger\nliquid corresponding to the Laughlin state. The properties studied with local\nobservables are confirmed by the long distance behavior of correlation\nfunctions. Our findings are consistent with a calculation of the many body\nground state transverse conductivity in a thin torus geometry for parameters\ncorresponding to the Laughlin state. The model considered is simple enough such\nthat the precursor to the Laughlin state could be realized in current ultracold\natom, Josephson junction array, and quantum circuit experiments.\n", "  We propose an optomechanics experiment that can search for signatures of a\nfundamentally classical theory of gravity and in particular of the many-body\nSchroedinger-Newton (SN) equation, which governs the evolution of a crystal\nunder a self-gravitational field. The SN equation predicts that the dynamics of\na macroscopic mechanical oscillator's center of mass wavefunction differ from\nthe predictions of standard quantum mechanics. This difference is largest for\nlow-frequency oscillators, and for materials, such as Tungsten or Osmium, with\nsmall quantum fluctuations of the constituent atoms around their lattice\nequilibrium sites. Light probes the motion of these oscillators and is\neventually measured in order to extract valuable information on the pendulum's\ndynamics. Due to the non-linearity contained in the SN equation, we analyze the\nfluctuations of measurement results differently than standard quantum\nmechanics. We revisit how to model a thermal bath, and the wavefunction\ncollapse postulate, resulting in two prescriptions for analyzing the quantum\nmeasurement of the light. We demonstrate that both predict features, in the\noutgoing light's phase fluctuations' spectrum, which are separate from\nclassical thermal fluctuations and quantum shot noise, and which can be clearly\nresolved with state of the art technology.\n", "  We introduce time-dependent variational Monte Carlo for continuous-space Bose\ngases. Our approach is based on the systematic expansion of the many-body\nwave-function in terms of multi-body correlations and is essentially exact up\nto adaptive truncation. The method is benchmarked by comparison to exact\nBethe-ansatz or existing numerical results for the integrable Lieb-Liniger\nmodel. We first show that the many-body wave-function achieves high precision\nfor ground-state properties, including energy and first-order as well as\nsecond-order correlation functions. Then, we study the out-of-equilibrium,\nunitary dynamics induced by a quantum quench in the interaction strength. Our\ntime-dependent variational Monte Carlo results are benchmarked by comparison to\nexact Bethe ansatz results available for a small number of particles, and also\ncompared to quench action results available for non-interacting initial states.\nMoreover, our approach allows us to study large particle numbers and general\nquench protocols, previously inaccessible beyond the mean-field level. Our\nresults suggest that it is possible to find correlated initial states for which\nthe long-term dynamics of local density fluctuations is close to the\npredictions of a simple Boltzmann ensemble.\n", "  We use holographic QCD to study Pomeron- and Reggeon-mediated central\nproduction in Regge regime hadronic scattering. We focus specifically on $\\eta$\nproduction in proton-proton collisions. While previous work studied the\nPomeron-mediated process, the mesonic Regge trajectories (\"Reggeons\") we now\nincorporate contribute significantly at experimentally probed energies. We use\nthe five-point open string amplitude (in flat space) to construct approximate\npropagators for the Reggeon states, and the five-point closed string amplitude\nfor the Pomeron. Using these \"holographic\" Reggeons and Pomerons, and\nlow-energy couplings derived in the Sakai-Sugimoto model, we compute the\ndifferential and total cross sections at $\\sqrt{s}$ =29.1 GeV. Our calculation\nof the total cross section is $\\sigma =236 \\ \\mathrm{nb}$, while the\nexperimentally measured value is $\\sigma = 3859 \\ \\mathrm{nb}$. The discrepancy\nbetween our result and the measured value may indicate that our model\nsystematically underestimates the values of the relevant coupling constants.\n", "  We discuss the pole mass and the width of the $\\Delta(1232)$ resonance to\nthird order in chiral effective field theory. In our calculation we choose the\ncomplex-mass renormalization scheme (CMS) and show that the CMS provides a\nconsistent power-counting scheme. In terms of the pion-mass dependence, we\ncompare the convergence behavior of the CMS with the small-scale expansion\n(SSE).\n", "  The Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency has long served as the definite upper bound for\nthe thermal efficiency at maximum output power, and has thus shaped the\ndevelopment of finite-time thermodynamics. In this paper, we repeal the ruling\nconsensus according to which it has a genuine universal character that can be\nderived from linear irreversible thermodynamics. We demonstrate that the\nCurzon-Ahlborn efficiency should instead properly be associated with a\nparticular case of nonlinear heat engines, and we derive a generalized\nexpression for the efficiency at maximum power beyond the restrictive case of\nlinear models.\n", "  We demonstrate that zero-energy Majorana bound state, in the ferromagnetic\ninsulator (FI)-superconductor (SC) junction formed on the edge of\ntwo-dimensional topological insulator, exhibits three types of spin-triplet\npairing correlations and its spin polarization direction is position\nindependent in ferromagnetic insulator. When an electron is injected with a\nspin (anti-)parallel to this direction, equal-spin Andreev reflection exhibits\nthe widest (narrowest) resonance peak. Similar behaviour is found when the\ncoupling between two Majorana bound states in a FI-SC-FI junction is invoked,\nthough an additional weak spin-singlet pairing correlation is generated. These\nsignatures can readily facilitate the experimental detection of spin-triplet\ncorrelations and spin polarization of Majorana bound states.\n", "  A structure formed by dust particles ejected from the debris ring around HD\n61005 is observed in the scattered light. The main aim here is to constrain\ninterstellar wind parameters that lead to shape morphology in the vicinity of\nHD 61005 using currently available observational data for the debris ring.\nEquation of motion of 2 $\\times$ 10$^5$ dust particles ejected from the debris\nring under the action of the electromagnetic radiation, stellar wind, and\ninterstellar wind is solved. A two-dimensional (2D) grid is placed in a given\ndirection for accumulation of the light scattered on the dust particles in\norder to determine the shape morphology. The interaction of the interstellar\nwind and the stellar wind is considered. Groups of unknown properties of the\ninterstellar wind that create the observed morphology are determined. A\nrelation between number densities of gas components in the interstellar wind\nand its relative velocity is found. Variations of the shape morphology caused\nby the interaction with the interstellar clouds of various temperatures are\nstudied. When the interstellar wind velocity is tilted from debris ring axis a\nsimple relation between the properties of the interstellar wind and an angle\nbetween the line of sight and the interstellar wind velocity exists. Dust\nparticles that are most significantly influenced by stellar radiation move on\nthe boundary of observed structure. Observed structure at HD 61005 can be\nexplained as a result of dust particles moving under the action of the\ninterstellar wind. Required number densities or velocities of the interstellar\nwind are much higher than that of the interstellar wind entering the Solar\nsystem.\n", "  The soft wall model is extended to accommodate at the same time (i)\napproximately linear $\\rho$ meson Regge trajectories at zero temperature $T$,\n(ii) various options for the thermodynamics with reference to QCD (cross over\nor second-order transition or first-order transition at $T_c$), and (iii) the\nappearance of vector meson states at $T \\leq T_c$. While the vector meson\nmasses display some modest model dependence very near to $T_c$, they stay below\n$T_c$ to good accuracy independent of the temperature, that is nearly as at\n$T=0$, thus being very consistent with the thermo-statistical models widely\nemployed in analyses of the hadron yields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions\nin a region where baryon densitiy effects can be neglected and the vacuum\nhadron masses are used.\n", "  Following a new microlensing constraint on primordial black holes (PBHs) with\n$\\sim10^{20}$--$10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{g}$~[1], we revisit the idea of PBH as all\nDark Matter (DM). We have shown that the updated observational constraints\nsuggest the viable mass function for PBHs as all DM to have a peak at $\\simeq\n10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{g}$ with a small width $\\sigma \\lesssim 0.1$, by imposing\nobservational constraints on an extended mass function in a proper way. We have\nalso provided an inflation model that successfully generates PBHs as all DM\nfulfilling this requirement.\n", "  We derive an extended fluctuation theorem for a geometric pumping in a\nspin-boson system under a periodic control of environmental temperatures by\nusing a Markovian quantum master equation. We perform the Monte-Carlo\nsimulation and obtain the current distribution, the average current and the\nfluctuation. Using the extended fluctuation theorem we try to explain the\nresults of our simulation. The fluctuation theorem leads to the fluctuation\ndissipation relations but the absence of the conventional reciprocal relation.\n", "  We consider the Josephson effect through a thin spin-orbit coupled layer in\nthe presence of an exchange field, and discover a set of supercurrent vortices\nappearing in the system which can be controllably moved around in the system by\nvarying either the direction of the exchange field, its strength, or the\nspin-orbit coupling magnitude via a gate voltage. We refer to this phenomenon\nas a supercurrent vortex pinball effect and show that its origin is the spin\npolarization of the triplet Cooper pairs induced in the system. The\nsupercurrent vortices thus arise from what resembles a Cooper pair-induced\ninverse Edelstein effect. Our results highlight the importance of considering\nhigher-dimensional models for superconducting hybrid structures which unveils\nnovel phenomena that are hidden in commonly used effective 1D models.\n", "  We propose a new holographic dual of conformal field theory defined on a\nmanifold with boundaries, i.e. BCFT. Our proposal can apply to general\nboundaries and agrees with arXiv:1105.5165 for the special case of a disk and\nhalf plane. Using the new proposal of AdS/BCFT, we successfully obtain the\nexpected boundary Weyl anomaly and the obtained boundary central charges\nsatisfy naturally a c-like theorem holographically. We also investigate the\nholographic entanglement entropy of BCFT and find that the minimal surface must\nbe normal to the bulk spacetime boundaries when they intersect.\nInterestingly,the entanglement entropy depends on the boundary conditions of\nBCFT and the distance to the boundary. The entanglement wedge has an\ninteresting phase transition which is important for the self-consistency of\nAdS/BCFT.\n", "  We analyze the prospects for resonant di-Higgs production searches at the LHC\nin the $b\\bar{b} W^+ W^-$ ($W^{+} \\to \\ell^{+} \\nu_{\\ell}$, $W^{-} \\to \\ell^{-}\n\\bar{\\nu}_{\\ell}$) channel, as a probe of the nature of the electroweak phase\ntransition in Higgs portal extensions of the Standard Model. In order to\nmaximize the sensitivity in this final state, we develop a new algorithm for\nthe reconstruction of the $b \\bar{b} W^+ W^-$ invariant mass in the presence of\nneutrinos from the $W$ decays, building from a technique developed for the\nreconstruction of resonances decaying to $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ pairs. We show that\nresonant di-Higgs production in the $b\\bar{b} W^+ W^-$ channel could be a\ncompetitive probe of the electroweak phase transition already with the datasets\nto be collected by the CMS and ATLAS experiments in Run-2 of the LHC. The\nincrease in sensitivity with larger amounts of data accumulated during the High\nLuminosity LHC phase can be sufficient to enable a potential discovery of the\nresonant di-Higgs production in this channel.\n", "  A novel scaling type of Fixed-Field Alternating-Gradient (FFAG) accelerator\nis proposed that solves the major problems of conventional scaling FFAGs. This\nscaling FFAG accelerator combines reverse bending magnets of the radial sector\ntype and a spiral edge angle of the spiral sector type to ensure sufficient\nvertical focusing without relying on extreme values of either parameter. This\nnew concept makes it possible to design a scaling FFAG for high energy (above\nGeV range) applications such as a proton driver for a spallation neutron source\nand an accelerator driven subcritical reactor.\n", "  We consider the characterization as well as the construction of quantum codes\nthat allow to transmit both quantum and classical information, which we refer\nto as `hybrid codes'. We construct hybrid codes $[\\![n,k{: }m,d]\\!]_q$ with\nlength $n$ and distance $d$, that simultaneously transmit $k$ qudits and $m$\nsymbols from a classical alphabet of size $q$. Many good codes such as\n$[\\![7,1{: }1,3]\\!]_2$, $[\\![9,2{: }2,3]\\!]_2$, $[\\![10,3{: }2,3]\\!]_2$,\n$[\\![11,4{: }2,3]\\!]_2$, $[\\![11,1{: }2,4]\\!]_2$, $[\\![13,1{: }4,4]\\!]_2$,\n$[\\![13,1{: }1,5]\\!]_2$, $[\\![14,1{: }2,5]\\!]_2$, $[\\![15,1{: }3,5]\\!]_2$,\n$[\\![19,9{: }1,4]\\!]_2$, $[\\![20,9{: }2,4]\\!]_2$, $[\\![21,9{: }3,4]\\!]_2$,\n$[\\![22,9{: }4,4]\\!]_2$ have been found. All these codes have better parameters\nthan hybrid codes obtained from the best known stabilizer quantum codes.\n", "  In this paper we provide a quantum field theoretical study on the shear and\nbulk relaxation times. First, we find Kubo formulas for the shear and the bulk\nrelaxation times, respectively. They are found by examining response functions\nof the stress-energy tensor. We use general properties of correlation functions\nand the gravitational Ward identity to parametrize analytical structures of the\nGreen functions describing both sound and diffusion mode. We find that the\nhydrodynamic limits of the real parts of the respective energy-momentum tensor\ncorrelation functions provide us with the method of computing both the shear\nand bulk viscosity relaxation times. Next, we calculate the shear viscosity\nrelaxation time using the diagrammatic approach in the Keldysh basis for the\nmassless $\\lambda\\phi^4$ theory. We derive a respective integral equation which\nenables us to compute $\\eta\\tau_\\pi$ and then we extract the shear relaxation\ntime. The relaxation time is shown to be inversely related to the thermal width\nas it should be.\n", "  We introduce phenomenological understanding of the electromagnetic component\nof the physical vacuum, the EM vacuum, as a basic medium for all masses of the\nexpanding Universe, and \"Casimir polarization\" of this medium arising in the\nvicinity of any material object in the Universe as a result of conjugation of\nthe electric field components of the EM vacuum on both sides (\"external\" and\n\"internal\") of atomic nucleus boundary of the each mass with vacuum. It is\nshown that the gravitational attraction of two material objects in accordance\nwith Newton's law of gravity arises as a result of overlapping of the domains\nof the EM vacuum Casimir polarization created by atomic nuclei of the objects,\ntaking into account the long-range gravitational influence of all masses of the\nUniverse on each nucleus of these objects (Mach's idea). Newton's law of\ngravitational attraction between two bodies is generalized to the case of\ngravitational interaction of a system of bodies when the center of mass of the\npair of bodies shifted relative to the center of mass of the system. The unique\nsmallness of gravitational interactions as compared with the fundamental\nnuclear (strong and weak) and electromagnetic ones is determined by the ratio\nof the characteristic size of the domain of EM vacuum Casimir polarization in\nthe vicinity of atomic nuclei to the Hubble radius of the Universe.\n", "  The differential cross section for inclusive particle production as a\nfunction of energy in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13\nTeV is measured in the very forward region of the CMS detector. The measurement\nis based on data collected with the CMS apparatus at the LHC, and corresponds\nto an integrated luminosity of 0.35 inverse microbarns. The energy is measured\nin the CASTOR calorimeter, which covers the pseudorapidity region -6.6 < eta <\n-5.2. The results are given as a function of the total energy deposited in\nCASTOR, as well as of its electromagnetic and hadronic components. The spectra\nare sensitive to the modeling of multiparton interactions in pp collisions, and\nprovide new constraints for hadronic interaction models used in collider and in\nhigh energy cosmic ray physics.\n", "  We compute the CMB angular power spectrum in the presence of a radiation-like\nsolid - elastic matter with the same pressure to energy density ratio as\nradiation but with nonzero shear modulus. For the values of shear modulus that\nare close enough to zero, so that the effect of the solid on large-scale\nanisotropies remains within cosmic variance, we find that there is an\nobservable effect of the solid on small-scale anisotropies.\n", "  The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect is a powerful probe of the evolution of\nstructures in the universe, and is thus highly sensitive to cosmological\nparameters $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_m$, though its power is hampered by the\ncurrent uncertainties on the cluster mass calibration. In this analysis we\nrevisit constraints on these cosmological parameters as well as the hydrostatic\nmass bias, by performing (i) a robust estimation of the tSZ power-spectrum,\n(ii) a complete modeling and analysis of the tSZ bispectrum, and (iii) a\ncombined analysis of galaxy clusters number count, tSZ power spectrum, and tSZ\nbispectrum. From this analysis, we derive as final constraints $\\sigma_8 = 0.79\n\\pm 0.02$, $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.29 \\pm 0.02$, and $(1-b) = 0.71 \\pm 0.07$. These\nresults favour a high value for the hydrostatic mass bias compared to numerical\nsimulations and weak-lensing based estimations. They are furthermore consistent\nwith both previous tSZ analyses, CMB derived cosmological parameters, and\nancillary estimations of the hydrostatic mass bias.\n", "  The ultrafast response to an optical pulse excitation of the spin-spin\nexchange interaction in transition metal anti-ferromagnets is studied within\nthe framework of the time-dependent spin-density functional theory. We propose\na formulation for the purely dynamical exchange interaction, which is non-local\nin space, and it is derived starting from {\\it ab initio} arguments. Then, we\ninvestigate the effect of the laser pulse on the onset of the dynamical\nprocess. It is found that we can distinguish two types of excitations, both\nactivated immediately after the action of the laser pulse. While the first one\ncan be associated to a Stoner-like excitation and involves the transfer of spin\nfrom one site to another, the second one is related to the ultrafast\nmodification of a Heisenberg-like exchange interaction and can trigger the\nformation of spin waves in the first few hundred femtoseconds of the time\nevolution.\n", "  Because of their universal nature, Fano fluctuations are expected to\ninfluence the response of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors\n(SNSPDs). We predict that photon counting rate ($PCR$) as a function of bias\ncurrent ($I_B$) in SNSPDs is described by an integral over a transverse\ncoordinate-dependent complementary error function. The latter describes\nsmearing of local responses due to Fano fluctuations of the amount of energy\ndeposited into electronic system. The finite width, $\\sigma$, of the $PCR$ vs\n$I_B$ arises from fluctuations in the energy partition between quasiparticles\nand phonons during the energy down-conversion cascade. In narrow-nanowire\nSNSPDs the local responses are uniform, and the effect of Fano-fluctuations on\n$\\sigma$ is dominant. In wide-nanowire SNSPDs with strong coordinate dependence\nof local responses due to vortex-antivortex unbinding and vortex entry from\nedges, Fano-fluctuations smear singularities imprinted by vorticity on the\ntransition part of $PCR$ curve. We demonstrate good agreement between theory\nand experiments for a series of bath temperatures and photon energies in\nnarrow-wire WSi SNSPDs. The time-resolved hotspot relaxation curves predicted\nby Fano fluctuations match the Lorentzian shapes observed in experiments over\nthe whole range of bias currents investigated except for their tails.\n", "  The existing degeneracy between different dark energy and modified gravity\ncosmologies at the background level may be broken by analysing quantities at\nthe perturbative level. In this work, we apply a non-parametric smoothing (NPS)\nmethod to reconstruct the expansion history of the Universe ($H(z)$) from\nmodel-independent cosmic chronometers and high-$z$ quasar data. Assuming a\nhomogeneous and isotropic flat universe and general relativity (GR) as the\ngravity theory, we calculate the non-relativistic matter perturbations in the\nlinear regime using the $H(z)$ reconstruction and realistic values of\n$\\Omega_{m0}$ and $\\sigma_8$ from Planck and WMAP-9 collaborations. We find a\ngood agreement between the measurements of the growth rate and $f\\sigma_8(z)$\nfrom current large-scale structure observations and the estimates obtained from\nthe reconstruction of the cosmic expansion history. Considering a recently\nproposed null test for GR using matter perturbations, we also apply the NPS\nmethod to reconstruct $f\\sigma_8(z)$. For this case, we find a $\\sim 2\\sigma$\ntension (good agreement) with the standard relativistic cosmology when the\nPlanck (WMAP-9) priors are used.\n", "  The extreme mechanical resilience of graphene and the peculiar coupling it\nhosts between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom have spawned a strong\nimpetus towards strain-engineered graphene where, on the one hand, strain\naugments the richness of its phenomenology and makes possible new concepts for\nelectronic devices and, on the other hand, new and extreme physics might take\nplace. Here, we demonstrate that the shape of substrates supporting graphene\nsheets can be optimized for approachable experiments where strain-induced\npseudomagnetic fields (PMF) can be tailored by pressure for directionally\nselective electronic transmission and pinching-off of current flow down to the\nquantum channel limit. The Corbino-type layout explored here furthermore allows\nfiltering of charge carriers according to valley and current direction, which\ncan be used to inject or collect valley-polarized currents, thus realizing one\nof the basic elements required for valleytronics. Our results are based on a\nframework developed to realistically determine the combination of strain,\nexternal parameters, and geometry optimally compatible with the target spatial\nprofile of a desired physical property --- the PMF in this case. Characteristic\nconductance profiles are analyzed through quantum transport calculations on\nlarge graphene devices having the optimal shape.\n", "  We consider a quantum wire, containing two Majorana bound states (MBS) at its\nends that are coupled to a current lead on one side and to a quantum dot (QD)\non the other side. Using the method of full counting statistics we calculate\nthe conductance and the zero-frequency noise. Using an effective low-energy\nmodel, we analyze in detail the Andreev reflection probability as a function of\nthe various system parameters and show that it exhibits a Fano resonance (FR)\nline shape in the case of a weakly coupled QD as a function of the QD energy\nlevel when the two MBS overlap. The asymmetry parameter changes sign as the\nbias voltage is tuned through the MBS overlap energy. The FR is mirrored as a\nfunction of the QD level energy as long as tunneling to the more distant MBS is\nnegligible. However, if both MBS are coupled to the lead and the QD, the height\nas well as the asymmetry of the line shapes cease to respect this symmetry.\nThese two exclusive cases uniquely distinguish the coupling to a MBS from the\ncoupling to a fermionic bound state that is shared between the two MBS. We\ncomplement the analysis by employing a discretized one-dimensional p-wave\nsuperconductor (Kitaev chain) for the quantum wire and show that the features\nof the effective low-energy model are robust towards a more complete\nHamiltonian and also persist at finite temperature.\n", "  A cylindrical container partially filled with a liquid in orbital shaking\nmotion, i.e. in circular translation with fixed orientation with respect to an\ninertial frame of reference, generates, along with a rotating sloshing wave, a\nmean flow rotating in the same direction as the wave. Here we investigate\nexperimentally the structure and the scaling of the wave flow and the\nLagrangian mean flow in the weakly nonlinear regime, for small forcing\namplitude and for forcing frequency far from the resonance, using conventional\nand stroboscopic particle image velocimetry. The Lagrangian mean flow is\ncomposed of a strong global rotation near the center and a non trivial pattern\nof poloidal recirculation vortices of weaker amplitude, mostly active near the\ncontact line. The global rotation near the center is robust with respect to\nchanges in viscosity and forcing frequency, and its amplitude compares well\nwith the predicted Stokes drift for an inviscid rotating sloshing wave. On the\nother hand, the spatial structure of the poloidal vortices show strong\nvariation with viscosity and forcing frequency, suggesting that it results from\nthe streaming flow driven by the complex oscillatory boundary layers near the\ncontact line.\n", "  Many natural and engineering systems are simultaneously subjected to a\ndriving force and a stabilizing force. The interplay between the two forces,\nespecially for highly nonlinear systems such as fluid flow, often results in\nsurprising features. Here we reveal such features in three different types of\nRayleigh-B\\'enard (RB) convection, i.e. buoyancy-driven flow with the fluid\ndensity being affected by a scalar field. In the three cases different {\\it\nstabilizing forces} are considered, namely (i) horizontal confinement, (ii)\nrotation around a vertical axis, and (iii) a second stabilizing scalar field.\nDespite the very different nature of the stabilizing forces and the\ncorresponding equations of motion, at moderate strength we counterintuitively\nbut consistently observe an {\\it enhancement} in the flux, even though the flow\nmotion is weaker than the original RB flow. The flux enhancement occurs in an\nintermediate regime in which the stabilizing force is strong enough to alter\nthe flow structures in the bulk to a more organised morphology, yet not too\nstrong to severely suppress the flow motions. Near the optimal transport\nenhancements all three systems exhibit a transition from a state in which the\nthermal boundary layer (BL) is nested inside the momentum BL to the one with\nthe thermal BL being thicker than the momentum BL.\n", "  The meson static properties are investigated in Pauli-Villars regularized\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model in strong magnetic field. The quark dimension\nreduction leads to not only the magnetic catalysis effect on chiral symmetry\nrestoration but also a sudden jump of the mass of the Goldstone mode at the\nMott transition temperature.\n", "  Recent analysis of the rotation curves of a large sample of galaxies with\nvery diverse stellar properties reveal a relation between the radial\nacceleration purely due to the baryonic matter and the one inferred directly\nfrom the observed rotation curves. Assuming the dark matter (DM) exists, this\nacceleration relation is tantamount to an acceleration relation between DM and\nbaryons. This leads us to a universal maximum acceleration for all halos. Using\nthe latter in DM profiles that predict inner cores implies that the central\nsurface density $\\mu_{DM} = \\rho_s r_s$ must be a universal constant, as\nsuggested by previous studies in selected galaxies, revealing a strong\ncorrelation between the density $\\rho_s$ and scale $r_s$ parameters in each\nprofile. We then explore the consequences of the constancy of $\\mu_{DM}$ in the\ncontext of the ultra-light scalar field dark matter model (SFDM). We find that\nfor this model $\\mu_{DM} = 648 \\, M_\\odot {\\rm pc}^{-2}$, and that the\nso-called WaveDM soliton profile should be an universal feature of the DM\nhalos. Comparing with data from the Milky Way and Andromeda satellites, we find\nthat they are consistent with a boson mass of the scalar field particle of the\norder of $10^{-21} \\, {\\rm eV}/c^2$, which puts the SFDM model in agreement\nwith recent cosmological constraints.\n", "  We study an effective quantum description of the static gravitational\npotential for spherically symmetric systems up to the first post-Newtonian\norder. We start by obtaining a Lagrangian for the gravitational potential\ncoupled to a static matter source from the weak field expansion of the\nEinstein-Hilbert action. By analysing a few classical solutions of the\nresulting field equation, we show that our construction leads to the expected\npost-Newtonian expressions. Next, we show that one can reproduce the classical\nNewtonian results very accurately by employing a coherent quantum state and\nmodifications to include the first post-Newtonian corrections are considered.\nOur findings establish a connection between the corpuscular model of black\nholes and post-Newtonian gravity, and set the stage for further investigations\nof these quantum models.\n", "  We explore oscillations of the solar $^8$B neutrinos in the Earth in detail.\nThe relative excess of night $\\nu_e$ events (the Night-Day asymmetry) is\ncomputed as function of the neutrino energy and the nadir angle $\\eta$ of its\ntrajectory. The finite energy resolution of the detector causes an important\nattenuation effect, while the layer-like structure of the Earth density leads\nto an interesting parametric suppression of the oscillations. Different\nfeatures of the $\\eta-$ dependence encode information about the structure (such\nas density jumps) of the Earth density profile; thus measuring the $\\eta$\ndistribution allows the scanning of the interior of the Earth. We estimate the\nsensitivity of the DUNE experiment to such measurements. About 75 neutrino\nevents are expected per day in 40 kt. For high values of $\\Delta m^2_{21}$ and\n$E_\\nu > $11 MeV, the corresponding D-N asymmetry is about 4\\% and can be\nmeasured with $15\\%$ accuracy after 5 years of data taking. The difference of\nthe D-N asymmetry between high and low values of $\\Delta m^2_{21}$ can be\nmeasured at the $4\\sigma$ level. The relative excess of the $\\nu_e$ signal\nvaries with the nadir angle up to 50\\%. DUNE may establish the existence of the\ndip in the $\\eta-$ distribution at the $(2 - 3) \\sigma$ level.\n", "  The development of advanced spintronics devices hinges on the efficient\ngeneration and utilization of pure spin current. In materials with large\nspin-orbit coupling, the spin Hall effect may convert charge current to pure\nspin current and a large conversion efficiency, which is quantified by spin\nHall angle (SHA), is desirable for the realization of miniaturized and energy\nefficient spintronic devices. Here, we report a giant SHA in beta-tungsten\n(\\b{eta}-W) thin films in Sub/W(t)/Co20Fe60B20(3 nm)/SiO2(2 nm)\nheterostructures with variable W thickness. We employed an all-optical\ntime-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect microscope for an unambiguous\ndetermination of SHA using the principle of modulation of Gilbert damping of\nthe adjacent ferromagnetic layer by the spin-orbit torque from the W layer. A\nnon-monotonic variation of SHA with W layer thickness (t) is observed with a\nmaximum of about 0.4 at about t = 3 nm, followed by a sudden reduction to a\nvery low value at t = 6 nm. This variation of SHA with W-thickness correlates\nwell with the thickness dependent structural phase transition and resistivity\nvariation of W above the spin diffusion length of W, while below this length\nthe interfacial electronic effect at W/CoFeB influences the estimation of SHA.\n", "  Optical clock interrogation protocols, based on laser-pulse spectroscopy, are\nsuffering from probe-induced frequency shifts and their variations induced by\nlaser power. Original Hyper-Ramsey probing scheme, which was proposed to\nalleviate those issues, does not fully eliminate the shift, especially when\ndecoherence and relaxation by spontaneous emission or collisions are present.\nWe propose to solve the fundamental problem of frequency shifts induced by\nlaser probe by deriving the exact canonical form of a multi-pulse generalized\nHyper-Ramsey (GHR) resonance, including decoherence and relaxation. We present\na universal interrogation protocol based on composite laser-pulses spectroscopy\nwith phase-modulation eliminating probe-induced frequency shifts at all orders\nin presence of various dissipative processes. Unlike frequency shifts\nextrapolation-based methods, a universal interrogation protocol based on\n$\\pm\\pi/4$ and $\\pm3\\pi/4$ phase-modulated resonances is proposed which does\nnot compromise the stability of the optical clock while maintaining an\nultra-robust error signal gradient in presence of substantial uncompensated ac\nStark-shifts. Such a scheme can be implemented in two flavours: either by\ninverting clock state initialization or by pulse order reversal even without a\nperfect quantum state initialization. This universal interrogation protocol can\nbe applied to atomic, molecular and nuclear frequency metrology, mass\nspectrometry and to the field of precision spectroscopy. It might be designed\nusing magic-wave induced transitions, two-photon excitation and\nmagnetically-induced spectroscopy or it might even be implemented with quantum\nlogic gate circuit and qubit entanglement.\n", "  We address the problem of a lightly doped spin-liquid through a large-scale\ndensity-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) study of the $t$-$J$ model on a\nKagome lattice with a small but non-zero concentration, $\\delta$, of doped\nholes. It is now widely accepted that the undoped ($\\delta=0$) spin 1/2\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet has a spin-liquid groundstate. Theoretical arguments\nhave been presented that light doping of such a spin-liquid could give rise to\na high temperature superconductor or an exotic topological Fermi liquid metal\n(FL$^\\ast$). Instead, we infer that the doped holes form an insulating\ncharge-density wave state with one doped-hole per unit cell - i.e. a Wigner\ncrystal (WC). Spin correlations remain short-ranged, as in the spin-liquid\nparent state, from which we infer that the state is a crystal of spinless\nholons (WC$^\\ast$), rather than of holes. Our results may be relevant to Kagome\nlattice Herbertsmithite $\\rm ZnCu_3(OH)_6Cl_2$ upon doping.\n", "  We study the effects of electrostatic gating on the magnetization\nauto-oscillations induced by the local injection of electric current into a\nferromagnet/heavy metal bilayer. We find that the characteristic currents\nrequired for the excitation, the intensity and the spectral characteristics of\nthe generated dynamical states can be tuned by the voltage applied to the\nmetallic gate separated from the bilayer by a thin insulating layer. We show\nthat the effect of electrostatic gating becomes enhanced in the strongly\nnonlinear oscillation regime at sufficiently large driving currents. Analysis\nshows that the observed effects are caused by a combination of electric\nfield-dependent surface anisotropy and electric field-dependent contribution to\nthe current-induced spin-orbit torques. The demonstrated ability to control the\nmicrowave emission and spectral characteristics provides an efficient approach\nto the development of electrically tunable microwave nano-oscillators.\n", "  Interacting fermions on a lattice can develop strong quantum correlations,\nwhich lie at the heart of the classical intractability of many exotic phases of\nmatter. Seminal efforts are underway in the control of artificial quantum\nsystems, that can be made to emulate the underlying Fermi-Hubbard models.\nElectrostatically confined conduction band electrons define interacting quantum\ncoherent spin and charge degrees of freedom that allow all-electrical\npure-state initialisation and readily adhere to an engineerable Fermi-Hubbard\nHamiltonian. Until now, however, the substantial electrostatic disorder\ninherent to solid state has made attempts at emulating Fermi-Hubbard physics on\nsolid-state platforms few and far between. Here, we show that for gate-defined\nquantum dots, this disorder can be suppressed in a controlled manner. Novel\ninsights and a newly developed semi-automated and scalable toolbox allow us to\nhomogeneously and independently dial in the electron filling and\nnearest-neighbour tunnel coupling. Bringing these ideas and tools to fruition,\nwe realize the first detailed characterization of the collective Coulomb\nblockade transition, which is the finite-size analogue of the\ninteraction-driven Mott metal-to-insulator transition. As automation and device\nfabrication of semiconductor quantum dots continue to improve, the ideas\npresented here show how quantum dots can be used to investigate the physics of\never more complex many-body states.\n", "  Broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) of pure 5OCB and nanocolloids\nconsisting of 5OCB and paraelectric or ferroelectric BaTiO${_3}$ nanoparticles\n(NPs) was performed on varying pressure or temperature. We found strong impact\nof NPs on static and dynamic phase behavior. In particular, strongest effects\non pretransitional behavior were observed for a relatively low concentration of\nNPs which we attribute to the NPs-induced disorder. Paramagnetic or\nferromagnetic character of NPs did not significantly influence measurements.\nHowever, several features measured using temperature or pressure path in\nnanocolloids where significantly different, contrary to the observed behaviour\nin pure LC compounds. Dynamical properties were tested using the FDSE\n(fractional Debye-Stokes-Einstein) relation, yielding the fractional\ncoefficient S = 0.71 and S = 0.3 for the temperature and pressure path,\nrespectively.\n", "  This study focuses on investigating the manner in which a prompt quarantine\nmeasure suppresses epidemics in networks. A simple and ideal quarantine measure\nis considered in which an individual is detected with a probability immediately\nafter it becomes infected and the detected one and its neighbors are promptly\nisolated. The efficiency of this quarantine in suppressing a\nsusceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model is tested in random graphs and\nuncorrelated scale-free networks. Monte Carlo simulations are used to show that\nthe prompt quarantine measure outperforms random and acquaintance preventive\nvaccination schemes in terms of reducing the number of infected individuals.\nThe epidemic threshold for the SIR model is analytically derived under the\nquarantine measure, and the theoretical findings indicate that prompt\nexecutions of quarantines are highly effective in containing epidemics. Even if\ninfected individuals are detected with a very low probability, the SIR model\nunder a prompt quarantine measure has finite epidemic thresholds in fat-tailed\nscale-free networks in which an infected individual can always cause an\noutbreak of a finite relative size without any measure. The numerical\nsimulations also demonstrate that the present quarantine measure is effective\nin suppressing epidemics in real networks.\n", "  The well-known 5-parameter isometry group of plane gravitational waves in $4$\ndimensions is identified as Levy-Leblond's Carroll group in $2+1$ dimensions\nwith no rotations. Our clue is that plane waves are Bargmann spaces into which\nCarroll manifolds can be embedded. We also comment on the scattering of light\nby a gravitational wave and calculate its electric permittivity considered as\nan impedance-matched metamaterial.\n", "  The celebrated work of Onsager on hard particle systems, based on the\ntruncated second order virial expansion, is valid at relatively low volume\nfractions for large aspect ratio particles. While it predicts the\nisotropic-nematic phase transition, it fails to provide a realistic equation of\nstate in that the pressure remains finite for arbitrarily high densities. In\nthis work, we derive a mean field density functional form of the Helmholtz free\nenergy for nematics with hard core repulsion. In addition to predicting the\nisotropic-nematic transition, the model provides a more realistic equation of\nstate. The energy landscape is much richer, and the orientational probability\ndistribution function in the nematic phase possesses a unique feature: it\nvanishes on a nonzero measure set in orientational space.\n", "  We present an analytical study of the mode degeneracy in non-Hermitian\nphotonic crystals (PC) with $C_{4v}$ symmetry, from the perspective of the\ncoupled-wave-theory (CWT). The wave couplings and leakages within the\nnon-Hermitian PCs are depicted, and the condition of accidental triple\ndegeneracy is derived which leads to a Dirac-cone like dispersion. We prove\nthat, similar to the real Dirac-cone, the Dirac-cone like band in non-Hermitian\nPC possesses good linearity and isotropy in the vicinity of the $\\Gamma$ point.\nMoreover, some topological transit of the band may occur when the parameters\nadiabatically evolve. However, the Berry phase remains zero at the $\\Gamma$\npoint, indicated the Dirac-like-cone dosen't obey Dirac equation and it is only\nDirac-cone.\n", "  We compute the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in multi-Weyl semimetals\n(multi-WSMs) based on the chiral kinetic theory. Multi-WSMs are WSMs with\nmultiple monopole charges that have nonlinear and anisotropic dispersion\nrelations near Weyl points, and we need to extend conventional computation of\nCME in WSMs with linear dispersion relations. Topological properties of CME in\nmulti-WSMs are investigated in details for not only static magnetic fields but\nalso time-dependent (dynamic) ones. We propose an experimental setup to measure\nthe multiple monopole charge via the topological nature hidden in the dynamic\nCME.\n", "  We present the characterisation of the most recent parametric transducers\ndesigned to enhance the Mario Schenberg Gravitational Wave Detector\nsensitivity. The transducer is composed of a microwave re-entrant cavity that\nattaches to the gravitational wave antenna via a rigid spring. It functions as\na three-mode mass-spring system; motion of the spherical antenna couples to a\n50 $\\mu m$ thick membrane, which converts its mechanical motion into a\nfrequency shift of the cavity resonance. Through the optical spring effect, the\nmicrowave transducer frequency-displacement sensitivity was measured to be 726\n$MHz/\\mu$m at 4 K. The spherical antenna detection sensitivity is determined\nanalytically using the transducer amplification gain and equivalent\ndisplacement noise in the test setup, which are 5.5 $\\times$ 10$^{11} V/m$ and\n$1.8 \\times 10^{-19} m\\sqrt{Hz}^{-1}$, respectively.\n", "  We present an in-depth many-body investigation of the so-called mesoscopic\nmolecular ions that can build-up when an ion is immersed into an atomic\nBose-Einstein condensate in one dimension. To this end, we employ the\nMulti-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree method for Mixtures of\nultracold bosonic species for solving the underlying many-body Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. This enables us to unravel the actual structure of such massive\ncharged molecules from a microscopic perspective. Laying out their phase\ndiagram with respect to atom number and interatomic interaction strength, we\ndetermine the maximal number of atoms bound to the ion and reveal spatial\ndensities and molecular properties. Interestingly, we observe a strong\ninteraction-induced localization, especially for the ion, that we explain by\nthe generation of a large effective mass, similarly to ions in liquid Helium.\nFinally, we predict the dynamical response of the ion to small perturbations.\nOur results provide clear evidence for the importance of quantum correlations,\nas we demonstrate by benchmarking them with wave function ansatz classes\nemployed in the literature.\n", "  We investigate the low-energy scaling behavior of an interacting 3D Weyl\nsemimetal in the presence of disorder. In order to achieve a renormalization\ngroup analysis of the theory, we focus on the effects of a\nshort-ranged-correlated disorder potential, checking nevertheless that this\nchoice is not essential to locate the different phases of the Weyl semimetal.\nWe show that there is a line of fixed-points in the renormalization group flow\nof the interacting theory, corresponding to the disorder-driven transition to a\ndiffusive metal phase. Along that boundary, the critical disorder strength\nundergoes a strong increase with respect to the noninteracting theory, as a\nconsequence of the unconventional screening of the Coulomb and disorder-induced\ninteractions. A complementary resolution of the Schwinger-Dyson equations\nallows us to determine the full phase diagram of the system, showing the\nprevalence of a renormalized semimetallic phase in the regime of intermediate\ninteraction strength, and adjacent to the non-Fermi liquid phase characteristic\nof the strong interaction regime of 3D Weyl semimetals.\n", "  Recently, the existence of local magnetic moment in a hydrogen adatom on\ngraphene has been confirmed experimentally [Gonz\\'{a}lez-Herrero et al.,\nScience, 2016, 352, 437]. Inspired by this breakthrough, we theoretically\ninvestigate the top-site adatom on trilayer graphene (TLG) by solving the\nAnderson impurity model via self-consistent mean field method. The influence of\nthe stacking order, the adsorption site and external electric field are\ncarefully considered. We find that, due to its unique electronic structure, the\nsituation of the TLG is drastically different from that of the monolayer\ngraphene. Firstly, the adatom on rhombohedral stacked TLG (r-TLG) can have a\nFano-shaped impurity spectral density, instead of the normal Lorentzian-like\none, when the impurity level is around the Fermi level. Secondly, the impurity\nlevel of the adatom on r-TLG can be tuned into an in-gap state by an external\nelectric field, which strongly depends on the direction of the applied electric\nfield and can significantly affect the local magnetic moment formation.\nFinally, we systematically calculate the impurity magnetic phase diagrams,\nconsidering various stacking orders, adsorption sites, doping and electric\nfield. We show that, because of the in-gap state, the impurity magnetic phase\nof r-TLG will obviously depend on the direction of the applied electric field\nas well. All our theoretical results can be readily tested in experiment, and\nmay give a comprehensive understanding about the local magnetic moment of\nadatom on TLG.\n", "  Quantum oscillations in the binary antiferromagnetic metal FeAs are presented\nand compared to theoretical predictions for the electronic band structure in\nthe anomalous spin density wave state of this material. Demonstrating a new\nmethod for growing single crystals out of Bi flux, we utilize the highest\nquality FeAs to perform torque magnetometry experiments up to 35 T, using\nrotations of field angle in two planes to provide evidence for one electron and\none hole band in the magnetically ordered state. The resulting picture agrees\nwith previous experimental evidence for multiple carriers at low temperatures,\nbut the exact Fermi surface shape differs from predictions, suggesting that\ncorrelations play a role in deviation from ab initio theory and cause up to a\nfour-fold enhancement in the effective carrier mass.\n", "  A stochastic model of excitatory and inhibitory interactions which bears\nuniversality traits is introduced and studied. The endogenous component of\nnoise, stemming from finite size corrections, drives robust inter-nodes\ncorrelations, that persist at large large distances. Anti-phase synchrony at\nsmall frequencies is resolved on adjacent nodes and found to promote the\nspontaneous generation of long-ranged stochastic patterns, that invade the\nnetwork as a whole. These patterns are lacking under the idealized\ndeterministic scenario, and could provide novel hints on how living systems\nimplement and handle a large gallery of delicate computational tasks.\n", "  We extract constraints on the parameter space of the MW model by comparing\nthe cross-sections for dijet, top-pair, dijet-pair, $t\\bar t t \\bar t$ and\n$b\\bar b b \\bar b$ productions at the LHC with the strongest available\nexperimental limits from ATLAS or CMS at 8 or 13 TeV. Overall we find that\nmasses below 1 TeV have not been excluded for color octet scalars as it is\noften claimed in the literature. The constraints that can be placed on coupling\nconstants are typically weaker than those from existing theoretical\nconsiderations, with the exception of the parameter $\\eta_D$.\n", "  We study theoretically the single-electron triangular zigzag graphene quantum\ndot in three typical in-plane electric fields. The far-infrared absorption\nspectra of the dot are calculated by the tight-binding method and then the\noptical selection rules are identified by contrast with the corresponding\nenergy spectra. Our result shows that there exist the remarkable optical\nselection rules due to the C3 symmetry of the dot. When the electric field\npossesses also the C3 symmetry, there are only two absorption peaks in the\nabsorption spectra. As the C3 symmetry of the system is damaged by the electric\nfields, both the intensity of the strongest peak and the number of the\nforbidden transitions decrease gradually. Moreover, the polarization causes the\ndecrease of the peak intensities and even new forbidden transitions. Our\nfindings may be useful for the application of graphene quantum dots to\nelectronic and optoelectronic devices.\n", "  We establish various general results concerning static and spherically\nsymmetric black hole solutions of general higher-derivative extensions of\nEinstein gravity. We prove that the only theories susceptible of admitting\nsolutions with $g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$ and representing the exterior field of a\nspherically symmetric distribution of mass are those that only propagate a\nmassless and traceless graviton on the vacuum. Then, we provide a simple (and\ncomputationally powerful) sufficient condition for a theory to admit solutions\nof that kind, as well as a systematic way for constructing them for a given\ntheory. We conjecture (and provide strong evidence) that all black holes\nconstructed according to our criteria are completely determined by their mass\n(non-hairy), and such that their thermodynamic properties can be obtained by\nsolving a system of algebraic equations without free parameters. Our results\ncan be straightforwardly extended to planar and hyperbolic horizons. We\nillustrate this by obtaining new planar asymptotically $AdS_5$ black hole\nsolutions of the recently constructed Generalized quasitopological gravity\n[arXiv:1703.01631], which belongs to the class of theories selected by our\nresults.\n", "  When a magnetic field is applied, the mixed state of a conventional Type II\nsuperconductor gets destroyed at the upper critical field Hc2, where the normal\nvortex cores overlap with each other. Here, we show that in the presence weak\nand homogeneous disorder the destruction of superconductivity with field\nfollows a different route. Starting with a weakly disordered NbN thin film ( Tc\n~ 9K ), we show that under the application of magnetic field the\nsuperconducting state becomes increasingly granular, where lines of vortices\nseparate the superconducting islands. Consequently, phase fluctuations between\nthese islands give rise to a field induced pseudogap phase, which has a gap in\nthe electronic density of states but where the global zero resistance state is\ndestroyed.\n", "  We present results for the interaction of two kaons at maximal isospin. The\ncalculation is based on $N_f=2+1+1$ flavour gauge configurations generated by\nthe European Twisted Mass Collaboration with pion masses ranging from about\n$230$ to $450\\,\\textrm{MeV}$ at three values of the lattice spacing. The\nelastic scattering length $a_0^{I=1}$ is calculated at several values of the\nbare strange and light quark masses. We find $M_K a_0 =\n-0.385(16)_{\\textrm{stat}} (^{+0}_{-12})_{m_s}(^{+0}_{-5})_{Z_P}(4)_{r_f}$ as\nthe result of a combined extrapolation to the continuum and to the physical\npoint, where the first error is statistical, and the three following are\nsystematical. This translates to $a_0 =\n-0.154(6)_{\\textrm{stat}}(^{+0}_{-5})_{m_s}\n(^{+0}_{-2})_{Z_P}(2)_{r_f}\\,\\textrm{fm}$.\n", "  We present NN potentials through five orders of chiral effective field theory\nranging from leading order (LO) to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading\norder (N4LO). The construction may be perceived as consistent in the sense that\nthe same power counting scheme as well as the same cutoff procedures are\napplied in all orders. Moreover, the long-range parts of these potentials are\nfixed by the very accurate pi-N LECs as determined in the Roy-Steiner equations\nanalysis by Hoferichter, Ruiz de Elvira and coworkers. In fact, the\nuncertainties of these LECs are so small that a variation within the errors\nleads to effects that are essentially negligible, reducing the error budget of\npredictions considerably. The NN potentials are fit to the world NN data below\npion-production threshold of the year of 2016.\n  The potential of the highest order (N4LO) reproduces the world NN data with\nthe outstanding chi^2/datum of 1.15, which is the highest precision ever\naccomplished for any chiral NN potential to date. The NN potentials presented\nmay serve as a solid basis for systematic ab initio calculations of nuclear\nstructure and reactions that allow for a comprehensive error analysis. In\nparticular, the consistent order by order development of the potentials will\nmake possible a reliable determination of the truncation error at each order.\nOur family of potentials is non-local and, generally, of soft character. This\nfeature is reflected in the fact that the predictions for the triton binding\nenergy (from two-body forces only) converges to about 8.1 MeV at the highest\norders. This leaves room for three-nucleon-force contributions of moderate\nsize.\n", "  Aims. We aim to show how encounters with low-mass satellite galaxies may\nalter the bar formation in a Milky Way-like disc galaxy. Methods. We use\nhigh-resolution N-body simulations of a disc galaxy prone to mild bar\ninstability. For realistic initial conditions of satellites, we take advantage\nof cosmological simulations of Milky Way-like dark matter haloes. Results. The\nsatellites may have a significant impact on the time of bar formation. Some\nruns with satellites demonstrate a delay, while others show an advancement in\nbar formation compared to the isolated run, with such time differences reaching\n$\\sim$ 1 Gyr. Meanwhile, the final bar configuration, including its very\nappearance and the bar characteristics such as the pattern speed and the\nexponential growth rate of its amplitude are independent of the number of\nencounters and their orbits. The contribution of satellites with masses below\n$10^9 M_{\\odot}$ is insignificant, unless their pericentre distances are small.\nWe suggest that the encounters act indirectly via inducing perturbations across\nthe disc that evolve to delayed waves in the central part and interfere with an\nemerging seed bar. The predicted effect for the present-day host galaxy is\nexpected to be even more significant at redshifts $z \\gtrsim 0.5$.\n", "  Storing and accessing information in atomic-scale magnets requires magnetic\nimaging techniques with single-atom resolution. Here, we show simultaneous\ndetection of the spin-polarization and exchange force, with or without the flow\nof current, with a new method, which combines scanning tunneling microscopy and\nnon-contact atomic force microscopy. To demonstrate the application of this new\nmethod, we characterize the prototypical nano-skyrmion lattice formed on a\nmonolayer of Fe/Ir(111). We resolve the square magnetic lattice by employing\nmagnetic exchange force microscopy, demonstrating its applicability to\nnon-collinear magnetic structures, for the first time. Utilizing\ndistance-dependent force and current spectroscopy, we quantify the exchange\nforces in comparison to the spin-polarization. For strongly spin-polarized\ntips, we distinguish different signs of the exchange force which we suggest\narises from a change in exchange mechanisms between the probe and a skyrmion.\nThis new approach may enable both non-perturbative readout combined with\nwriting by current-driven reversal of atomic-scale magnets.\n", "  A scheme is presented for engineering momentum-space entanglement of\nfragmented magnon condensates. We consider easy plane frustrated\nantiferromagnets in which the magnon dispersion has degenerate minima that\nrepresent umbrella chiral spin textures. With an applied magnetic field, we\ntune the Hamiltonian near a quantum critical point that is is signaled by a\nsingularity in the entanglement entropy. The ground state develops\nmomentum-space entanglement of the chiral spin textures. The size of the\nentangled superposition is accessible experimentally through the magnetic\nstructure factor. Our model is motivated by equilibrium magnon condensates in\nfrustrated antiferromagnets such as CsCuCl3, and it can also be simulated in\nspin-orbit coupled Mott insulators in atomic optical lattices and circuit\nquantum electrodynamics.\n", "  I propose an alternative $f(R)$ theory of gravity constructed by applying the\nfunction $f$ directly to the Ricci tensor instead of the Ricci scalar. The main\ngoal of this study is to derive the resulting modified Einstein equations for\nthe metric case with Levi-Civita connection, as well as for the general\nnonmetric connection with torsion. The modification is then applied to the\nRobertson-Walker metric so that the cosmological evolution corresponding to the\nstandard model can be studied. An appealing feature is that even in the vacuum\ncase, scenarios without initial singularity and exponential expansion can be\nrecovered. Finally, formulae for possible observational tests are given.\n", "  Screening due to surrounding dielectric medium reshapes the electron-hole\ninteraction potential and plays a pivotal role in deciding the binding energies\nof strongly bound exciton complexes in quantum confined monolayers of\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, owing to strong\nquasi-particle bandgap renormalization in such systems, a direct quantification\nof estimated shifts in binding energy in different dielectric media remains\nelusive using optical studies. In this work, by changing the dielectric\nenvironment, we show a conspicuous photoluminescence (PL) peak shift at low\ntemperature for higher energy excitons (2s, 3s, 4s, 5s) in monolayer MoSe$_2$,\nwhile the 1s exciton peak position remains unaltered - a direct evidence of\nvarying compensation between screening induced exciton binding energy\nmodulation and quasi-particle bandgap renormalization. The estimated modulation\nof binding energy for the 1s exciton is found to be 58.6% (70.5% for 2s, 78.9%\nfor 3s, 85% for 4s) by coating an Al$_2$O$_3$ layer on top, while the\ncorresponding reduction in quasi-particle bandgap is estimated to be 248 meV.\nSuch a direct evidence of large tunability of the binding energy of exciton\ncomplexes as well as the bandgap in monolayer TMDs holds promise of novel\ndevice applications.\n", "  We present results of the numerical simulations and the scaling\ncharacteristics of one-dimensional random fluctuations with heavy tailed\nprobability distribution functions. Assuming that the distribution function of\nthe random fluctuations obeys L\\'evy statistics with a power-law scaling\nexponent, we investigate the fractional diffusion equation in the presence of\n$\\mu$-stable L\\'evy noise. e study the scaling properties of the global width\nand two point correlation functions, we then compare the analytical and\nnumerical results for the growth exponent $\\beta$ and the roughness exponent\n$\\alpha$. We also investigate the fractional Fokker-Planck equation for\nheavy-tailed random fluctuations. We show that the fractional diffusion\nprocesses in the presence of $\\mu$-stable L\\'evy noise display special scaling\nproperties in the probability distribution function (PDF). Finally, we study\nnumerically the scaling properties of the heavy-tailed random fluctuations by\nusing the diffusion entropy analysis. This method is based on the evaluation of\nthe Shannon entropy of the PDF generated by the random fluctuations, rather\nthan on the measurement of the global width of the process. We apply the\ndiffusion entropy analysis to extract the growth exponent $\\beta$ and to\nconfirm the validity of our numerical analysis. The proposed fractional\nlangevin equation can be used for modeling, analysis and characterization of\nexperimental data, such as solar flare fluctuations, turbulent heat flow and\netc.\n", "  We report time and angle resolved spectroscopic measurements in optimally\ndoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$. The spectral function is monitored as\na function of temperature, photoexcitation density and delay time from the pump\npulse. According to our data, the superconducting gap becomes slightly stiffer\nwhen moving off the nodal direction. The nodal quasiparticles develop a faster\ndynamics when pumping the superconductor with a fluence that is large enough to\ninduce the total collapse of the gap. We discuss the observed relaxation in\nterms of a dynamical reformation of Cooper pairs.\n", "  We discuss nuclear physics in the Sakai-Sugimoto model in the limit of large\nnumber $N_c$ of colors and large 't Hooft coupling $\\lambda$. In this limit the\nindividual baryons are described by classical solitons whose size is much\nsmaller than the typical distance at which they settle in a nuclear bound\nstate. We can thus use the linear approximation outside the instanton cores to\ncompute the interaction potential. We find the classical geometry of nuclear\nbound states for baryon number up to eight. One of the interesting features\nthat we find is that holographic nuclear physics provides a natural description\nfor lightly bound states when $\\lambda$ is large. For the case of two nuclei,\nwe also find the topology and metric of the manifold of zero modes and,\nquantizing it, we find that the ground state can be identified with the\ndeuteron state. We discuss the relations with other methods in the literature\nused to study Skyrmions and holographic nuclear physics. We discuss $1/{N_c}$\nand $1/\\lambda$ corrections and the challenges to overcome to reach the\nphenomenological values to fit with real QCD.\n", "  Identifying heterogeneous structures in glasses --- such as localized soft\nspots --- and understanding structure-dynamics relations in these systems\nremain major scientific challenges. Here we derive an exact expression for the\nlocal thermal energy of interacting particles (the mean local potential energy\nchange due to thermal fluctuations) in glassy systems by a systematic\nlow-temperature expansion. We show that the local thermal energy can attain\nanomalously large values, inversely related to the degree of softness of\nlocalized structures in a glass, determined by a coupling between internal\nstresses --- an intrinsic signature of glassy frustration ---, anharmonicity\nand low-frequency vibrational modes. These anomalously large values follow a\nfat-tailed distribution, with a universal exponent related to the recently\nobserved universal $\\omega^4$ density of states of quasi-localized\nlow-frequency vibrational modes. When the spatial thermal energy field --- a\n`softness field' --- is considered, this power-law tail manifests itself by\nhighly localized spots which are significantly softer than their surroundings.\nThese soft spots are shown to be susceptible to plastic rearrangements under\nexternal driving forces, having predictive powers that surpass those of the\nnormal-modes-based approach. These results offer a general,\nsystem/model-independent, physical-observable-based approach to identify\nstructural properties of quiescent glasses and to relate them to glassy\ndynamics.\n", "  The impact of non-equilibrium effects on the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions\nis investigated by comparing a non-equilibrium transport approach, the\nParton-Hadron-String-Dynamics (PHSD), to a 2D+1 viscous hydrodynamical model,\nwhich is based on the assumption of local equilibrium and conservation laws.\nStarting the hydrodynamical model from the same non-equilibrium initial\ncondition as in the PHSD, using an equivalent lQCD Equation-of-State (EoS), the\nsame transport coefficients, i.e. shear viscosity $\\eta$ and the bulk viscosity\n$\\zeta$ in the hydrodynamical model, we compare the time evolution of the\nsystem in terms of energy density, Fourier transformed energy density, spatial\nand momentum eccentricities and ellipticity in order to quantify the traces of\nnon-equilibrium phenomena. In addition, we also investigate the role of initial\npre-equilibrium flow on the hydrodynamical evolution and demonstrate its\nimportance for final state observables. We find that due to non-equilibrium\neffects, the event-by-event transport calculations show large fluctuations in\nthe collective properties, while ensemble averaged observables are close to the\nhydrodynamical results.\n", "  We formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a\npair of maximally incompatible two-outcome measurements in a finite dimensional\nGeneral Probabilistic Theory. The conditions are on the geometry of the state\nspace, they require existence of two pairs of parallel exposed faces with\nadditional condition on their intersections. We introduce the notion of\ndiscrimination measurement and show that the conditions for a pair of\ntwo-outcome measurements to be maximally incompatible are equivalent to\nrequiring that a (potential, yet non-existing) joint measurement of the\nmaximally incompatible measurements would have to discriminate affinely\ndependent points. We present several examples to demonstrate our results.\n", "  This Letter reports a generalized theory of the smallest diameter of metallic\nnanorods from physical vapor deposition. The generalization incorporates the\neffects of nanorod separation and those of van der Waals interactions on\ngeometrical shadowing. In contrast, the previous theory for idealized\ngeometrical shadowing [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 136102 (2013)] does not include\nany dependence on nanorod separation and it predicts the diameter to be about\nto of what the generalized theory does. As verification, numerical solutions\nand the generalized theory in closed-form agree in terms of effective\ndeposition flux. As validation, experiments of physical vapor deposition and\nthe generalized theory agree in terms of the diameter as a function of the\nseparation of nanorods.\n", "  A small polarizable object (an atom, molecule or nanoparticle), placed above\na medium with flowing dc current in it, is considered. It is shown that the dc\ncurrent can have a strong effect on the force exerted on the particle. The\nCasimir-Lifshitz force, well studied in the absence of current, gets modified\ndue to drifting mobile carriers in the medium. Furthermore, a force in the\nlateral direction appears. This force is a non-monotonic function of the drift\nvelocity and its maximal value is comparable with the Casimir-Lifshitz force.\nIf the temperatures of the medium and the particle are different, this lateral\nforce can be directed along the current (drag) or in the opposite direction\n(anti-drag).\n", "  While traditionally associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN), the\nproperties of the CII] ($\\lambda=2326$\\,{\\AA}), CIII]\n($\\lambda,\\lambda=1907,1909$\\,{\\AA}) and CIV ($\\lambda,\\lambda=1549,\n1551$\\,{\\AA}) emission lines are still uncertain as large, unbiased samples of\nsources are scarce. We present the first blind, statistical study of CII],\nCIII] and CIV emitters at $z\\sim0.68,1.05,1.53$, respectively, uniformly\nselected down to a flux limit of $\\sim4\\times10^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$\nthrough a narrow band survey covering an area of $\\sim1.4$ deg$^2$ over COSMOS\nand UDS. We detect 16 CII], 35 CIII] and 17 CIV emitters, whose nature we\ninvestigate using optical colours as well as HST, X-ray, radio and far\ninfra-red data. We find that $z\\sim0.7$ CII] emitters are consistent with a\nmixture of blue (UV slope $\\beta=-2.0\\pm0.4$) star forming galaxies with disky\nHST structure and AGN with Seyfert-like morphologies. Bright CII] emitters have\nindividual X-ray detections as well as high average black hole accretion rates\n(BHAR) of $\\sim0.1$ $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. CIII] emitters at $z\\sim1.05$ trace\na general population of SF galaxies, with $\\beta=-0.8\\pm1.1$, a variety of\noptical morphologies, including isolated and interacting galaxies and low BHAR\n($<0.02$ $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). Our CIV emitters at $z\\sim1.5$ are consistent\nwith young, blue quasars ($\\beta\\sim-1.9$) with point-like optical\nmorphologies, bright X-ray counterparts and large BHAR ($0.8$ $M_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$). We also find some surprising CII], CIII] and CIV emitters with\nrest-frame equivalent widths which could be as large as $50-100$ {\\AA}. AGN or\nspatial offsets between the UV continuum stellar disk and the line emitting\nregions may explain the large EW. These bright CII], CIII] and CIV emitters are\nideal candidates for spectroscopic follow up to fully unveil their nature.\n", "  Galaxy evolution and star formation are two multi-scale problems tightly\nlinked to each other. To understand the interstellar cycle, which triggers\ngalaxy evolution, it is necessary to describe simultaneously the large-scale\nevolution widely induced by the feedback processes and the details of the gas\ndynamics that controls the star formation process through gravitational\ncollapse. We perform a set of three-dimensional high-resolution numerical\nsimulations of a turbulent, self-gravitating and magnetized interstellar medium\nwithin a $1\\ \\mathrm{kpc}$ stratified box with supernova feedback correlated\nwith star-forming regions. In particular, we focus on the role played by the\nmagnetic field and the feedback on the galactic vertical structure, the star\nformation rate (SFR) and the flow dynamics. For this purpose we vary their\nrespective intensities. We extract properties of the dense clouds arising from\nthe turbulent motions and compute power spectra of various quantities. Using a\ndistribution of supernovae sufficiently correlated with the dense gas, we find\nthat supernova explosions can reproduce the observed SFR, particularly if the\nmagnetic field is on the order of a few $\\mu G$. The vertical structure, which\nresults from a dynamical and an energy equilibrium is well reproduced by a\nsimple analytical model, which allows us to estimate the coupling between the\ngas and the supernovae. We found the coupling to be rather low and on the order\nof 1.5$\\%$. Strong magnetic fields may help to increase this coupling by a\nfactor of about 2-3. To characterize the flow we compute the power spectra of\nvarious quantities in 3D but also in 2D in order to account for the\nstratification of the galactic disc.\n", "  When rough grains in standard packing conditions are discharged from a silo,\na conical depression with a single slope is formed at the surface. We observed\nthat the increase of the volume fraction generates a more complex depression\ncharacterized by two angles of discharge: a lower angle close to the one\nmeasured for standard packing and a considerably larger upper angle. The change\nin slope appears at the boundary between a densely packed stagnant region at\nthe periphery and the central flowing channel formed over the aperture. Since\nthe material in the latter zone is always fluidized, the flow rate is\nunaffected by the initial packing of the bed. On the other hand, the contrast\nbetween both angles is markedly smaller when smooth particles of the same size\nand density are used, which reveals that high volume fraction and friction must\ncombine to produce the observed geometry. Our results show that the surface\nprofile helps to identify by simple visual inspection the packing conditions of\na granular bed, and this can be useful to prevent undesirable collapses during\nsilo discharge in industry.\n", "  The $p_\\perp$ dependence of the nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm AA}$\nmeasured in PbPb collisions at the LHC exhibits a universal shape, which can be\nvery well reproduced in a simple energy loss model based on the BDMPS\nmedium-induced gluon spectrum. The scaling is observed for various hadron\nspecies ($h^\\pm$, $D$, $J/\\psi$) in different centrality classes and at both\ncolliding energies, $\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV. Results\nindicate an 10-20% increase of the transport coefficient from $\\sqrt{s}=2.76$\nTeV to $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV, consistent with that of particle multiplicity.\nBased on this model, a data-driven procedure is suggested, which allows for the\ndetermination of the first and second moments of the quenching weight without\nany prior knowledge of the latter.\n", "  We introduce the Cluster-EAGLE (C-EAGLE) simulation project, a set of\ncosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations of the formation of $30$ galaxy\nclusters in the mass range $10^{14}<M_{200}/\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}<10^{15.4}$ that\nincorporates the Hydrangea sample of Bah\\'e et al. (2017). The simulations\nadopt the state-of-the-art EAGLE galaxy formation model, with a gas particle\nmass of $1.8\\times10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and physical softening length of\n$0.7\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$. In this paper, we introduce the sample and present the\nlow-redshift global properties of the clusters. We calculate the X-ray\nproperties in a manner consistent with observational techniques, demonstrating\nthe bias and scatter introduced by using estimated masses. We find the total\nstellar content and black hole masses of the clusters to be in good agreement\nwith the observed relations. However, the clusters are too gas rich, suggesting\nthat the AGN feedback model is not efficient enough at expelling gas from the\nhigh-redshift progenitors of the clusters. The X-ray properties, such as the\nspectroscopic temperature and the soft-band luminosity, and the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich properties are in reasonable agreement with the observed\nrelations. However, the clusters have too high central temperatures and\nlarger-than-observed entropy cores, which is likely driven by the AGN feedback\nafter the cluster core has formed. The total metal content and its distribution\nthroughout the ICM are a good match to the observations.\n", "  We consider propagation of high energy earth-skimming taus produced in\ninteractions of astrophysical tau neutrinos. For astrophysical tau neutrinos we\ntake generic power-law flux, $E^{-2}$ and the cosmogenic flux initiated by the\nprotons. We calculate tau energy loss in several approaches, such as dipole\nmodels and the phenomenological approach in which parameterization of the $F_2$\nis used. We evaluate the tau neutrino charged-current cross section using the\nsame approaches for consistency. We find that uncertainty in the neutrino cross\nsection and in the tau energy loss partially compensate giving very small\ntheoretical uncertainty in the emerging tau flux for distances ranging from $2$\nkm to $100$ km and for the energy range between $10^6$ GeV and $10^{11}$ GeV,\nfocusing on energies above $10^8$ GeV. When we consider uncertainties in the\nneutrino cross section, inelasticity in neutrino interactions and the tau\nenergy loss, which are not correlated, i.e. they are not all calculated in the\nsame approach, theoretical uncertainty ranges from about $30\\%$ and $60 \\%$ at\n$10^8$ GeV to about factors of 3.3 and 3.8 at $10^{11}$ GeV for the $E^{-2}$\nflux and the cosmogenic flux, respectively, for the distance of 10 km rock. The\nspread in predictions significantly increases for much larger distances, e.g.,\n$\\sim 1,000$ km. Most of the uncertainty comes from the treatment of\nphotonuclear interactions of the tau in transit through large distances. We\nalso consider Monte Carlo calculation of the tau propagation and we find that\nthe result for the emerging tau flux is in agreement with the result obtained\nusing analytic approach. Our results are relevant to several experiments that\nare looking for skimming astrophysical taus, such as the Pierre Auger\nObservatory, HAWC and Ashra. We evaluate the aperture for the Auger and discuss\nbriefly application to the the other two experiments.\n", "  We describe dynamical symmetry breaking in a system of massless Dirac\nfermions with both electromagnetic and four-fermion interactions in (2+1)\ndimensions. The former is described by the Pseudo Quantum Electrodynamics\n(PQED) and the latter is given by the so-called Gross-Neveu action. We apply\nthe Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and the large$-N_f$ expansion in our\nmodel to obtain a Yukawa action. Thereafter, the presence of a symmetry broken\nphase is inferred from the non-perturbative Schwinger-Dyson equation for the\nelectron propagator. This is the physical solution whenever the fine-structure\nconstant is larger than a critical value $\\alpha_c(D N_f)$. In particular, we\nobtain the critical coupling constant $\\alpha_c\\approx 0.36$ for $D N_f=8$.,\nwhere $D=2,4$ corresponds to the SU(2) and SU(4) cases, respectively, and $N_f$\nis the flavor number. Our results show a decreasing of the critical coupling\nconstant in comparison with the case of pure electromagnetic interaction, thus\nyielding a more favorable scenario for the occurrence of dynamical symmetry\nbreaking. For two-dimensional materials,in application in condensed matter\nsystems, it implies an energy gap at the Dirac points or valleys of the\nhoneycomb lattice.\n", "  We present highlights from a large set of simulations of a hot Jupiter\natmosphere, nominally based on HD 209458b, aimed at exploring both the\nevolution of the deep atmosphere, and the acceleration of the zonal flow or\njet. We find the occurrence of a super-rotating equatorial jet is robust to\nchanges in various parameters, and over long timescales, even in the absence of\nstrong inner or bottom boundary drag. This jet is diminished in one simulation\nonly, where we strongly force the deep atmosphere equator-to-pole temperature\ngradient over long timescales. Finally, although the eddy momentum fluxes in\nour atmosphere show similarities with the proposed mechanism for accelerating\njets on tidally-locked planets, the picture appears more complex. We present\ntentative evidence for a jet driven by a combination of eddy momentum transport\nand mean flow.\n", "  We show that two parties far apart can use shared entangled states and\nclassical communication to align their coordinate systems with a very high\nfidelity. Moreover compared with previous methods proposed for such a task,\ni.e. sending parallel or anti-parallel pairs or groups of spin states, our\nmethod has the extra advantages of using single qubit measurements and also\nbeing secure, so that third parties do not extract any information about the\naligned coordinate system established between the two parties. The latter\nproperty is important in many other quantum information protocols in which\nmeasurements inevitably play a significant role.\n", "  We theoretically investigate how each orbital and valley play a role for high\nthermoelectric performance of SnSe. In the hole-doped regime, two kinds of\nvalence band valleys contribute to its transport properties: one is the valley\nnear the U-Z line, mainly consisting of the Se-$p_z$ orbitals, and the other is\nthe one along the $\\Gamma$-Y line, mainly consisting of the Se-$p_y$ orbitals.\nWhereas the former valley plays a major role in determining the transport\nproperties at room temperature, the latter one also offers comparable\ncontribution and so the band structure exhibits multi-valley character by\nincreasing the temperature. In the electron-doped regime, the conduction band\nvalley around the $\\Gamma$ point solely contributes to the thermoelectric\nperformance, where the quasi-one-dimensional electronic structure along the\n$a$-axis is crucial. This study provides an important knowledge for the\nthermoelectric properties of SnSe, and will be useful for future search of\nhigh-performance thermoelectric materials.\n", "  The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in FeSe/STO has trigged\ngreat research interest to reveal a range of exotic physical phenomena in this\nnovel material. Here we present a temperature dependent magnetotransport\nmeasurement for ultrathin FeSe/STO films with different thickness and\nprotection layers. Remarkably, a surprising linear magnetoresistance (LMR) is\nobserved around the superconducting transition temperatures but absent\notherwise. The experimental LMR can be reproduced by magnetotransport\ncalculations based on a model of magnetic field dependent disorder induced by\nspin fluctuation. Thus, the observed LMR in coexistence with superconductivity\nprovides the first magnetotransport signature for spin fluctuation around the\nsuperconducting transition region in ultrathin FeSe/STO films.\n", "  We study the question about existence i.e. stability with respect to\ndissociation of the spin-quartet, permutation- and reflection-symmetric\n${}^4(-3)^+_g$ ($S_z=-3/2, M=-3$) state of the $(\\alpha\\alpha e e e)$ Coulomb\nsystem: the ${\\rm He}_2^+$ molecular ion, placed in a magnetic field $0 \\le B\n\\le 10000$ a.u. We assume that the $\\alpha$-particles are infinitely massive\n(Born-Oppenheimer approximation of zero order) and adopt the parallel\nconfiguration, when the molecular axis and the magnetic field direction\ncoincide, as the optimal configuration. The study of the stability is performed\nvariationally with a physically adequate trial function. To achieve this goal,\nwe explore several Helium-contained compounds in strong magnetic fields, in\nparticular, we study the spin-quartet ground state of ${\\rm He}^-$ ion, and the\nground (spin-triplet) state of the Helium atom, both for a magnetic field in\n$100 \\leq B\\leq 10000$ a.u. The main result is that the ${\\rm He}_2^+$\nmolecular ion in the state ${}^4(-3)^+_g$ is stable towards all possible decay\nmodes for magnetic fields $B \\gtrsim 120$ a.u. and with the magnetic field\nincrease the ion becomes more tightly bound and compact with a cigar-type form\nof electronic cloud. At $B=1000$ a.u., the dissociation energy of ${\\rm\nHe}_2^+$ into ${\\rm He}^- + \\alpha$ is $\\sim 701.8$ eV and the dissociation\nenergy for the decay channel to ${\\rm He} + \\alpha + e $ is $\\sim 729.1$ eV,\nlatter both energies are in the energy window for one of the observed\nabsorption features of the isolated neutron star 1E1207.4-5209.\n", "  Recently, the CIII] and CIV emission lines have been observed in galaxies in\nthe early Universe ($z>5$), providing new ways to measure their redshift and\nstudy their stellar populations and AGN. We explore the first blind CII], CIII]\nand CIV survey ($z\\sim0.68, 1.05, 1.53$, respectively) presented in Stroe et\nal. (2017). We derive luminosity functions (LF) and study properties of CII],\nCIII] and CIV line emitters through comparisons to the LFs of H$\\alpha$ and\nLy$\\alpha$ emitters, UV selected star forming (SF) galaxies and quasars at\nsimilar redshifts. The CII] LF at $z\\sim0.68$ is equally well described by a\nSchechter or a power-law LF, characteristic of a mixture of SF and AGN\nactivity. The CIII] LF ($z\\sim1.05$) is consistent to a scaled down version of\nthe Schechter H$\\alpha$ and Ly$\\alpha$ LF at their redshift, indicating a SF\norigin. In stark contrast, the CIV LF at $z\\sim1.53$ is well fit by a\npower-law, quasar-like LF. We find that the brightest UV sources ($M_{UV}<-22$)\nwill universally have CIII] and CIV emission. However, on average, CIII] and\nCIV are not as abundant as H$\\alpha$ or Ly$\\alpha$ emitters at the same\nredshift, with cosmic average ratios of $\\sim0.02-0.06$ to H$\\alpha$ and\n$\\sim0.01-0.1$ to intrinsic Ly$\\alpha$. We predict that the CIII] and CIV lines\ncan only be truly competitive in confirming high redshift candidates when the\nhosts are intrinsically bright and the effective Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction is\nbelow 1 per cent. While CIII] and CIV were proposed as good tracers of young,\nrelatively low-metallicity galaxies typical of the early Universe, we find\nthat, at least at $z\\sim1.5$, CIV is exclusively hosted by AGN/quasars,\nespecially at large line equivalent widths.\n", "  We study the growth of entanglement entropy in density matrix renormalization\ngroup calculations of the real-time quench dynamics of the Anderson impurity\nmodel. We find that with appropriate choice of basis, the entropy growth is\nlogarithmic in both the interacting and noninteracting single-impurity models.\nThe logarithmic entropy growth is understood from a noninteracting chain model\nas a critical behavior separating regimes of linear growth and saturation of\nentropy, corresponding respectively to an overlapping and gapped energy spectra\nof the set of bath states. We find that with an appropriate choices of basis\n(energy-ordered bath orbitals), logarithmic entropy growth is the generic\nbehavior of quenched impurity models. A noninteracting calculation of a\ndouble-impurity Anderson model supports the conclusion in the multi-impurity\ncase. The logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy enables studies of quench\ndynamics to very long times.\n", "  We study the zero temperature phase diagram of an imbalanced bilayer of\ndipolar fermions. We consider perpendicularly aligned identical dipoles in two\nlayers and investigate the effect of population imbalance on the ground state\nphase at different layer spacings and average densities. The attractive part of\nthe interlayer interaction could lead to the BEC-BCS crossover and the Fermi\nsurface mismatch between two layers results in interesting uniform and\nnonuniform superfluid phases, which we have investigated here using the BCS\nmean-field theory together with the superfluid-mass density criterion. The\ndensity imbalance reduces the pairing gap. At low densities, where the system\nis on the BEC side of the crossover, this reduction is quite smooth while a\ndense system rapidly becomes normal at intermediate density polarizations.\nStable homogeneous superfluidity is predicted to appear on the phase diagram\nwhen the dipolar length exceeds both the layer spacing and the average\nintralayer distance between dipoles, a regime which should be readily\naccessible experimentally. This homogeneous superfluid phase becomes unstable\nat intermediate densities and layer spacings. We have also examined that these\nuniform and inhomogeneous superfluid phases survive when the effects of\nintralayer screenings are also incorporated in the formalism.\n", "  We study spin transport in a fully hBN encapsulated monolayer-graphene van\nder Waals (vdW) heterostructure, at room temperature. A top-layer of\nbilayer-hBN is used as a tunnel barrier for spin-injection and detection in\ngraphene with ferromagnetic cobalt electrodes. We report surprisingly large and\nbias induced (differential) spin-injection (detection) polarizations up to 50%\n(135%) at a positive voltage bias of +0.6 V, as well as sign inverted\npolarizations up to -70% (-60%) at a reverse bias of -0.4 V. This demonstrates\nthe potential of bilayer-hBN tunnel barriers for practical graphene spintronics\napplications. With such enhanced spin-injection and detection polarizations, we\nreport a record two-terminal (inverted) spin-valve signals up to 800 $\\Omega$\nwith a magnetoresistance ratio of 2.7%, and we achieve spin accumulations up to\n4.1 meV. We propose how these numbers can be increased further, for future\ntechnologically relevant graphene based spintronic devices.\n", "  We present a detailed study of a confined circular flare dynamics associated\nwith 3 UV late phases in order to understand more precisely which topological\nelements are present and how they constrain the dynamics of the flare. We\nperform a non-linear force free field extrapolation of the confined flare\nobserved with the HMI and AIA instruments onboard SDO. From the 3D magnetic\nfield we compute the squashing factor and we analyse its distribution.\nConjointly, we analyse the AIA EUV light curves and images in order to identify\nthe post-flare loops, their temporal and thermal evolution. By combining both\nanalysis we are able to propose a detailed scenario that explains the dynamics\nof the flare. Our topological analysis shows that in addition to a null-point\ntopology with the fan separatrix, the spine lines and its surrounding\nQuasi-Separatix Layers halo (typical for a circular flare), a flux rope and its\nhyperbolic flux tube (HFT) are enclosed below the null. By comparing the\nmagnetic field topology and the EUV post-flare loops we obtain an almost\nperfect match 1) between the footpoints of the separatrices and the EUV\n1600~\\AA{} ribbons and 2) between the HFT's field line footpoints and bright\nspots observed inside the circular ribbons. We showed, for the first time in a\nconfined flare, that magnetic reconnection occured initially at the HFT, below\nthe flux rope. Reconnection at the null point between the flux rope and the\noverlying field is only initiated in a second phase. In addition, we showed\nthat the EUV late phase observed after the main flare episode are caused by the\ncooling loops of different length which have all reconnected at the null point\nduring the impulsive phase.\n", "  Many arguments against quartic propagators, negative norm states and related\neffects concern the sicknesses which occur when the spectrum of the free\nparticle Hamiltonian is formed. However, if the theory is more complicated, for\nexample involving confinement such that the particle in question does not\nappear in the physical spectrum, those considerations do not apply directly.\nPath integral methods suggest that some of these may be acceptable theories. I\nprovide an example that should be able to be simulated on a lattice which then\nallows a non-perturbative resolution of this question. In its SU(2) version it\ninvolves a scalar triplet with a quartic derivative Lagrangian coupled to the\nSU(2) gauge field. If this is verified to be a healthy theory, it could open\nnew avenues in model building. I also discuss how strong interactions can\ndynamically modify the dispersion relation leaving a healthy effective field\ntheory, using conformal gravity coupled to a Yang-Mills theory as an example.\nSuch a theory could possibly form a UV completion for quantum gravity.\n", "  Hidden sector glueball dark matter is well motivated by string theory,\ncompactifications of which often have extra gauge groups uncoupled to the\nvisible sector. We study the dynamics of glueballs in theories with a period of\nlate time primordial matter domination followed by a low final reheating\ntemperature due to a gravitationally coupled modulus. Compared to scenarios\nwith a high reheating temperature, the required relic abundance is possible\nwith higher hidden sector confinement scales, and less extreme differences in\nthe entropy densities of the hidden and visible sectors. Both of these can\noccur in string derived models, and relatively light moduli are helpful for\nobtaining viable phenomenology. We also study the effects of hidden sector\ngluinos. In some parts of parameter space these can be the dominant dark matter\ncomponent, while in others their abundance is much smaller than that of\nglueballs. Finally, we show that heavy glueballs produced from energy in the\nhidden sector prior to matter domination can have the correct relic abundance\nif they are sufficiently long lived.\n", "  We perform the first study of holographic heat engines where the working\nmaterial is a rotating black hole, obtaining exact results for the efficiency\nof a rectangular engine cycle. We also make general considerations in the\ncontext of benchmarking these engines on circular cycles. We find an exact\nexpression that is valid for black holes with vanishing specific heat at\nconstant volume and derive an upper bound, below the Carnot efficiency and\nindependent of spacetime dimension, which holds for any black hole of this\nkind. We illustrate our results with applications to a variety of black holes,\nnoting the effects of spacetime dimension, rotation, and higher curvature\ncorrections on the efficiency of the cycle.\n", "  Despite a long record of intense efforts, the basic mechanisms by which\ndissipation emerges from the microscopic dynamics of a relativistic fluid still\nelude a complete understanding. In particular, no unique pathway from kinetic\ntheory to hydrodynamics has been identified as yet, with different approaches\nleading to different values of the transport coefficients. In this Letter, we\napproach the problem by matching data from lattice kinetic simulations with\nanalytical predictions. Our numerical results provide neat evidence in favour\nof the Chapman-Enskog procedure, as suggested by recently theoretical analyses,\nalong with qualitative hints at the basic reasons why the Chapman-Enskog\nexpansion might be better suited than Grad's method to capture the emergence of\ndissipative effects in relativistic fluids.\n", "  We consider a bipartite quantum conductor and discuss the joint probability\ndistribution of particle number in a subsystem and the self-information\nassociated with the reduced density matrix of the subsystem. By extending the\nmulti-contour Keldysh Green function technique, we calculate the R\\'enyi\nentropy of a positive integer order $M$ subjected to the particle number\nconstraint, from which we derive the joint probability distribution. For\nenergy-independent transmission, we derive the time dependence of the\naccessible entanglement entropy, or the conditional entropy. We analyze the\njoint probability distribution for energy-dependent transmission probability at\nthe steady state under the coherent resonant tunneling and the incoherent\nsequential tunneling conditions. We also discuss the probability distribution\nof the efficiency, which measures the information content transfered by a\nsingle electron.\n", "  We study co-existence system of both bosonic and fermionic degrees of\nfreedom. For such system with up to first derivatives in Lagrangian, we find\nOstrogradsky-type ghost-free condition in Hamiltonian analysis, which is found\nto be the same with requiring that the equations of motion of fermions are\nfirst-order in Lagrangian formulation. When fermionic degrees of freedom are\npresent, uniqueness of time evolution is not guaranteed a priori because of the\nGrassmann property. We confirm that the additional condition, which is\nintroduced to close Hamiltonian analysis, also ensures the uniqueness of the\ntime evolution of system.\n", "  We examine the onset of turbulence in Waleffe flow -- the planar shear flow\nbetween stress-free boundaries driven by a sinusoidal body force. By truncating\nthe wall-normal representation to four modes, we are able to simulate system\nsizes an order of magnitude larger than any previously simulated, and thereby\nto attack the question of universality for a planar shear flow. We demonstrate\nthat the equilibrium turbulence fraction increases continuously from zero above\na critical Reynolds number and that statistics of the turbulent structures\nexhibit the power-law scalings of the (2+1)-D directed percolation universality\nclass.\n", "  We determine the shear viscosity of the ultracold Fermi gas at unitarity in\nthe normal phase using hydrodynamic expansion data. The analysis is based on a\ngeneralized fluid dynamic framework which ensures a smooth transition between\nthe fluid dynamic core of the cloud and the ballistic corona. We use expansion\ndata taken by Joseph et al. and measurements of the equation of state by Ku et\nal. We find that the shear viscosity to particle density ratio just above the\ncritical temperature is $\\eta/n|_{T_c}=0.41\\pm 0.11$. We also obtain evidence\nthat the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio has a minimum slightly above\n$T_c$ with $\\eta/s |_{\\it min}=0.50\\pm 0.10$.\n", "  We present stellar density maps of the Galactic outer disc with red clump\nstars from the LAMOST data. These samples are separated into younger (mean age\n~ 2.7 Gyr) and older (mean age ~ 4.6 Gyr) populations so that they can trace\nthe variation of the structures with ages in the range of the Galactocentric\nradius R from 9 to 13.5 kpc. We show that both the scale heights for the two\npopulations increase with R and display radial gradients of 48 +/- 6 and 40 +/-\n4 pc/kpc for the older and younger populations, respectively. This is evident\nthat the flaring occurs in the thin disc populations with a wide range of ages.\nMoreover, the intensity of flaring seems not significantly related to the age\nof the thin disc populations. On the other hand, the scale lengths of the\nradial surface density profiles are 4.7 +/- 0.5 kpc for the younger and 3.4 +/-\n0.2 kpc for the older population, meaning that the younger disc population is\nmore radially extended than the older one. Although the fraction of the younger\npopulation mildly increases from 28% at R ~ 9 to about 35% at R ~ 13 kpc, the\nolder population is prominent with the fraction no less than 65% in the outer\ndisc.\n", "  A new slow growth formulation for DNS of wall-bounded turbulent flow is\ndeveloped and demonstrated to enable extension of slow growth modeling concepts\nto complex boundary layer flows. As in previous slow growth approaches, the\nformulation assumes scale separation between the fast scales of turbulence and\nthe slow evolution of statistics such as the mean flow. This separation enables\nthe development of approaches where the fast scales of turbulence are directly\nsimulated while the forcing provided by the slow evolution is modeled. The\nresulting model admits periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise\ndirection, which avoids the need for extremely long domains and complex inflow\nconditions that typically accompany spatially developing simulations. Further,\nit enables the use of efficient Fourier numerics. Unlike previous approaches,\nthe present approach is based on a temporally evolving boundary layer and is\nspecifically tailored to give results for calibration and validation of RANS\nturbulence models. The use of a temporal homogenization simplifies the\nmodeling, enabling straightforward extension to flows with complicating\nfeatures, including cold and blowing walls. To generate data useful for\ncalibration and validation of RANS models, special care is taken to ensure that\nthe mean slow growth forcing is closed in terms of the mean and other\nquantities that appear in standard RANS models, ensuring that there is no\nconfounding between typical RANS closures and additional closures required for\nthe slow growth problem. The performance of the method is demonstrated on two\nproblems: an essentially incompressible, zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer\nand a transonic boundary layer over a cooled wall with wall transpiration.\n", "  We theoretically examine a cross effect of magnetic field and charge current\non antiferromagnetic domain wall dynamics. Since antiferromagnetic materials\nare largely insensitive to external magnetic fields in general, charge current\nhas been shown recently as an alternative and efficient way to manipulate\nantiferromagnets. We find a new role of the magnetic field in the\nantiferromagnetic dynamics that appears when it is combined with charge\ncurrent, demonstrating a domain wall motion in the presence of both field and\ncurrent. We show that a spatially-varying magnetic field can shift the\ncurrent-driven domain-wall velocity, depending on the domain-wall structure and\nthe direction of the field-gradient. Our result suggests a novel concept of\nfield-control of current-driven antiferromagnetic dynamics.\n", "  The connection between the Leggett-Garg inequality and optimal scenarios from\nthe point of view of quantum metrology is investigated for perfect and noisy\ngeneral dichotomic measurements. In this context, we show that the Fisher\ninformation can be expressed in terms of quantum temporal correlations. This\nconnection allows us to associate scenarios with relatively high Fisher\ninformation to scenarios in which the Leggett-Garg inequality is violated. We\nthus demonstrate a qualitative and, to some extent, quantitative link between\nmeasurement invasiveness and metrological performance. Finally, we illustrate\nour results by using a specific model for spin systems.\n", "  We present and analyze Raman spectra of the Mott insulator Ca$_2$RuO$_4$,\nwhose quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnetic order has been described as a\ncondensate of low-lying spin-orbit excitons with angular momentum $J_{eff}=1$.\nIn the $A_g$ polarization geometry, the amplitude (Higgs) mode of the\nspin-orbit condensate is directly probed in the scalar channel, thus avoiding\ninfrared-singular magnon contributions. In the $B_{1g}$ geometry, we observe a\nsingle-magnon peak as well as two-magnon and two-Higgs excitations. Model\ncalculations using exact diagonalization quantitatively agree with the\nobservations. Together with recent neutron scattering data, our study provides\nstrong evidence for excitonic magnetism in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ and points out new\nperspectives for research on the Higgs mode in two dimensions.\n", "  We calculate the optical conductivity of an anisotropic two-dimensional\nsystem with Rashba spin-flip excitation within the Kubo formalism. We show that\nthe anisotropic Rashba effect caused by an external field changes significantly\nthe magnitude of the spin splitting. Furthermore, we obtain an analytical\nexpression for the longitudinal optical conductivity associated with inter-band\ntransitions as a function of the frequency for an arbitrary polarization angle.\nWe find that the diagonal components of the optical conductivity tensor are\ndirection-dependent and the spectrum of optical absorption is strongly\nanisotropic with an absorption window. The height and width of this absorption\nwindow are very sensitive to the system anisotropy. While the height of\nabsorption peak increases with increasing effective mass anisotropy ratio, the\npeak intensity is larger when the light polarization is along the armchair\ndirection. Moreover, the absorption peak width becomes broader as the density\nof state mass or Rashba interaction is enhanced. These features can be used to\ndetermine parameters relevant for spintronics through the optical absorption\nspectrum.\n", "  We report structural, susceptibility and specific heat studies of\nstoichiometric and off-stoichiometric poly- and single crystals of the A-site\nspinel compound FeSc2S4. In stoichiometric samples no long-range magnetic order\nis found down to 1.8 K. The magnetic susceptibility of these samples is field\nindependent in the temperature range 10 - 400 K and does not show irreversible\neffects at low temperatures. In contrast, the magnetic susceptibility of\nsamples with iron excess shows substantial field dependence at high\ntemperatures and manifests a pronounced magnetic irreversibility at low\ntemperatures with a difference between ZFC and FC susceptibilities and a\nmaximum at 10 K reminiscent of a magnetic transition. Single crystal x-ray\ndiffraction of the stoichiometric samples revealed a single phase spinel\nstructure without site inversion. In single crystalline samples with Fe excess\nbesides the main spinel phase a second ordered single-crystal phase was\ndetected with the diffraction pattern of a vacancy-ordered superstructure of\niron sulfide, close to the 5C polytype Fe9S10. Specific heat studies reveal a\nbroad anomaly, which evolves below 20 K in both stoichiometric and\noff-stoichiometric crystals. We show that the low-temperature specific heat can\nbe well described by considering the low-lying spin-orbital electronic levels\nof Fe2+ ions. Our results demonstrate significant influence of excess Fe ions\non intrinsic magnetic behavior of FeSc2S4 and provide support for the\nspin-orbital liquid scenario proposed in earlier studies for the stoichiometric\ncompound.\n", "  The response of an electron system to electromagnetic fields with sharp\nspatial variations is strongly dependent on quantum electronic properties, even\nin ambient conditions, but difficult to access experimentally. We use\npropagating graphene plasmons, together with an engineered dielectric-metallic\nenvironment, to probe the graphene electron liquid and unveil its detailed\nelectronic response at short wavelengths.The near-field imaging experiments\nreveal a parameter-free match with the full theoretical quantum description of\nthe massless Dirac electron gas, in which we identify three types of quantum\neffects as keys to understanding the experimental response of graphene to\nshort-ranged terahertz electric fields. The first type is of single-particle\nnature and is related to shape deformations of the Fermi surface during a\nplasmon oscillations. The second and third types are a many-body effect\ncontrolled by the inertia and compressibility of the interacting electron\nliquid in graphene. We demonstrate how, in principle, our experimental approach\ncan determine the full spatiotemporal response of an electron system.\n", "  Context. DG Tau is a low-mass pre-main sequence star, whose strongly\naccreting protoplanetary disk exhibits a so-far enigmatic behavior: its\nmid-infrared thermal emission is strongly time-variable, even turning the 10\n$\\mu$m silicate feature from emission to absorption temporarily. Aims. We look\nfor the reason for the spectral variability at high spatial resolution and at\nmultiple epochs. Methods. We study the temporal variability of the mid-infrared\ninterferometric signal, observed with the VLTI/MIDI instrument at six epochs\nbetween 2011 and 2014. We fit a geometric disk model to the observed\ninterferometric signal to obtain spatial information about the disk. We also\nmodel the mid-infrared spectra by template fitting to characterize the profile\nand time dependence of the silicate emission. We use physically motivated\nradiative transfer modeling to interpret the mid-infrared interferometric\nspectra. Results. The inner disk (r<1-3 au) spectra exhibit a 10 $\\mu$m\nabsorption feature related to amorphous silicate grains. The outer disk (r>1-3\nau) spectra show a crystalline silicate feature in emission, similar to the\nspectra of comet Hale-Bopp. The striking difference between the inner and outer\ndisk spectral feature is highly unusual among T Tauri stars. The mid-infrared\nvariability is dominated by the outer disk. The strength of the silicate\nfeature changed by more than a factor of two. Between 2011 and 2014 the\nhalf-light radius of the mid-infrared-emitting region decreased from 1.15 to\n0.7 au. Conclusions. For the origin of the absorption we discuss four possible\nexplanations: a cold obscuring envelope, an accretion heated inner disk, a\ntemperature inversion on the disk surface and a misaligned inner geometry. The\nsilicate emission in the outer disk can be explained by dusty material high\nabove the disk plane, whose mass can change with time, possibly due to\nturbulence in the disk.\n", "  Magnetic fields in galaxies are believed to be the result of dynamo\namplification of initially weak seed fields, reaching equipartition strength\ninside the interstellar medium. The small-scale dynamo appears to be a viable\nmechanism to explain observations of strong magnetic fields in present-day and\nhigh-redshift galaxies, considering the extreme weakness of seed fields\npredicted by battery mechanisms or primordial fields. Performing\nhigh-resolution adaptive mesh magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a small mass,\nisolated cooling halo with an initial magnetic seed field strength well below\nequipartition, we follow the small-scale dynamo amplification from\nsupernova-induced turbulence up to saturation of the field. We find that\nsaturation occurs when the average magnetic pressure reaches only 3 % to 5 % of\nthe turbulent pressure. The magnetic energy growth transitions from exponential\nto linear, and finally comes to halt. The saturation level increases slightly\nwith grid resolution. These results are in good agreement with theoretical\npredictions for magnetic Prandtl numbers of order $\\mathrm{Pr_M} \\sim 1$ and\nturbulent Mach numbers of order $\\mathrm{M} \\sim 10$. When we suppress\nsupernova feedback after our simulation has reached saturation, we find that\nturbulence decays and that the gas falls back onto a thin disk with the\nmagnetic field in local equipartition.\n  We propose a scenario in which galactic magnetic fields are amplified from\nweak seed fields in the early stages of the Universe to sub-equipartition\nfields, owing to the turbulent environment of feedback-dominated galaxies at\nhigh redshift, and are evolved further in a later stage up to equipartition, as\ngalaxies transformed into more quiescent, large spiral disks.\n", "  The density correlations of some singular Fermi liquids with anomalous\nproperties such as resistivity varying linearly with T at low temperatures, a\n$T \\log T$ contribution to the entropy and thermopower, etc., are expected to\nbe quite different from that in Landau Fermi liquids. A possible statistical\nmechanical model for the quantum critical fluctuations in diverse systems with\nsuch properties is the 2D dissipative quantum XY model. Exact relations between\nthe density correlations and singular irreducible vertices due to coupling of\nFermions to the topological excitations of the 2D dissipative quantum XY model\nare used to derive results which were proposed phenomenologically long ago but\nare measurable only recently due to advances in experimental techniques. The\ndensity correlations are unusual at all momenta ${\\bf q}$ and energy $\\nu$,\nfrom the hydrodynamic limit to that for large momenta and energy. The\nhydrodynamic limit together with the continuity equation gives the linear in T\nresistivity. The density correlations are almost independent of frequency up to\na high frequency cut-off for $q_{ZB} \\gtrsim q >> \\nu/v_F$; $q_{ZB}$ is the\nBrillouin zone boundary and $v_F$ is the Fermi-velocity. The results should be\napplicable to loop-current quantum criticality in cuprates, and to 2D Fe based\ncompounds near their antiferromagnetic quantum-criticality. The relation of the\nresults to the temperature and frequency dependent conductivity and to Raman\nresponse is also discussed.\n", "  We consider pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on four-dimensional de Sitter space\ndS$_4$ and construct a smooth and spatially homogeneous magnetic solution to\nthe Yang-Mills equations. Slicing dS$_4$ as ${\\mathbb R}\\times S^3$, via an\nSU(2)-equivariant ansatz we reduce the Yang-Mills equations to ordinary matrix\ndifferential equations and further to Newtonian dynamics in a double-well\npotential. Its local maximum yields a Yang-Mills solution whose color-magnetic\nfield at time $\\tau\\in{\\mathbb R}$ is given by $\\tilde{B}_a=-\\frac12\nI_a/(R^2\\cosh^2\\!\\tau)$, where $I_a$ for $a=1,2,3$ are the SU(2) generators and\n$R$ is the de Sitter radius. At any moment, this spatially homogeneous\nconfiguration has finite energy, but its action is also finite and of the value\n$-\\frac12j(j{+}1)(2j{+}1)\\pi^3$ in a spin-$j$ representation. Similarly, the\ndouble-well bounce produces a family of homogeneous finite-action\nelectric-magnetic solutions with the same energy. There is a continuum of other\nsolutions whose energy and action extend down to zero.\n", "  At low temperatures in ultraclean GaAs-AlGaAs heterojunctions, high\nfractional Landau levels break rotational symmetry, leading to increasingly\nanisotropic transport properties as temperature is lowered below $\\sim$150mK.\nWhile the onset of transport anisotropy is well described by an XY model of an\nelectron nematic in the presence of a weak uniform symmetry-breaking term, the\nlow temperature behavior deviates significantly from this model. We find that\ninclusion of interactions between the electron nematic and the underlying\ncrystalline lattice in the form of a 4-fold symmetry breaking term is\nsufficient to describe the entire temperature dependence of the transport\nanisotropy. This implies that the quantum Hall electron nematic is in the Ising\nuniversality class. We propose new experimental tests that can distinguish\nwhether any two-dimensional electron nematic is in the XY or Ising universality\nclass.\n", "  We demonstrate an enhanced, bidirectional, in-plane magnetic field tuning of\nthe gyrotropic resonance frequency of a magnetic vortex within a disk by\nintroducing a flat edge. When the core is in its vicinity, the flat edge\nlocally reduces the core's directional dynamic stiffness for movement parallel\nto the edge. This strongly reduces the net dynamic core stiffness, leading to\nthe gyrotropic frequency being significantly less than when the core is\ncentered (or located near the round edge). This leads to the measurable range\nof gyrotropic frequencies being more than doubled and also results in a clear\nchirality-mediated bistability of the gyrotropic resonance frequency due to\nwhat is effectively a chirality-dependence of the core's confining potential.\n", "  We report the joint WASP/KELT discovery of WASP-167b/KELT-13b, a transiting\nhot Jupiter with a 2.02-d orbit around a $V$ = 10.5, F1V star with [Fe/H] = 0.1\n$\\pm$ 0.1. The 1.5 R$_{\\rm Jup}$ planet was confirmed by Doppler tomography of\nthe stellar line profiles during transit. We place a limit of $<$ 8 M$_{\\rm\nJup}$ on its mass. The planet is in a retrograde orbit with a sky-projected\nspin-orbit angle of $\\lambda = -165^{\\circ} \\pm 5^{\\circ}$. This is in\nagreement with the known tendency for orbits around hotter stars to be more\nlikely to be misaligned. WASP-167/KELT-13 is one of the few systems where the\nstellar rotation period is less than the planetary orbital period. We find\nevidence of non-radial stellar pulsations in the host star, making it a\n$\\delta$-Scuti or $\\gamma$-Dor variable. The similarity to WASP-33, a\npreviously known hot-Jupiter host with pulsations, adds to the suggestion that\nclose-in planets might be able to excite stellar pulsations.\n", "  We analyze sunspots rotation and magnetic transients in NOAA AR 11429 during\ntwo X-class (X5.4 and X1.3) flares using the data from the Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager on board the \\emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory}. A large leading\nsunspot with positive magnetic polarity rotated counterclockwise. As expected,\nthe rotation was significantly affected by the two flares. The magnetic\ntransients induced by the flares were clearly evident in the sunspots with\nnegative polarity. They were moving across the sunspots with speed of order\n$3-7\\ \\rm km \\ s^{-1}$. Furthermore, the trend of magnetic flux evolution of\nthese sunspots exhibited changes associated with the flares. These results may\nshed light on the understanding of the evolution of sunspots.\n", "  Recently, in a study the X-ray flaring activity of Sgr A* with Chandra and\nXMM-Newton public observations from 1999 to 2014 and 2014 Swift data, it has\nbeen argued that the \"bright and very bright\" flaring rate raised from 2014\nAug. 31. Thanks to 482ks of observations performed in 2015 with Chandra,\nXMM-Newton and Swift, we test the significance of this rise of flaring rate and\ndetermine the threshold of unabsorbed flare flux or fluence leading to any\nflaring-rate change. The mean unabsorbed fluxes of the 107 flares detected in\nthe 1999-2015 observations are consistently computed from the extracted spectra\nand calibration files, assuming the same spectral parameters. We construct the\nobserved flare fluxes and durations distribution for the XMM-Newton and Chandra\nflares and correct it from the detection biases to estimate the intrinsic\ndistribution from which we determine the average flare detection efficiency for\neach observation. We apply the BB algorithm on the flare arrival times\ncorrected from the corresponding efficiency. We confirm a constant overall\nflaring rate in 1999-2015 and a rise in the flaring rate for the most\nluminous/energetic flares from 2014 Aug. 31 (4 months after the passage of the\nDSO/G2 close to Sgr A*). We also identify a decay of the flaring rate for the\nless luminous and less energetic flares from 2013 Aug. and Nov., respectively\n(10 and 7 months before the pericenter of the DSO/G2). The decay of the faint\nflaring rate is difficult to explain by the tidal disruption of the DSO/G2,\nwhose stellar nature is now well established, since it occurred well before its\npericenter. Moreover, a mass transfer from the DSO/G2 to Sgr A* is not required\nto produce the rise in the bright flaring rate since the energy saved by the\ndecay of the number of faint flares during a long time period may be later\nreleased by several bright flares during a shorter time period. (abridged)\n", "  We calculate the effect of a static electric field on the critical\ntemperature of a s-wave one band superconductor in the framework of proximity\neffect Eliashberg theory. In the weak electrostatic field limit the theory has\nno free parameters while, in general, the only free parameter is the thickness\nof the surface layer where the electric field acts. We conclude that the best\nsituation for increasing the critical temperature is to have a very thin film\nof a superconducting material with a strong increase of electron-phonon (boson)\nconstant upon charging.\n", "  The formation process of massive stars is still poorly understood. Massive\nyoung stellar objects (mYSOs) are deeply embedded in their parental clouds,\nthey are rare and thus typically distant, and their reddened spectra usually\npreclude the determination of their photospheric parameters. M17 is one of the\nbest studied HII regions in the sky, is relatively nearby, and hosts a young\nstellar population. With X-shooter on the ESO Very Large Telescope we have\nobtained optical to near-infrared spectra of candidate mYSOs, identified by\nHanson et al. (1997), and a few OB stars in this region. The large wavelength\ncoverage enables a detailed spectroscopic analysis of their photospheres and\ncircumstellar disks. We confirm the pre-main sequence (PMS) nature of six of\nthe stars and characterise the O stars. The PMS stars have radii consistent\nwith being contracting towards the main sequence and are surrounded by a\nremnant accretion disk. The observed infrared excess and the (double-peaked)\nemission lines provide the opportunity to measure structured velocity profiles\nin the disks. We compare the observed properties of this unique sample of young\nmassive stars with evolutionary tracks of massive protostars by Hosokawa &\nOmukai (2009), and propose that these mYSOs near the western edge of the HII\nregion are on their way to become main-sequence stars ($\\sim 6 - 20$\n$M_{\\odot}$) after having undergone high mass-accretion rates (${\\dot{M}_{\\rm\nacc}} \\sim 10^{-4} - 10^{-3}$ $M_{\\odot}$ $\\rm yr^{-1}$). Their spin\ndistribution upon arrival at the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) is consistent\nwith that observed for young B stars, assuming conservation of angular momentum\nand homologous contraction.\n", "  The discovery of radionuclides like 60Fe with half-lives of million years in\ndeep-sea crusts and sediments offers the unique possibility to date and locate\nnearby supernovae. We want to quantitatively establish that the 60Fe\nenhancement is the result of several supernovae which are also responsible for\nthe formation of the Local Bubble, our Galactic habitat. We performed\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations (with\nresolutions down to subparsec scale) of the Local Bubble and the neighbouring\nLoop I superbubble in different homogeneous, self-gravitating environments. For\nsetting up the Local and Loop I superbubble, we took into account the time\nsequence and locations of the generating core-collapse supernova explosions,\nwhich were derived from the mass spectrum of the perished members of certain\nstellar moving groups. The release of 60Fe and its subsequent turbulent mixing\nprocess inside the superbubble cavities was followed via passive scalars, where\nthe yields of the decaying radioisotope were adjusted according to recent\nstellar evolution calculations. The models are able to reproduce both the\ntiming and the intensity of the 60Fe excess observed with rather high\nprecision, provided that the external density does not exceed 0.3 cm-3 on\naverage. Thus the two best-fit models presented here were obtained with\nbackground media mimicking the classical warm ionised and warm neutral medium.\nWe also found that 60Fe (which is condensed onto dust grains) can be delivered\nto Earth via two physical mechanisms: either through individual fast-paced\nsupernova blast waves, which cross the Earth's orbit sometimes even twice as a\nresult of reflection from the Local Bubble's outer shell, or, alternatively,\nthrough the supershell of the Local Bubble itself, injecting the 60Fe content\nof all previous supernovae at once, but over a longer time range.\n", "  The answer is Yes! We indeed find that interacting dark energy can alleviate\nthe current tension on the value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ between the\nCosmic Microwave Background anisotropies constraints obtained from the Planck\nsatellite and the recent direct measurements reported by Riess et al. 2016. The\ncombination of these two datasets points towards an evidence for a non-zero\ndark matter-dark energy coupling $\\xi$ at more than two standard deviations,\nwith $\\xi=-0.26_{-0.12}^{+0.16}$ at $95\\%$ CL. However the $H_0$ tension is\nbetter solved when the equation of state of the interacting dark energy\ncomponent is allowed to freely vary, with a phantom-like equation of state\n$w=-1.184\\pm0.064$ (at $68 \\%$ CL), ruling out the pure cosmological constant\ncase, $w=-1$, again at more than two standard deviations. When Planck data are\ncombined with external datasets, as BAO, JLA Supernovae Ia luminosity\ndistances, cosmic shear or lensing data, we find good consistency with the\ncosmological constant scenario and no compelling evidence for a dark\nmatter-dark energy coupling.\n", "  We propose to use proton knockout reactions (p,2p) from a deeply bound orbit\nas a new probe into three-nucleon-force (3NF) effects. The remarkable advantage\nof using (p,2p) reaction is that we can choose an appropriate kinematical\ncondition to probe the 3NF effects. We analyze (p,2p) reactions on a 40Ca\ntarget within the framework of distorted-wave impulse approximation with a\ng-matrix interaction based on chiral two- and three-nucleon forces. The chiral\n3NF effects significantly change the peak height of the triple differential\ncross section of (p,2p) reaction. We also clarify the correspondence between\nthe (p,2p) cross sections and the in- medium pp cross sections.\n", "  Calculations of the effects of band structure on the neutron superfluid\ndensity in the crust of neutron stars made under the assumption that the\neffects of pairing are small [N. Chamel, Phys. Rev. C 85, 035801 (2012)] lead\nto moments of inertia of superfluid neutrons so small that the crust alone is\ninsufficient to account for the magnitude of neutron star glitches. Inspired by\nearlier work on ultracold atomic gases in an optical lattice, we investigate\nfermions with attractive interactions in a periodic lattice in the mean-field\napproximation. The effects of band structure are suppressed when the pairing\ngap is of order or greater than the strength of the lattice potential. By\napplying the results to the inner crust of neutron stars, we conclude that the\nreduction of the neutron superfluid density is considerably less than\npreviously estimated and, consequently, it is premature to rule out models of\nglitches based on neutron superfluidity in the crust.\n", "  Characterizing the evolution of the faint end of the cluster red sequence\n(RS) galaxy luminosity function (GLF) with redshift is a milestone in\nunderstanding galaxy evolution. However, the community is still divided in that\nrespect, hesitating between an enrichment of the RS due to efficient quenching\nof blue galaxies from $z\\sim1$ to present-day or a scenario in which the RS is\nbuilt at a higher redshift and does not evolve afterwards. Recently, it has\nbeen proposed that surface brightness (SB) selection effects could possibly\nsolve the literature disagreement, accounting for the diminishing of the RS\nfaint population in ground based observations. We investigate this hypothesis\nby comparing the RS GLFs of 16 CLASH clusters computed independently from\nground-based Subaru/Suprime-Cam and HST/ACS images in the redshift range\n$0.187\\leq z\\leq0.686$. We stack individual cluster GLFs in redshift and mass\nbins.\n  We find similar RS GLFs for space and ground based data, with a difference of\n0.2$\\sigma$ in the faint end parameter $\\alpha$ when stacking all clusters\ntogether and a maximum difference of 0.9$\\sigma$ in the case of the high\nredshift stack, demonstrating a weak dependence on the type of observations in\nthe probed range of redshift and mass. When considering the full sample, we\nestimate $\\alpha = -0.76 \\pm 0.07$ and $\\alpha = -0.78 \\pm 0.06$ with HST and\nSubaru respectively. We note a mild variation of the faint end with redshift at\na 1.7$\\sigma$ and 2.6$\\sigma$ significance. We investigate the effect of SB\ndimming by simulating our low redshift galaxies at high redshift. We measure an\nevolution in the faint end slope of less than 1$\\sigma$ in this case, implying\nthat the observed signature is moderately larger than one would expect from SB\ndimming alone, and indicating a true evolution in the faint end slope.\n(Abridged...)\n", "  We report thermal control of mode hybridization between the ferromagnetic\nresonance (FMR) and a planar resonator (notch filter) working at 4.74 GHz. The\nchosen magnetic material is a ferrimagnetic insulator (Yttrium Iron Garnet:\nYIG) covered by 6 nm of platinum (Pt). A current induced heating method has\nbeen used in order to enhance the temperature of the YIG/Pt system. The device\npermits us to control the transmission spectra and the magnon-photon coupling\nstrength at room temperature. These experimental findings reveal potentially\napplicable tunable microwave filtering function.\n", "  We consider a one-dimensional classical Coulomb gas of $N$ like-charges in a\nharmonic potential -- also known as the one-dimensional one-component plasma\n(1dOCP). We compute analytically the probability distribution of the position\n$x_{\\max}$ of the rightmost charge in the limit of large $N$. We show that the\ntypical fluctuations of $x_{\\max}$ around its mean are described by a\nnon-trivial scaling function, with asymmetric tails. This distribution is\ndifferent from the Tracy-Widom distribution of $x_{\\max}$ for the Dyson's\nlog-gas. We also compute the large deviation functions of $x_{\\max}$ explicitly\nand show that the system exhibits a third-order phase transition, as in the\nlog-gas. Our theoretical predictions are verified numerically.\n", "  Recent studies have suggested that star formation (SF) in dense gas may be\ngoverned by essentially the same law in Galactic clouds and external galaxies.\nThis conclusion remains controversial, however, because different tracers have\nbeen used to probe the dense gas mass in Galactic and extragalactic studies. We\nconducted observations of Aquila, Oph., and Orion B in HCN(1-0), HCO$^+$(1-0),\nand their isotopomers to calibrate the HCN and HCO$^+$ lines used as dense gas\ntracers in extragalactic studies and to test the possible universality of the\nstar formation efficiency in dense gas, SFE$_{dense}$. H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and\nH$^{13}$CN were observed to be good tracers of the filaments detected with\nHerschel. Comparing the luminosities $L_{HCN}$ and $L_{HCO^+}$ with the\nreference masses $M_{Herschel}^{Av>8}$, the empirical conversion factors\n$\\alpha_{Herschel-HCN}$ and $\\alpha_{Herschel-HCO^+}$ were found to be\nanti-correlated with the local FUV strength. In agreement with Pety et al.\n(2017), HCN and HCO$^+$ were also found to trace gas down to Av>2. As a result,\npublished extragalactic HCN studies must be tracing all of the moderate density\ngas. Estimating the contribution of this moderate density gas from the typical\ncolumn density PDFs in nearby clouds, we obtained the following $G_0$-dependent\nHCN conversion factor for external\ngalaxies:$\\alpha_{Herschel-HCN}^{fit'}=64\\times G_0^{-0.34}$. Re-estimating the\ndense gas masses in external galaxies with $\\alpha_{Herschel-HCN}^{fit'}$, we\nfound that SFE$_{dense}$ is remarkably constant over 8 orders of magnitude in\ndense gas mass. Our results confirm that SFE$_{dense}$ of galaxies is\nquasi-universal on a wide range of scales from ~1-10pc to >10kpc. Based on the\ntight link between SF and filamentary structure found in Herschel studies of\nnearby clouds, we argue that SFE$_{dense}$ is primarily set by the microphysics\nof SF in filaments.\n", "  We derive general expressions for resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS)\noperators for $t_{2g}$ orbital systems, which exhibit a rich array of\nunconventional magnetism arising from unquenched orbital moments. Within the\nfast collision approximation, which is valid especially for 4$d$ and 5$d$\ntransition metal compounds with short core-hole lifetimes, the RIXS operators\nare expressed in terms of total spin and orbital angular momenta of the\nconstituent ions. We then map these operators onto pseudospins that represent\nspin-orbit entangled magnetic moments in systems with strong spin-orbit\ncoupling. Applications of our theory to such systems as iridates and ruthenates\nare discussed, with a particular focus on compounds based on $d^4$ ions with\nVan Vleck-type nonmagnetic ground state.\n", "  We study the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice with the\nnearest-neighbor $J_1 > 0$, the next-nearest-neighobr $J_2 > 0$ Heisenberg\ninteractions, and the additional scalar chiral interaction $J_{\\chi}(\\vec{S}_i\n\\times \\vec{S}_j) \\cdot \\vec{S}_k$ for the three spins in all the triangles\nusing large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculation on cylinder\ngeometry. With increasing $J_2$ ($J_2/J_1 \\leq 0.3$) and $J_{\\chi}$\n($J_{\\chi}/J_1 \\leq 1.0$) interactions, we establish a quantum phase diagram\nwith the magnetically ordered $120^{\\circ}$ phase, stripe phase, and\nnon-coplanar tetrahedral phase. In between these magnetic order phases, we find\na chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase, which is identified as a $\\nu = 1/2$ bosonic\nfractional quantum Hall state with possible spontaneous rotational symmetry\nbreaking. By switching on the chiral interaction, we find that the previously\nidentified spin liquid in the $J_1 - J_2$ triangular model ($0.08 \\lesssim\nJ_2/J_1 \\lesssim 0.15$) shows a phase transition to the CSL phase at very small\n$J_{\\chi}$. We also compute spin triplet gap in both spin liquid phases, and\nour finite-size results suggest large gap in the odd topological sector but\nsmall or vanishing gap in the even sector. We discuss the implications of our\nresults to the nature of the spin liquid phases.\n", "  In this letter we present a measurement of the phase-space density\ndistribution (PSDD) of ultra-cold \\Rb atoms performing 1D anomalous diffusion.\nThe PSDD is imaged using a direct tomographic method based on Raman velocity\nselection. It reveals that the position-velocity correlation function\n$C_{xv}(t)$ builds up on a timescale related to the initial conditions of the\nensemble and then decays asymptotically as a power-law. We show that the decay\nfollows a simple scaling theory involving the power-law asymptotic dynamics of\nposition and velocity. The generality of this scaling theory is confirmed using\nMonte-Carlo simulations of two distinct models of anomalous diffusion.\n", "  We present the Pristine survey, a new narrow-band photometric survey focused\non the metallicity-sensitive Ca H & K lines and conducted in the northern\nhemisphere with the wide-field imager MegaCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii\nTelescope (CFHT). This paper reviews our overall survey strategy and discusses\nthe data processing and metallicity calibration. Additionally we review the\napplication of these data to the main aims of the survey, which are to gather a\nlarge sample of the most metal-poor stars in the Galaxy, to further\ncharacterise the faintest Milky Way satellites, and to map the (metal-poor)\nsubstructure in the Galactic halo. The current Pristine footprint comprises\nover 1,000 deg2 in the Galactic halo ranging from b~30 to 78 and covers many\nknown stellar substructures. We demonstrate that, for SDSS stellar objects, we\ncan calibrate the photometry at the 0.02-magnitude level. The comparison with\nexisting spectroscopic metallicities from SDSS/SEGUE and LAMOST shows that,\nwhen combined with SDSS broad-band g and i photometry, we can use the CaHK\nphotometry to infer photometric metallicities with an accuracy of ~0.2 dex from\n[Fe/H]=-0.5 down to the extremely metal-poor regime ([Fe/H]<-3.0). After the\nremoval of various contaminants, we can efficiently select metal-poor stars and\nbuild a very complete sample with high purity. The success rate of uncovering\n[Fe/H]SEGUE<-3.0 stars among [Fe/H]Pristine<-3.0 selected stars is 24% and 85%\nof the remaining candidates are still very metal poor ([Fe/H]<-2.0). We further\ndemonstrate that Pristine is well suited to identify the very rare and pristine\nGalactic stars with [Fe/H]<-4.0, which can teach us valuable lessons about the\nearly Universe.\n", "  Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) reveals unusual sharp features in\notherwise defect free bismuth nanolines self-assembled on Si(001). They appear\nas subatomic thin lines perpendicular to the bismuth nanoline at positive\nbiases and as atomic size beads at negative biases. Density functional theory\n(DFT) simulations show that these features can be attributed to buckled Si\ndimers substituting for Bi dimers in the nanoline, where the sharp feature is\nthe counterintuitive signature of these dimers flipping during scanning. The\nperfect correspondence between the STM data and the DFT simulation demonstrated\nin this study highlights the detailed understanding we have of the complex\nBi-Si(001) Haiku system.\n", "  We define a procedure to extract the oscillating part of a given nonlinear\nPower Spectrum, and derive an equation describing its evolution including the\nleading effects at all scales. The intermediate scales are taken into account\nby standard perturbation theory, the long range (IR) displacements are included\nby using consistency relations, and the effect of small (UV) scales is included\nvia effective coefficients computed in simulations. We show that the UV effects\nare irrelevant in the evolution of the oscillating part, while they play a\ncrucial role in reproducing the smooth component. Our \"extractor\" operator can\nbe applied to simulations and real data in order to extract the Baryonic\nAcoustic Oscillations (BAO) without any fitting function and nuisance\nparameter. We conclude that the nonlinear evolution of BAO can be accurately\nreproduced at all scales down to $z=0$ by our fast analytical method, without\nany need of extra parameters fitted from simulations.\n", "  We report an analytical theory of linear emission of exchange spin waves from\na Bloch domain wall, excited by a uniform microwave magnetic field. The problem\nis reduced to a one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger-like equation with a\nP\\\"oschl-Teller potential and a driving term of the same profile. The emission\nof plane spin waves is observed at excitation frequencies above a threshold\nvalue, as a result of a linear process. The height-to-width aspect ratio of the\nP\\\"oschl-Teller profile for a domain wall is found to correspond to a local\nmaximum of the emission efficiency. Furthermore, for a tailored P\\\"oschl-Teller\npotential with a variable aspect ratio, particular values of the latter can\nlead to enhanced or even completely suppressed emission.\n", "  Any measurement made using an N-body simulation is subject to noise due to\nthe finite number of particles used to sample the dark matter distribution\nfunction, and the lack of structure below the simulation resolution. This noise\ncan be particularly significant when attempting to measure intrinsically small\nquantities, such as halo spin. In this work we develop a model to describe the\neffects of particle noise on halo spin parameters. This model is calibrated\nusing N-body simulations in which the particle noise can be treated as a\nPoisson process on the underlying dark matter distribution function, and we\ndemonstrate that this calibrated model reproduces measurements of halo spin\nparameter error distributions previously measured in N-body convergence\nstudies. Utilizing this model, along with previous measurements of the\ndistribution of halo spin parameters in N-body simulations, we place\nconstraints on the noise-free distribution of halo spins. We find that the\nnoise-free median spin is 3% lower than that measured directly from the N-body\nsimulation, corresponding to a shift of approximately 40 times the statistical\nuncertainty in this measurement arising purely from halo counting statistics.\nWe also show that measurement of the spin of an individual halo to 10%\nprecision requires at least $4\\times 10^4$ particles in the halo - for halos\ncontaining 200 particles the fractional error on spins measured for individual\nhalos is of order unity.\n", "  We present a study of the hydrodynamics of an active particle, a model\nsquirmer, in an envi- ronment with a broken rotational symmetry: a nematic\nliquid crystal. By combining simulations with analytic calculations, we show\nthat the hydrodynamic coupling between the squirmer flow field and liquid\ncrystalline director can lead to re-orientation of the swimmers. The preferred\norientation depends on the exact details of the squirmer flow field. In a\nsteady state, pushers are shown to swim parallel with the nematic director\nwhile pullers swim perpendicular to the nematic director. This behaviour arises\nsolely from hydrodynamic coupling between the squirmer flow field and\nanisotropic viscosities of the host fluid. Our results suggest that an\nanisotropic swimming medium can be used to characterise and guide spherical\nmicroswimmers in the bulk.\n", "  Recent study has shown that a non-singular oscillating potential, a feature\nof Infinite Derivative Gravity (IDG) theories, matches current experimental\ndata better than the standard GR potential. In this work we show that this\nnon-singular oscillating potential can be given by a wider class of theories\nwhich allows the defocusing of null rays, and therefore geodesic completeness.\nWe consolidate the conditions whereby null geodesic congruences may be made\npast-complete, via the Raychaudhuri Equation, with the requirement of a\nnon-singular Newtonian potential in an IDG theory. In so doing, we examine a\nclass of Newtonian potentials characterised by an additional degree of freedom\nin the scalar propagator, which returns the familiar potential of General\nRelativity at large distances.\n", "  Many spherical viruses encapsulate their genome in protein shells with\nicosahedral symmetry. This process is spontaneous and driven by electrostatic\ninteractions between positive domains on the virus coat proteins and the\nnegative genome. We model the effect of the icosahedral charge distribution\nfrom the protein shell instead of uniform using a mean-field theory. We find\nthat the non-uniform charge distribution strongly affects the optimal genome\nlength, and that it can explain the experimentally observed phenomenon of\novercharging of virus and virus-like particles.\n", "  We examine potential deformations of inner black hole and cosmological\nhorizons in Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om de-Sitter spacetimes. While the rigidity of\nthe outer black hole horizon is guaranteed by theorem, that theorem applies to\nneither the inner black hole nor past cosmological horizon. Further for pure\ndeSitter spacetime it is clear that the cosmological horizon can be deformed\n(by translation). For specific parameter choices, it is shown that both inner\nblack hole and cosmological horizons can be infinitesimally deformed. However\nthese do not extend to finite deformations. The corresponding results for\ngeneral spherically symmetric spacetimes are considered.\n", "  The missing hole packets near the Brillouin zone center render unique\nelectronic structures to the heavily electron doped FeSe-based superconductors\nwith Tc above 40 K. It challenges the existing scenario accounting for the\nnature of superconductivity in the iron-based family. Yet, one hurdle that has\nto be overcome is the materials complexity in the rather limited number of\ncompounds. Here we report the growth of heavily electron doped Li-NH3\nintercalated FeSe single crystals that are free of such complexities and allow\naccess to the intrinsic superconducting properties. Our results show extremely\nlarge electronic anisotropy in both normal and superconducting states.\nMoreover, the anomalous transport properties appear in normal state, which are\nbelieved related to the anisotropy of relaxation time and/or temperature\ndependent electron carrier concentration. In view of the great chemical\nflexibility of intercalants, our findings provide novel platform to\nunderstanding of superconductivity origin of FeSe-related superconductors.\n", "  According to the competitive exclusion principle, in a finite ecosystem,\nextinction occurs naturally when two or more species compete for the same\nresources. An important question that arises is: when coexistence is not\npossible, which mechanisms confer an advantage to a given species against the\nother(s)? In general, it is expected that the species with the higher\nreproductive/death ratio will win the competition, but other mechanisms, such\nas asymmetry in interspecific competition or unequal diffusion rates, have been\nfound to change this scenario dramatically. In this work, we examine\ncompetitive advantage in the context of quasi-neutral population models,\nincluding stochastic models with spatial structure as well as macroscopic\n(mean-field) descriptions. We employ a two-species contact process in which the\n\"biological clock\" of one species is a factor of $\\alpha$ slower than that of\nthe other species. Our results provide new insights into how stochasticity and\ncompetition interact to determine extinction in finite spatial systems. We find\nthat a species with a slower biological clock has an advantage if resources are\nlimited, winning the competition against a species with a faster clock, in\nrelatively small systems. Periodic or stochastic environmental variations also\nfavor the slower species, even in much larger systems.\n", "  Graded metasurfaces exploit the local momentum imparted by an impedance\ngradient to transform the impinging wavefront. This approach suffers from\nfundamental limits on the overall conversion efficiency and it is challenged by\nfabrication limitations on the maximum spatial resolution. Here, we introduce\nthe concept of meta-gratings, which enables arbitrary wavefront engineering\nwith unitary efficiency and significantly lower demands on the fabrication\nprecision. We employ this concept to design reflective metasurfaces for\nwavefront steering without limitations on efficiency. A similar approach is\nenvisioned for transmitted beams and for arbitrary wavefront transformation,\nopening promising opportunities for highly-efficient metasurfaces for extreme\nwave manipulation.\n", "  We theoretically study the impact of impurities on the photogalvanic effect\n(PGE) in Weyl semimetals with weakly tilted Weyl cones. Our calculations are\nbased on a two-nodes model with an inversion symmetry breaking offset and we\nemploy a kinetic equation approach in which both optical transitions as well as\nparticle-hole excitations near the Fermi energy can be taken into account. We\nfocus on the parameter regime with a single photoactive node and control the\ncalculation in small impurity concentration. Internode scattering is treated\ngenerically and therefore our results allow to continuously interpolate between\nthe cases of short range and long range impurities. We find that the time\nevolution of the circular PGE may be nonmonotonic for intermediate internode\nscattering. Furthermore, we show that the tilt vector introduces three\nadditional linearly independent components to the steady state photocurrent.\nAmongst them, the photocurrent in direction of the tilt takes a particular role\ninasmuch it requires elastic internode scattering or inelastic intranode\nscattering to be relaxed. It may therefore be dominant. The tilt also generates\nskew scattering which leads to a current component perpendicular to both the\nincident light and the tilt. We extensively discuss our findings and comment on\nthe possible experimental implications.\n", "  Numerous EWs were discovered by several deep photometric survey and there are\nabout 40785 EW-type binary systems listed in the international variable star\nindex (VSX) by March 13, 2017. 7938 of them were observed by LAMOST by November\n30, 2016 and their spectral types were given. Stellar atmospheric parameters of\n5363 EW-type binary stars were determined based on good spectroscopic\nobservations. In the paper, those EWs were catalogued and their properties are\nanalyzed. The distributions of the orbital period (P), the effect temperature\n(T), the gravitational acceleration (Log(g)), the metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the\nradial velocity (RV) are presented for those observed EW-type systems. It is\nshown that about 80.6\\% sample stars have metallicity below zero indicating\nthat EW-type systems are old stellar population. This is in agreement with the\nthe conclusion that the EW binaries are formed from moderately close binaries\nthrough angular momentum loss via magnetic braking that takes a few hundred\nmillion to a few billion years. The unusual high metallicities of a few percent\nof EWs may be caused by contaminating of material from the evolution of unseen\nneutron stars and black holes in the systems. The correlations between the\norbital period and the effect temperature, the gravitational acceleration and\nthe metallicity are presented and their scatters are mainly caused by (i) the\npresence of the third bodies and (ii) the wrong determined periods sometimes.\nIt is shown that some EW contain evolved component stars and the physical\nproperties of EWs are mainly depending on their orbital periods. It is found\nthat the extremely short-period EWs may be older than their long-period cousins\nbecause they have lower metallicities. This reveals that they have a longer\ntimescale of pre-contact evolution and their formation and evolution are mainly\ndriven by angular momentum loss via magnetic braking.\n", "  A detailed characterization of the particle induced background is fundamental\nfor many of the scientific objectives of the Athena X-ray telescope, thus an\nadequate knowledge of the background that will be encountered by Athena is\ndesirable. Current X-ray telescopes have shown that the intensity of the\nparticle induced background can be highly variable. Different regions of the\nmagnetosphere can have very different environmental conditions, which can, in\nprinciple, differently affect the particle induced background detected by the\ninstruments. We present results concerning the influence of the magnetospheric\nenvironment on the background detected by EPIC instrument onboard XMM-Newton\nthrough the estimate of the variation of the in-Field-of-View background excess\nalong the XMM-Newton orbit. An important contribution to the XMM background,\nwhich may affect the Athena background as well, comes from soft proton flares.\nAlong with the flaring component a low-intensity component is also present. We\nfind that both show modest variations in the different magnetozones and that\nthe soft proton component shows a strong trend with the distance from Earth.\n", "  A search for the dimuon decay of the Higgs boson was performed using data\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the\nATLAS detector in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV at the Large Hadron\nCollider. No significant excess is observed above the expected background. The\nobserved (expected) upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio is\n3.0 (3.1) times the Standard Model prediction at the 95% confidence level for a\nHiggs boson mass of 125 GeV. When combined with the $pp$ collision data at\n$\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV, the observed (expected) upper limit is\n2.8 (2.9) times the Standard Model prediction.\n", "  Phonon-mediated thermal conductivity, which is of great technological\nrelevance, fundamentally arises due to anharmonic scattering from interatomic\npotentials. Despite its prevalence, accurate first-principles calculations of\nthermal conductivity remain challenging, primarily due to the high\ncomputational cost of anharmonic interatomic force constant (IFCs)\ncalculations. Meanwhile, the related anharmonic phenomenon of thermal expansion\nis much more tractable, being computable from the Gr\\\"uneisen parameters\nassociated with phonon frequency shifts due to crystal deformations. In this\nwork, we propose a novel approach for computing the largest cubic IFCs from the\nGr\\\"uneisen parameter data. This allows an approximate determination of the\nthermal conductivity via a much less expensive route. The key insight is that\nalthough the Gr\\\"uneisen parameters cannot possibly contain all the information\non the cubic IFCs, being derivable from spatially uniform deformations, they\ncan still unambiguously and accurately determine the largest and most\nphysically relevant ones. By fitting the anisotropic Gr\\\"uneisen parameter data\nalong judiciously designed deformations, we can deduce (i.e., reverse engineer)\nthe dominant cubic IFCs and estimate three-phonon scattering amplitudes. We\nillustrate our approach by explicitly computing the largest cubic IFCs and\nthermal conductivity of graphene, especially for its out-of-plane (flexural)\nmodes that exhibit anomalously large anharmonic shifts and thermal conductivity\ncontributions. Our calculations on graphene not only exhibits reasonable\nagreement with established DFT results, but also presents a pedagogical\nopportunity for introducing an elegant analytic treatment of the Gr\\\"uneisen\nparameters of generic two-band models. Our approach can be readily extended to\nmore complicated crystalline materials with nontrivial anharmonic lattice\neffects.\n", "  Topologically non-trivial Hamiltonians with periodic boundary conditions are\ncharacterized by strictly quantized invariants. Open questions and fundamental\nchallenges concern their existence, and the possibility of measuring them in\nsystems with open boundary conditions and limited spatial extension. Here, we\nconsider transport in Hofstadter strips, that is, two-dimensional lattices\npierced by a uniform magnetic flux which extend over few sites in one of the\nspatial dimensions. As we show, an atomic wavepacket exhibits a transverse\ndisplacement under the action of a weak constant force. After one Bloch\noscillation, this displacement approaches the quantized Chern number of the\nperiodic system in the limit of vanishing tunneling along the transverse\ndirection. We further demonstrate that this scheme is able to map out the Chern\nnumber of ground and excited bands, and we investigate the robustness of the\nmethod in presence of both disorder and harmonic trapping. Our results prove\nthat topological invariants can be measured in Hofstadter strips with open\nboundary conditions and as few as three sites along one direction.\n", "  It is known since 1980's that the instanton-induced 't Hooft effective\nLagrangian not only can solve the so called $U(1)a$ problem, by making the\n$\\eta'$ meson heavy etc, but it can also lead to chiral symmetry breaking. In\n1990's it was demonstrated that, taken to higher orders, this Lagrangian\ncorrectly reproduces effective forces in a large set of hadronic channels,\nmesonic and baryonic ones. Recent progress in understanding gauge topology at\nfinite temperatures is related with the so called {\\em instanton-dyons}, the\nconstituents of the instantons. Some of them, called $L$-dyons, possess the\nanti-periodic fermionic zero modes, and thus form a new version of the 't Hooft\neffective Lagrangian. This paper is our first study of a wide set of hadronic\ncorrelation function. We found that, at the lowest temperatures at which this\napproach is expected to be applicable, those may be well compatible with what\nis known about them based on phenomenological and lattice studies, provided $L$\nand $M$ type dyons are strongly correlated.\n", "  It is shown that the standard no-boundary wave function has a natural\nexpression in terms of a Lorentzian path integral with its contour defined by\nPicard-Lefschetz theory. The wave function is real, satisfies the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation and predicts an ensemble of asymptotically classical,\ninflationary universes with nearly-Gaussian fluctuations and with a smooth\nsemiclassical origin.\n", "  We demonstrate that the differential conductance, $dI/dV$, measured via\nspectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy in the doped iron\nchalcogenide FeSe$_{0.45}$Te$_{0.55}$, possesses a series of characteristic\nfeatures that allow one to extract the orbital structure of the superconducting\ngaps. This yields nearly isotropic superconducting gaps on the two hole-like\nFermi surfaces, and a strongly anisotropic gap on the electron-like Fermi\nsurface. Moreover, we show that the pinning of nematic fluctuations by defects\ncan give rise to a dumbbell-like spatial structure of the induced impurity\nbound states, and explains the related $C_2$-symmetry in the Fourier\ntransformed differential conductance.\n", "  The cooling of type-I X-ray bursts can be used to probe the nuclear burning\nconditions in neutron star envelopes. The flux decay of the bursts has been\ntraditionally modelled with an exponential, even if theoretical considerations\npredict power-law-like decays. We have analysed a total of 540 type-I X-ray\nbursts from five low-mass X-ray binaries observed with the Rossi X-ray Timing\nExplorer. We grouped the bursts according to the source spectral state during\nwhich they were observed (hard or soft), flagging those bursts that showed\nsigns of photospheric radius expansion (PRE). The decay phase of all the bursts\nwere then fitted with a dynamic power-law index method. This method provides a\nnew way of probing the chemical composition of the accreted material. Our\nresults show that in the hydrogen-rich sources the power-law decay index is\nvariable during the burst tails and that simple cooling models qualitatively\ndescribe the cooling of presumably helium-rich sources 4U 1728-34 and 3A\n1820-303. The cooling in the hydrogen-rich sources 4U 1608-52, 4U 1636-536, and\nGS 1826-24, instead, is clearly different and depends on the spectral states\nand whether PRE occurred or not. Especially the hard state bursts behave\ndifferently than the models predict, exhibiting a peculiar rise in the cooling\nindex at low burst fluxes, which suggests that the cooling in the tail is much\nfaster than expected. Our results indicate that the drivers of the bursting\nbehaviour are not only the accretion rate and chemical composition of the\naccreted material, but also the cooling that is somehow linked to the spectral\nstates. The latter suggests that the properties of the burning layers deep in\nthe neutron star envelope might be impacted differently depending on the\nspectral state.\n", "  Using data from the extended Kepler mission in K2 Campaign 10 we identify two\neclipsing binaries containing white dwarfs with cool companions that have\nextremely short orbital periods of only 71.2 min (SDSS J1205-0242, a.k.a. EPIC\n201283111) and 72.5 min (SDSS J1231+0041, a.k.a. EPIC 248368963). Despite their\nshort periods, both systems are detached with small, low-mass companions, in\none case a brown dwarf, and the other case either a brown dwarf or a low-mass\nstar. We present follow-up photometry and spectroscopy of both binaries, as\nwell as phase-resolved spectroscopy of the brighter system, and use these data\nto place preliminary estimates on the physical and binary parameters. SDSS\nJ1205-0242 is composed of a $0.39\\pm0.02$M$_\\odot$ helium-core white dwarf\nwhich is totally eclipsed by a $0.049\\pm0.006$M$_\\odot$ ($51\\pm6$M$_J$) brown\ndwarf companion, while SDSS J1231+0041 is composed of a $0.56\\pm0.07$M$_\\odot$\nwhite dwarf which is partially eclipsed by a companion of mass $\\lesssim\n0.095$M$_\\odot$. In the case of SDSS J1205-0242 we look at the combined\nconstraints from common-envelope evolution and brown dwarf models; the system\nis compatible with similar constraints from other post common-envelope binaries\ngiven the current parameter uncertainties, but has potential for future\nrefinement.\n", "  Among the 28,000 targeted stars in K2 Field 10 is the white dwarf WD 1202-024\n(EPIC 201283111), first noted in the SDSS survey (SDSS 120515.80-024222.7). We\nhave found that this hot white dwarf (Teff = 22,640 K) is in a very close orbit\n(P = 71 min) with a star of near brown-dwarf mass ~ 0.061 Msun. This period is\nvery close to, or somewhat below, the minimum orbital period of cataclysmic\nvariables with H-rich donor stars. However, we find no evidence that this\nbinary is currently, or ever was, transferring mass from the low-mass companion\nto the white dwarf. We therefore tentatively conclude that this system is still\nin the pre-cataclysmic variable phase, having emerged from a common envelope\nsome 50 +/- 20 Myr ago. Because of the 29-minute integration time of K2, we use\nfollow-up ground-based photometry to better evaluate the eclipsing light curve.\nWe also utilize the original SDSS spectra, in approximately 15-min segments, to\nestimate the radial velocity of the white dwarf in its orbit. An analysis of\nthe light curve, with supplementary constraints, leads to the following system\nparameters: Mwd = 0.415 +/- 0.028 Msun, Rwd = 0.021 +/- 0.001 Rsun, Mcom =\n0.061 +\\- 0.010 Msun, and Rcom = 0.088 +\\- 0.005 Rsun where the subscripts 'wd'\nand 'com' refer to the white dwarf and low-mass companion respectively. If our\ninterpretation of this system as a pre-CV is correct, it has the shortest\nperiod of any such system yet found and should become a compact CV in less than\n250 Myr.\n", "  In this paper, we elaborate on aspects of the recently introduced BMS\nbootstrap programme. We consider two-dimensional (2d) field theories with BMS3\nsymmetry and extensively use highest weight representations to uncover the BMS\nversion of crossing symmetry in 4-point functions that are constrained by\nsymmetry. The BMS bootstrap equation is formulated and then analytic\nexpressions for BMS blocks are constructed by looking at the limit of large\ncentral charges. These results are also applicable to 2d Galilean Conformal\nField Theories through the isomorphism between the BMS3 and 2d Galilean\nConformal Algebras. We recover our previously obtained results in the\nnon-relativistic limit of the corresponding ones in 2d relativistic CFTs. This\nprovides a comprehensive check of our previous analysis. We also explore the\nchiral limit of BMS3 where the BMS algebra reduces to a single copy of the\nVirasoro algebra and show that our analysis is consistent with earlier work in\nthis direction.\n", "  The model of inhomogeneous accretion flow, in which cold clumps are\nsurrounded by hot gas or corona, has been proposed to explain the spectral\nfeatures of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs). In this work, we try to find\npossible observational features in the continuum that can indicate the\nexistence of clumps. The spectra of inhomogeneous accretion flow are calculated\nvia the Monte Carlo method. Since the corresponding accretion flow is unsteady\nand complex, the accretion flow is described by a set of free parameters, the\nranges of which can include the real cases. The influences of the parameters\nare investigated. It is found that the thermal component of the spectra\ndeviates from the multi-color black body spectra in the middle power-law part.\nOn the one hand, a warp appears due to the gap region between the clumps and\nthe outer cold disk, and on the other hand, the slope of the line connecting\nthe thermal peaks deviates from 4/3. The warp feature, as well as the\ncorrelation between the thermal peak at higher frequency and the spectral\nindex, are possible to indicate the existence of clumps, and are worthy of\nfurther investigation with more self-consistent models.\n", "  Broadcasting quantum and classical information is a basic task in quantum\ninformation processing, and is also a useful model in the study of quantum\ncorrelations including quantum discord. We establish a full operational\ncharacterization of two-sided quantum discord in terms of bilocal broadcasting\nof quantum correlations. Moreover, we show that both the optimal fidelity of\nunilocal broadcasting of the correlations in an arbitrary bipartite quantum\nstate and that of broadcasting an arbitrary set of quantum states can be\nformulized as semidefinite programs (SDPs), which are efficiently computable.\nWe also analyze some properties of these SDPs and evaluate the broadcasting\nfidelities for some cases of interest.\n", "  This is the second paper on semiclassical approach based on the density\nmatrix given by the Euclidean time path integral with fixed coinciding\nendpoints. The classical path, interpolating between this point and the\nclassical vacuum, called \"flucton\", plus systematic one- and two-loop\ncorrections, has been calculated in the first paper \\cite{Escobar-Ruiz:2016aqv}\nfor double-well potential and now extended for a number of quantum-mechanical\nproblems (anharmonic oscillator, sine-Gordon potential). The method is based on\nsystematic expansion in Feynman diagrams and thus can be extended to QFTs. We\nshow that the loop expansion in QM reminds the leading log-approximations in\nQFT. In this sequel we present complete set of results obtained using this\nmethod in unified way. Alternatively, starting from the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation we derive a {\\it generalized} Bloch equation which semiclassical-like,\niterative solution generates the loop expansion. We re-derive two loop\nexpansions for all three above potentials and now extend it to three loops,\nwhich has not yet been done via Feynman diagrams. All results for both methods\nare fully consistent with each other. Asymmetric (tilted) double-well potential\n(non-degenerate minima) is also studied using the second method.\n", "  We study spatial spin and density self-ordering of a two-component\nBose-Einstein condensate via collective Raman scattering into a linear cavity\nmode. The onset of the Dicke superradiance phase transition is marked by a\nsimultaneous appearance of a crystalline density order and a spin-wave order.\nThe latter spontaneously breaks the discrete $\\mathbf{Z}_2$ symmetry between\neven and odd sites of the cavity optical potential. Moreover, in the\nsuperradiant state the continuous $U(1)$ symmetry of the relative phase of the\ntwo condensate wavefunctions is explicitly broken by the cavity-induced\nposition-dependent Raman coupling with a zero spatial average. Thus, the\nspatially-averaged relative condensate phase is locked at either $\\pi/2$ or\n$-\\pi/2$. This continuous symmetry breaking and relative condensate phase\nlocking by a zero-average Raman field can be considered as a generic\norder-by-disorder process similar to the random-field-induced order in the\ntwo-dimensional classical ferromagnetic $XY$ spin model. However, the seed of\nthe random field in our model stems from quantum fluctuations in the cavity\nfield and is a dynamical entity affected by self-ordering. The spectra of\nelementary excitations exhibit the typical mode softening at the superradiance\nthreshold.\n", "  In this work, by using strong gravitational lensing (SGL) observations along\nwith Type Ia Supernovae (Union2.1) and gamma ray burst data (GRBs), we propose\na new method to study a possible redshift evolution of $\\gamma(z)$, the mass\ndensity power-law index of strong gravitational lensing systems. In this\nanalysis, we assume the validity of cosmic distance duality relation and the\nflat universe. In order to explore the $\\gamma(z)$ behavior, three different\nparametrizations are considered, namely: (P1) $\\gamma(z_l)=\\gamma_0+\\gamma_1\nz_l$, (P2) $\\gamma(z_l)=\\gamma_0+\\gamma_1 z_l/(1+z_l)$ and (P3)\n$\\gamma(z_l)=\\gamma_0+\\gamma_1 \\ln(1+z_l)$, where $z_l$ corresponds to lens\nredshift. If $\\gamma_0=2$ and $\\gamma_1=0$ the singular isothermal sphere model\nis recovered. Our method is performed on SGL sub-samples defined by different\nlens redshifts and velocity dispersions. For the former case, the results are\nin full agreement with each other, while a 1$\\sigma$ tension between the\nsub-samples with low ($\\leq 250$ km/s) and high ($>250$ km/s) velocity\ndispersions was obtained on the ($\\gamma_0$-$\\gamma_1$) plane. By considering\nthe complete SGL sample, we obtain $\\gamma_0 \\approx 2$ and $ \\gamma_1 \\approx\n0$ within 1$\\sigma$ c.l. for all $\\gamma(z)$ parametrizations. However, we find\nthe following best fit values of $\\gamma_1$: $-0.085$, $-0.16$ and $-0.12$ for\nP1, P2 and P3 parametrizations, respectively, suggesting a mild evolution for\n$\\gamma(z)$. By repeating the analysis with Type Ia Supernovae from JLA\ncompilation, GRBs and SGL systems this mild evolution is reinforced.\n", "  Continuous-variable systems in quantum theory can be fully described through\nany one of the ${\\rm s}$-ordered family of quasiprobabilities $\\Lambda_{\\rm\ns}(\\alpha)$, ${\\rm s} \\in [-1,1]$. We ask for what values of $({\\rm s}, a)$ is\nthe scaling map $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}(\\alpha) \\rightarrow a^{-2} \\Lambda_{\\rm\ns}(a^{-1}\\alpha)$ a positive map? Our analysis based on a duality we establish\nsettles this issue (i) the scaling map generically fails to be positive,\nshowing that there is no useful entanglement witness of the scaling type beyond\nthe transpose map, and (ii) in the two particular cases $({\\rm s}=1, |a| \\leq\n1)$ and $({\\rm s}=-1, |a| \\geq 1)$, and only in these two non-trivial cases,\nthe map is not only positive but also completely positive as seen through the\nnoiseless attenuator and amplifier channels. We also present a `phase diagram'\nfor the behaviour of the scaling maps in the ${\\rm s}-a$ parameter space with\nregard to its positivity, obtained from the viewpoint of symmetric-ordered\ncharacteristic functions. This also sheds light on similar diagrams for the\npractically relevant attenuation and amplification maps with respect to the\nnoise parameter, especially in the range below the complete-positivity (or\nquantum-limited) threshold.\n", "  The $J_1-J_2$ spin chain model with nearest neighbor $J_1$ and next nearest\nneighbor anti-ferromagnetic $J_2$ interaction is one of the most popular\nfrustrated magnetic models. This model system has been extensively studied\ntheoretically and applied to explain the magnetic properties of the real\nlow-dimensional materials. However, existence of different phases for the\n$J_1-J_2$ model in an axial magnetic field $h$ is either not understood or has\nbeen controversial. In this paper we show the existence of higher order $p>4$\nmultipolar phase near the critical point $(J_2/J_1)_c=-0.25$. The criterion to\ndetect the quadrupolar or spin nematic (SN)/spin density wave of type two\n(SDW$_2$) phase using the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiment data is\nalso discussed, and INS data of LiCuVO$_4$ compound is modelled. We discuss the\ndimerized and degenerate ground state in the quadrupolar phase. The major\ncontribution of binding energy in the spin-1/2 system comes from the\nlongitudinal component of the nearest neighbor bonds. We also study spin\nnematic/SDW$_2$ phase in spin-1 system in large $J_2/J_1$ limit.\n", "  We construct a model where the smallness of the masses of first quark\ngenerations implies the near block diagonal nature of the CKM matrix and\nvice-versa. For this set-up, we rely on a 2HDM structure with an $S_3$\nsymmetry. We show that an SM-like Higgs emerges naturally from such a\nconstruction. Moreover, the ratio of two VEVs, $\\tan\\beta$ can be precisely\ndetermined from the requirement of the near masslessness of the up- and\ndown-quarks. The FCNC structure that arises from our model is also very\npredictive.\n", "  Combining measurements on the expansion history of the Universe and on the\ngrowth rate of cosmic structures is key to discriminate between alternative\ncosmological frameworks and to test gravity. Recently, Linder (2017) proposed a\nnew diagram to investigate the joint evolutionary track of these two\nquantities. In this letter, we collect the most recent cosmic growth and\nexpansion rate datasets to provide the state-of-the-art observational\nconstraints on this diagram. By performing a joint statistical analysis of both\nprobes, we test the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model, confirming a mild tension\nbetween cosmic microwave background predictions from Planck mission and cosmic\ngrowth measurements at low redshift ($z<2$). Then we test alternative models\nallowing the variation of one single cosmological parameter at a time. In\nparticular, we find a larger growth index than the one predicted by general\nrelativity $\\gamma=0.65^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$). However, also a standard model with\ntotal neutrino mass of $0.26\\pm0.10$ eV provides a similarly accurate\ndescription of the current data. By simulating an additional dataset consistent\nwith next-generation dark-energy mission forecasts, we show that growth rate\nconstraints at $z>1$ will be crucial to discriminate between alternative\nmodels.\n", "  We report on the alteration of photon emission properties of a single trapped\nion coupled to a high finesse optical fiber cavity. We show that the vacuum\nfield of the cavity can simultaneously affect the emissions in both the\ninfrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) branches of the $\\Lambda-$type level system\nof $^{40}\\mathrm{Ca}^+$ despite the cavity coupling only to the IR transition.\nThe cavity induces strong emission in the IR transition through the Purcell\neffect resulting in a simultaneous suppression of the UV fluorescence. The\nmeasured suppression of this fluorescence is as large as 66% compared with the\ncase without the cavity. Through analysis of the measurement results, we have\nobtained an ion-cavity coupling of $\\bar{g}_0 = 2\\pi\\cdot (5.3 \\pm 0.1)$ MHz,\nthe largest ever reported so far for a single ion in the IR domain.\n", "  We compute four-point functions of two heavy and two \"perturbatively heavy\"\noperators in the semiclassical limit of Liouville theory on the sphere. We\nobtain these \"Heavy-Heavy-Light-Light\" (HHLL) correlators to leading order in\nthe conformal weights of the light insertions in two ways: (a) via a path\nintegral approach, combining different methods to evaluate correlation\nfunctions from complex solutions for the Liouville field, and (b) via the\nconformal block expansion. This latter approach identifies an integral over the\ncontinuum of normalizable states and a sum over an infinite tower of lighter\ndiscrete states, whose contribution we extract by analytically continuing\nstandard results to our HHLL setting. The sum over this tower reproduces the\nsum over those complex saddlepoints of the path integral that contribute to the\ncorrelator. Our path integral computations reveal that when the two light\noperators are inserted at equal time in radial quantization, the leading-order\nHHLL correlator is independent of their separation, and more generally that at\nthis order there is no short-distance singularity as the two light operators\napproach each other. The conformal block expansion likewise shows that in the\ndiscrete sum short-distance singularities are indeed absent for all\nintermediate states that contribute. In particular, the Virasoro vacuum block,\nwhich would have been singular at short distances, is not exchanged. The\nseparation-independence of equal-time correlators is due to cancelations\nbetween the discrete contributions. These features lead to a Lorentzian\nsingularity that, in conformal theories with anti-de Sitter (AdS) duals, would\nbe associated to locality below the AdS scale.\n", "  The present paper deals with an experimental feasibility study concerning the\ndetection of long- range intermolecular interactions through molecular\ndiffusion behavior in solution. This follows previous analyses, theoretical and\nnumerical, where it was found that inter-biomolecular long-range force fields\nof electrodynamic origin could be detected through deviations from Brownian\ndiffusion. The suggested experimental technique was Fluorescence Correlation\nSpectroscopy (FCS). By con- sidering two oppositely charged molecular species\nin watery solution, that is, Lysozyme protein and a fluorescent dye molecule\n(Alexa488), the diffusion coefficient of the dye has been measured by means of\nthe FCS technique at different values of the concentration of Lysozyme\nmolecules, that is, at different average distances between the oppositely\ncharged molecules. For the model consid- ered long-range interactions are\nbuilt-in as electrostatic forces, the action radius of which can be varied by\nchanging the ionic strength of the solution. The experimental outcomes clearly\nprove the detectability of long-range intermolecular interactions by means of\nthe FCS technique. Molecular Dynamics simulations provide a clear and\nunambiguous interpretation of the experimental results.\n", "  Athermal disordered systems can exhibit a remarkable response to an applied\noscillatory shear: after a relatively few shearing cycles, the system falls\ninto a configuration that had already been visited in a previous cycle. After\nthis point the system repeats its dynamics periodically despite undergoing many\nparticle rearrangements during each cycle. We study the behavior of orbits as\nwe approach the jamming point in simulations of jammed particles subject to\noscillatory shear at fixed pressure and zero temperature. As the pressure is\nlowered, we find that it becomes more common for the system to find periodic\nstates where it takes multiple cycles before returning to a previously visited\nstate. Thus, there is a proliferation of longer periods as the jamming point is\napproached.\n", "  We introduce an $\\imath \\epsilon$ prescription for the SYK model both at\nfinite and at zero temperature. This prescription regularizes all the naive\nultraviolet divergences of the model. As expected the prescription breaks the\nconformal invariance, but the latter is restored in the $\\epsilon \\to 0$ limit.\nWe prove rigorously that the Schwinger Dyson equation of the resummed two point\nfunction at large $N$ and low momentum is recovered in this limit. Based on\nthis $\\imath \\epsilon$ prescription we introduce an effective field theory\nLagrangian for the infrared SYK model.\n", "  Population synthesis models of planetary systems developed during the last\n$\\sim$15 years could reproduce several of the observables of the exoplanet\npopulation, and also allowed to constrain planetary formation models. We\npresent our planet formation model, which calculates the evolution of a\nplanetary system during the gaseous phase. The code incorporates relevant\nphysical phenomena for the formation of a planetary system, like\nphotoevaporation, planet migration, gas accretion, water delivery in embryos\nand planetesimals, a detailed study of the orbital evolution of the\nplanetesimal population, and the treatment of the fusion between embryos,\nconsidering their atmospheres. The main goal of this work, unlike other works\nof planetary population synthesis, is to find suitable scenarios and physical\nparameters of the disc to form solar system analogs. We are specially\ninterested in the final planet distributions, and in the final surface density,\neccentricity and inclination profiles for the planetesimal population. These\nfinal distributions will be used as initial conditions for N-body simulations,\nto study the post-oligarchic formation in a second work. We then consider\ndifferent formation scenarios, with different planetesimal sizes and different\ntype I migration rates. We find that solar system analogs are favored in\nmassive discs, with low type I migration rates, and small planetesimal sizes.\nBesides, those rocky planets within their habitables zones are dry when discs\ndissipate. At last, the final configurations of solar system analogs include\ninformation about the mass and semimajor-axis of the planets, water contents,\nand the properties of the planetesimal remnants.\n", "  To investigate the electronic structure of Weyl semimetals Ta$Pn$ ($Pn=$P,\nAs), optical conductivity [$\\sigma(\\omega)$] spectra are measured over a wide\nrange of photon energies and temperatures, and these measured values are\ncompared with band calculations. Two significant structures can be observed: a\nbending structure at $\\hbar\\omega\\sim$85 meV in TaAs, and peaks at\n$\\hbar\\omega\\sim$ 50 meV (TaP) and $\\sim$30 meV (TaAs). The bending structure\ncan be explained by the interband transition between saddle points connecting a\nset of $W_2$ Weyl points. The temperature dependence of the peak intensity can\nbe fitted by assuming the interband transition between saddle points connecting\na set of $W_1$ Weyl points. Owing to the different temperature dependence of\nthe Drude weight in both materials, it is found that the Weyl points of TaAs\nare located near the Fermi level, whereas those of TaP are further away.\n", "  Context. Reliable metallicity values for M dwarfs are important for studies\nof the chemical evolution and advancement of planet formation theory in\nlow-mass environments. Historically the determination of stellar parameters of\nlow-mass stars has been challenging due to the low surface temperature, causing\nseveral molecules to form in the photospheric layers. In our work we use the\nfact that infrared high-resolution spectrographs have opened up a new window\nfor investigating M dwarfs.\n  Aims. Metallicity determination using high-resolution spectra is more\naccurate than the use of low-resolution spectra, but rather time-consuming. In\nthis paper we expand our sample analyzed with this precise method both in\nmetallicity and effective temperature in order to build up a calibration sample\nfor a future revised empirical calibration.\n  Methods. Because of the relatively few molecular lines in the J-band,\ncontinuum rectification is possible for high-resolution spectra, allowing the\nstellar parameters to be determined with greater accuracy than using optical\nspectra. The metallicity was determined using synthetic spectral fitting of\nseveral atomic species.\n  Results. We have analyzed sixteen targets, with a range of effective\ntemperature from 3350-4550 K. The resulting metallicities lie between -0.5 <\n[M/H] < +0.4. A few targets have previously been analyzed using low-resolution\nspectra, and we find a rather good agreement with our values. A comparison with\navailable photometric calibrations shows varying agreement, and the spread\nwithin all empirical calibrations is large.\n  Conclusions. Including the targets from our previous paper, we have analyzed\n28 M dwarfs using high-resolution infrared spectra. The targets spread\napproximately one dex in metallicity and 1400 K in effective temperature. For\nindividual M dwarfs we achieve uncertainties of 0.05 dex and 100 K on average.\n", "  We calculate the A.C. optical response to circularly polarized light of a\nWeyl semimetal (WSM) with varying amounts of tilt of the Dirac cones. Both\ntype-I and II (overtilted) WSM are considered in a continuum model with broken\ntime reversal (TR) symmetry. The Weyl nodes appear in pairs of equal energies\nbut of opposite momentum and chirality. For type-I the response of a particular\nnode to right (RHP) and left (LHP) hand polarized light are distinct only in a\nlimited range of photon energy $\\Omega$,\n$\\frac{2}{1+C_{2}/v}<\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mu}<\\frac{2}{1-C_{2}/v}$ with $\\mu$ the\nchemical potential and $C_{2}$ the tilt associated with the positive chirality\nnode assuming the two nodes are oppositely tilted. For the over tilted case\n(type-II) the same lower bound applies but there is no upper bound. If the tilt\nis reversed the RHP and LHP response are also reversed. We present\ncorresponding results for the Hall angle.\n", "  We propose an interpretation of the expansion and acceleration of the\nUniverse from an information theoretic viewpoint. We obtain the time evolution\nof the configuration entropy of the mass distribution in a static Universe and\nshow that the process of gravitational instability leads to a rapid dissipation\nof configuration entropy during the growth of the density fluctuations making\nsuch a Universe entropically unfavourable. We find that in an expanding\nUniverse, the configuration entropy rate is governed by the expansion rate of\nthe Universe and the growth rate of density fluctuations. The configuration\nentropy rate becomes smaller but still remains negative in a matter dominated\nUniverse and eventually becomes zero at some future time in a $\\Lambda$\ndominated Universe. The configuration entropy may have a connection to the dark\nenergy and possibly plays a driving role in the current accelerating expansion\nof the Universe leading the Universe to its maximum entropy configuration.\n", "  Time series observations of the dwarf planet Haumea and the Plutinos 2003VS2\nand 2003AZ84 with Herschel/PACS are presented in this work. Thermal emission of\nthese trans-Neptunian objects were acquired as part of the TNOs are Cool\nHerschel Space Observatory key programme. We search for the thermal light\ncurves at 100 and 160um of Haumea and 2003AZ84, and at 70 and 160um for 2003VS2\nby means of photometric analysis of the PACS data. The goal of this work is to\nuse these thermal light curves to obtain physical and thermophysical properties\nof these icy Solar System bodies. Haumea's thermal light curve is clearly\ndetected at 100 and 160um. The effect of the reported dark spot is apparent at\n100um. Different thermophysical models were applied to these light curves,\nvarying the thermophysical properties of the surface within and outside the\nspot. Although no model gives a perfect fit to the thermal observations,\nresults imply an extremely low thermal inertia (< 0.5 MKS) and a high phase\nintegral (> 0.73) for Haumea's surface. We note that the dark spot region\nappears to be only weakly different from the rest of the object, with modest\nchanges in thermal inertia and/or phase integral. The thermal light curve of\n2003VS2 is not firmly detected at 70 and at 160um but a thermal inertia of\n2+/-0.5 MKS can be derived from these data. The thermal light curve of 2003AZ84\nis not firmly detected at 100um. We apply a thermophysical model to the mean\nthermal fluxes and to all the Herschel/PACS and Spitzer/MIPS thermal data of\n2003AZ84, obtaining a close to pole-on orientation as the most likely for this\nTNO. For the three TNOs, the thermal inertias derived from light curve analyses\nor from the thermophysical analysis of the mean thermal fluxes confirm the\ngenerally small or very small surface thermal inertias of the TNO population,\nwhich is consistent with a statistical mean value of 2.5+/-0.5 MKS.\n", "  The formation of vortices is usually considered to be the main mechanism of\nangular momentum disposal in superfluids. Recently, it was predicted that a\nsuperfluid can acquire angular momentum via an alternative, microscopic route\n-- namely, through interaction with rotating impurities, forming so-called\n`angulon quasiparticles' [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 203001 (2015)]. The angulon\ninstabilities correspond to transfer of a small number of angular momentum\nquanta from the impurity to the superfluid, as opposed to vortex instabilities,\nwhere angular momentum is quantized in units of $\\hbar$ per atom. Furthermore,\nsince conventional impurities (such as molecules) represent three-dimensional\n(3D) rotors, the angular momentum transferred is intrinsically 3D as well, as\nopposed to a merely planar rotation which is inherent to vortices. Herein we\nshow that the angulon theory can explain the anomalous broadening of the\nspectroscopic lines observed for CH$_3$ and NH$_3$ molecules in superfluid\nhelium nanodroplets, thereby providing a fingerprint of the emerging angulon\ninstabilities in experiment.\n", "  We report the trapping of ultracold 87Rb atoms in a 0.7 micron-period 2D\ntriangular magnetic lattice on an atom chip. The magnetic lattice is created by\na lithographically patterned magnetic Co/Pd multilayer film plus bias fields.\nRubidium atoms in the F=1, mF=-1 low-field seeking state are trapped at\nestimated distances down to about 100 nm from the chip surface and with\ncalculated mean trapping frequencies as high as 800 kHz. The measured lifetimes\nof the atoms trapped in the magnetic lattice are in the range 0.4 - 1.7 ms,\ndepending on distance from the chip surface. Model calculations suggest the\ntrap lifetimes are currently limited mainly by losses due to surface-induced\nthermal evaporation following loading of the atoms from the Z-wire trap into\nthe very tight magnetic lattice traps, rather than by fundamental loss\nprocesses such as surface interactions, three-body recombination or spin flips\ndue to Johnson magnetic noise. The trapping of atoms in a 0.7 micrometer-period\nmagnetic lattice represents a significant step towards using magnetic lattices\nfor quantum tunneling experiments and to simulate condensed matter and\nmany-body phenomena in nontrivial lattice geometries.\n", "  A new generation of interferometric instruments is emerging which aim to use\nintensity mapping of redshifted $21\\,$cm radiation to measure the large-scale\nstructure of the Universe at $z\\simeq 1-2$ over wide areas of sky. While these\ninstruments typically have limited angular resolution, they cover huge volumes\nand thus can be used to provide large samples of rare objects. In this paper we\nstudy how well such instruments could find spatially extended large-scale\nstructures, such as cosmic voids, using a matched filter formalism. Such a\nformalism allows us to work in Fourier space, the natural space for\ninterferometers, and to study the impact of finite $u-v$ coverage, noise and\nforegrounds on our ability to recover voids. We find that in the absence of\nforegrounds such instruments would provide enormous catalogs of voids, with\nhigh completeness, but that control of foregrounds is key to realizing this\ngoal.\n", "  We report the discovery of eclipses by circumstellar disc material associated\nwith the young star PDS 110 in the Ori OB1a association using the SuperWASP and\nKELT surveys. PDS 110 (HD 290380, IRAS 05209-0107) is a rare Fe/Ge-type star, a\n~10 Myr-old accreting intermediate-mass star showing strong infrared excess\n(L$_{\\rm IR}$/L$_{\\rm bol}$ ~ 0.25). Two extremely similar eclipses with a\ndepth of ~30\\% and duration ~25 days were observed in November 2008 and January\n2011. We interpret the eclipses as caused by the same structure with an orbital\nperiod of $808\\pm2$ days. Shearing over a single orbit rules out diffuse dust\nclumps as the cause, favouring the hypothesis of a companion at ~2AU. The\ncharacteristics of the eclipses are consistent with transits by an unseen\nlow-mass (1.8-70M$_{Jup}$) planet or brown dwarf with a circum-secondary disc\nof diameter ~0.3 AU. The next eclipse event is predicted to take place in\nSeptember 2017 and could be monitored by amateur and professional observatories\nacross the world.\n", "  Terrestrial planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of low-mass stars and cool\ndwarfs have received significant scrutiny recently because their shorter\norbital periods increase their chances of detection and characterization\ncompared to planets around G-dwarfs. As these planets are likely tidal-locked,\nimproved 3D numerical simulations of such planetary atmospheres are needed to\nguide target selection. Here we use a 3-D climate system model, updated with\nnew water-vapor absorption coefficients derived from the HITRAN 2012 database,\nto study ocean covered planets at the inner edge of the HZ around late-M to\nmid-K stars ($2600$ K <= Teff <= 4500K). Our results indicate that these\nupdated water-vapor coefficients result in significant warming compared to\nprevious studies, so the inner HZ around M-dwarfs is not as close as suggested\nby earlier work. Assuming synchronously rotating planets with background 1 bar\nN2 atmospheres, we find that planets at the inner HZ of stars with Teff > 3000K\nundergo the classical \"moist-greenhouse\" (H2O mixing ratio > 10-3 in the\nstratosphere) at significantly lower surface temperature (~ 280K) in our 3-D\nmodel compared with 1-D climate models (~ 340K). This implies that some planets\naround low mass stars can simultaneously undergo water-loss and remain\nhabitable. However, for star with Teff <= 3000K, planets at the inner HZ may\ndirectly transition to a runaway state, while bypassing the moist greenhouse\nwater-loss entirely. We analyze transmission spectra of planets in a moist\ngreen-house regime, and find that there are several prominent H2O features\nwithin JWST instruments range. Thus, relying only upon standard Earth-analog\nspectra with 24-hour rotation period around M-dwarfs for habitability studies\nwill miss the strong H2O features that one would expect to see on synchronously\nrotating planets around M-dwarf stars, with JWST.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the scattering of few photon light on\nBose-Hubbard lattices using diagrammatic scattering theory. We explicitly\nderive general analytical expressions for the lowest order photonic correlation\nfunctions, which we apply numerically to several different lattices. We focus\nspecifically on non-linear effects visible in the intensity-intensity\ncorrelation function and explain bunching and anti-bunching effects in dimers,\nchains, rings and planes. The numerical implementation can be applied to\narbitrary Bose-Hubbard graphs, and we provide it as an attachment to this\npublication.\n", "  We report a study of the CUORE sensitivity to neutrinoless double beta\n($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decay. We used a Bayesian analysis based on a toy Monte\nCarlo (MC) approach to extract the exclusion sensitivity to the\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay half-life ($T_{1/2}^{0\\nu}$) at $90\\%$ credibility\ninterval (CI) -- i.e. the interval containing the true value of\n$T_{1/2}^{0\\nu}$ with $90\\%$ probability -- and the $3 \\sigma$ discovery\nsensitivity. We consider various background levels and energy resolutions, and\ndescribe the influence of the data division in subsets with different\nbackground levels. If the background level and the energy resolution meet the\nexpectation, CUORE will reach a $90\\%$ CI exclusion sensitivity of\n$2\\cdot10^{25}$ yr with $3$ months, and $9\\cdot10^{25}$ yr with $5$ years of\nlive time. Under the same conditions, the discovery sensitivity after $3$\nmonths and $5$ years will be $7\\cdot10^{24}$ yr and $4\\cdot10^{25}$ yr,\nrespectively.\n", "  It remains an open question how realist view of macroscopic world emerges\nfrom quantum formalism. For testing the macrorealism in quantum domain, an\ninteresting approach was put forward by Leggett and Garg in $1985$, by\nformulating a suitable inequality valid for any macrorealistic theory.\nRecently, by following the Wigner idea of local realist inequality, a\nprobabilistic version of standard Leggett-Garg inequalities have also been\nproposed. While the Wigner form of local realist inequalities are equivalent to\nthe two-party, two-measurements and two outcomes CHSH inequalities, in this\npaper we provide a generic proof to demonstrate that the Wigner form of\nLeggett-Garg inequalities are not only inequivalent to the standard ones but\nalso stronger than the later. This is demonstrated by quantifying the amount of\ndisturbance caused by a prior measurement to the subsequent measurements. In\nthis connection, the relation between LGIs and another formulation of\nmacrorealism known as no-signaling in time is examined.\n", "  NGC 6231 is a young cluster (age ~2-7 Myr) dominating the Sco OB1 association\n(distance ~1.59 kpc) with ~100 O and B stars and a large pre-main-sequence\nstellar population. We combine a reanalysis of archival Chandra X-ray data with\nmulti-epoch NIR photometry from the VVV survey and published optical catalogs\nto obtain a catalog of 2148 probable cluster members. This catalog is 70%\nlarger than previous censuses of probable cluster members in NGC 6231, and it\nincludes many low-mass stars detected in the NIR but not in the optical and\nsome B-stars without previously noted X-ray counterparts. In addition, we\nidentify 295 NIR variables, about half of which are expected to be\npre-main-sequence stars. With the more-complete sample, we estimate a total\npopulation in the Chandra field of 5700-7500 cluster members down to 0.08\n$M_\\odot$ (assuming a universal initial mass function) with a completeness\nlimit at 0.5 $M_\\odot$. A decrease in stellar X-ray luminosities is noted\nrelative to other younger clusters. However, within the cluster, there is\nlittle variation in the distribution of X-ray luminosities for ages less than 5\nMyr. X-ray spectral hardness for B stars may be useful for distinguishing\nbetween early-B stars with X-rays generated in stellar winds and B-star systems\nwith X-rays from a pre-main-sequence companions (>35% of B stars). A small\nfraction of pre-main-sequence stars have unusually high X-ray median energies\nor reddened near-infrared colors, which might be explained by absorption from\nthick or edge-on disks or being a background field star.\n", "  Quantized magnetic vortices driven by electric current determine key\nelectromagnetic properties of superconductors. While the dynamic behavior of\nslow vortices has been thoroughly investigated, the physics of ultrafast\nvortices under strong currents remains largely unexplored. Here we use a\nnanoscale scanning superconducting quantum interference device to image\nvortices penetrating into a superconducting Pb film at rates of tens of GHz and\nmoving with velocities up to tens of km/s, which are not only much larger than\nthe speed of sound but also exceed the pair-breaking speed limit of\nsuperconducting condensate. These experiments reveal formation of mesoscopic\nvortex channels which undergo cascades of bifurcations as the current and\nmagnetic field increase. Our numerical simulations predict metamorphosis of\nfast Abrikosov vortices into mixed Abrikosov-Josephson vortices at even higher\nvelocities. This work offers an insight into the fundamental physics of dynamic\nvortex states of superconductors at high current densities, crucial for many\napplications.\n", "  Recently, the existence of robust three-dimensional light bullets (LBs) was\npredicted theoretically in the output of a laser coupled to a distant saturable\nabsorber. In this manuscript, we analyze the stability and the range of\nexistence of these dissipative localized structures and provide guidelines and\nrealistic parameter sets for their experimental observation. In order to reduce\nthe complexity of the analysis, we first approximate the three-dimensional\nproblem by a reduced equation governing the dynamics of the transverse profile.\nThis effective theory provides an intuitive picture of the LB formation\nmechanism. Moreover, it allows us to perform a detailed multi-parameter\nbifurcation study and to identify the different mechanisms of instability. It\nis found that the LBs experience dominantly either homogeneous oscillation or\nsymmetry breaking transversal waves radiation. In addition, our analysis\nreveals several non-intuitive scaling behaviors as functions of the linewidth\nenhancement factors and the saturation parameters. Our results are confirmed by\ndirect numerical simulations of the full system.\n", "  In this article we present results of the study on the association between\nthe muon flux variation at ground level, registered by the\n\\textit{\\textit{New-Tupi}} muon telescopes ($22^0 53'00''S,\\; 43^0 06'13'W$; 3\nm above sea level) and a geomagnetic storm of 25\\,--\\,29 August 2015 that has\nraged for several days as a result of a coronal mass ejection (CME) impact on\nEarth's magnetosphere. A sequence of events started with an M3.5 X-ray class\nflare on 22 August 2015 at 21:19 UTC. The \\textit{\\textit{New-Tupi}} muon\ntelescopes observed a Forbush decrease (FD) triggered by this geomagnetic\nstorm, with onset on 26 August 2015. After the Earth crossed a heliospheric\ncurrent sheet (HCS), an increase in the particle flux was observed on 28 August\n2015 by spacecrafts and ground level detectors. The observed peak was in\ntemporal coincidence with the impact of a high speed stream (HSS). We study\nthis increase, that has been observed with a significance above 1.5\\% by ground\nlevel detectors in different rigidity regimes. We also estimate the lower limit\nof the energy fluence injected on Earth. In addition, we consider the origin of\nthis increase, such as acceleration of particles by shock waves on the front of\nthe HSS and the focusing effect of the HCS crossing. Our results show possible\nevidence of a prolonged energetic (up to GeV energies) particle injection\nwithin the Earth atmosphere system, driven by the HSS. In most cases these\ninjected particles are directed to polar regions. However, the particles from\nthe high energy tail of the spectrum can reach middle latitudes, and that could\nhave consequences for the atmospheric chemistry, for instance, the creation of\nNOx species may be enhanced and can lead to increased ozone depletion. This\ntopic requires further study.\n", "  We propose a Higgs-related but spin $1/2$ dark matter candidate with a mass\nthat is comparable to that of the Higgs. This particle is a WIMP with an\nR-parity of $-1$, but it can be distinguished from a neutralino by its\nunconventional couplings to W and Z bosons. Charged spin 1/2 particles of a new\nkind are also predicted at higher energy.\n", "  Hi-GAL is a large-scale survey of the Galactic plane, performed with Herschel\nin five infrared continuum bands between 70 and 500 $\\mu$m. We present a\nband-merged catalogue of spatially matched sources and their properties derived\nfrom fits to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and heliocentric\ndistances, based on the photometric catalogs presented in Molinari et al.\n(2016a), covering the portion of Galactic plane $-71.0^{\\circ}< \\ell <\n67.0^{\\circ}$. The band-merged catalogue contains 100922 sources with a regular\nSED, 24584 of which show a 70 $\\mu$m counterpart and are thus considered\nproto-stellar, while the remainder are considered starless. Thanks to this huge\nnumber of sources, we are able to carry out a preliminary analysis of early\nstages of star formation, identifying the conditions that characterise\ndifferent evolutionary phases on a statistically significant basis. We\ncalculate surface densities to investigate the gravitational stability of\nclumps and their potential to form massive stars. We also explore evolutionary\nstatus metrics such as the dust temperature, luminosity and bolometric\ntemperature, finding that these are higher in proto-stellar sources compared to\npre-stellar ones. The surface density of sources follows an increasing trend as\nthey evolve from pre-stellar to proto-stellar, but then it is found to decrease\nagain in the majority of the most evolved clumps. Finally, we study the\nphysical parameters of sources with respect to Galactic longitude and the\nassociation with spiral arms, finding only minor or no differences between the\naverage evolutionary status of sources in the fourth and first Galactic\nquadrants, or between \"on-arm\" and \"inter-arm\" positions.\n", "  We numerically investigated how the nonlinear dynamics depends on the\ndimensionality and on the higher-order curvature corrections in the form of\nGauss-Bonnet (GB) terms. We especially monitored the processes of appearances\nof a singularity (or black hole) in two models: (i) a perturbed wormhole throat\nin spherically symmetric space-time, and (ii) colliding scalar pulses in\nplane-symmetric space-time. We used a dual-null formulation for evolving the\nfield equations, which enables us to locate the trapping horizons directly, and\nalso enables us to follow close to the large-curvature region due to its causal\nintegrating scheme. We observed that the fate of a perturbed wormhole is either\na black hole or an expanding throat depending on the total energy of the\nstructure, and its threshold depends on the coupling constant of the GB terms\n($\\alpha_{\\rm GB}$). We also observed that a collision of large scalar pulses\nwill produce a large-curvature region, of which the magnitude also depends on\n$\\alpha_{\\rm GB}$. For both models, the normal corrections ($\\alpha_{\\rm\nGB}>0$) work for avoiding the appearance of singularity, although it is\ninevitable. We also found that in the critical situation for forming a black\nhole, the existence of the trapped region in the Einstein-GB gravity does not\ndirectly indicate the formation of a black hole.\n", "  Effective temperatures and luminosities are calculated for 1,475,921 Tycho-2\nand 107,145 Hipparcos stars, based on distances from Gaia Data Release 1.\nParameters are derived by comparing multi-wavelength archival photometry to\nBT-Settl model atmospheres. The 1-sigma uncertainties for the Tycho-2 and\nHipparcos stars are +/-137 K and +/-125 K in temperature and +/-35 per cent and\n+/-19 per cent in luminosity. The luminosity uncertainty is dominated by that\nof the Gaia parallax. Evidence for infrared excess between 4.6 and 25 microns\nis found for 4256 stars, of which 1883 are strong candidates. These include\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, Cepheids, Herbig Ae/Be stars, young\nstellar objects, and other sources. We briefly demonstrate the capabilities of\nthis dataset by exploring local interstellar extinction, the onset of dust\nproduction in AGB stars, the age and metallicity gradients of the solar\nneighbourhood and structure within the Gould Belt. We close by discussing the\npotential impact of future Gaia data releases.\n", "  We present ARC2 (Astrophysically Robust Correction 2), an open-source\nPython-based systematics-correction pipeline to correct for the Kepler prime\nmission long cadence light curves. The ARC2 pipeline identifies and corrects\nany isolated discontinuities in the light curves, then removes trends common to\nmany light curves. These trends are modelled using the publicly available\nco-trending basis vectors, within an (approximate) Bayesian framework with\n`shrinkage' priors to minimise the risk of over-fitting and the injection of\nany additional noise into the corrected light curves, while keeping any\nastrophysical signals intact. We show that the ARC2 pipeline's performance\nmatches that of the standard Kepler PDC-MAP data products using standard noise\nmetrics, and demonstrate its ability to preserve astrophysical signals using\ninjection tests with simulated stellar rotation and planetary transit signals.\nAlthough it is not identical, the ARC2 pipeline can thus be used as an open\nsource alternative to PDC-MAP, whenever the ability to model the impact of the\nsystematics removal process on other kinds of signal is important.\n", "  A new generation of surveys will soon map large fractions of sky to ever\ngreater depths and their science goals can be enhanced by exploiting cross\ncorrelations between them. In this paper we study cross correlations between\nthe lensing of the CMB and biased tracers of large-scale structure at high $z$.\nWe motivate the need for more sophisticated bias models for modeling\nincreasingly biased tracers at these redshifts and propose the use of\nperturbation theories, specifically Convolution Lagrangian Effective Field\nTheory ({\\sc CLEFT}). Since such signals reside at large scales and redshifts,\nthey can be well described by perturbative approaches. We compare our model\nwith the current approach of using scale independent bias coupled with fitting\nfunctions for non-linear matter power spectra, showing that the latter will not\nbe sufficient for upcoming surveys. We illustrate our ideas by estimating\n$\\sigma_8$ from the auto- and cross-spectra of mock surveys, finding that {\\sc\nCLEFT} returns accurate and unbiased results at high $z$. We discuss\nuncertainties due to the redshift distribution of the tracers, and several\navenues for future development.\n", "  We investigate the spin-dependent (naive) T-odd fragmentation function\n$D^\\perp_{1T}$, which can provide an explanation on the transverse polarization\nof the $\\Lambda^0$ hyperon produced in an unpolarized process. We calculate\n$D^\\perp_{1T}$ for light flavors in the spectator diquark model, with a\nGaussian form factor at the hyperon-quark-diquark vertex. We include in the\ncalculation both the scalar diquark and axial-vector diquark spectators. We\ndetermine the values of the model parameters by fitting the unpolarized\nfragmentation function $D^\\Lambda_1$ to the DSV parametrization for\n$D^\\Lambda_1$. In addition, we compute the longitudinal polarization\nfragmentation function $G^\\Lambda_1$ and compare it with the known\nparametrization of $G^\\Lambda_1$. We also estimate the transverse polarizations\nof $\\Lambda$ production, in both semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and\nsingle inclusive $e^+e^-$ annihilation.\n", "  Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are potential solutions for grid-scale energy\nstorage, and deeper understanding of the effect of flow rate on RFB performance\nis needed to develop efficient, low-cost designs. In this study we highlight\nthe importance of modeling tanks, which can limit the charge/discharge capacity\nof redox-active polymer (RAP) based RFBs. The losses due to tank mixing\ndominate over the polarization-induced capacity losses that arise due to\nresistive processes in the reactor. A porous electrode model is used to\nseparate these effects by predicting the time variation of active species\nconcentration in electrodes and tanks. A simple transient model based on\nspecies conservation laws developed in this study reveals that charge\nutilization and polarization are affected by two dimensionless numbers\nquantifying (1) flow rate relative to stoichiometric flow and (2) size of flow\nbattery tanks relative to the reactor. The RFB's utilization is shown to\nincrease monotonically with flow rate, reaching 90% of the theoretical value\nonly when flow rate exceeds twenty-fold of the stoichiometric value. We also\nidentify polarization due to irreversibilities inherent to RFB architecture as\na result of tank mixing and current distribution internal to the reactor, and\nthis polarization dominates over that resulting from ohmic resistances\nparticularly when cycling RFBs at low flow rates and currents. These findings\nare summarized in a map of utilization and polarization that can be used to\nselect adequate flow rate for a given tank size.\n", "  We report a comprehensive search for hierarchical triple stellar system\ncandidates amongst eclipsing binaries (EB) observed by the CoRoT spacecraft. We\ncalculate and check eclipse timing variation (ETV) diagrams for almost 1500 EBs\nin an automated manner. We identify five relatively short-period Algol systems\nfor which our combined light curve and complex ETV analyses (including both the\nlight-travel time effect and short-term dynamical third-body perturbations)\nresulted in consistent third-body solutions. The computed periods of the outer\nbodies are between 82 and 272 days, (with an alternative solution of 831 days\nfor one of the targets). We find that the inner and outer orbits are near\ncoplanar in all but one case. The dynamical masses of the outer subsystems\ndetermined from the ETV analyses are consistent with both the results of our\nlight curve analyses and the spectroscopic information available in the\nliterature. One of our candidate systems exhibits outer eclipsing events as\nwell, the locations of which are in good agreement with the ETV solution. We\nalso report another certain triply eclipsing triple system which, however, is\nlacking a reliable ETV solution due to the very short time range of the data,\nand four new blended systems (composite light curves of 2 eclipsing binaries\neach), where we cannot decide whether the components are gravitationally binded\nor not. Amongst these blended systems we identify the longest period and\nhighest eccentricity eclipsing binary in the entire CoRoT sample.\n", "  We aim to understand how stellar parameters such as mass and rotation impact\nthe distribution of starspots on the stellar surface. To this purpose, we have\nused Doppler imaging to reconstruct the surface brightness distributions of\nthree fully convective M dwarfs with similar rotation rates. We secured high\ncadence spectral time series observations of the 5.5 AU separation binary GJ\n65, comprising GJ 65A (M5.5V, Prot = 0.24 d) and GJ 65B (M6V, Prot = 0.23 d).\nWe also present new observations of GJ 791.2A (M4.5V, Prot = 0.31 d).\nObservations of each star were made on two nights with UVES, covering a\nwavelength range from 0.64 - 1.03 microns. The time series spectra reveal\nmultiple line distortions, which we interpret as cool starspots and which are\npersistent on both nights suggesting stability on the timescale of 3 days.\nSpots are recovered with resolutions down to 8.3 degs at the equator. The\nglobal spot distributions for GJ 791.2A are similar to observations made a year\nearlier. Similar high latitude and circumpolar spot structure is seen on\nGJ791.2A and GJ 65A. However, they are surprisingly absent on GJ 65B, which\ninstead reveals more extensive, larger, spots concentrated at intermediate\nlatitudes. All three stars show small amplitude latitude-dependent rotation\nthat is consistent with solid body rotation. We compare our measurements of\ndifferential rotation with previous Doppler imaging studies and discuss the\nresults in the wider context of other observational estimates and recent\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  Studying the coupling between the energy output produced by the central\nquasar and the host galaxy is fundamental to fully understand galaxy evolution.\nQuasar feedback is indeed supposed to dramatically affect the galaxy properties\nby depositing large amounts of energy and momentum into the ISM. In order to\ngain further insights on this process, we study the SEDs of sources at the\nbrightest end of the quasar luminosity function, for which the feedback\nmechanism is supposed to be at its maximum. We model the rest-frame UV-to-FIR\nSEDs of 16 WISE-SDSS Selected Hyper-luminous (WISSH) quasars at 1.8 < z < 4.6\ndisentangling the different emission components and deriving physical\nparameters of both the nuclear component and the host galaxy. We also use a\nradiative transfer code to account for the contribution of the quasar-related\nemission to the FIR fluxes. Most SEDs are well described by a standard\ncombination of accretion disk+torus and cold dust emission. However, about 30%\nof them require an additional emission component in the NIR, with temperatures\npeaking at 750K, which indicates the presence of a hotter dust component in\nthese powerful quasars. We measure extreme values of both AGN bolometric\nluminosity (LBOL > 10^47 erg/s) and SFR (up to 2000 Msun/yr). A new relation\nbetween quasar and star-formation luminosity is derived (LSF propto\nLQSO^(0.73)) by combining several Herschel-detected quasar samples from z=0 to\n4. Future observations will be crucial to measure the molecular gas content in\nthese systems, probe the impact between quasar-driven outflows and on-going\nstar-formation, and reveal the presence of merger signatures in their host\ngalaxies.\n", "  We critically reconsider the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) approach to\ncritical phenomena in the presence of gauge symmetries. In the LGW framework,\nto obtain the universal features of a continuous transition, one identifies the\norder parameter Phi and considers the corresponding most general Phi4 field\ntheory that has the same symmetries as the original model. In the presence of\ngauge symmetries, one usually considers a gauge-invariant order parameter and a\nLGW field theory that is invariant under the global symmetries of the original\nmodel. We show that this approach, in which the gauge dynamics is effectively\nintegrated out, may sometimes lead to erroneous conclusions on the nature of\nthe critical behavior. As an explicit example, we show that the above-described\nLGW approach generally fails for the three-dimensional ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic CP(N-1) models, which are invariant under global U(N) and\nlocal U(1) transformations. We point out possible implications for the\nfinite-temperature chiral transition of nuclear matter.\n", "  We analyse four XMM-Newton observations of the neutron-star low-mass X-ray\nbinary EXO 0748$-$676 in quiescence. We fit the spectra with an absorbed\nneutron-star atmosphere model, without the need for a high-energy (power-law)\ncomponent; with a 95 per cent confidence the power-law contributes less than 1\nper cent to the total flux of the source in $0.5-10.0$ keV. The fits show\nsignificant residuals at around 0.5 keV which can be explained by either a hot\ngas component around the neutron star or a moderately broad emission line from\na residual accretion disc. The temperature of the neutron-star has decreased\nsignificantly compared to the previous observation, from 124 eV to 105 eV, with\nthe cooling curve being consistent with either an exponential decay plus a\nconstant or a (broken) power law. The best-fitting neutron-star mass and radius\ncan be better constrained if we extend the fits down to the lowest possible\nenergy available. For an assumed distance of 7.1 kpc, the best-fitting\nneutron-star mass and radius are $2.00_{-0.24}^{+0.07}~M_\\odot$ and\n$11.3_{-1.0}^{+1.3}$ km if we fit the spectrum over the $0.3-10$ keV range, but\n$1.50_{-1.0}^{+0.4}~M_\\odot$ and $12.2_{-3.6}^{+0.8}$ km if we restrict the\nfits to the $0.5-10$ keV range. We finally discuss the effect of the assumed\ndistance to the source upon the best-fitting neutron-star mass and radius. As\nsystematic uncertainties in the deduced mass and radius depending on the\ndistance are much larger than the statistical errors, it would be disingenuous\nto take these results at face value.\n", "  We study the effect of different feedback prescriptions on the properties of\nthe low redshift ($z\\leq1.6$) Ly$\\alpha$ forest using a selection of\nhydrodynamical simulations drawn from the Sherwood simulation suite. The\nsimulations incorporate stellar feedback, AGN feedback and a simplified scheme\nfor efficiently modelling the low column density Ly$\\alpha$ forest. We confirm\na discrepancy remains between Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) observations of\nthe Ly$\\alpha$ forest column density distribution function (CDDF) at $z \\simeq\n0.1$ for high column density systems ($N_{\\rm HI}>10^{14}\\rm\\,cm^{-2}$), as\nwell as Ly$\\alpha$ velocity widths that are too narrow compared to the COS\ndata. Stellar or AGN feedback -- as currently implemented in our simulations --\nhave only a small effect on the CDDF and velocity width distribution. We\nconclude that resolving the discrepancy between the COS data and simulations\nrequires an increase in the temperature of overdense gas with $\\Delta=4$--$40$,\neither through additional He$\\,\\rm \\scriptstyle II\\ $ photo-heating at $z>2$ or\nfine-tuned feedback that ejects overdense gas into the IGM at just the right\ntemperature for it to still contribute significantly to the Ly$\\alpha$ forest.\nAlternatively a larger, currently unresolved turbulent component to the line\nwidth could resolve the discrepancy.\n", "  In this work we first examine transverse and longitudinal fluxes in a $\\cal\nPT$-symmetric photonic dimer using a coupled-mode theory. Several surprising\nunderstandings are obtained from this perspective: The longitudinal flux shows\nthat the $\\cal PT$ transition in a dimer can be regarded as a classical effect,\ndespite its analogy to $\\cal PT$-symmetric quantum mechanics. The longitudinal\nflux also indicates that the so-called giant amplification in the $\\cal\nPT$-symmetric phase is a sub-exponential behavior and does not outperform a\nsingle gain waveguide. The transverse flux, on the other hand, reveals that the\napparent power oscillations between the gain and loss waveguides in the $\\cal\nPT$-symmetric phase can be deceiving in certain cases, where the transverse\npower transfer is in fact unidirectional. We also show that this power transfer\ncannot be arbitrarily fast even when the exceptional point is approached.\nFinally, we go beyond the coupled-mode theory by using the paraxial wave\nequation and also extend our discussions to a $\\cal PT$ diamond and a\none-dimensional periodic lattice.\n", "  We study the correlation length between test quarks with the same electric\nand color charges in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, considering thermal and\nmagnetic effects. We extract the correlation length from the quark correlation\nfunction. The latter is constructed from the probability amplitude to bring a\ngiven quark into the plasma, once a previous one with the same quantum numbers\nis placed at a given distance apart. For temperatures below the transition\ntemperature, the correlation length starts growing as the field strength\nincreases to then decrease for large magnetic fields. For temperatures above\nthe critical temperature, the correlation length continues increasing as the\nfield strength increases. We found that such behavior can be understood as a\ncompetition between the tightening induced by the classical magnetic force\nversus the random thermal motion. For large enough temperatures, the increase\nof the occupation number contributes to the screening of the interaction\nbetween the test particles. The growth of the correlation distance with the\nmagnetic field can be understood as due to the closer proximity between one of\nthe test quarks and the ones popped up from vacuum, which in turn appear due to\nthe increase of the occupation number with temperature.\n", "  In this work, we study the short time dynamics of a molecular junction\ndescribed by Anderson-Holstein model using full-counting statistics after\nprojective measurement. The coupling between the central quantum dot (QD) and\ntwo leads was turned on at remote past and the system is evolved to steady\nstate at time $t=0$, when we perform the projective measurement in one of the\nlead. Generating function for the charge transfer is expressed as a Fredholm\ndeterminant in terms of Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function in the time\ndomain. It is found that the current is not constant at short times indicating\nthat the measurement does perturb the system. We numerically compare the\ncurrent behaviors after the projective measurement with those in the transient\nregime where the subsystems are connected at $t=0$. The universal scaling for\nhigh-order cumulants is observed for the case with zero QD occupation due to\nthe unidirectional transport at short times. The influences of electron-phonon\ninteraction on short time dynamics of electric current, shot noise and\ndifferential conductance are analyzed.\n", "  We study the response of Preisach models of hysteresis to stochastically\nfluctuating external fields. We perform numerical simulations which indicate\nthat analytical expressions derived previously for the autocorrelation\nfunctions and power spectral densities of the Preisach model with uncorrelated\ninput, hold asymptotically also if the external field shows exponentially\ndecaying correlations. As a consequence, the mechanisms causing long-term\nmemory and 1/f-noise in Preisach models with uncorrelated inputs still apply in\nthe presence of fast decaying input correlations. We collect additional\nevidence for the importance of the effective Preisach density previously\nintroduced even for Preisach models with correlated inputs. Additionally, we\npresent some new results for the output of the Preisach model with uncorrelated\ninput using analytical methods. It is found, for instance, that in order to\nproduce the same long-time tails in the output, the elementary hysteresis loops\nof large width need to have a higher weight for the generic Preisach model than\nfor the symmetric Preisach model. Further, we find autocorrelation functions\nand power spectral densities to be monotonically decreasing independently of\nthe choice of input and Preisach density.\n", "  We perform a pilot study of the perturbative renormalization of a\nSupersymmetric gauge theory with matter fields on the lattice. As a specific\nexample, we consider Supersymmetric ${\\cal N}{=}1$ QCD (SQCD). We study the\nself-energies of all particles which appear in this theory, as well as the\nrenormalization of the coupling constant. To this end we compute,\nperturbatively to one-loop, the relevant two-point and three-point Green's\nfunctions using both dimensional and lattice regularizations. Our lattice\nformulation involves the Wilson discretization for the gluino and quark fields;\nfor gluons we employ the Wilson gauge action; for scalar fields (squarks) we\nuse na\\\"ive discretization. The gauge group that we consider is $SU(N_c)$,\nwhile the number of colors, $N_c$, the number of flavors, $N_f$, and the gauge\nparameter, $\\alpha$, are left unspecified.\n  We obtain analytic expressions for the renormalization factors of the\ncoupling constant ($Z_g$) and of the quark ($Z_\\psi$), gluon ($Z_u$), gluino\n($Z_\\lambda$), squark ($Z_{A_\\pm}$), and ghost ($Z_c$) fields on the lattice.\nWe also compute the critical values of the gluino, quark and squark masses.\nFinally, we address the mixing which occurs among squark degrees of freedom\nbeyond tree level: we calculate the corresponding mixing matrix which is\nnecessary in order to disentangle the components of the squark field via an\nadditional finite renormalization.\n", "  Quantum cascaded systems offer the possibility to manipulate a target system\nwith the quantum state of a source system. Here, we study in detail the\ndifferences between a direct quantum cascade and coherent/incoherent driving\nfor the case of two coupled cavity-QED systems. We discuss qualitative\ndifferences between these excitations scenarios, which are particular strong\nfor higher-order photon-photon correlations: $g^{(n)}(0)$ with $ n>2 $. Quantum\ncascaded systems show a behavior differing from the idealized cases of\nindividual coherent/incoherent driving and allow to produce qualitatively\ndifferent quantum statistics. Furthermore, the quantum cascaded driving\nexhibits an interesting mixture of quantum coherent and incoherent excitation\ndynamics. We develop a measure, where the two regimes intermix and quantify\nthese differences via experimentally accessible higher-order photon\ncorrelations.\n", "  Extreme helium stars (EHe stars) are hydrogen-deficient supergiants of\nspectral type A and B. They are believed to result from mergers in double\ndegenerate systems. In this paper we present a detailed quantitative non-LTE\nspectral analysis for BD+10$^\\circ$2179, a prototype of this rare class of\nstars, using UVES and FEROS spectra covering the range from $\\sim$3100 to 10\n000 {\\AA}. Atmosphere model computations were improved in two ways. First,\nsince the UV metal line blanketing has a strong impact on the\ntemperature-density stratification, we used the Atlas12 code. Additionally, We\ntested Atlas12 against the benchmark code Sterne3, and found only small\ndifferences in the temperature and density stratifications, and good agreement\nwith the spectral energy distributions. Second, 12 chemical species were\ntreated in non-LTE. Pronounced non-LTE effects occur in individual spectral\nlines but, for the majority, the effects are moderate to small. The\nspectroscopic parameters give $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ = 17 300$\\pm$300 K and $\\log g$\n= 2.80$\\pm$0.10, and an evolutionary mass of 0.55$\\pm$0.05 $M_\\odot$. The star\nis thus slightly hotter, more compact and less massive than found in previous\nstudies. The kinematic properties imply a thick-disk membership, which is\nconsistent with the metallicity $[$Fe/H$]\\approx-1$ and $\\alpha$-enhancement.\nThe refined light-element abundances are consistent with the white dwarf merger\nscenario. We further discuss the observed helium spectrum in an appendix,\ndetecting dipole-allowed transitions from about 150 multiplets plus the most\ncomprehensive set of known/predicted isolated forbidden components to date.\nMoreover, a so far unreported series of pronounced forbidden He I components is\ndetected in the optical-UV.\n", "  Central depression of nucleonic density, i.e., a reduction of density in the\nnuclear interior, has been attributed to many factors. E.g., bubble structures\nin superheavy (SH) nuclei are believed to be due to the electrostatic\nrepulsion. In light nuclei, the mechanism has been discussed in terms of shell\neffects associated with occupations of s-orbits. The objective of this work is\nto reveal mechanisms behind the formation of central depression in nucleonic\ndensities in light and heavy nuclei. We introduce several measures of the\ninternal nucleonic density. Through the statistical analysis, we study the\ninformation content of these measures with respect to nuclear matter\nproperties. We apply nuclear density functional theory with Skyrme functionals.\nUsing the statistical tools of linear least square regression, we inspect\ncorrelations between various measures of central depression and model\nparameters, including nuclear matter properties. We study bivariate\ncorrelations with selected quantities as well as multiple correlations with\ngroups of parameters. Detailed correlation analysis is carried out for\n$^{34}$Si for which a bubble structure has been reported recently, $^{48}$Ca,\nand N=82, 126, and 184 isotonic chains. We show that the central depression in\nmedium-mass nuclei is very sensitive to shell effects, whereas for SH systems\nit is firmly driven by the electrostatic repulsion. An appreciable semi-bubble\nstructure in proton density is predicted for $^{294}$Og, which is currently the\nheaviest nucleus known experimentally. Our correlation analysis reveals that\nthe central density indicators in nuclei below $^{208}$Pb carry little\ninformation on parameters of nuclear matter; they are predominantly driven by\nshell structure. On the other hand, in the SH nuclei there exists a clear\nrelationship between the central nucleonic density and symmetry energy.\n", "  The production of the elements heavier than iron via slow neutron captures\n(the s process) is a main feature of the contribution of asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) stars of low mass (< 5 Msun) to the chemistry of the cosmos.\nHowever, our understanding of the main neutron source, the 13C(alpha,n)16O\nreaction, is still incomplete. It is commonly assumed that in AGB stars mixing\nbeyond convective borders drives the formation of 13C pockets. However, there\nis no agreement on the nature of such mixing and free parameters are present.\nBy means of a parametric model we investigate the impact of different mixing\nfunctions on the final s-process abundances in low-mass AGB models. Typically,\nchanging the shape of the mixing function or the mass extent of the region\naffected by the mixing produce the same results. Variations in the relative\nabundance distribution of the three s-process peaks (Sr, Ba, and Pb) are\ngenerally within +/-0.2 dex, similar to the observational error bars. We\nconclude that other stellar uncertainties - the effect of rotation and of\novershoot into the C-O core - play a more important role than the details of\nthe mixing function. The exception is at low metallicity, where the Pb\nabundance is significantly affected. In relation to the composition observed in\nstardust SiC grains from AGB stars, the models are relatively close to the data\nonly when assuming the most extreme variation in the mixing profile.\n", "  Antiferromagnetic insulators on the diamond lattice are candidate materials\nto host exotic magnetic phenomena ranging from spin-orbital entanglement to\ndegenerate spiral ground-states and topological paramagnetism. Compared to\nother three-dimensional networks of magnetic ions, such as the geometrically\nfrustrated pyrochlore lattice, the investigation of diamond-lattice magnetism\nin real materials is less mature. In this work, we characterize the magnetic\nproperties of model A-site spinels CoRh2O4 (cobalt rhodite) and CuRh2O4 (copper\nrhodite) by means of thermo-magnetic and neutron scattering measurements and\nperform group theory analysis, Rietveld refinement, mean-field theory, and spin\nwave theory calculations to analyze the experimental results. Our investigation\nreveals that cubic CoRh2O4 is a canonical S=3/2 diamond-lattice Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet with a nearest neighbor exchange J = 0.63 meV and a Neel\nordered ground-state below a temperature of 25 K. In tetragonally distorted\nCuRh2O4, competiting exchange interactions between up to third nearest-neighbor\nspins lead to the development of an incommensurate spin helix at 24 K with a\nmagnetic propagation vector k = (0,0,0.79). Strong reduction of the ordered\nmoment is observed for the S=1/2 spins in CuRh2O4 and captured by our 1/S\ncorrections to the staggered magnetization. Our work identifies CoRh2O4 and\nCuRh2O4 as reference materials to guide future work searching for exotic\nquantum behavior in diamond-lattice antiferromagnets.\n", "  The purpose of this work is two-fold: (1) to quantify the occurrence of\nultra-steep spectrum remnant FRII radio galaxies in a 74 MHz flux limited\nsample, and (2) perform Monte-Carlo simulations of the population of active and\nremnant FRII radio galaxies to confront models of remnant lobe evolution, and\nprovide guidance for further investigation of remnant radio galaxies. We find\nthat fewer than 2$\\%$ of FRII radio galaxies with S$_{ \\rm74~MHz} > 1.5$ Jy are\ncandidate ultra-steep spectrum remnants, where we define ultra-steep spectrum\nas $\\alpha_{\\rm 74~MHz}^{\\rm 1400~MHz} > 1.2$. Our Monte-Carlo simulations\ndemonstrate that models involving Sedov-like expansion in the remnant phase,\nresulting in rapid adiabatic energy losses, are consistent with this upper\nlimit, and predict the existence of nearly twice as many remnants with normal\n(not ultra-steep) spectra in the observed frequency range as there are\nultra-steep spectrum remnants. This model also predicts an ultra-steep remnant\nfraction approaching 10$\\%$ at redshifts $z < 0.5$. Importantly, this model\nimplies the lobes remain over-pressured with respect to the ambient medium well\nafter their active lifetime, in contrast with existing observational evidence\nthat many FRII radio galaxy lobes reach pressure equilibrium with the external\nmedium whilst still in the active phase. The predicted age distribution of\nremnants is a steeply decreasing function of age. In other words young remnants\nare expected to be much more common than old remnants in flux limited samples.\nFor this reason, incorporating higher frequency data $\\gtrsim 5$ GHz will be of\ngreat benefit to future studies of the remnant population.\n", "  We consider a five dimensional AdS spacetime, in presence of higher curvature\nterm like $F(R) = R + \\alpha R^2$ in the bulk, in the context of\nRandall-Sundrum two-brane model. Our universe is identified with the TeV scale\nbrane and emerges as a four dimensional effective theory. From the perspective\nof this effective theory, we examine the possibility of \"inflationary scenario\"\nby considering the on-brane metric ansatz as an FRW one. Our results reveal\nthat the higher curvature term in the five dimensional bulk spacetime generates\na potential term for the radion field. Due to the presence of radion potential,\nthe very early universe undergoes a stage of accelerated expansion and moreover\nthe accelerating period of the universe terminates in a finite time. We also\nfind the spectral index of curvature perturbation ($n_s$) and tensor to scalar\nratio ($r$) in the present context, which match with the observational results\nbased on the observations of $Planck$ $2015$.\n", "  We present \\ci\\,(2--1) and multi-transition $^{12}$CO observations of a dusty\nstar-forming galaxy, ACT\\,J2029+0120, which we spectroscopically confirm to lie\nat $z$\\,=\\,2.64. We detect CO(3--2), CO(5--4), CO(7--6), CO(8--7), and\n\\ci\\,(2--1) at high significance, tentatively detect HCO$^{+}$(4--3), and place\nstrong upper limits on the integrated strength of dense gas tracers (HCN(4--3)\nand CS(7--6)). Multi-transition CO observations and dense gas tracers can\nprovide valuable constraints on the molecular gas content and excitation\nconditions in high-redshift galaxies. We therefore use this unique data set to\nconstruct a CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) of the source, which is\nmost consistent with that of a ULIRG/Seyfert or QSO host object in the taxonomy\nof the \\textit{Herschel} Comprehensive ULIRG Emission Survey. We employ RADEX\nmodels to fit the peak of the CO SLED, inferring a temperature of T$\\sim$117 K\nand $n_{\\text{H}_2}\\sim10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, most consistent with a ULIRG/QSO object\nand the presence of high density tracers. We also find that the velocity width\nof the \\ci\\ line is potentially larger than seen in all CO transitions for this\nobject, and that the $L'_{\\rm C\\,I(2-1)}/L'_{\\rm CO(3-2)}$ ratio is also larger\nthan seen in other lensed and unlensed submillimeter galaxies and QSO hosts; if\nconfirmed, this anomaly could be an effect of differential lensing of a shocked\nmolecular outflow.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the characteristics and operation of Astro Space\nCenter (ASC) software FX correlator that is an important component of\nspace-ground interferometer for Radioastron project. This project performs\njoint observations of compact radio sources using 10 meter space radio\ntelescope (SRT) together with ground radio telescopes at 92, 18, 6 and 1.3 cm\nwavelengths. In this paper we describe the main features of space-ground VLBI\ndata processing of Radioastron project using ASC correlator. Quality of\nimplemented fringe search procedure provides positive results without\nsignificant losses in correlated amplitude. ASC Correlator has a computational\npower close to real time operation. The correlator has a number of processing\nmodes: \"Continuum\", \"Spectral Line\", \"Pulsars\", \"Giant Pulses\",\"Coherent\".\nSpecial attention is paid to peculiarities of Radioastron space-ground VLBI\ndata processing. The algorithms of time delay and delay rate calculation are\nalso discussed, which is a matter of principle for data correlation of\nspace-ground interferometers. During 5 years of Radioastron space radio\ntelescope (SRT) successful operation, ASC correlator showed high potential of\nsatisfying steady growing needs of current and future ground and space VLBI\nscience. Results of ASC software correlator operation are demonstrated.\n", "  Empirical simulations based on extrapolations from well-established\nlow-frequency ($< 5$ GHz) surveys fail to accurately model the faint, high\nfrequency ($>10$~GHz) source population; they under-predict the number of\nobserved sources by a factor of two below $S_{18~\\rm GHz} = 10$ mJy and fail to\nreproduce the observed spectral index distribution. We suggest that this is\nbecause the faint radio galaxies are not modelled correctly in the simulations\nand show that by adding a flat-spectrum core component to the FRI sources in\nthe SKA Simulated Skies, the observed 15-GHz source counts can be reproduced.\nWe find that the observations are best matched by assuming that the fraction of\nthe total 1.4-GHz flux density which originates from the core varies with\n1.4-GHz luminosity; sources with 1.4-GHz luminosities $< 10^{25} \\rm W \\,\nHz^{-1}$ require a core fraction $\\sim 0.3$, while the more luminous sources\nrequire a much smaller core fraction of $5 \\times 10^{-4}$. The low luminosity\nFRI sources with high core fractions which were not included in the original\nsimulation may be equivalent to the compact `FR0' sources found in recent\nstudies.\n", "  In any Bell test, loopholes can cause issues in the interpretation of the\nresults, since an apparent violation of the inequality may not correspond to a\nviolation of local realism. An important example is the coincidence-time\nloophole that arises when detector settings might influence the time when\ndetection will occur. This effect can be observed in many experiments where\nmeasurement outcomes are to be compared between remote stations because the\ninterpretation of an ostensible Bell violation strongly depends on the method\nused to decide coincidence. The coincidence-time loophole has previously been\nstudied for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) and Clauser-Horne (CH)\ninequalities, but recent experiments have shown the need for a generalization.\nHere, we study the generalized \"chained\" inequality by Pearle-Braunstein-Caves\n(PBC) with two or more settings per observer. This inequality has applications\nin, for instance, Quantum Key Distribution where it has been used to\nre-establish security. In this paper we give the minimum coincidence\nprobability for the PBC inequality for all N and show that this bound is tight\nfor a violation free of the fair-coincidence assumption. Thus, if an experiment\nhas a coincidence probability exceeding the critical value derived here, the\ncoincidence-time loophole is eliminated.\n", "  The optical, full-phase photometric variations of a short-period planet\nprovide a unique view of the planet's atmospheric composition and dynamics. The\nnumber of planets with optical phase curve detections, however, is currently\ntoo small to study them as an aggregate population, motivating an extension of\nthe search to non-transiting planets. Here we present an algorithm for the\ndetection of non-transiting, short-period giant planets in the Kepler field.\nThe procedure uses the phase curves themselves as evidence for the planets'\nexistence. We employ a supervised learning algorithm to recognize the salient\ntime-dependent properties of synthetic phase curves; we then search for\ndetections of signals that match these properties. After demonstrating the\nalgorithm's capabilities, we classify 142,630 FGK Kepler stars without\nconfirmed planets or KOIs and, for each one, assign a probability of a phase\ncurve of a non-transiting planet being present. We identify 60 high-probability\nnon-transiting hot Jupiter candidates. We also derive constraints on the\ncandidates' albedos and offsets of the phase curve maxima. These targets are\nstrong candidates for follow-up radial velocity confirmation and\ncharacterization. Once confirmed, the atmospheric information content in the\nphase curves may be studied in yet greater detail.\n", "  Observations indicate that the dispersal of protoplanetary discs in star\nclusters occurs on time scales of about 5 Myr. Several processes are thought to\nbe responsible for this disc dispersal. Here we compare two of these processes:\ndynamical encounters and interaction with the interstellar medium, which\nincludes face-on accretion and ram pressure stripping. We perform simulations\nof embedded star clusters with parameterisations for both processes to\ndetermine the environment in which either of these processes is dominant. We\nfind that face-on accretion, including ram pressure stripping, is the dominant\ndisc truncation process if the fraction of the total cluster mass in stars is\n$\\lesssim 30\\,\\%$ regardless of the cluster mass and radius. Dynamical\nencounters require stellar densities $\\gtrsim 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$ combined with a\nmass fraction in stars of $\\approx 90\\,\\%$ to become the dominant process. Our\nresults show that during the embedded phase of the cluster, the truncation of\nthe discs is dominated by face-on accretion and dynamical encounters become\ndominant when the intra-cluster gas has been expelled. As a result of face-on\naccretion the protoplanetary discs become compact and their surface density\nincreases. In contrast, dynamical encounters lead to discs that are less\nmassive and remain larger.\n", "  HD189733 is an active K dwarf that is, with its transiting hot Jupiter, among\nthe most studied exoplanetary systems. In this first paper of the\nMultiwavelength Observations of an eVaporating Exoplanet and its Star (MOVES)\nprogram, we present a 2-year monitoring of the large-scale magnetic field of\nHD189733. The magnetic maps are reconstructed for five epochs of observations,\nnamely June-July 2013, August 2013, September 2013, September 2014, and July\n2015, using Zeeman-Doppler Imaging. We show that the field evolves along the\nfive epochs, with mean values of the total magnetic field of 36, 41, 42, 32 and\n37 G, respectively. All epochs show a toroidally-dominated field. Using\npreviously published data of Moutou et al. 2007 and Fares et al. 2010, we are\nable to study the evolution of the magnetic field over 9 years, one of the\nlongest monitoring campaign for a given star. While the field evolved during\nthe observed epochs, no polarity switch of the poles was observed. We calculate\nthe stellar magnetic field value at the position of the planet using the\nPotential Field Source Surface extrapolation technique. We show that the\nplanetary magnetic environment is not homogeneous over the orbit, and that it\nvaries between observing epochs, due to the evolution of the stellar magnetic\nfield. This result underlines the importance of contemporaneous\nmulti-wavelength observations to characterise exoplanetary systems. Our\nreconstructed maps are a crucial input for the interpretation and modelling of\nour MOVES multi-wavelength observations.\n", "  The critical properties of the single-crystalline semiconducting ferromagnet\nCrGeTe$_3$ were investigated by bulk dc magnetization around the paramagnetic\nto ferromagnetic phase transition. Critical exponents $\\beta = 0.200\\pm0.003$\nwith critical temperature $T_c = 62.65\\pm0.07$ K and $\\gamma = 1.28\\pm0.03$\nwith $T_c = 62.75\\pm0.06$ K are obtained by the Kouvel-Fisher method whereas\n$\\delta = 7.96\\pm0.01$ is obtained by the critical isotherm analysis at $T_c =\n62.7$ K. These critical exponents obey the Widom scaling relation $\\delta =\n1+\\gamma/\\beta$, indicating self-consistency of the obtained values. With these\ncritical exponents the isotherm $M(H)$ curves below and above the critical\ntemperatures collapse into two independent universal branches, obeying the\nsingle scaling equation $m = f_\\pm(h)$, where $m$ and $h$ are renormalized\nmagnetization and field, respectively. The determined exponents match well with\nthose calculated from the results of renormalization group approach for a\ntwo-dimensional Ising system coupled with long-range interaction between spins\ndecaying as $J(r)\\approx r^{-(d+\\sigma)}$ with $\\sigma=1.52$.\n", "  We study the role of electron-phonon scattering for a pulse-triggered quantum\ndot single-photon source which utilizes a modified version of stimulated Raman\nadiabatic passage and cavity-coupling. This on-demand source is coherently\npumped with an optical pulse in the presence of a continuous wave laser drive,\nallowing for efficient generation of indistinguishable single photons with\npolarizations orthogonal to the applied fields. In contrast to previous\nstudies, we explore the role of electron-phonon scattering on this\nsemiconductor system by using a polaron master equation approach to model the\nbiexciton-exciton cascade and cavity mode coupling. In addition to background\nzero-phonon-line decoherence processes, electron-acoustic-phonon coupling,\nwhich usually degrades the indistinguishability and efficiency of semiconductor\nphoton sources, is rigorously taken into account. We study how cavity and laser\ndetunings affect the device performance, and explore the effects of finite\ntemperature on pure dephasing and intrinsic phonon-coupling. We describe how\nthis biexciton-exciton cascade scheme allows for true single photons to be\ngenerated with over 90% quantum indistinguishability and efficiency\nsimultaneously using realistic experimental parameters. We also show how the\ndouble-field dressing can be probed through the cavity-emitted spectrum.\n", "  We present deep optical spectroscopy of eight HII regions located in the\nanticentre of the Milky Way. The spectra were obtained at the 10.4m GTC and\n8.2m VLT. We determined Te([NII]) for all objects and Te([OIII]) for six of\nthem. We also included in our analysis an additional sample of 13 inner-disc\nGalactic Hii regions from the literature that have excellent T_e\ndeterminations. We adopted the same methodology and atomic dataset to determine\nthe physical conditions and ionic abundances for both samples. We also detected\nthe CII and OII optical recombination lines in Sh 2-100, which enables\ndetermination of the abundance discrepancy factor for this object. We found\nthat the slopes of the radial oxygen gradients defined by the HII regions from\nR_25 (= 11.5 kpc) to 17 kpc and those within R_25 are similar within the\nuncertainties, indicating the absence of flattening in the radial oxygen\ngradient in the outer Milky Way. In general, we found that the scatter of the\nO/H ratios of Hii regions is not substantially larger than the observational\nuncertainties. The largest possible local inhomogeneities of the oxygen\nabundances are of the order of 0.1 dex. We also found positive radial gradients\nin Te([O III]) and Te([N II]) across the Galactic disc. The shapes of these\ntemperature gradients are similar and also consistent with the absence of\nflattening of the metallicity distribution in the outer Galactic disc.\n", "  The thermal stability of accretion disk and the possibility to see a\nlimit-cycle behaviour strongly depends on the ability of the disk plasma to\ncool down. Various processes connected with radiation-matter interaction\nappearing in hot accretion disk plasma contribute to opacity. For the case of\ngeometrically thin and optically thick accretion disk, we can estimate the\ninfluence of several different components of function \\kappa, given by the\nRoseland mean. In the case of high temperatures, the electron Thomson\nscattering is dominant. At lower temperatures atomic processes become\nimportant. The slope d log \\kappa/d log T can have locally stabilizing or\ndestabilizing effect on the disk. Although the local MHD simulation postulate\nthe stabilizing influence of the atomic processes, only the global\ntime-dependent model can reveal the global disk stability range estimation.\nThis is due to global diffusive nature of that processes. In this paper, using\npreviously tested GLADIS code with modified prescription of the viscous\ndissipation, we examine the stabilizing effect of the Iron Opacity Bump.\n", "  Quantum state transfer from flying photons to stationary matter qubits is an\nimportant element in the realization of quantum networks. Self-assembled\nsemiconductor quantum dots provide a promising solid-state platform hosting\nboth single photon and spin, with an inherent light-matter interface. Here, we\ndevelop a method to coherently and actively control the single-photon frequency\nbins in superposition using electro-optic modulators, and measure the\nspin-photon entanglement with a fidelity of $0.796\\pm0.020$. Further, by\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type state projection on the frequency, path and\npolarization degrees of freedom of a single photon, we demonstrate quantum\nstate transfer from a single photon to a single electron spin confined in an\nInGaAs quantum dot, separated by 5 meters. The quantum state mapping from the\nphoton's polarization to the electron's spin is demonstrated along three\ndifferent axis on the Bloch sphere, with an average fidelity of $78.5\\%$.\n", "  We present our first results of the survey for high redshift quasars at $5\n\\lesssim {\\rm z} \\lesssim 5.7$. The search for quasars in this redshift range\nhas been known to be challenging due to limitations of filter sets used in\nprevious studies. We conducted a quasar survey for two specific redshift\nranges, 4.60 $\\leq$ z $\\leq$ 5.40 and 5.50 $\\leq$ z $\\leq$ 6.05, using\nmulti-wavelength data that include observations using custom-designed filters,\n$is$ and $iz$. Using these filters and a new selection technique, we were able\nto reduce the fraction of interlopers. Through optical spectroscopy, we\nconfirmed seven quasars at 4.7 $\\leq$ z $\\leq$ 5.4 with $-27.4 < M_{1450} <\n-26.4$ which were discovered independently by another group recently. We\nestimated black hole masses and Eddington ratios of four of these quasars from\noptical and near-infrared spectra, and found that these quasars are undergoing\nnearly Eddington-limited accretion which is consistent with the rapid growth of\nsupermassive black holes in luminous quasars at z $\\sim$ 5.\n", "  Sulfur is an abundant element in the cosmos and it is thus an important\ncontributor to astrochemistry in the interstellar medium and in the Solar\nSystem. Astronomical observations of the gas and of the solid phases in the\ndense interstellar/circumstellar regions have evidenced that sulfur is\nunderabundant. The hypothesis to explain such a circumstance is that it is\nincorporated in some species in the solid phase (i.e. as frozen gases and/or\nrefractory solids) and/or in the gas phase, which for different reasons have\nnot been observed so far. Here we wish to give a contribution to the field by\nstudying the chemistry induced by thermal and energetic processing of frozen\nmixtures of sulfur dioxide (one of the most abundant sulfur-bearing molecules\nobserved so far) and water. We present the results of a series of laboratory\nexperiments concerning thermal processing of different H2O:SO2 mixtures and ion\nbombardment 30 keV He$^+$ of the same mixtures. We used in situ FTIR\nspectroscopy to investigate the induced effects. The results indicate that\nionic species such as HSO$_{3}^{-}$, HSO$_{4}^{-}$, and S$_2$O$_{5}^{2-}$ are\neasily produced. Energetic processing also produces SO$_3$ polymers and a\nsulfurous refractory residue. The produced ionic species exhibit spectral\nfeatures in a region that, in astronomical spectra of dense molecular clouds,\nis dominated by strong silicate absorption. However, such a dominant feature is\nassociated with some spectral features, some of which have not yet been\nidentified. We suggest adding the sulfur-bearing ionic species to the list of\ncandidates to help explain some of those features.\n", "  Stars with convective envelopes display magnetic activity, which decreases\nover time due to the magnetic braking of the star. This age-dependence of\nmagnetic activity is well-studied for younger stars, but the nature of this\ndependence for older stars is not well understood. This is mainly because\nabsolute stellar ages for older stars are hard to measure. However, relatively\naccurate stellar ages have recently come into reach through asteroseismology.\nIn this work we present X-ray luminosities, which are a measure for magnetic\nactivity displayed by the stellar coronae, for 24 stars with well-determined\nages older than a gigayear. We find 14 stars with detectable X-ray luminosities\nand use these to calibrate the age-activity relationship. We find a\nrelationship between stellar X-ray luminosity, normalized by stellar surface\narea, and age that is steeper than the relationships found for younger stars,\nwith an exponent of $-2.80 \\pm 0.72$. Previous studies have found values for\nthe exponent of the age-activity relationship ranging between -1.09 to -1.40,\ndependent on spectral type, for younger stars. Given that there are recent\nreports of a flattening relationship between age and rotational period for old\ncool stars, one possible explanation is that we witness a strong steepening of\nthe relationship between activity and rotation.\n", "  We present very early, high-cadence photometric observations of the nearby\nType Ia SN 2017cbv. The light curve is unique in that it has a blue bump during\nthe first five days of observations in the U, B, and g bands, which is clearly\nresolved given our photometric cadence of 5.7 hr during that time span. We\nmodel the light curve as the combination of early shocking of the supernova\nejecta against a nondegenerate companion star plus a standard SN Ia component.\nOur best-fit model suggests the presence of a subgiant star 56 solar radii from\nthe exploding white dwarf, although this number is highly model-dependent.\nWhile this model matches the optical light curve well, it overpredicts the\nobserved flux in the ultraviolet bands. This may indicate that the shock is not\na blackbody, perhaps because of line blanketing in the UV. Alternatively, it\ncould point to another physical explanation for the optical blue bump, such as\ninteraction with circumstellar material or an unusual nickel distribution.\nEarly optical spectra of SN 2017cbv show strong carbon absorption up through\nday -13 with respect to maximum light, suggesting that the progenitor system\ncontains a significant amount of unburned material. These early results on SN\n2017cbv illustrate the power of early discovery and intense follow-up of nearby\nsupernovae to resolve standing questions about the progenitor systems and\nexplosion mechanisms of SNe Ia.\n", "  We consider a model with two real scalar fields which admits phantom domain\nwall solutions. We investigate the structure and evolution of these phantom\ndomain walls in an expanding homogeneous and isotropic universe. In particular,\nwe show that the increase of the tension of the domain walls with cosmic time,\nassociated to the evolution of the phantom scalar field, is responsible for an\nadditional damping term in their equations of motion. We describe the\nmacroscopic dynamics of phantom domain walls, showing that extended phantom\ndefects whose tension varies on a cosmological timescale cannot be the dark\nenergy.\n", "  49 Cam is a cool magnetic chemically peculiar star which has been noted for\nshowing strong, complex Zeeman linear polarisation signatures. This paper\ndescribes magnetic and chemical surface maps obtained for 49 Cam using the\nINVERS10 magnetic Doppler imaging code and high-resolution spectropolarimetric\ndata in all four Stokes parameters collected with the ESPaDOnS and Narval\nspectropolarimeters at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and Pic du Midi\nObservatory. The reconstructed magnetic field maps of 49 Cam show a relatively\ncomplex structure. Describing the magnetic field topology in terms of spherical\nharmonics, we find significant contributions of modes up to l=3, including\ntoroidal components. Observations cannot be reproduced using a simple low-order\nmultipolar magnetic field structure. 49 Cam exhibits a level of field\ncomplexity that has not been seen in magnetic maps of other cool Ap stars.\nHence we concluded that relatively complex magnetic fields are observed in Ap\nstars at both low and high effective temperatures. In addition to mapping the\nmagnetic field, we also derive surface abundance distributions of nine chemical\nelements, including Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu. Comparing these\nabundance maps with the reconstructed magnetic field geometry, we find no clear\nrelationship of the abundance distributions with the magnetic field for some\nelements. However, for other elements some distinct patterns are found. We\ndiscuss these results in the context of other recent magnetic mapping studies\nand theoretical predictions of radiative diffusion.\n", "  Reverberation observations have uncovered an Fe K{\\alpha} fluorescence line\nin the tidal disruption event (TDE) Swift J1644+57 (Kara et al. 2016). The\ndiscovery paper used the lag spectrum to argue that the X-ray continuum source\nwas located very close to the blackhole (~30 gravitational radii) and moved\nsub-relativistically. We reanalyze the lag spectrum, pointing out that dilution\neffects cause it to indicate a geometric scale an order of magnitude larger\nthan previously inferred. If the X-ray continuum is produced by a relativistic\njet, as suggested by rapid variability, high luminosity and hard spectrum, this\nlarger scale predicts an Fe ionization state consistent with efficient\nK{\\alpha} production. Moreover, the momentum of the jet radiation impinging on\nthe surrounding accretion flow on this larger scale accelerates a layer of gas\nto speeds ~0.1-0.2c, consistent with the blueshifted line profile.\n  Implications of our results on the global picture of jetted TDEs are\ndiscussed. A power-law {\\gamma}/X-ray spectrum may be produced by external\nUV-optical photons being repetitively inverse-Compton scattered by cold\nelectrons in the jet, although our model for the K{\\alpha} reverberation does\nnot depend on the jet radiation mechanism (magnetic reconnection in a Poynting\njet is still a viable mechanism). The non-relativistic wind driven by jet\nradiation may explain the late-time radio rebrightening in Swift J1644+57. This\nenergy injection may also cause the thermal UV-optical emission from jetted\nTDEs to be systematically brighter than in non-jetted ones.\n", "  We used a dataset of archival Hubble Space Telescope images obtained through\nthe F555W, F814W and F656N filters, to perform a complete search for objects\nshowing $H\\alpha$ emission in the globular cluster NGC 6397. As photometric\ndiagnostic, we used the $(V-H\\alpha)_0$ color excess in the\n$(V-H\\alpha)_0$-$(V-I)_0$ color-color diagram. In the analysed field of view,\nwe identified 53 $H\\alpha$ emitters. In particular, we confirmed the optical\ncounterpart to 20 X-ray sources (7 cataclysmic variables, 2 millisecond pulsars\nand 11 active binaries) and identified 33 previously unknown sources, thus\nsignificantly enlarging the population of known active binaries in this\ncluster. We report the main characteristics for each class of objects.\nPhotometric estimates of the equivalent width of the $H\\alpha$ emission line,\nwere derived from the $(V-H\\alpha)_0$-excess and, for the first time, compared\nto the spectroscopic measurements obtained from the analysis of MUSE spectra.\nThe very good agreement between the spectroscopic and photometric measures\nfully confirmed the reliability of the proposed approach to measure the\n$H\\alpha$ emission. The search demonstrated the efficiency of this novel\napproach to pinpoint and measure $H\\alpha$-emitters, thus offering a powerful\ntool to conduct complete census of objects whose formation and evolution can be\nstrongly affected by dynamical interactions in star clusters.\n", "  The heliosphere is formed due to interaction between the solar wind (SW) and\nlocal interstellar medium (LISM). The shape and position of the heliospheric\nboundary, the heliopause, in space depend on the parameters of interacting\nplasma flows. The interplay between the asymmetrizing effect of the\ninterstellar magnetic field and charge exchange between ions and neutral atoms\nplays an important role in the SW-LISM interaction. By performing\nthree-dimensional, MHD plasma / kinetic neutral atom simulations, we determine\nthe width of the outer heliosheath - the LISM plasma region affected by the\npresence of the heliosphere - and analyze quantitatively the distributions in\nfront of the heliopause. It is shown that charge exchange modifies the LISM\nplasma to such extent that the contribution of a shock transition to the total\nvariation of plasma parameters becomes small even if the LISM velocity exceeds\nthe fast magnetosonic speed in the unperturbed medium. By performing adaptive\nmesh refinement simulations, we show that a distinct boundary layer of\ndecreased plasma density and enhanced magnetic field should be observed on the\ninterstellar side of the heliopause. We show that this behavior is in agreement\nwith the plasma oscillations of increasing frequency observed by the plasma\nwave instrument onboard Voyager 1. We also demonstrate that Voyager\nobservations in the inner heliosheath between the heliospheric termination\nshock and the heliopause are consistent with dissipation of the heliospheric\nmagnetic field. The choice of LISM parameters in this analysis is based on the\nsimulations that fit observations of energetic neutral atoms performed by IBEX.\n", "  Galactic globular clusters (GCs) are believed to have formed in-situ in the\nGalaxy as well as in dwarf galaxies later accreted onto the Milky Way. However,\nto date, there is no unambiguous signature to distinguish accreted GCs. Using\nspecifically designed $N$-body simulations of GCs evolving in a variety of\ntime-dependent tidal fields (describing the potential of a dwarf galaxy-Milky\nWay merger), we analyze the effects imprinted to the internal kinematics of an\naccreted GC. In particular, we look at the evolution of the velocity\nanisotropy. Our simulations show that at early phases, the velocity anisotropy\nis determined by the tidal field of the dwarf galaxy and subsequently the\nclusters will adapt to the new tidal environment, losing any signature of their\noriginal environment in a few relaxation times. At 10 Gyr, GCs exhibit a\nvariety of velocity anisotropy profiles, namely, isotropic velocity\ndistribution in the inner regions and either isotropy or radial/tangential\nanisotropy in the intermediate and outer regions. Independently of an accreted\norigin, the velocity anisotropy primarily depends on the strength of the tidal\nfield cumulatively experienced by a cluster. Tangentially anisotropic clusters\ncorrespond to systems that have experienced stronger tidal fields and are\ncharacterized by higher tidal filling factor, $r_{50}/r_j\\gtrsim0.17$, higher\nmass loss $\\gtrsim60\\%$ and relaxation times $t_{rel}\\lesssim10^9$ Gyr.\nInterestingly, we demonstrate that the presence of tidal tails can\nsignificantly contaminate the measurements of velocity anisotropy when a\ncluster is observed in projection. Our characterization of the velocity\nanisotropy profiles in different tidal environments provides a theoretical\nbenchmark for the interpretation of the unprecedented amount of\nthree-dimensional kinematic data progressively available for Galactic GCs.\n", "  Scientific discovery via numerical simulations is important in modern\nastrophysics. This relatively new branch of astrophysics has become possible\ndue to the development of reliable numerical algorithms and the high\nperformance of modern computing technologies. These enable the analysis of\nlarge collections of observational data and the acquisition of new data via\nsimulations at unprecedented accuracy and resolution. Ideally, simulations run\nuntil they reach some pre-determined termination condition, but often other\nfactors cause extensive numerical approaches to break down at an earlier stage.\nIn those cases, processes tend to be interrupted due to unexpected events in\nthe software or the hardware. In those cases, the scientist handles the\ninterrupt manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. We present the\nSimulation Monitor (SiMon) to automatize the farming of large and extensive\nsimulation processes. Our method is light-weight, it fully automates the entire\nworkflow management, operates concurrently across multiple platforms and can be\ninstalled in user space. Inspired by the process of crop farming, we perceive\neach simulation as a crop in the field and running simulation becomes analogous\nto growing crops. With the development of SiMon we relax the technical aspects\nof simulation management. The initial package was developed for extensive\nparameter searchers in numerical simulations, but it turns out to work equally\nwell for automating the computational processing and reduction of observational\ndata reduction.\n", "  Previous studies have shown that CIZA J2242.8+5301 (the 'Sausage' cluster,\n$z=0.192$) is a massive merging galaxy cluster that hosts a radio halo and\nmultiple relics. In this paper we present deep, high fidelity, low-frequency\nimages made with the LOw-Frequency Array (LOFAR) between 115.5 and 179 MHz.\nThese images, with a noise of 140 mJy/beam and a resolution of\n$\\theta_{\\text{beam}}=7.3\"\\times5.3\"$, are an order of magnitude more sensitive\nand five times higher resolution than previous low-frequency images of this\ncluster. We combined the LOFAR data with the existing GMRT (153, 323, 608 MHz)\nand WSRT (1.2, 1.4, 1.7, 2.3 GHz) data to study the spectral properties of the\nradio emission from the cluster. Assuming diffusive shock acceleration (DSA),\nwe found Mach numbers of $\\mathcal{M}_{n}=2.7{}_{-0.3}^{+0.6}$ and\n$\\mathcal{M}_{s}=1.9_{-0.2}^{+0.3}$ for the northern and southern shocks. The\nderived Mach number for the northern shock requires an acceleration efficiency\nof several percent to accelerate electrons from the thermal pool, which is\nchallenging for DSA. Using the radio data, we characterised the eastern relic\nas a shock wave propagating outwards with a Mach number of\n$\\mathcal{M}_{e}=2.4_{-0.3}^{+0.5}$, which is in agreement with\n$\\mathcal{M}_{e}^{X}=2.5{}_{-0.2}^{+0.6}$ that we derived from Suzaku data. The\neastern shock is likely to be associated with the major cluster merger. The\nradio halo was measured with a flux of $346\\pm64\\,\\text{mJy}$ at\n$145\\,\\text{MHz}$. Across the halo, we observed a spectral index that remains\napproximately constant ($\\alpha^{\\text{145 MHz-2.3 GHz}}_{\\text{across\n\\(\\sim\\)1 Mpc}^2}=-1.01\\pm0.10$) after the steepening in the post-shock region\nof the northern relic. This suggests a generation of post-shock turbulence that\nre-energies aged electrons.\n", "  The measurement of neutron star mass and radius is one of the most direct way\nto distinguish between various dense matter equations of state. The mass and\nradius of accreting neutron stars hosted in low mass X-ray binaries can be\nconstrained by several methods, including photospheric radius expansion from\ntype-I X-ray bursts and from quiescent spectra. In this paper, we apply for the\nfirst time these two methods simultaneously to constrain the mass and radius of\nAql X-1, as a reliable distance estimation, high signal-to-noise ratio\nquiescent spectra from Chandra and XMM-Newton, and photospheric radius\nexpansion bursts from RXTE are available. This is also used to verify the\nconsistency between the two methods, and to narrow down the uncertainties of\nthe neutron star mass and radius. It is found that the distance to Aql X-1\nshould be in the range of $4.0-5.75$ kpc, based on the overlapping confidence\nregions between photospheric radius expansion burst and quiescent spectra\nmethods. In addition, we show that the mass and radius determined for the\ncompact star in Aql X-1 are compatible with strange star equations of state and\nconventional neutron star models.\n", "  We propose a reconnection-condensation model in which topological change in a\ncoronal magnetic field via reconnection triggers radiative condensation,\nthereby resulting in prominence formation. Previous observational studies have\nsuggested that reconnection at a polarity inversion line of a coronal arcade\nfield creates a flux rope that can sustain a prominence; however, they did not\nexplain the origin of cool dense plasmas of prominences. Using\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations including anisotropic\nnonlinear thermal conduction and optically thin radiative cooling, we\ndemonstrate that reconnection can lead not only to flux rope formation but also\nto radiative condensation under a certain condition. In our model, this\ncondition is described by the Field length, which is defined as the scale\nlength for thermal balance between radiative cooling and thermal conduction.\nThis critical condition depends weakly on the artificial background heating.\nThe extreme ultraviolet emissions synthesized with our simulation results have\ngood agreement with observational signatures reported in previous studies.\n", "  We present a sophisticated statistical point-source foreground model for\nlow-frequency radio Epoch of Reionization (EoR) experiments using the 21 cm\nneutral hydrogen emission line. Motivated by our understanding of the\nlow-frequency radio sky, we enhance the realism of two model components\ncompared with existing models: the source count distributions as a function of\nflux density and spatial position (source clustering), extending current\nformalisms for the foreground covariance of 2D power spectral modes in 21 cm\nEoR experiments. The former we generalise to an arbitrarily broken power-law,\nand the latter to an arbitrary isotropically-correlated field. This paper\npresents expressions for the modified covariance under these extensions, and\nshows that for a more realistic source spatial distribution, extra covariance\narises in the EoR window which was previously unaccounted for. Failure to\ninclude this contribution can yield bias in the final power spectrum and\nunder-estimate uncertainties, potentially leading to a false detection of\nsignal. The extent of this effect is uncertain, owing to ignorance of physical\nmodel parameters, but we show that it is dependent on the relative abundance of\nfaint sources, to the effect that our extension will become more important for\nfuture deep surveys. Finally, we show that under some parameter choices,\nignoring source clustering can lead to false detections on large scales, due to\nboth the induced bias and an artificial reduction in the estimated measurement\nuncertainty.\n", "  Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most powerful\nexplosions in the Sun. They are major sources of potentially destructive space\nweather conditions. However, the possible causes of their initiation remain\ncontroversial. By using high resolution data observed by NST of BBSO,\nsupplemented by Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) observations, we present\nunusual observations of a small-scale emerging flux rope near a large sunspot,\nwhose eruption produced an M-class flare and a coronal mass ejection. The\npresence of the small-scale flux rope was indicated by static nonlinear force\nfree field (NLFFF) extrapolation as well as data-driven MHD modeling of the\ndynamic evolution of the coronal 3D magnetic field. During the emergence of the\nflux rope, rotation of satellite sunspots at the footpoints of the flux rope\nwas observed. Meanwhile, the Lorentz force, magnetic energy, vertical current,\nand transverse fields were increasing during this phase. The free energy from\nthe magnetic flux emergence and twisting magnetic fields is sufficient to power\nthe M-class flare. These observations for the first time present the complete\nprocess from the emergence of the small-scale flux rope to the production of\nsolar eruptions.\n", "  Using multi-wavelength data, from UV-optical-near-mid IR, for $\\sim$6000\ngalaxies in the local Universe, we study the dependence of star formation on\nthe morphological T-types for massive galaxies ($\\log M_*/M_\\odot \\geq 10$). We\nfind that, early-type spirals (Sa-Sbc) and S0s predominate in the green valley,\nwhich is a transition zone between the star forming and quenched regions.\nWithin the early-type spirals, as we move from Sa to Sbc spirals the fraction\nof green valley and quenched galaxies decreases, indicating the important role\nof the bulge in the quenching of galaxies. The fraction of early-type spirals\ndecreases as we enter the green valley from the blue cloud, which coincides\nwith the increase in the fraction of S0s. This points towards the morphological\ntransformation of early-type spiral galaxies into S0s which can happen due to\nenvironmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping, galaxy harassment, or\ntidal interactions. We also find a second population of S0s which are actively\nstar-forming and are present in all environments. Since morphological T-type,\nspecific star formation rate (sSFR), and environmental density are all\ncorrelated with each other, we compute the partial correlation coefficient for\neach pair of parameters while keeping the third parameter as a control\nvariable. We find that morphology most strongly correlates with sSFR,\nindependent of the environment, while the other two correlations\n(morphology-density and sSFR-environment) are weaker. Thus, we conclude that,\nfor massive galaxies in the local Universe, the physical processes that shape\ntheir morphology are also the ones that determine their star-forming state.\n", "  We present a method for measuring the Sun's motion using the proper motions\nof Galactic halo star streams. The method relies on the fact that the motion of\nthe stars perpendicular to a stream from a low-mass progenitor is close to zero\nwhen viewed from a non-rotating frame at rest with respect to the Galaxy, and\nthat the deviation from zero is due to the reflex motion of the observer. The\nprocedure we implement here has the advantage of being independent of the\nGalactic mass distribution. We run a suite of simulations to test the algorithm\nwe have developed, and find that we can recover the input Solar motion to good\naccuracy with data of the quality that will soon become available from the\nESA/Gaia mission.\n", "  Optical constants of non-stoichiometric amorphous magnesium-iron silicates\nare determined. It is demonstrated that these can well reproduce the observed\nmid-infrared emission spectra of evolved stars. Stoichiometric and\nnon-stoichiometric amorphous magnesium-iron silicate films are fabricated by\npulsed laser deposition. Transmittance and ellipsometry measurements are\nperformed in the wavelength range between 2 and 200 $\\mu$m and 1.7 and 33\n$\\mu$m, respectively. Optical constants are derived from transmittance and\nellipsometric $\\Psi$ and $\\Delta$ spectra by means of oscillator models. The\noptical constants are applied in radiative transfer models for examining\nreproducibility of the observed spectral features of circumstellar dust shells\naround supergiants. The spectra of four selected supergiants are dominated by\namorphous silicate dust emission in the wavelength range of 9 and 25 $\\mu$m. To\nobtain a good fit to the observed spectra, we take into account amorphous\ncorundum and metallic iron particles as additional dust components to account\nfor dust emission at $\\lambda<8 \\mu$m and in between the two silicate features.\nFor each of the objects, a set of model parameters (dust mass, condensation\ntemperature) is derived by an automated optimization procedure which well\nreproduces the observation. Consequently, our model spectra using the new\noptical data find that the silicate bands at $\\approx 10$ and $\\approx 18 \\mu$m\ndepend on the magnesium and iron ratio in the silicate system, and that a good\nfit requires a significant iron content of the amorphous silicate dust\ncomponent to reproduce the observed peak positions and shape of the silicate\nbands.\n", "  Observations of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) fluorescence are a potentially\nuseful tool for measuring the H$_2$ abundance in exoplanet atmospheres. This\nemission was previously observed in M$\\;$dwarfs with planetary systems.\nHowever, low signal-to-noise prevented a conclusive determination of its\norigin. Possible sources include exoplanetary atmospheres, circumstellar gas\ndisks, and the stellar surface. We use observations from the \"Measurements of\nthe Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanet Host Stars\"\n(MUSCLES) Treasury Survey to study H$_2$ fluorescence in M$\\;$dwarfs. We detect\nfluorescence in Hubble Space Telescope spectra of 8/9 planet-hosting and 5/6\nnon-planet-hosting M$\\;$dwarfs. The detection statistics, velocity centroids,\nand line widths of the emission suggest a stellar origin. We calculate\nH$_2$-to-stellar-ion flux ratios to compare flux levels between stars. For\nstars with planets, we find an average ratio of 1.7$\\,\\pm\\,$0.9 using the\nfluxes of the brightest H$_2$ feature and two stellar C IV lines. This is\ncompared to 0.9$\\,\\pm\\,$0.4 for stars without planets, showing that the\nplanet-hosting M$\\;$dwarfs do not have significant excess H$_{2}$ emission.\nThis claim is supported by the direct FUV imaging of GJ 832, where no\nfluorescence is observed at the expected star-planet separation. Additionally,\nthe 3-$\\sigma$ upper limit of 4.9$\\,\\times\\,$10$^{-17}$\nerg$\\;$cm$^{-2}\\;$s$^{-1}$ from these observations is two orders of magnitude\nbelow the spectroscopically-observed H$_2$ flux. We constrain the location of\nthe fluorescing H$_2$ using 1D radiative transfer models and find that it could\nreside in starspots or a $\\sim$2500-3000$\\;$K region in the lower chromosphere.\nThe presence of this emission could complicate efforts to quantify the\natmospheric abundance of H$_2$ in exoplanets orbiting M$\\;$dwarfs.\n", "  We report the detection of the 1.3 mm continuum and the molecular emission of\nthe disks of the young triple system SR24 by analyzing ALMA (The Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimter Array) subarcsecond archival observations. We estimate\nthe mass of the disks (0.025 solar masses and 4E-5 earth masses for SR24S and\nSR24N, respectively) and the dynamical mass of the protostars (1.5 and 1.1\nsolar masses). A kinematic model of the SR24S disk to fit its C18O (2-1)\nemission allows us to develop an observational method to learn what is the tilt\nof a rotating and accreting disk. We derive the size, the inclination, the\nposition angle and the sense of rotation of each disk, finding that they are\nstrongly misaligned (108 degrees) and possibly rotate in opposite directions as\nseen from Earth, in projection. We compare the ALMA observations with 12CO SMA\narchival observations, which are more sensitive to extended structures. We find\nthree extended structures and estimate their masses: a molecular bridge joining\nthe disks of the system, a molecular gas reservoir associated with SR24N and a\ngas streamer associated with SR24S. Finally we discuss on the possible origin\nof the misaligned SR24 system, pointing out that a closer inspection of the\nnorthern gas reservoir is needed to better understand it.\n", "  We report a combination of X-ray and neutron diffraction studies, Mossbauer\nspectroscopy and muon spin relaxation (muSR) measurements to probe the\nstructure and magnetic properties of the semiconducting beta-Ce2O2FeSe2\noxychalcogenide. We report a new structural description in space group Pna21\nwhich is consistent with diffraction data and second harmonic generation\nmeasurements and reveal an order-disorder transition on one Fe site at TOD ~\n330 K. Susceptibility measurements, Mossbauer and muSR reveal antiferromagnetic\nordering below TN = 86 K and more complex short range order above this\ntemperature. 12 K neutron diffraction data reveal a modulated magnetic\nstructure with q = 0.444 bN*.\n", "  We have investigated the long-term evolutions of the high-magnetic field\nradio pulsars (HBRPs) with measured braking indices in the same model that was\napplied earlier to individual anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), soft gamma\nrepeaters (SGRs) and dim isolated neutron stars (XDINs). We have shown that the\nrotational properties (period, period derivative and braking index) and the\nX-ray luminosity of individual HBRPs can be acquired simultaneously by the\nneutron stars evolving with fallback discs. The model sources reach the\nobserved properties of HBRPs in the propeller phases, when pulsed radio\nemission is allowed, at ages consistent with the estimated ages of the\nsupernova remnants of the sources. Our results indicate that the strength of\nmagnetic dipole fields of HBRPs are comparable to and even greater than those\nof AXP/SGRs and XDINs, but still one or two orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe values inferred from the magnetic dipole torque formula. The possible\nevolutionary paths of the sources imply that they will lose their seemingly\nHBRP property after about a few 10^4 yr, because either their rapidly\ndecreasing period derivatives will lead them into the normal radio pulsar\npopulation, or they will evolve into the accretion phase switching off the\nradio pulses.\n", "  We employ a set of recent, theoretically motivated, fits to non-perturbative\nunquenched gluon propagators to check in how far double gluon exchange can be\nused to describe the soft sector of pp scattering data (total and differential\ncross section). In particular, we use the refined Gribov--Zwanziger gluon\npropagator (as arising from dealing with the Gribov gauge fixing ambiguity) and\nthe massive Cornwall-type gluon propagator (as motivated from Dyson-Schwinger\nequations) in conjunction with a perturbative quark-gluon vertex, next to a\nmodel based on the non-perturbative quark-gluon Maris-Tandy vertex, popular\nfrom Bethe-Salpeter descriptions of hadronic bound states. We compare the cross\nsections arising from these models with \"older\" ISR and more recent TOTEM and\nATLAS data. The lower the value of total energy \\sqrt{s}, the better the\nresults appear to be.\n", "  Barnett relaxation, first described by Purcell in 1979, appears to play a\nmajor role in the alignment of grains with the interstellar magnetic field. In\n1999, Lazarian and Draine proposed that Barnett relaxation and its relative,\nnuclear relaxation, can induce grains to flip. If this thermal flipping is\nrapid, then the dynamical effect of torques that are fixed relative to the\ngrain body can be greatly reduced. To date, detailed studies of Barnett\nrelaxation have been confined to grains exhibiting dynamic symmetry. In 2003,\nWeingartner argued that internal relaxation cannot induce flips in any grains,\nwhether they exhibit dynamic symmetry or not. In this work, we develop\napproximate expressions for the dissipation rate and diffusion coefficient for\nBarnett relaxation. We revisit the issue of internally induced thermal\nflipping, finding that it cannot occur for grains with dynamic symmetry but\ndoes occur for grains lacking dynamic symmetry.\n", "  Type I X-ray bursts in a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) are caused by unstable\nnuclear burning of accreted materials. Semi-analytical and numerical studies of\nunstable nuclear burning have successfully reproduced partial properties of\nthis kind of burst. However, some other properties (e.g. the waiting time) are\nnot well explained. In this paper, we find that the probability distributions\nof fluence, peak count, rise time, duration and waiting time can be described\nas power-law-like distributions. This indicates that type I X-ray bursts may be\ngoverned by a self-organized criticality (SOC) process. The power-law index of\nwaiting time distribution (WTD) is around $-1$, which is not predicted by any\ncurrent waiting time model. We propose a physical burst rate model, in which\nthe mean occurrence rate is inversely proportional to time $\\lambda\\propto\nt^{-1}$. In this case, the WTD is well explained by a non-stationary Poisson\nprocess within the SOC theory. In this theory, the burst size is also predicted\nto follow a power-law distribution, which requires that the emission area\npossesses only part of the neutron star surface. Furthermore, we find that the\nWTDs of some astrophysical phenomena can also be described by similar\noccurrence rate models.\n", "  We simulated the signal due to neutral He atoms, observed by Interstellar\nBoundary Explorer (IBEX), assuming that charge exchange collisions between\nneutral He atoms and He+ ions operate everywhere between the heliopause and a\ndistant source region in the local interstellar cloud, where the neutral and\ncharged components are in thermal equilibrium. We simulated several test cases\nof the plasma flow within the outer heliosheath and investigated the signal\ngeneration for plasma flows both in the absence and in the presence of the\ninterstellar magnetic field. We found that a signal in the portion of IBEX data\nidentified as due to the Warm Breeze does not arise when a homogeneous plasma\nflow in front of the heliopause is assumed, but it appears immediately when any\nreasonable disturbance in its flow due to the presence of the heliosphere is\nassumed. We obtained a good qualitative agreement between the data selected for\ncomparison and the simulations for a model flow with the velocity vector of the\nunperturbed gas and the direction and intensity of magnetic field adopted from\nrecent determinations. We conclude that direct-sampling observations of neutral\nHe atoms at 1~AU from the Sun are a sensitive tool for investigating the flow\nof interstellar matter in the outer heliosheath, that the Warm Breeze is indeed\nthe secondary population of interstellar helium, as it was hypothesized\nearlier, and that the WB signal is consistent with the heliosphere distorted\nfrom axial symmetry by the interstellar magnetic field.\n", "  Over a dozen ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), low-mass objects of spectral types\n$\\geq$M7, are known to be sources of radio flares. These typically\nseveral-minutes-long radio bursts can be up to 100\\% circularly polarized and\nhave high brightness temperatures, consistent with coherent emission via the\nelectron cyclotron maser operating in $\\sim$kG magnetic fields. Recently, the\nstatistical properties of the bulk physical parameters that describe these UCDs\nhave become adequately described to permit synthesis of the population of\nradio-flaring objects. For the first time, I construct a Monte Carlo simulator\nto model the population of these radio-flaring UCDs. This simulator is powered\nby Intel Secure Key (ISK)- a new processor technology that uses a local entropy\nsource to improve random number generation that has heretofore been used to\nimprove cryptography. The results from this simulator indicate that only\n$\\sim$5% of radio-flaring UCDs within the local interstellar neighborhood\n($<$25 pc away) have been discovered. I discuss a number of scenarios which may\nexplain this radio-flaring fraction, and suggest that the observed behavior is\nlikely a result of several factors. The performance of ISK as compared to other\npseudorandom number generators is also evaluated, and its potential utility for\nother astrophysical codes briefly described.\n", "  We investigate the dynamical evolution of isolated equal-mass star cluster\nmodels by means of direct N-body simulations, primarily focusing on the effects\nof the presence of primordial anisotropy in the velocity space. We found\nevidence of the existence of a monotonic relationship between the moment of\ncore collapse and the amount and flavour of anisotropy in the stellar system.\nSpecifically, equilibria characterised by the same initial structural\nproperties (Plummer density profile) and with different degrees of\ntangentially-biased (radially-biased) anisotropy, reach core collapse earlier\n(later) than isotropic models. We interpret this result in light of an\naccelerated (delayed) phase of the early evolution of collisional stellar\nsystems \"anisotropic-response\"), which we have characterised both in terms of\nthe evolution of the velocity moments and of a fluid model of two-body\nrelaxation. For the case of the most tangentially anisotropic model the initial\nphase of evolution involves a catastrophic collapse of the inner part of the\nsystem which continues until an isotropic velocity distribution is reached.\nThis study represents a first step towards a comprehensive investigation of the\nrole played by kinematic richness in the long-term dynamical evolution of\ncollisional systems.\n", "  We describe the sample design for the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey and present the\nfinal properties of the main samples along with important considerations for\nusing these samples for science. Our target selection criteria were developed\nwhile simultaneously optimizing the size distribution of the MaNGA integral\nfield units (IFUs), the IFU allocation strategy, and the target density to\nproduce a survey defined in terms of maximizing S/N, spatial resolution, and\nsample size. Our selection strategy makes use of redshift limits that only\ndepend on i-band absolute magnitude ($M_i$), or, for a small subset of our\nsample, $M_i$ and color (NUV-i). Such a strategy ensures that all galaxies span\nthe same range in angular size irrespective of luminosity and are therefore\ncovered evenly by the adopted range of IFU sizes. We define three samples: the\nPrimary and Secondary samples are selected to have a flat number density with\nrespect to $M_i$ and are targeted to have spectroscopic coverage to 1.5 and 2.5\neffective radii (Re), respectively. The Color-Enhanced supplement increases the\nnumber of galaxies in the low-density regions of color-magnitude space by\nextending the redshift limits of the Primary sample in the appropriate color\nbins. The samples cover the stellar mass range $5\\times10^8 \\leq M_* \\leq\n3\\times10^{11} M_{\\odot}$ and are sampled at median physical resolutions of\n1.37 kpc and 2.5 kpc for the Primary and Secondary samples respectively. We\nprovide weights that will statistically correct for our luminosity and\ncolor-dependent selection function and IFU allocation strategy, thus correcting\nthe observed sample to a volume limited sample.\n", "  Context. Observations have shown that twisted magnetic fields naturally\noccur, and indeed are omnipresent in the Sun's atmosphere. It is therefore of\ngreat theoretical interest in solar atmospheric waves research to investigate\nthe types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes that can propagate along\ntwisted magnetic flux tubes. Aims. Within the framework of ideal MHD, the main\naim of this work is to investigate small amplitude incompressible wave modes of\ntwisted magnetic flux tubes with m more or equal 1. The axial magnetic field\nstrength inside and outside the tube will be allowed to vary, to ensure the\nresults will not be restricted to only cold plasma equilibria conditions.\nMethods. The dispersion equation for these incompressible linear MHD wave modes\nwas derived analytically by implementing the long wavelength approximation.\nResults. It is shown, in the long wavelength limit, that both the frequency and\nradial velocity profile of the m = 1 kink mode are completely unaffected by the\nchoice of internal background magnetic twist. However, fluting modes with m\nmore or equal 2 are sensitive to the particular radial profile of magnetic\ntwist chosen. Furthermore, due to background twist, a low frequency cut-off is\nintroduced for fluting modes that is not present for kink modes. From an\nobservational point of view, although magnetic twist does not affect the\npropagation of long wavelength kink modes, for fluting modes it will either\nwork for or against the propagation, depending on the direction of wave travel\nrelative to the sign of the background twist.\n", "  The physical mechanisms that bring about the propulsion of a rotating helix\nin a granular medium are considered. A propulsive motion along the axis of the\nrotating helix is induced by both symmetry breaking due to the helical shape,\nand the anisotropic frictional forces undergone by all segments of the helix in\nthe medium. Helix dynamics is studied as a function of helix rotation speed and\nits geometrical parameters. The effect of the granular pressure and the applied\nexternal load were also investigated. A theoretical model is developed based on\nthe anisotropic frictional force experienced by a slender body moving in a\ngranular material, to account for the translation speed of the helix. A good\nagreement with experimental data is obtained, which allows for predicting the\nhelix design to propel optimally within granular media. These results pave the\nway for the development of an efficient sand-robot operating according to this\nmode of locomotion.\n", "  We report on the first multi-color precision light curve of the bright\nWolf-Rayet binary $\\gamma^2$ Velorum, obtained over six months with the\nnanosatellites in the BRITE- Constellation fleet. In parallel, we obtained 488\nhigh-resolution optical spectra of the system. In this first report on the\ndatasets, we revise the spectroscopic orbit and report on the bulk properties\nof the colliding winds. We find a dependence of both the light curve and excess\nemission properties that scales with the inverse of the binary separation. When\nanalyzing the spectroscopic properties in combination with the photometry, we\nfind that the phase dependence is caused only by excess emission in the lines,\nand not from a changing continuum. We also detect a narrow, high-velocity\nabsorption component from the He I $\\lambda$5876 transition, which appears\ntwice in the orbit. We calculate smoothed-particle hydrodynamical simulations\nof the colliding winds and can accurately associate the absorption from He I to\nthe leading and trailing arms of the wind shock cone passing tangentially\nthrough our line of sight. The simulations also explain the general strength\nand kinematics of the emission excess observed in wind lines such as C III\n$\\lambda$5696 of the system. These results represent the first in a series of\ninvestigations into the winds and properties of $\\gamma^2$ Velorum through\nmulti-technique and multi-wavelength observational campaigns.\n", "  In September 2016, the microquasar Cygnus X-3 underwent a giant radio flare,\nwhich was monitored for 6 days with the Medicina Radio Astronomical Station and\nthe Sardinia Radio Telescope. Long observations were performed in order to\nfollow the evolution of the flare on a hourly scale, covering six frequency\nranges from 1.5 GHz to 25.6 GHz. The radio emission reached a maximum of 13.2\n+/- 0.7 Jy at 7.2 GHz and 10 +/- 1 Jy at 18.6 GHz. Rapid flux variations were\nobserved at high radio frequencies at the peak of the flare, together with\nrapid evolution of the spectral index: alpha steepened from 0.3 to 0.6 within 5\nhours. This is the first time that such fast variations are observed, giving\nsupport to the evolution from optically thick to optically thin plasmons in\nexpansion moving outward from the core. Based on the Italian network (Noto,\nMedicina and SRT) and extended to the European antennas (Torun, Yebes, Onsala),\nVLBI observations were triggered at 22 GHz on five different occasions, four\ntimes prior to the giant flare, and once during its decay phase. Flux\nvariations of 2-hour duration were recorded during the first session. They\ncorrespond to a mini-flare that occurred close to the core ten days before the\nonset of the giant flare. From the latest VLBI observation we infer that four\ndays after the flare peak the jet emission was extended over 30 mas.\n", "  We describe new Hi-GAL based maps of the entire Galactic Plane, obtained\nusing continuum data in the wavelength range 70-500 $\\mu$m. These maps are\nderived with the PPMAP procedure, and therefore represent a significant\nimprovement over those obtained with standard analysis techniques. Specifically\nthey have greatly improved resolution (12 arcsec) and, in addition to more\naccurate integrated column densities and mean dust temperatures, they give\ntemperature-differential column densities, i.e., separate column density maps\nin twelve distinct dust temperature intervals, along with the corresponding\nuncertainty maps. The complete set of maps is available on-line. We briefly\ndescribe PPMAP and present some illustrative examples of the results. These\ninclude (a) multi-temperature maps of the Galactic HII region W5-E, (b) the\ntemperature decomposition of molecular cloud column-density probability\ndistribution functions, and (c) the global variation of mean dust temperature\nas a function of Galactocentric distance. Amongst our findings are: (i) a\nstrong localised temperature gradient in W5-E in a direction orthogonal to that\ntowards the ionising star, suggesting an alternative heating source and\nproviding possible guidance for models of the formation of the bubble complex,\nand (ii) the overall radial profile of dust temperature in the Galaxy shows a\nmonotonic decrease, broadly consistent both with models of the interstellar\nradiation field and with previous estimates at lower resolution. However, we\nalso find a central temperature plateau within ~ 6 kpc of the Galactic centre,\noutside of which is a pronounced steepening of the radial profile. This\nbehaviour may reflect the greater proportion of molecular (as opposed to\natomic) gas in the central region of the Galaxy.\n", "  It has been argued for years that the accretion mode changes from bright\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) to low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) at a rough\ndividing point of bolometric Eddington ratio $\\lambda \\sim 10^{-2}$. In this\nwork, we strengthen this scenario through investigation of the relationship\nbetween the radio loudness $R_{\\rm UV}$ and the optical-to-X-ray spectral index\n$\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ in LLAGNs with $10^{-6} \\lesssim \\lambda \\lesssim 10^{-3}$.\nWe compile from literature a sample of 32 LLAGNs, consisting 18 LINERs and 14\nlow Eddington ratio Seyfert galaxies, and observe a strong negative $R_{\\rm\nUV}$--$\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ relationship, with large scatter in both $R_{\\rm UV}$\nand $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$. We further demonstrate that this negative correlation,\nand the additional two negative relationships reported in literature ($R_{\\rm\nUV}$--$\\lambda$ and $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$--$\\lambda$ correlations), can be\nunderstood consistently and comprehensively under the truncated accretion--jet\nmodel, the model that has been applied successfully applied to LLAGNs. We argue\nthat the scatter in the observations are (mainly) due to the spread in the\nviscosity parameter $\\alpha$ of a hot accretion flow, a parameter that\npotentially can serve as a diagnose of the strength and/or configuration of\nmagnetic fields in accretion flows.\n", "  We characterize the absolute magnitudes and colors of RR Lyrae stars in the\nglobular cluster M5 in the ugriz filter system of the Dark Energy Camera\n(DECam). We provide empirical Period-Luminosity (P-L) relationships in all 5\nbands based on 47 RR Lyrae stars of the type ab and 14 stars of the type c. The\nP-L relationships were found to be better constrained for the fundamental mode\nRR Lyrae stars in the riz passbands, with dispersion of 0.03, 0.02 and 0.02\nmagnitudes, respectively. The dispersion of the color at minimum light was\nfound to be small, supporting the use of this parameter as a means to obtain\naccurate interstellar extinctions along the line of sight up to the distance of\nthe RR Lyrae star. We found a trend of color at minimum light with pulsational\nperiod that, if taken into account, brings the dispersion in color at minimum\nlight to < 0.016 magnitudes for the (r-i), (i-z), and (r-z) colors. These\ncalibrations will be very useful for using RR Lyrae stars from DECam\nobservations as both standard candles for distance determinations and color\nstandards for reddening measurements.\n", "  Cool stars with outer convective envelopes are observed to have magnetic\nfields with a variety of geometries, which on large scales are dominated by a\ncombination of the lowest order fields such as the dipole, quadrupole and\noctupole modes. Magnetised stellar wind outflows are primarily responsible for\nthe loss of angular momentum from these objects during the main sequence.\nPrevious works have shown the reduced effectiveness of the stellar wind braking\nmechanism with increasingly complex, but singular, magnetic field geometries.\nIn this paper, we quantify the impact of mixed dipolar and quadrupolar fields\non the spin-down torque using 50 MHD simulations with mixed field, along with\n10 of each pure geometries. The simulated winds include a wide range of\nmagnetic field strength and reside in the slow-rotator regime. We find that the\nstellar wind braking torque from our combined geometry cases are well described\nby a broken power law behaviour, where the torque scaling with field strength\ncan be predicted by the dipole component alone or the quadrupolar scaling\nutilising the total field strength. The simulation results can be scaled and\napply to all main-sequence cool stars. For Solar parameters, the lowest order\ncomponent of the field (dipole in this paper) is the most significant in\ndetermining the angular momentum loss.\n", "  We present our high-resolution\n($0^{\\prime\\prime}.15\\times0^{\\prime\\prime}.13$, $\\sim$34 pc) observations of\nthe CO(6-5) line emission, which probes the warm and dense molecular gas, and\nthe 434 $\\mu$m dust continuum emission in the nuclear region of the starburst\ngalaxy IC 5179, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The\nCO(6-5) emission is spatially distributed in filamentary structures with many\ndense cores and shows a velocity field that is characteristic of a\ncircum-nuclear rotating gas disk, with 90% of the rotation speed arising within\na radius of $\\lesssim150$ pc. At the scale of our spatial resolution, the\nCO(6-5) and dust emission peaks do not always coincide, with their surface\nbrightness ratio varying by a factor of $\\sim$10. This result suggests that\ntheir excitation mechanisms are likely different, as further evidenced by the\nSouthwest to Northeast spatial gradient of both CO-to-dust continuum ratio and\nPa-$\\alpha$ equivalent width. Within the nuclear region (radius$\\sim$300 pc)\nand with a resolution of $\\sim$34 pc, the CO line flux (dust flux density)\ndetected in our ALMA observations is $180\\pm18$ Jy km/s ($71\\pm7$ mJy), which\naccount for 22% (2.4%) of the total value measured by Herschel.\n", "  We present optical imaging and spectroscopic studies of the Fanaroff \\& Riley\nclass I (FR I) radio galaxy CTD 086 based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations. We use isophote shape analysis to\nshow that there is no stellar disk component within CTD 086 and further that\nthe morphological class of the galaxy is most likely E2. Optical spectroscopy\nof this galaxy reveals the presence of narrow emission lines only, and thus it\nqualifies to be termed as a narrow-line radio galaxy (type 2 AGN). We also\nextract stellar kinematics from the absorption-line spectra of CTD 086 using\nPenalized Pixel-Fitting method and derive the black hole mass MBH to be equal\nto (8.8\\pm2.4)\\times10^{7} Msun.\n", "  Ellerman bombs (EBs) have been widely studied over the past two decades;\nhowever, only recently have counterparts of these events been observed in the\nquiet-Sun. The aim of this article is to further understand small-scale\nquiet-Sun Ellerman-like brightenings (QSEBs) through research into their\nspectral signatures, including investigating whether the hot signatures\nassociated with some EBs are also visible co-spatial to any QSEBs. We combine\nH$\\alpha$ and Ca II $8542$ \\AA\\ line scans at the solar limb with spectral and\nimaging data sampled by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS).\nTwenty one QSEBs were identified with average lifetimes, lengths, and widths\nmeasured to be around $120$ s, $0.63$\", and $0.35$\", respectively. Three of\nthese QSEBs displayed clear repetitive flaring through their lifetimes,\ncomparable to the behaviour of EBs in Active Regions (ARs). Two QSEBs in this\nsample occurred co-spatial with increased emission in SDO/AIA $1600$ \\AA\\ and\nIRIS slit-jaw imager $1400$ \\AA\\ data, however, these intensity increases were\nsmaller than reported co-spatial to EBs. One QSEB was also sampled by the IRIS\nslit during its lifetime, displaying increases in intensity in the Si IV $1393$\n\\AA\\ and Si IV $1403$ \\AA\\ cores as well as the C II and Mg II line wings,\nanalogous to IRIS bursts (IBs). Using RADYN simulations, we are unable to\nreproduce the observed QSEB H$\\alpha$ and Ca II $8542$ \\AA\\ line profiles\nleaving the question of the temperature stratification of QSEBs open. Our\nresults imply that some QSEBs could be heated to Transition Region\ntemperatures, suggesting that IB profiles should be observed throughout the\nquiet-Sun.\n", "  Skyrmions are topologically nontrivial, magnetic quasi-particles, that are\ncharacterized by a topological charge. A regular array of skyrmions - a\nskyrmion crystal (SkX) - features the topological Hall effect (THE) of\nelectrons, that, in turn, gives rise to the Hall effect of the skyrmions\nthemselves. It is commonly believed that antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals\n(AFM-SkXs) lack both effects. In this Rapid Communication, we present a\ngenerally applicable method to create stable AFM-SkXs by growing a two\nsublattice SkX onto a collinear antiferromagnet. As an example we show that\nboth types of skyrmion crystals - conventional and antiferromagnetic - exist in\nhoneycomb lattices. While AFM-SkXs with equivalent lattice sites do not show a\nTHE, they exhibit a topological spin Hall effect. On top of this, AFM-SkXs on\ninequivalent sublattices exhibit a nonzero THE, which may be utilized in\nspintronics devices. Our theoretical findings call for experimental\nrealization.\n", "  We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to map the\nCO(3-2) and the underlying continuum emissions around the type 1 low-luminosity\nactive galactic nucleus (LLAGN; bolometric luminosity $\\lesssim 10^{42}$\nerg~s$^{-1}$) of NGC 1097 at $\\sim 10$ pc resolution. These observations\nrevealed a detailed cold gas distribution within a $\\sim 100$ pc of this LLAGN.\nIn contrast to the luminous Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, where a $\\sim 7$ pc cold\nmolecular torus was recently revealed, a distinctively dense and compact torus\nis missing in our CO(3-2) integrated intensity map of NGC 1097. Based on the\nCO(3-2) flux, the gas mass of the torus of NGC 1097 would be a factor of\n$\\gtrsim 2-3$ less than that found for NGC 1068 by using the same CO-to-H$_2$\nconversion factor, which implies less active nuclear star formation and/or\ninflows in NGC 1097. Our dynamical modeling of the CO(3-2) velocity field\nimplies that the cold molecular gas is concentrated in a thin layer as compared\nto the hot gas traced by the 2.12 $\\mu$m H$_2$ emission in and around the\ntorus. Furthermore, we suggest that NGC 1097 hosts a geometrically thinner\ntorus than NGC 1068. Although the physical origin of the torus thickness\nremains unclear, our observations support a theoretical prediction that\ngeometrically thick tori with high opacity will become deficient as AGNs evolve\nfrom luminous Seyferts to LLAGNs.\n", "  We investigated the magnetic structure of the heavy fermion compound\nCePt$_2$In$_7$ below $T_N~=5.34(2)$ K using magnetic resonant X-ray diffraction\nat ambient pressure. The magnetic order is characterized by a commensurate\npropagation vector ${k}_{1/2}~=~\\left( \\frac{1}{2} , \\frac{1}{2},\n\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ with spins lying in the basal plane. Our measurements did\nnot reveal the presence of an incommensurate order propagating along the high\nsymmetry directions in reciprocal space but cannot exclude other incommensurate\nmodulations or weak scattering intensities. The observed commensurate order can\nbe described equivalently by either a single-${k}$ structure or by a\nmulti-${k}$ structure. Furthermore we explain how a commensurate-only ordering\nmay explain the broad distribution of internal fields observed in nuclear\nquadrupolar resonance experiments (Sakai et al. 2011, Phys. Rev. B 83 140408)\nthat was previously attributed to an incommensurate order. We also report\npowder X-ray diffraction showing that the crystallographic structure of\nCePt$_2$In$_7$ changes monotonically with pressure up to $P~=~7.3$ GPa at room\ntemperature. The determined bulk modulus $B_0~=~81.1(3)$ GPa is similar to the\nones of the Ce-115 family. Broad diffraction peaks confirm the presence of\npronounced strain in polycrystalline samples of CePt$_2$In$_7$. We discuss how\nstrain effects can lead to different electronic and magnetic properties between\npolycrystalline and single crystal samples.\n", "  Previously [Y/Mg] has been proven to be an age indicator for solar twins.\nHere, we investigate if this relation also holds for helium-core-burning stars\nof solar metallicity. High resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)\nspectroscopic data of stars in the helium-core-burning phase have been obtained\nwith the FIES spectrograph on the NOT 2.56m telescope and the HIRES\nspectrograph on the Keck I 10 m telescope. They have been analyzed to determine\nthe chemical abundances of four open clusters with close to solar metallicity;\nNGC 6811, NGC 6819, M67 and NGC 188. The abundances are derived from equivalent\nwidths of spectral lines using ATLAS9 model atmospheres with parameters\ndetermined from the excitation and ionization balance of Fe lines. Results from\nasteroseismology and binary studies were used as priors on the atmospheric\nparameters, where especially the $\\log g$ is determined to much higher\nprecision than what is possible with spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the\nfour open clusters are close to solar metallicity and they follow the [Y/Mg]\nvs. age trend previously found for solar twins. The [Y/Mg] vs. age clock also\nworks for giant stars in the helium-core burning phase, which vastly increases\nthe possibilities to estimate the age of stars not only in the solar\nneighborhood, but in large parts of the Galaxy, due to the brighter nature of\nevolved stars compared to dwarfs.\n", "  We investigate charge fractionalizations in artificial Tomonaga-Luttinger\nliquids (TLLs) composed of two capacitively coupled quantum Hall edge channels\n(ECs) in graphene. The interaction strength of the artificial TLLs can be\ncontrolled through distance W between the ECs. We show that the\nfractionalization ratio r and the TLL mode velocity v vary with W. The\nexperimentally obtained relation between v and r follows a unique function\npredicted by the TLL theory. We also show that charged wavepackets are\nreflected back and forth multiple times at both ends of the TLL region.\n", "  The solar meridional flow is a crucial ingredient in modern dynamo theory.\nSeismic estimates of this flow have, however, been contradictory in deeper\nlayers below about $0.9\\,R_\\odot$. Results from time-distance helioseismology\nhave so far been obtained using the ray approximation. Here, we perform\ninversions using the Born approximation. The initial result is similar to the\nresult previously obtained by Jackiewicz et al. (2015) using ray kernels while\nusing the same set of GONG data and the SOLA inversion technique. However, we\nshow that the assumption of uncorrelated measurements used in earlier studies\nmay lead to inversion errors being underestimated by a factor of about two to\nfour. In a second step, refined inversions are performed using the full\ncovariance matrix and a regularization for cross-talk. As the results are found\nto depend on the threshold used in the singular value decomposition, they were\nobtained for a medium threshold ($10^{-7}-10^{-5}$, about 50% of the values\nused) and a threshold lower by a factor of 10 (about 70% of the values used).\nThe result obtained with the medium threshold is again similar to the original,\nwith less latitudinal variation. However, using the lower threshold, the\ninverted flow in the southern hemisphere shows two or three cells stacked\nradially depending on the associated radial flows. Both the single-cell and the\nmulti-cell profiles are consistent with the measured travel times. All our\nresults confirm a shallow return flow at about $0.9\\,R_\\odot$.\n", "  The Earth and other rocky bodies in the inner solar system contain\nsignificantly less carbon than the primordial materials that seeded their\nformation. These carbon-poor objects include the parent bodies of primitive\nmeteorites, suggesting that at least one process responsible for solid-phase\ncarbon depletion was active prior to the early stages of planet formation.\nPotential mechanisms include the erosion of carbonaceous materials by photons\nor atomic oxygen in the surface layers of the protoplanetary disk. Under\nphotochemically generated favorable conditions, these reactions can deplete the\nnear-surface abundance of carbon grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by\nseveral orders of magnitude on short timescales relative to the lifetime of the\ndisk out to radii of ~20-100+ au from the central star depending on the form of\nrefractory carbon present. Due to the reliance of destruction mechanisms on a\nhigh influx of photons, the extent of refractory carbon depletion is quite\nsensitive to the disk's internal radiation field. Dust transport within the\ndisk is required to affect the composition of the midplane. In our current\nmodel of a passive, constant-alpha disk, where alpha = 0.01, carbon grains can\nbe turbulently lofted into the destructive surface layers and depleted out to\nradii of ~3-10 au for 0.1-1 um grains. Smaller grains can be cleared out of the\nplanet-forming region completely. Destruction may be more effective in an\nactively accreting disk or when considering individual grain trajectories in\nnon-idealized disks.\n", "  The transition from quantum to classical statistics is studied in light of\nHuggett's finding that the empirical data do not support the usual claim that\nthe distinction between classical and quantum objects consists in the capacity\nof classical objects to carry permutable labels as opposed to quantum objects.\nSince permutation of the labels of classical objects counts as a distinct\nconfiguration, this feature is usually taken as signifying that classical\nobjects are not identical while quantum objects are. Huggett's finding\nthreatens that characterization of the distinction between classical and\nquantum objects. The various statistical distributions are examined, and it is\nfound that other distinctions, corresponding to separability and\ndistinguishability, emerge in the classical limit. The role of the chemical\npotential (the rate of change of the Helmholtz free energy with particle\nnumber) is found to be of crucial significance in characterizing this emergence\nof classicality from the quantum distributions.\n", "  The quantum statistics of particles is determined by both the spins and the\nindistinguishability of quantum states. Here we studied the quantum statistics\nof partially distinguishable photons by defining the multi-photon\nindistinguishability. The photon bunching co-efficient was formulated based on\nthe properties of permutation symmetry, and a modified Bose--Einstein\nstatistics was presented with an indistinguishability induced photon bunching\neffect. Moreover, the statistical transition of the photon state was studied\nfor partially distinguishable photons, and the results shows the that\nindistinguishability exhibits the same role as that observed in the generation\nof laser. The results will fill the gap between Bose--Einstein and Poisson\nstatistics for photons, and a formula is presented for the study of\nmulti-photon quantum information processes.\n", "  We study lithium depletion in low-mass and solar-like stars as a function of\ntime, using a new diffusion coefficient describing extra-mixing taking place at\nthe bottom of a convective envelope. This new form is motivated by\nmulti-dimensional fully compressible, time implicit hydrodynamic simulations\nperformed with the MUSIC code. Intermittent convective mixing at the convective\nboundary in a star can be modeled using extreme value theory, a statistical\nanalysis frequently used for finance, meteorology, and environmental science.\nIn this letter, we implement this statistical diffusion coefficient in a\none-dimensional stellar evolution code, using parameters calibrated from\nmulti-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a young low-mass star. We propose\na new scenario that can explain observations of the surface abundance of\nlithium in the Sun and in clusters covering a wide range of ages, from $\\sim$\n50 Myr to $\\sim$ 4 Gyr. Because it relies on our physical model of convective\npenetration, this scenario has a limited number of assumptions. It can explain\nthe observed trend between rotation and depletion, based on a single additional\nassumption, namely that rotation affects the mixing efficiency at the\nconvective boundary. We suggest the existence of a threshold in stellar\nrotation rate above which rotation strongly prevents the vertical penetration\nof plumes and below which rotation has small effects. In addition to providing\na possible explanation for the long standing problem of lithium depletion in\npre-main sequence and main sequence stars, the strength of our scenario is that\nits basic assumptions can be tested by future hydrodynamic simulations.\n", "  Dust devils are likely the dominant source of dust for the martian\natmosphere, but the amount and frequency of dust-lifting depend on the\nstatistical distribution of dust devil parameters. Dust devils exhibit pressure\nperturbations and, if they pass near a barometric sensor, they may register as\na discernible dip in a pressure time-series. Leveraging this fact, several\nsurveys using barometric sensors on landed spacecraft have revealed dust devil\nstructures and occurrence rates. However powerful they are, though, such\nsurveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust devil\nproperties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with\nthe widest and deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be\ndistorted, broader and shallow than the actual profiles. In addition, such\nsurveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside the pressure\ntime series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series\ncannot be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical\nand geometric considerations can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of\nthe duration of dust devil signals into physical widths, given only a\ndistribution of likely translation velocities, and the recovery of the\nunderlying distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a\nscheme for de-biasing such surveys. Applying our model to an in-situ survey\nusing data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust flux and a dust devil\noccurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing our\nresults to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five\nlow-pressure cells lifts sufficient dust to leave a visible track.\n", "  We present a map of the near subsurface hydrogen distribution on Mars, based\non epithermal neutron data from the Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer. The\nmap's spatial resolution is approximately improved two-fold via a new form of\nthe pixon image reconstruction technique. We discover hydrogen-rich mineralogy\nfar from the poles, including ~10 wt. % water equivalent hydrogen (WEH) on the\nflanks of the Tharsis Montes and greater than 40 wt. % WEH at the Medusae\nFossae Formation (MFF). The high WEH abundance at the MFF implies the presence\nof bulk water ice. This supports the hypothesis of recent periods of high\norbital obliquity during which water ice was stable on the surface. We find the\nyoung undivided channel system material in southern Elysium Planitia to be\ndistinct from its surroundings and exceptionally dry; there is no evidence of\nhydration at the location in Elysium Planitia suggested to contain a buried\nwater ice sea. Finally, we find that the sites of recurring slope lineae (RSL)\ndo not correlate with subsurface hydration. This implies that RSL are not fed\nby large, near-subsurface aquifers, but are instead the result of either small\n(less than 120 km diameter) aquifers, deliquescence of perchlorate and chlorate\nsalts or dry, granular flows.\n", "  We prove two general theorems which determine the Lie and the Noether point\nsymmetries for the equations of motion of a dynamical system which moves in a\ngeneral Riemannian space under the action of a time dependent potential\n$W(t,x)=\\omega(t)V(x)$. We apply the theorems to the case of a time dependent\ncentral potential and the harmonic oscillator and determine all Lie and Noether\npoint symmetries. Finally we prove that these theorems also apply to the case\nof a dynamical system with linear dumping and study two examples.\n", "  Valleytronics is one of the breaking-through to the technology of\nelectronics, which provides a new degree of freedom to manipulate the\nproperties of electrons. Combining DFT calculations, optical absorption\nanalysis and the linear polarization-resolved transmission measurement\ntogether, we report that three pairs of valleys, which feature opposite optical\nabsorption, existing in the 3-dimensional (3D) group-IV monochalcogenids. By\napplying the linearly-polarized light, valley polarization is successfully\ngenerated for the first time in a 3D system, which opens a new direction for\nthe exploration of the valley materials and provides a good platform for the\nphotodetector and valleytronic devices. Valley modulation versus the in-plane\nstrain in GeSe is also studied, suggesting an effective way to get the\noptimized valleytronic properties.\n", "  Zahn's theory of dynamical tides is analyzed critically. We compare the\nresults of this theory with our numerical calculations for stars with a\nconvective core and a radiative envelope and with masses of one and a half and\ntwo solar masses. We show that for a binary system consisting of stars of one\nand a half or two solar masses and a point object with a mass equal to the\nsolar mass and with an orbital period of one day under the assumption of a\ndense spectrum and moderately rapid dissipation, the evolution time scales of\nthe semimajor axis will be shorter than those in Zahn's theory by several\norders of magnitude\n", "  In the Yukawa model for nuclear forces, a simple relation between the charged\nand neutral pion-nucleon coupling constants is derived. The relation implies\nthat the charged pion-nucleon coupling constant is larger than the neutral one\nsince the np interaction is stronger than the pp interaction. The derived value\nof the charged pion-nucleon constant shows a very good agreement with one of\nthe recent experimental values. The relative splitting between the charged and\nneutral pion-nucleon coupling constants is predicted to be practically the same\nas that between the charged and neutral pion masses. The charge dependence of\nthe NN scattering length arising from the mass difference between the charged\nand neutral pions is also analyzed.\n", "  We consider a tachyon field whose Fourier components correspond to spatial\nmomenta with modulus smaller than the mass parameter. The plane wave solutions\nhave them a time evolution which is a real exponential. The field is quantized\nand the solution of the eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian leads to the\nevaluation of the vacuum expectation value of products of field operators. The\npropagator turns out to be half-advanced and half-retarded. This completes the\nproof [4] that the total propagator is the Wheeler Green function [4,7].\n", "  Following the canonical quantization procedure for a tachyon field, the usual\nHamiltonian and the creation and annihilation operators are obtained. The\nobservation that the mass hyperboloid $p^2-m^2=0$ is one-sheeted, as opposed to\nthe case of bradyons where $p^2+m^2=0$ is two-sheeted, leads to the\nconstruction of a base which is unbounded for negative as well as for positive\nenergies. There is a zero-energy eigenfunction from which all other states can\nbe constructed by repeated application of decreasing or increasing operators,\nwithin this Fock space the vacuum expectation value of the chronological\nproduct of field operators is shown to coincide with Cauchy's principal-value\nGreen's function.\n", "  We investigate entanglement and quantum phase transition (QPT) in a\ntwo-dimensional Heisenberg anisotropic spin-1/2 XY model, using quantum\nrenormalization group method (QRG) on a square lattice of $N\\times N$ sites.\nThe entanglement through geometric average of concurrences is calculated after\neach step of the QRG. We show that the concurrence achieves a non zero value at\nthe critical point more rapidly as compared to one-dimensional case. The\nrelationship between the entanglement and the quantum phase transition is\nstudied. The evolution of entanglement develops two saturated values\ncorresponding to two different phases. We compute the first derivative of the\nconcurrence, which is found to be discontinuous at the critical point\n$\\gamma=0$, and indicates a second-order phase transition in the spin system.\nFurther, the scaling behaviour of the system is investigated by computing the\nfirst derivative of the concurrence in terms of the system size.\n", "  The local organisation of a simulated glass-forming mixture due to Kob and\nAndersen is analysed. Evidence is presented for a structural transition from\ntriangulated coordination polyhedra to cubic as the number fraction of the\nsmaller species B increases towards equimolar. The impact of the change on the\npartial radial distribution function g-{BB}(r) is established. The dependence\nof the crystallisation rate on the composition is determined and the related to\nthe observed structural changes.\n", "  The current work presents a new single-reference method for capturing at the\nsame time the static and dynamic electron correlation. The starting-point is a\ndeterminant wavefunction formed with natural orbitals obtained from a new\ninteracting-pair model. The latter leads to a natural orbital functional (NOF)\ncapable of recovering the complete intra-pair, but only the static inter-pair\ncorrelation. Using the solution of the NOF, two new energy functionals are\ndefined for both dynamic (Edyn) and static (Esta) correlation. Edyn is derived\nfrom a modified second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), while\nEsta is obtained from the static component of the new NOF. Double counting is\navoided by introducing the amount of static and dynamic correlation in each\norbital as a function of its occupation. As a result, the total energy is\nrepresented by the sum Ehf + Edyn + Esta, where Ehf is the Hartree-Fock energy\nobtained with natural orbitals. The new procedure called NOF-MP2 scales\nformally as O(M^5)(M: number of basis functions), and is applied successfully\nto the homolytic dissociation of a selected set of diatomic molecules,\nparadigmatic cases of near-degeneracy effects. Its size-consistency has been\nnumerically demonstrated for singlets. The values obtained are in good\nagreement with the experimental data.\n", "  Investigating in detail the physics of energy filtering through a single\nplanar energy barrier in nanostructured thermoelectric generators, we reinforce\nthe non-trivial result that the anticipated enhancement in generated power at a\ngiven efficiency via energy filtering is a characteristic of systems dominated\nby incoherent scattering and is absent in ballistic devices. In such cases,\nassuming an energy dependent relaxation time $\\tau(E)=kE^r$, we show that there\nexists a minimum value $r_{min}$ beyond which generation can be enhanced by\nembedding nanobarriers. For bulk generators with embedded nanobarriers, we\ndelve into the details of inter sub-band scattering and show that it has finite\ncontribution to the enhancement in generation. We subsequently discuss the\nrealistic aspects, such as the effect of smooth transmission cut-off and show\nthat for $r>r_{min}$, the optimized energy barrier is just sufficiently wide\nenough to scatter off low energy electrons, a very wide barrier being\ndetrimental to the performance. Analysis of the obtained results should provide\ngeneral design guidelines for enhancement in thermoelectric generation via\nenergy filtering. Our non-equilibrium approach is typically valid in the\nabsence of local quasi-equilibrium and hence sets the stage for future\nadvancements in thermoelectric device analysis, for example, Peltier cooling\nnear a barrier interface.\n", "  The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is designed to provide an unprecedented\noptical imaging dataset that will support investigations of our Solar System,\nGalaxy and Universe, across half the sky and over ten years of repeated\nobservation. However, exactly how the LSST observations will be taken (the\nobserving strategy or \"cadence\") is not yet finalized. In this\ndynamically-evolving community white paper, we explore how the detailed\nperformance of the anticipated science investigations is expected to depend on\nsmall changes to the LSST observing strategy. Using realistic simulations of\nthe LSST schedule and observation properties, we design and compute diagnostic\nmetrics and Figures of Merit that provide quantitative evaluations of different\nobserving strategies, analyzing their impact on a wide range of proposed\nscience projects. This is work in progress: we are using this white paper to\ncommunicate to each other the relative merits of the observing strategy choices\nthat could be made, in an effort to maximize the scientific value of the\nsurvey. The investigation of some science cases leads to suggestions for new\nstrategies that could be simulated and potentially adopted. Notably, we find\nmotivation for exploring departures from a spatially uniform annual tiling of\nthe sky: focusing instead on different parts of the survey area in different\nyears in a \"rolling cadence\" is likely to have significant benefits for a\nnumber of time domain and moving object astronomy projects. The communal\nassembly of a suite of quantified and homogeneously coded metrics is the vital\nfirst step towards an automated, systematic, science-based assessment of any\ngiven cadence simulation, that will enable the scheduling of the LSST to be as\nwell-informed as possible.\n", "  Stagnation of grain growth is often attributed to impurity segregation.\nYttria-stabilized cubic zirconia does not evidence any segregation-induced\nslowdown, as its grain growth obeys the parabolic law when the grain size\nincreases by more than one order of magnitude. However, lowering the\ntemperature below 1300 oC triggers an abrupt slowdown, constraining the average\ngrains to grow by less than 0.5 ${\\mu}$m in 1000 h despite a relatively large\ndriving force imparted in the fine grains of ~0.5 ${\\mu}$m. Yet isolated\npockets of abnormally large grains, along with pockets of abnormally small\ngrains, emerge in the same latter sample. Such microstructure bifurcation has\nnever been observed before, and can only be explained by an inhomogeneous\ndistribution of immobile four-grain junctions. The implications of these\nfindings for two-step sintering are discussed.\n", "  Conventional grain growth is rate-limited by the mobility of grain boundary.\nTo describe similar phenomena limited by the mobility of other grain junctions,\nwe have developed a general theory allowing for size-dependent mobility and its\nstatistical variance. We obtained analytic solutions for the steady-state size\ndistribution and the growth exponent, defined as (grain size)n ~ time, down to\nn=1, which arises when the mobility of three-grain lines is rate-limiting. When\nthe mobility of four-grain junctions is rate-limiting, exponential growth and a\nbifurcating size distribution result. These solutions manifest a general trend:\nThe size distribution narrows with increasing n. Yet experimentally the\nopposite trend has been observed recently, which can only be reproduced in\nsimulation if the mobility distribution is made at lease bimodal, with one mode\nbeing immobile or nearly immobile. The latter can be realized in slow grain\ngrowth below the temperature of mobility transition.\n", "  In general relativity, `causal structure' refers to the partial order on\nspace-time points (or regions) that encodes time-like relationships. Recently,\nquantum information and quantum foundations saw the emergence of a `causality\nprinciple'. In the form used in this paper, which we call `process\nterminality', it states that when the output of a process is discarded, then\nthe process itself may as well be discarded. While causal structure and process\nterminality at first seem to be entirely different notions, they become\nequivalent when making explicit what the partial order actually encodes, that\nis, that an event in the past can influence one in its future, but not\nvice-versa. The framework in which we establish this equivalence is that of\nprocess theories. We show how several previous results are instances of this\nresult and comment on how this framework could provide an ideal, minimal canvas\nfor crafting theories of quantum gravity.\n", "  We classify a number of symmetry protected phases using Freed-Hopkins'\nhomotopy theoretic classification. Along the way we compute the low-dimensional\nhomotopy groups of a number of novel cobordism spectra.\n", "  It is hypothesized that the Langevin time of stochastic quantum quantization\nis a physical time over which quantum fields at all values of space and\ncoordinate time fluctuate. The average over paths becomes a time average as\nopposed to an ensemble average. It is further hypothesized that the Langevin\ntime also paces the motion of particles through coordinate time and is equal to\nthe coordinate time of the present hypersurface in the frame of the Hubble\nexpansion. Despite having a preferred frame, special relativity continues to\nhold in this formulation as a dynamical symmetry due to the presumed Lorentz\ninvariance of interactions. The measurement process becomes an integral part of\nthe theory and is realized as a process of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The\ncontinuously fluctuating history of fields, characteristic of having two times,\nand the switch from ensemble averages to time averages allows for logical and\nstraightforward explanations of many quantum measurement paradoxes. The\nfluctuating history also evades hidden-variable prohibitions allowing an\nessentially classical system to underlie quantum mechanics. These changes to\nthe stochastic quantization paradigm makes this stochastic classical system\ndiffer somewhat from standard quantum mechanics, so, in principle,\ndistinguishable from it.\n", "  We present a visibility based estimator namely, the Tapered Gridded Estimator\n(TGE) to estimate the power spectrum of the diffuse sky signal. The TGE has\nthree novel features. First, the estimator uses gridded visibilities to\nestimate the power spectrum which is computationally much faster than\nindividually correlating the visibilities. Second, a positive noise bias is\nremoved by subtracting the auto-correlation of the visibilities which is\nresponsible for the noise bias. Third, the estimator allows us to taper the\nfield of view so as to suppress the contribution from the sources in the outer\nregions and the sidelobes of the telescope's primary beam. We first consider\nthe two dimensional (2D) TGE to estimate the angular power spectrum $C_{\\ell}$.\nWe have also extended the TGE to estimate the three dimensional (3D) power\nspectrum $P({\\bf k})$ of the cosmological 21-cm signal. Analytic formulas are\npresented for predicting the variance of the binned power spectrum. Both the\nestimators and their variance predictions are validated using simulations of\n$150 \\, {\\rm MHz}$ GMRT observations. We have applied the 2D TGE to estimate\n$C_{\\ell}$ using visibility data for two of the fields observed by TIFR GMRT\nSky Survey (TGSS). We find that the sky signal, after subtracting the point\nsources, is likely dominated by the diffuse Galactic synchrotron radiation\nacross the angular multipole range $240 \\le \\ell \\lesssim 500$.\n", "  We demonstrate complete quantum state transfer of an atomic Bose-Einstein\ncondensate to molecular condensate, mediated by solitonic excitations in a\ncigar shaped mean-field geometry. Starting with a localized solitonic atomic\ncondensate, we show compatible gray solitonic configuration in the molecular\ncondensate, which results in complete atom-molecule conversion. The effect of\ninter and intra-species interactions on the formation of molecular condensate\nis explicated in the presence of Raman Photoassociation. It is found that\nphotoassociation plays a crucial role in the coherent atom-molecule conversion\nas well as in the soliton dynamics. The gray soliton dispersion reveals\nbistable behaviour, showing a re-entrant phase in a physically accessible\nparametric domain.\n", "  The fourth-gradient model for fluids-associated with an extended molecular\nmean-field theory of capillarity-is considered. By producing fluctuations of\ndensity near the critical point like in computational molecular dynamics, the\nmodel is more realistic and richer than van der Waals' one and other models\nassociated with a second order expansion. The aim of the paper is to prove-with\na fourth-gradient internal energy already obtained by the mean field\ntheory-that the quasi-linear system of conservation laws can be written in an\nHermitian symmetric form implying the stability of constant solutions. The\nresult extends the symmetric hyperbolicity property of governing-equations'\nsystems when an equation of energy associated with high order deformation of a\ncontinuum medium is taken into account.\n", "  We develop the Titchmarsh-Weyl theory for vector-valued discrete\nSchr\\\"odinger operators and show that the Weyl $m$ functions associated with\nthese operators map complex upper half plane to the Siegel upper half space. We\nalso discuss about the Weyl disk and Weyl circle corresponding to these\noperators.\n", "  In this work, which is based on an essential linear analysis carried out by\nChristodoulou, we study the evolution of tidal energy for the motion of two\ngravitating incompressible fluid balls with free boundaries obeying the\nEuler-Poisson equations. The orbital energy is defined as the mechanical energy\nof the two bodies' center of mass. According to the classical analysis of\nKepler and Newton, when the fluids are replaced by point masses, the conic\ncurve describing the trajectories of the masses is a hyperbola when the orbital\nenergy is positive and an ellipse when the orbital energy is negative. The\norbital energy is conserved in the case of point masses. If the point masses\nare initially very far, then the orbital energy is positive, corresponding to\nhyperbolic motion. However, in the motion of fluid bodies the orbital energy is\nno longer conserved because part of the conserved energy is used in deforming\nthe boundaries of the bodies. In this case the total energy\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{E}}$ can be decomposed into a sum\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{E}}:=\\widetilde{\\mathcal{E}_{{\\mathrm{orbital}}}}+\\widetilde{\\mathcal{E}_{{\\mathrm{tidal}}}}$,\nwith $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{E}_{{\\mathrm{tidal}}}}$ measuring the energy used in\ndeforming the boundaries, such that if\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{E}_{{\\mathrm{orbital}}}}<-c<0$ for some absolute constant\n$c>0$, then the orbit of the bodies must be bounded. In this work we prove that\nunder appropriate conditions on the initial configuration of the system, the\nfluid boundaries and velocity remain regular up to the point of the first\nclosest approach in the orbit, and that the tidal energy\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{E}_{{\\mathrm{tidal}}}}$ can be made arbitrarily large\nrelative to the total energy $\\tilde{\\mathcal{E}}$. In particular under these\nconditions $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{E}_{{\\mathrm{orbital}}}}$, which is initially\npositive, becomes negative before the point of the first closest approach.\n", "  We have studied several color-color infrared diagrams of the 276 late type\nstars of the BIS catalog. For 95 of these stars we derived spectral\nclassification from our slit spectroscopy. From the 2MASS color diagram we\nderive that none of the sample stars is a dwarf. The WISE 3.4-12 vs 12-22 plot\nis the best to discriminate the variability type (Mira, irregular and\nnot-variable), as well as Carbon stars: IRAS colors are less useful due to the\npoor quality of the data for most of the BIS stars. Mixed plots involving\n2MASS, AKARI and WISE were also explored: the 2MASS-AKARI J-[S09] vs\n[S09]-[L18] plot is efficient to discriminate Carbon and Mira stars. From the\ncolor plots and our spectroscopy we can statistically predict that in whole BIS\ncatalog no other dusty Carbon star is present, while a few Miras and CH or R\nCarbon stars could be discovered. Only about 15 percent of the BIS stars are of\nearly M type.\n", "  A new Strouhal-Reynolds number relationship, $St=1/(A+B/Re)$, has been\nrecently proposed based on observations of laminar vortex shedding from\ncircular cylinders in a flowing soap film. Since the new $St$-$Re$ relation was\nderived from a general physical consideration, it raises the possibility that\nit may be applicable to vortex shedding from bodies other than circular ones.\nThe work presented herein provides experimental evidence that this is the case.\nOur measurements also show that in the asymptotic limit\n($Re\\rightarrow\\infty$), $St_{\\infty}=1/A\\simeq0.21$ is constant independent of\nrod shapes, leaving $B$ the only parameter that is shape dependent.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally a simple and easy-to-use technique aimed at\nmeasuring the complex orbital angular momentum spectrum of an arbitrary optical\nfield making use of just polarization measurements. The technique can be\napplied to any other family of modes used to describe the spatial shape of\noptical beams. The idea is inspired by a formal analogy that exists between\nclassical fields that can show a certain amount of correlations between\ndifferent degrees of freedom (polarization and spatial shape) and the degree of\nentanglement that might exist between two subsystems, so it is an example of a\nquantum-inspired classical technology.\n", "  The paper provides a qualitative and numerical analysis-based investigation\nof cosmological models founded on an asymmetrical scalar doublet comprising of\na classical and a phantom scalar fields. Presence of a phantom scalar field\nallows one to consider also classical scalar fields with attraction of\nlike-charged particles which significantly extends a diversity of cosmological\nmodels' behaviours. It is shown that a cosmological model based on an\nasymmetric scalar doublet in the case of minimal interaction has 9 singular\npoints 2 of which are attractive and the rest are non-stable saddle ones. It is\nalso shown that a presence of even essentially weak phantom field significantly\nchanges the dynamics of a cosmological model.\n", "  Community detection in networks is the process of identifying unusually\nwell-connected sub-networks and is a central component of many applied network\nanalyses. The paradigm of modularity optimization stipulates a partition of the\nnetwork's vertices which maximizes the difference between the fraction of edges\nwithin groups (communities) and the expected fraction if edges were randomly\ndistributed. The modularity objective function incorporates the network's\ntopology exclusively and has been extensively studied whereas the integration\nof constraints or external information on community composition has largely\nremained unexplored. We impose a penalty function on the modularity objective\nfunction to regulate the constitution of communities and apply our methodology\nin identifying health care communities (HCCs) within a network of hospitals\nsuch that the number of cardiac defibrillator surgeries performed within each\nHCC exceeds a minimum threshold. This restriction permits meaningful\ncomparisons in cardiac care among the resulting health care communities by\nstandardizing the distribution of cardiac care across the hospital network.\n", "  In arXiv:1707.08641, Tim Maudlin claims to construct a counterexample to the\nresult of Proc. Roy. Soc. A vol. 473, iss. 2202, 2017 (arXiv:1607.07871), in\nwhich it was shown that no realist model satisfying a certain notion of\ntime-symmetry (in addition to three other assumptions) can reproduce the\npredictions of quantum theory without retrocausality (influences travelling\nbackwards in time). In this comment, I explain why Maudlin's model is not a\ncounterexample because it does not satisfy our time-symmetry assumption. I also\nexplain why Maudlin's claim that one of the Lemmas we used in our proof is\nincorrect is wrong.\n", "  Roles played by the currents in the impulsive phase of a solar flare and in a\ncoronal mass ejection (CME) are reviewed. Solar flares are magnetic explosions:\nmagnetic energy stored in unneutralized currents in coronal loops is released\ninto energetic electrons in the impulsive phase and into mass motion in a CME.\nThe energy release is due to a change in current configuration effectively\nreducing the net current path. A flare is driven by the electromotive force\n(EMF) due to the changing magnetic flux. The EMF drives a flare-associated\ncurrent whose cross-field closure is achieved by redirection along field lines\nto the chromosphere and back. The essential roles that currents play are\nobscured in the \"standard\" model and are described incorrectly in circuit\nmodels. A semi-quantitative treatment of the energy and the EMF is provided by\na multi-current model, in which the currents are constant and the change in the\ncurrent paths is described by time-dependent inductances. There is no\nself-consistent model that includes the intrinsic time dependence, the EMF, the\nflare-associated current and the internal energy transport during a flare. The\ncurrent, through magnetic helicity, plays an important role in a CME, with\ntwist converted into writhe allowing the kink instability plus reconnection to\nlead to a new closed loop, and with the current-current force accelerating the\nCME through the torus instability.\n", "  We investigate the realization of conditional displacement interaction in the\ntransversal direction in ultrastrongly coupled circuit quantum electrodynamics\nby adjusting parameters of external magnetic fields. The special interaction is\nderived in the system of charge qubit(s) coupled to a LC resonator. We\nconsolidate the implementation of quantum gates and the generation of\nsuperposed coherent states based on the transversal conditional displacement\ninteraction numerically. The conditional displacement interaction in the\nultrastrong coupling regime enhances quantum process to operate at the time\nscale of nanoseconds.\n", "  Chimera patterns, characterized by coexisting regions of phase coherence and\nincoherence, have so far been studied in non-conservative systems with\ndissipation. Here, we show that the formation of chimera patterns can also be\nobserved in conservative Hamiltonian systems with nonlocal hopping in which\nboth energy and particle number are conserved. Effective nonlocality can be\nrealized in a physical system with only local coupling if different time scales\nexist, which can be illustrated by a minimal conservative model with an\nadditional mediating channel. Finally, we show that the patterns should be\nobservable in ultracold atomic systems. Nonlocal spatial hopping over up to\ntens of lattice sites with independently tunable hopping strength and on-site\nnonlinearity can be implemented in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate\nwith a spin-dependent optical lattice, where the untrapped component serves as\nthe matter-wave mediating field. The present work highlights the connections\nbetween chimera patterns, nonlinear dynamics, condensed matter, and ultracold\natoms.\n", "  The dynamics of relativistic runaway electrons are analyzed using the\nrelativistic Fokker-Planck equation including deceleration due to the\nsynchrotron radiation and radial diffusion loss caused by stochastic magnetic\nfluctuations (SMFs). SMFs are treated as friction force in [J. Martin-Solis et\nal., Phys. Plasmas 6, 3925 (1999)]. However, we think SMFs act as a porter in\nconfiguration space, but not directly affect the runaway electrons (REs) in\nmomentum space. Both critical electric fields for sustainment of the existing\nREs and for avalanche onset are enhanced, and the modified avalanche growth\nrate is reduced by the combined effects of SMFs and synchrotron radiation as\ncompared to the case with only synchrotron radiation [P. Aleynikov et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 114, 155001 (2015)].\n", "  Significant effects of impurities on residual zonal flow (ZF) in deuterium\n(D)-tritium (T) plasmas are found. When the gyroradius of impurities is larger\n(smaller) than that of main ions, the intermediate scale (radial wavelength\nbetween trapped ion radial width $\\rho_{bi}$ and trapped electron radial width\n$\\rho_{be}$) residual ZF level is increased (decreased) due to the presence of\nvarious impurities with the tolerance concentration in JET and ITER, even for\ntrace tungsten (W). For short scale (radial wavelength comparable to\n$\\rho_{be}$) region, the residual ZF level is increased by most of the\nimpurities. Moreover, the trend of stronger intermediate residual ZF in D-T\nplasmas with heavier effective isotope mass is weakened by non-trace\nimpurities, but is not influenced by trace W. These results reveal that the\npresence of impurities can modify residual ZF, and possibly further affect the\nZF regulation of turbulence as well as the associated anomalous transport and\nconfinement in magnetic fusion plasmas. The potential relevance of our findings\nto experimental observations and simulation results is discussed.\n", "  It is common to introduce optical tweezers using either geometric optics for\nlarge particles or the Rayleigh approximation for very small particles. These\napproaches are successful at conveying the key ideas behind optical tweezers in\ntheir respective regimes. However, they are insufficient for modelling\nparticles of intermediate size and large particles with small features. For\nthis, a full field approach provides greater insight into the mechanisms\ninvolved in trapping. The advances in computational capability over the last\ndecade has led to better modelling and understanding of optical tweezers.\nProblems that were previously difficult to model computationally can now be\nsolved using a variety of methods on modern systems. These advances in\ncomputational power allow for full field solutions to be visualised, leading to\nincreased understanding of the fields and behaviour in various scenarios. In\nthis paper we describe the operation of optical tweezers using full field\nsimulations calculated using the finite difference time domain method. We use\nthese simulations to visually illustrate various situations relevant to optical\ntweezers, from the basic operation of optical tweezers, to engineered particles\nand evanescent fields.\n", "  Accumulated precipitation forecasts are of high socioeconomic importance for\nagriculturally dominated societies in northern tropical Africa. In this study,\nwe analyze the performance of nine operational global ensemble prediction\nsystems (EPSs) relative to climatology-based forecasts for 1 to 5-day\naccumulated precipitation based on the monsoon seasons 2007-2014 for three\nregions within northern tropical Africa. To assess the full potential of raw\nensemble forecasts across spatial scales, we apply state-of-the-art statistical\npostprocessing methods in form of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Ensemble\nModel Output Statistics (EMOS), and verify against station and spatially\naggregated, satellite-based gridded observations. Raw ensemble forecasts are\nuncalibrated, unreliable, and underperform relative to climatology,\nindependently of region, accumulation time, monsoon season, and ensemble.\nDifferences between raw ensemble and climatological forecasts are large, and\npartly stem from poor prediction for low precipitation amounts. BMA and EMOS\npostprocessed forecasts are calibrated, reliable, and strongly improve on the\nraw ensembles, but - somewhat disappointingly - typically do not outperform\nclimatology. Most EPSs exhibit slight improvements over the period 2007-2014,\nbut overall have little added value compared to climatology. We suspect that\nthe parametrization of convection is a potential cause for the sobering lack of\nensemble forecast skill in a region dominated by mesoscale convective systems.\n", "  The symmetry energy characterizes the isospin dependent part of the equation\nof state of isospin asymmetric strong interaction matter and it plays a\ncritical role in many issues of nuclear physics and astrophysics. In this talk,\nwe briefly review the current status on the determination of the symmetry\nenergy in nucleon (nuclear) and quark matter. For nuclear matter, while the\nsubsaturation density behaviors of the symmetry energy are relatively\nwell-determined and significant progress has been made on the symmetry energy\naround saturation density, the determination of the suprasaturation density\nbehaviors of the symmetry energy remains a big challenge. For quark matter,\nwhich is expected to appear in dense matter at high baryon densities, we\nbriefly review the recent work about the effects of quark matter symmetry\nenergy on the properties of quark stars and the implication of possible\nexistence of heavy quark stars on quark matter symmetry energy. The results\nindicate that the $u$ and $d$ quarks could feel very different interactions in\nisospin asymmetric quark matter, which may have important implications on the\nisospin effects of partonic dynamics in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  We have studied the temperature dependence of conductivity, $\\sigma(T)$, in\ntwo series of Ag$_{x}$(SnO$_2$)$_{1-x}$ and Mo$_{x}$(SnO$_2$)$_{1-x}$ granular\nfilms lying below the percolation threshold, where $x$ is the metal volume\nfraction. The metal grains in the former series have approximately spherical\nshape, whereas in the latter series contain numerous small substructures. In\nboth series of films, we have observed the $\\sigma \\propto \\exp[-(T_0/T)^m]$\ntemperature dependence, with $m\\,\\simeq\\,1/2$, over the wide $T$ range from 2\nto 80 (100) K, where $T_0$ is a characteristic temperature. Our $\\sigma$($T$)\nresults are explained in term of the Abeles-Sheng model which considers the\nstructural effect of metal grains. The extracted values of the optimal\nseparation between grains ($s_{m}$) and the charging energy ($E_{c}$) slightly\nincrease with decreasing $x$. The variation of the parameter $C(x)$, defined in\nthe Abeles-Sheng model, is in consistency with a simplified expression which\ndepends only on $x$ and the dielectric constant of the insulating matrix. As\nthe temperature is increased to above $\\sim$\\,100 K, a crossover to the\nthermally fluctuation-induced tunneling conduction processes is observed.\n", "  We give numerical estimates of various unstable stationary solutions of the\nGross--Pitaevskii equation in an axially symmetric set up with a linear\ntrapping potential along the symmetry axis, and a quadratic trapping along the\nradial direction. These represent topological coherent modes of Bose--Einstein\ncondensates in a gravito optical surface trap (GOST). Despite their\ninstability, we find that many of these solutions decay sufficiently slow, so\nthat they could be realized experimentally.\n", "  The energy dispersion of fermions or bosons vanishes in momentum space if\ndestructive quantum interference occurs in a frustrated Kagome lattice with\nonly nearest-neighbour (NN) hopping. A discrete flat band (FB) without any\ndispersion is consequently formed, promising emergence of fractional quantum\nHall states (FQHS) at high temperatures. Here, we report experimental\nrealization of a FB with possible nontrivial topology in an electronic Kagome\nlattice on a twisted multilayer silicene. The electrons are localized in the\nKagome lattice due to quantum destructive interference, and thus, their kinetic\nenergy is quenched, which gives rise to a FB peak in density of states. A\nrobust and pronounced one-dimensional edge state has been revealed at Kagome\nedge, which resides at higher energy than the FB. Our observations of the FB\nand the exotic edge state in electronic Kagome lattice open up the possibility\ntowards the realization of fractional Chern insulators in two-dimensional\nmaterials.\n", "  As part of ongoing investigations into student learning in advanced\nundergraduate courses, we have developed a conceptual assessment tool for\nupper-division electrodynamics (E&M II): the Colorado UppeR-division\nElectrodyNamics Test (CURrENT). This is a free response, post-instruction\ndiagnostic with 6 multi-part questions, an optional 3-question pre-instruction\ntest, and accompanying grading rubrics. The instrument's development was guided\nby faculty-consensus learning goals and research into common student\ndifficulties. It can be used to gauge the effectiveness of transformed\npedagogy, and to gain insights into student thinking in the covered topic\nareas. We present baseline data representing 500 students across 9\ninstitutions, along with validity, reliability and discrimination measures of\nthe instrument and scoring rubric.\n", "  Comment on the article by S. Gandolfi et al. Phys.Rev.Letters 118 (2017),\n232501; arXiv:1612.01502 [nucl-th]\n", "  I derived the size dependence of distribution function for classic, boson,\nand fermion assemblies. I did not use the Stirling approximation so that\ndeviation contributed by this approximation at small number of particles can be\navoided. I identified that the size dependence of the distribution function is\ncontained in the fermi energy or chemical potential. My results seem to match\nfew reports on the dependence of fermi energy or chemical potential on particle\nsize of several nanometer sized materials\n", "  The electronic transport properties of a point-contact system formed by a\nsingle Co atom adsorbed on Cu (100) and contacted by a copper tip is evaluated\nin the presence of intra-atomic Coulomb interactions and spin-orbit coupling.\nThe calculations are performed using equilibrium Green's functions evaluated\nwithin density functional theory completed with a Hubbard $U$ term and\nspin-orbit interaction, as implemented in the Gollum package. We show that the\ncontribution to the transmission between electrodes of spin-flip components is\nnegative and scaling as $\\lambda^2/\\Gamma^2$ where $\\lambda$ is the SOC and\n$\\Gamma$ the Co atom-electrode coupling. Hence, due to this unfavorable ratio,\nSOC effects in transport in this system are small. However, we show that the\nspin-flip transmission component can increase by two orders of magnitude\ndepending on the value of the Hubbard $U$ term. These effects are particularly\nimportant in the contact regime because of the prevalence of $d$-electron\ntransport, while in the tunneling regime, transport is controlled by the\n$sp$-electron transmission and results are less dependent on the values of $U$\nand SOC. Using our electronic structure and the elastic transmission\ncalculations, we discuss the effect of $U$ and SOC on the well-known Kondo\neffect of this system.\n", "  A class of methods for measuring time delays between astronomical time series\nis introduced in the context of quasar reverberation mapping, which is based on\nmeasures of randomness or complexity of the data. Several distinct statistical\nestimators are considered that do not rely on polynomial interpolations of the\nlight curves nor on their stochastic modeling, and do not require binning in\ncorrelation space. Methods based on von Neumann's mean-square\nsuccessive-difference estimator are found to be superior to those using other\nestimators. An optimized von Neumann scheme is formulated, which better handles\nsparsely sampled data and outperforms current implementations of discrete\ncorrelation function methods. This scheme is applied to existing reverberation\ndata of varying quality, and consistency with previously reported time delays\nis found. In particular, the size-luminosity relation of the broad-line region\nin quasars is recovered with a scatter comparable to that obtained by other\nworks, yet with fewer assumptions made concerning the process underlying the\nvariability. The proposed method for time-lag determination is particularly\nrelevant for irregularly sampled time series, and in cases where the process\nunderlying the variability cannot be adequately modeled.\n", "  We investigate the influence of viscoelastic nature of the adhesive on the\nintermittent peel front dynamics by extending a recently introduced model for\npeeling of an adhesive tape. As time and rate-dependent deformation of the\nadhesives are measured in stationary conditions, a crucial step in\nincorporating the viscoelastic effects applicable to unstable intermittent peel\ndynamics is the introduction of a dynamization scheme that eliminates the\nexplicit time dependence in terms of dynamical variables. We find contrasting\ninfluences of viscoelastic contribution in different regions of tape mass,\nroller inertia, and pull velocity. As the model acoustic energy dissipated\ndepends on the nature of the peel front and its dynamical evolution, the\ncombined effect of the roller inertia and pull velocity makes the acoustic\nenergy noisier for small tape mass and low-pull velocity while it is burstlike\nfor low-tape mass, intermediate values of the roller inertia and high-pull\nvelocity. The changes are quantified by calculating the largest Lyapunov\nexponent and analyzing the statistical distributions of the amplitudes and\ndurations of the model acoustic energy signals. Both single and two stage\npower-law distributions are observed. Scaling relations between the exponents\nare derived which show that the exponents corresponding to large values of\nevent sizes and durations are completely determined by those for small values.\nThe scaling relations are found to be satisfied in all cases studied.\nInterestingly, we find only five types of model acoustic emission signals among\nmultitude of possibilities of the peel front configurations.\n", "  Starting from Anosov chaotic dynamics of geodesic flow on a surface of\nnegative curvature, we develop and consider a number of self-oscillatory\nsystems including those with hinged mechanical coupling of three rotators and a\nsystem of rotators interacting through a potential function. These results are\nused to design an electronic circuit for generation of rough (structurally\nstable) chaos. Results of numerical integration of the model equations of\ndifferent degree of accuracy are presented and discussed. Also, circuit\nsimulation of the electronic generator is provided using the NI Multisim\nenvironment. Portraits of attractors, waveforms of generated oscillations,\nLyapunov exponents, and spectra are considered and found to be in good\ncorrespondence for the dynamics on the attractive sets of the self-oscillatory\nsystems and for the original Anosov geodesic flow. The hyperbolic nature of the\ndynamics is tested numerically using a criterion based on statistics of angles\nof intersection of stable and unstable subspaces of the perturbation vectors at\na reference phase trajectory on the attractor.\n", "  We evaluate the linearity of three electric measurement techniques of the\ninitial electron density in laser filaments by comparing their results for a\npair of filaments and for the sum of each individual filament. The conductivity\nmeasured between two plane electrodes in a longitudinal configuration is linear\nwithin 2% provided the electric field is kept below 100 kV/m. Furthermore,\nsimulations show that the signal behaves like the amount of generated free\nelectrons. The slow ionic current measured with plane electrodes in a parallel\nconfiguration is representative of the ionic charge available in the filament,\nafter several $\\mu$s, when the free electrons have recombined. It is linear\nwithin 2% with the amount of ions and is insensitive to misalignment. Finally,\nthe fast polarization signal in the same configuration deviates from linearity\nby up to 80% and can only be considered as a semi-qualitative indication of the\npresence of charges, e.g., to characterize the filament length.\n", "  Here we present an experimental observation of the self-organization effect\nof the polystyrene particles formed by acoustically-induced interaction forces.\nTwo types of stable configurations are observed experimentally: one is\nmechanically equilibrium and featured by nonzero inter-particle separations,\nand the other corresponds to a close-packed assembly, which is formed by strong\nattractions among the aggregated particles. For the former case involving two\nor three particles, the most probable inter-particle separations (counted for\nnumerous independent initial arrangements) agree well with the theoretical\npredictions. For the latter case, the number of the final stable configurations\ngrows with the particle number, and the occurrence probability of each\nconfiguration is interpreted by a simple geometric model.\n", "  In this work we show how the composition of maps allows us to multiply,\nenlarge and move stable domains in phase and parameter spaces of discrete\nnonlinear systems. Using H\\'enon maps with distinct parameters we generate many\nidentical copies of isoperiodic stable structures (ISSs) in the parameter space\nand attractors in phase space. The equivalence of the identical ISSs is checked\nby the largest Lyapunov exponent analysis and the multiplied basins of\nattraction become riddled. Our proliferation procedure should be applicable to\nany two-dimensional nonlinear system.\n", "  On demand single photon emitters (SPEs) play a key role across a broad range\nof quantum technologies, including quantum computation, quantum simulation,\nquantum metrology and quantum communications. In quantum networks and quantum\nkey distribution protocols, where photons are employed as flying qubits,\ntelecom wavelength operation is preferred due to the reduced fibre loss.\nHowever, despite the tremendous efforts to develop various triggered SPE\nplatforms, a robust source of triggered SPEs operating at room temperature and\nthe telecom wavelength is still missing. Here we report a triggered, optically\nstable, room temperature solid state SPE operating at telecom wavelengths. The\nemitters exhibit high photon purity (~ 5% multiphoton events) and a record-high\nbrightness of ~ 1.5 MHz. The emission is attributed to localized defects in a\ngallium nitride (GaN) crystal. The high performance SPEs embedded in a\ntechnologically mature semiconductor are promising for on-chip quantum\nsimulators and practical quantum communication technologies.\n", "  We present results for the first three years of OzDES, a six-year programme\nto obtain redshifts for objects in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) supernova\nfields using the 2dF fibre positioner and AAOmega spectrograph on the\nAnglo-Australian Telescope. OzDES is a multi-object spectroscopic survey\ntargeting multiple types of targets at multiple epochs over a multi-year\nbaseline, and is one of the first multi-object spectroscopic surveys to\ndynamically include transients into the target list soon after their discovery.\nAt the end of three years, OzDES has spectroscopically confirmed almost 100\nsupernovae, and has measured redshifts for 17,000 objects, including the\nredshifts of 2,566 supernova hosts. We examine how our ability to measure\nredshifts for targets of various types depends on signal-to-noise, magnitude,\nand exposure time, finding that our redshift success rate increases\nsignificantly at a signal-to-noise of 2 to 3 per 1-Angstrom bin. We also find\nthat the change in signal-to-noise with exposure time closely matches the\nPoisson limit for stacked exposures as long as 10 hours. We use these results\nto predict the redshift yield of the full OzDES survey, as well as the\npotential yields of future surveys on other facilities such as the 4m\nMulti-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST), the Subaru Prime Focus\nSpectrograph (PFS), and the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE). This work\nmarks the first OzDES data release, comprising 14,693 redshifts. OzDES is on\ntarget to obtain over a yield of approximately 5,700 supernova host-galaxy\nredshifts.\n", "  The existence of a supernumerary nuclear rainbow in inelastic scattering is\nreported. This is done by studying inelastic $^{16}$O scattering from $^{12}$C,\nexciting the $2^+$ (4.44 MeV) state of $^{12}$C and elastic scattering at the\nincident energies in the range 124 to 200 MeV, using the coupled channels\nmethod. An extended double folding potential is used. This is derived from\nrealistic wave functions for $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O calculated with a\nmicroscopic $\\alpha$ cluster model and a finite-range density-dependent\nnucleon-nucleon force. Excitations to the $2^+$ (4.44 MeV), 3$^-$ (9.64 MeV)\nand $4^+$ (14.08 MeV) states of $^{12}$C, and the $3^-$ (6.13 MeV) and $2^+$\n(6.92 MeV) states of $^{16}$O are included in the coupled channels\ncalculations. The emergence of the supernumerary bow is understood by the\nproperties of both the Luneburg-lens-like potential in the internal region and\ndiffuse attraction in the outer region. The existence of a supernumerary\nrainbow for inelastic scattering in addition to the existence of a dynamically\ncreated secondary rainbow and a dynamically refracted primary rainbow for\nelastic scattering, which are not observed in meteorological rainbows, further\ndeepens the understanding of nuclear rainbows.\n", "  A model for the mass in and around the Local Group previously used to fit\nredshifts of dwarf galaxies to their distances between 50 kpc and 2.6 Mpc under\nthe condition of small and growing primeval departures from homogeneity is\nshown to allow fits to distances and redshifts of twelve galactic globular\nclusters at galactocentric distances greater than 30 kpc. The solutions also\nfit three sets of measured globular cluster proper motions and the orientation\nof one observation of tidal tails. In some solutions these outer globular\nclusters have circled the Milky Way several times, losing information about\ntheir initial conditions. In other trajectories globular clusters are\napproaching the Milky Way for the first time from formation in mass\nconcentrations modest enough to have small internal velocities and initially\nmoving away from the proto--Milky Way galaxy at close to the general rate of\nexpansion of the universe.\n", "  An important question for the practical applicability of the highly efficient\ntraffic intersection control is about the minimal level of intelligence the\nvehicles need to have so as to move beyond the traffic light control. We\npropose an efficient intersection traffic control scheme without the traffic\nlights, that only requires a majority of vehicles on the road to be equipped\nwith a simple driver assistance system. The algorithm of our scheme is\ncompletely decentralized, and takes into full account the non-linear\ninteraction between the vehicles at high density. For vehicles approaching the\nintersection in different directions, our algorithm imposes simple interactions\nbetween vehicles around the intersection, by defining specific conditions on\nthe real-time basis, for which the involved vehicles are required to briefly\nadjust their dynamics. This leads to a self-organised traffic flow that is\nsafe, robust, and efficient. We also take into account of the driver comfort\nlevel and study its effect on the control efficiency. The scheme has low\ntechnological barrier, minimal impact on the conventional driving behaviour,\nand can coexist with the traffic light control. It also has the advantages of\nbeing easily scalable, and fully compatible with both the conventional road\nsystems as well as the futuristic scenario in which driverless vehicles\ndominate the road. The mathematical formulation of our scheme permits large\nscale realistic numerical simulations of busy intersections, allowing a more\ncomplete evaluation of the control performance, instead of just the collision\navoidance at the intersection.\n", "  Transmission electron microscopy specimens typically exhibit local distortion\nat thin foil edges, which can influence the absorption of X-rays for\nquantitative energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Here, we report a\nnumerical, three-dimensional approach to model the geometry of general\nspecimens and its influence on quantification when using single and multiple\ndetector configurations. As a function of specimen tilt, we show that the model\ncorrectly predicts the asymmetric nature of X-ray counts and ratios. When using\na single detector, we show that complex specimen geometries can introduce\nsignificant uncertainty in EDS quantification. Further, we show that this\nuncertainty can be largely negated by collection with multiple detectors placed\nsymmetrically about the sample such as the FEI Super-X. Finally, based on\nguidance provided by the model, we propose methods to reduce quantification\nerror introduced by the sample shape. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/subangstrom/superAngle.\n", "  It is customary to assume that the law of conservation of the angular\nmomentum is violated for an asymmetric energy-momentum tensors. This is the\nreason for criticizing the Minkowski tensor and other asymmetric\nenergy-momentum tensors. In this paper, it is shown that the laws of\nconservation of energy and momentum following from an asymmetric tensor in the\nform of its total divergence are equivalent to the divergence of its symmetric\npart. It is shown that the total divergence of the antisymmetric part of the\nasymmetric tensor is identically zero. From this, it follows that for the\nasymmetric energy-momentum tensor the law of conservation of the angular\nmomentum is also fulfilled. It is shown that the linear invariant of the\nMinkowski tensor for a vacuum does not correspond to the quadratic invariant of\nthe electromagnetic field. This indicates that the linear invariant of the\nMinkowski tensor and the three-dimensional stress tensor are not correct.\n", "  We use the Global Historical Climatology Network--daily database to calculate\na nonparametric statistic that describes the rate at which all-time daily high\nand low temperature records have been set in nine geographic regions\n(continents or major portions of continents) during periods mostly from the\nmid-20th Century to the present. This statistic was defined in our earlier work\non temperature records in the 48 contiguous United States. In contrast to this\nearlier work, we find that in every region except North America all-time high\nrecords were set at a rate significantly (at least $3\\sigma$) higher than in\nthe null hypothesis of a stationary climate. Except in Antarctica, all-time low\nrecords were set at a rate significantly lower than in the null hypothesis. In\nEurope, North Africa and North Asia the rate of setting new all-time highs\nincreased suddenly in the 1990's, suggesting a change in regional climate\nregime; in most other regions there was a steadier increase.\n", "  It is an old idea to realize Einstein's equations as a thermodynamical\nequation of state. Since then, there has been new conjectures to understand\ngravity from another point of view. In this way we can accept that the\ngravitational field is not an underlying one like an emergent force from other\napproaches based on the knowledge of relativity, quantum and black holes\nthermodynamics, and different statistical formalisms. One important question\nconcerning this gravity/thermostatistics correspondence is whether the\nholographic screen could be well defined for a nonrelativistic case of a source\nmass. Hence, to understand the actual role of the holographic screen is a very\nrelevant issue. In this letter we have analyzed the entropy as a function of\nthe holographic screen in some different scenarios. We have disclosed modified\nNewtonian dynamics (MOND) from Verlinde's ideas. Besides, we have calculated\nsome cosmological elements using the same ideas. The results obtained using\nMOND will guide us to obtain other cosmological results.\n", "  We report preliminary studies of a three-channel, rectangular, high gradient\ndielectric wakefield accelerator element, which, unlike the collinear\ncylindrical dielectric wakefield device, does not suffer from low transformer\nratio and may offer relief from the beam breakup instability. When configured\nas a resonator (DWR), it can be driven by a series of modest-charge drive\nbunches. This rectangular 'mode-locked' resonator consists of three channels\nlined with low-loss dielectric slabs: the central wider channel is the drive\nbunch channel, whereas two adjacent narrow channels are used to accelerate\nelectron and/or positron bunches; this provides a favorable transformer ratio.\nAt the moment when, after reflecting from the resonator exit, the wakefield\nreturns to the resonator entrance, the next bunch is injected into the\nresonator entrance. The length of the resonator is also chosen to be a multiple\nof half the desired wakefield wavelength. The rectangular geometry permits\nsuperposition of harmonics of wakefields in the resonator. The short length of\nthe device and its planar configuration should allow management of beam\nbreakup, and a lengthy drive bunch train can be dynamically stabilized by using\na series of DWR units rotated about the $z$-axis in $90^{\\circ}$ increments.\n", "  We prove an existence theorem for positive solutions to Lichnerowicz-type\nequations on complete manifolds with boundary and nonlinear Neumann conditions.\nThis kind of nonlinear problems arise quite naturally in the study of solutions\nfor the Einstein-scalar field equations of General Relativity in the framework\nof the so called Conformal Method.\n", "  Bose-Einstein condensation has been achieved in a magnetic surface micro trap\nwith 4x10^5 87Rb atoms. The strongly anisotropic trapping potential is\ngenerated by a microstructure which consists of microfabricated linear copper\nconductors at a width ranging from 3 to 30 micrometer. After loading a high\nnumber of atoms from a pulsed thermal source directly into a magneto-optical\ntrap (MOT) the magnetically stored atoms are transferred into the micro trap by\nadiabatic transformation of the trapping potential. The complete in vacuo trap\ndesign is compatible with ultrahigh vacuum below 2x10^(-11) mbar.\n", "  The algebraic Bethe ansatz can be performed rather abstractly for whole\nclasses of models sharing the same $R$-matrix, the only prerequisite being the\nexistence of an appropriate pseudo vacuum state. Here we perform the algebraic\nBethe ansatz for all models with $9 \\times 9$, rational, gl(1$|$2)-invariant\n$R$-matrix and all three possibilities of choosing the grading. Our Bethe\nansatz solution applies, for instance, to the supersymmetric t-J model, the\nsupersymmetric $U$ model and a number of interesting impurity models. It may be\nextended to obtain the quantum transfer matrix spectrum for this class of\nmodels. The properties of a specific model enter the Bethe ansatz solution\n(i.e. the expression for the transfer matrix eigenvalue and the Bethe ansatz\nequations) through the three pseudo vacuum eigenvalues of the diagonal elements\nof the monodromy matrix which in this context are called the parameters of the\nmodel.\n", "  The three different sets of Bethe ansatz equations describing the Bethe\nansatz solution of the supersymmetric t-J model are known to be equivalent.\nHere we give a new, simplified proof of this fact which relies on the\nproperties of certain polynomials. We also show that the corresponding transfer\nmatrix eigenvalues agree.\n", "  We present an integral formula for a special correlation function of the\nisotropic spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain. The correlation function\ndescribes the probability for the occurrence of a string of consecutive\nup-spins as a function of temperature, magnetic field and length of the string.\n", "  A search for a non-random co-variation between the Neutrino Flux and Mental\nActivity was undertaken, using the 5-day period version of the SK-I data taken\nfrom May 31st, 1996 to July 15th, 2001. For the whole 1996-2001 period, a\nsignificant correlation between the Neutrino Flux and Mental Activity was found\nfor each of the two midnight hours, i.e. for each of the two hours between\n23:00-1:00. A significant correlation was also found across all hours for the\nwhole year of 1998. It is not clear why this particular year should have been\ndifferent from the other calendar years of 1996-2001. More specifically,\nsignificant correlations were also found for each of its hours around noon,\ni.e. for each of the hours between 10:00-16:00, for the year of 1998. An\nattempt was made to interpret why significant correlations were found only for\nmidnight hours and hours around noon, but not for any other hours: when the\nsun-earth axis and the staff-detector axis coincided, the likelihood increased\nthat staff neutrinos (if any) were counted - as solar neutrinos. Unruh's second\nquantization in the Kerr metric was suggested as an example of theoretical\nsupport for this conjecture that Mental Activity is a quantum-gravitational\nprocess which influences the Neutrino Flux.\n"]}
