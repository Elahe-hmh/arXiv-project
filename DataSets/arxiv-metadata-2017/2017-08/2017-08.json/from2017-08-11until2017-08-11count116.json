In the context of normal cosmology, under the\nordinary assumptions of positive mass-energy and initial negative pressure, we\nfind the initial singularity of the universe is certainly absent and we have\n$K=1$. This means total spatial structure of the universe should be a\n3-dimensional sphere $S^3$. For the cyclic cosmological model, we have\n$\\Lambda\\lesssim 10^{-24} {\\rm ly}^{-2}$. Obviously, such constraints would be\nhelpful for the researches on the properties of dark matter and dark energy in\ncosmology.\n", "  We define infinitesimal contact transformations for ordinary difference\nschemes as transformations that depend on $K+1$ lattice points $(K \\geq 1)$ and\ncan be integrated to form a local or global Lie group. We then prove that such\ncontact transformations do not exist.\n", "  Higgs, inflaton and axion physics are examples where scalar fields naturally\nappear, in the two former cases, usually with a polynomial type\nself-interaction. In this work possible applications of periodic scalar\npotentials are discussed which belong to the sine-Gordon universality class.\nFor example, a periodic self-interaction is proposed here as a possible\nextension, UV completion of the standard model Higgs potential. Using the usual\nparametrisation of the field around the first minimum, one recovers the\nLagrangian of the Higgs sector but with a periodic interaction term for a\nsingle-component real scalar field. Another possible application is\ninflationary cosmology where the so called natural inflation i.e., the periodic\nPNGB potential has already been used as a competing inflationary model.\nFinally, one has to mention the periodic axion potential which was proposed to\nretain the CP conserving nature of QCD where, in principle, gauge symmetry and\nrenormalizability allow the inclusion of CP violating terms but experimental\ndata do not favour such an extension. The purpose of this work is to map out\nthe exact phase structure of the sine-Gordon model by the functional\nrenormalization group (RG) method in arbitrary dimension and to study the\nconsequences of its renormalization on Higgs, inflaton and axion physics. It is\nshown that the pure sine-Gordon model has a single (broken) phase for d>2.\nResults are used to study the phase structure of the equivalent neutral Coulomb\ngas and to demonstrate that the isotropic XY spin model belongs to a different\nuniversality class for d>2. The findings (i) open a new platform to perform\nstability studies for models with periodic type Higgs potential which can be\nused as a possible UV completion, (ii) clarify the role of the RG running of\nthe frequency parameter in the PNGB inflationary model, (iii) confirm the\nflattening of the axion potential.\n", "  Interaction of charged leptons with photons is considered for the case when\none of the lepton legs is off the mass shell. The effect due to off-mass-shell\nshift in the anomalous magnetic moment is computed within one-loop\napproximation. Possible contributions of this effect in the muon $g-2$\nmeasurements are discussed.\n", "  Perhaps the most iconic feature of melting Arctic sea ice is the formation of\ndistinctive, complex ponds on its surface during late spring. The evolution of\nmelt ponds and their geometrical characteristics determines the albedo of sea\nice, a key parameter in climate modeling. However, a theoretical understanding\nof this evolution, and predictions of geometrical features, have remained\nelusive. To address this fundamental problem in polar climate science, here we\nintroduce a two dimensional random field Ising model for melt ponds. The ponds\nare identified as metastable states of the system, where the binary spin\nvariable corresponds to the presence of melt water or ice on the sea ice\nsurface. With only a minimal set of physical parameters, the model predictions\nagree very closely with observed power law scaling of the pond size\ndistribution and critical length scale where melt ponds undergo a transition in\nfractal geometry.\n", "  We propose a simple technique to generate entanglement between distant\ncavities by using entanglement swapping involving atomic momenta. For the\nproposed scheme, we have two identical atoms, both initially in their ground\nstate, each incident on far apart cavities with particular initial momenta. The\ntwo cavities are prepared initially in superposition of zero and one photon\nstate. First, we interact each atom with a cavity in dispersive way. The\ninteraction results into atom-field entangled state. Then we perform EPR state\nmeasurement on both atomic momenta state which is an analog of Bell\nmeasurement. The EPR state measurement is designed by passing the atoms through\ncavity beam splitters which transfers the atomic momentum state into\nsuperposition state. Finally, these atoms are detected by the detector. After\nthe detection of the atoms, we can distinguish that cavities in one of the Bell\nstates. This process leads to two distant cavity fields entanglement.\n", "  A systematic and unified approach to transformations and symmetries of\ngeneral second order linear parabolic partial differential equations is\npresented. Equivalence group is used to derive the Appell type transformations,\nspecifically Mehler's kernel in any dimension. The complete symmetry group\nclassification is re-performed. A new criterion which is necessary and\nsufficient for reduction to the standard heat equation by point transformations\nis established. A similar criterion is also valid for the equations to have a\nfour- or six-dimensional symmetry group (nontrivial symmetry groups). In this\nsituation, the basis elements are listed in terms of coefficients. A number of\nillustrative examples are given. In particular, some applications from the\nrecent literature are re-examined in our new approach. Applications include a\ncomparative discussion of heat kernels based on group-invariant solutions and\nthe idea of connecting Lie symmetries and classical integral transforms\nintroduced by Craddock and his coworkers. Multidimensional parabolic PDEs of\nheat and Schr\\\"odinger type are also considered.\n", "  We present a simple observation about soft amplitudes and soft functions\nappearing in factorizable cross sections in $ee$, $ep$, and $pp$ collisions\nthat has not clearly been made in previous literature, namely, that the\nhemisphere soft functions that appear in event shape distributions in\n$e^+e^-\\to$ dijets, deep inelastic scattering (DIS), and in Drell-Yan (DY)\nprocesses are equal in perturbation theory up to $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$,\neven though individual amplitudes may have opposite sign imaginary parts due to\nchanging complex pole prescriptions in eikonal propagators for incoming vs.\noutgoing lines. We also explore potential generalizations of this observation\nto soft functions for other observables or with more jets in the final state.\n", "  We consider a $\\mathbb{R}$-extension of one dimensional uniformly expanding\nopen dynamical systems and prove a new explicit estimate for the asymptotic\nspectral gap. To get these results, we use a new application of a \"global\nnormal form\" for the dynamical system, a \"semiclassical expression beyond the\nEhrenfest time\" that expresses the transfer operator at large time as a sum\nover rank one operators (each is associated to one orbit). In this paper we\nestablish the validity of the so-called \"diagonal approximation\" up to twice\nthe local Ehrenfest time.\n", "  Spin Hall Effect is relativistic quantum mechanical effect which enables\nnon-magnetic materials show magnetic phenomena without the application of a\nmagnetic field. With spin Hall Effect, one can realize spintronics devices\noperating purely on electrical and optical means and eliminate the use of\nferromagnets which have associated fringe fields. In this review article, we\npresent the experimental developments and current understanding of the Spin\nHall Effect Phenomena. We discuss various experiments as well as device\nstructures which employ electrical, optical or both techniques to demonstrate\nSpin Hall effect. Most of these devices structures are simple and easy to\nfabricate in modern laboratories.\n", "  The temperature and magnetic field dependences of the anomalous Hall effect\n(AHE) are studied in Mn delta-doped semiconductor heterostructures with a\ntwo-dimensional hole gas in a quantum well interacting with the Mn layer. The\nanalysis of experimental data reveals four distinct temperature ranges\ndiffering in the behavior of AHE. The Mn layer induces an inhomogeneity of the\nhole gas leading to an interplay between the hopping and drift conductivities.\nIt is shown that at sufficiently low temperatures, hopping conductivity favors\nthe mechanisms of AHE related to the geometric (Berry-Pancharatnam) phase.\n", "  QED radiative corrections to elastic electron-proton scattering at low\nenergies are discussed. Corrections to the electron line and effects due to\nvacuum polarization are computed. Higher order effects are estimated for the\nconditions of the experiment on the electric and magnetic proton form factors\nby A1 Collaboration. Calculations are performed within the next-to-leading\napproximation. Inclusion of the higher order effects can affect the value of\nthe proton charge radius extracted from the experimental data.\n", "  Von Neumann's procedure is applied for quantization of General Relativity. We\nquantize the initial data of dynamical variables at the Planck epoch, where the\nHubble parameter coincides with the Planck mass. These initial data are defined\nvia the Fock simplex in the tangent Minkowskian space-time and the Dirac\nconformal interval. The Einstein cosmological principle is applied for the\naverage of the spatial metric determinant logarithm over the spatial volume of\nthe visible Universe. We derive the splitting of the general coordinate\ntransformations into the diffeomorphisms (as the object of the second N\\\"other\ntheorem) and the initial data transformations (as objects of the first N\\\"other\ntheorem). Following von Neumann, we suppose that the vacuum state is a quantum\nensemble. The vacuum state is degenerated with respect to quantum numbers of\nnon-vacuum states with the distribution function that yields the Casimir effect\nin gravidynamics in analogy to the one in electrodynamics. The generation\nfunctional of the perturbation theory in gravidynamics is given as a solution\nof the quantum energy constraint. We discuss the region of applicability of\ngravidynamics and its possible predictions for explanation of the modern\nobservational and experimental data.\n", "  The current proposals for producing non-Abelian anyons and Majorana\nparticles, which are neither fermions nor bosons, are primarily based on the\nrealization of topological superconductivity in two dimensions. We show\ntheoretically that the unique Landau level structure of bilayer graphene\nprovides a new possible avenue for achieving such exotic particles.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate the feasibility of a \"parton\" fractional quantum\nHall (FQH) state, which supports non-Abelian particles without the usual\ntopological superconductivity. Furthermore, we advance this state as the\nfundamental explanation of the puzzling $1/2$ FQH effect observed in bilayer\ngraphene [Kim {\\em et al.}, Nano Lett. {\\bf 15}, 7445 (2015)], and predict that\nit will also occur in trilayer graphene. We indicate experimental signatures\nthat differentiate the parton state from other candidate non-Abelian FQH states\nand predict that a transverse electric field can induce a topological quantum\nphase transition between two distinct non-Abelian FQH states.\n", "  The nature of emergent collective behaviors of moving physical agents\ninteracting with their neighborhood is a long-standing open issue in physical\nand biological systems alike. This calls for studies on the control of\nsynchronization and the degree of order in a collection of diffusively moving\nnoisy oscillators. We address this by constructing a generic hydrodynamic\ntheory for active phase fluctuations in a collection of large number of nearly\nphase-coherent moving oscillators in two dimensions. Our theory describes the\ngeneral situation where phase fluctuations and oscillator mobility mutually\naffect each other. We show that the interplay between the active effects and\nthe mobility of the oscillators leads to a variety of phenomena, ranging from\nsynchronization with long range, nearly long range and quasi long range orders\nto instabilities and desynchronization with short range order of the oscillator\nphases. We highlight the complex dependences of synchronization on the active\neffects. These should be testable in wide ranging systems, e.g., oscillating\nchemical reactions in the presence of different reaction\ninhibitors/facilitators, live oriented cytoskeletal extracts, or vertebrate\nsegmentation clocks.\n", "  Since the discovery of the cuprate high-temperature superconductivity in\n1986, a universal phase diagram has been constructed experimentally and\nnumerous theoretical models have been proposed. However, there remains no\nconsensus on the underlying physics thus far. Here, we theoretically\ninvestigate the phase diagram of hole-doped cuprates based on an\nitinerant-localized dual fermion model, with the charge carriers doped on the\noxygen sites and localized holes on the copper $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. We\nanalytically demonstrate that the puzzling anomalous normal state or the\nstrange metal could simply stem from a free Fermi gas of carriers bathing in\ncopper antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. The short-range high-energy spin\nexcitations also act as the `magnetic glue' of carrier Cooper pairs and induce\n$d$-wave superconductivity from the underdoped to overdoped regime, distinctly\ndiffrent from the conventional low-frequency magnetic fluctuation mechanism. We\nfurther sketch out the characteristic dome-shaped critical temperature $T_c$\nversus doping level. The emergence of the pseudogap is ascribed to the\nlocalization of partial carriers coupled to the local copper moments or a\ncrossover from the strange metal to a nodal Kondo-like insulator. Our work\nprovides a consistent theoretical framework to understand the typical phase\ndiagram of hole-doped cuprates and paves a distinct way to the studies of both\nnon-Fermi liquid and unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated\nsystems.\n", "  The quantum anomalous Hall effect, an exotic topological state first\ntheoretically predicted by Haldane and recently experimentally observed, has\nattracted enormous interest for low-power-consumption electronics. In this\nwork, we derived a Schr{\\\"o}dinger-like equation of phonons, where\ntopology-related quantities, time reversal symmetry and its breaking can be\nnaturally introduced similar as for electrons. Furthermore, we proposed a\nphononic analog of the Haldane model, which gives the novel quantum (anomalous)\nHall-like phonon states characterized by one-way gapless edge modes immune to\nscattering. The topologically nontrivial phonon states are useful not only for\nconducting phonons without dissipation but also for designing highly efficient\nphononic devices, like an ideal phonon diode, which could find important\napplications in future phononics.\n", "  Density functional theory has made great success in solid state physics,\nquantum chemistry and in computational material sciences. In this work we show\nthat density functional theory could shed light on phase transitions and\nentanglement at finite temperatures. Specifically, we show that the equilibrium\nstate of an interacting quantum many-body system which is in thermal\nequilibrium with a heat bath at a fixed temperature is a universal functional\nof the first derivatives of the free energy with respect to temperature and\nother control parameters respectively. This insight from density functional\ntheory enables us to express the average value of any physical observable and\nany entanglement measure as a universal functional of the first derivatives of\nthe free energy with respect to temperature and other control parameters. Since\nphase transitions are marked by the nonanalytic behavior of free energy with\nrespect to control parameters, the physical quantities and entanglement\nmeasures may present nonanalytic behavior at critical point inherited from\ntheir dependence on the first derivative of free energy. We use an\nexperimentally realizable model to demonstrate the idea. These results give new\ninsights for phase transitions and provide new profound connections between\nentanglement and phase transition in interacting quantum many-body physics.\n", "  We present a Randall-Sundrum toy model with an added scalar singlet that\ncouples only to KK fermions in the bulk. Such a scalar would nontrivially\naffect radion phenomenology. In addition, we examine the radion phenomenology\nin light of the new scalar and show how this scalar could present another probe\nto search for the radion.\n", "  A city is a whole, as are all cities in a country. Within a whole, individual\ncities possess different degrees of wholeness, defined by Christopher Alexander\nas a life-giving order or simply a living structure. To characterize the\nwholeness and in particular to advocate for wholeness as an effective design\nprinciple, this paper develops a geographic representation that views cities as\na whole. This geographic representation is topology-oriented, so fundamentally\ndiffers from existing geometry-based geographic representations. With the\ntopological representation, all cities are abstracted as individual points and\nput into different hierarchical levels, according to their sizes and based on\nhead/tail breaks - a classification scheme and visualization tool for data with\na heavy tailed distribution. These points of different hierarchical levels are\nrespectively used to create Thiessen polygons. Based on polygon-polygon\nrelationships, we set up a complex network. In this network, small polygons\npoint to adjacent large polygons at the same hierarchical level and contained\npolygons point to containing polygons across two consecutive hierarchical\nlevels. We computed the degrees of wholeness for individual cities, and\nsubsequently found that the degrees of wholeness possess both properties of\ndifferentiation and adaptation. To demonstrate, we developed four case studies\nof all China and UK natural cities, as well as Beijing and London natural\ncities, using massive amounts of street nodes and Tweet locations. The\ntopological representation and the kind of topological analysis in general can\nbe applied to any design or pattern, such as carpets, Baroque architecture and\nartifacts, and fractals in order to assess their beauty, echoing the\nintroductory quote from Christopher Alexander.\n  Keywords: Wholeness, natural cities, head/tail breaks, complex networks,\nscaling hierarchy, urban design\n", "  In this paper, we give a positive answer to a longstanding open problem for\ndetermining the shape of an obstacle from the knowledge of the far field\npattern for the scattering of time-harmonic elastic wave. We show that the\nelastic far field pattern by an incoming plane wave with a fixed frequency, a\nfixed incident direction and a fixed polarization determines the obstacle $D$\nand the boundary condition on $\\partial D$ uniquely. The boundary condition on\n$\\partial D$ is either the Dirichlet, or the Neumann, or the Robin one.\n", "  In this short comment, we notice that the model-independent axion\ncontribution to the graviton mass at just outside the Schwarzschild radius is\ncompletely negligible in GW150914. The model-independent axion contribution to\nthe graviton mass at the order $10^{-22}\\,$eV might be possible for merger of\nblack holes of mass of order $2\\times 10^{14}\\,$kg.\n", "  The production of quantum states required for use in quantum protocols &\ntechnologies is studied by developing the tools to re-engineer a perfect state\ntransfer spin chain so that a separable input excitation is output over\nmultiple sites. We concentrate in particular on cases where the excitation is\nsuperposed over a small subset of the qubits on the spin chain, known as\nfractional revivals, demonstrating that spin chains are capable of producing a\nfar greater range of fractional revivals than previously known, at high speed.\nWe also provide a numerical technique for generating chains that produce\narbitrary single-excitation states, such as the W state.\n", "  Presented is an unitary operator splitting method for handling the\nspin-density interaction in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. The zero\ntemperature behavior of a spinor BEC is given by mean field theory, where the\nHamiltonian includes a nonlinear hyperfine spin interaction. This hyperfine\ninteraction has a diagonal probability-density term (leading to the usual\nGross-Pitaevskii type equation of motion) but also has a nondiagonal\nspin-density term. Since the F=2 spinor BEC (spin-2 BEC) has a non-Abelian\nsuperfluid phase (nonperturbative cyclic phase in the strong spin-density\ncoupling regime), an infinite-order expansion of the quantum evolution operator\nis needed for quantum simulation applications. An infinite-order expansion,\nobtained by analytical continuation and expressed in analytically closed form,\nfor the spin-2 BEC is presented.\n", "  Nematic order is ubiquitous in liquid crystals and is characterized by a\nrotational symmetry breaking in an otherwise uniform liquid. Recently a similar\nphenomenon has been observed in some electronic phases of quantum materials\nrelated to high temperature superconductivity, particularly in the Fe-based\nsuperconductors. While several experiments have probed nematic fluctuations,\nthey have been primarily restricted to the uniform nematic susceptibility, i.e.\nq = 0 fluctuations. Here, we investigate the behavior of finite-momentum\nnematic fluctuations by measuring transverse acoustic phonon modes with\nwavelengths of up to 25 unit cells in the prototypical Fe-based compound\nBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$. While the slope of the phonon dispersion gives\ninformation about the uniform nematic susceptibility, deviations from this\nlinear behavior at finite but small wave-vectors are attributed to\nfinite-momentum nematic fluctuations. Surprisingly, these non-zero q\nfluctuations lead to a softening of the phonon mode below the superconducting\ntransition temperature, in contrast to the behavior of the phonon velocity at q\n= 0, which increases below $T_c$. Our work not only establishes a sound method\nto probe long wavelength nematic fluctuations, but also sheds light on the\nunique interplay between nematicity and superconductivity in Fe-based\ncompounds.\n", "  We show how small-signal analysis, a standard method in electrical\nengineering, may be applied to thermoelectric device performance measurement by\nextending a dc model to the dynamical regime. We thus provide a physical ground\nto \\textit{ad-hoc} models used to interpret impedance spectroscopy of\nthermoelectric elements from an electrical circuit equivalent for\nthermoelectric systems in the frequency domain. We particularly stress the\nimportance of the finite thermal impedance of the thermal contacts between the\nthermoelectric system and the thermal reservoirs in the derivation of such\nmodels. The expression for the characteristic angular frequency of the\nthermoelectric system we obtain is a generalization of the expressions derived\nin previous studies. In particular, it allows to envisage impedance\nspectroscopy measurements beyond the restrictive case of adiabatic boundary\nconditions often difficult to achieve experimentally, and hence \\emph{in-situ}\ncharacterization of thermoelectric generators.\n", "  We present a search for neutrinos in coincidence in time and direction with\nfour fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Parkes and Green Bank radio\ntelescopes during the first year of operation of the complete IceCube Neutrino\nObservatory (May 2011 through May 2012). The neutrino sample consists of\n138,322 muon neutrino candidate events, which are dominated by atmospheric\nneutrinos and muons but also contain an astrophysical neutrino component.\nConsidering only neutrinos detected on the same day as each FRB, zero IceCube\nevents were found to be compatible with the FRB directions within the estimated\n99\\% error radius of the neutrino directions. Based on the non-detection, we\npresent the first upper limits on the neutrino fluence from fast radio bursts.\n", "  We report on the optical generation and detection of ultrashort acoustic\npulses that propagate in three-dimensional semiconductor crystals.\nPhotoexcitaiton of lattice-matched GaP layers grown on Si(001) gives rise to a\nsharp spike in transient reflectivity due to the acoustic pulse generated at\nthe GaP/Si interface and detected at the GaP surface and vice versa. The\nextremely short width of the reflectivity spike, 0.5 ps, would translate to a\nspatial extent of 3 nm or 10 atomic bilayers, which is comparable with the\nwidth of the intermixing layer at the GaP/Si interface. The reflectivity\nsignals are also modified by quasi-periodic Brillouin oscillations of GaP and\nSi arising from the acoustic pulses during the propagation in the crystals. The\npresent results demonstrate the potential application of the simple optical\npump-probe scheme in the nondestructive evaluation of the buried semiconductor\ninterface quality.\n", "  We discuss the 4pt function of the critical 3d Ising model, extracted from\nrecent conformal bootstrap results. We focus on the non-gaussianity Q - the\nratio of the 4pt function to its gaussian part given by three Wick\ncontractions. This ratio reveals significant non-gaussianity of the critical\nfluctuations. The bootstrap results are consistent with a rigorous inequality\ndue to Lebowitz and Aizenman, which limits Q to lie between 1/3 and 1.\n", "  We study the attractive Fermi mixture of a\n${}^{6}\\mathrm{Li}$-${}^{40}\\mathrm{K}$ gas in one dimension using the\ncontinuous matrix product states variational ansatz and obtain the $T=0$ phase\ndiagram. We predict an axial density profile that contains four distinct phases\ntrapped induced along one-dimensional (1D) tubes, which is more intricate than\nthose observed in 1D mass-balanced systems or in higher-dimensional gas clouds.\nThe parameter regimes explored are realistic in view of possible future\nexperiments. This an application of continuous matrix product states to a\nnonintegrable fermionic system.\n", "  We construct a family of very simple stationary solutions to gravity coupled\nto a massless scalar field in global AdS. They involve a constantly rising\nsource for the scalar field at the boundary and thereby we name them pumping\nsolutions. We construct them numerically in $D=4$. They are regular and,\ngenerically, have negative mass. We perform a study of linear and nonlinear\nstability and find both stable and unstable branches. In the latter case,\nsolutions belonging to different sub-branches can either decay to black holes\nor to limiting cycles. This observation motivates the search for non-stationary\nexactly time-periodic solutions which we actually construct. We clarify the\nrole of pumping solutions in the context of quasistatic adiabatic quenches. In\n$D=3$ the pumping solutions can be related to other previously known solutions,\nlike magnetic or translationally-breaking backgrounds. From this we derive an\nanalytic expression.\n", "  Up to now, the excited charmed and bottom baryon states are still not well\nstudied both experimentally and theoretically. In the present paper, we predict\nthe mass of $\\Omega_b^*$, the only $L = 0$ baryon state which has not been\nobserved, to be 6069.2 MeV. The spectra of charmed and bottom baryons with the\norbital angular momentum $L = 1$ are studied in two popular constituent quark\nmodels, the Goldstone boson exchange (GBE) and the one gluon exchange (OGE)\nhyperfine interaction models, respectively. Inserting the latest experimental\ndata from the \"Review of Particle Physics\", we find that in the GBE model,\nthere exist some multiplets ($\\Sigma_{c(b)}$, $\\Xi'_{c(b)}$ and\n$\\Omega_{c(b)}$) which total spins of three quarks in their lowest energy\nstates are 3/2, but in the OGE model there is no such phenomenon. This is the\nmost important difference between the GBE and OGE models. These results can be\ntested in the near future. We suggest more efforts to study the excited charmed\nand bottom baryons both theoretically and experimentally, not only for the\nabundance of baryon spectra, but also for determining which hyperfine\ninteraction model is realized in nature.\n", "  We propose a new table-top experimental configuration for the direct\ndetection of dark matter axions with mass in the $(10^{-6} \\rm eV - 10^{-2} \\rm\neV)$ range using non-perturbative effects in a system with non-trivial spatial\ntopology. Different from most experimental setups found in literature on direct\ndark matter axion detection, which relies on $\\dot{\\theta}$ or\n$\\vec{\\nabla}\\theta$, we found that our system is in principle sensitive to a\nstatic $\\theta\\geq 10^{-14}$ and can also be used to set limit on the\nfundamental constant $\\theta_{\\rm QED}$ which becomes the fundamental\nobservable parameter of the Maxwell system if some conditions are met.\nConnection with Witten effect when the induced electric charge $e'$ is\nproportional to $\\theta$ and the magnetic monopole becomes the dyon with\nnon-vanishing $e'=-e \\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi}$ is also discussed.\n", "  In the spirit of the thin-layer quantization approach, we give the formula of\nthe geometric influences of a particle confined to a curved surface embedded in\nthree-dimensional Euclidean space. The geometric contributions can result from\nthe reduced commutation relation between the acted function depending on normal\nvariable and the normal derivative. According to the formula, we obtain the\ngeometric potential, geometric momentum, geometric orbital angular momentum,\ngeometric linear Rashba and cubic Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. As an\nexample, a truncated cone surface is considered. We find that the geometric\norbital angular momentum can provide an azimuthal polarization for spin, and\nthe sign of the geometric Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling can be flipped\nthrough the inclination angle of generatrix.\n", "  Simple aerodynamic configurations under even modest conditions can exhibit\ncomplex flows with a wide range of temporal and spatial features. It has become\ncommon practice in the analysis of these flows to look for and extract\nphysically important features, or modes, as a first step in the analysis. This\nstep typically starts with a modal decomposition of an experimental or\nnumerical dataset of the flow field, or of an operator relevant to the system.\nWe describe herein some of the dominant techniques for accomplishing these\nmodal decompositions and analyses that have seen a surge of activity in recent\ndecades. For a non-expert, keeping track of recent developments can be\ndaunting, and the intent of this document is to provide an introduction to\nmodal analysis that is accessible to the larger fluid dynamics community. In\nparticular, we present a brief overview of several of the well-established\ntechniques and clearly lay the framework of these methods using familiar linear\nalgebra. The modal analysis techniques covered in this paper include the proper\northogonal decomposition (POD), balanced proper orthogonal decomposition\n(Balanced POD), dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), Koopman analysis, global\nlinear stability analysis, and resolvent analysis.\n", "  The ISS-based CALET (CALorimetric Electron Telescope) detector can play an\nimportant role in indirect search for Dark Matter (DM), measuring the\nelectron+positron flux in the TeV region for the first time directly. With its\nfine energy resolution of approximately $2\\%$ and good proton rejection ratio\n($1:10^5$) it has the potential to search for fine structures in the Cosmic Ray\n(CR) electron spectrum. In this context we discuss the ability of CALET to\ndiscern between signals originating from astrophysical sources and DM decay or\nannihilation. We fit a parametrization of the local interstellar electron and\npositron spectra to current measurements, with either a pulsar or 3-body decay\nof fermionic DM as the extra source causing the positron excess. The expected\nCALET data for scenarios in which DM decay explains the excess are calculated\nand analyzed. The signal from this particular 3-body DM decay which can explain\nthe recent measurements of from the AMS$-02$ experiment is shown to be\ndistinguishable from a single pulsar source causing the positron excess by 5\nyears of observation with CALET, based on the shape of the spectrum. We also\nstudy the constraints from extra-galactic diffuse $\\gamma$-ray data on this\nDM-only explanation of the positron excess and show that especially for the\npossibly remaining parameter space a clearly identifiable signature in the CR\nelectron spectrum exists.\n", "  We compute the orbital angular momentum $L_z$ of an s-wave paired superfluid\nin the presence of an axisymmetric multiply quantized vortex. For vortices with\nwinding number $|k| > 1$, we find that in the weak-pairing BCS regime $L_z$ is\nsignificantly reduced from its value $\\hbar N k/2$ in the Bose-Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) regime, where $N$ is the total number of fermions. This\ndeviation results from the presence of unpaired fermions in the BCS ground\nstate, which arise as a consequence of spectral flow along the vortex sub-gap\nstates. We support our results analytically and numerically by solving the\nBogoliubov-de-Gennes equations within the weak-pairing BCS regime.\n", "  We study systems in which both long-ranged van der Waals and critical Casimir\ninteractions are present. We study the interplay between these forces, as well\nas the {\\it total} force (TF) between a spherical colloid particle and a thick\nplanar slab, and between two spherical colloid particles. We do that using\ngeneral scaling arguments and mean-field type calculations utilizing the\nDerjaguin and the surface integration approaches. They both are based on data\nof the forces between two parallel slabs separated at a distance $L$ from each\nother, confining the fluctuating fluid medium characterized by its temperature\n$T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$. The surfaces of the colloid particles and the\nslab are coated by thin layers exerting strong preference to the liquid phase\nof the fluid, or one of the components of the mixture, modeled by strong\nadsorbing local surface potentials, ensuring the so-called $(+,+)$ boundary\nconditions. On the other hand, the core region of the slab and the particles,\ninfluence the fluid by long-ranged competing dispersion potentials. We\ndemonstrate that for a suitable set of colloids-fluid, slab-fluid, and\nfluid-fluid coupling parameters the competition between the effects due to the\ncoatings and the core regions of the objects involved result, when one changes\n$T$, $\\mu$ or $L$, in {\\it sign change} of the Casimir force (CF) {\\it and} the\nTF acting between the colloid and the slab, as well as between the colloids.\nThis can be used for governing the behavior of objects, say colloidal\nparticles, at small distances, say in colloid suspensions for preventing\nflocculation. It can also provide a strategy for solving problems with\nhandling, feeding, trapping and fixing of microparts in nanotechnology. Data\nfor specific substances in support of the experimental feasibility of the\ntheoretically predicted behavior of the CF and TF have been also presented.\n", "  We study the Landau gauge correlators of Yang-Mills fields for infrared\nEuclidean momenta in the context of a massive extension of the Faddeev-Popov\nLagrangian which, we argue, underlies a variety of continuum approaches.\nStandard (perturbative) renormalization group techniques with a specific,\ninfrared-safe renormalization scheme produce so-called decoupling and scaling\nsolutions for the ghost and gluon propagators, which correspond to nontrivial\ninfrared fixed points. The decoupling fixed point is infrared stable and weakly\ncoupled, while the scaling fixed point is unstable and generically strongly\ncoupled except for low dimensions $d\\to2$. Under the assumption that such a\nscaling fixed point exists beyond one-loop order, we find that the\ncorresponding ghost and gluon scaling exponents are, respectively,\n$2\\alpha_F=2-d$ and $2\\alpha_G=d$ at all orders of perturbation theory in the\npresent renormalization scheme. We discuss the relation between the ghost wave\nfunction renormalization, the gluon screening mass, the scale of spectral\npositivity violation, and the gluon mass parameter. We also show that this\nscaling solution does not realize the standard Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin\nsymmetry of the Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian. Finally, we discuss our findings in\nrelation to the results of nonperturbative continuum methods.\n", "  We study the effect of dust absorption on the recovery velocity and density\nspectra as well as on the anisotropies of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence using\nthe Velocity Channel Analysis (VCA), Velocity Coordinate Spectrum (VCS) and\nVelocity Centroids. The dust limits volume up to an optical depth of unity. We\nshow that in the case of the emissivity proportional to the density of\nemitters, the effects of random density get suppressed for strong dust\nabsorption intensity variations arise from the velocity fluctuations only.\nHowever, for the emissivity proportional to squared density, both density and\nvelocity fluctuations affect the observed intensities. We predict a new\nasymptotic regime for the spectrum of fluctuations for large scales exceeding\nthe physical depths to unit optical depth. The spectrum gets shallower by unity\nin this regime. In addition, the dust absorption removes the degeneracy\nresulted in the universal $K^{-3}$ spectrum of intensity fluctuations of\nself-absorbing medium reported by Lazarian \\& Pogosyan. We show that the\npredicted result is consistent with the available HII region emission data. We\nfind that for sub-Alfv\\'enic and trans-Alfv\\'enic turbulence one can get the\ninformation about both the magnetic field direction and the fundamental\nAlfv\\'en, fast and slow modes that constitute MHD turbulence.\n", "  We study the perturbative unitarity of the Lee-Wick models, formulated as\nnonanalytically Wick rotated Euclidean theories. The complex energy plane is\ndivided into disconnected regions and the values of a loop integral in the\nvarious regions are related to one another by a nonanalytic procedure. We show\nthat the one-loop diagrams satisfy the expected, unitary cutting equations in\neach region: only the physical degrees of freedom propagate through the cuts.\nThe goal can be achieved by working in suitable subsets of each region and\nproving that the cutting equations can be analytically continued as a whole. We\nmake explicit calculations in the cases of the bubble and triangle diagrams and\naddress the generality of our approach. We also show that the same\nhigher-derivative models violate unitarity if they are formulated directly in\nMinkowski spacetime.\n", "  Based on the Euclidean approach, we consider the effects of quantum gravity\nand mass-less matter on the thermodynamic properties of Schwarzschild black\nhole. The techniques of effective field theory are utilized to analytically\nconstruct the partition function at the one-loop level. Using the non-local\nheat kernel formalism, the partition function is expressed as a curvature\nexpansion. We extensively discuss the effect of the corrections on the\nthermodynamic stability. The one-loop free energy shows, remarkably, that a\nlarge number of gauge fields is able to render Schwarzschild black hole\nthermodynamically stable. The black hole mass at which stability is achieved\nscales as $\\sqrt{N}$ in Planck units, where $N$ is the number of gauge fields,\nand is independent of any UV completion of quantum gravity.\n", "  Recently it was shown that an impurity exchanging orbital angular momentum\nwith a surrounding bath can be described in terms of the angulon quasiparticle\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 095301 (2017)]. The angulon consists of a quantum rotor\ndressed by a many-particle field of boson excitations, and can be formed out\nof, for example, a molecule or a nonspherical atom in superfluid helium, or out\nof an electron coupled to lattice phonons or a Bose condensate. Here we develop\nan approach to the angulon based on the path-integral formalism, which sets the\nground for a systematic, perturbative treatment of the angulon problem. The\nresulting perturbation series can be interpreted in terms of Feynman diagrams,\nfrom which, in turn, one can derive a set of diagrammatic rules. These rules\nextend the machinery of the graphical theory of angular momentum - well known\nfrom theoretical atomic spectroscopy - to the case where an environment with an\ninfinite number of degrees of freedom is present. In particular, we show that\neach diagram can be interpreted as a 'skeleton', which enforces angular\nmomentum conservation, dressed by an additional many-body contribution. This\nconnection between the angulon theory and the graphical theory of angular\nmomentum is particularly important as it allows to systematically and\nsubstantially simplify the analytical representation of each diagram. In order\nto exemplify the technique, we calculate the 1- and 2-loop contributions to the\nangulon self-energy, the spectral function, and the quasiparticle weight. The\ndiagrammatic theory we develop paves the way to investigate next-to-leading\norder quantities in a more compact way compared to the variational approaches.\n", "  We present a comprehensive analysis of the spin temperature/covering factor\ndegeneracy, T/f, in damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems. By normalising the\nupper limits and including these via a survival analysis, there is, as\npreviously claimed, an apparent increase in T/f with redshift at z > 1.\nHowever, when we account for the geometry effects of an expanding Universe,\nneglected by the previous studies, this increase in T/f at z > 1 is preceded by\na decrease at z < 1. Using high resolution radio images of the background\ncontinuum sources, we can transform the T/f degeneracy to T/d^2, where d is the\nprojected linear size of the absorber. Again, there is no overall increase with\nredshift, although a dip at z ~ 2 persists. Furthermore, we find d^2/T to\nfollow a similar variation with redshift as the star formation rate. This\nsuggests that, although the total hydrogen column density shows little relation\nto the SFR, the fraction of the cold neutral medium may. Therefore, further\nefforts to link the neutral gas with the star formation history should also\nconsider the cool component of the gas.\n", "  We estimate the spin distribution of primordial black holes based on the\nrecent study of the critical phenomena in the gravitational collapse of a\nrotating radiation fluid. We find that primordial black holes are mostly slowly\nrotating.\n", "  The quest to create superconductors with higher transition temperatures is as\nold as superconductivity itself. One strategy, popular after the realization\nthat (conventional) superconductivity is mediated by phonons, is to chemically\ncombine different elements within the crystalline unit cell to maximize the\nelectron-phonon coupling. This led to the discovery of NbTi and Nb3Sn, to name\njust the most technologically relevant examples. Here, we propose a radically\ndifferent approach to transform a `pristine' material into a better (meta-)\nsuperconductor by making use of modern fabrication techniques: designing and\nengineering the electronic properties of thin films via periodic patterning on\nthe nanoscale. We present a model calculation to explore the key effects of\ndifferent supercells that could be fabricated using nanofabrication or\ndeliberate lattice mismatch, and demonstrate that specific pattern will enhance\nthe coupling and the transition temperature. We also discuss how numerical\nmethods could predict the correct design parameters to improve\nsuperconductivity in materials including Al, NbTi, and MgB2\n", "  The propagation of a heat pulse in a single crystal and across grain\nboundaries (GBs) is simulated using a concurrent atomistic-continuum method\nfurnished with a coherent phonon pulse model. With a heat pulse constructed\nbased on a Bose-Einstein distribution of phonons, this work has reproduced the\nphenomenon of phonon focusing in single and polycrystalline materials.\nSimulation results provide visual evidence that the propagation of a heat pulse\nin crystalline solids with or without GBs is partially ballistic and partially\ndiffusive, i.e., there is a co-existence of ballistic and diffusive thermal\ntransport, with the long-wavelength phonons traveling ballistically while the\nshort-wavelength phonons scatter with each other and travel diffusively. To\ngain a quantitative understanding of GB thermal resistance, the kinetic energy\ntransmitted across GBs is monitored on the fly and the time-dependent energy\ntransmission for each specimen is measured; the contributions of coherent and\nincoherent phonon transport to the energy transmission are estimated.\nSimulation results reveal that the presence of GBs modifies the nature of\nthermal transport, with the coherent long-wavelength phonons dominating the\nheat conduction in materials with GBs. In addition, it is found the phonon-GB\ninteraction can result in the reconstruction of the GBs.\n", "  We discuss the notion of renormalization group (RG) completion of\nnon-Gaussian Lagrangians and its treatment within the framework of\nBogoliubov-Zimmermann theory in application to the matrix and tensor models.\nWith the example of the simplest non-trivial RGB tensor theory (Aristotelian\nrainbow), we introduce a few methods, which allow one to connect calculations\nin the tensor models to those in the matrix models. As a byproduct, we obtain\nsome new factorization formulas and sum rules for the Gaussian correlators in\nthe Hermitian and complex matrix theories, square and rectangular. These sum\nrules describe correlators as solutions to finite linear systems, which are\nmuch simpler than the bilinear Hirota equations and the infinite Virasoro\nrecursion. Search for such relations can be a way to solving the tensor models,\nwhere an explicit integrability is still obscure.\n", "  We summarize the recent results about complete solvability of Hermitian and\nrectangular complex matrix models. Partition functions have very simple\ncharacter expansions with coefficients made from dimensions of representation\nof the linear group $GL(N)$, and arbitrary correlators in the Gaussian phase\nare given by finite sums over Young diagrams of a given size, which involve\nalso the well known characters of symmetric group. The previously known\nintegrability and Virasoro constraints are simple corollaries, but no vice\nversa: complete solvability is a peculiar property of the matrix model\n(hypergeometric) $\\tau$-functions, which is actually a combination of these two\ncomplementary requirements.\n", "  The modern conformal bootstrap program often employs the method of linear\nfunctionals to derive the numerical or analytical bounds on the CFT data. These\nfunctionals must have a crucial \"swapping\" property, allowing to swap infinite\nsummation with the action of the functional in the conformal bootstrap sum\nrule. Swapping is easy to justify for the popular functionals involving finite\nsums of derivatives. However, it is far from obvious for \"cut-touching\"\nfunctionals, involving integration over regions where conformal block\ndecomposition does not converge uniformly. Functionals of this type were\nrecently considered by Mazac in his work on analytic derivation of optimal\nbootstrap bounds. We derive general swapping criteria for the cut-touching\nfunctionals, and check in a few explicit examples that Mazac's functionals pass\nour criteria.\n", "  We present an algorithm for the optimization and thermal equilibration of\nspin glasses - or more generally, cost functions of the Ising form\n$H=\\sum_{\\langle i j\\rangle} J_{ij} s_i s_j + \\sum_i h_i s_i$, defined on\ngraphs with arbitrary connectivity. The algorithm consists of two repeated\nsteps: i) the optimized construction of a random tree of spin clusters on the\ninput problem graph, and ii) the thermal sampling of the generated tree. The\nrandomly generated trees are constructed so as to optimize a balance between\nthe size of the tree and the complexity required to draw Boltzmann samples from\nit. We benchmark the algorithm on several classes of problems and demonstrate\nits advantages over existing approaches.\n", "  The extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) of stellar-mass compact objects into\nmassive black holes are an important class of source for the future space-based\ngravitational-wave detector LISA. Detecting signals from EMRIs will require\nwaveform models that are both accurate and computationally efficient. In this\npaper, we present the latest implementation of an augmented analytic kludge\n(AAK) model, publicly available at github.com/alvincjk/EMRI_Kludge_Suite as\npart of an EMRI waveform software suite. This version of the AAK model has\nimproved accuracy compared to its predecessors, with two-month waveform\noverlaps against a more accurate fiducial model exceeding 0.97 for a generic\nrange of sources; it also generates waveforms 5-15 times faster than the\nfiducial model. The AAK model is well suited for scoping out data analysis\nissues in the upcoming round of mock LISA data challenges. A simple analytic\nargument shows that it might even be viable for detecting EMRIs with LISA\nthrough a semi-coherent template bank method, while the use of the original\nanalytic kludge in the same approach will result in around 90% fewer\ndetections.\n", "  We analyze the momentum- and temperature dependences of the magnetic\nsusceptibilities and magnetic exchange interaction in paramagnetic bcc iron by\na combination of density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory\n(DFT+DMFT). By considering a general derivation of the orbital-resolved\neffective model for spin degrees of freedom for Hund's metals, we relate\nmomentum-dependent susceptibilities in the paramagnetic phase to the magnetic\nexchange. We then calculate non-uniform orbital-resolved susceptibilities at\nhigh-symmetry wave vectors by constructing appropriate supercells in the DMFT\napproach. Extracting the irreducible parts of susceptibilities with respect to\nHund's exchange interaction, we determine the corresponding orbital-resolved\nexchange interactions, which are then interpolated to the whole Brillouin zone.\nUsing the spherical model we estimate the temperature dependence of the\nresulting exchange between local moments.\n", "  Rare transitions between long-lived stable states are often analyzed in terms\nof free energy landscapes computed as functions of a few collective variables.\nHere, using transitions between geometric phases as example, we demonstrate\nthat the effective dynamics of a system along these variables are an essential\ningredient in the description of rare events and that the static perspective\nprovided by the free energy alone may be misleading. In particular, we\ninvestigate the disk-to-slab transition in the two-dimensional Ising model\nstarting with a calculation of a two-dimensional free energy landscape and the\ndistribution of committor probabilities. While at first sight it appears that\nthe committor is incompatible with the free energy, they can be reconciled with\neach other using a two-dimensional Smoluchowski equation that combines the free\nenergy landscape with state dependent diffusion coefficients. These results\nillustrate that dynamical information is not only required to calculate rate\nconstants but that neglecting dynamics may also lead to an inaccurate\nunderstanding of the mechanism of a given process.\n", "  We investigate the transverse charge densities of the deuteron in a soft-wall\nAdS/QCD model by considering both the unpolarized and the transversely\npolarized cases. The deuteron form factors are derived from the soft-wall\nAdS/QCD model and it is shown that the calculated results agree with the\nphenomenological parametrization and experimental data. The transverse charge\ndensities of the deuteron are also derived from the soft-wall AdS/QCD model,\nand we notice slight deviations from those of the phenomenological\nparametrization.\n", "  We study the nonequilibrium quench dynamics of a one-dimensional anyonic gas.\nWe focus on the integrable anyonic Lieb-Liniger model and consider the quench\nfrom non-interacting to hard-core anyons. We study the dynamics of the local\nproperties of the system. By means of integrability-based methods we compute\nanalytically the one-body density matrix and the density-density correlation\nfunction at all times after the quench and in particular at infinite time. Our\nresults show that the system evolves from an initial state where the local\nmomentum distribution function is non-symmetric to a steady state where it\nbecomes symmetric. Furthermore, while the initial momentum distribution\nfunctions (and the equilibrium ones) explicitly depend on the anyonic\nparameter, the final ones do not. This is reminiscent of the dynamical\nfermionization observed in the context of free expansions after release from a\nconfining trap.\n", "  Blow-up of solutions for the cosmological fluid equations, often dubbed\nshell-crossing or orbit crossing, denotes the breakdown of the single-stream\nregime of the cold-dark-matter fluid. At this instant, the velocity becomes\nmulti-valued and the density singular. Shell-crossing is well understood in one\ndimension (1D), but not in higher dimensions. This paper is about\nquasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) flow that depends on all three coordinates but\ndiffers only slightly from a strictly 1D flow, thereby allowing a perturbative\ntreatment of shell-crossing using the Euler--Poisson equations written in\nLagrangian coordinates. The signature of shell-crossing is then just the\nvanishing of the Jacobian of the Lagrangian map, a regular perturbation\nproblem. In essence the problem of the first shell-crossing, which is highly\nsingular in Eulerian coordinates, has been desingularized by switching to\nLagrangian coordinates, and can then be handled by perturbation theory. Here,\nall-order recursion relations are obtained for the time-Taylor coefficients of\nthe displacement field, and it is shown that the Taylor series has an infinite\nradius of convergence. This allows the determination of the time and location\nof the first shell-crossing, which is generically shown to be taking place\nearlier than for the unperturbed 1D flow. The time variable used for these\nstatements is not the cosmic time $t$ but the linear growth time $\\tau \\sim\nt^{2/3}$. For simplicity, calculations are restricted to an Einstein--de Sitter\nuniverse in the Newtonian approximation, and tailored initial data are used.\nHowever it is straightforward to relax these limitations, if needed.\n", "  Light properties in the mid-infrared can be controlled at a deep\nsubwavelength scale using hyperbolic phonons-polaritons (HPPs) of hexagonal\nboron nitride (h-BN). While propagating as waveguided modes HPPs can\nconcentrate the electric field in a chosen nano-volume. Such a behavior is at\nthe heart of many applications including subdiffraction imaging and sensing.\nHere, we employ HPPs in heterostructures of h-BN and graphene as new\nnano-optoelectronic platform by uniting the benefits of efficient hot-carrier\nphotoconversion in graphene and the hyperbolic nature of h-BN. We demonstrate\nelectrical detection of HPPs by guiding them towards a graphene pn-junction. We\nshine a laser beam onto a gap in metal gates underneath the heterostructure,\nwhere the light is converted into HPPs. The HPPs then propagate as confined\nrays heating up the graphene leading to a strong photocurrent. This concept is\nexploited to boost the external responsivity of mid-infrared photodetectors,\novercoming the limitation of graphene pn-junction detectors due to their small\nactive area and weak absorption. Moreover this type of detector exhibits\ntunable frequency selectivity due to the HPPs, which combined with its high\nresponsivity paves the way for efficient high-resolution mid-infrared imaging.\n", "  Covariant density functional theory and three-dimensional tilted axis\ncranking are used to investigate multiple chirality in nuclear rotation for the\nfirst time in a fully self-consistent and microscopic way. Two distinct sets of\nchiral solutions with negative and positive parities, respectively, are found\nin the nucleus 106Rh. The negative-parity solutions reproduce well the\ncorresponding experimental spectrum as well as the B(M1)/B(E2) ratios of the\ntransition strengths. This indicates that a predicted positive-parity chiral\nband should also exist. Therefore, it provides a further strong hint that\nmultiple chirality is realized in nuclei.\n", "  A new semi-automatic approach is employed to carry out the abundance analysis\nof high-resolution spectra of HD41076 and HD148330 obtained recently with the\nspectropolarimetre ESPaDOnS at the CFHT. This approach allows to prepare in a\nsemi-automatic mode the input data for the modified ZEEMAN2 code and to analyse\nseveral hundreds of line profiles in sequence during a single run. It also\nprovides more information on abundance distribution for each chemical element\nat the deeper atmospheric layers. Our analysis of the Balmer profiles observed\nin the spectra of HD41076 and HD148330 has resulted in the estimates of their\neffective temperature, gravity, metallicity and radial velocity. The respective\nmodels of stellar atmosphere have been calculated with the code PHOENIX and\nused to carry out abundance analysis employing the modified ZEEMAN2 code. The\nanalysis shows a deficit of the C, N, F, Mg, Ca, Ti, V, Cu, Y, Mo, Sm and Gd,\nand overabundance of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Sr, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd and Dy in the\nstellar atmosphere of HD41076. In the atmosphere of HD148330, the C, N and Mo\nappear to be underabundant, while the Ne, Na, Al, Si, P, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe,\nCo, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd and Dy are overabundant. We\nalso have found signatures of vertical abundance stratification of Fe, Ti, Cr\nand Mn in HD41076, and of Fe, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Ce, Nd, Sm and Gd in\nHD148330.\n", "  We derive the Ashtekar-Barbero variables in Loop Quantum Gravity(LQG)\nstarting from the Palatini action. We find that we need either the torsion-free\ncondition or the compatibility condition for the Palatini action to describe\nGeneral Relativity.\n", "  It was recently conjectured by Vivo, Pato, and Oshanin [Phys. Rev. E 93,\n052106 (2016)] that for a quantum system of Hilbert dimension $mn$ in a pure\nstate, the variance of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of dimension\n$m\\leq n$ is given by \\begin{equation*}\n-\\psi_{1}\\left(mn+1\\right)+\\frac{m+n}{mn+1}\\psi_{1}\\left(n\\right)-\\frac{(m+1)(m+2n+1)}{4n^{2}(mn+1)},\n\\end{equation*} where $\\psi_{1}(\\cdot)$ is the trigamma function. We give a\nproof of this formula.\n", "  In ecology it is widely recognised that many landscapes comprise a network of\ndiscrete patches of habitat. The species that inhabit the patches interact with\neach other through a foodweb, the network of feeding interactions. The\nmeta-foodweb model proposed by Pillai et al. combines the feeding relationships\nat each patch with the dispersal of species between patches, such that the\nwhole system is represented by a network of networks. Previous work on\nmeta-foodwebs has focussed on landscape networks that do not have an explicit\nspatial embedding, but in real landscapes the patches are usually distributed\nin space. Here we compare the dispersal of a meta-foodweb on \\ER networks, that\ndo not have a spatial embedding, and random geometric networks, that do have a\nspatial embedding. We found that local structure and large network distances in\nspatially embedded networks, lead to meso-scale patterns of patch occupation by\nboth specialist and omnivorous species. In particular, we found that spatial\nseparations make the coexistence of competing species more likely. Our results\nhighlight the effects of spatial embeddings for meta-foodweb models, and the\nneed for new analytical approaches to them.\n", "  A method is proposed to determine the one-neutron $S_n$ or two-neutron\n$S_{2n}$ separation energy of neutron-rich isotopes. Relationships between\n$S_n$ ($S_{2n}$) and isotopic cross sections have been deduced from an\nempirical formula, i.e., the cross section of an isotope exponentially depends\non the average binding energy per nucleon $B/A$. The proposed relationships\nhave been verified using the neutron-rich copper isotopes measured in the 64$A$\nMeV $^{86}$Kr + $^{9}$Be reaction. $S_n$, $S_{2n}$, and $B/A$ for the very\nneutron-rich $^{77, 78, 79}$Cu isotopes are determined from the proposed\ncorrelations. It is also proposed that the correlations between $S_n$, $S_{2n}$\nand isotopic cross sections can be used to find the location of neutron drip\nline isotopes.\n", "  We investigate the interaction between the magnetized stellar wind plasma and\nthe partially ionized hydrodynamic hydrogen outflow from the escaping upper\natmosphere of non- or weakly magnetized hot Jupiters. We use the well-studied\nhot Jupiter HD 209458b as an example for similar exoplanets, assuming a\nnegligible intrinsic magnetic moment. For this planet, the stellar wind plasma\ninteraction forms an obstacle in the planet's upper atmosphere, in which the\nposition of the magnetopause is determined by the condition of pressure balance\nbetween the stellar wind and the expanded atmosphere, heated by the stellar\nextreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation. We show that the neutral atmospheric atoms\npenetrate into the region dominated by the stellar wind, where they are ionized\nby photo-ionization and charge exchange, and then mixed with the stellar wind\nflow. Using a 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, we show that an induced\nmagnetic field forms in front of the planetary obstacle, which appears to be\nmuch stronger compared to those produced by the solar wind interaction with\nVenus and Mars. Depending on the stellar wind parameters, because of the\ninduced magnetic field, the planetary obstacle can move up to ~0.5-1 planetary\nradii closer to the planet. Finally, we discuss how estimations of the\nintrinsic magnetic moment of hot Jupiters can be inferred by coupling\nhydrodynamic upper planetary atmosphere and MHD stellar wind interaction models\ntogether with UV observations. In particular, we find that HD 209458b should\nlikely have an intrinsic magnetic moment of 10-20% that of Jupiter.\n", "  Quantum annealing algorithms belong to the class of meta-heuristic tools,\napplicable for solving binary optimization problems. Hardware implementations\nof quantum annealing, such as the quantum processing units (QPUs) produced by\nD-Wave Systems, have been subject to multiple analyses in research, with the\naim of characterizing the technology's usefulness for optimization and sampling\ntasks. In this paper, we present a real-world application that uses quantum\ntechnologies. Specifically, we show how to map certain parts of the real-world\ntraffic flow optimization problem to be suitable for quantum annealing. We show\nthat time-critical optimization tasks, such as continuous redistribution of\nposition data for cars in dense road networks, are suitable candidates for\nquantum applications. Due to the limited size and connectivity of\ncurrent-generation D-Wave QPUs, we use a hybrid quantum and classical approach\nto solve the traffic flow problem.\n", "  We investigate the interfacial wave coupling dynamics in liquid metal\nbatteries and their effects to the battery's operation safety. Similar to\naluminum reduction cells, liquid metal batteries can be highly susceptible to\nmagnetohydrodynamical instabilities that excite undesired interfacial waves\ncapable to provoke short-circuits. However, in liquid metal batteries the wave\ndynamics is far more complex since two metal-electrolyte interfaces are present\nthat may step into resonance. In the first part of this paper, we present a\nPotential analysis of coupled gravity-capillary interfacial waves in a\nthree-layer battery model of cylindrical shape. Analytical expressions for the\namplitude ratio and the wave frequencies are derived and it is shown that the\nwave coupling can be completely described by two independent dimensionless\nparameters. We provide a decoupling criterion clarifying that wave coupling\nwill be present in most future liquid metal batteries. In the second part, the\ntheory is validated by comparing it with multiphase direct numerical\nsimulations. An accompanying parameter study is conducted to analyze the system\nstability for differently strongly coupled interfaces. Three different coupling\nregimes are identified involving characteristic coupling dynamics. For strongly\ncoupled interfaces we observe novel instabilities that may have beneficial\neffects on the operational safety.\n", "  Electrical signals play the primary role in rapid communication among organs,\ntissues and cells in biosystems. We have analyzed and discussed three phenomena\nof electrical communication in biosystems, including direction-changing\nmovement of paramecia, prey behavior of flytraps, and simultaneous discharge of\nelectric ells. These discussions lead to a conclusion that in biosystems the\nelectrical signals are mainly soliton-like electromagnetic pulses, which are\ngenerated by transient transmembrane ion currents through protein ion-channels.\nThese electromagnetic signals mainly propagate along the softmaterial waveguide\nwhich is basically composed of dielectric membrane, sandwiched in two ionic\nliquid layers at both sides. In myelinated axons, the dielectric layer is as\nthick as several microns as it consists of tens of lipid bilayers. This\ntransmission model implies that a wireless communication mechanism has been\nnaturally developed in biosystem. This hypothesis may shed some light on the\nworking mechanism of ten billion neurons in a human brain.\n", "  Nanoribbons produced from cutting {\\beta}_12-Borophene sheet is investigated\nby density functional theory. The electronic and magnetic properties of\nBorophene nanoribbons are studied and found that all considered ribbons are\nmetal which is in good agreement with recent experimental results.\n{\\beta}_12-Borophene nanoribbons have a lot of diversity due to existence of 5\nBoron atoms in a unit cell of the sheet. The magnetic properties of ribbons are\nstrongly dependent on the cutting direction and the edge profile. It is\ninteresting that a ribbon with a specific width can be a normal or\nferromagnetic metal with magnetization in just one edge or two edges. The spin\nanisotropy is observed in some ribbons so that magnetic moment is not the same\nin both edges in antiferromagnetic configuration. The effect comes from the\nedge asymmetry of the ribbons and results in the breaking of spin degeneracy in\nthe bandstructure. Our findings show that {\\beta}_12 nanoribbons are potential\ncandidates for next-generation spintronic devices.\n", "  HIV/AIDS spread depends upon complex patterns of interaction among various\nsub-sets emerging at population level. This added complexity makes it difficult\nto study and model AIDS and its dynamics. AIDS is therefore a natural candidate\nto be modeled using agent-based modeling, a paradigm well-known for modeling\nComplex Adaptive Systems (CAS). While agent-based models are also well-known to\neffectively model CAS, often times models can tend to be ambiguous and the use\nof purely text-based specifications (such as ODD) can make models difficult to\nbe replicated. Previous work has shown how formal specification may be used in\nconjunction with agent-based modeling to develop models of various CAS.\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, no such model has been developed in\nconjunction with AIDS. In this paper, we present a Formal Agent-Based\nSimulation modeling framework (FABS-AIDS) for an AIDS-based CAS. FABS-AIDS\nemploys the use of a formal specification model in conjunction with an\nagent-based model to reduce ambiguity as well as improve clarity in the model\ndefinition. The proposed model demonstrates the effectiveness of using formal\nspecification in conjunction with agent-based simulation for developing models\nof CAS in general and, social network-based agent-based models, in particular.\n", "  Most of our current knowledge on condensed matters contains a default\nassumption: the matters are neutral charged. On the other hand, the\ntwo-dimension(2D) vortex-Coulomb gas charge analogy is a very successful\ntheoretical tool in explaining superfluid, type-II superconductor and\nfractional quantum Hall effect(FQHE), because the interaction among vortices\nshow similarity with 2D Coulomb potential. Here, by breaking the 'neutral\ncharged' assumption, we suggest the positively charged 2D semiconductor system\ncan possess non-trivial particle-like charge centers(called 'quasihole'), which\nis the charge version of 'vortex'. Using the hypernetted-chain (HNC)\napproximation, the structure of quasihole is elucidated. Numerical calculations\nshow that the quasihole can be projected onto another 2D layer, producing an\nelectric field configuration characterized by 3/2 topological charge.\n", "  Multilayered graphitic materials are not suitable as load-bearers due to\ntheir inherent weak interlayer bonding (for example, graphite is a solid\nlubricant in certain applications). This situation is largely improved when\ntwo-dimensional (2-D) materials such as a monolayer (SLG) graphene are\nemployed. The downside in these cases is the presence of thermally or\nmechanically induced wrinkles which are ubiquitous in 2-D materials. Here we\nset out to examine the effect of extensive large wavelength/ amplitude\nwrinkling on the stress transfer capabilities of exfoliated simply-supported\ngraphene flakes. Contrary to common belief we present clear evidence that this\ntype of \"corrugation\" enhances the load bearing capacity of few-layer graphene\nas compared to 'flat' specimens. This effect is the result of the significant\nincrease of the graphene/polymer interfacial shear stress per increment of\napplied strain due to wrinkling and paves the way for designing affordable\ngraphene composites with highly improved stress-transfer efficiency.\n", "  Under ambient conditions, we directly observed NaCl crystals experimentally\nin the rGO membranes soaked in the salt solution with concentration below and\nfar below the saturated concentration. Moreover, in most probability, the NaCl\ncrystals show stoichiometries behavior. We attribute this unexpected\ncrystallization to the cation-{\\pi} interactions between the ions and the\naromatic rings of the rGO.\n", "  Magnetic energy of simple cubic structured ferromagnetic films with 10 to 50\nspin layers was determined using third order perturbed Heisenberg Hamiltonian.\nBy plotting 3-D plot of energy versus angle and stress induced anisotropy, the\nvalues of stress induced anisotropy corresponding to energy minimums and\nmaximums were determined. By plotting the graphs of energy versus angle at\nthese different stress induced anisotropy values, the easy and hard directions\nwere determined. Magnetic easy and hard directions are related to energy\nminimums and maximums of the curve. Similar graphs were plotted for spin\nexchange interaction to determine the easy and hard directions. Graphs of\nenergy versus angle were plotted by keeping all the magnetic energy parameters\nat constant values for each number of spin layers to determine the variation of\nmagnetic easy directions, hard direction and corresponding energies with the\nnumber of spin layers. The magnetic easy axis gradually rotates from out of\nplane to in plane direction as the number of spin layers is increased. In\naddition, the magnetic anisotropy energy increases with the number of spin\nlayers.\n", "  During the past two decades, experiments in both the northern and southern\nhemispheres have observed a small but measurable energy-dependent sidereal\nanisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of Galactic cosmic rays with\nrelative intensities at the level of one per mille. Individually, these\nmeasurements are restricted by limited sky coverage, and so the power spectrum\nof the anisotropy obtained from any one measurement displays a systematic\ncorrelation between different multipole modes $C_\\ell$. We present the results\nof a joint analysis of the anisotropy on all angular scales using cosmic-ray\ndata collected during 336 days of operation of the High-Altitude Water\nCherenkov (HAWC) Observatory (located at 19$^\\circ$ N) and 5 years of data\ntaking from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (located at 90$^\\circ$ S) The\nresults include a combined sky map and an all-sky power spectrum in the\noverlapping energy range of the two experiments at around 10 TeV. We describe\nthe methods used to combine the IceCube and HAWC data, address the individual\ndetector systematics, and study the region of overlapping field of view between\nthe two observatories.\n", "  The local environment and the charge state of a nickel impurity in cubic\nBa$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$TiO$_3$ are studied by XAFS spectroscopy. According to the\nXANES data, the mean Ni charge state is $\\sim$2.5+. An analysis of the EXAFS\nspectra and their comparison with the results of first-principle calculations\nof the defect geometry suggest that Ni$^{2+}$ ions are in a high-spin state at\nthe $B$ sites of the perovskite structure and the difference of the Ni$^{2+}$\nand Ti$^{4+}$ charges is mainly compensated by distant oxygen vacancies. In\naddition, a considerable amount of nickel in the sample is in a second phase\nBaNiO$_{3-\\delta}$. The measurements of the lattice parameter show a decrease\nin the unit cell volume upon doping, which can indicate the existence of a\nsmall amount of Ni$^{4+}$ ions at the $B$ sites.\n", "  We present a search for new high mass phenomena using the latest data\ncollected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC, corresponding to 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ at\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The search is conducted for both resonant and non-resonant\nnew phenomena in dimuon final states. The dimuon invariant mass spectrum is the\ndiscriminating variable used in the search. No significant deviations from the\nStandard Model expectation are observed. Lower limits are set on the signal\nparameters of interest at 95% credibility level, using a Bayesian\ninterpretation. In particular, a Sequential Standard Model Z' resonance is\nexcluded for masses below 4.0 TeV.\n", "  These are some thoughts contained in a letter to colleagues, about the close\nrelation between gravity and quantum mechanics, and also about the possibility\nof seeing quantum gravity in a lab equipped with quantum computers. I expect\nthis will become feasible sometime in the next decade or two.\n", "  Recent proposal of the duality between the $N=2$ noncompact QED$_3$ and the\neasy-plane noncompact CP$^1$ (NCCP$^1$) model suggests that the deconfined\nquantum critical point (dQCP) between the easy-plane antiferromagnet and the\nVBS order on the square lattice may have an emergent O(4) symmetry, due to the\nself-duality of the $N=2$ noncompact QED$_3$. Recent numerical progresses\nsuggest that this easy-plane dQCP does exist and it has an emergent O(4)\nsymmetry. But for the O(4) symmetry to really emerge at the dQCP, certain O(4)\nsymmetry breaking perturbations need to be irrelevant at the putative O(4)\nfixed point. It is more convenient to study these symmetry breaking\nperturbations in the $N=2$ noncompact QED$_3$. We demonstrate that a natural\nlarge-$N$ generalization and a controlled $1/N$ expansion supports the\nstability of the O(4) fixed point against the symmetry breaking perturbations.\nWe also develop the theory for two tricritical points close to the easy-plane\ndQCP. One tricritical point is between the dQCP and a {\\it self-dual} $Z_2$\ntopological order; the other is the tricritical point that connects the\ncontinuous dQCP and a first order N\\'{e}el-VBS transition, motivated by recent\nnumerical results.\n", "  The main result of this article is the determination of the minimal size for\nthe general case of problems with two identical patches. This solution is\npresented in the explicit form, which allows to recuperate all the cases found\nin the literature as particular cases, namely, one isolated fragment, one\nsingle fragment communicating with its neighborhood, a system with two\nidentical fragments isolated from the matrix but mutually communicating and a\nsystem of two identical fragments inserted in a homogeneous matrix. It is also\naddressed the new problem of a single fragment communicating with the matrix,\nwith different life difficulty of each side. As application, it is found that\nthe internal condition $a_{0}$ can set which system is the worst to life. This\nprediction confirms and extends the prediction already found in the literature\nbetween isolated and non-isolated systems.\n", "  We present measurements showing how disorder determines the dynamics of a\nvortex lattice. Using superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) arrays placed\nin finite magnetic fields, disorder is introduced by shifting the field away\nfrom values where the vortex lattice is commensurate with the SNS array. By\napplying a current to drive vortex motion, we observe a two-step transition at\nincommensurate fields: first from pinned vortices to lattice defect motion, and\nthen from individual defect to bulk vortex lattice flow. This behavior is\nconsistent with a polycrystalline vortex structure where defects form on the\nedges of crystalline domains. This demonstrates that a disordered, interacting\nvortex system can favor interface physics rather than a quasiperiodic regime.\n", "  We study the spectral transition line of the extended Harper's model in the\npositive Lyapunov exponent regime. We show that both pure point spectrum and\npurely singular continuous spectrum occur for dense subsets of frequencies on\nthe transition line.\n", "  With recent trends on miniaturizing oxide-based devices, the need for\natomic-scale control of surface/interface structures by pulsed laser deposition\n(PLD) has increased. In particular, realizing uniform atomic termination at the\nsurface/interface is highly desirable. However, a lack of understanding on the\nsurface formation mechanism in PLD has limited a deliberate control of\nsurface/interface atomic stacking sequences. Here, taking the prototypical\nSrRuO3/BaTiO3/SrRuO3 (SRO/BTO/SRO) heterostructure as a model system, we\ninvestigated the formation of different interfacial termination sequences\n(BaO-RuO2 or TiO2-SrO) with oxygen partial pressure (PO2) during PLD. We found\nthat a uniform SrO-TiO2 termination sequence at the SRO/BTO interface can be\nachieved by lowering the PO2 to 5 mTorr, regardless of the total background gas\npressure (Ptotal), growth mode, or growth rate. Our results indicate that the\nthermodynamic stability of the BTO surface at the low-energy kinetics stage of\nPLD can play an important role in surface/interface termination formation. This\nwork paves the way for realizing termination engineering in functional oxide\nheterostructures.\n", "  Two body nonleptonic weak decays of bottom mesons to a pseudoscalar meson and\nan axial-vector meson involving charmed states are studied using the\nnon-relativistic quark model. We calculate the branching ratios of these decays\nby employing the factorization hypothesis. Obtained results are in good\nagreement with the existing experimental data. We also calculated the branching\nratios in the light of heavy quark symmetry constraints and compared with the\nexiting theoretical analyses.\n", "  The distribution and isotopic composition of volatile elements in planetary\nmaterials holds a key to the characterization of the early solar system and the\nMoon's formation. The Moon and Earth are chemically and isotopically very\nsimilar. However, the Moon is highly depleted in volatile elements and the\norigin of this depletion is still debated. We present gallium isotopic and\nelemental measurements in a large set of lunar samples to constrain the origin\nof this volatile depletion. We show that while Ga has a geochemical behavior\ndifferent from zinc, both elements show a systematic enrichment in the heavier\nisotopes in lunar mare basalts and Mg-suite rocks compared to the silicate\nEarth, pointing to a global-scale depletion event. On the other hand, the\nferroan anorthosites are isotopically heterogeneous, suggesting a secondary\ndistribution of Ga at the surface of the Moon by volatilization and\ncondensation. The isotopic difference of Ga between Earth and the Moon and the\nisotopic heterogeneity of the crustal ferroan anorthosites suggest that the\nvolatile depletion occurred following the giant impact and during the lunar\nmagma ocean phase. These results point toward a Moon that has lost its volatile\nelements during a whole-scale evaporation event and that is now relatively dry\ncompared to Earth.\n", "  The design of a self-complementary metallic checkerboard pattern achieves\nbroadband, dispersion-less, and maximized absorption, concentrating in the deep\nsubwavelength resistive connections between squares, without any theoretical\nlimitation on the energy absorbing area. Here, we experimentally and\nnumerically investigate the electromagnetic response in the limit of extremely\nsmall connections. We show that finite conductivity and randomness in a\nnear-self-complementary checkerboard pattern plays a crucial role in producing\na frequency-independent energy loss in the terahertz frequency region. Here\nmetals behave like an almost perfect conductor. When the checkerboard pattern\napproaches the perfect self-complementary pattern, the perfect conductor\napproximation spontaneously breaks down, owing to the finite conductivity at\nthe nano- scale connection, leading to broadband absorption. It is also shown\nthat the random connections between metallic squares also lead to broadband and\nmaximized energy loss through scattering loss, similar to finite conductivity.\n", "  We discuss the phenomenology of the split energy cascade in a\nthree-dimensional thin fluid layer by mean of high resolution numerical\nsimulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. We observe the presence of both an\ninverse energy cascade at large scales, as predicted for two-dimensional turbu-\nlence, and of a direct energy cascade at small scales, as in three-dimensional\nturbulence. The inverse energy cascade is associated with a direct cascade of\nenstrophy in the intermediate range of scales. Notably, we find that the\ninverse cascade of energy in this system is not a pure 2D phenomenon, as the\ncoupling with the 3D velocity field is necessary to guarantee the constancy of\nfluxes.\n", "  We analyze invariant measures of two coupled piecewise linear and everywhere\nexpanding maps on the synchronization manifold. We observe that though the\nindividual maps have simple and smooth functions as their stationary densities,\nthey become multifractal as soon as two of them are coupled nonlinearly even\nwith a small coupling. For some maps, the multifractal spectrum seems to be\nrobust with the coupling or map parameters and for some other maps, there is a\nsubstantial variation. The origin of the multifractal spectrum here is\nintriguing as it does not seem to conform to the existing theory of\nmultifractal functions.\n", "  The development and operation of Liquid-Argon Time-Projection Chambers for\nneutrino physics has created a need for new approaches to pattern recognition\nin order to fully exploit the imaging capabilities offered by this technology.\nWhereas the human brain can excel at identifying features in the recorded\nevents, it is a significant challenge to develop an automated, algorithmic\nsolution. The Pandora Software Development Kit provides functionality to aid\nthe design and implementation of pattern-recognition algorithms. It promotes\nthe use of a multi-algorithm approach to pattern recognition, in which\nindividual algorithms each address a specific task in a particular topology.\nMany tens of algorithms then carefully build up a picture of the event and,\ntogether, provide a robust automated pattern-recognition solution. This paper\ndescribes details of the chain of over one hundred Pandora algorithms and tools\nused to reconstruct cosmic-ray muon and neutrino events in the MicroBooNE\ndetector. Metrics that assess the current pattern-recognition performance are\npresented for simulated MicroBooNE events, using a selection of final-state\nevent topologies.\n", "  The positron excess measured by PAMELA and AMS can only be explained if there\nis one or several sources injecting them. Moreover, at the highest energies, it\nrequires the presence of nearby ($\\sim$hundreds of parsecs) and middle age\n(maximum of $\\sim$hundreds of kyr) source. Pulsars, as factories of electrons\nand positrons, are one of the proposed candidates to explain the origin of this\nexcess. To calculate the contribution of these sources to the electron and\npositron flux at the Earth, we developed EDGE (Electron Diffusion and Gamma\nrays to the Earth), a code to treat diffusion of electrons and compute their\ndiffusion from a central source with a flexible injection spectrum. We can\nderive the source's gamma-ray spectrum, spatial extension, the all-electron\ndensity in space and the electron and positron flux reaching the Earth. We\npresent in this contribution the fundamentals of the code and study how\ndifferent parameters affect the gamma-ray spectrum of a source and the electron\nflux measured at the Earth.\n", "  In part I of this analysis, the striking similarities of the declining oil\nproduction in the North Sea, Indonesia and Mexico were used to model the future\nmaximum possible oil production per annum in all larger countries and regions\nof the planet from 2015 to 2050.\n  In part II, the oil export and oil consumption patterns, that were\nestablished in recent decades, are combined with the consequences of the\nforecast declines in regional oil production that were developed in part I of\nthis analysis. The results are quantitative predictions of the maximum possible\nregion-by-region oil consumption during the next 20 years.\n  The predictions indicate that several of the larger oil consuming and\nimporting countries and regions will be confronted with the economic\nconsequences of the onset of the world's final oil supply crisis as early as\n2020. In particular, during the next few years a reduction of the average per\ncapita oil consumption of about 5%/year is predicted for most OECD countries in\nWestern Europe, and slightly smaller reductions, about 2-3%/year, is predicted\nfor all other oil importing countries and regions. The consequences of the\npredicted oil supply crisis are thoroughly at odds with business-as-usual,\nnever-ending-global-growth predictions of oil production and consumption.\n", "  Among the n-type metal oxide materials used in the planar perovskite solar\ncells, zinc oxide (ZnO) is a promising candidate to replace titanium dioxide\n(TiO2) due to its relatively high electron mobility, high transparency, and\nversatile nanostructures. Here, we present the application of low temperature\nsolution processed ZnO/Al-doped ZnO (AZO) bilayer thin film as electron\ntransport layers (ETLs) in the inverted perovskite solar cells, which provide a\nstair-case band profile. Experimental results revealed that the power\nconversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells were significantly\nincreased from 12.25 to 16.07% by employing the AZO thin film as the buffer\nlayer. Meanwhile, the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage\n(Voc), and fill factor (FF) were improved to 20.58 mA/cm2, 1.09V, and 71.6%,\nrespectively. The enhancement in performance is attributed to the modified\ninterface in ETL with stair-case band alignment of ZnO/AZO/CH3NH3PbI3, which\nallows more efficient extraction of photogenerated electrons in the CH3NH3PbI3\nactive layer. Thus, it is demonstrated that the ZnO/AZO bilayer ETLs would\nbenefit the electron extraction and contribute in enhancing the performance of\nperovskite solar cells.\n", "  There are multiple ways in which to select post-starburst galaxies in the\nliterature. In this work, we present a study into how two well-used selection\ntechniques have consequences on observable post-starburst galaxy parameters,\nsuch as colour, morphology and environment and how this affects interpretations\nof their role in the galaxy duty cycle. We identify a master sample of\nH$\\delta$ strong (EW$_{H\\delta}$ > 3\\AA) post-starburst galaxies from the\nvalue-added catalogue in the 7th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS DR7) over a redshift range 0.01 < $z$ < 0.1. From this sample we select\ntwo E+A subsets, both having a very little [OII] emission (EW$_{[OII]}$ $>\n-2.5$\\AA) but one having an additional cut on EW$_{H\\alpha}$ ($> -3$\\AA). We\nexamine the differences in observables and AGN fractions to see what effect the\nH$\\alpha$ cut has on the properties of post-starburst galaxies and what these\ndiffering samples can tell us about the duty cycle of post-starburst galaxies.\nWe find that H$\\delta$ strong galaxies peak in the `blue cloud', E+As in the\n`green valley' and pure E+As in the `red sequence'. We also find that pure E+As\nhave a more early-type morphology and a higher fraction in denser environments\ncompared with the H$\\delta$ strong and E+A galaxies. These results suggest that\nthere is an evolutionary sequence in the post-starburst phase from blue disky\ngalaxies with residual star formation to passive red early-types.\n", "  We present a calculation of the electromagnetic form factors of the $\\rho^+$\nmeson. Our formalism is based on the point-form of relativistic quantum\nmechanics. Electron-$\\rho$-meson scattering is formulated as a coupled-channel\nproblem for a Bakamjian-Thomas mass operator, such that the dynamics of the\nexchanged photon is taken explicitly into account. The $\\rho$-meson current is\nextracted from on-shell matrix elements of the optical potential of the\nscattering process. As a consequence of the violation of cluster separability\nin the Bakamjian-Thomas framework, our current includes additional, unphysical\ncontributions, which can be separated from the physical ones uniquely. Our\nresults for the form factors are in good agreement with other approaches.\n", "  Recently, the $\\gamma$-ray emission at MeV and GeV energies from the object\nLMC P3 in the Large Magellanic Cloud has been discovered to be modulated with a\n10.3-days period, making it the first extra-galactic $\\gamma$-ray binary. This\nwork aims at the detection of TeV $\\gamma$-ray and the search for modulation of\nthe signal with the orbital period of the binary system. The H.E.S.S. data set\nhas been folded with the known orbital period of the system in order to test\nfor variability of the emission. Energy spectra are obtained for the\norbit-averaged data set and for orbital phases in which the TeV flux is found\nat its maximum. TeV $\\gamma$-ray emission is detected with a statistical\nsignificance of 6.4\\,$\\sigma$. The data clearly show variability which is\nphase-locked to the orbital period of the system. Periodicity cannot be deduced\nfrom the H.E.S.S. data set alone. The orbit-averaged luminosity in the 1-10 TeV\nenergy range is $(1.4 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^{35}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s}^{-1}$. A\nluminosity of $(5 \\pm 1) \\times 10^{35}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s}^{-1}$ is reached\nduring 20% of the orbit, when the MeV/GeV emission is at its minimum.\n", "  We study two nonets of excited vector mesons, predominantly corresponding to\nradially excited vector mesons with quantum numbers $n\\hspace{0.08cm}\n^{2S+1}L_{J}$ $=2^3S_1$ and to orbitally excited vector mesons with quantum\nnumbers $n\\hspace{0.08cm} ^{2S+1}L_{J}=1^3D_1$. We evaluate two types of decays\nof these mesons: into two pseudoscalar mesons and into a pseudoscalar and a\nground-state vector meson. We compare the results with experimental data taken\nfrom PDG. We also make predictions for the strange-antistrange state in the\n$1^3D_1$ nonet denoted as $\\phi(1930)$, which has not yet been discovered.\n", "  We study a new example of lattice equation being one of the key equations of\na recent generalized symmetry classification of five-point\ndifferential-difference equations. This equation has two different continuum\nlimits which are the well-known fifth order partial-differential equations,\nnamely, the Sawada-Kotera and Kaup-Kupershmidt equations. We justify its\nintegrability by constructing an $L-A$ pair and a hierarchy of conservation\nlaws.\n", "  With the shenfun Python module (github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun) an effort is\nmade towards automating the implementation of the spectral Galerkin method for\nsimple tensor product domains, consisting of (currently) one non-periodic and\nany number of periodic directions. The user interface to shenfun is\nintentionally made very similar to FEniCS (fenicsproject.org). Partial\nDifferential Equations are represented through weak variational forms and\nsolved using efficient direct solvers where available. MPI decomposition is\nachieved through the {mpi4py-fft} module (bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py-fft), and\nall developed solver may, with no additional effort, be run on supercomputers\nusing thousands of processors. Complete solvers are shown for the linear\nPoisson and biharmonic problems, as well as the nonlinear and time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equation.\n", "  The scattering of a wave obeying Helmholtz equation by an elliptic obstacle\ncan be described exactly using series of Mathieu functions. This situation is\nrelevant in optics, quantum mechanics and fluid dynamics. We focus on the case\nwhen the wavelength is comparable to the obstacle size, when the most standard\napproximations fail. The approximations of the radial (or modified) Mathieu\nfunctions using WKB method are shown to be especially efficient, in order to\nprecisely evaluate series of such functions. It is illustrated with the\nnumerical computation of the Green function when the wave is scattered by a\nsingle slit or a strip (ribbon).\n", "  We examine the recently introduced idea of Spin-Field Correspondence focusing\non the example of the spin system described by the XXZ Heisenberg model with\nexternal magnetic field. The Hamiltonian of the resulting nonlinear scalar\nfield theory is derived for arbitrary value of the anisotropy parameter\n$\\Delta$. We show that the linear scalar field theory is reconstructed in the\nlarge spin limit. For $\\Delta=1$ a non-relativistic scalar field theory\nsatisfying the Born reciprocity principle is recovered. As expected, for the\nvanishing anisotropy parameter $\\Delta \\rightarrow 0$ the standard relativistic\nKlein-Gordon field is obtained. Various aspects of the obtained class of the\nscalar fields are studied, including the fate of the relativistic symmetries\nand the properties of the emerging interaction terms. We show that, in a\ncertain limit, the so-called polymer quantisation of the field variables is\nrecovered. This and other discussed properties suggest a possible relevance of\nthe considered framework in the context of quantum gravity.\n", "  A brief introduction to the Standard-Model Extension (SME) approach to\ntesting CPT and Lorentz symmetry is provided. Recent proposals for tests with\nantimatter are summarized, including gravitational and spectroscopic tests.\n", "  We consider the support of the limit distribution of the Grover walk on\ncrystal lattices with the linear scaling. The orbit of the Grover walk is\ndenoted by the parametric plot of the pseudo-velocity of the Grover walk in the\nwave space. The region of the orbit is the support of the limit distribution.\nIn this paper, we compute the regions of the orbits for the triangular,\nhexagonal and kagome lattices. We show every outer frame of the support is\ndescribed by an ellipse. The shape of the ellipse depends only on the\nrealization of the fundamental lattice of the crystal lattice in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n", "  We consider inflation as an effective field theory and study the effects of\nthe addition to the Lagrangian of irrelevant operators with higher powers of\nfirst derivatives on its dynamics and observables. We find that significant\ndeviations from the two-derivative dynamics are possible within the regime of\nvalidity of the effective field theory. Focusing on monomial potentials we show\nthat the main effect of the terms under consideration is to reduce the speed of\nsound thereby reducing the tensor fraction, while having little impact on the\nscalar tilt. Crucially, these effects can arise even when the UV cut-off is\nwell above the inflationary Hubble parameter.\n", "  In cryptography, block ciphers are the most fundamental elements in many\nsymmetric-key encryption systems. The Cipher Block Chaining, denoted CBC,\npresents one of the most famous mode of operation that uses a block cipher to\nprovide confidentiality or authenticity. In this research work, we intend to\nsummarize our results that have been detailed in our previous series of\narticles. The goal of this series has been to obtain a complete topological\nstudy of the CBC block cipher mode of operation after proving his chaotic\nbehavior according to the reputed definition of Devaney.\n", "  We study the Vladimirov fractional differentiation operator $D^\\alpha_N$,\n$\\alpha >0, N\\in \\mathbb Z$, on a $p$-adic ball $B_N=\\{ x\\in \\mathbb Q_p:\\\n|x|_p\\le p^N\\}$. To its known interpretations via restriction from a similar\noperator on $\\mathbb Q_p$ and via a certain stochastic process on $B_N$, we add\nan interpretation as a pseudo-differential operator in terms of the Pontryagin\nduality on the additive group of $B_N$. We investigate the Green function of\n$D^\\alpha_N$ and a nonlinear equation on $B_N$, an analog the classical porous\nmedium equation.\n", "  The solar limb darkening function is well known and is widely employed in\nmodels of the solar atmosphere. However, there has been a lack of systematic\nspectrally resolved measurements. Therefore we recently decided to start an\nobserving campaign with the Gregory Coud\\'e Telescope at IRSOL in Locarno in\norder to produce a spectral atlas obtained at 10 different heliocentric angles\n$\\theta$, chosen so that $\\mu = \\cos\\theta$ covers the interval from 0.1 to 1.0\nin step of 0.1. The measurements carried out till now include the spectral\nrange from 439 nm to 666 nm. The collected data provide information about the\nanisotropy of the emergent radiation field on the solar surface, allowing a\nbetter modeling of the Second Solar Spectrum. In addition the data give\nobservational constraints that should be taken into account when modeling the\nsolar atmosphere.\n", "  It is often observed that martensitic microstructures in adjacent polycrystal\ngrains are related. For example, micrographs of Arlt exhibit propagation of\nlayered structures across grain boundaries in the cubic-to-tetragonal phase\ntransformation in $\\rm BaTiO_3$. Such observations are related to requirements\nof compatibility of the deformation at the grain boundary. Using a\ngeneralization of the Hadamard jump condition, this is explored in the\nnonlinear elasticity model of martensitic transformations for the case of a\nbicrystal with suitably oriented columnar geometry, in which the microstructure\nin both grains is assumed to involve just two martensitic variants, with a\nplanar or non-planar interface between the grains.\n", "  Using the latest global determination of neutrino oscillation parameters\nfrom~\\cite{deSalas:2017kay} we examine the status of the simplest revamped\nversion of the BMV (Babu-Ma-Valle) model, proposed in~\\cite{Morisi:2013qna}.\nThe model predicts a striking correlation between the \"poorly determined\"\natmospheric angle $\\theta_{23}$ and CP phase $\\delta_{CP}$, leading to either\nmaximal CP violation or none, depending on the preferred $\\theta_{23}$ octants.\nWe determine the allowed BMV parameter regions and compare with the general\nthree-neutrino oscillation scenario. We show that in the BMV model the higher\noctant is possible only at $99\\%$ C.L., a stronger rejection than found in the\ngeneral case. By performing quantitative simulations of forthcoming DUNE and\nT2HK experiments, using only the four \"well-measured\" oscillation parameters\nand the indication for normal mass ordering, we also map out the potential of\nthese experiments to corner the model. The resulting global sensitivities are\ngiven in a robust form, that holds irrespective of the true values of the\noscillation parameters.\n", "  Trigonometric parallaxes measured with ground-based telescopes of the RECONS\nconsortium as part of the CTIOPI program are used to search for stars that have\neither had an encounter with the solar system in the past or will have such an\nencounter in the future, at distances of less than a few parsecs. These are\nmainly low-mass dwarfs and subdwarfs of types M, L, and T currently at\ndistances of less than 30 pc from the Sun. Six stars for which encounters with\nthe solar orbit at distances of less than 1 pc are possible have been\nidentified for the first time. For example, the minimum distance for the star\n**SOZ 3A will 0.72+/- 0.11 pc at an epoch of 103+/-44 thousand years in the\nfuture.\n", "  In this paper, we calculate the superconducting critical temperature as a\nfunction of pressure, Tc(P ), using a method based on the functional derivative\nof the critical temperature with the Eliashberg function, dTc/dA2F. The coulomb\nelectron-electron repulsion parameter, mu*(p) at each pressure is obtained in a\nconsistent way by solving the linearized Migdal-Eliashberg equation. This\nmethod requires as the starting input only the knowledge of Tc(P ) at the\nstarting pressure. It applies to superconductors for which the\nMigdal-Eliashberg equations hold. We study Al, a typical BCS weak coupling\nsuperconductor with a low Tc . Our results of Tc(P ) as a function of pressure\nfor Al show an excellent agreement with the calculations of Profeta et al.\n(Phys. Rev. Lett.96, 047003 (2006)) which agree well with experiment.\n", "  Separable coordinate systems are introduced in the complex and real\nfour-dimensional flat spaces. We use maximal Abelian subgroups to generate\ncoordinate systems with a maximal number of ignorable variables. The results\nare presented (also graphically) in terms of subgroup chains. Finally, the\nexplicit solutions of the Schr\\H{o}dinger equation in the separable coordinate\nsystems are computed.\n", "  Maximal abelian subalgebras of one of the classical real inhomogeneous Lie\nalgebras are constructed, namely those of the pseudoeuclidean Lie algebra\ne(p,q). Use is made of the semidirect sum structure of e(p,q) with the\ntranslations T(p+q) as an abelian ideal. We first construct splitting MASAs\nthat are themselves direct sums of abelian subalgebras of o(p,q) and of\nsubalgebras of T(p+q). The splitting subalgebras are used to construct the\ncomplementary nonsplitting ones. We present general decomposition theorems and\nconstruct indecomposable MASAs for all algebras e(p,q), p \\geq q \\geq 0. The\ncase of q=0 and 1 were treated earlier in a physical context. The case q=2 is\nanalyzed here in detail as an illustration of the general results.\n", "  The maximal Abelian subalgebras of the Euclidean e(p,0) and pseudoeuclidean\ne(p,1)Lie algebras are classified into conjugacy classes under the action of\nthe corresponding Lie groups E(p,0) and E(p,1), and also under the conformal\ngroups O(p+1,1) and O(p+1,2), respectively. The results are presented in terms\nof decomposition theorems. For e(p,0) orthogonally indecomposable MASAs exist\nonly for p=1 and p=2. For e(p,1), on the other hand, orthogonally\nindecomposable MASAs exist for all values of p. The results are used to\nconstruct new coordinate systems in which wave equations and Hamilton-Jacobi\nequations allow the separation of variables.\n", "  We suggest that atoms undergoing Bragg deflection from a cavity field\nintroduce entanglement between their external degrees of freedom. The atoms\ninteract with an electromagnetic cavity field which is far detuned from atomic\ntransition frequency and is in superposition state. We provide a set of\nexperimental parameters in order to perform the suggested experiment within the\nframe work of the presently available technology.\n", "  We suggest a quantum nondemolition scheme to measure a quantized cavity field\nstate using scattering of atoms in general Bragg regime. Our work extends the\nQND measurement of a cavity field from Fock state, based on first order Bragg\ndeflection [9], to any quantum state based on Bragg deflection of arbitrary\norder. In addition a set of experimental parameters is provided to perform the\nexperiment within the frame work of the presently available technology.\n", "  We use the methods of group theory to reduce the equations of motion of two\nspin systems in (2+1) dimensions to sets of coupled ordinary differential\nequations. We present solutions of some classes of these sets and discuss their\nphysical significance.\n"]}
