Standard Model can lead to extra matter effects on\nneutrino oscillation if the new interactions distinguish among the three\nflavors of neutrino. In Ref.1, we argued that a long-baseline neutrino\noscillation experiment in which the Fermilab-NUMI beam in its high-energy mode\nis aimed at the planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector would be capable of\nconstraining the size of those extra matter effects, provided the vacuum value\nof \\sin^2 2\\theta_{23} is not too close to one. In this talk, we discuss how\nsuch a constraint would translate into limits on the coupling constants and\nmasses of new particles in models such as topcolor assisted technicolor.\n", "  In the gauge-Higgs unification scenario the 4D Higgs field is identified with\nthe zero mode of the extra-dimensional component of gauge potentials. The mass\nof the Higgs particle in the unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped\nspacetime is predicted to be in the range 100 GeV - 300 GeV. The WWZ gauge\ncouplings remains almost universal as in the standard model, but substantial\ndeviation results for the Higgs couplings. The WWH and ZZH couplings are\nsuppressed by a factor \\cos \\theta_H from the values in the standard model,\nwhere \\theta_H is the Yang-Mills AB phase along the fifth dimension. These can\nbe tested at LHC and ILC.\n", "  We study a five dimensional nonsupersymmetric SU(3) gauge theory compactified\non $M^4\\times S^1/Z_2$. The gauge hierarchy is discussed in the scenario of the\ngauge-Higgs unification. We present two models in which the large gauge\nhierarchy is realized, that is, the weak scale is naturally is obtained from an\nunique large scale such as a GUT and the Planck scale. We also study the Higgs\nmass in each model.\n", "  Dick Dalitz produced lasting contributions to particle physics for 50 years.\nAlong with Dalitz pairs, Dalitz plots and CDD poles, he did major work in\nparity violation, hyperon resonance identification, the quark model, and\nhypernuclei. These topics will be summarized, with some emphasis on the\nauthor's collaboration with Dalitz on quark spin and fragmentation\ncorrelations, and, particularly, the work on the identification of the top\nquark and its mass. Short biographical information is interspersed. This paper\nis based on a presentation at the International School of Subnuclear Physics,\nErice 2006.\n", "  We propose a dynamical scenario beyond the standard model, in which the\nradiative correction to the Higgs mass parameter is suppressed due to a large\nanomalous dimension induced through a conformal invariant coupling with an\nextra gauge sector. Then the anomalous dimension also suppresses the Yukawa\ncouplings of the Higgs field. However, the large top Yukawa coupling can be\ngenerated effectively through mixing among top quarks and the fermions of the\nconformal gauge sector. This scenario is found to predict a fairly heavy Higgs\nmass of about 500 GeV. We present an explicit model and show consistency with\nthe Electro-Weak precision measurements of the S and T parameters as well as\nthe Z boson decay width.\n", "  We present recent results on charmless hadronic B decays using data collected\nby the BaBar detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- collider at the\nStanford Linear Accelerator Center. We report measurements of branching\nfractions and charge asymmetries in several charmless two-body, three-body, and\nquasi-two-body decay modes. We also report measurements of polarization in\ncharmless B decays to exclusive final states with two vector mesons.\n", "  The mutual relation between quantum Micro and classical Macro is clarified by\na unified formulation of instruments describing measurement processes and the\nassociated amplification processes, from which some perspective towards a\ndescription of emergence processes of spacetime structure is suggested.\n", "  We present recent results of hadronic B meson decays related to the CKM angle\nbeta. The data used were collected by the BABAR detector at the pepII\nasymmetric-energy e+e- collider operating at the Upsilon(4S) resonance located\nat the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.\n", "  A high precision search for direct CP-violation in K+- --> 3 pi decays was\nperformed by the NA48/2 experiment at CERN SPS. The asymmetry in the Dalitz\nplot linear slopes A_g = (g^+ - g^-)/(g^+ + g^-) is measured to be A^c_g =\n(-1.3 +- 2.3)x10^-4 by studying ~3.1x10^9 K+- --> pi+- pi+ pi- decays and A^n_g\n= (2.1 +- 1.9)x10^-4 by studying ~91x10^6 K+- --> pi+- pi0 pi0 decays. The\nunique double- beam system, the design of the detectors and the method of\nanalysis provide good control of the instrumental charge asymmetries and allow\nto keep the precision of the result limited by statistics, reaching accuracy\none order of magnitude better than in previous experiments.\n", "  Non-Markovian reduced dynamics of an open system is investigated. In the case\nthe initial state of the reservoir is the vacuum state, an approximation is\nintroduced which makes possible to construct a reduced dynamics which is\ncompletely positive.\n", "  We summarize the status of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in galaxy\nclusters. The observed acceleration is typically larger than the acceleration\nthreshold of MOND in the central regions, implying that some dark matter is\nnecessary to explain the mass discrepancy there. A plausible resolution of this\nissue is that the unseen mass in MOND is in the form of ordinary neutrinos with\nmasses just below the experimentally detectable limit. In particular, we show\nthat the lensing mass reconstructions of the clusters 1E0657-56 (the bullet\ncluster) and Cl0024+17 (the ring) do not pose a new challenge to this scenario.\nHowever, the mass discrepancy for cool X-ray emitting groups, in which\nneutrinos cannot cluster, pose a more serious problem, meaning that dark\nbaryons could present a more satisfactory solution to the problem of unseen\nmass in MOND clusters.\n", "  We present recent measurements of the CKM angles alpha and gamma using data\ncollected by the BaBar detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+ e- collider\nat the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. In addition to constraints on alpha\nfrom the decays B0 -> pi+ pi-, B0 -> rho+ pi- and B0 -> rho+ rho-, we also\nreport the first measurement of time-dependent CP asymmetries in the decay B0\n-> a1+(1260) pi-. We present measurements of gamma in B+ -> D(*)0 K+ decays\nusing a Dalitz analysis in the modes D^0 -> Ks pi+ pi- and D^0 -> pi+ pi- pi0.\n", "  The formation of macroscopic reconnected magnetic structures (islands) have\nbeen observed in advanced experiments on weakly collisional, well confined\nplasmas while established theories of the drift-tearing modes, which depend\nstrongly on the electron temperature gradient and can describe the formation of\nthese structures, had predicted practically inaccessible excitation thresholds\nfor them in these regimes. The relevant theoretical dilemma is resolved as\nmesoscopic modes that depend critically on the ratio of the transverse (to the\nmagnetic field) to the longitudinal thermal\nconductivity${D^e_{\\perp}/D^e_{\\|}$, can produce large scale magnetic\nreconnection. These modes are envisioned to emerge from a background, which can\nbe coherent, of collisionless microscopic reconnecting modes driven by the\nelectron temperature gradient, that create a sequence of adjacent strings of\nmagnetic islands and increase considerably the ratio ${D^e_{\\perp}/D^e_{\\|}$\nover its classical value. The mesoscopic reconnecting mode is treated by a\nsingular perturbation analysis involving three asymptotic regions and the small\nparameters ${(D^e_{\\perp}/D^e_{\\|})}^{1/4}$ and ${\\epsilon}^{1/4}_{*}$, where\n${\\epsilon}_{*} {\\equiv}D_m/D_A$, $D_m$ is the magnetic diffusion coefficient,\n$D_A\\sim\\texttt{v}^{2}_{A}r_{Te}/(D_Bk_{\\perp})$,\n$r_{Te}\\equiv(-d\\texttt{ln}T_e/dr)^{-1}$, $k_{\\perp}$ is the transverse mode\nnumber, $\\texttt{v}^{2}_{A}=B^{2}/(4\\pi{nm}_{i})}$ and $D_B=cT_e/(eB)$.\n", "  We consider the phenomenological consequences of a hidden Higgs sector\nextending the Standard Model (SM), in which the matter content are uncharged\nunder the SM gauge groups. We consider a simple case where the hidden sector is\ngauged under a U(1) with one Higgs singlet. The only couplings between SM and\nthe hidden sector are through mixings between the neutral gauge bosons of the\ntwo respective sectors, and between the Higgs bosons. We find signals testable\nat the LHC that can reveal the existence and shed light on the nature of such a\nhidden sector.\n", "  We propose a simple scheme to swap the non local correlations, characteristic\nof a Franson interferometric setup, between pairs of frequency entangled\nphotons emitted by distinct non linear crystals in a parametric down conversion\nprocess. Our scheme consists of two distinct sources of frequency entangled\nphotons. One photon of each pair is sent to a separate Mach - Zender\ninterferometer while the other photons of the pairs are mixed by a beam\nsplitter and then detected in a Ou - Mandel interferometer. For suitably\npostselected joint measuremetns, the photons sent at the Mach -Zender show a\ncoincidence photocount statistics which depends non locally on the settings of\nthe two interferometers.\n", "  We call \"projectile fragmentation\" of neutron halo nuclei the elastic breakup\n(diffraction) reaction, when the observable studied is the neutron-core\nrelative energy spectrum. This observable has been measured in relation to the\nCoulomb breakup on heavy target and recently also on light targets. Such data\nenlighten the effect of the neutron final state interaction with the core of\norigin. Projectile fragmentation is studied here by a time dependent model for\nthe excitation of a nucleon from a bound state to a continuum resonant state in\na neutron-core complex potential which acts as a final state interaction.\n  The final state is described by an optical model S-matrix so that both\nresonant and non resonant states of any continuum energy can be studied as well\nas deeply bound initial states. It turns out that due to the coupling between\nthe initial and final states, the neutron-core free particle phase shifts are\nmodified, in the exit channel, by an additional phase.\n  Some typical numerical calculations for the relevant observables are\npresented and compared to experimental data. It is suggest that the excitation\nenergy spectra of an unbound nucleus might reflect the structure of the parent\nnucleus from whose fragmentation they are obtained.\n", "  I discuss low energy searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model,\nidentifying the role played by chiral symmetries in these searches and in\nvarious new physics scenarios. I focus in particular on electric dipole moment\nsearches; precision studies of weak decays and electron scattering; and\nneutrino properties and interactions.\n", "  We extend the 1/N_c meson-baryon scattering formalism to pi N to multi-pi N\ncase. We first show that the leading-order large N_c processes proceed through\nresonant intermediate states (e.g., rho N or pi Delta). We find that the pole\nstructure of baryon resonances can be uniquely identified by their\n(non)appearance in eta N or mixed partial-wave pi Delta final states.\n", "  The systematic treatment of heavy quark mass effects in DIS in current CTEQ\nglobal analysis is summarized. Applications of this treatment to the comparison\nbetween theory and experimental data on DIS charm production are described. The\npossibility of intrinsic charm in the nucleon is studied. The issue of\ndetermining the charm mass in global analysis is discussed.\n", "  A brief review of the discovery potential of the ATLAS and CMS experiments to\nsearch for signals from extra dimensions in different luminosity scenarios is\ngiven.\n", "  The nature of the main constituents of the mass of the universe is one of the\noutstanding riddles of cosmology and astro-particle physics. Current models\nexplaining the evolution of the universe, and measurements of the various\ncomponents of its mass, all have in common that an appreciable contribution to\nthat mass is non-luminous and non-baryonic, and that a large fraction of this\nso-called dark matter must be in the form of non-relativistic massive particles\n(Cold Dark Matter: CDM). In the spirit of the Lake Louise Winter Institute\nLectures we take a look at the latest astronomical discoveries and report on\nthe status of direct and indirect Dark Matter searches.\n", "  When a quantum many-particle system exists on a randomly diluted lattice, its\nintrinsic thermal and quantum fluctuations coexist with geometric fluctuations\ndue to percolation. In this paper, we explore how the interplay of these\nfluctuations influences the phase transition at the percolation threshold.\nWhile it is well known that thermal fluctuations generically destroy long-range\norder on the critical percolation cluster, the effects of quantum fluctuations\nare more subtle. In diluted quantum magnets with and without dissipation, this\nleads to novel universality classes for the zero-temperature percolation\nquantum phase transition. Observables involving dynamical correlations display\nnonclassical scaling behavior that can nonetheless be determined exactly in two\ndimensions.\n", "  The GSI1, GSI2 (as well as the RIKEN2 and the corrected GSI2) measurements of\nthe Coulomb Dissociation (CD) of 8B are in good agreement with the most recent\nDirect Capture (DC) 7Be(p,g)8B reaction measurement performed at Weizmann and\nin agreement with the Seattle result. Yet it was claimed that the CD and DC\nresults are sufficiently different and need to be reconciled. We show that\nthese statements arise from a misunderstanding (as well as misrepresentation)\nof CD experiments. We recall a similar strong statement questioning the\nvalidity of the CD method due to an invoked large E2 component that was also\nshown to arise from a misunderstanding of the CD method. In spite of the good\nagreement between DC and CD data the slope of the astrophysical cross section\nfactor (S17) can not be extracted with high accuracy due to a discrepancy\nbetween the recent DC data as well as a discrepancy of the three reports of the\nGSI CD data. The slope is directly related to the d-wave component that\ndominates at higher energies and must be subtracted from measured data to\nextrapolate to zero energy. Hence the uncertainty of the measured slope leads\nto an additional uncertainty of the extrapolated zero energy cross section\nfactor, S17(0). This uncertainty must be alleviated by future experiments to\nallow a precise determination of S17(0), a goal that so far has not be achieved\nin spite of strong statement(s) that appeared in the literature.\n", "  The structures, the electromagnetic transitions, and the beta decay strengths\nof exotic nuclei are investigated within an extended cluster model. We start by\nderiving an effective nuclear Hamiltonian within the $S_2$ correlation\noperator. Tensor forces are introduced in a perturbative expansion which\nincludes up to the second order terms. Within this Hamiltonian we calculate the\ndistributions and the radii of A=3,~4 nuclei. For exotic nuclei characterized\nby n valence protons/neutrons we excite the structure of the closed shell\nnuclei via mixed modes formed by considering correlations operators of higher\norder. Good results have been obtained for the calculated transitions and for\nthe beta decay transition probabilities.\n", "  We have investigated the ground state properties of solid $^4$He with the\nShadow Path Integral Ground State method. This exact T=0 K projector method\nallows to describes quantum solids without introducing any a priori equilibrium\nposition. We have found that the efficiency in computing off-diagonal\nproperties in the solid phase sensibly improves when the direct sampling of\npermutations, in principle not required, is introduced. We have computed the\nexact one-body density matrix (obdm) in large commensurate 4He crystal finding\na decreasing condensate fraction with increasing imaginary time of projection,\nmaking our result not conclusive on the presence of Bose-Einstein condensation\nin bulk solid 4He. We can only give an upper bound of 2.5 times 10^-8 on the\ncondensate fraction. We have exploited the SPIGS method to study also 4He\ncrystal containing grain boundaries by computing the related surface energy and\nthe obdm along these defects. We have found that also highly symmetrical grain\nboundaries have a finite condensate fraction. We have also derived a route for\nthe estimation of the true equilibrium concentration of vacancies x_v in bulk\nT=0 K solid 4He, which is shown to be finite, x_v=0.0014(1) at the melting\ndensity, when computed with the variational shadow wave function technique.\n", "  The ground-state phase properties of a two-dimensional Bose system with\ndipole-dipole interactions is studied by means of quantum Monte Carlo\ntechniques. Limitations of mean-field theory in a two-dimensional geometry are\ndiscussed. A quantum phase transition from gas to solid is found. Crystal is\ntested for existence of a supersolid in the vicinity of the phase transition.\nExistence of mesoscopic analogue of the off-diagonal long-range order is shown\nin the one-body density matrix in a finite-size crystal. Non-zero superfluid\nfraction is found in a finite-size crystal, the signal being dramatically\nincreased in presence of vacancies.\n", "  Non-critical string cosmologies may be viewed as the analogue of\noff-equilibrium models arising within string theory as a result of a cosmically\ncatastrophic event in the early Universe. Such models entail relaxing-to-zero\ndark energies provided by a rolling dilaton field at late times. We discuss\nfits of such non-critical models to high-redshift supernovae data, including\nthe recent ones by HST and ESSENCE and compare the results with those of a\nconventional model with Cold Dark Matter and a cosmological constant and a\nmodel invoking super-horizon perturbations.\n", "  In these Lectures I review possible constraints on particle physics models,\nobtained by means of combining the results of collider measurements with\nastrophysical data. I emphasize the theoretical-model dependence of these\nresults. I discuss supersymmetric dark matter constraints at colliders (mainly\nLHC) in various theoretical contexts: the standard\nCosmological-Constant-Cold-Dark-Matter (Lambda-CDM) model,\n(super)string-inspired ones and non-equilibrium relaxation dark energy models.\nI then investigate the capability of LHC measurements in asserting whether\nsupersymmetric matter (if discovered) constitutes part, or all, of the\nastrophysical dark matter. I also discuss prospects for improving the\nconstraints in future precision facilities, such as the International Linear\nCollider.\n", "  By means of a technique, which does not employ partial wave (PW)\ndecompositions, the nucleon-deuteron break-up process is evaluated in the\nFaddeev scheme, where only the leading order term of the amplitude is\nconsidered. This technique is then applied to calculate the semi-exclusive\nproton-deuteron break-up reaction d(p,n)pp for proton laboratory energies Elab\nof a few hundred MeV. A comparison with PW calculations is performed at 197 MeV\nprojectile energy. At the same energy rescattering processes, which are not\nincluded in the 3D calculations yet, are shown to be still important in the\nfull Faddeev PW calculations, especially for the cross section and the\nanalyzing power Ay. Next, kinematical relativistic effects are investigated for\nprojectile energies up to about 500 MeV. At the higher energies, those\nrelativistic effects start not to be negligible, especially in the peak of the\ncross section.\n", "  Microscopic studies of nuclear matter under diverse conditions of density and\nasymmetry are of great contemporary interest. Concerning terrestrial\napplications, they relate to future experimental facilities that will make it\npossible to study systems with extreme neutron-to-proton ratio. In this talk, I\nwill review recent efforts of my group aimed at exploring nuclear interactions\nin the medium through the nuclear equation of state (EoS). The approach we take\nis microscopic and relativistic, with the predicted EoS properties derived from\nrealistic nucleon-nucleon potentials. I will also discuss work in progress.\nMost recently, we completed a DBHF calculation of the $\\Lambda$ hyperon binding\nenergy in nuclear matter.\n", "  The two-proton knockout reaction 9Be(26Ne,O2p) was used to explore excited\nunbound states of 23O and 24O. In 23O a state at an excitation energy of\n2.79(13) MeV was observed. There was no conclusive evidence for the population\nof excited states in 24O.\n", "  I discuss the relation between inclusive and exclusive dynamics suggested by\nBloom-Gilman duality. Duality implies the simultaneous applicability of two\ndistinct limits, the standard DIS limit of hard inclusive processes taken at\nfixed xB and a limit where the hadronic mass is held fixed. I review\nexperimental evidence for the relevance of the fixed mass limit in inclusive\nprocesses at high xF. Semi-local duality suggests that inclusive and exclusive\nprocesses occur on the same target Fock states. DIS scaling then implies that\nthe Fock states contributing to hard exclusive processes have a large\ntransverse size, i.e., that the hard scattering occurs off a single parton\nwhich carries a large fraction of the hadron momentum.\n", "  This paper summarizes our recent progress towards using single rubidium atoms\ntrapped in an optical tweezer to encode quantum information. We demonstrate\nsingle qubit rotations on this system and measure the coherence of the qubit.\nWe move the quantum bit over distances of tens of microns and show that the\ncoherence is reserved. We also transfer a qubit atom between two tweezers and\nshow no loss of coherence. Finally, we describe our progress towards\nconditional entanglement of two atoms by photon emission and two-photon\ninterferences.\n", "  The role of Pauli potentials in the semiclassical simulation of Fermi gases\nat low temperatures is investigated. An alternative Pauli potential to the\nusual bivariate Gaussian form by Dorso et al. is proposed. This new Pauli\npotential allows for a simultaneous good reproduction of not only the kinetic\nenergy per particle but also the momentum distribution and the two-body\ncorrelation function. The reproduction of the binding energies in finite nuclei\nin the low and medium mass range is also analyzed. What is found is that given\na reasonable short-range atractive nuclear interaction one can include\ncorrelation effects in a suitable chosen density dependent Pauli potential.\n", "  We propose a physically motivated parametrization for the unpolarized\ngeneralized parton distributions, H and E, valid at both zero and non-zero\nvalues of the skewness variable, \\zeta. At \\zeta=0, H and E are determined\nusing constraints from simultaneous fits of experimental data on both the\nnucleon elastic form factors and the deep inelastic structure functions.\nLattice calculations of the higher moments constrain the parametrization at\n\\zeta > 0. Our method provides a step towards a model independent extraction of\ngeneralized distributions from the data that is alternative to the mathematical\nansatz of double distributions.\n", "  Dyson published in 1990 a proof due to Feynman of the Maxwell equations. This\nproof is based on the assumption of simple commutation relations between\nposition and velocity. We first study a nonrelativistic particle using Feynman\nformalism. We show that Poincar\\'{e}'s magnetic angular momentum and Dirac\nmagnetic monopole are the direct consequences of the structure of the sO(3) Lie\nalgebra in Feynman formalism. Then we show how to extend this formalism to the\ndual momentum space with the aim of introducing Noncommutative Quantum\nMechanics which was recently the subject of a wide range of works from particle\nphysics to condensed matter physics.\n", "  The radiative $\\Delta \\to \\gamma N$ transition is examined at the real photon\npoint $Q^2=0$ using the framework of light-cone QCD sum rules. In particular,\nwe determine the sum rules for the transition form factors $G_M(0)$ and\n$R_{EM}$ up to twist 4.\n", "  This is a short presentation of the results for the pion-nucleon distribution\namplitudes which are expressed in terms of the nucleon distribution amplitudes\nwith the help of current algebra. Everything is considered to be at threshold.\n", "  The AdS/CFT correspondence between string theory in AdS space and conformal\nfield theories in physical space-time leads to an analytic, semi-classical\nmodel for strongly-coupled QCD which has scale invariance and dimensional\ncounting at short distances and color confinement at large distances. One can\nuse holography to map the amplitude describing the hadronic state in the fifth\ndimension of Anti-de Sitter space to the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons\nin physical space-time, thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons in\nQCD at the amplitude level. In particular, we show that there is an exact\ncorrespondence between the fifth-dimensional coordinate of AdS space z and a\nspecific impact variable zeta which measures the separation of the quark and\ngluonic constituents within the hadron in ordinary space-time. New relativistic\nlight-front equations in ordinary space-time can then be derived which\nreproduce the results obtained using the 5-dimensional theory. The effective\nlight-front equations possess elegant algebraic structures and integrability\nproperties. This connection between the AdS and the light-front representations\nallows one to compute the analytic form of the frame-independent light-front\nwavefunctions, the fundamental entities which encode hadron properties and\nallow the computation of decay constants, form factors, deeply virtual Compton\nscattering, exclusive heavy hadron decays and other exclusive scattering\namplitudes. As specific examples we compute the pion coupling constant and\nstudy the behavior of the pion form factor in the space and time-like regions.\nWe also determine the Dirac form factors of the proton and neutron in the\nspace-like region.\n", "  Initial-state and final-state interactions, which are conventionally\nneglected in the parton model, have a profound effect in QCD hard-scattering\nreactions. These effects, which arise from gluon exchange between the active\nand spectator quarks, cause leading-twist single-spin asymmetries, diffractive\ndeep inelastic scattering, diffractive hard hadronic reactions, and the\nbreakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions. Diffractive deep\ninelastic scattering also leads to nuclear shadowing and non-universal\nantishadowing of nuclear structure functions through multiple scattering\nreactions in the nuclear target. Factorization-breaking effects are\nparticularly important for hard hadron interactions since both initial-state\nand final-state interactions appear. Related factorization breaking effects can\nalso appear in exclusive electroproduction reactions and in deeply virtual\nCompton scattering. None of the effects of initial-state and final-state\ninteractions are incorporated in the light-front wavefunctions of the target\nhadron computed in isolation.\n", "  We consider pion electroproduction on a proton target close to threshold for\nQ^2 in the region 1-10 GeV^2. The momentum transfer dependence of the S-wave\nmultipoles at threshold, E_{0+} and L_{0+}, is calculated using light-cone sum\nrules.\n", "  We report the first observation of $e^+e^-$ annihilations into hadronic\nstates of positive $C$-parity, $\\rho^0 \\rho^0$ and $\\phi\\rho^0$. The angular\ndistributions support two-virtual-photon annihilation production. We also\nreport the observations of $e^+e^-\\to \\phi\\eta$ and a preliminary result on\n$e^+e^-\\to \\rho^+\\rho^-$.\n", "  We give a brief overview of the theoretical status of the Transition\nDistribution Amplitudes and discuss their experimental near future.\n", "  We relate disentanglement and decoherence rates in a pair of three-level\natoms subjected to multi-local and collective pure dephasing noise acting in a\npreferred basis. The bipartite entanglement decay rate, as bounded from above\nby the negativity, is found to be greater than or equal to the\ndephasing-decoherence rates characterized by the decay of off-diagonal elements\nin the corresponding full density matrix describing the system or the reduced\ndensity matrix describing either qutrit, extending previous results for qubit\npairs subject to such noise.\n", "  Several examples for the role of orbital angular momentum and spin-orbit\ncorrelations in hadron structure are discussed.\n", "  For more than three decades, the inner crust of neutron stars, formed of a\nsolid lattice of nuclear clusters coexisting with a gas of electrons and\nneutrons, has been traditionally studied in the Wigner-Seitz approximation. The\nvalidity of this approximation is discussed in the general framework of the\nband theory of solids, which has been recently applied to the nuclear context.\nUsing this novel approach, it is shown that the unbound neutrons move in the\ncrust as if their mass was increased.\n", "  Inclusive DIS with unpolarized beam exhibits a subtle dependence on the\ntransverse target spin, arising from the interference of one-photon and\ntwo-photon exchange amplitudes in the cross section. We argue that this\nobservable probes mainly the quark helicity-flip amplitudes induced by the\nnon-perturbative vacuum structure of QCD (spontaneous chiral symmetry\nbreaking). This conjecture is based on (a) the absence of significant Sudakov\nsuppression of the helicity-flip process if soft gluon emission in the quark\nsubprocess is limited by the chiral symmetry-breaking scale mu_chiral^2 >>\nLambda_QCD^2; (b) the expectation that the quark helicity-conserving twist-3\ncontribution is small. The normal target spin asymmetry is estimated to be of\nthe order 10^{-4} in the kinematics of the planned Jefferson Lab Hall A\nexperiment.\n", "  Advances in micro deformable mirror (DM) technologies such as MEMs, have\nstimulated interest in the characteristics of systems that include a high\nstroke mirror in series with a high actuator count mirror. This arrangement is\nreferred to as a woofer-tweeter system. In certain situations it may be\ndesirable or necessary to operate the woofer DM in open-loop. We present a\nsimple method for controlling a woofer DM in open loop provided the device\nbehaves in an approximately linear fashion. We have tested a mirror that we\nbelieve meets our criterion, the ALPAO DM52 mirror. Using our open-loop method\nwe fit several test Kolmogorov wavefronts with the mirror and have achieved an\naccuracy of approximately 25 nm rms surface deviation over the whole clear\naperture, and 20 nm rms over 90% of the aperture. We have also flattened the\nmirror in open loop to approximately 11 nm rms residual.\n", "  This article provides a concise review of selected topics in the many-body\nphysics of low density nuclear systems. The discussion includes the\ncondensation of alpha particles in supernova envelopes, formation of three-body\nbound states and the BEC-BCS crossover in dilute nuclear matter, and neutrino\nproduction in $S$-wave paired superfluid neutron matter.\n", "  The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), to be installed on the International\nSpace Station (ISS) in 2008, is a cosmic ray detector with several subsystems,\none of which is a proximity focusing Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector.\nThis detector will be equipped with a dual radiator (aerogel+NaF), a lateral\nconical mirror and a detection plane made of 680 photomultipliers and light\nguides, enabling precise measurements of particle electric charge and velocity.\nCombining velocity measurements with data on particle rigidity from the AMS\nTracker it is possible to obtain a measurement for particle mass, allowing the\nseparation of isotopes. A Monte Carlo simulation of the RICH detector, based on\nrealistic properties measured at ion beam tests, was performed to evaluate\nisotope separation capabilities. Results for three elements -- H (Z=1), He\n(Z=2) and Be (Z=4) -- are presented.\n", "  Lattice results on the N to Delta electromagnetic, axial-vector and\npseudoscalar form factors are evaluated using dynamical staggered sea quarks\nand domain wall valence quarks for pion masses in the range of 580-350 MeV, as\nwell as, dynamical and quenched Wilson fermions for similar pion masses.\n", "  We present the general relativistic calculation of the energy release\nassociated with a first order phase transition (PT) at the center of a rotating\nneutron star (NS). The energy release, E_rel, is equal to the difference in\nmass-energies between the initial (normal) phase configuration and the final\nconfiguration containing a superdense matter core, assuming constant total\nbaryon number and the angular momentum. The calculations are performed with the\nuse of precise pseudo-spectral 2-D numerical code; the polytropic equations of\nstate (EOS) as well as realistic EOSs (Skyrme interactions, Mean Field Theory\nkaon condensate) are used. The results are obtained for a broad range of\nmetastability of initial configuration and size of the new superdense phase\ncore in the final configuration. For a fixed ``overpressure'', dP, defined as\nthe relative excess of central pressure of a collapsing metastable star over\nthe pressure of the equilibrium first-order PT, the energy release up to\nnumerical accuracy does not depend on the stellar angular momentum and\ncoincides with that for nonrotating stars with the same dP. When the equatorial\nradius of the superdense phase core is much smaller than the equatorial radius\nof the star, analytical expressions for the E_rel can be obtained: E_rel is\nproportional to dP^2.5 for small dP. At higher dP, the results of 1-D\ncalculations of E_rel(dP) for non-rotating stars reproduce with very high\nprecision exact 2-D results for fast-rotating stars. The energy release-angular\nmomentum independence for a given overpressure holds also for the so-called\n``strong'' PTs (that destabilise the star against the axi-symmetric\nperturbations), as well as for PTs with ``jumping'' over the energy barrier.\n", "  This article contains a summary of the recent results in diffractive physics\nat the Tevatron. Results from the CDF diffraction program include the single\ndiffractive to non-diffractive ratio in dijet events, observation of exclusive\n$e^+e^-$ production via two-photon exchange, hints of exclusive $\\gamma\\gamma$\nproduction via Double Pomeron Exchange (DPE), and the observation of exclusive\ndijet production via DPE. A summary of the current plans for the D\\O\\\ndiffractive physics program is also presented.\n", "  We summarise applications of Dyson-Schwinger equations to the theory and\nphenomenology of hadrons. Some exact results for pseudoscalar mesons are\nhighlighted with details relating to the U_A(1) problem. We describe inferences\nfrom the gap equation relating to the radius of convergence for expansions of\nobservables in the current-quark mass. We recapitulate upon studies of nucleon\nelectromagnetic form factors, providing a comparison of the ln-weighted ratios\nof Pauli and Dirac form factors for the neutron and proton.\n", "  We show that the magnetization in color-flavor locked superconductors can be\nso strong that homogeneous quark matter becomes metastable for a wide range of\nmagnetic field values. This indicates that magnetic domains or other type of\nmagnetic inhomogeneities can be present in the quark cores of magnetars.\n", "  This paper is a review of a previous research on gravitational waves from the\nR^-1 high order theory of gravity. It is shown that a massive scalar mode of\ngravitational waves from the R^-1 theory generates a longitudinal force in\naddition of the transverse one which is proper of the massless gravitational\nwaves and the response of an arm of an interferometer to this longitudinal\neffect in the frame of a local observer is computed. Important conseguences\nfrom a theoretical point of view could arise from this approach, because it\nopens to the possibility of using the signals seen from interferometers to\nunderstand which is the correct theory of gravitation.\n", "  The various factorization schemes for hard exclusive processes and the status\nof their applications is briefly reviewed.\n", "  A track finding algorithm has been developed for reconstruction of e+e-\npairs. It combines the information of the electromagnetic calorimeter with the\ninformation provided by the Tracker. Results on reconstruction efficiency of\nconverted photons, as well as on fake rate are shown for single isolated\nphotons and for photons from H->gamma gamma events with pile-up events at 10^33\ncm^-2 s^-1 LHC luminosity.\n", "  The theory of nuclear forces has made great progress since the turn of the\nmillenium using the framework of chiral effective field theory (ChEFT). The\nadvantage of this approach, which was originally proposed by Weinberg, is that\nit has a firm basis in quantum-chromodynamics and allows for quantitative\ncalculations. Moreover, this theory generates two-nucleon forces (2NF) and\nmany-body forces on an equal footing and provides an explanation for the\nempirically known fact that 2NF >> 3NF >> 4NF. I will present the recent\nadvances in more detail and put them into historical context. In addition, I\nwill also provide a critical evaluation of the progress made including a\ndiscussion of the limitations of the ChEFT approach.\n", "  The Parity doublet model containing the SU(2) multiplets including the\nbaryons identified as the chiral partners of the nucleons is applied for\nneutron star matter. The chiral restoration is analyzed and the maximum mass of\nthe star is calculated.\n", "  I discuss the use of path integrals to study strong-interaction physics from\nfirst principles. The underlying theory is cast into path integrals which are\nevaluated numerically using Monte Carlo methods on a space-time lattice.\nExamples are given on progress related to nuclear physics.\n", "  The INTEGRAL satellite, which studies the Universe in the hard X-ray and soft\nGamma-ray domain, has been operational for 5 years now. The X-ray telescopes,\nwhich use the coded mask technique, provide unprecedented spectral and imaging\nresolution. This led to a number of discoveries, such as the distribution of\ndiffuse emission in the Galaxy, the discovery of highly absorbed sources and\nfast X-ray transients in the Galactic Plane, localization of ~50 Gamma-ray\nbursts, and the resolution of the cosmic X-ray background around its peak at 30\nkeV. About 300 previously known X-ray sources have been detected and in\naddition more than 200 new sources have been discovered. INTEGRAL provides\nspectra starting at 3 keV and ranging up to several hundred keV. This article\ngives a brief overview about the major discoveries of INTEGRAL.\n", "  We consider perturbations of Hamiltonians whose Fourier symbol attains its\nminimum along a hypersurface. Such operators arise in several domains, like\nspintronics, theory of supercondictivity, or theory of superfluidity.\nVariational estimates for the number of eigenvalues below the essential\nspectrum in terms of the perturbation potential are provided. In particular, we\nprovide an elementary proof that negative potentials lead to an infinite\ndiscrete spectrum.\n", "  Recent observations of XTE J1739-285 suggest that it contains a neutron star\nrotating at 1122 Hz. Such rotational frequency would be the first for which the\neffects of rotation are significant. We study the consequences of very fast\nrotating neutron stars for the potentially observable quantities as stellar\nmass and pulsar period.\n", "  In this contribution, the peculiarities of the behaviour of strange quark\nmatter in respect to ordinary ions in silicon are investigated, and a tentative\nto identify possible observable effects of degradation is made.\n", "  Non-Fermi liquid behavior of strongly correlated Fermi systems is derived\nwithin the Landau approach. We attribute this behavior to a phase transition\nassociated with a rearrangement of the Landau state that leads to flattening of\na portion of the single-particle spectrum $\\epsilon({\\bf p})$ in the vicinity\nof the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that the quasiparticle subsystem\nresponsible for the flat spectrum possesses the same thermodynamic properties\nas a gas of localized spins. Theoretical results compare favorably with\navailable experimental data. While departing radically from prevalent views on\nthe origin of non-Fermi-liquid behavior, the theory advanced here is\nnevertheless a conservative one of in continuing to operate within the general\nframework of Landau theory.\n", "  Recently, it has been shown that the standard Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model\nis not able to reproduce the correct QCD behavior of the gap equation at large\ndensity, and therefore a different cutoff procedure at large momenta has ben\nproposed. We found that, even with this density dependent cutoff procedure, the\npure quark phase in neutron stars (NS) interiors is unstable, and we argue that\nthis could be related to the lack of confinement in the original NJL model.\n", "  We outline the twist-two analysis of deeply virtual Compton scattering\n(DVCS)within the conformal partial wave expansion of the amplitude, represented\nas a Mellin--Barnes integral. The complete next-to-leading order results,\nincluding evolution, are obtained in the MS and a conformal factorization\nscheme. Within the latter, exploiting conformal symmetry, the radiative\ncorrections are evaluated up to next-to-next-to-leading order. Using a new\nproposed parameterization for GPDs, we study the convergence of perturbation\ntheory and demonstrate for H1 and ZEUS measurements that our formalism is\nsuitable for a fitting procedure of DVCS observables. We comment on a recent\nclaim of a breakdown of collinear factorization and show that a Regge-inspired\nQ^2 scaling law is ruled out by small x_Bj DVCS data.\n", "  Hard exclusive reactions are the tool to learn about generalized parton\ndistributions, which provide a more complete parametrization of the nucleon\nthan the ordinary parton distribution functions. Recent measurements by the\nHERMES collaboration of the exclusive production of photons, i.e.,\nDeeply-Virtual Compton Scattering, are summarized and compared to model\ncalculations, focusing on the measurements and model comparisons relevant to\nthe extraction of quark orbital angular momentum and on the measurements on\nheavy nuclei.\n", "  A sketch of a recent approach to quantum gravity is presented which involves\nseveral unconventional aspects. The basic ingredients include: (1) Affine\nkinematical variables; (2) Affine coherent states; (3) Projection operator\napproach for quantum constraints; (4) Continuous-time regularized functional\nintegral representation without/with constraints; and (5) Hard core picture of\nnonrenormalizability. Emphasis is given to the functional integral expressions.\n", "  In this paper, we calculate the stable Wigner-Seitz (W-S) cells in the inner\ncrust of neutron stars and we discuss the nuclear shell effects. A distinction\nis done between the shell effects due to the bound states and those induced by\nthe unbound states, which are shown to be spurious. We then estimate the\neffects of the spurious shells on the total energy and decompose it into a\nsmooth and a residual part. We propose a correction to the Hartree-Fock binding\nenergy in Wigner-Seitz cell (HF-WS).\n", "  The beam spin asymmetries of the reaction ep -> epg in the Bjorken regime\nwere measured over a wide kinematical domain using the CLAS detector and a new\nlead-tungstate calorimeter. Through the interference of the Bethe-Heitler\nprocess with Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering, those asymmetries provide\nconstraints for the nucleon Generalized Parton Distributions models. The\nobserved shapes are in agreement with twist-2 dominance predictions.\n", "  We consider modified dispersion relations in quantum field theory on curved\nspace-time. Such relations, despite breaking the local Lorentz invariance at\nhigh energy, are considered in several phenomenological approaches to quantum\ngravity. Their existence involves a modification of the formalism of quantum\nfield theory, starting from the problem of finding the scalar Green's functions\nup to the renormalization of various quantum expectation values. In this work\nwe consider a simple example of such modifications, in the case of ultra-static\nmetric. We show how to overcome the lack of Lorentz invariance by introducing a\npreferred frame, with respect to which we can express the Green's functions as\nan integral over all frequencies of a space-dependent function. The latter can\nbe expanded in momentum space, and by integrating over all frequencies, we\nfinally find the expansion of the Green's function up to four derivatives of\nthe metric tensor. The relation with the proper-time formalism is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Recent work has indicated that WIMP annihilation in stellar cores has the\npotential to contribute significantly to a star's total energy production. We\nreport on progress in simulating the effects of WIMP capture and annihilation\nupon stellar structure and evolution near supermassive black holes, using the\nnew DarkStars code. Preliminary results indicate that low-mass stars are the\nmost influenced by WIMP annihilation, which could have consequences for\nupcoming observational programs.\n", "  Recent high-resolution simulations together with theoretical studies of the\ndynamical evolution of galactic disks have shown that contrary to wide-held\nbeliefs a `live', dynamically responsive, dark halo surrounding a disk does not\nstabilize the disk against dynamical instabilities. We generalize Toomre's Q\nstability parameter for a disk-halo system and show that if a disk, which would\nbe otherwise stable, is embedded in a halo, which is too massive and cold, the\ncombined disk-halo system can become locally Jeans unstable. The good news is,\non the other hand, that this will not happen in real dark haloes, which are in\nradial hydrostatic equilibrium. Even very low-mass disks are not prone to such\ndynamical instabilities.\n", "  The functional integral has many triumphs in elucidating quantum theory. But\nincorporating charge fractionalization into that formalism remains a challenge.\n", "  I review history of the color transparency (CT) which started with discovery\nof the $J/\\psi$ meson, discovery of high energy CT phenomena and the recent\nprogress in the investigations of CT at intermediate energies.\n", "  The EGRET excess of diffuse Galactic gamma rays shows all the key features of\ndark matter annihilation (DMA) for a WIMP mass in the range 50-100 GeV,\nespecially the distribution of the excess is compatible with a standard halo\nprofile with some additional ringlike substructures at 4 and 13 kpc from the\nGalactic centre. These substructures coincide with the gravitational potential\nwell expected from the ring of dust at 4 kpc and the tidal stream of dark\nmatter from the Canis Major satellite galaxy at 13 kpc, as deduced from N-body\nsimulations fitting to the Monoceros ring of stars. Strong independent support\nfor this substructure is given by the gas flaring in our Galaxy.\n  The gamma rays from DMA are originating predominantly from the hadronization\nof mono-energetic quarks, which should produce also a small, but known fraction\nof protons and antiprotons. Bergstrom et al. an antiproton flux far above the\nobserved antiproton flux and they conclude that the DMA interpretation of the\nEGRET excess can therefore be excluded. However, they used an isotropic\npropagation model, i.e. the same diffusive propagation in the disk and the\nhalo. It is shown that an anisotropic propagation model is consistent with the\nEGRET gamma ray excess, the antiproton flux and the ratios of secondary/primary\nand unstable/stable cosmic ray particles. Such an anisotropic propagation is\nsupported by the large bulge/disk ratio of the positron annihilation line, as\nobserved by the INTEGRAL satellite. In this case no need for new sources\nspecific to the bulge are needed, so the claimed evidence for strong DMA in the\nbulge from these observations is strongly propagation model dependent.\n", "  We discuss the basic difficulties in understanding the origin of the highest\nenergy particles in the Universe - the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECR). It\nis difficult to imagine the sources they are accelerated in. Because of the\nstrong attenuation of UHECR on their propagation from the sources to us these\nsources should be at cosmologically short distance from us but are currently\nnot identified. We also give information of the most recent experimental\nresults including the ones reported at this conference and compare them to\nmodels of the UHECR origin.\n", "  All the geometric phases, adiabatic and non-adiabatic, are formulated in a\nunified manner in the second quantized path integral formulation. The exact\nhidden local symmetry inherent in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation defines the\nholonomy. All the geometric phases are shown to be topologically trivial. The\ngeometric phases are briefly compared to the chiral anomaly which is naturally\nformulated in the path integral.\n", "  Sterile neutrinos with keV masses can constitute all or part of the\ncosmological dark matter. The electroweak-singlet fermions, which are usually\nintroduced to explain the masses of active neutrinos, need not be heavier than\nthe electroweak scale; if one of them has a keV-scale mass, it can be the\ndark-matter particle, and it can also explain the observed pulsar kicks. The\nrelic sterile neutrinos could be produced by several different mechanisms. If\nthey originate primarily from the Higgs decays at temperatures of the order of\n100 GeV, the resulting dark matter is much ``colder'' than the warm dark matter\nproduced in neutrino oscillations. The signature of this form of dark matter is\nthe spectral line from the two-body decay, which can be detected by the X-ray\ntelescopes. The same X-rays can have other observable manifestations, in\nparticular, though their effects on the formation of the first stars.\n", "  The issue of the number, nature and sequence of phase transitions in the\nfully frustrated XY (FFXY) model is a highly non trivial one due to the complex\ninterplay between its continuous and discrete degrees of freedom. In this\ncontribution we attack such a problem by means of a twisted conformal field\ntheory (CFT) approach and show how it gives rise to the U (1)$\\otimes Z_{2}$\nsymmetry and to the whole spectrum of excitations of the FFXY model.\n", "  Recent theoretical developments in the studies of two-photon exchange effects\nin elastic electron-proton scattering are reviewed. Two-photon exchange\nmechanism is considered a likely source of discrepancy between polarized and\nunpolarized experimental measurements of the proton electric form factor at\nmomentum transfers of several GeV$^2$. This mechanism predicts measurable\neffects that are currently studied experimentally.\n", "  The modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity can be motivated by a number of physical\nreasons, including: the uniqueness of a gravitational Lagrangian in four and\nhigher dimensions and the leading order $\\alpha^\\prime$ corrections in\nsuperstring theory. Such an effective theory of scalar-tensor gravity has been\nmodeled in the recent past to explain both the initial cosmological singularity\nproblem and the observationally supported cosmological perturbations. Here I\npresent an overview of the recent developments in the use of modified\nGauss-Bonnet gravity to explain current observations, touching on key\ncosmological and astrophysical constraints applicable to theories of\nscalar-tensor gravity. The Gauss-Bonnet type modification of Einstein's theory\nadmits nonsingular solutions for a wide range of scalar-curvature couplings. It\nalso provides plausible explanation to some outstanding cosmological\nconundrums, including: the transition from matter dominance to dark energy and\nthe late time cosmic acceleration. The focus is placed here to constrain such\nan effective theory of gravity against the recent cosmological and\nastrophysical observations.\n", "  Measurement of the direction of the elastic nuclear recoil track and\nionization charge distribution along it, gives unique possibility for\nunambiguous detection of the dark matter WIMP particle. Within current\nradiation detection technologies only Time Projection Chambers filled with low\npressure gas are capable of such measurement. Due to the character of the\nelectronic and nuclear stopping powers of low energy nuclear recoils in the\ngas, an asymmetric ionization charge distribution along their tracks may be\nexpected. Preliminary study of this effect, called Head-Tail, has been carried\nout here using the SRIM simulation program for Carbon and Sulfur in 40 Torr\ncarbon disulfide, as relevant to the DRIFT detector. Investigations were\nfocused on ion tracks projected onto the axis of the initial direction of\nmotion in the energy range between 10 and 400 keV. Results indicate the likely\nexistence of an asymmetry influenced by two competing effects: the nature of\nthe stopping power and range straggling. The former tends to result in the Tail\nbeing greater than the Head and the latter the reverse. It has been found that\nfor projected tracks the mean position of the ionization charge flows from\n'head' to 'tail' with the magnitude depending on the ion type and its energy.\n", "  A possibility and properties of spontaneous magnetization in quark matter are\ninvestigated. Magnetic susceptibility is evaluated within Fermi liquid theory,\ntaking into account of the screening effect of gluons. Spin wave in the\npolarized quark matter, as the Nambu-Goldstone mode, is formulated by way of\nthe coherent-state path integral.\n", "  We investigate when the energy that pins a superfluid vortex to the lattice\nof nuclei in the inner crust of neutron stars can be approximated by the energy\nthat binds the vortex to a single nucleus. Indeed, although the pinning energy\nis the quantity relevant to the theory of pulsar glitches, so far full quantum\ncalculations have been possible only for the binding energy. Physically, the\npresence of nearby nuclei can be neglected if the lattice is dilute, namely\nwith nuclei sufficiently distant from each other. We find that the dilute limit\nis reached only for quite large Wigner-Seitz cells, with radii > 55 fm; these\nare found only in the outermost low-density regions of the inner crust. We\nconclude that present quantum calculations do not correspond to the pinning\nenergies in almost the entire inner crust and thus their results are not\npredictive for the theory of glitches.\n", "  We present a concise review of the physics of ultra-cold dipolar gases, based\nmainly on the theoretical developments in our own group. First, we discuss\nshortly weakly interacting ultra-cold trapped dipolar gases. Dipolar\nBose-Einstein condensates exhibit non-standard instabilities and the physics of\nboth Bose and Fermi dipolar gases depends on the trap geometry. We focus then\nthe second part of the paper on strongly correlated dipolar gases and discuss\nultra-cold dipolar gases in optical lattices. Such gases exhibit a spectacular\nrichness of quantum phases and metastable states, which may perhaps be used as\nquantum memories. We comment shortly on the possibility of superchemistry\naiming at the creation of dipolar heteronuclear molecules in lattices. Finally,\nwe turn to ultra-cold dipolar gases in artificial magnetic fields, and consider\nrotating dipolar gases, that provide in our opinion the best option towards the\nrealization of the fractional quantum Hall effect and quantum Wigner crystals.\n", "  We investigate the properties of the hadron-quark mixed phase in compact\nstars using a Brueckner-Hartree-Fock framework for hadronic matter and the MIT\nbag model for quark matter. We find that the equation of state of the mixed\nphase is similar to that given by the Maxwell construction. The composition of\nthe mixed phase, however, is very different from that of the Maxwell\nconstruction; in particular, hyperons are completely suppressed.\n", "  We summarize recent results for the Gribov-Zwanziger Lagrangian which\nincludes the effect of restricting the path integral to the first Gribov\nregion. These include the two loop MSbar and one loop MOM gap equations for the\nGribov mass.\n", "  Because of colour confinement, the physical vacuum forms an event horizon for\nquarks and gluons; this can be crossed only by quantum tunneling, i.e., through\nthe QCD counterpart of Hawking radiation by black holes. Since such radiation\ncannot transmit information to the outside, it must be thermal, of a\ntemperature determined by the strong force at the confinement surface, and it\nmust maintain colour neutrality. The resulting process provides a common\nmechanism for thermal hadron production in high energy interactions, from\n$e^+e^-$ annihilation to heavy ion collisions. The analogy with black-hole\nevent horizon suggests a dependence of the hadronization temperature on the\nbaryon density.\n", "  We discuss the interpretation of the $ep\\to ep\\rho^0$ process in terms of, on\nthe one hand, Generalized Parton Distributions and, on the other hand, an\neffective hadronic model based on Regge theory.\n", "  We analyze the impact of a porous medium (structural disorder) on the scaling\nof the partition function of a star polymer immersed in a good solvent. We show\nthat corresponding scaling exponents change if the disorder is\nlong-range-correlated and calculate the exponents in the new universality\nclass. A notable finding is that star and chain polymers react in qualitatively\ndifferent manner on the presence of disorder: the corresponding scaling\nexponents increase for chains and decrease for stars. We discuss the physical\nconsequences of this difference.\n", "  We investigate analytically a connection between the t-J model and the\nstrongly correlated Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) Hamiltonian, with the\neffect of strong electron correlations accounted by the Gutzwiller projection.\nWe show that in the immediate vicinity of half filling the projected 2D BCS\nHamiltonian with strong pairing develops an antiferromagnetically (AF) ordered\nground state. This result explicitly demonstrates that antiferromagnetism in\nthis model appears as a natural consequence of the strong Coulomb repulsion in\na low doped regime. At moderate doping the ground state of the\nGutzwiller-projected BCS Hamiltonian becomes qualitatively similar to\nAnderson's resonating valence bond state which is known to fit nicely the\nproperties of the t-J model in this regime. These two properties taken together\nindicate that the projected BCS Hamiltonian captures the essential low-energy\nphysics of the t-J model in the whole underdoped region.\n", "  We outline three new ideas in a program to obtain standard physics, including\nstandard supersymmetry, from a Planck-scale statistical theory: (1) The initial\nspin 1/2 bosonic fields are transformed to spin 0 fields together with their\nauxiliary fields. (2) Time is defined by the progression of 3-geometries, just\nas originally proposed by DeWitt. (3) The initial (D-1)-dimensional \"path\nintegral\" is converted from Euclidean to Lorentzian form by transformation of\nthe fields in the integrand.\n", "  Higher-order perturbative calculations in Quantum (Field) Theory suffer from\nthe factorial increase of the number of individual diagrams. Here I describe an\napproach which evaluates the total contribution numerically for finite\ntemperature from the cumulant expansion of the corresponding observable\nfollowed by an extrapolation to zero temperature. This method (originally\nproposed by Bogolyubov and Plechko) is applied to the calculation of\nhigher-order terms for the ground-state energy of the polaron. Using\nstate-of-the-art multidimensional integration routines 2 new coefficients are\nobtained corresponding to a 4- and 5-loop calculation.\n", "  The semi-classical approximation to black hole partition functions is not\nwell-defined, because the classical action is unbounded and the first variation\nof the uncorrected action does not vanish for all variations preserving the\nboundary conditions. Both problems can be solved by adding a Hamilton-Jacobi\ncounterterm. I show that the same problem and solution arises in quantum\nmechanics for half-binding potentials.\n", "  The pervasive role of the nuclear symmetry energy in establishing some\nnuclear static and dynamical properties, and in governing some attributes of\nneutron star properties is highlighted.\n", "  Experiments with thin ZnS(Ag) scintillators provide evidence with C.L. >\n99.99% for the existence of DArk Electric Matter Objects - daemons (presumably\nnegatively charged Planckian particles with M ~ 10^-5 g) captured from the\nGalactic disk into near-Earth, almost circular heliocentric orbits. Their flux\nat V ~ 10-15 km/s was found to be as high as f > 10^-7 cm^-2 s^-1 and vary with\nP = 0.5 y, with maxima in March and September. A daemon flux f ~ 10^-7 - 10^-6\ncm^-2 s^-1 is capable of accounting for the Troitsk anomaly in the tritium\nbeta-spectrum and suggests its more pronounced manifestation in future KATRIN\nexperiment. In view of the channeling effect on iodine recoil nuclei in the\nNaI(Tl) crystal, the DAMA/NaI experiment is also apparently detecting a flux of\ndaemons, f ~ 6x10^-7 cm^-2 s^-1, but in this case of those falling with V =\n30-50 km/s from strongly elongated, Earth-crossing heliocentric orbits oriented\nin the antapex direction, as a result of which the number of events detected in\nthe 2-6-keV interval varies with P = 1 y.\n", "  I recently proposed a method of bosonization valid for systems of an even\nnumber of fermions whose partition function is dominated at low energy by\nbosonic composites. This method respects all symmetries, in particular fermion\nnumber conservation. I extend it to treat odd systems and excitations involving\nunpaired fermions.\n", "  It is shown that superpositions of path integrals with arbitrary Hamiltonians\nand different scaling parameters v (\"variances\") obey the Chapman-Kolmogorov\nrelation for Markovian processes if and only if the corresponding smearing\ndistributions for v have a specific functional form. Ensuing \"smearing\"\ndistributions substantially simplify the coupled system of Fokker-Planck\nequations for smeared and un-smeared conditional probabilities. Simple\napplication in financial models with stochastic volatility is presented.\n", "  Recent indications for high neutron star masses (M \\sim 2 M_sun) and large\nradii (R > 12 km) could rule out soft equations of state and have provoked a\ndebate whether the occurence of quark matter in compact stars can be excluded\nas well. We show that modern quantum field theoretical approaches to quark\nmatter including color superconductivity and a vector meanfield allow a\nmicroscopic description of hybrid stars which fulfill the new, strong\nconstraints. For these objects color superconductivity turns out to be an\nessential ingredient for a successful description of the cooling phenomenology\nin accordance with recently developed tests. We discuss the energy release in\nthe neutrino untrapping transition as a new aspect of the problem that hybrid\nstars masquerade themselves as neutron stars. Quark matter searches in future\ngenerations of low-temperature/high-density nucleus-nucleus collision\nexperiments such as low-energy RHIC and CBM @ FAIR might face the same problem\nof an almost crossover behavior of the deconfinement transition. Therefore,\ndiagnostic tools shall be derived from effects of color superconductivity.\n", "  Form factors of nucleons and mesons with timelike momentum transfers are\ndiscussed. New experimental results for protons, pions, and kaons at large\nmomentum transfers are presented, and the inadequacy of existing theoretical\nideas about these is pointed out.\n", "  Results of the CMS Silicon Strip Tracker performance are presented as\nobtained in the setups where the tracker is being commissioned.\n", "  We review the salient features of $B$-meson physics, with particular emphasis\non the measurements carried out at the $B$-factories and Tevatron, theoretical\nprogress in understanding these measurements in the context of the standard\nmodel, and anticipation at the LHC. Topics discussed specifically are the\ncurrent status of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, the CP-violating\nphases, rare radiative and semileptonic decays, and some selected non-leptonic\ntwo-body decays of the $B$ mesons.\n", "  The SLIM experiment is a large array of nuclear track detectors located at\nthe Chacaltaya High Altitude Laboratory (5260 m a.s.l.). The preliminary\nresults from the analysis of ~383 m^2 exposed for 4.07 y are here reported. The\ndetector is sensitive to Intermediate Mass Magnetic Monopoles, 10^5 < M_M <\n10^12 GeV, and to SQM nuggets and Q-balls, which are possible Dark Matter\ncandidates.\n", "  In this work we discuss the dynamics of a three dimensional chain which is\ndescribed by generalized nonlinear sigma model The formula of the probability\ndistribution of two topologically entangled chain is provided. The interesting\ncase of a chain which can form only discrete angles with respect to the\n$z-$axis is also presented.\n", "  We review some recent results on the connection between CP violation at low\nenergies and Leptogenesis in the framework of specific flavour structures for\nthe fundamental leptonic mass matrices with zero textures.\n", "  A mixture of spin-1/2 fermionic atoms and molecules of paired fermionic atoms\nis studied in an optical lattice. The molecules are formed by an attractive\nnearest-neighbor interaction. A functional integral is constructed for this\nmany-body system and analyzed in terms of a mean-field approximation and\nGaussian fluctuations. This provides a phase diagram with the two merging Mott\ninsulators and an intermediate superfluid. The Gaussian fluctuations give rise\nto an induced repulsive dimer-dimer interaction mediated by the unpaired\nfermions. The effect of an unbalanced distribution of spin-up and spin-down\nfermions is also discussed.\n", "  With stochastic transport simulations we study in detail central and\nperipheral collisions at Fermi energies and suggest new observables, sensitive\nto the symmetry energy below normal density. As such we identify on one hand\nthe isospin imbalance ratio, i.e. the relative amount of isospin equilibration\nin binary, peripheral reactions of nuclei with different isospin, as a function\nof the energy loss, which is sensitive to isospin diffusion; on the other hand\nthe isospin asymmetry of an intermediate mass fragment (IMF) in symmetric\ncollisions in ternary reactions, or more particularly, the ratio of the IMF to\nthe residue asymmetry, which is sensitive to isospin migration.\n", "  An overview is presented of a recently proposed \"radically conservative\"\nsolution to the problem of dark energy in cosmology. The proposal yields a\nmodel universe which appears to be quantitatively viable, in terms of its fit\nto supernovae luminosity distances, the angular scale of the sound horizon in\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectrum, and the baryon\nacoustic oscillation scale. It may simultaneously resolve key anomalies\nrelating to primordial lithium abundances, CMB ellipticity, the expansion age\nof the universe and the Hubble bubble feature. The model uses only general\nrelativity, and matter obeying the strong energy condition, but revisits\noperational issues in interpreting average measurements in our presently\ninhomogeneous universe, from first principles. The present overview examines\nboth the foundational issues concerning the definition of gravitational energy\nin a dynamically expanding space, the quantitative predictions of the new model\nand its best-fit cosmological parameters, and the prospects for an era of new\nobservational tests in cosmology.\n", "  Following the unexpected theoretical discovery of a mass dimension one\nfermionic quantum field of spin one half, we now present first results on two\n_local_ versions. The Dirac and Majorana fields of the standard model of\nparticle physics are supplemented by their natural counterparts in the dark\nmatter sector. The possibility that a mass dimension transmuting symmetry may\nunderlie a new standard model of particle physics is briefly suggested.\n", "  We discuss vacuum energy in string and M-theory with a focus on heterotic\nM-theory. In the latter theory a mechanism is described for maintaining zero\nvacuum energy after supersymmetry breaking. Higher-order corrections can be\nexpected to give a sufficiently small amount of vacuum energy to possibly\naccount for dark energy.\n", "  We present a rigorous proof of the appearance of quantized vortices in dilute\ntrapped Bose gases with repulsive two-body interactions subject to rotation,\nwhich was obtained recently in joint work with Elliott Lieb. Starting from the\nmany-body Schroedinger equation, we show that the ground state of such gases\nis, in a suitable limit, well described by the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation. In the case of axially symmetric traps, our results show that the\nappearance of quantized vortices causes spontaneous symmetry breaking in the\nground state.\n", "  Ricci flow deformation of cosmological initial data sets in general\nrelativity is a technique for generating families of initial data sets which\npotentially would allow to interpolate between distinct spacetimes. This idea\nhas been around since the appearance of the Ricci flow on the scene, but it has\nbeen difficult to turn it into a sound mathematical procedure. In this\nexpository talk we illustrate, how Perelman's recent results in Ricci flow\ntheory can considerably improve on such a situation. From a physical point of\nview this analysis can be related to the issue of finding a constant-curvature\ntemplate spacetime for the inhomogeneous Universe, relevant to the\ninterpretation of observational data and, hence, bears relevance to the dark\nenergy and dark matter debates. These techniques provide control on curvature\nfluctuations (intrinsic backreaction terms) in their relation to the averaged\nmatter distribution.\n", "  We study earthquake interval time statistics, paying special attention to\ninter-occurrence times in the two-dimensional (2D) stick-slip (block-slider)\nmodel. Inter-occurrence times are the time interval between successive\nearthquakes on all faults in a region. We select stiffness and friction\nparameters as tunable parameters because these physical quantities are\nconsidered as essential factors in describing fault dynamics. It is found that\ninter-occurrence time statistics depend on the parameters. Varying stiffness\nand friction parameters systematically, we optimize these parameters so as to\nreproduce the inter-occurrence time statistics in natural seismicity. For an\noptimal case, earthquakes produced by the model obey the Gutenberg-Richter law,\nwhich states that the magnitude-frequency distribution exhibits the power law\nwith an exponent approximately unity.\n", "  A sufficient condition for non-Markovian master equation which ensures the\ncomplete positivity of the resulting time evolution is presented.\n", "  I offer some historical comments about the origins of Feynman's path integral\napproach, as an alternative approach to standard quantum mechanics. Looking at\nthe interaction between Einstein and Feynman, which was mediated by Feynman's\nthesis supervisor John Wheeler, it is argued that, contrary to what one might\nexpect, the significance of the interaction between Einstein and Feynman\npertained to a critique of classical field theory, rather than to a direct\ncritique of quantum mechanics itself. Nevertheless, the critical perspective on\nclassical field theory became a motivation and point of departure for Feynman's\nspace-time approach to non-relativistic quantum mechanics.\n", "  We discus recent developments in theory of high energy two-body break-up\nreactions of few-nucleon systems. The characteristics of these reactions are\nsuch that the hard two-body quasielastic subprocess can be clearly separated\nfrom the accompanying soft subprocesses. We discuss in details the hard\nrescattering model (HRM) in which hard photodisintegration develops in two\nstages. At first, photon knocks-out an energetic quark which rescatters\nsubsequently with a quark of the other nucleon. The latter provides a mechanism\nof sharing the initial high momentum of the photon by the outgoing two\nnucleons. Within HRM we discuss hard break-up reactions involving $^2D$ and\n$^3He$ targets. Another development of HRM is the prediction of new helicity\nselection mechanism for hard two-body reactions, which was apparently confirmed\nin the recent JLab experiment.\n", "  Based on quantum field theory at finite temperature we carried out new\nresults for two-particle Bose-Einstein correlation (BEC) function ${C_2}(Q)$ in\ncase of light hadrons. The important parameters of BEC function related to the\nsize of the emitting source, mean multiplicity, stochastic forces range with\nthe particle energy and mass dependence, and the temperature of the source are\nobtained for the first time. Not only the correlation between identical hadrons\nare explored but even the off-correlation between non-identical particles are\nproposed. The correlations of two bosons in 4-momentum space presented in this\npaper offer useful and instructive complimentary viewpoints to theoretical and\nexperimental works in multiparticle femtoscopy and interferometry measurements\nat hadron colliders. This paper is the first one to the next opening series of\nworks concerning the searching of BEC with experimental data where the\nparameters above mentioned will be retrieved.\n", "  Nonperturbative picture of strong interacting quark-gluon plasma is given\nbased on the systematic Field Correlator Method. Equation of state, phase\ntransition in density-temperature plane is derived and compared to lattice data\nas well as subsequent thermodynamical quantities of QGP.\n", "  The angular correlation of the electrons in the neutrinoless double beta\ndecay ($0\\nu2\\beta$) is calculated taking into account the nucleon recoil, the\n$S$ and $P$-waves for the electrons and the electron mass using a general\nLorentz invariant effective Lagrangian. We show that the angular coefficient is\nessentially independent of the nuclear matrix element models. We work out the\nangular coefficient in several scenarios for new physics, in particular, in the\nleft-right symmetric models.\n", "  We discuss rare meson decays $K^ + \\to \\pi ^ - \\ell ^ + \\ell '^ +$ and $D^ +\n\\to K^ - \\ell ^ + \\ell '^ +$ ($\\ell ,\\ell ' = e,\\mu $) in a supersymmetric\nextension of the standard model with explicit breaking of R-parity by bilinear\nYukawa couplings in the superpotential. Estimates of the branching ratios for\nthese decays are given. We also compare our numerical results with analogous\nones previously obtained for two other mechanisms of lepton number violation:\nexchange by massive Majorana neutrinos and trilinear R-parity violation.\n", "  The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), whose final version AMS-02 is to be\ninstalled on the International Space Station (ISS) for at least 3 years, is a\ndetector designed to measure charged cosmic ray spectra with energies up to the\nTeV region and with high energy photon detection capability up to a few hundred\nGeV. It is equipped with several subsystems, one of which is a proximity\nfocusing RICH detector with a dual radiator (aerogel+NaF) that provides\nreliable measurements for particle velocity and charge. The assembly and\ntesting of the AMS RICH is currently being finished and the full AMS detector\nis expected to be ready by the end of 2008. The RICH detector of AMS-02 is\npresented. Physics prospects are briefly discussed.\n", "  An overview is given about the capabilities provided by the JLab 12 GeV\nUpgrade to measure deeply virtual exclusive processes with high statistics and\ncovering a large kinematics range in the parameters that are needed to allow\nreconstruction of a spatial image of the nucleon's quark structure. The\nmeasurements planned with CLAS12 will cross section asymmetries with polarized\nbeams and with longitudinally and transversely polarized proton targets in the\nconstrained kinematics $x = \\pm \\xi$. In addition, unpolarized DVCS cross\nsections, and doubly polarized beam target asymmetries will be measured as\nwell. In this talk only the beam and target asymmetries will be discussed.\n", "  We analyze the spectrum of the generalized Schrodinger operator in\n$L^2(R^\\nu) \\nu \\geq 2$, with a general local, rotationally invariant singular\ninteraction supported by an infinite family of concentric, equidistantly spaced\nspheres. It is shown that the essential spectrum consists of interlaced\nsegments of the dense point and absolutely continuous character, and that the\nrelation of their lengths at high energies depends on the choice of the\ninteraction parameters; generically the p.p. component is asymptotically\ndominant. We also show that for $\\nu=2$ there is an infinite family of\neigenvalues below the lowest band.\n", "  In-medium effects on transverse-mass distributions of quarks and gluons are\nconsidered assuming a possible local equilibrium for colorless quark objects\n(mesons and baryons) created in central A-A collisions. It is shown that the\naverage transverse momentum squared for these partons grows and then saturates\nwhen the initial energy increases. Within the quark-gluon string model it leads\nto the colliding energy dependence of hadron transverse mass spectra which is\nsimilar to that observed in heavy ion collisions. Comparison with other\nscenarios is given.\n", "  We present a review of recent work on the mathematical aspects of the BCS gap\nequation, covering our results of [arXiv:0801.4159] as well our recent joint\nwork with Hamza and Solovej [arXiv:math-ph/0703086] and with Frank and Naboko\n[arXiv:0704.3564], respectively. In addition, we mention some related new\nresults.\n", "  We review recent progress at the Centre for Cold Matter in developing atom\nchips. An important advantage of miniaturizing atom traps on a chip is the\npossibility of obtaining very tight trapping structures with the capability of\nmanipulating atoms on the micron length scale. We recall some of the pros and\ncons of bringing atoms close to the chip surface, as is required in order to\nmake small static structures, and we discuss the relative merits of metallic,\ndielectric and superconducting chip surfaces. We point out that the addition of\nintegrated optical devices on the chip can enhance its capability through\nsingle atom detection and controlled photon production. Finally, we review the\nstatus of integrated microcavities that have recently been demonstrated at our\nCentre and discuss their prospects for future development.\n", "  The Auger experiment was designed to study the high-energy cosmic rays by\nmeasuring the properties of the showers produced in the atmosphere. The\nSouthern Auger Observatory has taken data since January 2004. Results on mass\ncomposition, energy spectrum and anisotropy of the arrival directions are\npresented. The most important result is the recent observation of correlations\nwith nearby extragalactic objects.\n", "  In contrast with common non-relativistic lore, the usual Sachs form factors\nare not the Fourier transforms of charge or magnetization densities. Instead,\nthe two-dimensional Fourier transform of the electromagnetic $F_1$ form factor\nis the charge charge density of partons in the transverse plane. An analysis of\nthe available data for neutron form factors leads to the result that the\nneutron charge density is negative at the center, and that the square of the\ntransverse charge radius is positive. This contrasts with many expectations.\nAdditionally, the use of measured proton form factors leads to the result that\nthe proton's central $u$ quark charge density is larger than that of the $d$\nquark by about 80%. The proton (neutron) charge density has a long range\npositively (negatively) charged component indicative of a pion cloud.\n", "  The basic idea and some physical implications of nonlinear supersymmetric\ngeneral relativity (NLSUSY GR) are discussed, which give new insights into the\norigin of mass and the mysterious relations between the cosmology and the low\nenergy particle physics, e.g. the spontaneous SUSY breaking scale, the\ncosmological constant, the (dark) energy density of the universe and the\nneutrino mass.\n", "  I discuss the current status of efforts to constrain the\nstrangeness-conserving weak hadronic interaction, which can be isolated in\nnuclear systems because of the associated parity violation.\n", "  Beta-beams is a new concept for the production of intense and pure neutrino\nbeams. It is at the basis of a proposed neutrino facility, whose main goal is\nto explore the possible existence of CP violation in the lepton sector. Here we\nbriefly review the original scenario and the low energy beta-beam. This option\nwould offer a unique opportunity to perform neutrino interaction studies of\ninterest for particle physics, astrophysics and nuclear physics. Other proposed\nscenarios for the search of CP violation are mentioned.\n", "  We investigate a class of one-dimensional, exactly solvable anisotropic XY\nspin-1/2 models in an alternating transverse magnetic field from an\nentanglement perspective. We find that a physically motivated Lie-algebraic\ngeneralized entanglement measure faithfully portraits the static phase diagram\n-- including second- and fourth-order quantum phase transitions belonging to\ndistinct universality classes. In the simplest time-dependent scenario of a\nslow quench across a quantum critical point, we identify parameter regimes\nwhere entanglement exhibits universal dynamical scaling relative to the static\nlimit.\n", "  The correlation energy in density functional theory can be expressed exactly\nin terms of the change in the probability of finding two electrons at a given\ndistance $r_{12}$ (intracule density) when the electron-electron interaction is\nmultiplied by a real parameter $\\lambda$ varying between 0 (Kohn-Sham system)\nand 1 (physical system). In this process, usually called adiabatic connection,\nthe one-electron density is (ideally) kept fixed by a suitable local one-body\npotential. While an accurate intracule density of the physical system can only\nbe obtained from expensive wavefunction-based calculations, being able to\nconstruct good models starting from Kohn-Sham ingredients would highly improve\nthe accuracy of density functional calculations. To this purpose, we\ninvestigate the intracule density in the $\\lambda\\to\\infty$ limit of the\nadiabatic connection. This strong-interaction limit of density functional\ntheory turns out to be, like the opposite non-interacting Kohn-Sham limit,\nmathematically simple and can be entirely constructed from the knowledge of the\none-electron density. We develop here the theoretical framework and, using\naccurate correlated one-electron densities, we calculate the intracule\ndensities in the strong interaction limit for few atoms. Comparison of our\nresults with the corresponding Kohn-Sham and physical quantities provides\nuseful hints for building approximate intracule densities along the adiabatic\nconnection of density functional theory.\n", "  I review the main features of the color charge degree of freedom in particle\nphysics, sketch the paradox in the early quark model that led to color, give a\npersonal perspective on the discovery of color and describe the introduction of\nthe gauge theory of color.\n", "  A deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (DRHB) model is developed aiming\nat a proper description of exotic nuclei, particularly deformed ones with large\nspatial extension. In order to give an adequate description of both the\ncontribution of the continuum and the large spatial distribution in exotic\nnuclei, the DRHB equations are solved in a Woods-Saxon basis in which the\nradial wave functions have proper asymptotic behaviors at large distance from\nthe nuclear center which is crucial for the formation of halo. The formalism\nand the numerical procedure of the DRHB model in a Woods-Saxon basis are\nbriefly presented.\n", "  We studied the statics and dynamics of elastic manifolds in disordered media\nwith long-range correlated disorder using functional renormalization group\n(FRG). We identified different universality classes and computed the critical\nexponents and universal amplitudes describing geometric and velocity-force\ncharacteristics. In contrast to uncorrelated disorder, the statistical tilt\nsymmetry is broken resulting in a nontrivial response to a transverse tilting\nforce. For instance, the vortex lattice in disordered superconductors shows a\nnew glass phase whose properties interpolate between those of the Bragg and\nBose glasses formed by pointlike and columnar disorder, respectively. Whereas\nthere is no response in the Bose glass phase (transverse Meissner effect), the\nstandard linear response expected in the Bragg-glass gets modified to a power\nlaw response in the presence of disorder correlations. We also studied the long\ndistance properties of the O(N) spin system with random fields and random\nanisotropies correlated as 1/x^{d-sigma}. Using FRG we obtained the phase\ndiagram in (d,sigma,N)-parameter space and computed the corresponding critical\nexponents. We found that below the lower critical dimension 4+sigma, there can\nexist two different types of quasi-long-range-order with zero order-parameter\nbut infinite correlation length.\n", "  In this short note, we describe some recent results on the pointwise\nexistence of the Lyapunov exponent for certain quasi-periodic cocyles.\n", "  An extended SU(3) shell model that for the first time explicitly includes\nunique-parity levels is introduced. Shell-model calculations for the isotopes\nof $^{64}$Ge and $^{68}$Se are performed where valence nucleons beyond the\nN=28=Z core occupy levels of the normal parity upper-$fp$ shell\n($f_{5/2},p_{3/2},p_{1/2}$) and the unique parity $g_{9/2}$ intruder\nconfiguration. The levels of the upper-$fp$ shell are handled within the\nframework of an m-scheme basis as well as its pseudo-SU(3) counterpart, and\nrespectively, the $g_{9/2}$ as a single level and as a member for the complete\n$gds$ shell. It is demonstrated that the extended SU(3) approach allows one to\nbetter probe the effects of deformation and to account for many key properties\nof the system by using a highly truncated model space.\n", "  Recent microscopic calculation based on the density functional theory\npredicts long-lived superheavy elements in a variety of shapes, including\nspherical, axial and triaxial configurations. Only when N=184 is approached one\nexpects superheavy nuclei that are spherical in their ground states. Magic\nislands of extra-stability have been predicted to be around Z=114, 124 or, 126\nwith N=184, and Z=120, with N=172. However, the question of whether the\nfission-survived superheavy nuclei with high Z and N would live long enough for\ndetection or, undergo alpha-decay in a very short time remains open. In this\ntalk I shall present results of our calculations of alpha-decay half lives of\nheavy and superheavy nuclei. Calculations, carried out in a WKB framework using\ndensity-dependent M3Y interaction, have been found to reproduce the\nexperimental data quite well. Fission survived Sg nuclei with Z=106, N=162 is\npredicted to have the highest alpha-decay half life (~3.2 hrs) in the\nZ=106-108, N=160-164 region called, small island/peninsula. Neutron-rich (N\n>170) superheavy nuclei with Z >118 are found to have half-lives of the order\nof microseconds or, less.\n", "  The project of the international Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research\n(FAIR), co-located to the GSI facility in Darmstadt, has been officially\nstarted on November 7, 2007. The current plans of the facility and the planned\nresearch program will be described. An investment of about 1 billion euro will\npermit new physics programs in the areas of low and medium energy antiproton\nresearch, heavy ion physics complementary to LHC, as well as in nuclear\nstructure and astrophysics. The facility will comprise about a dozen\naccelerators and storage rings, which will enable simultaneous operations of up\nto four different beams.\n", "  Quantum plasmas is a rapidly expanding field of research, with applications\nranging from nanoelectronics, nanoscale devices and ultracold plasmas, to\ninertial confinement fusion and astrophysics. Here we give a short systematic\noverview of quantum plasmas. In particular, we analyze the collective effects\ndue to spin using fluid models. The introduction of an intrinsic magnetization\ndue to the plasma electron (or positron) spin properties in the\nmagnetohydrodynamic limit is discussed. Finally, a discussion of the theory and\nexamples of applications is given.\n", "  Plasmas are usually described using classical equations. While this is often\na good approximation, where are situations when a quantum description is\nmotivated. In this paper we will include several quantum effects, ranging from\nparticle dispersion, which give raise to the so called Bohm potential, to spin\neffects, and to quantum electrodynamical effects. The later effects appears\nwhen the field strength approaches the Schwinger critical field, which may\noccur in for example astrophysical systems. Examples of how to model such\nquantum effects will be presented, and the phenomena resulting from these\nmodels will be discussed.\n", "  Knowledge about parity-violating effects both from theory and experiment is\nreviewed. Further information that could be obtained from measurements of\nnuclear anapole moments is discussed.\n", "  The new EAS Cherenkov array TUNKA-133, with about 1 km**2 sensitive area, is\nbeing installed in the Tunka Valley. The investigated energy range is\n10**15-10**18 eV. It will consist of 133 optical detectors based on EMI9350\nPMTs. Optical detectors are grouped into 19 clusters with 7 detectors each. The\ndetectors are connected to the cluster box with RG-58 cables. Every PMT signal\nis digitized in the cluster box with 200 MHz FADC. The cluster boxes are\nconnected to the data acquisition center with a 1 Gb/s optical link. A detailed\ndescription of the data acquisition system (DAQ) is presented.\n", "  We present clear evidence of strong effects of Gribov copies in Landau gauge\ngluon and ghost propagators computed on the lattice at small momenta by\nemploying a new approach to Landau gauge fixing and a more effective numerical\nalgorithm. It is further shown that the new approach substantially decreases\nnotorious finite-volume effects.\n", "  An elementary perturbative method of handling the Higgs-Kibble models and\nderiving their relevant properties, is described. It is based on Wightman field\ntheory and avoids some of the mathematical weaknesses of the standard\ntreatments.\n", "  A hypothetical picture of massive excitations of 4-dimensional Yang-Mills\nquantum field theory as closed knotted fat strings is described.\n", "  Strategies that utilise the interference effects within $B^{\\pm} \\to\nDK^{\\pm}$ decays hold great potential for improving our sensitivity to the CKM\nangle $\\gamma$. However, in order to exploit fully this potential, detailed\nknowledge of the D meson decay structure is required. This essential\ninformation can be obtained from the quantum correlated $\\psi(3770)$ datasets\nat CLEO-c. Results of such analyses involving the decay mode $D \\to\nK\\pi\\pi\\pi$, and their importance in the context of LHCb, will be presented.\n", "  In these lectures I start by briefly reviewing the status of the electroweak\ntheory, in the Standard Model and beyond. I then discuss the motivation and the\npossible avenues for new physics, on the brink of the LHC start.\n", "  Recursion relations are succinctly obtained for $(++... +)$ and $(-++... +)$\namplitudes in the context of the space-cone gauge in QCD. We rely on the\nhelicity symmetry of the problems to dictate our choices of reference twistors\nand the momentum shifts to complexify the amplitudes. Of great importance is\nthe power of gauge Lorentz invariance, which is enough to determine the soft\nfactors in the latter cases.\n", "  The Belle experiment collected in 2005-6 a total of 23.6 fb$^{-1}$ of data at\nthe $\\Upsilon(10860)$ resonance, also known as $\\Upsilon$(5S). These constitute\nnearly all of the world's sample of $e^+e^- \\to \\Upsilon$(10860) events, which\nprovide clean $B_s$ pairs. We present here several $B_s$ and $\\Upsilon$(10860)\nproperties recently extracted from these data.\n", "  Distinguished selfadjoint extensions of operators which are not semibounded\ncan be deduced from the positivity of the Schur Complement (as a quadratic\nform). In practical applications this amounts to proving a Hardy-like\ninequality. Particular cases are Dirac-Coulomb operators where distinguished\nselfadjoint extensions are obtained for the optimal range of coupling\nconstants.\n", "  This paper gives an overview of recent results concerning the long time\ndynamics of repeated interaction quantum systems in a deterministic and random\nframework. We describe the non equilibrium steady states (NESS) such systems\ndisplay and we present, as a macroscopic consequence, a second law of\nthermodynamics these NESS give rise to. We also explain in some details the\nanalysis of products of certain random matrices underlying this dynamical\nproblem.\n", "  Recently, Grosse and Lechner introduced a novel deformation procedure for\nnon-interacting quantum field theories, giving rise to interesting examples of\nwedge-localized quantum fields with a non-trivial scattering matrix. In the\npresent article we outline an extension of this procedure to the general\nframework of quantum field theory by introducing the concept of warped\nconvolutions: given a theory, this construction provides wedge-localized\noperators which commute at spacelike distances, transform covariantly under the\nunderlying representation of the Poincare group and admit a scattering theory.\nThe corresponding scattering matrix is nontrivial but breaks the Lorentz\nsymmetry, in spite of the covariance and wedge-locality properties of the\ndeformed operators.\n", "  We present two recent works on the thermodynamic limit of quantum Coulomb\nsystems, in which we provided a general method allowing to show the existence\nof the limit for many different models.\n", "  Some properties of intrinsic transverse momentum dependent nucleon\ndistribution functions are considered in the simple quark-diquark model. The\ntransverse target polarization dependent asymmetries for SIDIS are calculated\nand compared with recent results of COMPASS. The model describes well the\nmeasured asymmetries. Generalization of quark-diquark model for Sivers function\nis discussed.\n", "  We explain the origin of the controversy about the existence of a transverse\nangular momentum sum rule, and show that it stems from utilizing an incorrect\nresult in the literature, concerning the expression for the expectation values\nof the angular momentum operators. We demonstrate a new, short and direct way\nof obtaining correct expressions for these expectation values, from which a\nperfectly good transverse angular momentum sum rule can be deduced. We also\nintroduce a new classification of sum rules into primary and secondary types.\nIn the former all terms occurring in the sum rule can be measured\nexperimentally; in the latter some terms cannot be measured experimentally.\n", "  The issue is the expediency of the QCD notions use in the low energy region\ndown to the confinement scale, and, in particular, the efficacy of the QCD\ninvariant coupling \\bar{\\alpha}_s(Q^2) with a minimal analytic modification in\nthis domain. To this goal, we overview a quite recent progress in application\nof the ghost-free Analytic Perturbative Theory approach (with no adjustable\nparameters) for QCD in the region below 1 GeV. Among them the Bethe--Salpeter\nanalysis of the meson spectra and spin-dependent (polarization) Bjorken sum\nrule. The impression is that there is a chance for the theoretically consistent\nand numerically correlated description of hadronic events from Z_0 till a few\nhundred MeV scale by combination of analytic pQCD and some explicit\nnon-perturbative contribution in the spirit of duality. This is an invitation\nto the practitioner community for a more courageous use of ghost-free QCD\ncoupling models for data analysis in the low energy region.\n", "  We report preliminary results of lattice super-Yang-Mills computations using\ndomain wall fermions, performed at an actual rate of 1000 Gflop/s, over the\ncourse of six months, using two BlueGene/L racks at Rensselaer's CCNI\nsupercomputing center. This has allowed us to compute the gluino condensate and\nstring tension over a wide range of lattice parameters, setting the stage for\ncontinuum, chiral extrapolations.\n", "  We summarize the intuitive connection between deformations of parton\ndistributions in impact parameter space and single-spin asymmetries. Lattice\nresults for the $x^2$-moment of the twist-3 polarized parton distribution\n$g_2(x)$ are used to estimate the average transverse force acting on the active\nquark in SIDIS in the instant after being struck by the virtual photon.\n", "  Holographic QCD provides a unique framework in which to compute QCD\nobservables. In this talk we summarize recent numerical work on computing the\npion electromagnetic form factor using an AdS/QCD action that includes both\nspontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking. We consider both hard- and\nsoft-wall model results and develop an intermediate background that supports\nthe best features of both. We also begin to see possible evidence in the fit\nfor the presence of 1/N_c corrections.\n", "  A formalism to evaluate the Sivers function, developed for calculations in\nconstituent quark models, is applied to the Isgur-Karl model. A non-vanishing\nSivers asymmetry, with opposite signs for the u and d flavor, is found; the\nBurkardt sum rule is fulfilled up to 2 %. Nuclear effects in the extraction of\nneutron single spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off\n3He are also evaluated. In the kinematics of JLab, it is found that the nuclear\neffects described by an Impulse Approximation approach are under control.\n", "  We present a general representation for the nucleon distribution amplitudes\nand for the nucleon to pion transition distribution amplitudes in terms of\nlight-cone wave functions. We apply our formalism to a light-cone constituent\nquark model giving some numerical results for both the classes of observables.\n", "  We report on a study of neutron-rich nuclei around doubly magic 132Sn in\nterms of the shell model employing a realistic effective interaction derived\nfrom the CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential. The short-range repulsion of the\nbare potential is renormalized by constructing a low-momentum potential,\nV-low-k, that is used directly as input for the calculation of the effective\ninteraction. We present results for the four nuclei beyond the N=82 shell\nclosure 134Sn, 134Sb, 136Sb, and 136Te. Comparison shows that our results are\nin very good agreement with the experimental data presently available for these\nexotic nuclei. We also present our predictions of the hitherto unknown spectrum\nof 136Sn.\n", "  We review some known facts in the transport theory of mesoscopic systems,\nincluding counting statistics, and discuss its relation with the mathematical\ntreatment of open systems.\n", "  In the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive\nquantum dynamical semigroups, we solve in the asymptotic long-time regime the\nmaster equation for two independent harmonic oscillators interacting with an\nenvironment. We give a description of the continuous-variable asymptotic\nentanglement in terms of the covariance matrix of the considered subsystem for\nan arbitrary Gaussian input state. Using Peres--Simon necessary and sufficient\ncondition for separability of two-mode Gaussian states, we show that for\ncertain classes of environments the initial state evolves asymptotically to an\nentangled equilibrium bipartite state, while for other values of the\ncoefficients describing the environment, the asymptotic state is separable. We\ncalculate also the logarithmic negativity characterizing the degree of\nentanglement of the asymptotic state.\n", "  We summarize recent results regarding the equilibrium and non-equilibrium\nbehavior of cold dilute atomic gases in the limit in which the two body\nscattering length a goes to infinity. In this limit the system is described by\na Galilean invariant (non-relativistic) conformal field theory. We discuss the\nlow energy effective lagrangian appropriate to the limit a->infinity, and\ncompute low energy coefficients using an epsilon-expansion. We also show how to\ncombine the effective lagrangian with kinetic theory in order to compute the\nshear viscosity, and compare the kinetic theory predictions to experimental\nresults extracted from the damping of collective modes in trapped Fermi gases.\n", "  Quarkyonic matter is a new phase of QCD at finite temperature and density\nwhich is distinct from the confined and de-confined phases. Its existence is\nunambiguously argued in the large number of colors limit in QCD. Hints of its\nexistence for 3 color QCD are shown in lattice Monte-Carlo data and heavy ion\nexperiments.\n", "  Depending on the density reached in the cores of neutron stars, such objects\nmay contain stable phases of novel matter found nowhere else in the Universe.\nThis article gives a brief overview of these phases of matter and discusses\nastrophysical constraints on the high-density equation of state associated with\nultra-dense nuclear matter.\n", "  Searches for extra spatial dimensions remain among the most popular new\ndirections in our quest for physics beyond the Standard Model. High-energy\ncollider experiments of the current decade should be able to find an ultimate\nanswer to the question of their existence in a variety of models. We review\nthese models and recent results from the Tevatron on searches for large,\ninverse-TeV-size, and Randall-Sundrum extra spatial dimensions. The most\ndramatic consequence of low-scale (~1 TeV) quantum gravity is copious\nproduction of mini-black holes at the LHC. We discuss selected topics in the\nmini-black-hole phenomenology.\n", "  We present the current status of the search for new physics effects in the\nmixing quantities $\\Delta M_s$, $\\Delta \\Gamma_s$ and $\\phi_s$ of the neutral\n$B_s$-system.\n", "  In this talk we discuss the microscopic limit of QCD at nonzero chemical\npotential. In this domain, where the QCD partition function is under complete\nanalytical control, we uncover an entirely new link between the spectral\ndensity of the Dirac operator and the chiral condensate: violent complex\noscillations on the microscopic scale give rise to the discontinuity of the\nchiral condensate at zero quark mass. We first establish this relation exactly\nwithin a random matrix framework and then analyze the importance of the\nindividual modes by Fourier analysis.\n", "  We investigate the gluonic pole matrix element contributing to the first\n$p_T$ moment of the distribution and fragmentation functions in a spectator\nmodel. By performing a spectral analysis, we find that for a large class of\nspectator models, the contribution of gluonic pole matrix elements is non-zero\nfor the distribution correlators, whereas in fragmentation correlators they\nvanish. This outcome is important in the study of universality for\nfragmentation functions.\n", "  We discuss the relationship between the large order behavior of the\nperturbative series for the average plaquette in pure gauge theory and\nsingularities in the complex coupling plane. We discuss simple extrapolations\nof the large order for this series. We point out that when these extrapolated\nseries are subtracted from the Monte Carlo data, one obtains (naive) estimates\nof the gluon condensate that are significantly larger than values commonly used\nin the continuum for phenomelogical purpose. We present numerical results\nconcerning the zeros of the partition function in the complex coupling plane\n(Fisher's zeros). We report recent attempts to solve this problem using the\ndensity of states. We show that weak and strong coupling expansions for the\ndensity of states agree surprisingly well for values of the action relevant for\nthe crossover regime.\n", "  To remove the linear infrared divergences in quenched approximation we\ninclude the massive fermion loop to the photon spectral function.Spectral\nfunction of fermion has no one particle singularity if we fix the anomalous\ndimension to be unity.In the case of $N$ flavour,$N$ dependence of order\nparameter is mild which may be due to screening effects.\n", "  We offer the parameter, interpreted as the \"chemical potential\", which is\nsensitive to the first order phase transition: it must decrease with number of\nevaporating (produced) particles (hadrons) if the (interacting hadron or/and\nQCD plasma) medium is boiling and it increase if no phase transition occur. The\nmain part of the paper is devoted to the question: how one can measure the\n\"chemical potential\" in the hadron inelastic processes. Our definition of this\nparameter is quite general but assumes that the hadron multiplicity is\nsufficiently large. The simple transparent phenomenological lattice gas model\nis considered for sake of clarity only.\n", "  Quantized fields in accelerated frames (Rindler spaces) with emphasis on\ngauge fields are investigated. Important properties of the dynamics in Rindler\nspaces are shown to follow from the scale invariance of the corresponding\nHamiltonians. Origin and consequences of this extraordinary property of\nHamiltonians in Rindler spaces are elucidated. Characteristics of the Unruh\nradiation, the appearance of a photon condensate and the interaction energy of\nvector and scalar static charges are discussed and implications for Yang-Mills\ntheories and QCD in Rindler spaces are indicated.\n", "  Ways to access transversity through asymmetry measurements are reviewed. The\nrecent first extraction and possible near future extractions are discussed.\n", "  One of the first physics results to come out of ATLAS will be an analysis of\nJ/psi and Upsilon production at 14 TeV. I give an overview of the motivation\nfor looking at the theoretical model underlying quarkonium production, ATLAS\nexpected performance and rates for quarkonium reconstruction and ability to\nseparate out various proposed production models with a view to improving our\nunderstanding of QCD.\n", "  We investigate the behaviour of stochastic differential equations, especially\nBurgers' eq., by means of Monte-Carlo-techniques.\n", "  We report on experiments exploring the physics of dipolar quantum gases using\na Chromium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). By means of a Feshbach resonance, it\nis possible to reduce the effects of short range interactions and reach a\nregime where the physics is governed by the long-range, anisotropic\ndipole-dipole interaction between the large ($6 \\mu_{\\rm B}$) magnetic moments\nof Chromium atoms. Several dramatic effects of the dipolar interaction are\nobserved: the usual inversion of ellipticity of the condensate during time-of\nflight is inhibited, the stability of the dipolar gas depends strongly on the\ntrap geometry, and the explosion following the collapse of an unstable dipolar\ncondensate displays d-wave like features.\n", "  The 'pretzelosity' distribution is discussed. Theoretical properties, model\nresults, and perspectives to access experimental information on this leading\ntwist, transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function are reviewed.\nIts relation to helicity and transversity distributions is highlighted.\n", "  After briefly reviewing the problems associated with non-Abelian monopoles,\nwe turn our attention to the development in our understanding of non-Abelian\n{\\it vortices} in the last several years. In the U(N) model with $N_{f}=N$\nflavors in which they were first found, the fluctuations of the orientational\nmodes along the vortex length and in time become strongly coupled at long\ndistances. They effectively reduce to Abelian ANO vortices. We discuss then a\nvery recent work on non-Abelian vortices with $CP^{n-1}\\times CP^{r-1}$\norientational moduli, which, unlike the ones so far extensively studied, do not\ndynamically Abelianize completely. The surviving vortex orientational moduli,\nfluctuating along the vortex length and in time, gets absorbed by the monopoles\nat the ends, turning into the dual gauge degrees of freedom for the latter.\n", "  In this contribution two recent analyses for the extraction of the charm\nquark mass are discussed. Although they rely on completely different\nexperimental and theoretical input the two methods provide the same final\nresults for the charm quark mass and have an uncertainty of about 1%.\n", "  Liquids in contact with solids are submitted to intermolecular forces making\nliquids heterogeneous and stress tensors are not any more spherical as in\nhomogeneous bulks. The aim of this article is to show that a square-gradient\nfunctional representing liquid-vapor interface free energy corrected with a\nliquid density functional at solid surfaces is a well adapted model to study\nstructures of very thin nanofilms near solid walls. This result makes it\npossible to study the motions of liquids in nanolayers and to generalize the\napproximation of lubrication in long wave hypothesis.\n", "  We summarize the present phenomenology of Sivers and Collins effects for\ntransverse single spin asymmetries in polarized proton-proton collisions within\nthe framework of the generalized parton model (GPM). We will discuss a\nreassessment of the Collins effect and some preliminary predictions for SSA's\nin p(pol) p -> pi,K + X processes at RHIC obtained using updated information\nfrom SIDIS data and a new set of meson fragmentation functions.\n", "  In this lecture we discuss various aspects of QCD at nonzero chemical\npotential, including its phase diagram and the Dirac spectrum, and summarize\nwhat chiral random matrix theory has contributed to this subject. To illustrate\nthe importance of the phase of the fermion determinant, we particularly\nhighlight the differences between QCD and phase quenched QCD.\n", "  We explore some general consequences of a consistent formulation of\nrelativistic quantum field theory (QFT) on the Groenewold-Moyal-Weyl\nnoncommutative versions of Minkowski space with covariance under the twisted\nPoincare' group of Chaichian et al. [12], Wess [44], Koch et al. [31], Oeckl\n[34]. We argue that a proper enforcement of the latter requires braided\ncommutation relations between any pair of coordinates $\\hat x,\\hat y$\ngenerating two different copies of the space, or equivalently a $\\star$-tensor\nproduct $f(x)\\star g(y)$ (in the parlance of Aschieri et al. [3]) between any\ntwo functions depending on $x,y$. Then all differences $(x-y)^\\mu$ behave like\ntheir undeformed counterparts. Imposing (minimally adapted) Wightman axioms one\nfinds that the $n$-point functions fulfill the same general properties as on\ncommutative space. Actually, upon computation one finds (at least for scalar\nfields) that the $n$-point functions remain unchanged as functions of the\ncoordinates' differences both if fields are free and if they interact (we treat\ninteractions via time-ordered perturbation theory). The main, surprising\noutcome seems a QFT physically equivalent to the undeformed counterpart (to\nconfirm it or not one should however first clarify the relation between\n$n$-point functions and observables, in particular S-matrix elements).\n  These results are mainly based on a joint work [24] with J. Wess\n", "  Exact solution of the modified Dirac equation in rotating medium is found in\npolar coordinates in the limit of vanishing neutrino mass. The solution for the\nactive left-handed particle exhibit properties similar to those peculiar for\nthe charged particle moving in the presence of a constant magnetic field.\nAccordingly, the particle in the rotating matter has circle orbits with energy\nlevels, analogous to the Landau levels in magnetic field. The relevant physical\nrealization of the problem is motion of neutrino inside the rotating neutron\nstar. The feature of such motion to form binding states leads to the prediction\nof the new mechanism for neutrino trapping. The solution found can be used for\ndetailed description of relativistic and nearly massless neutrino dynamics in\nneutron stars. Results obtained further develop the \"method of exact solutions\"\nin application to particle interactions in presence of dense matter.\n", "  A confining gauge theory violates the completeness of asymptotic states held\nas foundation points of the $S$-matrix. Spin-dependent experiments can yield\nresults that appear to violate quantum mechanics. The point is illustrated by\nviolation of the Soffer bound in $QCD$. Experimental confirmation that the\nbound is violated would be a discovery of immense importance, sweeping away\nfundamental assumptions of strong interaction physics held for the past 50\nyears.\n", "  In 1995, the top quark was discovered at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider by\nthe CDF and D0 collaborations in the ppbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.8 TeV using\nabout 50pb^-1 of data per experiment. We present the studies of the top quark\nproperties based on 1fb^-1 of data collected by the D0 experiment at a center\nof mass energy of 1.96TeV. The increased statistics and higher collision energy\nallow to perform precision measurements of the top quark production and decay\ncharacteristics and open the possibility to probe physics beyond the Standard\nModel in the top quark sector. The presentation mainly focuses on the\nmeasurement of the top pair production cross section and branching fraction of\nthe top quark decays, a search for ttbar resonances, and the measurement of the\ntop quark pair production cross section ratio and its interpretation in terms\nof new physics.\n", "  Exclusive pi0 electroproduction from nucleons can be related to transversity,\nthe tensor charge, and other quantities related to transversity. This process\nisolates C-parity odd and chiral odd combinations of t-channel exchange quantum\nnumbers. In a hadronic picture the meson production amplitudes for intermediate\nenergy and Q are determined by C-odd Regge exchanges with final state\ninteractions. The helicity structure for this C-odd process relates to the\nquark helicity flip, or chiral odd generalized parton distributions\n(GPDs).Various cross sections and asymmetries will be sensitive to the\ntransversity.\n", "  Strongly correlated states in many-body systems are traditionally created\nusing elastic interparticle interactions. Here we show that inelastic\ninteractions between particles can also drive a system into the strongly\ncorrelated regime. This is shown by an experimental realization of a specific\nstrongly correlated system, namely a one-dimensional molecular Tonks-Girardeau\ngas.\n", "  We construct the general vortex solution in a fully-Higgsed, color-flavor\nlocked vacuum of a non-Abelian gauge theory, where the gauge group is taken to\nbe the product of an arbitrary simple group and U(1), with a Fayet-Iliopoulos\nterm. The strict correspondence between vortices and lumps in the associated\nNon-Linear Sigma-Model which arise in the limit of strong coupling is pointed\nout. The construction of the vortex moduli space is derived here as a\nconsequence of this correspondence.\n", "  In a reasonably self-contained and explicit presentation we illustrate the\nefficiency of the Feynman-Kac formula for the rigorous derivation of three\ninequalities of interest in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.\n", "  In many experiments isolated atoms and ions have been inserted into\nhigh-finesse optical resonators for the study of fundamental quantum optics and\nquantum information. Here, we introduce another application of such a system,\nas the realization of cavity optomechanics where the collective motion of an\natomic ensemble serves the role of a moveable optical element in an optical\nresonator. Compared with other optomechanical systems, such as those\nincorporating nanofabricated cantilevers or the large cavity mirrors of\ngravitational observatories, our cold-atom realization offers direct access to\nthe quantum regime. We describe experimental investigations of optomechanical\neffects, such as the bistability of collective atomic motion and the first\nquantification of measurement backaction for a macroscopic object, and discuss\nfuture directions for this nascent field.\n", "  The path integral approach is used for the calculation of the correlation\nfunctions of the $XY$ Heisenberg chain. The obtained answers for the two-point\ncorrelators of the $XX$ magnet are of the determinantal form and are\ninterpreted in terms of the generating functions for the random turns vicious\nwalkers.\n", "  Interactions between non-BPS non-Abelian vortices are studied in non-Abelian\nU(1) x SU(N) extensions of the Abelian-Higgs model in four dimensions. In\naddition to the usual type I/II Abelian superconductors, we find other two new\nregimes: type I*/II*.\n", "  The exclusive diffractive production of vector mesons and real photons in ep\ncollisions has been studied at HERA in a wide kinematic range. The most recent\nexperimental results are presented.\n", "  Radio-frequency electric-dipole transitions between nearly degenerate,\nopposite parity levels of atomic dysprosium (Dy) were monitored over an\neight-month period to search for a variation in the fine-structure constant,\n$\\alpha$. The data provide a rate of fractional temporal variation of $\\alpha$\nof $(-2.4\\pm2.3)\\times10^{-15}$ yr$^{-1}$ or a value of $(-7.8 \\pm 5.9) \\times\n10^{-6}$ for $k_\\alpha$, the variation coefficient for $\\alpha$ in a changing\ngravitational potential. All results indicate the absence of significant\nvariation at the present level of sensitivity. We also present initial results\non laser cooling of an atomic beam of dysprosium.\n", "  The roles of the Drell-Yan experiments in studying the\nTransverse-Momentum-Dependent (TMD) parton distributions are discussed. Recent\nresults from the Fermilab E866 experiment on the angular distributions of\nDrell-Yan dimuons in $p+p$ and $p+d$ at 800 GeV/c are presented. These data are\ncompared with the pion-induced Drell-Yan data, and with models which attribute\nthe $\\cos 2 \\phi$ azimuthal distribution to the presence of the\ntransverse-momentum-dependent Boer-Mulders structure function $h_1^\\perp$.\nConstraints on the magnitude of the sea-quark $h_1^\\perp$ structure functions\nare obtained. Future prospects for studying the TMDs with Drell-Yan experiments\nat Fermilab and J-PARC are also discussed.\n", "  As a consequence of a general trend in the physics of oscillators and clocks\ntowards optics, phase and frequency metrology is rapidly moving to optics too.\nYet, optics is not replacing the traditional radio-frequency (RF) and microwave\ndomains. Instead, it adds tough challenges. Precision frequency-stability\nmeasurements are chiefly based on the measurement of phase noise, which is the\nmain focus of this article. Major progress has been achieved in two main areas.\nThe first is the extreme low-noise measurements, based on the bridge\n(interferometric) method in real time or with sophisticated correlation and\naveraging techniques. The second is the emerging field of microwave photonics,\nwhich combines optics and RF/microwaves. This includes the femtosecond laser,\nthe two-way fiber links, the noise measurement systems based on the fiber and\nthe photonic oscillator. Besides, the phenomenology of flicker (1/f) noise is\nbetter understood, though the ultimate reasons are still elusive.\n", "  We investigated the measurement floor and link stability for the transfer of\nan ultra-stable optical frequency via an optical fiber link. We achieved a\nnear-delay-limited instability of 3x10^(-15)/(tau x Hz) for 147 km deployed\nfiber, and 10^(-20) (integrations time tau = 4000 s) for the noise floor.\n", "  A universal characterization of interactions in few- and many-body quantum\nsystems is often possible without detailed description of the interaction\npotential, and has become a defacto assumption for cold atom research.\nUniversality in this context is defined as the validity to fully characterize\nthe system in terms of two-body scattering length. We discuss universality in\nthe following three contexts: closed-channel dominated Feshbach resonance,\nEfimov physics near Feshbach resonances, and corrections to the mean field\nenergy of Bose-Einstein condensates with large scattering lengths. Novel\nexperimental tools and strategies are discussed to study universality in\nultracold atomic gases: dynamic control of interactions, run-away evaporative\ncooling in optical traps, and preparation of few-body systems in optical\nlattices.\n", "  Contrary to wide-spread opinion that the final state interaction (FSI)\nenhances the amplitude $<2\\pi;I=0|K^0>$, we argue that FSI does not increase\nthe absolute value of this amplitude.\n", "  We use Bloch oscillations to transfer coherently many photon momenta to\natoms. Then we can measure accurately the recoil velocity $\\hbar k/m$ and\ndeduce the fine structure constant $\\alpha$. The velocity variation due to\nBloch oscillations is measured using atom interferometry. This method yields to\na value of the fine structure constant $\\alpha^{-1}= 137.035 999 45 (62)$ with\na relative uncertainty of about $4.5 \\times 10^{-9}$.\n", "  In 1986 Alex Dalgarno published a paper entitled \"Is Interstellar Chemistry\nUseful?\" By the middle 1970s, and perhaps even earlier, Alex had hoped that\nastronomical molecules would prove to: possess significant diagnostic utility;\ncontrol many of the environments in which they exist; stimulate a wide variety\nof physicists and chemists who are at least as fascinated by the mechanisms\nforming and removing the molecules as by astronomy. His own research efforts\nhave contributed greatly to the realization of that hope. This paper contains a\nfew examples of: how molecules are used to diagnose large-scale dynamics in\nastronomical sources including star forming regions and supernovae; the ways in\nwhich molecular processes control the evolution of astronomical objects such as\ndense cores destined to become stars and very evolved giant stars; theoretical\nand laboratory investigations that elucidate the processes producing and\nremoving astronomical molecules and allow their detection.\n", "  The 7.6-eV-isomer of Thorium-229 offers the opportunity to perform high\nresolution laser spectroscopy of a nuclear transition. We give a brief review\nof the investigations of this isomer. The nuclear resonance connecting ground\nstate and isomer may be used as the reference of an optical clock of very high\naccuracy using trapped and laser-cooled thorium ions, or in a compact\nsolid-state optical frequency standard of high stability.\n", "  This talk reviewed some classic results and recent progress in the\nresummation of leading and nonleading enhancements in QCD cross sections and of\npoles in dimensionally-regularized hard-scattering amplitudes.\n", "  A concise introduction is given to the standard model, including the\nstructure of the QCD and electroweak Lagrangians, spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking, experimental tests, and problems.\n", "  Graphene is a fascinating material for exploring fundamental science\nquestions as well as a potential building block for novel electronic\napplications. In order to realize the full potential of this material the\nfabrication techniques of graphene devices, still in their infancy, need to be\nrefined to better isolate the graphene layer from the environment. We present\nresults from a study on the influence of extrinsic factors on the quality of\ngraphene devices including material defects, lithography, doping by metallic\nleads and the substrate. The main finding is that trapped Coulomb scatterers\nassociated with the substrate are the primary factor reducing the quality of\ngraphene devices. A fabrication scheme is proposed to produce high quality\ngraphene devices dependably and reproducibly. In these devices, the transport\nproperties approach theoretical predictions of ballistic transport.\n", "  In coherent radiation sources (diffraction radiation, Smith-Purcell effect,\netc.) based on relativistic electrons passing by a material radiator, the\nelectron self-field is partly shadowed after each part of the radiator over a\ndistance of the order of the formation length g2l. This effect has been\ninvestigated on coherent diffraction radiation (DR) by electron bunches. An\nabsorbing half-plane screen was placed at various distances L before a standard\nDR source (inclined half-plane mirror). The DR intensity was reduced when the\nscreen was at small L and on the same side as the mirror. No reduction was\nobserved when the screen was on the opposite side. The shadowing effect can\nsignificantly reduce the total energy radiated in a long radiator.\n", "  The problem of the surface current excitation in a conductive targets by a\nrelativistic electron electric field as the origin of such radiation mechanisms\nas diffraction and transition radiation of relativistic electron was considered\nin frame of both surface current and pseudo-photon methods. The contradiction\nbetween these viewpoints in respect to the surface current on the target\ndownstream surface necessitated the experimental test of this phenomenon. The\ntest performed on electron beam of the 6 MeV microtron showed, that not any\nsurface current is induced on the target downstream surface under the influence\nof a relativistic electron electromagnetic field in contrast to the upstream\nsurface. This is important implication for the understanding of the forward\ntransition and diffraction radiation nature.\n", "  The electromagnetic wave field propagating in a helical wave guide is\ndecomposed in an angular momentum basis. Eigenmodes are calculated using a\ntruncation in $l$ and a discretisation of the boundary condition. Modes\nslightly slower than light are considered for relativistic particle\nacceleration.\n", "  In this paper we develop an analytical framework for the study of\nelectrochemical impedance of mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIEC). The\nframework is based on first-principles and it features the coupling of\nelectrochemical reactions, surface transport and bulk transport processes. We\nutilize this work to analyze two dimensional systems relevant for fuel cell\nscience via finite element method (FEM). Alternate current Impedance\nSpectroscopy (IS) of a ceria symmetric cell is simulated near equilibrium\ncondition (zero bias) for a wide array of working conditions including\nvariations of temperature and $H_2$ partial pressure on a two dimensional fuel\ncell sample with patterned metal electrodes. The model shows agreement of IS\ncurves with the experimental literature with the relative error on the\nimpedance being consistently below 2%. Important two-dimensional effects such\nthe effects of thickness decrease and the influence of variable electronic and\nionic diffusivities on the impedance spectra are also explored.\n", "  The dynamics of the Reynolds stress tensor for turbulent flows is described\nwith an evolution equation coupling both geometric effects and turbulent source\nterms. The effects of the mean flow geometry are shown up when the source terms\nare neglected: the Reynolds stress tensor is then expressed as the sum of three\ntensor products of vector fields which are governed by a distorted gyroscopic\nequation. Along the mean flow trajectories, the fluctuations of velocity are\ndescribed by differential equations whose coefficients depend only on the mean\nflow deformation. If the mean flow vorticity is small enough, an approximate\nturbulence model is derived, and its application to shear shallow water flows\nis proposed. Moreover, the approximate turbulence model admits a variational\nformulation which is similar to the one of capillary fluids.\n", "  We show theoretically that nearly indistinguishable photons can be generated\nwith non-identical semiconductor-based sources. The use of virtual Raman\ntransitions and the optimization of the external driving fields increases the\ntolerance to spectral inhomogeneity to the meV energy range. A trade-off\nemerges between photon indistinguishability and efficiency in the\nphoton-generation process. Linear (quadratic) dependence of the coincidence\nprobability within the Hong-Ou-Mandel setup is found with respect to the\ndephasing (relaxation) rate in the semiconductor sources.\n", "  We study a composite multimode light-two-level atom system in a cavity. We\nshow that coupling of the two-level atom to multiple modes of the light\ndestroys the Mott phase of the composite system thus making the system less\nuseful platform for developing concepts in quantum information processing.\n", "  We describe high-Tc superconductivity in layered materials within a BCS\ntheory as a BEC of massless-like Cooper pairons satisfying a linear dispersion\nrelation, and propagating within quasi-2D layers of finite width defined by the\ncharge distribution about the CuO_2 planes. We obtain a closed formula for the\ncritical temperature, Tc, that depends on the layer width, the binding energy\nof Cooper's pairs, and the average in-plane penetration depth. This formula\nreasonably reproduces empirical values of superconducting transition\ntemperatures for several different cuprate materials near the optimal doping\nregime, as well as for YBCO films with different doping degrees.\n", "  In this talk relativistic corrections due to Geroch-Hansen multipoles for\nperihelion precession and node line precession of orbits in a stationary\naxially symmetric vacuum spacetime endowed with a plane of symmetry will be\nshown. Patterns of regularity will be discussed.\n", "  We report the development of a fiber-based single spatial mode source of\nphoton-pairs where the efficiency of extracting photon-pairs is improved over a\nprevious source [18] through the use of fiber-end expansion and Bragg filters.\nThis improvement in efficiency enabled a spectrally bright and pure photon-pair\nsource having a small second-order correlation function (0.03) and a raw\nspectral brightness of 44,700 pairs/(s nm mW). The source can be configured to\ngenerate entangled photon-pairs,characterized via optimal and minimal quantum\nstate tomography, to have a fidelity of 97% and tangle of 92%, without\nsubtracting any background.\n", "  These lectures, presented at TASI 08 school, provide an introduction to\nsupersymmetry and supersymmetry breaking. We present basic formalism of\nsupersymmetry, supersymmetric non-renormalization theorems, and summarize\nnon-perturbative dynamics of supersymmetric QCD. We then turn to discussion of\ntree level, non-perturbative, and metastable supersymmetry breaking. We\nintroduce Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and discuss soft parameters in\nthe Lagrangian. Finally we discuss several mechanisms for communicating the\nsupersymmetry breaking between the hidden and visible sectors.\n", "  The set of solutions inferred by the generic maximum entropy (MaxEnt) or\nmaximum relative entropy (MaxREnt) principles of Jaynes - considered as a\nfunction of the moment constraints or their conjugate Lagrangian multipliers -\nis endowed with a Riemannian geometric description, based on the second\ndifferential tensor of the entropy or its Legendre transform (negative Massieu\nfunction). The analysis provides a generalised {\\it least action bound}\napplicable to all Jaynesian systems, which provides a lower bound to the cost\n(in generic entropy units) of a transition between inferred positions along a\nspecified path, at specified rates of change of the control parameters. The\nanalysis therefore extends the concepts of \"finite time thermodynamics\" to the\ngeneric Jaynes domain, providing a link between purely static (stationary)\ninferred positions of a system, and dynamic transitions between these positions\n(as a function of time or some other coordinate). If the path is unspecified,\nthe analysis gives an absolute lower bound for the cost of the transition,\ncorresponding to the geodesic of the Riemannian hypersurface. The analysis is\napplied to (i) an equilibrium thermodynamic system subject to mean internal\nenergy and volume constraints, and (ii) a flow system at steady state, subject\nto constraints on the mean heat, mass and momentum fluxes and chemical reaction\nrates. The first example recovers the {\\it minimum entropy cost} of a\ntransition between equilibrium positions, a widely used result of finite-time\nthermodynamics. The second example leads to a new {\\it minimum entropy\nproduction principle}, for the cost of a transition between steady state\npositions of a flow system.\n", "  A metal-encapsulating silicon fullerene, Eu@Si20, has been predicted by\ndensity functional theory to be by far the most stable fullerene-like silicon\nstructure. The Eu@Si20 structure is a dodecahedron with D2h symmetry in which\nthe europium atom occupies the center site. The calculated results show that\nthe europium atom has a large magnetic moment of nearly 7.0 Bohr magnetons. In\naddition, it was found that a stable \"pearl necklace\" nanowire, constructed by\nconcatenating a series of Eu@Si20 units, with the central europium atom,\nretains the high spin moment. The magnetic structure of the nanowire indicates\npotential applications in the fields of spintronics and high-density magnetic\nstorage.\n", "  Since the first experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensation in\ncold atomic gases in 1995 there has been a surge of activity in this field.\nIngenious experiments have allowed us to probe matter close to zero temperature\nand reveal some of the fascinating effects quantum mechanics has bestowed on\nnature. It is a challenge for mathematical physicists to understand these\nvarious phenomena from first principles, that is, starting from the underlying\nmany-body Schr\\\"odinger equation. Recent progress in this direction concerns\nmainly equilibrium properties of dilute, cold quantum gases. We shall explain\nsome of the results in this article, and describe the mathematics involved in\nunderstanding these phenomena. Topics include the ground state energy and the\nfree energy at positive temperature, the effect of interparticle interaction on\nthe critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation, as well as the\noccurrence of superfluidity and quantized vortices in rapidly rotating gases.\n", "  We study four dimensional N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory in the\nOmega-background with the two dimensional N=2 super-Poincare invariance. We\nexplain how this gauge theory provides the quantization of the classical\nintegrable system underlying the moduli space of vacua of the ordinary four\ndimensional N=2 theory.\n  The epsilon-parameter of the Omega-background is identified with the Planck\nconstant, the twisted chiral ring maps to quantum Hamiltonians, the\nsupersymmetric vacua are identified with Bethe states of quantum integrable\nsystems. This four dimensional gauge theory in its low energy description has\ntwo dimensional twisted superpotential which becomes the Yang-Yang function of\nthe integrable system. We present the thermodynamic-Bethe-ansatz like formulae\nfor these functions and for the spectra of commuting Hamiltonians following the\ndirect computation in gauge theory. The general construction is illustrated at\nthe examples of the many-body systems, such as the periodic Toda chain, the\nelliptic Calogero-Moser system, and their relativistic versions, for which we\npresent a complete characterization of the L^2-spectrum. We very briefly\ndiscuss the quantization of Hitchin system.\n", "  In the context of the Randall-Sundrum braneworld, an exhaustive and detailed\ndescription of the approach based in the minimal anisotropic consequence onto\nthe brane, which has been successfully used to generate exact interior\nsolutions to Einstein's field equations for static and non-uniform braneworld\nstars with local and non-local bulk terms, is carefully presented. It is shown\nthat this approach allows the generation of a braneworld version for any known\ngeneral relativistic solution.\n", "  We present a brief overview of black hole spacetimes admitting Killing-Yano\ntensors. In vacuum these include Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics and certain black brane\nsolutions. In the presence of matter fields, (conformal) Killing-Yano\nsymmetries are known to exist for the Plebanski-Demianski solution and\n(trivially) for any spacetime with spherical symmetry. Special attention is\ndevoted to generalized Killing-Yano tensors of black holes in minimal gauged\nsupergravity. Several aspects directly related to the existence of Killing-Yano\ntensors, such as the Kerr-Schild form, algebraic type of spacetimes, and\nseparability of field equations, are also briefly discussed.\n", "  We discuss finite local extensions of quantum field theories in low space\ntime dimensions in connection with categorical structures and the question of\nmodular invariants in conformal field theory, also touching upon purely\nmathematical ramifications.\n", "  We consider $N\\times N$ symmetric or hermitian random matrices with\nindependent, identically distributed entries where the probability distribution\nfor each matrix element is given by a measure $\\nu$ with a subexponential\ndecay. We prove that the local eigenvalue statistics in the bulk of the\nspectrum for these matrices coincide with those of the Gaussian Orthogonal\nEnsemble (GOE) and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), respectively, in the\nlimit $N\\to \\infty$. Our approach is based on the study of the Dyson Brownian\nmotion via a related new dynamics, the local relaxation flow. We also show that\nthe Wigner semicircle law holds locally on the smallest possible scales and we\nprove that eigenvectors are fully delocalized and eigenvalues repel each other\non arbitrarily small scales.\n", "  We review a recent result on Rieffel's deformation quantization by actions of\nR^d: it is shown that for every state omega_0 of the undeformed C*-algebra A_0\nthere is a continuous section of states omega(hbar) through omega_0. We outline\nthe physical interpretation in terms of quantization.\n", "  We present a recent result on the existence of the dynamics in the\nthermodynamic limit of a class of anharmonic quantum oscillator lattices, which\nwas obtained using Lieb--Robinson bounds.\n", "  One of the central challenges in kinetic theory is the derivation of\nmacroscopic evolution equations--describing, for example, the dynamics of an\nelectron gas--from the underlying fundamental microscopic laws of classical or\nquantum mechanics. An iconic mathematical model in this research area is the\nLorentz gas, which describes an ensemble of non-interacting point particles in\nan infinite array of spherical scatterers. In the case of a disordered\nscatterer configuration, the classical results by Gallavotti, Spohn and\nBoldrighini-Bunimovich-Sinai show that the time evolution of a macroscopic\nparticle cloud is governed, in the limit of small scatterer density\n(Boltzmann-Grad limit), by the linear Boltzmann equation. In this lecture I\nwill discuss the recent discovery that for a periodic configuration of\nscatterers the linear Boltzmann equation fails, and the random flight process\nthat emerges in the Boltzmann-Grad limit is substantially more complicated. The\nkey ingredient in the description of the limiting stochastic process is the\nrenormalization dynamics on the space of lattices, a powerful technique that\nhas recently been successfully applied also to other open problems in\nmathematical physics, including KAM theory and quantum chaos. This lecture is\nbased on joint work with Andreas Strombergsson, Uppsala.\n", "  We review QFT from the algebraic structure of its perturbative expansion and\npoint out three new results.\n", "  Defects are a useful tool in the study of quantum field theories. This is\nillustrated in the example of two-dimensional conformal field theories. We\ndescribe how defect lines and their junction points appear in the description\nof symmetries and order-disorder dualities, as well as in the orbifold\nconstruction and a generalisation thereof that covers exceptional modular\ninvariants.\n", "  We suggest how versions of Schramm's SLE can be used to describe the scaling\nlimit of some off-critical 2D lattice models. Many open questions remain.\n", "  We present some recent results concerning the persistence of dynamical\nlocalization for disordered systems of n particles under weak interactions.\n", "  We show that, under very general definitions of a kinetic energy operator\n$T$, the Lieb-Thirring inequalities for sums of eigenvalues of $T-V$ can be\nderived from the Sobolev inequality appropriate to that choice of $T$.\n", "  We consider the two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau functional with constant\napplied magnetic field. For applied magnetic fields close to the second\ncritical field $H_{C_2}$ and large Ginzburg-Landau parameter, we provide\nleading order estimates on the energy of minimizing configurations. We obtain a\nfine threshold value of the applied magnetic field for which bulk\nsuperconductivity contributes to the leading order of the energy. Furthermore,\nthe energy of the bulk is related to that of the Abrikosov problem in a\nperiodic lattice. A key ingredient of the proof is a novel $L^\\infty$-bound\nwhich is of independent interest.\n", "  This contribution gives a brief overview of the theoretical ideas underlying\nour current understanding of the early Universe. Confronting the predictions of\nthe early Universe models with cosmological observations, in particular of the\ncosmic microwave background fluctuations, will improve our knowledge about the\nphysics of the primordial Universe.\n", "  The stationary solutions of a large variety of (super)gravity theories can be\ndescribed within a non-linear sigma model G / H* coupled to Euclidean gravity\nin three-dimensions, for which G is a simple group and H* a non-compact real\nform of its maximal compact subgroup. The absence of naked singularities in\nfour dimensions requires the G Noether charge in 3D to satisfy a characteristic\nequation that determines it in function of the mass, the NUT charge and the\nelectro-magnetic charges of the solution. It follows that the Noether charge\nassociated to extremal black holes must lie in a certain Lagrangian submanifold\nof a nilpotent orbit of G. Constructing a suitable parameterisation of this\nLagrangian, we are able to determine the so-called `fake superpotential' that\ngoverns the radial dependency of the scalar fields.\n", "  We report on our recent progress on the manipulation of single rubidium atoms\ntrapped in optical tweezers and the generation of entanglement between two\natoms, each individually trapped in neighboring tweezers. To create an\nentangled state of two atoms in their ground states, we make use of the Rydberg\nblockade mechanism. The degree of entanglement is measured using global\nrotations of the internal states of both atoms. Such internal state rotations\non a single atom are demonstrated with a high fidelity.\n", "  We report on our recent rigorous construction of complete renormalization\ngroup trajectories between two fixed points for the three-dimensional phi-four\nmodel with modified propagator considered by Brydges, Mitter and Scoppola\n(BMS). These are discrete critical trajectories which connect the ultraviolet\nGaussian fixed point to the nontrivial BMS infrared fixed point which is an\nanalogue of the Wilson--Fisher fixed point. The renormalization group map is\ndefined rigorously and nonperturbatively, without using the hierarchical\napproximation. The trajectories are constructed by a fixed point argument in a\nsuitable Banach space of sequences, where one perturbs a nonlinear\none-dimensional iteration.\n", "  We adopt the Dirac model for graphene and calculate the Casimir interaction\nenergy between a plane suspended graphene sample and a parallel plane ideal\nconductor. We employ both the Quantum Field Theory (QFT) approach, and the\nLifshitz formula generalizations. The first approach turns out to be the\nleading order in the coupling constant of the second one. The Casimir\ninteraction for this system appears to be rather weak but experimentally\nmeasurable. It exhibits a strong dependence on the mass of the quasi-particles\nin graphene.\n", "  We review recent results on lattice models for spin-less fermions with strong\nrepulsive interactions. A judicious tuning of kinetic and interaction terms\nleads to a model possessing supersymmetry. In the 1D case, this model displays\ncritical behavior described by superconformal field theory. On 2D lattices we\ngenerically find superfrustration, characterized by an extensive ground state\nentropy. For certain 2D lattices analytical results on the ground state\nstructure reveal yet another quantum phase, which we tentatively call\n'supertopological'.\n", "  We review some recent results concerning the derivation of effective\nevolution equations from first principle quantum dynamics. In particular, we\ndiscuss the derivation of the Hartree equation for mean field systems and the\nderivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the time evolution of\nBose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  We study the field theoretical model of a scalar field in presence of spacial\ninhomogeneities in form of one and two finite width mirrors (material slabs).\nThe interaction of the scalar field with the defect is described with\nposition-dependent mass term. Within this model we derive the interaction of\ntwo finite width mirrors, establish the correspondence of the model to the\nLifshitz formula and construct limiting procedure to obtain finite self-energy\nof a single mirror without any normalization condition.\n", "  We investigate non-perturbative pair production from vacuum (the Schwinger\neffect) in the focal region of two counter-propagating, ultra-short laser\npulses with sub-cycle structure. We use the quantum kinetic formulation to\ncalculate the momentum spectrum of created particles and show the extreme\nsensitivity to the laser frequency $\\omega$, the pulse length $\\tau$ and the\ncarrier-envelope absolute phase $\\phi$. We apply this formalism to both\nfermions and bosons to illustrate the influence of quantum statistics in this\ntype of electric background field.\n", "  Various infinite-dimensional versions of Calogero-Moser operator are\ndiscussed in relation with the theory of symmetric functions and representation\ntheory of basic classical Lie superlagebras. This is a version of invited talk\ngiven by the second author at XVI International Congress on Mathematical\nPhysics in Prague, August 2009.\n", "  Different non-equilibrium situations have recently been considered when\nstudying the thermal Casimir--Polder interaction with a body. We show that the\nKeldysh Green function method provides a very general common framework for such\nstudies where non-equilibrium of either the atom or the body with the\nenvironment can be accounted for. We apply the results to the case of ground\nstate polar molecules out of equilibrium with their environment, observing\nseveral striking effects. We consider thermal Casimir--Polder potentials in\nplanar configurations, and new results for a molecule in a cylindrical cavity\nare reported, showing similar characteristic behaviour as found in planar\ngeometry.\n", "  Electrons and holes in clean, charge-neutral graphene behave like a strongly\ncoupled relativistic liquid. The thermo-electric transport properties of the\ninteracting Dirac quasiparticles are rather special, being constrained by an\nemergent Lorentz covariance at hydrodynamic frequency scales. At small carrier\ndensity and high temperatures, graphene exhibits signatures of a quantum\ncritical system with an inelastic scattering rate set only by temperature, a\nconductivity with a nearly universal value, solely due to electron-hole\nfriction, and a very low viscosity. In this regime one finds pronounced\ndeviations from standard Fermi liquid behavior. These results, obtained by\nBoltzmann transport theory at weak electron-electron coupling, are fully\nconsistent with the predictions of relativistic hydrodynamics. Interestingly,\nvery analogous behavior is found in certain strongly coupled relativistic\nliquids, which can be analyzed exactly via the AdS-CFT correspondence, and\nwhich had helped identifying and establishing the peculiar properties of\ngraphene.\n", "  We discuss the scalar analogue of the Casimir-Polder force between a sphere\nand a uniaxially corrugated surface with Dirichlet boundary conditions.\nPresenting a formulation that is nonperturbative in the height profile of the\nsurface, we give explicit numerical results for a sinuosoidal corrugation\nprofile.\n", "  In recent years, the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian has been shown to be a\nuseful tool for the analysis of the asymptotic growth of the N-photon\namplitudes at large N. Moreover, certain results and conjectures on its\nimaginary part allow one, using Borel analysis, to make predictions for those\namplitudes at large loop orders. Extending work by G.V. Dunne and one of the\nauthors to the three-loop level, but in the simpler context of 1+1 dimensional\nQED, we calculate the corresponding Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, analyse its\nweak field expansion, and study the congruence with predictions obtained from\nworldline instantons. We discuss the relevance of these issues for Cvitanovic's\nconjecture.\n", "  We theoretically prove that electromagnetic beams propagating through a\nnonlinear cubic metamaterial can exhibit a power flow whose direction reverses\nits sign along the transverse profile. This effect is peculiar of the hitherto\nunexplored extreme nonlinear regime where the nonlinear response is comparable\nor even greater than the linear contribution, a condition achievable even at\nrelatively small intensities. We propose a possible metamaterial structure able\nto support the extreme conditions where the polarization cubic nonlinear\ncontribution does not act as a mere perturbation of the linear part.\n", "  In this paper we will present very recent results obtained in the ambit of\nquantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime. We utilize a newly developed\nnon-perturbative heat kernel asymptotic expansion on homogeneous Abelian\nbundles over Riemannian manifolds in order to compute the one-loop effective\naction for scalar and spinor fields in curved spacetime under the influence of\na strong covariantly constant electromagnetic field. In this framework we\nderived, in particular, the gravitational corrections, up to linear terms in\nRiemannian curvature, to Schwinger's result for the creation of particles in a\nstrong electric field.\n", "  The Casimir effect is investigated in cylindrical and toroidal carbon\nnanotubes within the framework of the Dirac-like model for the electronic\nstates. The topological Casimir energy is positive for metallic cylindrical\nnanotubes and is negative for semiconducting ones. The toroidal\ncompactification of a cylindrical nanotube along its axis increases the Casimir\nenergy for metallic-type (periodic) boundary conditions along its axis and\ndecreases the Casimir energy for the semiconducting-type compactifications. For\nfinite length metallic nanotubes the Casimir forces acting on the tube edges\nare always attractive, whereas for semiconducting-type ones they are attractive\nfor small lengths of the nanotube and repulsive for large lengths.\n", "  We investigate the vacuum expectation values of the field squared and the\nenergy-momentum tensor for a massless scalar field with general curvature\ncoupling parameter in spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes with\nan arbitrary number of toroidally compactified dimensions. When the comoving\nlengths of the compact dimensions are short compared to the Hubble length, the\ntopological parts coincide with those for a conformal coupling. This limit\ncorresponds to the adiabatic approximation. In the opposite limit of large\ncomoving lengths of the compact dimensions, in dependence of the curvature\ncoupling parameter, two regimes are realized with monotonic or oscillatory\nbehavior of the vacuum expectation values.\n", "  A summary of recent calculations of Casimir forces between a collection of\n$N$-dielectric spheres is presented. This is done by evaluating directly the\nforce on a sphere constructed from a stress tensor, rather than an interaction\nenergy. A loop integral formulation is also discussed where we rewrite the\nexpressions for the force in terms of loop integrals for the effective\nclassical propagation of the electric and magnetic fields.\n", "  The Wiener measure induces a measure of closed, convex, (d-1)-dimensional,\nEuclidean (hyper-)surfaces that are the convex hulls of closed d-dimensional\nBrownian bridges. I present arguments and numerical evidence that this measure,\nfor odd d, is generated by a local classical action of length dimension two\nthat depends on geometric invariants of the (d-1)-dimensional surface only.\n", "  We examine recent prescriptions for estimating the thermal Casimir force\nbetween two metallic plates from the point of view of their consistency with\nthe Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem of classical statistical physics. We find that\nprescriptions including the effect of ohmic dissipation satisfy the theorem,\nwhile prescriptions that neglect ohmic dissipation do not.\n", "  Emphasizing first the utility of the generalized Fresnel coefficients in the\ntheory of the Casimir effect in planar cavities, we complement our previous\ndiscussion of the ordinary Casimir force on and the Casimir stress in a metal\n(plasma) slab in a planar cavity. We demonstrate strong dependence of the\nCasimir stress in a thin slab on properties of the bounding medium in the\nsymmetric Lifshitz configuration. Contrary to this, the stress in a thick slab\ngradually becomes insensitive on external boundary conditions. We also consider\nthe position dependence of the Casimir force on and stress in a thin metal slab\nin a planar cavity. Whereas the force per unit area on the slab strongly\nincreases when it approaches a mirror the stress in the slab decreases and\neventually changes the sign. Generally, the stress decreases with the cavity\nwidth and decreasing reflectivity of the mirrors.\n", "  The Casimir-Polder force between two atoms with equal uniform acceleration\nand separated by a constant distance R is considered. We show that, in the\nlow-acceleration limit, while the near-zone R^{-6} behavior of the interatomic\ninteraction energy is not changed by the acceleration of the atoms, the\nfar-zone interaction energy decreases as R^{-5} instead of the well-known\nR^{-7} behavior for inertial atoms. Possibility of an indirect detection of the\nUnruh effect through measurements of the Casimir-Polder force between the two\naccelerating atoms is also suggested. We also consider a heuristic model for\ncalculating the Casimir-Polder potential energy between the two atoms in the\nhigh-acceleration limit.\n", "  Applying a sum-over-modes approach to the Casimir interaction between two\nplates with finite conductivity, we isolate and study the contributions of\nsurface plasmons and Foucault (eddy current) modes. We show in particular that\nfor the TE-polarization eddy currents provide a repulsive force that cancels,\nat high temperatures, the Casimir free energy calculated with the plasma model.\n", "  We study geometric consistency relations between angles of 3-dimensional (3D)\ncircular quadrilateral lattices -- lattices whose faces are planar\nquadrilaterals inscribable into a circle. We show that these relations generate\ncanonical transformations of a remarkable \"ultra-local\" Poisson bracket algebra\ndefined on discrete 2D surfaces consisting of circular quadrilaterals.\nQuantization of this structure allowed us to obtain new solutions of the\ntetrahedron equation (the 3D analog of the Yang-Baxter equation) as well as\nreproduce all those that were previously known. These solutions generate an\ninfinite number of non-trivial solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation and also\ndefine integrable 3D models of statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.\nThe latter can be thought of as describing quantum fluctuations of lattice\ngeometry.\n", "  We develop a local study of the Green's function and energy density for\nmesons fluctuating around the sine-Gordon kink background.\n", "  We consider Laplace operators on metric graphs, networks of one-dimensional\nline segments (bonds), with matching conditions at the vertices that make the\noperator self-adjoint. Such quantum graphs provide a simple model of quantum\nmechanics in a classically chaotic system with multiple scales corresponding to\nthe lengths of the bonds. For graph Laplacians we briefly report results for\nthe spectral determinant, vacuum energy and heat kernel asymptotics of general\ngraphs in terms of the vertex matching conditions.\n", "  Recently a new caculational scheme for effective actions in radial background\nfields was developed. The effective action is expressed as an infinite sum of\npartial-wave contributions, using the rotational symmetry of the system. The\nsum becomes convergent after proper regularization and renormalization, but the\nrate of convergence is rather slow. We introduce a systematic way of\naccelerating the rate of convergence. This method is based on a radial WKB\nseries in the angular momentum cut-off. We demonstrate the power of this scheme\nby applying it to the calculation of instanton determinant in QCD.\n", "  Interplay between magnetization dynamics and electric current in a conducting\nferromagnet is theoretically studied based on a microscopic model calculation.\nFirst, the effects of the current on magnetization dynamics (spin torques) are\nstudied with special attention to the \"dissipative\" torques arising from\nspin-relaxation processes of conduction electrons. Next, an analysis is given\nof the \"spin motive force\", namely, a spin-dependent 'voltage' generation due\nto magnetization dynamics, which is the reaction to spin torques. Finally, an\nattempt is presented of a unified description of these effects.\n", "  In this talk, we report our present work on the chiral magnetic effect (CME)\nunder a strong magnetic field at low temperature. To this end, we use the\ninstanton vacuum with the finite instanton-number fluctuation Delta, which\nrelates to the nontrivial topological charge Q_t. We compute the vacuum\nexpectation values of the local chiral density <rho_chi>, chiral charge density\n<n_chi> and induced electromagnetic current <j_mu>. We observed that the\nlongitudinal EM current is much larger than the transverse one,\n|j_perp/j_parallel| ~ Q_t, and the <n_chi> equals to the |<j_(3,4)>|. It also\nturns out that the CME becomes insensitive to the magnetic field as T\nincreases, since the instanton effect decreases.\n", "  The recent claim [arXiv:hep-th/0603070, arXiv:hep-th/0605020] that there\nexists in QED a maximum magnetic field of 10^{42} G, above which the magnetized\nvacuum becomes unstable with respect to the so-called \"positronium collapse\" is\ncritically examined and unequivocally refuted.\n", "  We derive a simplified general expression for the two-body scalar Casimir\nenergy in generalized separable coordinate systems. We apply this technique to\nthe case of radial semi-transparent planes in the annular region between two\nconcentric Dirichlet cylinders. This situation is explored both analytically\nand numerically.\n", "  This paper presents an 8 GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) option for\nProject X. It has several advantages over an 8 GeV SC linac. In particular, the\ncost could be lower. With a 2 GeV 10 mA pulsed linac as injector, the RCS would\nbe able to deliver 4 MW beam power for a muon collider. If, instead, a 2 GeV 1\nmA CW linac is used, the RCS would still be able to meet the Project X\nrequirements but it would be difficult for it to serve a muon collider due to\nthe very long injection time.\n", "  Genetically identical cells under the same environmental conditions can show\nstrong variations in protein copy numbers due to inherently stochastic events\nin individual cells. We here develop a theoretical framework to address how\nvariations in enzyme abundance affect the collective kinetics of metabolic\nreactions observed within a population of cells. Kinetic parameters measured at\nthe cell population level are shown to be systematically deviated from those of\nsingle cells, even within populations of homogeneous parameters. Because of\nthese considerations, Michaelis-Menten kinetics can even be inappropriate to\napply at the population level. Our findings elucidate a novel origin of\ndiscrepancy between in vivo and in vitro kinetics, and offer potential utility\nfor analysis of single-cell metabolomic data.\n", "  We use the image charge method to compute the trace of the heat kernel for a\nscalar field on a flat manifold with boundary, representing the trace by means\nof a worldline path integral and obtain useful non-iterative master formulae\nfor n insertions of the scalar potential. We discuss possible extensions of the\nmethod.\n", "  In this paper we review the role of magneto plasmon polaritons in the Casimir\nforce calculations. By applying an external constant magnetic field a strong\noptical anisotropy is induced on two parallel slabs reducing the reflectivity\nand thus the Casimir force. As the external magnetic field increases, the\nCasimir force decreases. Thus, with an an external magnetic field the Casimir\nforce can be controlled.The calculations are done in the Voigt configuration\nwhere the magnetic field is parallel to the slabs. In this configuration the\nreflection coefficients for TE and TM modes do not show mode conversion.\n", "  We have theoretically investigated macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) and\nthe influence of nodal quasiparticles and zero energy bound states (ZES) on MQT\nin s-wave/d-wave hybrid Josephson junctions. In contrast to d-wave/d-wave\njunctions, the low-energy quasiparticle dissipation resulting from nodal\nquasiparticles and ZES is suppressed due to a quasiparticle-tunneling blockade\neffect in an isotropic s-wave superconductor. Therefore, the inherent\ndissipation in these junctions is found to be weak. This result suggests high\npotential of s-wave/d-wave hybrid junctions for applications in quantum\ninformation devices.\n", "  For testing gravity and detecting gravitational waves in space, deep-space\nlaser ranging using drag-free spacecraft is a common method. Deep space\nprovides a large arena and a long integration time. Laser technology provides\nmeasurement sensitivity, while drag-free technology ensures that gravitational\nphenomenon to be measured with least spurious noises. In this talk, we give an\noverview of motivations and methods of various space missions/proposals testing\nrelativistic gravity and detecting gravitational waves, and refer to various\nreferences.\n", "  Recent results from the H1 and ZEUS experiments are reported on electroweak\nphysics and on searches for new physics. All results are in good agreement with\nthe Standard Model.\n", "  We consider pair production and decay of fundamental unstable particles in\nthe framework of a modified perturbation theory treating resonant contributions\nin the sense of distributions. Outcomes of a numerical simulation up to the\nNNLO with taking into account universal massless-particles contributions are\npresented.\n", "  We improve results regarding the stability and attractivity of solutions $u$\nof a large class of initial-boundary-value problems characterized by a\nsemi-linear third order equation which may contain time-dependent coefficients.\nIn the proof we use Liapunov functionals $W$ depending on two parameters, which\nwe adapt to the 'error' $\\sigma$.\n", "  We consider a massless scalar field in 1+1 dimensions inside a cavity\ncomposed by a fixed plate, which imposes on the field a Robin BC, and an\noscillating one, which imposes on the field a Dirichlet BC. Assuming that the\nplate moves for a finite time interval, and considering parametric resonance,\nwe compute the total number of created particles inside the cavity. We\ngeneralize our results to the case of two parallel plates in 3+1 dimensions.\n", "  We study flavor oscillations of low energy neutrinos propagating in dense\nmatter of a rotating neutron star. On the basis of the exact solutions of the\nwave equations for neutrinos mass eigenstates we derive the transition\nprobability for neutrinos having big initial angular momentum. It is found that\nflavor oscillations of neutrinos with energies of several electron-Volts can be\nresonancely enhanced.\n", "  We present in this talk a recent investigation on a unified approach within\nthe framework of a hard-wall model of AdS/QCD. We first study a theoretical\ninconsistency in existing models. In order to remove this inconsistency, we\npropose a unified approach in which the mesons and the nucleons are treated on\nthe same footing, the same infrared (IR) cutoff being employed in both\nfermionic and bosonic sectors. We also suggest a possible way of improving the\nmodel by introducing a five-dimensional anomalous dimension.\n", "  A double-scattering reaction $\\pi^+ + d\\to p + p + \\eta$, where an $\\eta$\nmeson is rescattered, may provide new information on the $\\eta N\\to \\eta N$\nscattering. An idea to measure this reaction is proposed. Moreover,\nexperimental search for $\\eta$-mesic nuclei by the same $(\\pi, N)$ reaction is\ndiscussed.\n", "  This is a set of four lectures presented at the Theoretical Advanced Study\nInstitute (TASI-09) in June 2009. The goal of the lectures is to introduce\nstudents to some of the basic ideas and tools required for theoretical analysis\nof collider data. Several examples of Standard Model processes at\nelectron-positron and hadron colliders are considered to illustrate these\nideas. In addition, a general strategy for formulating searches for physics\nbeyond the Standard Model is outlined. The lectures conclude with a brief\nsurvey of recent, ongoing and future searches for the Higgs boson and\nsupersymmetric particles.\n", "  A cornerstone of special relativity is Lorentz Invariance, the postulate that\nall observers measure exactly the same photon speeds independently on the\nphoton energies. However, a hypothesized structure of spacetime may alter this\nconclusion at ultra-small length scales, a possibility allowed in many of the\nQuantum-Gravity (QG) formalisms currently investigated. A generalized\nuncertainty principle suggests that such effects might occur for photon\nenergies approaching the Planck energy, $E_{Planck}=M_{Planck} c^2 \\simeq\n1.22\\times10^{19} GeV$. Even though all photons yet detected have energies\n$E_{ph}<<E_{Planck}$, even a tiny variation in the speed of light, when\naccumulated over cosmological light-travel times, may be revealed by high\ntemporal-resolution measurements of sharp features in Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB)\nlightcurves. Here we report the results of a study using the emission from GRB\n090510 as detected by \\textit{Fermi}'s LAT and GBM instruments, that set\nunprecedented limits on the dependence of the speed of photons on their energy.\nWe find that the mass/energy scale for a linear in energy dispersion must be\nwell above the Planck scale, something that renders any affected QG models\nhighly implausible.\n", "  We analyse the Cauchy problem on a characteristic cone, including its vertex,\nfor the Einstein equations in arbitrary dimensions. We use a wave map gauge,\nsolve the obtained constraints and show gauge conservation.\n", "  Higgs boson production by the gluon fusion and its decay into two photons at\nthe LHC are investigated in the context of the gauge-Higgs unification\nscenario. The qualitative behaviors for these processes in the scenario are\nquite distinguishable from those of the Standard Model and the universal extra\ndimension scenario because of the overall sign difference for the effective\ncouplings induced by one-loop corrections through Kaluza-Klein modes.\n", "  Molecular motors drive mechanical motions utilizing the free energy liberated\nfrom chemical reactions such as ATP hydrolysis. Although it is essential to\nknow the efficiency of this free energy transduction, it has been a challenge\ndue to the system's microscopic scale. Here, we evaluate the single-molecule\nenergetics of a rotary molecular motor, F1-ATPase, by applying a recently\nderived nonequilibrium equality together with an electrorotation method. We\nshow that the sum of the heat flow through the probe's rotational degree of\nfreedom and the work against external load is almost equal to the free energy\nchange per a single ATP hydrolysis under various conditions. This implies that\nF1-ATPase works at an efficiency of nearly 100% in a thermally fluctuating\nenvironment.\n", "  We introduce a deconstructed model that incorporates both Higgsless and\ntop-color mechanisms. The model alleviates the typical tension in Higgsless\nmodels between obtaining the correct top quark mass and keeping delta-rho\nsmall. It does so by singling out the top quark mass generation as arising from\na Yukawa coupling to an effective top-Higgs which develops a small vacuum\nexpectation value, while electroweak symmetry breaking results largely from a\nHiggsless mechanism. As a result, the heavy partners of the SM fermions can be\nlight enough to be seen at the LHC.\n", "  We introduce middle convolution for systems of linear differential equations\nwith irregular singular points, and we presend a tentative definition of the\nindex of rigidity for them. Under some assumption, we show a list of terminal\npatterns of irreducible systems of linear differential equations by iterated\napplication of middle convolution when the index is positive or zero.\n", "  We discuss that the deviation of the Kugo-Ojima color confinement parameter\n$u(0)$ from -1 in the case of quenched lattice simulation and the consistency\nwith -1 in the case of full QCD simulation could be attributed to the boundary\ncondition defined by fermions inside the region of $r<1$fm. By using the domain\nwall fermion propagator in lattice simulation, we show that the chiral symmetry\nbreaking in the infrared can become manifest when one assumes that the\nleft-handed fermion on the left wall and the right-handed fermion on the right\nwall are correlated by a self-dual gauge field. The relation between the\ninfrared fixed point of the running coupling measured in lattice simulations,\nthe prediction of the BLM renormalization theory, the conformal field theory\nwith use of the t'Hooft anomaly matching condition in non-SUSY supersymmetric\ntheory and the quaternion real condition are discussed.\n", "  Strongly-interacting ultra-cold atoms in tight-binding optical lattice\npotentials provide an ideal platform to realize the fundamental Hubbard model.\nHere, after outlining the elementary single particle solution, we review and\nexpand our recent work on complete characterization of the bound and scattering\nstates of two and three bosonic atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice. In\nthe case of two atoms, there is a family of interaction-bound \"dimer\" states of\nco-localized particles that exists invariantly for either attractive or\nrepulsive on-site interaction, with the energy below or above the two-particle\nscattering continuum, respectively. Adding then the third particle -- \"monomer\"\n-- we find that, apart from the simple strongly-bound \"trimer\" corresponding to\nall three particles occupying the same lattice site, there are two peculiar\nfamilies of weakly-bound trimers with energies below and above the\nmonomer-dimer scattering continuum, the corresponding binding mechanism being\nan effective particle exchange interaction.\n", "  We demonstrate a sub-shot-noise-limit discrimination of on-off keyed coherent\nsignals by an optimal displacement quantum receiver in which a superconducting\ntransition edge sensor is installed. Use of a transition edge sensor and a\nfiber beam splitter realizes high total detection efficiency and high\ninterference visibility of the receiver and the observed average error\nsurpasses the shot-noise-limit in a wider range of the signal power. Our\ntechnique opens up a new technology for the sub-shot-noise-limit detection of\ncoherent signals in optical communication channels.\n", "  We analyze the constraints on the the vacuum polarization of the standard\nmodel gauge bosons from a minimal set of flavor observables valid for a general\nclass of models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. We will show that\nthe constraints have a strong impact on the self-coupling and masses of the\nlightest spin-one resonances.\n", "  The possibility of creation of cosmologically significant antimatter are\nanalyzed in different scenarios of baryogenesis. It is argued that there may\nexist plenty of antimatter even in our Galaxy. Possible forms of antimatter\nobjects and their observational signatures are discussed.\n", "  This is a pedagogical review on recent progress in the exact evaluation of\nphysical quantities in interacting quantum systems at finite temperatures. 1D\nquantum spin chains are discussed in detail as typical examples.\n", "  We describe a model for pion production off nucleons and coherent pions from\nnuclei induced by neutrinos in the 1 GeV energy regime. Besides the dominant\nDelta pole contribution, it takes into account the effect of background terms\nrequired by chiral symmetry. Moreover, the model uses a reduced\nnucleon-to-Delta resonance axial coupling, which leads to coherent pion\nproduction cross sections around a factor two smaller than most of the previous\ntheoretical estimates. Nuclear effects like medium corrections on the Delta\npropagator and final pion distortion are included.\n", "  We introduce a toy model implementing the proposal of using a custodial\nsymmetry to protect the Z b_L bbar_L coupling from large corrections. This\n\"doublet-extended standard model\" adds a weak doublet of fermions (including a\nheavy partner of the top quark) to the particle content of the standard model\nin order to implement an O(4) x U(1)_X = SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x P_LR x U(1)_X\nsymmetry in the top-quark mass generating sector. This symmetry is softly\nbroken to the gauged SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y electroweak symmetry by a Dirac mass M\nfor the new doublet; adjusting the value of M allows us to explore the range of\npossibilities between the O(4)-symmetric (M to 0) and standard-model-like (M to\ninfinity) limits.\n", "  The measurements of electrons from cosmic rays have begun a new era a few\nyears ago with high precision experiments like PAMELA and Fermi-LAT. The\npositron fraction seems to indicate an unknown component above the standard\nbackground described in the last 40 years, mostly by HEAT. In the last few\nyears, the PAMELA satellite has confirmed the positron fraction excess above 10\nGeV, and studying Fermi-LAT data, the electron flux seems to be steeper than\nexpected. While these new measurements have not closed the debate, results from\nAMS-02 are expected to reach the accuracy needed to determine a full\ndescription of this excess and possibly give some evidence on the possible\nsource. We will present in this note, the AMS-02 capacity in the case of\npositrons produced by pulsars.\n", "  We use photo-electrons as a non-contact probe to measure local electrical\npotentials in a solid-oxide electrochemical cell. We characterize the cell in\noperando at near-ambient pressure using spatially-resolved X-ray photoemission\nspectroscopy. The overpotentials at the interfaces between the Ni and Pt\nelectrodes and the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte are directly\nmeasured. The method is validated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.\nUsing the overpotentials, which characterize the cell's inefficiencies, we\ncompare without ambiguity the electro-catalytic efficiencies of Ni and Pt,\nfinding that on Ni H_2O splitting proceeds more rapidly than H2 oxidation,\nwhile on Pt, H2 oxidation proceeds more rapidly than H2O splitting.\n", "  We study the generalized ultradiscrete periodic Toda lattice T(M,N) which has\ntropical spectral curve. We introduce a tropical analogue of Fay's trisecant\nidentity, and apply it to construct a general solution to T(M,N).\n", "  We propose a dynamical model with a (2 + 1)-structure of composite Higgs\ndoublets: two nearly degenerate composites of the fourth family quarks t' and\nb', $\\Phi_{t^{\\prime}} \\sim \\bar{t^{\\prime}}_{R}(t^{\\prime},b^{\\prime})_L$ and\n$\\Phi_{b^{\\prime}} \\sim \\bar{b^{\\prime}}_{R}(t^{\\prime},b^{\\prime})_L$, and a\nheavier top-Higgs resonance $\\Phi_t \\sim \\bar{t}_{R}(t,b)_L$. This model\nnaturally describes both the top quark mass and the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. Also, a dynamical mechanism providing the quark mass hierarchy can be\nreflected in the model. The properties of these composites are analyzed in\ndetail.\n", "  Using Bloch-Nordsieck approximation fermion propagator in 3-dimensional gauge\ntheory with topological mass is studied. Infrared divergence of Chern-Simon\nterm is soft,which modifies anomalous dimension. In unquenched QCD with\n2-component spinor anomalous dimension has fractional value,where order\nparmeter is divergent.\n", "  QCD with 2 flavours of massless colour-sextet quarks is studied as a theory\nwhich might exhibit a range of scales over which the running coupling constant\nevolves very slowly (walks). We simulate lattice QCD with 2 flavours of sextet\nstaggered quarks to determine whether walks, or if it has an infrared fixed\npoint, making it a conformal field theory. Our initial simulations are\nperformed at finite temperatures $T=1/N_ta$ ($N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$), which allows\nus to identify the scales of confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking from the\ndeconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoring transitions. Unlike QCD with\nfundamental quarks, these two transitions appear to be well-separated. The\nchange in coupling constants at these transitions between the two different\ntemporal extents $N_t$, is consistent with these being finite temperature\ntransitions for an asymptotically free theory, which favours walking behaviour.\nIn the deconfined phase, the Wilson Line shows a 3-state signal. Between the\nconfinement and chiral transitions, there is an additional transition where the\nstates with Wilson Lines oriented in the directions of the complex cube roots\nof unity disorder into a state with a negative Wilson Line.\n", "  The spin light of neutrino is considered in the process of a neutrino\nradiative transition between two different mass states in presence of medium.\nBy this study we investigate the influence of background matter on the initial\nand final neutrino states in the process of massive Dirac neutrino decay due to\nthe non-zero transition magnetic moment. We derive corresponding corrections to\nthe total width of the process over the matter density in most important for\napplications cases.\n", "  We review developments made since 1959 in the search for a closed form for\nthe susceptibility of the Ising model. The expressions for the form factors in\nterms of the nome $q$ and the modulus $k$ are compared and contrasted. The\n$\\lambda$ generalized correlations $C(M,N;\\lambda)$ are defined and explicitly\ncomputed in terms of theta functions for $M=N=0,1$.\n", "  We develop a previously proposed gauge-invariant method to integrate out\ninfinite towers of vector and axialvector mesons arising as Kaluza-Klein (KK)\nmodes in a class of holographic models of QCD (HQCD). We demonstrate that HQCD\ncan be reduced to the chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) with the hidden local\nsymmetry (HLS) (so-called HLS-ChPT) having only the lowest KK mode identified\nas the HLS gauge boson, and the Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The ${\\cal O} (p^4)$\nterms in the HLS-ChPT are completely determined by integrating out infinite\ntowers of vector/axialvector mesons in HQCD: Effects of higher KK modes are\nfully included in the coefficients. As an example, we apply our method to the\nSakai-Sugimoto model.\n", "  A multi-fermion interaction model is investigated in a compact spacetime with\nnon-trivial topology and in a weakly curved spacetime. Evaluating the effective\npotential in the leading order of the 1/N expansion, we show the phase boundary\nfor a discrete chiral symmetry in an arbitrary dimensions, $2\\leq D<4$.\n", "  One of the key steps in recent work on the correlation functions of the XXZ\nchain was to regularize the underlying six-vertex model by a disorder parameter\n$\\alpha$. For the regularized model it was shown that all static correlation\nfunctions are polynomials in only two functions. It was further shown that\nthese two functions can be written as contour integrals involving the solutions\nof a certain type of linear and non-linear integral equations. The linear\nintegral equations depend parametrically on $\\alpha$ and generalize linear\nintegral equations known from the study of the bulk thermodynamic properties of\nthe model. In this note we consider the generalized dressed charge and a\ngeneralized magnetization density. We express the generalized dressed charge as\na linear combination of two quotients of $Q$-functions, the solutions of\nBaxter's $t$-$Q$-equation. With this result we give a new proof of a lemma on\nthe asymptotics of the generalized magnetization density as a function of the\nspectral parameter.\n", "  We discuss new approaches to compute numerically the Casimir interaction\nenergy for waveguides of arbitrary section, based on the boundary methods\ntraditionally used to compute eigenvalues of the 2D Helmholtz equation. These\nmethods are combined with the Cauchy's theorem in order to perform the sum over\nmodes. As an illustration, we describe a point-matching technique to compute\nthe vacuum energy for waveguides containing media with different\npermittivities. We present explicit numerical evaluations for perfect\nconducting surfaces in the case of concentric corrugated cylinders and a\ncircular cylinder inside an elliptic one.\n", "  We revisit the quantum/classical integrable model correspondence in the\ncontext of inhomogeneous finite length XXZ spin-1/2 chains with periodic\nboundary conditions and show that the Bethe scalar product of an arbitrary\nstate and a Bethe eigenstate is a discrete KP tau-function. The continuous Miwa\nvariables of discrete KP are the rapidities of the arbitrary state.\n", "  We present results of first principle calculations of the Casimir force\nbetween Si films of nanometric size, which show that it depends significantly\nupon the configuration of the surface atoms, and give evidence of the\nimportance of surface states.\n", "  Recent work of Foda and his group on a connection between classical\nintegrable hierarchies (the KP and 2D Toda hierarchies) and some quantum\nintegrable systems (the 6-vertex model with DWBC, the finite XXZ chain of spin\n1/2, the phase model on a finite chain, etc.) is reviewed. Some additional\ninformation on this issue is also presented.\n", "  The dimensionless entropy, ${\\cal S} \\equiv S/k$, of the visible universe,\ntaken as a sphere of radius 50 billion light years with the Earth at its\n\"center\", is discussed. An upper limit ($10^{112}$), and a lower limit\n($10^{102}$), for ${\\cal S}$ are introduced. It is suggested that\nintermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) constitute all dark matter, and that they\ndominate ${\\cal S}$.\n", "  We propose and analyze a new approach to generate a broadband astro-comb by\nspectral broadening of a narrowband astro-comb inside a highly nonlinear\noptical fiber. Numerical modeling shows that cascaded four-wave-mixing\ndramatically degrades the input comb's side-mode suppression and causes\nside-mode amplitude asymmetry. These two detrimental effects can systematically\nshift the center-of-gravity of astro-comb spectral lines as measured by an\nastrophysical spectrograph with resolution \\approx100,000; and thus lead to\nwavelength calibration inaccuracy and instability. Our simulations indicate\nthat this performance penalty, as a result of nonlinear spectral broadening,\ncan be compensated by using a filtering cavity configured for double-pass. As\nan explicit example, we present a design based on an Yb-fiber source comb (with\n1 GHz repetition rate) that is filtered by double-passing through a low finesse\ncavity (finesse = 208), and subsequent spectrally broadened in a 2-cm,\nSF6-glass photonic crystal fiber. Spanning more than 300 nm with 16 GHz line\nspacing, the resulting astro-comb is predicted to provide 1 cm/s (~10 kHz)\nradial velocity calibration accuracy for an astrophysical spectrograph. Such\nextreme performance will be necessary for the search for and characterization\nof Earth-like extra-solar planets, and in direct measurements of the change of\nthe rate of cosmological expansion.\n", "  Casimir energy is calculated for 5D scalar theory in the {\\it warped}\ngeometry. A new regularization, called {\\it sphere lattice regularization}, is\ntaken. The regularized configuration is {\\it closed-string like}. We\nnumerically evaluate $\\La$(4D UV-cutoff), $\\om$(5D bulk curvature, warp\nparameter) and $T$(extra space IR parameter) dependence of Casimir energy. 5D\nCasimir energy is {\\it finitely} obtained after the {\\it proper renormalization\nprocedure.} The {\\it warp parameter} $\\om$ suffers from the {\\it\nrenormalization effect}. We examine the cosmological constant problem.\n", "  Four is the maximum number of texture zeros allowed in the Yukawa coupling\nmatrix of three massive neutrinos. These completely fix the high scale CP\nviolation needed for leptogenesis in terms of that accessible at laboratory\nenergies. $\\mu\\tau$ symmetry drastically reduces such allowed textures. Only\none form of the light neutrinos mass matrix survives comfortably while another\nis marginally allowed.\n", "  I present recent calculations of the hadronic contributions to muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment in holographic QCD, based on gauge/gravity duality. The\nholographic estimates are compared well with the analysis based on recently\nrevised BaBar measurements of e+ e- -> pi+ pi- cross-sections and also with\nother model calculations for the light-by-light scattering contributions.\n", "  We propose a local scheme to enhance the security of quantum key distribution\nin Ekert protocol (E91). Our proposal is a fair sampling test meant to detect\nan eavesdropping attempt that would use a biased sample to mimic an apparent\nviolation of Bell inequalities. The test is local and non disruptive: it can be\nunilaterally performed at any time by either Alice or Bob during the production\nof the key, and together with the Bell inequality test.\n", "  From the principle of relativity with two universal invariant parameters $c$\nand $l$, 24 possible kinematical (including geometrical and static) algebras\ncan be obtained. Each algebra is of 10 dimensional, generating the symmetry of\na 4 dimensional homogeneous space-time or a pure space. In addition to the\nordinary Poincar\\'e algebra, there is another Poincar\\'e algebra among the 24\nalgebras. New 4d geometries with the new Poincar\\'e symmetry are presented. The\nmotion of free particles on one of the new space-times is discussed.\n", "  We study the relation between the periodic Benjamin-Ono equation with\ndiscrete Laplacian and the two dimensional Toda hierarchy. We introduce the\ntau-functions tau_pm(z) for the periodic Benjamin-Ono equation, construct two\nfamilies of integrals of motion {M_1,M_2,cdots},\n{overline{M}_1,overline{M}_2,cdots}, and calculate some examples of the\nbilinear equations using the Hamiltonian structure. We confirmed that some of\nthe low lying bilinear equations agree with the ones obtained from a certain\nreduction of the 2D Toda hierarchy.\n", "  This talk discusses the formation of primordial intermediate-mass black\nholes, in a double-inflationary theory, of sufficient abundance possibly to\nprovide all of the cosmological dark matter. There follows my, hopefully\nconvincing, explanation of the dark energy problem, based on the observation\nthat the visible universe is well approximated by a black hole. Finally, I\ndiscuss that Gell-Mann is among the five greatest theoreticians of the\ntwentieth century.\n", "  We discuss recent results on spectral properties of discrete alloy-type\nrandom Schr\\\"odinger operators. They concern Wegner estimates and bounds on the\nfractional moments of the Green's function.\n", "  Sensitivity of a neutrino factory to various mixing angles in a scheme with\none sterile neutrino is studied using $\\nu_e\\to\\nu_\\mu$, $\\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_\\mu$,\n$\\nu_e\\to\\nu_\\tau$ and $\\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_\\tau$. While the \"discovery-channel\"\n$\\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_\\tau$ is neither useful in the standard three flavor scheme nor\nvery powerful in the sensitivity study of sterile neutrino mixings, this\nchannel is important to check unitarity and to probe the new CP phase in the\nscheme beyond the standard neutrino mixing framework.\n", "  We consider a model of dark energy/matter unification based on a k-essence\ntype of theory similar to tachyon condensate models. Using an extension of the\ngeneral relativistic spherical model which incorporates the effects of both\npressure and the acoustic horizon we show that an initially perturbative\nk-essence fluid evolves into a mixed system containing cold dark matter like\ngravitational condensate in significant quantities.\n", "  We calculate the decay rate of the lightest heavy Majorana neutrino in a\nthermal bath using finite temperature cutting rules and effective Green's\nfunctions according to the hard thermal loop resummation technique. Compared to\nthe usual approach where thermal masses are inserted into the kinematics of\nfinal states, we find that deviations arise through two different leptonic\ndispersion relations. The decay rate differs from the usual approach by more\nthan one order of magnitude in the temperature range which is interesting for\nthe weak washout regime. This work summarizes the results of Ref. [1], to which\nwe refer the interested reader.\n", "  Even 100 years after the discovery of cosmic rays their origin remains a\nmystery. In recent years, TeV gamma-ray detectors have discovered and\ninvestigated many Galactic sources where particles are accelerated up to\nenergies of 100 TeV. However, it has not been possible up to now to identify\nthese sites unambiguously as sources of hadronic acceleration. The observation\nof cosmic high-energy neutrinos from these or other sources will be a\nsmoking-gun evidence for the sites of the acceleration of cosmic rays.\n", "  Since the 1970's, theories of deformation and failure of amorphous, solidlike\nmaterials have started with models in which stress-driven, molecular\nrearrangements occur at localized flow defects via \"shear transformations\".\nThis picture is the basis for the modern theory of \"shear transformation zones\"\n(STZ's), which is the focus of this review. We begin by describing the\nstructure of the theory in general terms and by showing several applications,\nspecifically: interpretation of stress-strain measurements for a bulk metallic\nglass, analysis of numerical simulations of shear banding, and the use of the\nSTZ equations of motion in free-boundary calculations. In the second half of\nthis article, we focus for simplicity on what we call an \"athermal\" model of\namorphous plasticity, and use that model to illustrate how the STZ theory\nemerges within a systematic formulation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.\n", "  The proton spin puzzle has challenged our understanding of QCD for the last\n20 years. We survey new developments in theory and experiment. The proton spin\npuzzle seems to be telling us about the interplay of valence quarks with chiral\ndynamics and the complex vacuum structure of QCD.\n", "  Planar N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory appears to be perturbatively\nintegrable. This work reviews integrability in terms of a Yangian algebra and\ncompares the application to the problems of anomalous dimensions and scattering\namplitudes.\n", "  The discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe using Type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe Ia) has stimulated a tremendous amount of interest in the use\nof SNe Type Ia events as standard cosmological candles, and as a probe of the\nfundamental physics of dark energy. Recent observations of SNe Ia have\nindicated a significant population difference depending on the host galaxy.\nThese observational findings are consistent with SNe Ia Ni-56 production in\nstar-forming spiral galaxies some 0.1 solar masses higher - and therefore more\nluminous than in elliptical galaxies. We present recent full-star, 3D\nsimulations of Type Ia supernovae which may help explain the nature of this\nsystematic variation in SNe Ia luminosities, as well as the nature of the Ia\nexplosion mechanism. These insights may in turn eventually shed light on the\nmystery of dark energy itself.\n", "  We discuss some fundamental properties of the XXZ spin chain, which are\nimportant in the algebraic Bethe-ansatz derivation for the multiple-integral\nrepresentations of the spin-s XXZ correlation function with an arbitrary\nproduct of elementary matrices. For instance, we construct Hermitian conjugate\nvectors in the massless regime and introduce the spin-s Hermitian elementary\nmatrices.\n", "  It is demonstrated that the strong power-like scaling violation in the\ntransverse momentum distribution of inclusive hadron production, observed by\nCDF Collaboration in $\\bar{p}p$ collisions at Tevatron is caused by\ncontribution of weak interaction. The contribution of weak interaction is\nincreasing with energy at high energies.\n", "  Several refinements are made in a theory which starts with a Planck-scale\nstatistical picture and ends with supersymmetry and a coupling of fundamental\nfermions and bosons to SO(N) gauge fields. In particular, more satisfactory\ntreatments are given for (1) the transformation from the initial Euclidean form\nof the path integral for fermionic fields to the usual Lorentzian form, (2) the\ncorresponding transformation for bosonic fields (which is much less\nstraightforward), (3) the transformation from an initial primitive\nsupersymmetry to the final standard form (containing, e.g., scalar sfermions\nand their auxiliary fields), (4) the initial statistical picture, and (5) the\ntransformation to an action which is invariant under general coordinate\ntransformations.\n", "  If the Einstein-Hilbert action ${\\cal L}_{\\rm EH}\\propto R$ is re-expressed\nin Riemann-Cartan spacetime using the gauge fields of translations, the\nvierbein field $h^\\alpha{}_\\mu$, and the gauge field of local Lorentz\ntransformations, the spin connection $A_{\\mu \\alpha}{}^ \\beta $, there exists a\nnew gauge symmetry which permits reshuffling the torsion, partially or totally,\ninto the Cartan curvature term of the Einstein tensor, and back, via a {\\em new\nmultivalued gauge transformation\\/}. Torsion can be chosen at will by an\narbitrary gauge fixing functional. There exist many equivalent ways of\nspecifing the theory, for instance Einstein's traditional way where ${\\cal\nL}_{\\rm EH}$ is expressed completely in terms of the metric $g_{\\mu \\nu}=h^\n\\alpha {}_\\mu h_ \\alpha {}_ \\nu $, and the torsion is zero, or Einstein's\nteleparallel formulation, where ${\\cal L}_{\\rm EH}$ is expressed in terms of\nthe torsion tensor, or an infinity of intermediate ways. As far as the\ngravitational field in the far-zone of a celestial object is concerned, matter\ncomposed of spinning particles can be replaced by matter with only orbital\nangular momentum, without changing the long-distance forces, no matter which of\nthe various new gauge representations is used.\n", "  We consider the finite temperature Casimir force acting on two parallel\nplates in a closed cylinder with the same cross section of arbitrary shape in\nthe presence of extra dimensions. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on\none plate and fractional Neumann conditions with order between zero (Dirichlet)\nand one (Neumann) are imposed on the other plate. Formulas for the Casimir\nforce show that it is always attractive for Dirichlet boundary conditions, and\nis always repulsive when the fractional order is larger than 1/2. For some\nfractional orders less than 1/2, the Casimir force can be either attractive or\nrepulsive depending on the size of the internal manifold and temperature.\n", "  The Approach unifying spin and charges, assuming that all the internal\ndegrees of freedom---the spin, all the charges and the families---originate in\n$d > (1+3)$ in only two kinds of spins (the Dirac one and the only one existing\nbeside the Dirac one and anticommuting with the Dirac one), is offering a new\nway in understanding the appearance of the families and the charges (in the\ncase of charges the similarity with the Kaluza-Klein-like theories must be\nemphasized). A simple starting action in $d >(1+3)$ for gauge fields (the\nvielbeins and the two kinds of the spin connections) and a spinor (which\ncarries only two kinds of spins and interacts with the corresponding gauge\nfields) manifests after particular breaks of the starting symmetry the massless\nfour (rather than three) families with the properties as assumed by the\nStandard model for the three known families, and the additional four massive\nfamilies. The lowest of these additional four families is stable. A part of the\nstarting action contributes, together with the vielbeins, in the break of the\nelectroweak symmetry manifesting in $d=(1+3)$ the Yukawa couplings (determining\nthe mixing matrices and the masses of the lower four families of fermions and\ninfluencing the properties of the higher four families) and the scalar field,\nwhich determines the masses of the gauge fields. The fourth family might be\nseen at the LHC, while the stable fifth family might be what is observed as the\ndark matter.\n", "  A number of ideas and questions related to the construction of quantum\nprocesses are discussed. Quantum state extension, entanglement and asymptotic\nbehaviour of the entropy are some of the issues explored. These topics are\nstudied in more detail for a class of quantum processes known as finitely\ncorrelated states. Several examples of such processes are presented,\nspecifically a Free Fermionic model.\n", "  We have performed a detailed analysis of the magnetic (collinear and\nnoncollinear) order and atomic and the electron structures of UO2, PuO2 and UN\non the basis of density functional theory with the Hubbard electron correlation\ncorrection (DFT+U). We have shown that the 3-k magnetic structure of UO2 is the\nlowest in energy for the Hubbard parameter value of U=4.6 eV (and J=0.5 eV)\nconsistent with experiments when Dudarev's formalism is used. In contrast to\nUO2, UN and PuO2 show no trend for a distortion towards rhombohedral structure\nand, thus, no complex 3-k magnetic structure is to be anticipated in these\nmaterials.\n", "  We review the progress in the holographic calculation of shear viscosity for\nstrongly coupled field theories. We focus on the calculation of shear viscosity\nfrom the effective coupling of transverse gravitons and present some explicit\nexamples.\n", "  Superconducting terahertz (THz) metamaterial (MM) made from superconducting\nNb film has been investigated using a continuous-wave THz spectroscopy with a\nsuperconducting split-coil magnet. The obtained quality factors of the resonant\nmodes at 132 GHz and 450 GHz are about three times as large as those calculated\nfor a metal THz MM operating at 1 K, which indicates that superconducting THz\nMM is a very nice candidate to achieve low loss performance. In addition, the\nmagnetic field-tuning on superconducting THz MM is also demonstrated, which\noffer an alternative tuning method apart from the existed electric, optical and\nthermal tuning on THz MM.\n", "  Much of modern string theory research concerns AdS/CFT duality, or more\ngenerally, gauge/gravity duality. The main subjects are a) Testing and\nunderstanding such dualities by exploring how they work for systems with a lot\nof supersymmetry b) Constructing and exploring approximate string theory duals\nof QCD c) Applying gauge/gravity duality to other areas of physics such as\ncondensed matter and nuclear physics. I will briefly discuss the first topic.\n", "  A simple collision model is employed to introduce elementary concepts of open\nsystem dynamics of quantum systems. In particular, within the framework of\ncollision models we introduce the quantum analogue of thermalization process\ncalled quantum homogenization and simulate quantum decoherence processes. These\ndynamics are driven by partial swaps and controlled unitary collisions,\nrespectively. We show that collision models can be used to prepare multipartite\nentangled states. Partial swap dynamics generates W-type of entanglement\nsaturating the CKW inequalities, whereas the decoherence collision models\ncreates GHZ-type of entangled states. The considered evolution of a system in a\nsequence of collisions is described by a discrete semigroup E_1,...,E_n.\nInterpolating this discrete points within the set of quantum channels we derive\nfor both processes the corresponding Lindblad master equations. In particular,\nwe argue that collision models can be used as simulators of arbitrary Markovian\ndynamics, however, the inverse is not true.\n", "  We give a direct derivation of a proposal of Nekrasov-Shatashvili concerning\nthe quantization conditions of the Toda chain. The quantization conditions are\nformulated in terms of solutions to a nonlinear integral equation similar to\nthe ones coming from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. This is equivalent to\nextremizing a certain function called Yang's potential. It is shown that the\nNekrasov-Shatashvili formulation of the quantization conditions follows from\nthe solution theory of the Baxter equation, suggesting that this way of\nformulating the quantization conditions should indeed be applicable to large\nclasses of quantized algebraically integrable models.\n", "  Networks are a natural and popular mechanism for the representation and\ninvestigation of a broad class of systems. But extracting information from a\nnetwork can present significant challenges. We present NetzCope, a software\napplication for the display and analysis of networks. Its key features include\nthe visualization of networks in two or three dimensions, the organization of\nvertices to reveal structural similarity, and the detection and visualization\nof network communities by modularity maximization.\n", "  We overview the status of the studies on neutrino oscillations with\naccelerators at the present running experiments. Past and present results\nenlighten the path towards the observation of massive neutrinos and the\nsettling of their oscillations. The very near future may still have addiction\nfrom the outcome of the on-going experiments. OPERA is chosen as a relevant\nexample justified by the very recent results released.\n", "  The separation of micron-sized bacterial spores (Bacillus cereus) from a\nsteady flow of water through the use of ultrasonic standing waves is\ndemonstrated. An ultrasonic resonator with cross-section of 0.0254 m x 0.0254 m\nhas been designed with a flow inlet and outlet for a water stream that ensures\nlaminar flow conditions into and out of the resonator section of the flow tube.\nA 0.01905-m diameter PZT-4, nominal 2-MHz transducer is used to generate\nultrasonic standing waves in the resonator. The acoustic resonator is 0.0356 m\nfrom transducer face to the opposite reflector wall with the acoustic field in\na direction orthogonal to the water flow direction. At fixed frequency\nexcitation, spores are concentrated at the stable locations of the acoustic\nradiation force and trapped in the resonator region. The effect of the\ntransducer voltage and frequency on the efficiency of spore capture in the\nresonator has been investigated. Successful separation of B. cereus spores from\nwater with typical volume flow rates of 40-250 ml/min has been achieved with\n15% efficiency in a single pass at 40 ml/min.\n", "  Two types of arguments concerning (im)possibility of constructing a scalable,\nexponentially stable quantum memory equipped with Hamiltonian controls are\ndiscussed. The first type concerns ergodic properties of open Kitaev models\nwhich are considered as promising candidates for such memories. It is shown\nthat, although the 4D Kitaev model provides stable qubit observables, the\nHamiltonian control is not possible. The thermodynamical approach leads to the\nnew proposal of the revised version of Landauer's principle and suggests that\nthe existence of quantum memory implies the existence of the perpetuum mobile\nof the second kind. Finally, a discussion of the stability property of\ninformation and its implications is presented.\n", "  We study the structure of the sigma meson, the lowest-lying resonance of the\npi pi scattering in the scalar-isoscalar channel, through the softening\nphenomena associated with the partial restoration of chiral symmetry. We build\ndynamical chiral models to describe the pi pi scattering amplitude, in which\nthe sigma meson is described either as the chiral partner of the pion or as the\ndynamically generated resonance through the pi pi attraction. It is shown that\nthe internal structure is reflected in the softening phenomena; the softening\npattern of the dynamically generated sigma meson is qualitatively different\nfrom the behavior of the chiral partner of the pion. On the other hand, in the\nsymmetry restoration limit, the dynamically generated sigma meson behaves\nsimilarly to the chiral partner.\n", "  A nonlinear interferometry scheme is described theoretically to induce and\nresolve electron wave- function beating on time scales shorter than the optical\ncycle of the time-delayed pump and probe pulses. By employing two moderately\nintense few-cycle laser fields with a stable carrier-envelope phase, a large\nrange of the entire electronic level structure of a quantum system can be\nretrieved. In contrast to single-photon excitation schemes, the retrieved\nelectronic states include levels that are both dipole- and\nnon-dipole-accessible from the ground electronic state. The results show that\nstrong-field interferometry can reveal both high-resolution and broad-band\nspectral information at the same time with important consequences for\nquantum-beat spectroscopy on attosecond or even shorter time scales.\n", "  We demonstrate that the chiral-odd transversity generalized parton\ndistributions (GPDs) of the nucleon can be accessed through the exclusive\nphotoproduction process gamma + N -> pi + rho + N', in the kinematics where the\nmeson pair has a large invariant mass and the final nucleon has a small\ntransverse momentum, provided the vector meson is produced in a transversely\npolarized state. We calculate perturbatively the scattering amplitude at\nleading order in alpha_s: We build a simple model for the dominant transversity\nGPD HT (x; chi; t) based on the concept of double distribution. Counting rates\nestimates show that the experiment looks feasible with the real photon beam\ncharacteristics expected at JLab@12 GeV, in low Q2 leptoproduction at Jlab@12\nGeV and in the COMPASS experiment.\n", "  In this talk it is reported on an analysis of hard exclusive pion\nelectroproduction within the handbag approach. Particular emphasis is laid on\nsingle-spin asymmetries. It is argued that a recent HERMES measurement of\nasymmetries measured with a transversely polarized target clearly indicate the\noccurrence of strong contributions from transversely polarized photons. Within\nthe handbag approach such gamma_T --> pion transitions are described by the\ntransversity GPDs accompanied by a twist-3 pion wave function. It is shown that\nthis approach leads to results on cross sections and single-spin asymmetries in\nfair agreement with experiment.\n", "  Recent reports of periodic fluctuations in nuclear decay data of certain\nisotopes have led to the suggestion that nuclear decay rates are being\ninfluenced by the Sun, perhaps via neutrinos. Here we present evidence for the\nexistence of an additional periodicity that appears to be related to the Rieger\nperiodicity well known in solar physics.\n", "  This snapshot of recent progress in hadron physics made in connection with\nQCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations includes: a perspective on confinement and\ndynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB); a pre'cis on the physics of\nin-hadron condensates; results on the hadron spectrum, including\ndressed-quark-core masses for the nucleon and Delta, their first radial\nexcitations, and the parity-partners of these states; an illustration of the\nimpact of DCSB on the electromagnetic pion form factor, thereby exemplifying\nhow data can be used to chart the momentum-dependence of the dressed-quark mass\nfunction; and a prediction that F_1^{p,d}/F_1^{p,u} passes through zero at\nQ^2\\approx 5m_N^2 owing to the presence of nonpointlike scalar and axial-vector\ndiquark correlations in the nucleon.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments with confined binary liquid mixtures near\ntheir continous demixing phase transition we study the critical behavior of a\nsystem, which belongs to the Ising universality class, for the film geometry\nwith one planar wall chemically structured such that there is a laterally\nalternating adsorption preference for the species of the binary liquid mixture.\nBy means of Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis we\ndetermine the critical Casimir force and the corresponding universal scaling\nfunction.\n", "  Positronium, the electron-positron bound state, is described to a good\napproximation by pure QED. The states of positronium have definite values of C\nand P. Consequently, positronium is an attractive system for the investigation\nof possible violations of the discrete symmetries in the leptonic sector. We\ndiscuss signals for CP and CPT violation in the decay of spin-polarized\northopositronium and show where such correlations might arise in the context of\nthe Standard-Model Extension.\n", "  We motivate the concept of emergent gauge symmetry and discuss ways that this\nconcept can be tested. The key idea is that if a symmetry is emergent, one\nshould look for small violations of this symmetry because the underlying\nfundamental theory does not contain the symmetry. We describe our recent work\nimplementing this idea in the gravity sector. We also describe the reasons why\nviolations of gauge symmetry may well be linked to violations of Lorentz\ninvariance.\n", "  The covariantly constant spacetime torsion is one of the fields which may\nbreak Lorentz and CPT symmetry. We review the previous works on the dynamical\ntorsion in the framework of effective quantum field theory (QFT). It turns out\nthat the existence of propagating torsion is strongly restricted by the QFT\nprinciples. In particular, the torsion mass must be much greater than the\nmasses of all fermionic particles. In this situation, the main chance to\nobserve torsion is due to some symmetry breaking which may, in principle,\nproduce almost constant background torsion field.\n", "  The AdS/CFT correspondence between theories in AdS space and conformal field\ntheories in physical space-time provides an analytic, semi-classical,\ncolor-confining model for strongly-coupled QCD. The soft-wall AdS/QCD model\nmodified by a positive-sign dilaton metric leads to a remarkable one-parameter\ndescription of nonperturbative hadron dynamics at zero quark mass, including a\nzero-mass pion and a Regge spectrum of linear trajectories with the same slope\nin orbital angular momentum $L$ and radial quantum number $n$ for both mesons\nand baryons. One also predicts the form of the non-perturbative effective\ncoupling $\\alpha_s^{AdS}(Q)$ and its $\\beta$-function which agrees with the\neffective coupling $\\alpha_{g_1}$ extracted from the Bjorken sum rule.\nLight-front holography, which connects the fifth-dimensional coordinate of AdS\nspace $z$ to an invariant impact separation variable $\\zeta$, allows one to\ncompute the analytic form of the frame-independent light-front wavefunctions,\nthe fundamental entities which encode hadron properties as well as decay\nconstants, form factors, deeply virtual Compton scattering, exclusive heavy\nhadron decays and other exclusive scattering amplitudes. One thus obtains a\nrelativistic description of hadrons in QCD at the amplitude level with\ndimensional counting for hard exclusive reactions at high momentum transfer. As\nspecific examples we discuss the behavior of the pion and nucleon form factors\nin the space-like and time-like regions. We also review the phenomenology of\nexclusive processes including some anomalous empirical results.\n", "  We perform numerical simulations of a simple model of one-patch colloidal\nparticles to investigate: (i) the behavior of the gas-liquid phase diagram on\nmoving from a spherical attractive potential to a Janus potential and (ii) the\ncollective structure of a system of Janus particles. We show that, for the case\nwhere one of the two hemispheres is attractive and one is repulsive, the system\norganizes into a dispersion of orientational ordered micelles and vesicles and,\nat low $T$, the system can be approximated as a fluid of such clusters,\ninteracting essentially via excluded volume. The stability of this cluster\nphase generates a very peculiar shape of the gas and liquid coexisting\ndensities, with a gas coexistence density which increases on cooling,\napproaching the liquid coexistence density at very low $T$.\n", "  A quantum field model for Dirac-like tachyons respecting a frame-dependent\ninterpretation rule, and thus inherently breaking Lorentz invariance, is\ndefined. It is shown how the usual paradoxa ascribed to tachyons, instability\nand acausality, are resolved in this model, and it is argued elsewhere that\nLorentz symmetry breaking is necessary to permit perturbative renormalizability\nand causality. Elimination of negative-normed states results in only\nleft-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles, suitable for describing\nthe neutrino. In this context the neutron beta decay spectrum is calculated\nnear the end point for large, but not ultrarelativistic preferred frame speed,\nassuming a vector weak interaction vertex.\n", "  We review some of the basic features and predictions of a gauge invariant\nspontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking model arising from the nonzero vacuum\nexpectation value of the electromagnetic tensor and leading to a nonlinear\nelectrodynamics. The model is stable in the small Lorentz invariance violation\napproximation. The speed of light is independent of the frequency and one of\nthe propagating modes is highly anisotropic. The bound (Delta c)/c < 10^{-32}\nis obtained for such anisotropy measured in perpendicular directions.\n", "  We discuss vacuum condensates associated with emergent QED and with torsion,\nas well as the possible role of the Kodama wave function in quantum cosmology.\n", "  A new model for neutrino oscillations is introduced, in which mass-like\nbehavior is seen at high energies, but various behavior can be predicted at low\nenergies. The model employs no neutrino masses, but instead relies on the\nLorentz-violating parameters a and c. Oscillations into antineutrinos and\nsterile neutrinos are also considered.\n", "  The Standard-Model Extension (SME) is an action-based expansion describing\ngeneral Lorentz violation for known matter and fields, including gravity. In\nthis talk, I will discuss the Lorentz-violating gravity couplings in the SME.\nToy models that match the SME expansion, including vector and two-tensor\nmodels, are reviewed. Finally I discuss the status of experiments and\nobservations probing gravity coefficients for Lorentz violation.\n", "  At the TeV scale, heavy quarks, for example the 4th generation quarks of the\nStandard Model with four generations, can form condensates which dynamically\nbreak the electroweak symmetry. A dense quark system may form other types of\ncondensates which dynamically break the Lorentz symmetry. These condensates are\ndescribed by a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type effective action, similar to the quark\ncondensation models in hadronic matter with finite density. The vacua\ncorresponding to these two types of condensates compete for the global minimum\nof the effective potential, depending on the energy scale and the related\nstrong dynamics. The resultant Goldstone gauge boson may produce observable\neffects in relativistic heavy-ion colliders.\n", "  A constituent quark model based on the spectator formalism is applied to the\ngamma N -> N* transition for the three cases, where N* is the nucleon, the\nDelta and the Roper resonance. The model is covariant, and therefore can be\nused for the predictions at higher four-momentum transfer squared, Q2. The\nbaryons are described as an off-mass-shell quark and a spectator on-mass-shell\ndiquark systems. The quark electromagnetic current is described by quark form\nfactors, which have a form inspired by the vector meson dominance. The valence\nquark contributions of the model are calibrated by lattice QCD simulations and\nexperimental data. Contributions of the meson cloud to the inelastic processes\nare explicitly included.\n", "  Neutrino oscillations in the presence of Lorentz violation can present novel\nobservable signals in both long- and short-baseline experiments. In this talk\nwe describe the theory and its different regimes depending on properties of the\nexperiments. CPT violation, its systematic search and possible connections to\nlatest results are also presented.\n", "  To test Lorentz symmetry we used a 3He/129Xe co-magnetometer. We will give a\nshort summary of our experimental setup and the results of our latest\nmeasurements. We obtained preliminary results for the equatorial component of\nthe background field interacting with the spin of the bound neutron: b_n < 3.72\nx 10^(-32) GeV (95 C.L.).\n", "  We consider the nondynamical Chern-Simons (CS) modification to General\nRelativity (GR) in the framework of the Einstein-Cartan formulation, as\nproviding a way to incorporate a slowly rotating Kerr black hole in the space\nof solutions. Our proposal lies on considering the CS term as a source of\ntorsion and on an iterative procedure to look for vacuum solutions of the\nsystem, by expanding the tetrad, the connection and the embedding parameter, in\npowers of a dimensionless small parameter $\\beta$ which codifies the CS\ncoupling. Starting from a torsionless zeroth-order vacuum solution we derive\nthe second-order differential equation for the $\\mathcal{O}(\\beta)$ corrections\nto the metric, for an arbitrary embedding parameter. Furthermore we can show\nthat the slowly rotating Kerr metric is an $\\mathcal{O}(\\beta)$ solution of the\nsystem either in the canonical or the axial embeddings.\n", "  For most theories which parametrize modifications of General Relativity,\nincluding those which violate the equivalence principle, gravitational redshift\ntests typically offer weaker constraints on such test parameters than do\nprecision measurements of the universality of free fall (UFF) and local Lorentz\ninvariance (LLI). Although redshift anomalies are often linked with violations\nof UFF or LLI, they do not have to be. We offer a simple model in which\nparticle masses anomalously vary with the gravitational potential. This\ngenerates gravitational redshift anomalies unconstrained by existing tests of\nUFF or LLI. We propose new experiments to limit such effects.\n", "  A recent measurement of the gravitational redshift was based on interference\nof matter waves. Operation in microgravity can improve it by a factor of $10^5$\nand, in some models, even $10^{10}$.\n", "  We discuss the state-of-the-art of the theory of transverse-momentum\ndependent parton densities (TMD)s, paying special attention to their\nrenormalization properties, the structure of the gauge links in the operator\ndefinition, and the role of the soft factor in the factorization formula within\nthe TMD approach to the semi-inclusive processes. We argue that the use of the\nlightcone axial gauge offers certain advantages for a consistent definition of\nTMDs as compared to the off-the-light-cone gauges, or covariant gauges with\noff-the-lightcone gauge links.\n", "  SR-POEM, our principle of equivalence measurement on a sounding rocket, will\ncompare the free fall rate of two substances yielding an uncertainty of E-16 in\nthe estimate of \\eta. During the past two years, the design concept has matured\nand we have been working on the required technology, including a laser gauge\nthat is self aligning and able to reach 0.1 pm per root hertz for periods up to\n40 s. We describe the status and plans for this project.\n", "  The immediate observational consequence of a non-trivial spatial topology of\nthe Universe is that an observer could potentially detect multiple images of\nradiating sources. In particular, a non-trivial topology will generate pairs of\ncorrelated circles of temperature fluctuations in the anisotropies maps of the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB), the so-called circles-in-the-sky. In this\nway, a detectable non-trivial spatial topology may be seen as an observable\nattribute, which can be probed through the circles-in-the-sky for all locally\nhomogeneous and isotropic universes with no assumptions on the cosmological\ndark energy (DE) equation of state (EOS) parameters. We show that the knowledge\nof the spatial topology through the circles-in-the-sky offers an effective way\nof reducing the degeneracies in the DE EOS parameters. We concretely illustrate\nthe topological role by assuming, as an exanple, a Poincar\\'{e} dodecahedral\nspace topology and reanalyzing the constraints on the parameters of a specific\nEOS which arise from the supernovae type Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations and\nthe CMB plus the statistical topological contribution.\n", "  The MiniBooNE experiment is a $\\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_\\mu\\to\\bar\\nu_e$\nappearance neutrino oscillation experiment at Fermilab. The neutrino mode\noscillation analysis shows an excess of $\\nu_e$ candidate events in the\nlow-energy region. These events are analyzed under the SME formalism, utilizing\nthe short baseline approximation. The preliminary result shows the time\nindependent solution is favored. The relationship with the SME parameters\nextracted from the LSND experiment is discussed. The systematic error analysis\nand antineutrino mode analysis are outlined.\n", "  We review quark model calculations of the transverse momentum dependent\nparton distributions (TMDs). For the T-even TMDs, we discuss the physical\norigin of model relations which hold in a large class of quark models. For the\nT-odd TMDs we review results in a light-cone constituent quark model (CQM) with\nthe final state interaction effects generated via single-gluon exchange\nmechanism. As phenomenological application, we show the good agreement between\nresults in the light-cone CQM and available experimental data for the Collins\nasymmetry.\n", "  We discuss the recent interpretation of quark distribution functions in the\nplane transverse to the light-cone direction. Such a mapping is model\nindependent and allows one to build multidimensional pictures of the hadron and\nto develop a semi-classical intuition of the quark dynamics. We comment briefly\nthe results obtained from the Form Factors of the nucleon. A generalization to\na target with arbitrary spin led to a set of preferred values for the\nelectromagnetic coupling characterizing structureless particles. Generalized\npolarizabilities can also be interpreted in that frame as the distortion of the\ncharge densities due to an external electromagnetic field. Finally, we present\npreliminary results for the Generalized Transverse-Momentum dependent\nDistributions which encode in principle the most complete information about\nquark distributions.\n", "  We present a Michelson-Morley type experiment for testing the isotropy of the\nspeed of light in vacuum and matter. The experiment compares the resonance\nfrequency of a monolithic optical sapphire resonator with the resonance\nfrequency of an orthogonal evacuated optical cavity made of fused silica while\nthe whole setup is rotated on an air bearing turntable once every 45 s.\nPreliminary results yield an upper limit for the anisotropy of the speed of\nlight in matter (sapphire) of \\Delta c/c < 4x10^(-15), limited by the frequency\nstability of the sapphire resonator operated at room temperature. Work to\nincrease the measurement sensitivity by more than one order of magnitude by\ncooling down the sapphire resonator to liquid helium temperatures (LHe) is\ncurrently under way.\n", "  We construct a collection of Lorentz violating Yang-Mills theories exhibiting\nsupersymmetry.\n", "  The Dirac equation with Lorentz violation involves additional coefficients\nand yields a fourth-order polynomial that must be solved to yield the\ndispersion relation. The conventional method of taking the determinant of\n$4\\times 4$ matrices of complex numbers often yields unwieldy dispersion\nrelations. By using quaternions, the Dirac equation may be reduced to $2 \\times\n2$ form in which the structure of the dispersion relations become more\ntransparent. In particular, it is found that there are two subsets of\nLorentz-violating parameter sets for which the dispersion relation is easily\nsolvable. Each subset contains half of the parameter space so that all\nparameters are included.\n", "  We study some consequences of the introduction of a Lorentz-violating\nmodification term in the linearized gravity, which leads to modified dispersion\nrelations for gravitational waves in the vacuum. We also discuss possible\nmechanisms for the induction of such a term in the Lagrangian.\n", "  In any theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking, it is important to account\nfor the massless Nambu-Goldstone and massive Higgs modes. In this short review,\nthe fate of these modes is examined for the case of a bumblebee model, in which\nLorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken.\n", "  Gauge field theory of a horizontal symmetry of the group G = SU(2) X U(1) is\ndeveloped so as to generalize the standard model of particle physics. All\nfermion and scalar fields are assumed to belong to doublets and singlets of the\ngroup in high energy regime. Mass matrices with four texture zeros of Dirac and\nMajorana types are systematically derived. In addition to seven scalar\nparticles, the theory predicts existence of one peculiar vector particle which\nseems to play important roles in astrophysics and particle physics.\n", "  It is known how to access information on quark orbital angular momentum from\ngeneralized parton distribution functions, in a certain specified framework. It\nis intuitively expected, that such information can be accessed also through\ntransverse momentum dependent distribution functions, but not known how. Now\nquark models provide promising hints. Recent results are reviewed.\n", "  The subject of this paper is a mathematical transition from the Fisher\ninformation of classical statistics to the matrix formalism of quantum theory.\nIf the monotonicity is the main requirement, then there are several quantum\nversions parametrized by a function. In physical applications the minimal is\nthe most popular. There is a one-to-one correspondence between Fisher\ninformations (called also monotone metrics) and abstract covariances. The skew\ninformation and the chi-square-divergence are treated here as particular cases.\n", "  We discuss the complexity of GPD phenomenology, comment on the technological\nneeds for a global analysis, and report on model and neural network fits to the\nphoton electroproduction off unpolarized proton. We also point out that\nRadyushkin's double distribution ansatz is a `holographic' GPD model.\n", "  Large angle photodisintegration of two nucleons from the 3He nucleus is\nstudied within the framework of the hard rescattering model (HRM). In the HRM\nthe incoming photon is absorbed by one nucleon's valence quark that then\nundergoes a hard rescattering reaction with a valence quark from the second\nnucleon producing two nucleons emerging at large transverse momentum .\nParameter free cross sections for pp and pn break up channels are calculated\nthrough the input of experimental cross sections on pp and pn elastic\nscattering. The calculated cross section for pp breakup and its predicted\nenergy dependency are in good agreement with recent experimental data.\nPredictions on spectator momentum distributions and helicity transfer are also\npresented.\n", "  The Standard-Model Extension (SME) provides a theoretical framework for tests\nof Lorentz invariance. To date, most studies have focused on the minimal SME,\nwhich restricts attention to operators of renormalizable dimension. Here, we\nreview recent studies involving the nonrenormalizable photon sector of the SME.\n", "  We discuss the relevance of studying single transverse-spin asymmetry in\nhard-exclusive meson electroproduction in the backward region. Such an\nasymmetry could help us discriminate between contributions from a soft baryon\nexchange in the u-channel and a hard parton-induced scattering.\n", "  An experimental test of the Newtonian inverse square law at short range has\nbeen used to set limits on Lorentz violation in the pure gravity sector of the\nStandard-Model Extension. On account of the planar test mass geometry,\nnominally null with respect to inverse square forces, the limits derived for\nthe SME coefficients of Lorentz violation are on the order s ~ 10000.\n", "  The perturbative treatment of high-energy fixed-angle hadron-hadron exclusive\nscattering is reviewed and related to the transverse structure of the proton\nand other hadrons.\n", "  We present a new method to extract parton distribution functions from high\nenergy experimental data based on a specific type of neural networks, the\nSelf-Organizing Maps. We illustrate the features of our new procedure that are\nparticularly useful for an anaysis directed at extracting generalized parton\ndistributions from data. We show quantitative results of our initial analysis\nof the parton distribution functions from inclusive deep inelastic scattering.\n", "  We propose a toy model of baryogenesis which applies the `ratchet mechanism,'\nused frequently in the theory of biological molecular motors, to a model\nproposed by Dimopoulos and Susskind.\n", "  The effects of nonperturbatively generated ``quark sea'' have been\ninvestigated to determine the flavor structure of the octet baryons. The chiral\nconstituent quark model ($\\chi$CQM), which is known to provide a satisfactory\nexplanation of the proton spin and related issues in the nonperturbative\nregime, is able to explain the qualitative generation of the requisite amount\nof quark sea. The importance of quark sea has been studied at different values\nof the Bjorken scaling variable $x$ by including it phenomenologically in the\nsea quark distribution functions. The results for the quark sea asymmetries\nlike $\\bar d(x)-\\bar u(x)$, $\\bar d(x)/\\bar u(x)$ and Gottfried integral for\nthe octet baryons strengthen the significance of quark sea at lower values of\n$x$.\n", "  We present a novel laser mode-locking scheme and discuss its unusual\nproperties and feasibility using a theoretical model. A large set of\nsingle-frequency continuous-wave lasers oscillate by amplification in spatially\nseparated gain media. They are mutually phase-locked by nonlinear feedback from\na common saturable absorber. As a result, ultra short pulses are generated. The\nnew scheme offers three significant benefits: the light that is amplified in\neach medium is continuous wave, thereby avoiding issues related to group\nvelocity dispersion and nonlinear effects that can perturb the pulse shape. The\nset of frequencies on which the laser oscillates, and therefore the pulse\nrepetition rate, is controlled by the geometry of resonator-internal optical\nelements, not by the cavity length. Finally, the bandwidth of the laser can be\ncontrolled by switching gain modules on and off. This scheme offers a route to\nmode-locked lasers with high average output power, repetition rates that can be\nscaled into the THz range, and a bandwidth that can be dynamically controlled.\nThe approach is particularly suited for implementation using semiconductor\ndiode laser arrays.\n", "  Measurements of transition form factors for the electro-excitation of nucleon\nresonances in the Q^2=5-14 GeV^2 region can provide one with the information on\nquark wave functions at small transverse separations. In particular a\ncomparison of form factors for the states of opposite parity can give insight\nin the mechanisms of chiral symmetry breaking. I discuss perspectives of the\ntheoretical description of such reactions using a combination of lattice\ncalculations and light-cone sum rules\n", "  Following the simple proposal by He and Ma for quantization of a black\nhole(BH) by Bohr's idea about the atoms, we discussed the solvability of the\nwave equation for such a BH. We superficial solved the associated Schrodinger\nequation. The eigenfunction problem reduces to HeunB $H$ differential equation\nwhich is a natural generalization of the hypergeometric differential equation.\nIn other words, the spectrum can be determined by solving the Heun's\ndifferential equation.\n", "  We report recent progress toward on-chip single photon emission and detection\nin the near infrared utilizing semiconductor nanowires. Our single photon\nemitter is based on a single InAsP quantum dot embedded in a p-n junction\ndefined along the growth axis of an InP nanowire. Under forward bias, light is\nemitted from the single quantum dot by electrical injection of electrons and\nholes. The optical quality of the quantum dot emission is shown to improve when\nsurrounding the dot material by a small intrinsic section of InP. Finally, we\nreport large multiplication factors in excess of 1000 from a single Si nanowire\navalanche photodiode comprised of p-doped, intrinsic, and n-doped sections. The\nlarge multiplication factor obtained from a single Si nanowire opens up the\npossibility to detect a single photon at the nanoscale.\n", "  Exclusive meson leptoproduction from nucleons in the deeply virtual exchanged\nboson limit can be described by generalized parton distributions (GPDs).\nIncluding spin dependence in the description requires 8 independent\nquark-parton and gluon-parton functions. The chiral even subset of 4\nquark-nucleon GPDs are related to nucleon form factors and to parton\ndistribution functions. The chiral odd set of 4 quark-nucleon GPDs are related\nto transversity, the tensor charge, and other quantities related to\ntransversity. Different meson or photon production processes access different\ncombinations of GPDs. This is analyzed in terms of $t$-channel exchange quantum\nnumbers, $J^{PC}$ and it is shown that pseudoscalar production can isolate\nchiral odd GPDs. There is a sensitive dependence in various cross sections and\nasymmetries on the tensor charge of the nucleon and other transversity\nparameters. In a second section, analyticity and completeness are shown to\nlimit the partonic interpretation of the GPDs in the ERBL region.\n", "  The first-principles electronic structure calculations made substantial\ncontribution to study of high $T_c$ iron-pnictide superconductors. By the\ncalculations, LaFeAsO was first predicted to be an antiferromagnetic semimetal,\nand the novel bi-collinear antiferromagnetic order was predicted for\n$\\alpha$-FeTe. Moreover, based on the calculations the underlying mechanism was\nproposed to be Arsenic-bridged antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction\nbetween the next-nearest neighbor Fe moments. In this article, this physical\npicture is further presented and discussed in association with the elaborate\nfirst-principles calculations on LaFePO. The further discussion of origin of\nthe magnetism in iron-pnictides and in connection with superconductivity is\npresented as well.\n", "  We introduce a class of conformal versions of the previously introduced\nquasi-conformal carpet cloak, and show how to construct such conformal cloaks\nfor different cloak shapes. Our method provides exact refractive-index profiles\nin closed mathematical form for the usual carpet cloak as well as for other\nshapes. By analyzing their asymptotic behavior, we find that the performance of\nfinite-size cloaks becomes much better for metal shapes with zero average\nvalue, e.g., for gratings.\n", "  Based on the high sensitivity of Compton scattering off ultra relativistic\nelectrons, the possibility of anisotropies in the speed of light is\ninvestigated. The result discussed in this contribution is based on the\ngamma-ray beam of the ESRF's GRAAL facility (Grenoble, France) and the search\nfor sidereal variations in the energy of the Compton-edge photons. The absence\nof oscillations yields the two-sided limit of 1.6 x 10^{-14} at 95 % confidence\nlevel on a combination of photon and electron coefficients of the minimal\nStandard Model Extension (mSME). This new constraint provides an improvement\nover previous bounds by one order of magnitude.\n", "  A technique is presented for finding the classical Lagrange function\ncorresponding to a given dispersion relation. This allows us to study the\nclassical analogue of the Standard-Model Extension. Developments are discussed.\n", "  The dynamical Maxwell-cut, a degeneracy is shown to be a precursor of\ncondensate in the phi4 and the sine-Gordon models. The difference of the way\nthe Maxwell-cut is obtained is pointed out and quantum censorship, the\ngeneration of semiclassically looking phenomenon by loop-corrections is\nconjectured in the sine-Gordon model. It is argued that quantum censorship and\ngluon confinement exclude each other.\n", "  We present the results of exclusive electroproduction of vector mesons on the\nproton at CLAS. We discuss the interpretation of these cross sections in terms\nof t-channel Reggeon exchanges and in terms of Generalized Parton Distributions\n(GPDs) formalism.\n", "  We discuss some of the basic features of extremal black holes in\nfour-dimensional extended supergravities. Firstly, all regular solutions\ndisplay an attractor behavior for the scalar field evolution towards the black\nhole horizon. Secondly, they can be obtained by solving first order flow\nequations even when they are not supersymmetric, provided one identifies a\nsuitable superpotential W which also gives the black hole entropy at the\nhorizon and its ADM mass at spatial infinity. We focus on N=8 supergravity and\nwe review the basic role played by U-duality of the underlying supergravity in\ndetermining the attractors, their entropies, their masses and in classifying\nboth regular and singular extremal black holes.\n", "  Solar-neutrino oscillations are considered using a massive model with\nperturbative Lorentz violation. The adiabatic approximation is used to\ncalculate the effects of Lorentz violation to leading order. The results are\nmore compact than previous work involving vacuum oscillations, and are accurate\nfor small Lorentz-violating coefficients.\n", "  The unitary Critical Pomeron connects to a unique massless left-handed SU(5)\ntheory that, remarkably, might provide an unconventional underlying unification\nfor the Standard Model. Multi-regge theory suggests the existence of a {\\it\nbound-state high-energy S-Matrix} that replicates Standard Model states and\ninteractions via massless fermion anomaly dynamics. Configurations of anomalous\nwee gauge boson reggeons play a vacuum-like role. All particles, including\nneutrinos, are bound-states with dynamical masses (there is no Higgs field)\nthat are formed (in part) by anomaly poles. The contributing zero-momentum\nchirality transitions break the SU(5) symmetry to vector SU(3)xU(1) in the\nS-Matrix. The high-energy interactions are vector reggeon exchanges accompanied\nby wee boson sums (odd-signature for the strong interaction and even-signature\nfor the electroweak interaction) that strongly enhance couplings. The very\nsmall SU(5) coupling, ~ 1/120, should be reflected in small (Majorana) neutrino\nmasses. A color sextet quark sector, still to be discovered, produces both Dark\nMatter and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking. Anomaly color factors imply this\nsector could be produced at the LHC with large cross-sections, and would be\ndefinitively identified in double pomeron processes.\n", "  In these notes we review recent progress (and, in Section \\ref{sec:ados}, we\nannounce a new result) concerning the statistical properties of the spectrum of\nWigner random matrices.\n", "  Water is the main component of interstellar ice mantles, is abundant in the\nsolar system and is a crucial ingredient for life. The formation of this\nmolecule in the interstellar medium cannot be explained by gas-phase chemistry\nonly and its surface hydrogenation formation routes at low temperatures (O, O2,\nO3 channels) are still unclear and most likely incomplete. In a previous paper\nwe discussed an unexpected zeroth-order H2O production behavior in O2 ice\nhydrogenation experiments compared to the first-order H2CO and CH3OH production\nbehavior found in former studies on hydrogenation of CO ice. In this paper we\nexperimentally investigate in detail how the structure of O2 ice leads to this\nrare behavior in reaction order and production yield. In our experiments H\natoms are added to a thick O2 ice under fully controlled conditions, while the\nchanges are followed by means of reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy\n(RAIRS). The H-atom penetration mechanism is systematically studied by varying\nthe temperature, thickness and structure of the O2 ice. We conclude that the\ncompetition between reaction and diffusion of the H atoms into the O2 ice\nexplains the unexpected H2O and H2O2 formation behavior. In addition, we show\nthat the proposed O2 hydrogenation scheme is incomplete, suggesting that\nadditional surface reactions should be considered. Indeed, the detection of\nnewly formed O3 in the ice upon H-atom exposure proves that the O2 channel is\nnot an isolated route. Furthermore, the addition of H2 molecules is found not\nto have a measurable effect on the O2 reaction channel.\n", "  Water is abundantly present in the Universe. It is the main component of\ninterstellar ice mantles and a key ingredient for life. Water in space is\nmainly formed through surface reactions. Three formation routes have been\nproposed in the past: hydrogenation of surface O, O2, and O3. In a previous\npaper [Ioppolo et al., Astrophys. J., 2008, 686, 1474] we discussed an\nunexpected non-standard zeroth-order H2O2 production behaviour in O2\nhydrogenation experiments, which suggests that the proposed reaction network is\nnot complete, and that the reaction channels are probably more interconnected\nthan previously thought. In this paper we aim to derive the full reaction\nscheme for O2 surface hydrogenation and to constrain the rates of the\nindividual reactions. This is achieved through simultaneous H-atom and O2\ndeposition under ultra-high vacuum conditions for astronomically relevant\ntemperatures. Different H/O2 ratios are used to trace different stages in the\nhydrogenation network. The chemical changes in the forming ice are followed by\nmeans of reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). New reaction\npaths are revealed as compared to previous experiments. Several reaction steps\nprove to be much more efficient (H + O2) or less efficient (H + OH and H2 + OH)\nthan originally thought. These are the main conclusions of this work and the\nextended network concluded here will have profound implications for models that\ndescribe the formation of water in space.\n", "  This contribution is devoted to a review of some recent results on existence,\nsymmetry and symmetry breaking of optimal functions for\nCaffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg and weighted logarithmic Hardy inequalities. These\nresults have been obtained in a series of papers in collaboration with M. del\nPino, S. Filippas, M. Loss, G. Tarantello and A. Tertikas and are presented\nfrom a new viewpoint.\n", "  I discuss the calculation of QCD jet rates in e+e- annihilation as a testing\nground for parton shower simulations and jet finding algorithms.\n", "  Probably the most enticing observation in theoretical physics during the last\ndecade was the discovery of the great amount of consequences obtained from the\nAdS/CFT conjecture put forward by Maldacena. In this work we review how this\ncorrespondence can be used to address hydrodynamic properties such as the\nviscosity of some strongly interacting systems. We also employ the Boltzmann\nequation for those systems closer to low-energy QCD, and argue that this kind\nof transport coefficients can be related to phase transitions, in particular\nthe QGP/hadronic phase transition studied in heavy ion collisions.\n", "  We review recent results on a mean-field model for relativistic electrons in\natoms and molecules, which allows to describe at the same time the\nself-consistent behavior of the polarized Dirac sea. We quickly derive this\nmodel from Quantum Electrodynamics and state the existence of solutions,\nimposing an ultraviolet cut-off $\\Lambda$. We then discuss the limit\n$\\Lambda\\to\\infty$ in detail, by resorting to charge renormalization.\n", "  The binding of polarons, or its absence, is an old and subtle topic. After\ndefining the model we state some recent theorems of ours. First, the transition\nfrom many-body collapse to the existence of a thermodynamic limit for N\npolarons occurs precisely at U=2\\alpha, where U is the electronic Coulomb\nrepulsion and \\alpha is the polaron coupling constant. Second, if U is large\nenough, there is no multi-polaron binding of any kind. We also discuss the\nPekar-Tomasevich approximation to the ground state energy, which is valid for\nlarge \\alpha. Finally, we derive exact results, not reported before, about the\none-dimensional toy model introduced by E. P. Gross.\n", "  Gribov viewed the axial anomaly as a manifestation of the collective motion\nof charged fermions with arbitrarily high momenta in the vacuum. In the\npresence of an external magnetic field and a chirality imbalance, this\ncollective motion becomes directly observable in the form of the electric\ncurrent - this is the chiral magnetic effect (CME). I give an elementary\nintroduction into the physics of CME, and discuss some recent developments.\n", "  We use the gauge/gravity correspondence to study the screening of a heavy\nquark-antiquark pair in various strongly coupled plasmas. Besides N=4 super\nYang-Mills theory and the corresponding AdS_5 space we also study theories\nobtained as deformations of AdS_5, among them in particular a class of\ndeformations solving supergravity equations of motion. We consider the\ndependence of the screening distance on the velocity and the orientation of the\npair in the plasma. The value of the screening distance in N=4 SYM is found to\nbe a minimum in the class of theories under consideration for all kinematic\nparameters.\n", "  I review a number of topics where conventional wisdom in hadron physics has\nbeen challenged. For example, hadrons can be produced at large transverse\nmomentum directly within a hard higher-twist QCD subprocess, rather than from\njet fragmentation. Such \"direct\" processes can explain the deviations from\nperturbative QCD predictions in measurements of inclusive hadron cross sections\nat fixed x_T= 2p_T/\\sqrt s, as well as the \"baryon anomaly\", the anomalously\nlarge proton-to-pion ratio seen in high centrality heavy ion collisions.\nInitial-state and final-state interactions of the struck quark lead to\nBjorken-scaling single-spin asymmetries, diffractive deep inelastic scattering,\nthe breakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions, as well as\nnuclear shadowing and antishadowing. The Gribov-Glauber theory predicts that\nantishadowing of nuclear structure functions is not universal, but instead\ndepends on the flavor quantum numbers of each quark and antiquark, thus\nexplaining the anomalous nuclear dependence measured in deep-inelastic neutrino\nscattering. One cannot attribute such phenomena to the structure of the hadron\nor nucleus itself. It is thus important to distinguish \"static\" structure\nfunctions computed from the square of the target light-front wavefunctions,\nversus \"dynamical\" structure functions which include the effects of the\nfinal-state rescattering of the struck quark. The importance of the J=0\nphoton-quark QCD contact interaction in deeply virtual Compton scattering is\nemphasized. The scheme-independent BLM method for setting the renormalization\nscale is discussed. Eliminating the renormalization scale ambiguity greatly\nimproves the precision of QCD predictions and increases the sensitivity of\nsearches for new physics at the LHC. Other novel features of QCD are discussed,\nincluding the consequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates.\n", "  We present new, wide and deep images in the 1.1 mm continuum and the\n$^{12}$CO ($J$=1-0) emission toward the northern part of the Orion A Giant\nMolecular Cloud (Orion-A GMC). The 1.1 mm data were taken with the AzTEC camera\nmounted on the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) 10 m telescope\nin Chile, and the $^{12}$CO ($J$=1-0) data were with the 25 beam receiver\n(BEARS) on the NRO 45 m telescope in the On-The-Fly (OTF) mode. The present\nAzTEC observations are the widest $(\\timeform{1.D7}$ $\\times$\n$\\timeform{2.D3}$, corresponding to 12 pc $\\times$ 17 pc) and the\nhighest-sensitivity ($\\sim$9 mJy beam$^{-1}$) 1.1 mm dust-continuum imaging of\nthe Orion-A GMC with an effective spatial resolution of $\\sim$ 40$\\arcsec$. The\n$^{12}$CO ($J$=1-0) image was taken over the northern $\\timeform{1D.2}\n\\times\\timeform{1D.2}$ (corresponding 9 pc $\\times$ 9 pc) area with a\nsensitivity of 0.93 K in $T_{\\rm MB}$, a velocity resolution of 1.0 km\ns$^{-1}$, and an effective spatial resolution of 21$\\arcsec$. With these data,\ntogether with the MSX 8 $\\mu$m, Spitzer 24 $\\mu$m and the 2MASS data, we have\ninvestigated the detailed structure and kinematics of molecular gas associated\nwith the Orion-A GMC and have found evidence for interactions between molecular\nclouds and the external forces that may trigger star formation. Two types of\npossible triggers were revealed; 1) Collision of the diffuse gas on the cloud\nsurface, particularly at the eastern side of the OMC-2/3 region, and 2)\nIrradiation of UV on the pre-existing filaments and dense molecular cloud\ncores. Our wide-field and high-sensitivity imaging have provided the first\ncomprehensive view of the potential sites of triggered star formation in the\nOrion-A GMC.\n", "  This proceedings contribution summarizes recent investigations of Lorentz\nviolation in matter-gravity couplings.\n", "  We review our recent work on linear stability for scalar perturbations of\nKerr spacetimes, that is to say, boundedness and decay properties for solutions\nof the scalar wave equation \\Box_g{\\psi} = 0 on Kerr exterior backgrounds. We\nbegin with the very slowly rotating case |a| \\ll M, where first boundedness and\nthen decay has been shown in rapid developments over the last two years,\nfollowing earlier progress in the Schwarzschild case a = 0. We then turn to the\ngeneral subextremal range |a| < M, where we give here for the first time the\nessential elements of a proof of definitive decay bounds for solutions {\\psi}.\nThese developments give hope that the problem of the non-linear stability of\nthe Kerr family of black holes might soon be addressed. This paper accompanies\na talk by one of the authors (I.R.) at the 12th Marcel Grossmann Meeting,\nParis, June 2009.\n", "  This note is an attempt to explain in simple words why the famous relation\n$E=mc^2$ misrepresents the essence of Einstein's relativity theory. The note is\naddressed to high-school teachers, and a part of it - to those university\nprofessors who permit themselves to say that the mass of a body increases with\nits velocity or momentum and thus mislead the teachers and their students.\n  -----\n  Contains both English and Russian versions.\n", "  We study two experimental ways to measure the heavy-quark content of the\nproton: using the Callan-Gross ratio $R(x,Q^2)=F_L/F_T$ and/or the azimuthal\n$\\cos(2\\phi)$ asymmetry in deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering. Our\napproach is based on the following observations. First, unlike the production\ncross sections, the ratio $R(x,Q^2)=F_L/F_T$ and the azimuthal $\\cos(2\\phi)$\nasymmetry in heavy-quark leptoproduction are sufficiently stable, both\nparametricallly and perturbatively, in a wide region of variables $x$ and $Q^2$\nwithin the fixed-flavor-number scheme of QCD. Second, both these quantities,\n$R(x,Q^2)=F_L/F_T$ and $\\cos(2\\phi)$ asymmetry, are sensitive to resummation of\nthe mass logarithms of the type $\\alpha_{s}\\ln\\left(Q^{2}/m^{2}\\right)$ within\nthe variable-flavor-number schemes. These two facts together imply that the\nheavy-quark densities in the nucleon can, in principle, be determined from\nhigh-$Q^2$ data on the Callan-Gross ratio and/or the azimuthal asymmetry in\nheavy-quark leptoproduction. In particular, the charm content of the proton can\nbe measured in future studies at the proposed Large Hadron-Electron (LHeC) and\nElectron-Ion (EIC) Colliders.\n", "  Examples of glasses are abundant, yet it remains one of the phases of matter\nwhose understanding is very elusive. In recent years, remarkable experiments\nhave been performed on the dynamical aspects of glasses. Electron glasses offer\na particularly good example of the 'trademarks' of glassy behavior, such as\naging and slow relaxations. In this work we review the experimental literature\non electron glasses, as well as the local mean-field theoretical framework put\nforward in recent years to understand some of these results. We also present\nnovel theoretical results explaining the periodic aging experiment.\n", "  This talk describes the resummation approach in (Fractional) Analytic\nPerturbation Theory (FAPT) in QCD. First, we make a short historical review of\nthe (F)APT approach and then shortly describe the global scheme of FAPT which\nallows one to take into account heavy-quark thresholds. After that we show how\nit is possible to resum a non-power series in (F)APT both in the one- and\ntwo-loop approximations. As an application we suggest our analysis of the Higgs\nboson decay ${H^0\\to b\\bar{b}}$, important for the LHC program, and of the\nvector-current Adler function.\n", "  We examine the evolution of the spatial counts-in-cells distribution of\ngalaxies and show that the form of the galaxy distribution function does not\nchange significantly as galaxies merge and evolve. In particular, bound merging\npairs follow a similar distribution to that of individual galaxies. From the\nadiabatic expansion of the universe we show how clustering, expansion and\ngalaxy mergers affect the clustering parameter b. We also predict the evolution\nof b with respect to redshift.\n", "  Observations of molecular clouds in the gamma ray domain provide us with a\ntool to study the distribution of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. This is because\ncosmic rays can penetrate molecular clouds, undergo hadronic interactions in\nthe dense gas, and produce neutral pions that in turn decay into gamma rays.\nThe detection of this radiation allows us to estimate the spectrum and\nintensity of cosmic rays at the cloud's position. Remarkably, this fact can be\nused to constrain the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient at specific locations in\nthe Galaxy.\n", "  We investigate the neutrino helicity-flip process under supernova core\nconditions, where the left-handed neutrinos being produced can be converted\ninto right-handed neutrinos sterile with respect to the weak interaction due to\nthe interaction of magnetic moments with plasma electrons and protons. Instead\nof the uniform ball model for the SN core used in previous analyses, realistic\nmodels for radial distributions and time evolution of physical parameters in\nthe supernova core are considered. We have obtained new upper limits on the\nDirac neutrino magnetic moment averaged over flavours and time from the\ncondition that the influence of the right-handed neutrino emission on the total\ncooling time scale should be limited.\n", "  In this article, I study the diffusive behavior for a quantum test particle\ninteracting with a dilute background gas. The model I begin with is a reduced\npicture for the test particle dynamics given by a quantum linear Boltzmann\nequation in which the gas particle scattering is assumed to occur through a\nhard-sphere interaction. The state of the particle is represented by a density\nmatrix that evolves according to a translation-covariant Lindblad equation. The\nmain result is a proof that the particle's position distribution converges to a\nGaussian under diffusive rescaling.\n", "  We briefly discuss new models of an `affine' theory of gravity in\nmultidimensional space-times with symmetric connections. We use and generalize\nEinstein's proposal to specify the space-time geometry by use of the Hamilton\nprinciple to determine the connection coefficients from a geometric Lagrangian\nthat is an arbitrary function of the generalized Ricci curvature tensor and of\nother fundamental tensors. Such a theory supplements the standard Einstein\ngravity with dark energy (the cosmological constant, in the first\napproximation), a neutral massive (or tachyonic) vector field vecton, and\nmassive (or tachyonic) scalar fields. These fields couple only to gravity and\ncan generate dark matter and/or inflation. The concrete choice of the geometric\nLagrangian determines further details of the theory. The most natural geometric\nmodels look similar to recently proposed brane models of cosmology usually\nderived from string theory.\n", "  Two different \"wave chaotic\" systems, involving complex eigenvalues or\nresonances, can be analyzed using common semiclassical methods. In particular,\none obtains fractal Weyl upper bounds for the density of resonances/eigenvalues\nnear the real axis, and a classical dynamical criterion for a spectral gap.\n", "  A leading hypothesis for the nature of the elusive dark matter are thermally\nproduced, weakly interacting massive particles that arise in many theories\nbeyond the standard model of particle physics. Their self-annihilation in\nastrophysical regions of high density provides a potential means of indirectly\ndetecting dark matter through the annihilation products, which nicely\ncomplements direct and collider searches. Here, I review the case of gamma rays\nwhich are particularly promising in this respect: distinct and unambiguous\nspectral signatures would not only allow a clear discrimination from\nastrophysical backgrounds but also to extract important properties of the dark\nmatter particles; powerful observational facilities like the Fermi Gamma-ray\nSpace Telescope or upcoming large, ground-based Cherenkov telescope arrays will\nbe able to probe a considerable part of the underlying, e.g. supersymmetric,\nparameter space. I conclude with a more detailed comparison of indirect and\ndirect dark matter searches, showing that these two approaches are, indeed,\ncomplementary.\n", "  Almost 40 years ago, Gribov and colleagues at the Leningrad Nuclear Physics\nInstitute developed the ideas that led to the\nDokhsitzer-Gribov-Altarelli-Parisi the Baltisky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov equations.\nThese equations describe the evolution of the distributions for quarks and\ngluon inside a hadron to increased resolution scale of a probe or to smaller\nvalues of the fractional momentum of a hadronic constituent. I motivate and\ndiscuss the generalization required of these equations needed for high energy\nprocesses when the density of constituents is large. This leads to a theory of\nsaturation realized by the Color Glass Condensate\n", "  We show how to translate recent results on effective Hamiltonians for quantum\nsystems constrained to a submanifold by a sharply peaked potential to quantum\nsystems on thin Dirichlet tubes. While the structure of the problem and the\nform of the effective Hamiltonian stays the same, the difficulties in the\nproofs are different.\n", "  Evolution is the fundamental physical process that gives rise to biological\nphenomena. Yet it is widely treated as a subset of population genetics, and\nthus its scope is artificially limited. As a result, the key issues of how\nrapidly evolution occurs, and its coupling to ecology have not been\nsatisfactorily addressed and formulated. The lack of widespread appreciation\nfor, and understanding of, the evolutionary process has arguably retarded the\ndevelopment of biology as a science, with disastrous consequences for its\napplications to medicine, ecology and the global environment. This review\nfocuses on evolution as a problem in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics,\nwhere the key dynamical modes are collective, as evidenced by the plethora of\nmobile genetic elements whose role in shaping evolution has been revealed by\nmodern genomic surveys. We discuss how condensed matter physics concepts might\nprovide a useful perspective in evolutionary biology, the conceptual failings\nof the modern evolutionary synthesis, the open-ended growth of complexity, and\nthe quintessentially self-referential nature of evolutionary dynamics.\n", "  We review a recently proven Lieb-Robinson bound for general, many-body\nquantum systems with bounded interactions. Several basic examples are discussed\nas well as the connection between commutator estimates and quasi-locality.\n", "  In the space environment, instruments onboard of spacecrafts can be affected\nby displacement damage due to radiation. The differential scattering cross\nsection for screened nucleus--nucleus interactions - i.e., including the\neffects due to screened Coulomb nuclear fields -, nuclear stopping powers and\nnon-ionization energy losses are treated from about 50 keV/nucleon up to\nrelativistic energies.\n", "  The solar modulation, a combination of diffusion, convection, magnetic drift\nand energy loss inside the heliosphere is usually seen as a depletion in the\nGalactic cosmic ray (CR) flux at low energy (less than 10 GeV/nuc).\nAntiparticles such as antiprotons or positrons undergo the same processes of\nrespective particles but with a different magnitude depending on the Solar\nmagnetic field polarity. For electrons and positrons, due to the small mass,\nenergy loss mechanisms as inverse compton, synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and\nionization have to be taken into account, together with the typical adiabatic\nlosses considered in the heliosphere. We developed a Monte Carlo stochastic\nsimulation with the aim to compare the solar modulation of particles and\nantiparticles in the same observation period. We are able to estimate the\ndifferent behaviours associated to the charge sign dependent processes of the\nheliospheric modulation. We compared the simulated positron fraction with\nmeasurements performed by AMS-01 and PAMELA. We also present the prediction for\nthe AMS-02 experiment.\n", "  The energy dependence of the local ${\\cal P}$ and ${\\cal CP}$ violation in\nAu+Au and Cu+Cu collisions in a large energy range is estimated within a simple\nphenomenological model. It is expected that at LHC the chiral magnetic effect\nwill be about 20 times weaker than at RHIC. At lower energy range, covered by\nthe low-energy scan at RHIC and future NICA/FAIR facilities, the created\nmagnetic field strength and energy density of deconfined matter are rather high\nproviding necessary conditions for the chiral magnetic effect. However, the\nparticular model for the chiral magnetic effect predicts that this effect\nshould vanish sharply at energy somewhere above the top SPS one. To elucidate\nCME background effects the Hadron-String-Dynamics (HSD) transport model\nincluding electromagnetic fields is put forward. Importance of new planning\nexperiments at LHC and for the low-energy RHIC scan program is emphasized.\n", "  We investigate the theoretical and observational implications of the\nacceleration of protons and heavier nuclei in supernova remnants (SNRs). By\nadopting a semi-analytical technique, we study the non-linear interplay among\nparticle acceleration, magnetic field generation and shock dynamics, outlining\na self-consistent scenario for the origin of the spectrum of Galactic cosmic\nrays as produced in this class of sources. Moreover, the inferred chemical\nabundances suggest nuclei heavier than Hydrogen to be relevant not only in the\nshock dynamics but also in the calculation of the gamma-ray emission from SNRs\ndue to the decay of neutral pions produced in nuclear interactions.\n", "  Recent measurements of cosmic ray electron energy spectra suggest that above\n10 GeV there may be deviations from a single power law spectrum. There are\nhints (ATIC) for a bump occurring between 100 GeV and 1TeV, meaning that there\nmight be more high energy electrons than expected. Whether these electrons are\nproduced within pulsar magnetospheres, or due to Dark Matter annihilation or\ndecay, this is still matter of debate. Understanding the nature of these ultra\nhigh energy particles is a difficult task that can be fulfilled using all the\navailable astrophysical observables. We investigate how different energy\nspectra produce different observable manifestations in the\nradio/microwave/mm-wave domain, where corresponding deviations from a\nsynchrotron power law could appear. We raise the question around the\ndetectability of these possible radio spectral features, which may be\ninteresting for a wide scientific community including astrophysicists and\nscientists working on foregrounds removal for CMB experiments.\n", "  Spectra of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) measured at the Earth are the\ncombination of several processes: sources production and acceleration,\npropagation in the interstellar medium and propagation in the heliosphere.\nInside the solar cavity the flux of GCRs is reduced due to the solar\nmodulation, the interaction which they have with the interplanetary medium. We\nrealized a 2D stochastic simulation of solar modulation to reproduce CR spectra\nat the Earth, and evaluated the importance in our results of the Local\nInterstellar Spectrum (LIS) model and its agreement with data at high energy.\nWe show a good agreement between our model and the data taken by AMS-01 and\nBESS experiments during periods with different solar activity conditions.\nFurthermore we made a prediction for the flux which will be measured by AMS-02\nexperiment.\n", "  We review some recent results concerning Landau levels and Tomita-Takesaki\nmodular theory. We also extend the general framework behind this to quasi\n*-algebras, to take into account the possible appearance of unbounded\nobservables.\n", "  We examine the scaling trends in particle multiplicity and flow observables\nbetween SPS, RHIC and LHC, and discuss their compatibility with popular\ntheoretical models. We examine the way scaling trends between SPS and RHIC are\nbroken at LHC energies, and suggest experimental measurements which can further\nclarify the situation\n", "  We present the non-linear theory of shock acceleration applied to SNRs\nexpanding into partially neutral plasma. Using this theory we show how the\nBalmer lines detected from young SNRs can be used to test the efficiency of\nshocks in the production of cosmic rays. In particular we investigate the\neffect of charge-exchange between protons and neutral hydrogen occurring in the\nprecursor formed ahead of the shock. In this precursor the CR pressure\naccelerate the ionized component of the plasma and a relative velocity between\nprotons and neutral hydrogen is established. On the other hand the\ncharge-exchange process tends to equilibrate ions and neutrals resulting in the\nheating of both components. We show that even when the shock converts only a\nfew per cent of the total bulk kinetic energy into CRs, the heating is\nefficient enough to produce a detectable broadening of the narrow Balmer lines\nemitted by the neutral hydrogen.\n", "  Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) are mainly protons confined in the galactic\nmagnetic field to form an isotropic flux inside the galaxy. Before reaching the\nEarth orbit they enter the Heliosphere and undergo diffusion, convection,\nmagnetic drift and adiabatic energy loss. The result is a reduction of\nparticles flux at low energy (below 10 GeV), called solar modulation. We\nrealized a quasi time-dependent 2D Stochastic Simulation of Solar Modulation\nthat is able to reproduce CR spectra once known the Local Interstellar Spectrum\n(LIS). We were able to estimate the different behaviors associated to the\npolarity dependence of the Heliospheric modulation for particles as well as for\nantiparticles. We show a good agreement with the antiproton/proton ratio\nmeasured by AMS-01, Pamela, BESS, Heat and Caprice and we performed a\nprediction for the AMS-02 Experiment.\n", "  We discuss recent results concerning the ground state of non-relativistic\nquantum electrodynamics as a function of a magnetic coupling constant or the\nfine structure constant, obtained by the authors in [12,13,14].\n", "  The double-peak structure observed in soft-hard dihadron correlations was\nrecently studied intensively in order to learn more about the jet-induced\nmedium excitation in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Experimental data\nshows that the double-peak structure obtained for soft trigger particles\ncoalesces into one peak for harder trigger particles. We demonstrate that this\neffect occurs when averaging over many jet events in a transversally expanding\nbackground, while a hot spot scenario always leads to two distinct peaks. This\nsuggests to study soft-hard correlations induced by heavy-flavor jets with\nthose generated by light-flavor jets at RHIC and LHC in order to really\ndisentangle medium effects from jets.\n", "  Structural quantities such as order parameters and correlation functions are\noften employed to gain insight into the physical behavior and properties of\ncondensed matter systems. While standard quantities for characterizing\nstructure exist, often they are insufficient for treating problems in the\nemerging field of nano and microscale self-assembly, where the structures\nencountered may be complex and unusual. The computer science field of \"shape\nmatching\" offers a robust solution to this problem by defining diverse methods\nfor quantifying the similarity between arbitrarily complex shapes. Most order\nparameters and correlation functions used in condensed matter apply a specific\nmeasure of structural similarity within the context of a broader scheme. By\nsubstituting shape matching quantities for traditional quantities, we retain\nthe essence of the broader scheme, but extend its applicability to more complex\nstructures. Here we review some standard shape matching techniques and discuss\nhow they might be used to create highly flexible structural metrics for diverse\nsystems such as self-assembled matter. We provide three proof-of-concept\nexample problems applying shape matching methods to identifying local and\nglobal structures, and tracking structural transitions in complex assembled\nsystems. The shape matching methods reviewed here are applicable to a wide\nrange of condensed matter systems, both simulated and experimental, provided\nparticle positions are known or can be accurately imaged.\n", "  We review the main observational and theoretical facts about acceleration of\nGalactic cosmic rays in supernova remnants, discussing the arguments in favor\nand against a connection between cosmic rays and supernova remnants, the\nso-called supernova remnant paradigm for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.\nRecent developments in the modeling of the mechanism of diffusive shock\nacceleration are discussed, with emphasis on the role of 1) magnetic field\namplification, 2) acceleration of nuclei heavier than hydrogen, 3) presence of\nneutrals in the circumstellar environment. The status of the supernova-cosmic\nray connection in the time of Fermi-LAT and Cherenkov telescopes is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  A reduction of the mass of the eta'(958) meson may signal restoration of the\nU_A(1) symmetry in a hot and dense hadronic matter, corresponding to the return\nof the 9th, \"prodigal\" Goldstone boson. We report on an analysis of a combined\nPHENIX and STAR data set on the intercept parameter of the two-pion\nBose-Einstein correlation functions, as measuremed in sqrt(s(NN)) = 200 GeV Au\n+ Au collisions at RHIC. To describe this combined PHENIX and STAR dataset, an\nin-medium eta' mass reduction of at least 200 MeV is needed, at the 99.9 %\nconfidence level in a broad model class of resonance abundances.\n", "  The Polyakov loop is included in the SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R chiral quark-meson\nmodel by considering the propagation of the constituent quarks, coupled to the\n(sigma,pi) meson multiplet, on the homogeneous background of a temporal gauge\nfield, diagonal in color space. The model is solved at finite temperature and\nquark baryon chemical potential both in the chiral limit and for the physical\nvalue of the pion mass by using an expansion in the number of flavors N_f.\nKeeping the fermion propagator at its tree-level, a resummation on the pion\npropagator is constructed which resums infinitely many orders in 1/N_f, where\nO(1/N_f) represents the order at which the fermions start to contribute in the\npion propagator. The influence of the Polyakov loop on the tricritical or the\ncritical point in the mu_q-T phase diagram is studied for various forms of the\nPolyakov loop potential.\n", "  We study the kinetic and chemical equilibration in 'infinite' parton-hadron\nmatter within the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics transport approach, which is\nbased on a dynamical quasiparticle model for partons matched to reproduce\nlattice-QCD results - including the partonic equation of state - in\nthermodynamic equilibrium. The 'infinite' matter is simulated within a cubic\nbox with periodic boundary conditions initialized at different baryon density\n(or chemical potential) and energy density. The transition from initially pure\npartonic matter to hadronic degrees of freedom (or vice versa) occurs\ndynamically by interactions. Different thermodynamical distributions of the\nstrongly-interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) are addressed and discussed.\n", "  A 1+3 dimensional solution of relativistic hydrodynamics is analyzed in this\npaper. Momentum distribution and other observables are calculated from the\nsolution and compared to hadronic measurements from the Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider (RHIC). The solution is compatible with the data, but only the\nfreeze-out point of the evolution is determined. Many equation of states and\ninitial states (initial temperatures) are valid with the same freeze-out\ndistribution, thus the same hadronic observables. The observable that would\ndistinguish between these initial temperatures is momentum distribution of\nphotons, as photons are created throughout the evolution of the fireball\ncreated in RHIC collisions. The PHENIX experiment at RHIC measures such data\nvia low invariant mass e+e- pairs. Average temperature from this data is\nT=221+-23+-18 MeV, while a model calculation with initial temperature 370 MeV\nagree with the data.\n", "  Fermilab operates the world's most intense antiproton source. Newly proposed\nexperiments can use those antiprotons either parasitically during Tevatron\nCollider running or after the Tevatron Collider finishes. For example, the\nannihilation of 8 GeV antiprotons is expected to yield world-leading\nsensitivities to hyperon rare decays and CP violation. It could also provide\nthe world's most intense source of tagged D^0 mesons, and thus the best\nnear-term opportunity to study charm mixing and, via CP violation, to search\nfor new physics. Other precision measurements that could be made include\nproperties of the X(3872) and the charmonium system. An experiment using a\nPenning trap and an atom interferometer could make the world's first\nmeasurement of the gravitational force on antimatter. These and other potential\nmeasurements using antiprotons could lead to a broad physics program at\nFermilab in the post-Tevatron era.\n", "  In over two years of operation Fermi-LAT has revolutionized our knowledge of\nthe gamma-ray sky. Interstellar gamma rays are part of this new era and allow\nunprecedented tests for models of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. The extension to\nlower energies with INTEGRAL/SPI data is also evolving. The global\nmultiwavelength luminosity of the Milky Way has been derived, with implications\nfor the Galactic energy balance and the radio-FIR correlation.\n", "  We try to interpret the recently updated measurement of the cosmic ray\nelectron (CRE) spectrum observed by Fermi-LAT, together with PAMELA data on\npositron fraction, in a single-component scenario adopting different\npropagation setups; we find that the model is not adequate to reproduce the two\ndatasets, so the evidence of an extra primary component of electrons and\npositrons is strengthened. Instead, a double component scenario computed in a\nKraichnan-like diffusion setup (which is suggested by B/C and $\\bar{p}$ data)\ngives a satisfactory fit of all exisiting measurements. We confirm that nearby\npulsars are good source candidates for the required $e^\\pm$ extra-component and\nwe show that the predicted CRE anisotropy in our scenario is compatible with\nFermi-LAT recently published constraints.\n", "  Transport coefficeints, in particular the shear viscosity to entropy density\nratio is studied in systems where the small-width quasiparticle assumption is\nnot valid. It is found that $\\eta/s$ has no unversal lower bound, the minimal\nvalue depends on the system and the temperature, and can be even zero. We\nconstruct models where the $1/4\\pi$ conjectured bound is violated.\n", "  We show by explicit construction that for every solution of the\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equation in $p+1$ dimensions, there is a uniquely\nassociated \"dual\" solution of the vacuum Einstein equations in $p+2$\ndimensions. The dual geometry has an intrinsically flat timelike boundary\nsegment $\\Sigma_c$ whose extrinsic curvature is given by the stress tensor of\nthe Navier-Stokes fluid. We consider a \"near-horizon\" limit in which $\\Sigma_c$\nbecomes highly accelerated. The near-horizon expansion in gravity is shown to\nbe mathematically equivalent to the hydrodynamic expansion in fluid dynamics,\nand the Einstein equation reduces to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation.\nFor $p=2$, we show that the full dual geometry is algebraically special Petrov\ntype II. The construction is a mathematically precise realization of\nsuggestions of a holographic duality relating fluids and horizons which began\nwith the membrane paradigm in the 70's and resurfaced recently in studies of\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence.\n", "  In these notes we review aspects of semi-realistic particle physics from the\npoint of view of type II orientifold compactifications. We discuss the\nappearance of gauge theories on spacetime filling D-branes which wrap\nnon-trivial cycles in the Calabi-Yau. Chiral matter can appear at their\nintersections, with a natural interpretation of family replication given by the\ntopological intersection number. We discuss global consistency, including\ntadpole cancellation and the generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism, and also the\nimportance of related global $U(1)$ symmetries for superpotential couplings. We\nreview the basics of D-instantons, which can generate superpotential\ncorrections to charged matter couplings forbidden by the global $U(1)$\nsymmetries and may play an important role in moduli stabilization. Finally, for\nthe purpose of studying the landscape, we discuss certain advantages of\nstudying quiver gauge theories which arise from type II orientifold\ncompactifications rather than globally defined models. We utilize the type IIa\ngeometric picture and CFT techniques to illustrate the main physical points,\nthough sometimes we supplement the discussion from the type IIb perspective\nusing complex algebraic geometry.\n", "  By using the dressed Polyakov loop or dual chiral condensate as an equivalent\norder parameter of the deconfinement phase transition, we investigate the\nrelation between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions at finite\ntemperature and density in the framework of three-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio\n(NJL) model. It is found that in the chiral limit, the critical temperature for\nchiral phase transition coincides with that of the dressed Polyakov loop in the\nwhole $(T,\\mu)$ plane. In the case of explicit chiral symmetry breaking, it is\nfound that the phase transitions are flavor dependent. For each flavor, the\ntransition temperature for chiral restoration $T_c^{\\chi}$ is smaller than that\nof the dressed Polyakov loop $T_c^{{\\cal D}}$ in the low baryon density region\nwhere the transition is a crossover, and, the two critical temperatures\ncoincide in the high baryon density region where the phase transition is of\nfirst order. Therefore, there are two critical end points, i.e, $T_{CEP}^{u,d}$\nand $T_{CEP}^{s}$ at finite density. We also explain the feature of\n$T_c^{\\chi}=T_c^{\\cal D}$ in the case of 1st and 2nd order phase transitions,\nand $T_c^{\\chi}<T_c^{\\cal D}$ in the case of crossover, and expect this feature\nis general and can be extended to full QCD theory.\n", "  Resonance production and decay into pion pairs is simulated in a\nnon-extensive quark matter with multi-particle interactions. Final state pion\nspectra are found to take the form of the Tsallis distribution, in accordance\nwith measurements. It has also been shown that, if a large number of particles\nwith these multi-particle interactions are constrained to a constant energy\nhyper-surface in phase space, the one-particle distribution is the Tsallis\ndistribution.\n", "  In this contribution we will discuss two aspects of the matter created in\nultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. First we will attempt to define a\nuniversal measure for the fluidity of a substance, which will allow a correct\ncomparison between the fluidity of a Quark Gluon Plasma and any well known\nsubstance. Second we will discuss current measurements of particle correlations\nand their implication for possible local parity violation.\n", "  In this talk I discuss three recent developments in the theoretical\nunderstanding of the phase diagram of the strong interaction. The first topic\ndeals with the comparison of model calculations of the quark-hadron transition\nat vanishing quark chemical potential with state-of-the-art lattice QCD\nresults. In the second relates to the size of a possible 'quarkyonic phase'.\nThe third deals with the occurence of inhomogeneous chiral phases.\n", "  We develop the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism for classical field theory on\ngeneric globally hyperbolic spacetimes. A crucial aspect of our treatment is\nthe incorporation of the principle of local covariance which amounts to\nformulate the theory without reference to a distinguished spacetime. In\nparticular, this allows a homological construction of the Poisson algebra of\nobservables in classical gravity. Our methods heavily rely on the differential\ngeometry of configuration spaces of classical fields.\n", "  We introduce a model for ionic electrodiffusion and osmotic water flow\nthrough cells and tissues. The model consists of a system of partial\ndifferential equations for ionic concentration and fluid flow with interface\nconditions at deforming membrane boundaries. The model satisfies a natural\nenergy equality, in which the sum of the entropic, elastic and electrostatic\nfree energies are dissipated through viscous, electrodiffusive and osmotic\nflows. We discuss limiting models when certain dimensionless parameters are\nsmall. Finally, we develop a numerical scheme for the one-dimensional case and\npresent some simple applications of our model to cell volume control.\n", "  This is a set of four lectures presented at the Theoretical Advanced Study\nInstitute (TASI-09) in June 2009. I provide an introduction to experiments\ndesigned to detect WIMP dark matter directly, focusing on building intuitive\nunderstanding of the characteristics of potential WIMP signals and the\nexperimental techniques. After deriving the characteristics of potential\nsignals in direct-detection experiments for standard WIMP models, I summarize\nthe general experimental methods shared by most direct-detection experiments\nand review the advantages, challenges, and status of such searches (as of late\n2009). Experiments are already probing SUSY models, with best limits on the\nspin-independent coupling below 10^-7 pb.\n", "  We investigate the structure of the [bmim][Tf2N]/silica interface by\nsimulating the indentation of a thin (4 nm) [bmim][Tf2N] film by a hard\nnanometric tip. The ionic liquid/silica interface is represented in atomistic\ndetail, while the tip is modelled by a spherical mesoscopic particle\ninteracting via an effective short-range potential. Plots of the normal force\n(Fz) on the tip as a function of its distance from the silica surface highlight\nthe effect of weak layering in the ionic liquid structure, as well as the\nprogressive loss of fluidity in approaching the silica surface. The simulation\nresults for Fz are in near-quantitative agreement with new AFM data measured on\nthe same [bmim][Tf2N]/silica interface at comparable thermodynamic conditions.\n", "  We discuss some problems of dissipative chaos for open quantum systems in the\nframework of semiclassical and quantum distributions. For this goal, we propose\na driven nonlinear oscillator with time-dependent coefficients, i.e. with\ntime-dependent Kerr-nonlinearity and time-modulated driving field. This model\nshowing both regular and chaotic dynamics in the classical limit is realized in\nseveral experimental schemes. Quantum dissipative chaos is analyzed on the base\nof numerical method of quantum trajectories. Three quantities are studied: the\nWigner function of oscillatory mode from the point of view of quantum-assemble\ntheory and both semiclassical Poincare section and quantum Poincare section\ncalculated on a single quantum trajectory. The comparatively analysis of these\ndistributions for various operational chaotic regimes of the models is\nperformed, as well as scaling invariance in dissipative chaos and quantum\ninterference effects assisted by chaos are discussed.\n", "  Flat electrical charged black holes in 5-dimensional anti-de Sitter space\nhave been applied to the study of the phase diagram of quark matter via AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. In such application it is argued that since the temperature of\nthe quark gluon plasma is bounded away from zero, the dual black hole cannot be\narbitrarily cold, but becomes unstable due to stringy instability once it\nreaches sufficiently low temperature. We study the stringy stability of flat\ndilaton black holes with dilaton coupling $\\alpha=1$ in asymptotically anti-de\nSitter space and show that unlike the purely electrically charged black hole,\nthese dilaton black holes do not suffer from stringy instability.\n", "  In this paper, we have considered the generalized Ricci dark energy (GRDE)\nand generalized holographic dark energy (GHDE) in the scenario of emergent\nuniverse. Fractional energy density and deceleration parameters for GRDE were\nderived under emergent universe scenario. Also role of GRDE on the Chameleon\nfield in the emergent universe scenario has been examined. Finally, the\nbehaviours of the Chameleon scalar field $\\phi$, corresponding potential $V$\nand associated function $f$ were investigated in presence of GRDE.\n", "  A two component model describing the electromagnetic nucleon structure\nfunctions in the low-x region, based on generalized vector dominance and color\ndipole approaches is briefly described.\n", "  Fast thermalization and a strong build up of elliptic flow of QCD matter were\ninvestigated within the pQCD based 3+1 dimensional parton transport model BAMPS\nincluding bremsstrahlung $2 \\leftrightarrow 3$ processes. Within the same\nframework quenching of gluonic jets in Au+Au collisions at RHIC can be\nunderstood. The development of conical structure by gluonic jets is\ninvestigated in a static box for the regimes of small and large dissipation.\nFurthermore we demonstrate two different approaches to extract the shear\nviscosity coefficient $\\eta$ from a microscopical picture.\n", "  If supersymmetry turns out to be a symmetry of nature at low energies, the\nfirst order of business to measure the soft breaking parameters. But one will\nalso want to understand the symmetry, and its breaking, more microscopically.\nTwo aspects of this problem constitute the focus of these lectures. First, what\nsorts of dynamics might account for supersymmetry breaking, and its\nmanifestation at low energies. Second, how might these features fit into string\ntheory (or whatever might be the underlying theory in the ultraviolet). The\nlast few years have seen a much improved understanding of the first set of\nquestions, and at least a possible pathway to address the second.\n", "  A three flavor linear sigma model with vector and axial-vector mesons is\ndiscussed. Preliminary results concerning on the symmetry breaking pattern, the\nquestion of parameterization, as well as the resulting meson masses are\npresented.\n", "  We present the current status of hybrid approaches to describe heavy ion\ncollisions and their future challenges and perspectives. First we present a\nhybrid model combining a Boltzmann transport model of hadronic degrees of\nfreedom in the initial and final state with an optional hydrodynamic evolution\nduring the dense and hot phase. Second, we present a recent extension of the\nhydrodynamical model to include fluctuations near the phase transition by\ncoupling a chiral field to the hydrodynamic evolution.\n", "  A new future for metamaterials is suggested, involving the insertion of\nquantum degrees of freedom, under the guise of quantum dots or cold atoms, in\nan photonic matrix. It is argued that new emergent, quantum, properties could\nbe obtained.\n", "  The method of passive imaging in seismology has been developped recently in\norder to image the earth crust from recordings of the seismic noise. This\nmethod is founded on the computation of correlations of the seismic noise. In\nthis paper, we give an explicit formula for this correlation in the\n\"semi-classical\" regime. In order to do that, we define the power spectrum of a\nrandom field as the ensemble average of its Wigner measure, this allows\nphase-space computations: the pseudo-differential calculus and the ray theory.\nThis way, we get a formula for the correlation of the seismic noise in the\nsemi-classcial regime with a source noise which can be localized and non\nhomogeneous. After that, we show how the use of surface guided waves allows to\nimage the earth crust.\n", "  We provide global formulations of Vasiliev's four-dimensional minimal bosonic\nhigher spin gravities by identifying structure groups, soldering one-forms and\nclassical observables. In the unbroken phase, we examine how decorated Wilson\nloops collapse to zero-form charges and exploit them to enlarge the Vasiliev\nsystem with new interactions. We propose a metric phase whose characteristic\nobservables are minimal areas of higher spin metrics and on shell closed\nabelian forms of positive even degrees. We show that the four-form is an on\nshell deformation of the generalized Hamiltonian action recently proposed by\nBoulanger and one of the authors. In the metric phase, we also introduce\ntensorial coset coordinates and demonstrate how single derivatives with respect\nto coordinates of higher ranks factorize into multiple derivatives with respect\nto coordinates of lower ranks.\n", "  In this paper we show how to compute the shear relaxation time from an\nunderlying microscopic theory. We prove that the shear relaxation time in\nIsrael-Stewart-type theories is given by the inverse of the pole of the\ncorresponding retarded Green's function, which is nearest to the origin in the\ncomplex energy plane. Consequently, the relaxation time in such theories is a\nmicroscopic, and not a macroscopic, i.e., fluid-dynamical time scale.\n", "  We show in the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach that unambiguous correlations\nexist between observables of finite nuclei and nuclear matter properties. Using\nthis correlation analysis to existing data on the neutron skin thickness of Sn\nisotopes, we find important constraints on the value E_{sym}(rho_0) and density\nslope L of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density. Combining these\nconstraints with those from recent analyses of isospin diffusion and double\nneutron/proton ratio in heavy ion collisions leads to a value of L=58\\pm 18 MeV\napproximately independent of E_{sym}(\\rho_0).\n", "  We discuss the spectrum of the tensor metric perturbations and the stability\nof warped compactifications with the de Sitter spacetime in the\nhigher-dimensional gravity. The spacetime structure is given in terms of the\nwarped product of the non-compact direction, the spherical internal dimensions\nand the four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. To realize a finite bulk volume,\nwe construct the brane world model, using the cut-copy-paste method. Then, we\ncompactify the spherical directions on the brane. In any case, we show the\nexistence of the massless zero mode and the mass gap of it with massive\nKaluza-Klein modes. Although the brane involves the spherical dimensions, no\nlight massive mode is excited. We also investigate the scalar perturbations,\nand show that the model is unstable due to the existence of a tachyonic bound\nstate, which seems to have the universal negative mass square, irrespective of\nthe number of spacetime dimensions.\n", "  Unlike their model membrane counterparts, biological membranes are richly\ndecorated with a heterogeneous assembly of membrane proteins. These proteins\nare so tightly packed that their excluded area interactions can alter the free\nenergy landscape controlling the conformational transitions suffered by such\nproteins. For membrane channels, this effect can alter the critical membrane\ntension at which they undergo a transition from a closed to an open state, and\ntherefore influence protein function \\emph{in vivo}. Despite their obvious\nimportance, crowding phenomena in membranes are much less well studied than in\nthe cytoplasm.\n  Using statistical mechanics results for hard disk liquids, we show that\ncrowding induces an entropic tension in the membrane, which influences\ntransitions that alter the projected area and circumference of a membrane\nprotein. As a specific case study in this effect, we consider the impact of\ncrowding on the gating properties of bacterial mechanosensitive membrane\nchannels, which are thought to confer osmoprotection when these cells are\nsubjected to osmotic shock. We find that crowding can alter the gating energies\nby more than $2\\;k_BT$ in physiological conditions, a substantial fraction of\nthe total gating energies in some cases.\n  Given the ubiquity of membrane crowding, the nonspecific nature of excluded\nvolume interactions, and the fact that the function of many membrane proteins\ninvolve significant conformational changes, this specific case study highlights\na general aspect in the function of membrane proteins.\n", "  These lecture notes give an introduction to a number of ideas and methods\nthat have been useful in the study of complex systems ranging from spin glasses\nto D-branes on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Topics include the replica formalism,\nParisi's solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, overlap order\nparameters, supersymmetric quantum mechanics, D-brane landscapes and their\nblack hole duals.\n", "  A maximum entropy-based framework is presented for the synthesis of\nprojections from multiple Earth climate models. This identifies the most\nrepresentative (most probable) model from a set of climate models -- as defined\nby specified constraints -- eliminating the need to calculate the entire set.\nTwo approaches are developed, based on individual climate models or ensembles\nof models, subject to a single cost (energy) constraint or competing\ncost-benefit constraints. A finite-time limit on the minimum cost of modifying\na model synthesis framework, at finite rates of change, is also reported.\n", "  General properties of hadron production are investigated in proton-proton\ncollisions at LHC energies. We are interested in the characteristics of hadron\nproduction outside the identified jet cones. We improve earlier definitions and\nintroduce surrounding rings/belts around the cone of identified jets. In this\nway even multiple jet events can be studied in details. We define the\nunderlying event as collected hadrons from outside jet cones and outside\nsurrounding belts, and investigate the features of these hadrons. We use a\nPYTHIA generated data sample of proton-proton collisions at s = (7 TeV)^2. This\ndata sample is analysed by our new method and the widely applied CDF method.\nAngular correlations and momentum distributions have been studied and the\nobtained results are compared and discussed.\n", "  We study two designed and one natural zinc-finger peptide each with the\nCys2His2 (CCHH) type of metal binding motif. In the approach we have developed,\nwe describe the role of the protein and solvent outside the Zn(II)-CCHH\nmetal-residue cluster by a molecular field represented by generalized harmonic\nrestraints. The strength of the field is adjusted to reproduce the binding\nenergy distribution of the metal with the cluster obtained in a reference\nall-atom simulation with empirical potentials. The quadratic field allows us to\ninvestigate analytically the protein restraints on the binding site in terms of\nits eigenmodes. Examining these eigenmodes suggests, consistent with\nexperimental observations, the importance of the first histidine (H) in the\nCCHH cluster in metal binding. Further, the eigenvalues corresponding to these\nmodes also indicate that the designed proteins form a tighter complex with the\nmetal. We find that the bulk protein and solvent response tends to destabilize\nmetal-binding, emphasizing that the favorable energetics of metal-residue\ninteraction is necessary to drive folding in this system. The representation of\nthe bulk protein and solvent response by a local field allows us to perform\nMonte Carlo simulations of the metal-residue cluster using quantum-chemical\napproaches, here using a semi-empirical Hamiltonian. For configurations sampled\nfrom this simulation, we study the free energy of replacing Zn(II) with Fe(II),\nCo(II), and Ni(II) using density functional theory. The calculated\nselectivities are in fair agreement with experimental results.\n", "  We analyze, by means of numerical simulations, transmission enhancements\nthrough sub- wavelength slits due to the presence of sets of plasmonic\nnanocylinders, placed near the exit of these apertures. Further, we extend this\nstudy to photonic crystals of dipolar plasmonic particles in front of an array\nof extraordinarily transmitting slits practiced in a metallic slab.\n", "  We address the scattering cross sections, and their consequences, for\nsubmicrometer Germanium spheres. It is shown that there is a wide window in the\nnear infrared where light scattering by these particles is fully described by\ntheir induced electric and magnetic dipoles. In this way, we observe remarkable\nanisotropic scattering angular distributions, as well as zero forward or\nbackward scattered intensities, which until recently was theoretically\ndemonstrated only for hypothetically postulated magnetodielectric spheres.\nAlso, interesting new effects of the optical forces exerted on these objects\nare now obtained.\n", "  The Baire metric induces an ultrametric on a dataset and is of linear\ncomputational complexity, contrasted with the standard quadratic time\nagglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. We apply the Baire distance to\nspectrometric and photometric redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nusing, in this work, about half a million astronomical objects. We want to know\nhow well the (more cos\\ tly to determine) spectrometric redshifts can predict\nthe (more easily obtained) photometric redshifts, i.e. we seek to regress the\nspectrometric on the photometric redshifts, and we develop a clusterwise\nnearest neighbor regression procedure for this.\n", "  We discuss the analogy between topological entanglement and quantum\nentanglement, particularly for tripartite quantum systems. We illustrate our\napproach by first discussing two clearly (topologically) inequivalent systems\nof three-ring links: The Borromean rings, in which the removal of any one link\nleaves the remaining two non-linked (or, by analogy, non-entangled); and an\ninequivalent system (which we call the NUS link) for which the removal of any\none link leaves the remaining two linked (or, entangled in our analogy). We\nintroduce unitary representations for the appropriate Braid Group ($B_3$) which\nproduce the related quantum entangled systems. We finally remark that these two\nquantum systems, which clearly possess inequivalent entanglement properties,\nare locally unitarily equivalent.\n", "  Dust particles in orbit around a star drift toward the central star by the\nPoynting-Robertson effect and pile up by sublimation. We analytically derive\nthe pile-up magnitude, adopting a simple model for optical cross sections. As a\nresult, we find that the sublimation temperature of drifting dust particles\nplays the most important role in the pile-up rather than their optical property\ndoes. Dust particles with high sublimation temperature form a significant dust\nring, which could be found in the vicinity of the sun through in-situ\nspacecraft measurements. While the existence of such a ring in a debris disk\ncould not be identified in the spectral energy distribution (SED), the size of\na dust-free zone shapes the SED. Since we analytically obtain the location and\ntemperature of sublimation, these analytical formulae are useful to find such\nsublimation evidences.\n", "  For large baryochemical potential, strongly interacting matter might undergo\na first order phase transition at temperatures T ~ 100-200 MeV. Within standard\ncosmology, however, the chemical potential is assumed to be very small leading\nto a crossover. We discuss implications of a first order QCD transition at high\nchemical potential being consistent with current observations. In this\ncontribution we concentrate on effects on the gravitational wave spectrum.\nThere are other interesting cosmological signals as a modification of the power\nspectrum of dark matter, the production of stellar black holes, and the seeds\nfor the extragalactic magnetic fields which we briefly address also.\n", "  Extremal but non-supersymmetric charged black holes with SU(2)_L spin in IIB\nstring theory compactified to five dimensions on K^3 x S^1 are considered.\nThese have a near-horizon or NHEK region with an enhanced SL(2,R)_L conformal\nsymmetry. It is shown that the NHEK geometry has a second, inequivalent,\nasymptotically flat extension in which the radius of the S^1 becomes infinite\nbut the radius of the angular circles of SU(2)_L orbits approach a constant.\nThe asymptotic charges associated to the second solution identify it as a 5D\nD1-D5-Taub-NUT black string with certain nonzero worldvolume charge densities,\ntemperatures and chemical potentials. The dual of the NHEK geometry is then\nidentified as an IR limit of this wrapped brane configuration.\n", "  Our analysis of the experimental data related to nonphotochemical laser\ninduced nucleation in solutions leads to the inevitable conclusion that the\nphase transformation is initiated by particles that are metallic in nature.\nThis conclusion appears paradoxical because the final products are dielectric\ncrystals. We show that the experimental results are well accounted for by the\ntheory of electric field induced nucleation of metallic particles that are\nelongated in the direction of the field. However, new physical and chemical\ninsights are required to understand the structure of the metallic precursor\nparticles and the kinetics of subsequent dielectric crystallization.\n", "  In recent years many procedures have been proposed to check the anisotropy of\na dataset. We present a new simple procedure, based on a scale dependent\napproach, to detect anisotropy signatures in a given distribution with\nparticular attention to small dataset. The method provides a good\ndiscrimination power for both large and small datasets, even in presence of\nstrong contaminating isotropic background. We present some applications to\nsimulated datasets of events to investigate statistical features of the method\nand present and inspect its behavior under both the null or the alternative\nhypothesis.\n", "  I discuss the phase diagram for QCD in the baryon chemical potential and\ntemperature plane. I argue that there is a new phase of matter different from\nthe deconfined Quark Gluon Plasma: Quarkyonic Matter. Quarkyonic Matter is\nconfined and exists at densities parametrically large compared to the QCD\nscale, when the number of quark colors, $N_c$ is large. I motivate the\npossibility that Quarkyonic Matter is in an inhomogeneous phase, and is\nsurrounded by lines of phase transitions, making a Happy Island in the\n$\\mu_B$-T plane. I conjecture about the geography of Happy Island.\n", "  Let -\\Delta denote the Dirichlet Laplace operator on a bounded open set in\n\\mathbb{R}^d. We study the sum of the negative eigenvalues of the operator -h^2\n\\Delta - 1 in the semiclassical limit h \\to 0+. We give a new proof that yields\nnot only the first term of the asymptotic formula but also the second term\ninvolving the surface area of the boundary of the set. The proof is valid under\nweak smoothness assumptions on the boundary.\n", "  Experiments on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN represent our furthest\nexcursion yet along the energy frontier of particle physics. The goal of\nprobing physical processes at the TeV energy scale puts strict requirements on\nthe performance of accelerator and experiment, dictating the awe-inspiring\ndimensions of both. These notes, based on a set of five lectures given at the\n2010 Theoretical Advanced Studies Institute in Boulder, Colorado, not only\nreview the physics considered as part of the accelerator and experiment design,\nbut also introduce algorithms and tools used to interpret experimental results\nin terms of theoretical models. The search for new physics beyond the Standard\nModel presents many new challenges, a few of which are addressed in specific\nexamples.\n", "  We study the kinetics of chiral transitions in quark matter using a\nmicroscopic framework (Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model) and a phenomenological model\n(Ginzburg-Landau free energy). We focus on the coarsening dynamics subsequent\nto a quench from the massless quark phase to the massive quark phase. The\nmorphology of the ordering system is characterized by the scaling of the\norder-parameter correlation function. The domain growth process obeys the\nAllen-Cahn growth law, $L(t)\\sim t^{1/2}$. We also study the growth of bubbles\nof the stable massive phase from the metastable massless phase.\n", "  Engineering the electronic structure of organics through interface\nmanipulation, particularly the interface dipole and the barriers to charge\ncarrier injection, is of essential importance to improved organic devices. This\nrequires the meticulous fabrication of desired organic structures by precisely\ncontrolling the interactions between molecules. The well-known principles of\norganic coordination chemistry cannot be applied without proper consideration\nof extra molecular hybridization, charge transer and dipole formation at the\ninterfaces. Here we identify the interplay between energy level alignment,\ncharge transfer, surface dipole and charge pillow effect and show how these\neffects collectively determine the net force between adsorbed porphyrin 2H-TPP\non Cu(111). We show that the forces between supported porphyrins can be altered\nby controlling the amount of charge transferred across the interface accurately\nthrough the relative alignment of molecular electronic levels with respect to\nthe Shockley surface state of the metal substrate, and hence govern the\nself-assembly of the molecules.\n", "  Protein folding cooperativity is defined by the nature of the finite-size\nthermodynamic transition exhibited upon folding: two-state transitions show a\nfree energy barrier between the folded and unfolded ensembles, while downhill\nfolding is barrierless. A microcanonical analysis, where the energy is the\nnatural variable, has shown better suited to unambiguously characterize the\nnature of the transition compared to its canonical counterpart. Replica\nexchange molecular dynamics simulations of a high resolution coarse-grained\nmodel allow for the accurate evaluation of the density of states, in order to\nextract precise thermodynamic information, and measure its impact on structural\nfeatures. The method is applied to three helical peptides: a short helix shows\nsharp features of a two-state folder, while a longer helix and a three-helix\nbundle exhibit downhill and two-state transitions, respectively. Extending the\nresults of lattice simulations and theoretical models, we find that it is the\ninterplay between secondary structure and the loss of non-native tertiary\ncontacts which determines the nature of the transition.\n", "  We prove a Beale-Kato-Majda type criterion for the loss of regularity for\nsolutions of the incompressible Euler equations in $H^{s}({\\mathbb R}^3)$, for\n$s>\\frac52$. Instead of double exponential estimates of Beale-Kato-Majda type,\nwe obtain a single exponential bound on $\\|u(t)\\|_{H^s}$ involving the length\nparameter introduced by P. Constantin in \\cite{co1}. In particular, we derive\nlower bounds on the blowup rate of such solutions.\n", "  We discuss the recently observed `excesses' in cosmic ray electron and\npositron fluxes which have been widely interpreted as signals of dark matter.\nBy considering the production and acceleration of secondary electrons and\npositrons in nearby supernova remnants, we predict an additional, harder\ncomponent that becomes dominant at high energies. The unknown spatial\ndistribution of the supernova remnants introduces a stochastic uncertainty\nwhich we estimate analytically. Fitting the prediction for different source\ndistributions to the total electron + positron flux measured by Fermi--LAT\nfixes all free parameters and allows us to `postdict' the rise in the positron\nfraction seen by PAMELA. A similar rise in the B/C ratio is predicted at high\nenergies.\n", "  Future linear colliders plan to collide polarised beams and the planned\nphysics reach requires knowledge of the state of polarisation as precisely as\npossible. The polarised beams can undergo depolarisation due to various\nmechanisms. In order to quantify the uncertainty due to depolarisation, spin\ntracking simulations in the International Linear Collider (ILC) Beam Delivery\nSystem (BDS) and at the Interaction Point (IP) have been performed. Spin\ntracking in the BDS was achieved using the BMAD subroutine library, and the\nCAIN program was used to do spin tracking through the beam-beam collision.\nAssuming initially aligned beamline elements in the BDS, a ground motion model\nwas applied to obtain realistic random misalignments over various time scales.\nDepolarisation at the level of 0.1% occurs within a day of ground motion at a\nnoisy site. Depolarisation at the IP also exceeds 0.1% for the nominal\nparameter sets for both the ILC and for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC).\nTheoretical work is underway to include radiative corrections in the\ndepolarisation processes and simulation of the depolarisation through the\nentire collider is envisaged.\n", "  Pseudoscalar-photon interactions were proposed in the study of the relations\namong equivalence principles. The interaction of pseudoscalar axion with gluons\nwas proposed as a way to solve the strong CP problem. Subsequent proposal of\naxion as a dark matter candidate has been a focus of search. Motivation from\nsuperstring theories add to its importance. After a brief introduction and\nhistorical review, we present (i) the current status of our optical experiment\nusing high-finesse Fabry-Perot resonant cavity - Q & A experiment - to detect\npseudoscalar-photon interactions, (ii) the constraints on pseudoscalar-photon\ninteractions from astrophysical and cosmological observations on cosmic\npolarization rotation, and (iii) theoretical models of non-minimal interactions\nof gravitational, electromagnetic and pseudoscalar (axion) fields, and their\nrelevance to cosmology.\n", "  We deal with phantom energy accretion onto the Schwarzschild de-Sitter black\nhole. The energy flux conservation, relativistic Bernoulli equation and mass\nflux conservation equation are formulated to discuss the phantom accretion. We\ndiscuss the conditions for critical accretion. It is found that mass of the\nblack hole decreases due to phantom accretion. There exist two critical points\nwhich lie in the exterior of horizons (black hole and cosmological horizons).\nThe results for the phantom energy accretion onto the Schwarzschild black hole\ncan be recovered by taking $\\Lambda\\rightarrow0$.\n", "  Highly excited states of rubidium (Rb) atoms attached to helium (He)\nnanodroplets are studied by two-photon ionization spectroscopy in combination\nwith electron and ion imaging. Photoion spectra and angular distributions are\nin good agreement with a pseudodiatomic model for the RbHe_N complex. Repulsive\ninteractions in the excited states entail fast dissociation followed by\nionization of free Rb atoms as well as of RbHe and RbHe_2 exciplexes.\nNonresonant excitation generates Rb atoms in low-lying electronic levels by\nstatistical evaporation-like desorption.\n", "  Recent data reported by the PAMELA and ATIC experiments, as well as cosmic\nray lepton results from FERMI and H.E.S.S. collaborations sparked a series of\npapers explaining these results either by contributions of electron positron\npairs to the local interstellar cosmic ray (CR) spectrum by dark matter (DM) or\npulsars. Focusing here on pulsars, we argue that at the present, our knowledge\nabout particle acceleration at pulsars as well as of the local Galactic CR\npropagation is still limited, i.e. the recent results for CR electrons and\npositrons constrain pulsar and propagation models. We will thus not present\nanother attempt to explain the data by contributions of pulsars to the local CR\nlepton flux but rather to highlight the caveats in doing so.\n", "  By simulating the first order globule-crystal transition of a flexible\nhomopolymer chain, both by collision dynamics and Monte Carlo with non-kinetic\nmoves, we show that the effective and the thermodynamic transition temperatures\nare different and we propose a way of quantifying the kinetic hindering. We\nthen also observe that the top eigenvalue in the spectrum of the dynamical\n(contact or adjacency) matrix provides insight into the ensembles of folding\nand unfolding trajectories, and may be a suitable additional reaction\ncoordinate for the folding transition of chain molecules.\n", "  Binary systems can be powerful sources of non-thermal emission from radio to\ngamma rays. When the latter are detected, then these objects are known as\ngamma-ray binaries. In this work, we explore, in the context of gamma-ray\nbinaries, different acceleration processes to estimate their efficiency: Fermi\nI, Fermi II, shear acceleration, the converter mechanism, and magnetic\nreconnection. We find that Fermi I acceleration in a mildly relativistic shock\ncan provide, although marginally, the multi-10 TeV particles required to\nexplain observations. Shear acceleration may be a complementary mechanism,\ngiving particles the final boost to reach such a high energies. Fermi II\nacceleration may be too slow to account for the observed very high energy\nphotons, but may be suitable to explain extended low-energy emission. The\nconverter mechanism seems to require rather high Lorentz factors but cannot be\ndiscarded a priori. Standard relativistic shock acceleration requires a highly\nturbulent, weakly magnetized downstream medium; magnetic reconnection, by\nitself possibly insufficient to reach very high energies, could perhaps\nfacilitate such a conditions. Further theoretical developments, and a better\nsource characterization, are needed to pinpoint the dominant acceleration\nmechanism, which need not be one and the same in all sources.\n", "  In these lecture notes we review some recent attempts at searching for\nnon-Fermi liquids and novel quantum phase transitions in holographic systems\nusing gauge/gravity duality. We do this by studying the simplest finite density\nsystem arising from the duality, obtained by turning on a nonzero chemical\npotential for a U(1) global symmetry of a CFT, and described on the gravity\nside by a charged black hole. We address the following questions of such a\nfinite density system:\n  1. Does the system have a Fermi surface? What are the properties of low\nenergy excitations near the Fermi surface?\n  2. Does the system have an instability to condensation of scalar operators?\nWhat is the critical behavior near the corresponding quantum critical point?\n  We find interesting parallels with those of high T_c cuprates and heavy\nelectron systems. Playing a crucial role in our discussion is a universal\nintermediate-energy phase, called a \"semi-local quantum liquid\", which\nunderlies the non-Fermi liquid and novel quantum critical behavior of a system.\nIt also provides a novel mechanism for the emergence of lower energy states\nsuch as a Fermi liquid or a superconductor.\n", "  Two efficient and isotope-selective resonant two-photon ionization techniques\nfor loading barium ions into radio-frequency (RF)-traps are demonstrated. The\nscheme of using a strong dipole-allowed transition at \\lambda=553 nm as a first\nstep towards ionization is compared to the established technique of using a\nweak intercombination line (\\lambda=413 nm). An increase of two orders of\nmagnitude in the ionization efficiency is found favoring the transition at 553\nnm. This technique can be implemented using commercial all-solid-state laser\nsystems and is expected to be advantageous compared to other narrowband\nphotoionization schemes of barium in cases where highest efficiency and\nisotope-selectivity are required.\n", "  After the PAMELA finding of an increasing positron fraction above 10 GeV, the\nexperimental evidence for the presence of a new electron and positron spectral\ncomponent in the cosmic ray zoo has been recently confirmed by Fermi-LAT. We\nshow that a simple phenomenological model which assumes the presence of a\nprimary electron and positron extra component allows a consistent description\nof all available data sets. We then describe the most relevant astrophysical\nuncertainties which still prevent to determine the electron+positron source\nproperties from those data and the perspectives of forthcoming experiments.\n", "  The VERITAS telescope array has been operating smoothly since 2007, and has\ndetected gamma-ray emission above 100 GeV from 40 astrophysical sources. These\ninclude blazars, pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants, gamma-ray binary\nsystems, a starburst galaxy, a radio galaxy, the Crab pulsar, and gamma-ray\nsources whose origin remains unidentified. In 2009, the array was reconfigured,\ngreatly improving the sensitivity. We summarize the current status of the\nobservatory, describe some of the scientific highlights since 2009, and outline\nplans for the future.\n", "  In this review, I discuss briefly theoretical scenarios concerning the\ninterpretation of recent results from indirect and direct dark matter searches,\nwith emphasis on the former.\n", "  The assessment of the reliability of Monte Carlo simulations is discussed,\nwith emphasis on uncertainty quantification and the related impact on\nexperimental results. Methods and techniques to account for epistemic\nuncertainties, i.e. for intrinsic knowledge gaps in physics modeling, are\ndiscussed with the support of applications to concrete experimental scenarios.\nOngoing projects regarding the investigation of epistemic uncertainties in the\nGeant4 simulation toolkit are reported.\n", "  To explain the appearance of heterogeneities in the plasma membrane, I\npropose a hypothesis which begins with the observation that fluctuations in the\nmembrane curvature are coupled to the difference between compositions in one\nleaf and the other. Because of this coupling, the most easily excited\nfluctuations can occur at non-zero wavenumbers. When the coupling is\nsufficiently strong, it is well-known that it leads to microphase separation\nand modulated phases. I note that when the coupling is less strong, the\ntendency towards modulation remains manifest in a liquid phase that exhibits\ntransient structure of a characteristic size; that is, it is a microemulsion.\nThe characteristic size of the fluctuating domains is estimated to be on the\norder of 100 nm, and experiments to verify this hypothesis are proposed.\n", "  Direct searches for dark matter lead to serious problems for simple models\nwith stable neutral Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) as candidates\nfor dark matter. A possibility is discussed that new stable quarks and charged\nleptons exist and are hidden from detection, being bound in neutral dark atoms\nof composite dark matter. Stable -2 charged particles $O^{--}$ are bound with\nprimordial helium in O-helium (OHe) atoms, being specific nuclear interacting\nform of composite dark matter. The positive results of DAMA experiments can be\nexplained as annual modulation of radiative capture of O-helium by nuclei. In\nthe framework of this approach test of DAMA results in detectors with other\nchemical content becomes a nontrivial task, while the experimental search of\nstable charged particles at LHC or in cosmic rays acquires a meaning of direct\ntest for composite dark matter scenario.\n", "  In the past few years, gamma-ray astronomy has entered a golden age. At TeV\nenergies, only a handful of sources were known a decade ago, but the current\ngeneration of ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes has\nincreased this number to more than one hundred. At GeV energies, the Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope has increased the number of known sources by nearly\nan order of magnitude in its first 2 years of operation. The recent detection\nand unprecedented morphological studies of gamma-ray emission from shell-type\nsupernova remnants is of great interest, as these analyses are directly linked\nto the long standing issue of the origin of the cosmic-rays. However, these\ndetections still do not constitute a conclusive proof that supernova remnants\naccelerate the bulk of Galactic cosmic-rays, mainly due to the difficulty of\ndisentangling the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the observed gamma-ray\nemission. In this talk, I will review the most relevant cosmic ray related\nresults of gamma ray astronomy concerning supernova remnants.\n", "  We compute boundary three-point functions involving two scalars and a gauge\nfield of arbitrary spin in the AdS vacuum of Vasiliev's higher spin gravity,\nfor any deformation parameter \\lambda. In the process, we develop tools for\nextracting scalar field equations in arbitrary higher spin backgrounds. We work\nin the context of hs[\\lambda] + hs[\\lambda] Chern-Simons theory coupled to\nscalar fields, and make efficient use of the associative lone-star product\nunderlying the hs[\\lambda] algebra. Our results for the correlators precisely\nmatch expectations from CFT; in particular they match those of any CFT with\nW_{\\infinity}[\\lambda] symmetry at large central charge, and with primary\noperators dual to the scalar fields. As this is expected to include the `t\nHooft limit of the W_N minimal model CFT, our results serve as further evidence\nof the conjectured AdS/CFT duality between these two theories.\n", "  The treatment of the electron-nucleus interaction based on the Mott\ndifferential cross section was extended to account for effects due to screened\nCoulomb potentials, finite sizes and finite rest masses of nuclei for electrons\nabove 200 keV and up to ultra high energies. This treatment allows one to\ndetermine both the total and differential cross sections, thus, subsequently to\ncalculate the resulting nuclear and non-ionizing stopping powers. Above a few\nhundreds of MeV, neglecting the effect due to finite rest masses of recoil\nnuclei the stopping power and NIEL result to be largely underestimated; while,\nabove a few tens of MeV the finite size of the nuclear target prevents a\nfurther large increase of stopping powers which approach almost constant\nvalues.\n", "  A relativistic theory for neutrino superluminality is presented (in\nprinciple, the same mechanism applies also to other fermions). The theory\ninvolves the standard-model particles and one additional heavy sterile neutrino\nwith an energy-scale close to or above the electroweak one, all particles\npropagating in the usual 3+1 spacetime dimensions. Lorentz violation results\nfrom spontaneous symmetry breaking in the sterile-neutrino sector. The theory\ntries, as far as possible, to be consistent with the existing experimental data\nfrom neutrino physics and to keep the number of assumptions minimal. There are\nclear experimental predictions which can be tested.\n", "  The precise role of the microenvironment on tumor growth is poorly\nunderstood. Whereas the tumor is in constant competition with the surrounding\ntissue, little is known about the mechanics of this interaction. Using a novel\nexperimental procedure, we study quantitatively the effect of an applied\nmechanical stress on the long-term growth of a spheroid cell aggregate. We\nobserve that a stress of 10 kPa is sufficient to drastically reduce growth by\ninhibition of cell proliferation mainly in the core of the spheroid. We compare\nthe results to a simple numerical model developed to describe the role of\nmechanics in cancer progression.\n", "  We derive the defocusing cubic Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) hierarchy in dimension\n$d=3$, from an $N$-body Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation describing a gas of\ninteracting bosons in the GP scaling, in the limit $N\\rightarrow\\infty$. The\nmain result of this paper is the proof of convergence of the corresponding\nBBGKY hierarchy to a GP hierarchy in the spaces introduced in our previous work\non the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for GP hierarchies,\n\\cite{chpa2,chpa3,chpa4}, which are inspired by the solutions spaces based on\nspace-time norms introduced by Klainerman and Machedon in \\cite{klma}. We note\nthat in $d=3$, this has been a well-known open problem in the field. While our\nresults do not assume factorization of the solutions, consideration of\nfactorized solutions yields a new derivation of the cubic, defocusing nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation (NLS) in $d=3$.\n", "  Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) represent a promising alternative to\nclassical photomultipliers, for instance, for the detection of photons in high\nenergy physics and medical physics. In the present work, electrical\ncharacterizations of test devices - manufactured by ST Microelectronics - are\npresented. SiPMs with an area of 3.5x3.5 micron^2 and a cell pitch of 54 micron\nwere manufactured as arrays of 64x64 cells and exhibiting a fill factor of 31%.\nThe capacitance of SiPMs was measured as a function of reverse bias voltage at\nfrequencies ranging from from 20 Hz up to 1 MHz and temperatures from 300 K\ndown to 85 K. While leakage currents were measured at temperatures from 400 K\ndown to 85 K. Thus, the threshold voltage - i.e., voltage corresponding to that\nat which the multiplication regime for the leakage current begins - could be\ndetermined as a function of temperature. Finally, an electrical model suited to\nreproduce the dependence of the frequency dependence of capacitance is\npresented.\n", "  We derive a set of first-order differential equations obeyed by the S-matrix\nof planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The equations, based on\nthe Yangian symmetry of the theory, involve only finite and\nregulator-independent quantities and uniquely determine the all-loop S-matrix.\nWhen expanded in powers of the coupling they give derivatives of amplitudes as\nsingle integrals over lower-loop, higher-point amplitudes/Wilson loops. We\noutline a derivation for the equations using the Operator Product Expansion for\nWilson loops. We apply them on a few examples at two- and three-loops,\nreproducing a recent result on the two-loop NMHV hexagon and fixing previously\nundermined coefficients in a recent Ansatz for the three-loop MHV hexagon. In\naddition, we consider amplitudes restricted to a two-dimensional subspace of\nMinkowski space and derive a particularly simple set of partially closed\nequations in that case.\n", "  We present a new formulation of the local c-map, which makes use of the real\nformulation of special Kahler geometry and the associated Hesse potential. As\nan application we use the temporal version of the c-map to derive the black\nhole attractor equations from geometric properties of the scalar manifold, and\nwe construct various stationary solutions for four-dimensional vector\nmultiplets by lifting instanton solutions of the time-reduced theory.\n", "  We report on the characterization of candidate light sensors for use in the\nnext-generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope project called\nCherenkov Telescope Array, a major astro-particle physics project of about 100\ntelescopes that is currently in the prototyping phase. Our goal is to develop\nwith the manufacturers the best possible light sensors (highest photon\ndetection efficiency, lowest crosstalk and afterpulsing). The cameras of those\ntelescopes will be based on classical super-bi-alkali Photomultiplier tubes but\nalso Silicon Photomultipliers are candidate light sensors. A full\ncharacterisation of selected sensors was done. We are working in close contact\nwith several manufacturers, giving them feedback and suggesting improvements.\n", "  The LHC is well on track toward the discovery or exclusion of a light\nStandard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson. Such a Higgs has a very small SM width\nand can easily have large branching fractions to physics beyond the SM, making\nHiggs decays an excellent opportunity to observe new physics. Decays into\ncollider-invisible particles are particularly interesting as they are\ntheoretically well motivated and relatively clean experimentally. In this work\nwe estimate the potential of the 7 and 8 TeV LHC to observe an invisible Higgs\nbranching fraction. We analyze three channels that can be used to directly\nstudy the invisible Higgs branching ratio at the 7 TeV LHC: an invisible Higgs\nproduced in association with (i) a hard jet; (ii) a leptonic Z; and (iii)\nforward tagging jets. We find that the last channel, where the Higgs is\nproduced via weak boson fusion, is the most sensitive, allowing branching\nfractions as small as 40% to be probed at 20 inverse fb for masses in the range\nbetween 120 and 170 GeV, including in particular the interesting region around\n125 GeV. We provide an estimate of the 8 TeV LHC sensitivity to an\ninvisibly-decaying Higgs produced via weak boson fusion and find that the reach\nis comparable to but not better than the reach at the 7 TeV LHC. We further\nestimate the discovery potential at the 8 TeV LHC for cases where the Higgs has\nsubstantial branching fractions to both visible and invisible final states.\n", "  The differential intensities of Cosmic Rays at Earth were calculated using a\n2D stochastic Montecarlo diffusion code and compared with observation data. We\nevaluated the effect of stretched and compressed heliospheres on the Cosmic Ray\nintensities at the Earth. This was studied introducing a dependence of the\ndiffusion parameter on the heliospherical size. Then, we found that the optimum\nvalue of the heliospherical radius better accounting for experimental data. We\nalso found that the obtained values depends on solar activity. Our results are\ncompatible with Voyager observations and with models of heliospherical size\nmodulation.\n", "  A simple model is constructed to describe dissociation of charge transfer\nexcitons in bulk heterojunction solar cells, and its dependence on the physical\nparameters of the system. In bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPVs),\nexciton dissociation occurs almost exclusively at the interface between the\ndonor and acceptor, following one-electron initial excitation from the HOMO to\nthe LUMO levels of the donor, and charge transfer to the acceptor to make a\ncharge-transfer exciton. After exciton breakup, and neglecting the trapping of\nindividual carriers, the electron may undergo two processes for decay: one\nprocess involves the electron and/or hole leaving the interface, and migrating\nto the electrode. This is treated here as the electron moving on a set of\nacceptor sites. The second loss process is radiationless decay following\nrecombination of the acceptor electron with the donor cation; this is treated\nby adding a relaxation term. These two processes compete with one another. We\nmodel both the exciton breakup and the subsequent electron motion. Results\ndepend on tunneling amplitude, energetics, disorder, Coulomb barriers, and\nenergy level matchups, particularly the so-called LUMO/LUMO offset.\n", "  Five elementary lectures delivered at TASI 2011 on the Standard Model, its\nextensions to neutrino masses, flavor symmetries, and Grand-Unification.\n", "  One of the remarkable notions in the recent development of quantum physics is\nthe weak value related to weak measurements. We emulate it as a two-time\nconditional expectation in a classical stochastic model. We use the well known\nsymmetrized form of the master equation, which is formally equivalent to the\nwave equation in quantum mechanics apart from the fact that wave functions are\nalways real. The origin of the unusual behaviors of the weak value such as the\nnegative probability and the abnormal enhancement of some expectations becomes\nclearer in the present case, where the two-time conditional probability has no\nambiguity of imaginary/complex values.\n", "  One of the most relevant manifestations of the\nBeresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition occurs in quasi-two-dimensional\nsuperconducting systems. The experimental advances made in the last decade in\nthe investigation of superconducting phenomena in low-dimensional correlated\nelectronic systems raised new questions on the nature of the BKT transitions in\nreal materials. A general issue concerns the possible limitations of\ntheoretical predictions based on the XY model, that was studied as a\nparadigmatic example in the original formulation. Here we review the work we\nhave done in revisiting the nature of the BKT transition within the general\nframework provided by the mapping into the sine-Gordon model. While this\nmapping was already known since long, we recently emphasized the advantages on\nsuch an approach to account for new variables in the BKT physics. One such\nvariable is the energy needed to create the core of the vortex, that is fixed\nwithin the XY model, while it attains substantially different values in real\nmaterials. This has interesting observable consequences, especially in the case\nwhen additional relevant perturbations are present, as a coupling between\nstacked two-dimensional superconducting layers or a finite magnetic field.\n", "  The dynamics following the photoexcitation of Na and Li atoms located on the\nsurface of helium nanodroplets has been investigated in a joint experimental\nand theoretical study. Photoelectron spectroscopy has revealed that excitation\nof the alkali atoms via the (n+1) -> ns transition leads to the desorption of\nthese atoms. The mean kinetic energy of the desorbed atoms, as determined by\nion imaging, shows a linear dependence on excitation frequency. These\nexperimental findings are analyzed within a three-dimensional, time-dependent\ndensity functional approach for the helium droplet combined with a Bohmian\ndynamics description of the desorbing atom. This hybrid method reproduces well\nthe key experimental observables. The dependence of the observables on the\nimpurity mass is discussed by comparing the results obtained for the 6Li and\n7Li isotopes. The calculations show that the desorption of the excited alkali\natom is accompanied by the creation of highly non-linear density waves in the\nhelium droplet that propagate at supersonic velocities.\n", "  The application and extension of well-known BRST cohomological methods to\nsupersymmetric field theories are discussed. The focus is on the emergence and\nparticular features of supersymmetry algebra cohomology in this context. In\nparticular it is discussed and demonstrated that supersymmetry algebra\ncohomology emerges within the cohomological analysis of standard supersymmetric\nfield theories whether or not the commutator algebra of the symmetry\ntransformations closes off-shell.\n", "  Current surveys of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) find only a very small\nfraction of AGN contributing to the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) at energies\nabove 15 keV. Roughly 99% of the CXB is so far unresolved. In this work we\naddress the question of the unresolved component of the CXB with the combined\nsurveys of INTEGRAL and Swift. These two currently flying X-ray missions\nperform independent surveys at energies above 15 keV. Our approach is to\nperform the independent surveys and merge them in order to enhance the exposure\ntime and reduce the systematic uncertainties. We do this with resampling\ntechniques. As a result we obtain a new survey over a wide sky area of 6200\ndeg2 that is a factor ~4 more sensitive than the survey of Swift or INTEGRAL\nalone. Our sample comprises more than 100 AGN. We use the extragalactic source\nsample to resolve the CXB by more than a factor 2 compared to current parent\nsurveys.\n", "  This paper describes a set of discrete R symmetries which can be used to\ndefine the minimal supersymmetric standard model or singlet extensions of it.\n", "  High-accuracy multicolor light curves of the binary system HD 189733, which\ncontains an exoplanet, are analyzed. We have determined the radii of the star\nand the planet in the binary system, as well as the orbital inclination. The\nlimb-darkening coefficients of the stellar disk were obtained in 10 filters in\nthe wavelength interval 5500-10500 AA. The uncertainties of the fitted\nparameters were estimated using the differential-correction and confidence-area\nmethods. The wavelength dependence of the limb-darkening coefficients is\ncompared to the corresponding theoretical function for a model thin stellar\natmosphere. We confirm the wavelength dependence of the exoplanet's radius\nfound by Pont et al. The exoplanet radius increases with decreasing wavelength,\nwhich seems to argue for the presence of an atmosphere around the planet.\n", "  Based on results obtained with event generators we have launched the\ncore-corona model. It describes in a simplified way but quite successfully the\ncentrality dependence of multiplicity and $<p_t>$ of identified particles\nobserved in heavy-ion reaction at beam energies between $\\sqrt{s}$ = 17 GeV and\n200 GeV. Also the centrality dependence of the elliptic flow, $v_2$, for all\ncharged and identified particles could be explained in this model. Here we\nextend this analysis and study the centrality dependence of single particle\nspectra of $K^-$ and ${\\bar p}$ measured by the PHENIX, STAR and BRAHMS\ncollaborations. We find that also for these particles the analysis of the\nspectra in the core-corona model suffers from differences in the data published\nby the different experimental groups, notably for the pp collisions. As for\nprotons and $K^+$ for each experience the data agree well with the prediction\nof the core-corona model but the value of the two necessary parameters depends\non the experiments. We show as well that the average momentum as a function of\nthe centrality depends in a very sensitive way on the particle species and may\nbe quite different for particles which have about the same mass. Therefore the\nidea to interpret this centrality dependence as a consequence of a collective\nexpansion of the system, as done in blast way fits may be premature.\n", "  Solutions of LiCl and of NaCl in ultrapure water were studied through\nRayleigh/Brillouin scattering as a function of the concentration (molarity, M)\nof dissolved salt from 0.2M to extremely low concentration (2.10^-17 M ). The\nLandau-Placzek ratio, R/B, of the Rayleigh scattering intensity over the total\nBrillouin, was measured thanks to the dynamically controlled stability of the\nused Fabry-Perot interferometer. It was observed that the R/B ratio follows two\nstages as a function of increasing dilution rate: after a strong decrease\nbetween 0.2M and 2.10^-5 M, it increases to reach a maximum between 10^-9 M and\n10^-16 M. The first stage corresponds to the decrease of the Rayleigh\nscattering by the ion concentration fluctuations with the decrease of salt\nconcentration. The second stage, at lower concentrations, is consistent with\nthe increase of the Rayleigh scattering by long-lived sub-microscopic bubbles\nwith the decrease of ion concentration. The origin of these sub-microscopic\nbubbles is the shaking of the solutions which was carried out after each\ncentesimal dilution. The very long lifetime of the sub-microscopic bubbles and\nthe effects of aging originate in the electric charge of bubbles. The increase\nof R/B with the decrease of the low salt concentration corresponds to the\nincrease of the sub-microscopic bubble size with the decrease of concentration,\nthat is imposed by the bubble stability due to the covering of the surface\nbubble by negative ions.\n", "  Using factorizable Hopf algebras, we construct modular invariant partition\nfunctions of charge conjugation, or Cardy, type as characters of coends in\ncategories that share essential features with the ones appearing in logarithmic\nCFT. The coefficients of such a partition function are given by the Cartan\nmatrix of the theory.\n", "  We report on some old and new results on the quantum aspects of\nfour-dimensional maximal supergravity, and its hypothetical ultraviolet\nfiniteness.\n", "  The superposition of chiral states of chiral molecules, as delocalized\nquantum states of a many-particle system, can be used for the experimental\ninvestigations of decoherence theory. In this regard, a great challenge is the\nprecise quantification of the robustness of these superpositions against\nenvironmental effects. The methods so far proposed need the detailed\nspecification of the internal states of the molecule, usually requiring heavy\nnumerical calculations. Here, by using the linearized quantum Boltzmann\nequation and by borrowing ideas employed for analyzing other quantum systems,\nwe present a general and simple approach, of large applicability, which can be\nused to compute the dominant contribution to the decoherence rate for the\nsuperpositions of chiral states of chiral molecules, due to environmental\nscattering.\n", "  This article is based on a talk given at the Memorial Conference for\nMaximilian Kreuzer at the ESI in Vienna and contains a compact summary of a\nrecent collaboration with P.A. Grassi. A non-linear projection from the space\nof SO(10) Weyl spinors to the space of pure spinors is presented together with\nsome of its particular properties. This projection can be used to remove the\nconstraints from Berkovits' pure spinor superstring while introducing\nadditional gauge symmetries. This should allow to make transitions to\nequivalent formulations which might shed light on the origin of the pure spinor\nghosts. It might also be useful in the context of path integral measures for\nthe pure spinor string.\n", "  To achieve the extremely high luminosity for colliding electron-positron\nbeams at the future International Linear Collider (ILC) an undulator-based\nsource with about 230 meters helical undulator and a thin titanium-alloy target\nrim rotated with tangential velocity of about 100 meters per second are\nforeseen. The very high density of heat deposited in the target has to be\nanalyzed carefully. The energy deposited by the photon beam in the target has\nbeen calculated in FLUKA. The resulting stress in the target material after one\nbunch train has been simulated in ANSYS.\n", "  We review the fundamental properties of the quantum relative entropy for\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In particular, we focus on several\ninequalities that are related to the second law of thermodynamics, where the\npositivity and the monotonicity of the quantum relative entropy play key roles;\nthese properties are directly applicable to derivations of the second law\n(e.g., the Clausius inequality). Moreover, the positivity is closely related to\nthe quantum fluctuation theorem, while the monotonicity leads to a quantum\nversion of the Hatano-Sasa inequality for nonequilibrium steady states. Based\non the monotonicity, we also discuss the data processing inequality for the\nquantum mutual information, which has a similar mathematical structure to that\nof the second law. Moreover, we derive a generalized second law with quantum\nfeedback control. In addition, we review a proof of the monotonicity in line\nwith Petz.\n", "  AstroFit is an interface adding astrophysical components to programs for\nfitting physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) to experimental data from\ncollider searches. The project aims at combining a wide range of experimental\nresults from indirect, direct and collider serarches for Dark Matter (DM) and\nconfronting it with theoretical expectations in various DM models. Here, we\nintroduce AstroFit and discuss first results.\n", "  The yrast states of even even vibrational and transitional nuclei are inter-\npreted as a rotating condensate of interacting d-bosons and the corresponding\nsemi-classical tidal wave concept. A simple experimental manifestation of the\nanharmonicity caused by the boson interaction is found. The interpretation is\nsubstantiated by calculations based on the Collective Model and the Cranking\nModel.\n", "  We present a differential rate equation model of chiral polymerization based\non a simple copolymerization scheme in which the enantiomers are added to, or\nremoved from, the homochiral or heterochiral chains (reversible stepwise\nisodesmic growth or dissociation). The model is set up for closed systems and\ntakes into account the corresponding thermodynamic constraints implied by the\nreversible monomer attachments, while obeying a constant mass constraint. In\nits simplest form, the model depends on a single variable rate constant, the\nmaximum chain length N, and the initial concentrations. We have fit the model\nto the experimental data from the Rehovot group on lattice-controlled chiral\namplification of oligopeptides. We find in all the chemical systems employed\nexcept for one, that the model fits the measured relative abundances of the\noligopetides with higher degrees of correlation than from a purely random\npolymerization process.\n", "  In this paper, we study the fermionic excitations near the quantum\ncriticality using gauge/gravity duality. This is motivated by exploring the\nFermi surface evolution near the quantum criticality. We construct the gravity\ndual of \"paramagnetic-nematic\" phase transition in a continuum limit and study\nthe Fermi surface evolution across this quantum phase transition. We find that\nthere exists non-Fermi liquid with the Fermi surface in the \"paramagnetic\"\nphase and the Fermi surface disappears in the \"nematic\" phase.\n", "  We show that simultaneous gauge and supersymmetry breaking can be induced by\nradiative corrections, a la Coleman-Weinberg. When a certain correlation among\nthe superpotential parameters is present, a local supersymmetry-breaking\nminimum is found in the effective potential of a gauge non-singlet field, in a\nregion where the tree-level potential is almost flat. Supersymmetry breaking is\nthen transmitted to the MSSM through gauge and chiral messenger loops, thus\navoiding the suppression of gaugino masses characteristic of direct gauge\nmediation models. The use of a single field ensures that no dangerous tachyonic\nscalar masses are generated at the one-loop level. We illustrate this mechanism\nwith an explicit example based on an SU(5) model with a single adjoint. An\ninteresting feature of the scenario is that the GUT scale is increased with\nrespect to standard unification, thus allowing for a larger colour Higgs\ntriplet mass, as preferred by the experimental lower bound on the proton\nlifetime.\n", "  We analyze the 2011 LHC Higgs data in the context of simplified new physics\nmodels addressing the naturalness problem. These models are expected to contain\nnew particles with sizable couplings to the Higgs boson, which can easily\nmodify the Higgs production cross sections and branching fractions. We focus on\nsearches in the Higgs to 4 leptons and Higgs to diphoton channels, in the\nlatter case including the vector boson fusion production mode. Combining the\navailable ATLAS and CMS data in these channels, we derive constraints on an\neffective low-energy theory of the Higgs boson. We then map several simplified\nscenarios to the effective theory, capturing numerous natural new physics\nmodels such as supersymmetry and Little Higgs, and extract the constraints on\nthe corresponding parameter space. We show that simple models where one\nfermionic or one scalar partner is responsible for stabilizing the Higgs\npotential are already constrained in a non-trivial way by LHC Higgs data.\n", "  The hybrid NLIE of AdS_5 x S^5 is applied to a wider class of states. We find\nthat the Konishi state of the orbifold AdS_5 x (S^5/Z_S) satisfies A_1 NLIE\nwith the source terms which are derived from contour deformation trick. For\ngeneral states, we construct a deformed contour with which the contour\ndeformation trick yields the correct source terms.\n", "  We explore the equation of state (EoS) for dark energy $w_{\\mathrm{DE}}$ in\nmodified gravitational theories to explain the current accelerated expansion of\nthe universe. We explicitly demonstrate that the future crossings of the\nphantom divide line of $w_{\\mathrm{DE}}=-1$ are the generic feature in the\nexisting viable $f(R)$ gravity models. Furthermore, we show that the crossing\nof the phantom divide can be realized in the combined $f(T)$ theory constructed\nwith the exponential and logarithmic terms. In addition, we investigate the\neffective EoS for the universe when the finite-time future singularities occur\nin non-local gravity.\n", "  Quasi-static systems are an important concept in thermodynamics: they are\ndynamic but close enough to equilibrium that many properties of equilibrium\nsystems still hold. Slowly evolving horizons are the corresponding concept for\nquasilocally defined black holes: they are \"nearly isolated\" future outer\ntrapping horizons. This article reviews the definition and properties of these\nobjects including both their mechanics and the role that they play in the\nfluid-gravity correspondence. It also introduces a new property: there is an\nevent horizon candidate in close proximity to any slowly evolving horizon.\n", "  Based on Refs.1 and 2, we study the couplings of the scalar bound state to\nthe fermions and the weak bosons in walking gauge theories.\n", "  Quantum annealing method has been widely attracted attention in statistical\nphysics and information science since it is expected to be a powerful method to\nobtain the best solution of optimization problem as well as simulated\nannealing. The quantum annealing method was incubated in quantum statistical\nphysics. This is an alternative method of the simulated annealing which is\nwell-adopted for many optimization problems. In the simulated annealing, we\nobtain a solution of optimization problem by decreasing temperature (thermal\nfluctuation) gradually. In the quantum annealing, in contrast, we decrease\nquantum field (quantum fluctuation) gradually and obtain a solution. In this\npaper we review how to implement quantum annealing and show some quantum\nfluctuation effects in frustrated Ising spin systems.\n", "  The ILC baseline design for the positron source is based on radiation from a\nhelical undulator to produce positrons in a thin target. Since the photon beam\ncreated in the helical undulator is circularly polarized, the generated\npositron beam is longitudinally polarized. Using a photon collimator upstream\nthe positron target the positron polarization can be enhanced. However, the\nphoton beam intensity yields a huge thermal load in the collimator material. In\nthis paper the thermal load and heat dissipation in the photon collimator is\ndiscussed and design solutions are suggested.\n", "  An overview is given of theoretical progress on self-organization at the\nnanoscale in reactive systems of heterogeneous catalysis observed by field\nemission microscopy techniques and at the molecular scale in copolymerization\nprocesses. The results are presented in the perspective of recent advances in\nnonequilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, allowing us to\nunderstand how nanosystems driven away from equilibrium can manifest\ndirectionality and dynamical order.\n", "  In the present work, we have considered N-dimensional Einstein field\nequations in which 4-dimensional space-time is described by a FRW metric and\nthat of the extra d-dimensions by an Euclidean metric. Considering the universe\nfilled with tachyonic field we have reconstructed the potential $V(\\phi)$\ncorresponding to the field reconstructions in an anisotropic universe under\n\\emph{Emergent-Power law}, \\emph{Emergent-Intermediate},\n\\emph{Emergent-Logamediate}and \\emph{Logamediate-Intermediate} scenarios. The\nstatefinder parameters have been investigated in all of the said scenarios.\n", "  Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), are a leading candidate for the\ndark matter that is observed to constitute ~25% of the total mass-energy\ndensity of the Universe. The direct detection of relic WIMPs (those produced\nduring the early moments of the Universe's expansion) is at the forefront of\nactive research areas in particle astrophysics with a numerous international\nexperimental collaborations pursuing this goal. This paper presents an overview\nof the theoretical and practical considerations common to the design and\noperation of direct detection experiments, as well as their unique features and\ncapabilities.\n", "  We consider a two dimensional semiconductor with carriers subject to\nspin-orbit interactions and scattered by randomly distributed magnetic\nimpurities. We solve the time-dependent Schroedinger equation to investigate\nthe relationship between the geometrical properties of the wavefunction and the\nsystem's spin dependent transport properties. Even in the absence of localized\nstates, interference effects modify the carrier diffusion, as revealed by the\nappearance of power laws dependent on the impurity concentration. For stronger\ndisorder, we find a localization transition characterized by a fractal\nwavefunction and enhanced spin transport.\n", "  Future LHC luminosity upgrades will significantly increase the amount of\nbackground hits from photons, neutrons and protons in the detectors of the\nATLAS muon spectrometer. At the proposed LHC peak luminosity of 5*10^34\n1/cm^2s, background hit rates of more than 10 kHz/cm^2 are expected in the\ninnermost forward region, leading to a loss of performance of the current\ntracking chambers. Based on the ATLAS Monitored Drift Tube chambers, a new high\nrate capable drift tube detecor using tubes with a reduced diameter of 15mm was\ndeveloped. To test the response to highly ionizing particles, a prototype\nchamber of 46 15mm drift tubes was irradiated with a 20 MeV proton beam at the\ntandem accelerator at the Maier-Leibnitz Laboratory, Munich. Three tubes in a\nplanar layer were irradiated while all other tubes were used for reconstruction\nof cosmic muon tracks through irradiated and non-irradiated parts of the\nchamber. To determine the rate capability of the 15mm drift-tubes we\ninvestigated the effect of the proton hit rate on pulse height, efficiency and\nspatial resolution of the cosmic muon signals.\n", "  Velocity map imaging inside an electrostatic quadrupole guide is\ndemonstrated. By switching the voltages that are applied to the rods, the\nquadrupole can be used for guiding Stark decelerated molecules and for\nextracting the ions. The extraction field is homogeneous along the axis of the\nquadrupole while it defocuses the ions in the direction perpendicular to both\nthe axis of the quadrupole and the axis of the ion optics. To compensate for\nthis astigmatism, a series of planar electrodes with horizontal and vertical\nslits is used. A velocity resolution of 35 m/s is obtained. It is shown that\nsignal due to thermal background can be eliminated, resulting in the detection\nof slow molecules with an increased signal-to-noise ratio. As an illustration\nof the resolving power, we have used the velocity map imaging system to\ncharacterize the phase-space distribution of a Stark decelerated ammonia beam.\n", "  Biochemical reaction systems may be viewed as discrete event processes\ncharacterized by a number of states and state transitions. These systems may be\nmodeled as state transition systems with transitions representing individual\nreaction events. Since they often involve a large number of interactions, it\ncan be difficult to construct such a model for a system, and since the\nresulting state-level model can involve a huge number of states, model analysis\ncan be difficult or impossible. Here, we describe methods for the high-level\nspecification of a system using hypergraphs, for the automated generation of a\nstate-level model from a high-level model, and for the exact reduction of a\nstate-level model using information from the high-level model. Exact reduction\nis achieved through the automated application of symmetry reduction and\ninvariant manifold reduction techniques to the high-level model, allowing\npotentially significant reductions without the need to generate a full model.\nThe application of the method to biochemical reaction systems is illustrated by\nmodels describing a hypothetical ion-channel at several levels of complexity.\nThe method allows for the reduction of the otherwise intractable example models\nto a manageable size.\n", "  An UV-VIS polarization Lidar has been designed and specified for aerosols\nmonitoring in the troposphere, showing the ability to precisely address low\nparticle depolarization ratios, in the range of a few percents. Non-spherical\nparticle backscattering coefficients as low as 5 {\\times} 10-8 m-1.sr-1 have\nbeen measured and the particle depolarization ratio detection limit is 0.6 %.\nThis achievement is based on a well-designed detector with laser-specified\noptical components (polarizers, dichroic beamsplitters) summarized in a\nsynthetic detector transfer matrix. Hence, systematic biases are drastically\nminimized. The detector matrix being diagonal, robust polarization calibration\nhas been achieved under real atmospheric conditions. This UV-VIS polarization\ndetector measures particle depolarization ratios over two orders of magnitude,\nfrom 0.6 up to 40 %, which is new, especially in the UV where molecular\nscattering is strong. Hence, a calibrated UV polarization-resolved\ntime-altitude map is proposed for urban and free tropospheric aerosols up to 4\nkilometres altitude, which is also new. These sensitive and accurate UV-VIS\npolarization-resolved measurements enhance the spatial and time evolution of\nnon-spherical tropospheric particles, even in urban polluted areas. This study\nshows the capability of polarization-resolved laser UV-VIS spectroscopy to\nspecifically address the light backscattering by spherical and non-spherical\ntropospheric aerosols.\n", "  We study current-induced vibrational cooling, heating, and instability in a\ndonor-acceptor rectifying molecular junction using a full counting statistics\napproach. In our model, electron-hole pair excitations are coupled to a given\nmolecular vibrational mode which is either harmonic or highly anharmonic. This\nmode may be further coupled to a dissipative thermal environment. Adopting a\nmaster equation approach, we confirm the charge and heat exchange fluctuation\ntheorem in the steady-state limit, for both harmonic and anharmonic models.\nUsing simple analytical expressions, we calculate the charge current and\nseveral measures for the mode effective temperature. At low bias, we observe\nthe effect of bias-induced cooling of the vibrational mode. At higher bias, the\nmode effective temperature is higher than the environmental temperature, yet\nthe junction is stable. Beyond that, once the vibrational mode (bias-induced)\nexcitation rate overcomes its relaxation rate, instability occurs. We identify\nregimes of instability as a function of voltage bias and coupling to an\nadditional phononic thermal bath. Interestingly, we observe a reentrant\nbehavior where an unstable junction can properly behave at a high enough bias.\nThe mechanism for this behavior is discussed.\n", "  The quark sector of the Standard Model exhibits an approximate U(2)^3 flavour\nsymmetry. This symmetry, broken in specific directions dictated by minimality,\ncan explain the success of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa picture of flavour\nmixing and CP violation, confirmed by the data so far, while allowing for\nobservable deviations from it, as expected in most models of ElectroWeak\nSymmetry Breaking. Building on previous work in the specific context of\nsupersymmetry, we analyze the expected effects and we quantify the current\nbounds in a general Effective Field Theory framework. As a further relevant\nexample we then show how the U(2)^3 symmetry and its breaking can be\nimplemented in a generic composite Higgs model and we make a first analysis of\nits peculiar consequences. We also discuss how some partial extension of U(2)^3\nto the lepton sector can arise, both in general and in composite Higgs models.\nAn optimistic though conceivable interpretation of the considerations developed\nin this paper gives reasons to think that new physics searches in the flavour\nsector may be about to explore an interesting realm of phenomena.\n", "  We study the quark structure of the sigma meson through the decay of\n$D_1(2430)$ meson by constructing an effective Lagrangian for charmed mesons\ninteracting with light mesons based on the chiral symmetry and heavy quark\nsymmetry. Within the linear realization of the chiral symmetry, we include the\nP-wave charmed mesons ($D_1(2430)$, $D_0(2400)$) as the chiral partners of\n($D^\\ast$, $D$), and the light scalar mesons as the chiral partner of the\npseudoscalar mesons. In the light meson sector, both the $q\\bar{q}$ and\n$qq\\bar{q}\\bar{q}$ states are incorporated respecting their different U(1)$_A$\ntransformation properties. We predict the $D_1 \\to D\\pi\\pi$ decay width with\ntwo pions in the $I=0,\\,l=0$ channel, which can be tested in the future\nexperiment. We find that the width increases with the percentage of the\n$q\\bar{q}$ content in the sigma meson.\n", "  I review the phenomena associated with pairing in nuclear physics, most\nprominently the ubiquitous presence of odd-even mass differences and the\nproperties of the excitation spectra, very different for even-even and odd-A\nnuclei. There are also significant dynamical effects of pairing, visible in the\ninertias associated with nuclear rotation and large-amplitude shape\ndeformation.\n", "  Since the eta meson is a short-lived neutral particle, it is not possible to\ninvestigate its structure via classical methods of particle scattering. To\nlearn about its quark wave function, one studies those decay processes of this\nmeson in which a pair of photons is produced, where at least one of them is\nvirtual. The virtual photons have a non-zero mass and convert into\nlepton-antilepton pairs. Therefore, information about the quarks' spatial\ndistribution inside the meson can be extracted from the lepton-antilepton\ninvariant mass distributions by comparing the empirical results with QED\npredictions, which are based on the assumption that the meson is a point-like\nparticle. The deviation from the expected behavior in the leptonic mass\nspectrum exposes the inner structure of the meson. This deviation is\ncharacterized by a form factor. The corresponding data were collected for the\npd --> 3He eta reaction at a proton beam momentum of 1.69 GeV/c. The experiment\nwas performed using the WASA-at-COSY detector in November 2008. 525 +/- 26\nevents of the eta --> g e+ e- decay channel were reconstructed. The analysis\nchain led to the determination of the value of the slope parameter, bp, equal\nto (2.27 +/- 0.73stat. +/- 0.46sys.) GeV^{-2}, where the systematical\nuncertainty should be treated as an upper limit only. The estimation of the\ncharge radius of the eta meson has been made resulting with the value of <\nr(eta)^2 >^(1/2) = (0.68 +/- 0.02) fm.\n", "  The four-fermion gravitational interaction is induced by torsion, and gets\ndominating on the Planck scale. The regular, axial-axial part of this\ninteraction by itself does not stop the gravitational compression. However, the\nanomalous, vector-vector interaction results in a natural way both in big\nbounce and in inflation.\n", "  Observations of light isotopes in cosmic rays provide information on their\norigin and propagation in the Galaxy. Using the data collected by AMS-01 in the\nSTS- 91 space mission, we compare the measurements on 1H, 2H, 3He and 4He with\ncalculations for interstellar propagation and solar modulation. These data are\ndescribed well by a diffusive-reacceleration model with parameters that match\nthe B/C ratio data. Close comparisons are made within the astrophysical con-\nstraints provided by the B/C data and within the nuclear uncertainties arising\nfrom the production cross sections. Astrophysical uncertainties are expected to\nbe dramatically reduced by future data, but nuclear uncertainties may rep-\nresent a serious limitation of the model predictions. A diagnostic test for the\nreliability of the models is given by ratios such as 2H/3He, 6Li/7Li or\n10B/11B.\n", "  We study the Sommerfeld enhancement experienced by a scattering object that\ncouples to a tower of mediators. This can occur in, e.g., models of secluded\ndark matter when the mediator scale is generated naturally by hidden-sector\nconfinement. Specializing to the case of a confining CFT, we show that\noff-resonant values of the enhancement can be increased by ~ 20% for cases of\ninterest when (i) the (strongly-coupled) CFT admits a weakly-coupled dual\ndescription and (ii) the conformal symmetry holds up to the Planck scale.\nLarger enhancements are possible for lower UV scales due to an increase in the\ncoupling strength of the tower.\n", "  Studying loop corrections to inflationary perturbations, with particular\nemphasis on infrared factors, is important to understand the consistency of the\ninflationary theory, its predictivity and to establish the existence of the\nslow-roll eternal inflation phenomena and its recently found volume bound. In\nthis paper we prove that the zeta correlation function is time-independent at\none-loop level in single clock inflation. While many of the one-loop diagrams\nlead to a time-dependence when considered individually, the time-dependence\nbeautifully cancels out in the overall sum. We identify two subsets of diagrams\nthat cancel separately due to different physical reasons. The first\ncancellation is related to the change of the background cosmology due to the\nrenormalization of the stress tensor. It results in a cancellation between the\nnon-1PI diagrams and some of the diagrams made with quartic vertices. The\nsecond subset of diagrams that cancel is made up of cubic operators, plus the\nremaining quartic ones. We are able to write the sum of these diagrams as the\nintegral over a specific three-point function between two very short\nwavelengths and one very long one. We then apply the consistency condition for\nthis three-point function in the squeezed limit to show that the sum of these\ndiagrams cannot give rise to a time dependence. This second cancellation is\nthus a consequence of the fact that in single clock inflation the attractor\nnature of the solution implies that a long wavelength zeta perturbation is\nindistinguishable from a trivial rescaling of the background, and so results in\nno physical effect on short wavelength modes.\n", "  We study the response of a conserved current to external electromagnetic\nfields in a holographic system with boundaries using the recently proposed\nAdS/BCFT (boundary conformal field theory) framework. This, in particular,\nallows us to extract the Hall current, the Hall conductivity, plus some\npotentially novel transport coefficients, and relations among them. We also\nanalyze the action of SL(2,Z) duality in the gravity bulk, which acts\nnon-trivially on the conductivity of the BCFT. Finally we consider a type IIA\nstring theory embedding of our setup.\n", "  We add a gravitational background lattice to the simplest holographic model\nof matter at finite density and calculate the optical conductivity. With the\nlattice, the zero frequency delta function found in previous calculations\n(resulting from translation invariance) is broadened and the DC conductivity is\nfinite. The optical conductivity exhibits a Drude peak with a cross-over to\npower-law behavior at higher frequencies. Surprisingly, these results bear a\nstrong resemblance to the properties of some of the cuprates.\n", "  Two of my collaborations with Max Kreuzer involved classification problems\nrelated to string vacua. In 1992 we found all 10,839 classes of polynomials\nthat lead to Landau-Ginzburg models with c=9 (Klemm and Schimmrigk also did\nthis); 7,555 of them are related to Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. Later we found\nall 473,800,776 reflexive polytopes in four dimensions; these give rise to\nCalabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. The missing piece - toric\nconstructions that need not be hypersurfaces - are the reflexive Gorenstein\ncones introduced by Batyrev and Borisov. I explain what they are, how they\ndefine the data for Witten's gauged linear sigma model, and how one can modify\nour classification ideas to apply to them. I also present results on the first\nand possibly most interesting step, the classification of certain basic weights\nsystems, and discuss limitations to a complete classification.\n", "  We show how to generalize the classical duals found by Gabadadze {\\it et al}\nto a very large class of self-interacting theories. This enables one to adopt a\nperturbative description beyond the scale at which classical perturbation\ntheory breaks down in the original theory. This is particularly relevant if we\nwant to test modified gravity scenarios that exhibit Vainshtein screening on\nsolar system scales. We recognise the duals as being related to the Legendre\ntransform of the original Lagrangian, and present a practical method for\nfinding the dual in general; our methods can also be applied to\nself-interacting theories with a hierarchy of strong coupling scales, and with\nmultiple fields. We find the classical dual of the full quintic galileon theory\nas an example.\n", "  Due to the severe self-interaction errors associated with some density\nfunctional approximations, conventional density functionals often fail to\ndissociate the hemibonded structure of water dimer radical cation (H2O)2+ into\nthe correct fragments: H2O and H2O+. Consequently, the binding energy of the\nhemibonded structure (H2O)2+ is not well-defined. For a comprehensive\ncomparison of different functionals for this system, we propose three criteria:\n(i) The binding energies, (ii) the relative energies between the conformers of\nthe water dimer radical cation, and (iii) the dissociation curves predicted by\ndifferent functionals. The long-range corrected (LC) double-hybrid functional,\nomegaB97X-2(LP) [J.-D. Chai and M. Head-Gordon, J. Chem. Phys., 2009, 131,\n174105.], is shown to perform reasonably well based on these three criteria.\nReasons that LC hybrid functionals generally work better than conventional\ndensity functionals for hemibonded systems are also explained in this work.\n", "  Nuclear pairing is studied both in atomic nuclei and in neutron-star crusts\nin the unified framework of the energy-density functional theory using\ngeneralized Skyrme functionals complemented with a local pairing functional\nobtained from many-body calculations in homogeneous nuclear matter using\nrealistic forces.\n", "  I describe the foundation of a Density Functional Theory approach to include\npairing correlations, which was applied to a variety of systems ranging from\ndilute fermions, to neutron stars and finite nuclei. Ground state properties as\nwell as properties of excited states and time-dependent phenomena can be\nachieved in this manner within a formalism based on microscopic input.\n", "  Pierre Auger collaboration have recently put forward the hypothesis that the\narrival directions of the highest energy cosmic rays correlate with the subset\nof local active galactic nuclei (AGN). We perform a blind test of AGN\nhypothesis using publicly available event sets collected by Yakutsk, AGASA and\nHiRes experiments. The consistency of the procedure requires the event energies\nto be normalized towards the common energy scale. The number of correlating\nevents in resulting data-set is 3 of 21 which is consistent with expected\nrandom background.\n", "  Ultracold atomic gases and low-density neutron matter are unique in that they\nexhibit pairing gaps comparable to the Fermi energy which in this sense are the\nlargest in the laboratory and in nature, respectively. This strong pairing\nregime, or the crossover between BCS and BEC regimes, requires non-perturbative\ntreatments. We describe Quantum Monte Carlo results useful to understand the\nproperties of these systems, including infinite homogeneous matter and trapped\ninhomogeneous gases.\n", "  Rapidly rotating nuclei provide us good testing grounds to study the pairing\ncorrelations; in fact, the transition from the superfluid to the normal phase\nis realized at high-spin states. The role played by the pairing correlations is\nquite different in these two phases: The static (BCS like mean-field)\ncontribution is dominant in the superfluid phase, while the dynamic\nfluctuations beyond the mean-field approximation are important in the normal\nphase. The influence of the pairing fluctuations on the high-spin rotational\nspectra and moments of inertia is discussed.\n", "  Backbending is a typical phenomenon in the rotational spectra of superfluid\nnuclei. It is caused by the rotational alignment of a pair of nucleons and\ndepends on topological properties of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov spectrum in\nthe rotating frame characterized by diabolic points and Berry phases.\n", "  The present contribution reviews recent advances made toward a microscopic\nunderstanding of superfluidity in nuclei using many-body methods based on the\nBCS ansatz and low-momentum inter-nucleon interactions, themselves based on\nchiral effective field theory and renormalization group techniques.\n", "  We show two fascinating topics lying between quantum information processing\nand statistical mechanics. First, we introduce an elaborated technique, the\nsurface code, to prepare the particular quantum state with robustness against\ndecoherence. Second, we show another interesting technique to employ quantum\nnature, quantum annealing. Through both of the topics, we would shed light on\nthe birth of the interdisciplinary field between quantum mechanics and\nstatistical mechanics.\n", "  In this paper, we review some features of quantum annealing and related\ntopics from viewpoints of statistical physics, condensed matter physics, and\ncomputational physics. We can obtain a better solution of optimization problems\nin many cases by using the quantum annealing. Actually the efficiency of the\nquantum annealing has been demonstrated for problems based on statistical\nphysics. Then the quantum annealing has been expected to be an efficient and\ngeneric solver of optimization problems. Since many implementation methods of\nthe quantum annealing have been developed and will be proposed in the future,\ntheoretical frameworks of wide area of science and experimental technologies\nwill be evolved through studies of the quantum annealing.\n", "  The exact solution of the BCS pairing Hamiltonian was found by Richardson in\n1963. While little attention was paid to this exactly solvable model in the\nremainder of the 20th century, there was a burst of work at the beginning of\nthis century focusing on its applications in different areas of quantum\nphysics. We review the history of this exact solution and discuss recent\ndevelopments related to the Richardson-Gaudin class of integrable models,\nfocussing on the role of these various models in nuclear physics.\n", "  We investigate the four dimensional gravitational theories which admit\nhomogeneous but anisotropic black brane solutions in asymptotically AdS\nspace-time. The gravitational theories we consider are 1)\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, and 2) Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion theory\nwith SL(2,R) symmetry. We obtain the solutions both analytically and\nnumerically. Analytical solutions are obtained by perturbation from the\nisotropic solutions. Our solutions approach singular behavior at the horizon in\nthe extremal limit but in non-extremal case, they are smooth everywhere. We\nalso discuss how the third law of thermodynamics holds in our set-up.\n", "  The mechanisms of nuclear transfer reactions are described for the transfer\nof two nucleons from one nucleus to another. Two-nucleon overlap functions are\ndefined in various coordinate systems, and their transformation coefficients\ngiven between coordinate systems. Post and prior couplings are defined for\nsequential transfer mechanisms, and it is demonstrated that the combination of\n`prior-post' couplings avoids non-orthogonality terms, but does not avoid\ncouplings that do not have good zero-range approximations. The simultaneous and\nsequential mechanisms are demonstrated for the $^{124}$Sn(p,t)$^{122}$Sn\nreaction at 25 MeV using shell-model overlap functions. The interference\nbetween the various simultaneous and sequential amplitudes is shown.\n", "  Using the updated form factors within the light-cone QCD sum rule approach,\nwe calculate the new physics contributions to rare semileptonic $\\bar{B}_s \\to\n\\phi\\mu^+\\mu^-, \\phi \\tau^+\\tau^-$ decays from the new particles appearing in\nthe topcolor-assisted technicolor (TC2) model. In our evaluations, we find\nthat: (i) the branching ratio, normalized forward-backward asymmetry and lepton\npolarization show highly sensitivity to charged top-pions contributions and\nlittle sensitivity to $Z'$ contributions. The TC2 enhancements to the branching\nratios of these decays can reach a factor of $2 \\sim 4$; (ii) the NP\nenhancement to the forward-backward asymmetry of the decay $B_s\\to \\phi\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$ is in the range -9% to 22%, but -10% to 0% for decay $B_s\\to \\phi\n\\tau^+\\tau^-$ compared to the SM predictions; (iii) the TC2 model provide an\nenhancement of more than 30% to the longitudinal polarization asymmetry $P_L$\nfor decay $B_s\\to \\phi \\mu^+\\mu^-$, but a decrease of about 20% to the\ntransverse polarization asymmetry $P_T$ for the decay $B_s\\to \\phi\n\\tau^+\\tau^-$.\n", "  Recently it was demonstrated that magnon condensation in the trap exhibits\nthe phenomenon of self-localization. When the number of magnons in the textural\ntrap increases, they drastically modify the profile of the gap and highly\nincrease its size. The trap gradually transforms from the initial harmonic one\nto the box with walls almost impenetrable for magnons. The resulting\ntexture-free \"cavity\" filled by the magnon condensate wave function becomes the\nbosonic analog of the MIT bag, in which hadron is seen as a cavity surrounded\nby the QCD vacuum, in which the free quarks are confined in the ground or\nexcited state. Here we consider the bosonic analog of the MIT bag with quarks\non the ground and excited levels.\n", "  A novel Thomas-Fermi (TF) approach to inhomogeneous superfluid Fermi-systems\nis presented and shown that it works well also in cases where the Local Density\nApproximation (LDA) breaks down. The novelty lies in the fact that the\nsemiclassical approximation is applied to the pairing matrix elements not\nimplying a local version of the chemical potential as with LDA. Applications\nwill be given to the generic fact that if a fermionic superfluid in the BCS\nregime overflows from a narrow container into a much wider one, pairing is\nsubstantially reduced at the overflow point. Two examples pertinent to the\nphysics of the outer crust of neutron stars and superfluid fermionic atoms in\ntraps will be presented. The TF results will be compared to quantal and LDA\nones.\n", "  We present a general method for calculating the leading contributions to h ->\ngg and h -> gamma gamma in models where the Higgs weakly mixes with a nearly\nsupersymmetric extra sector. Such mixing terms can play an important role in\nraising the Higgs mass relative to the value expected in the MSSM. Our method\napplies even when the extra sector is strongly coupled, and moreover does not\nrequire a microscopic Lagrangian description. Using constraints from holomorphy\nwe fix the leading parametric form of the contributions to these Higgs\nprocesses, including the Higgs mixing angle dependence, up to an overall\ncoefficient. Moreover, when the Higgs is the sole source of mass for a\nsuperconformal sector, we show that even this coefficient is often calculable.\nFor appropriate mixing angles, the contribution of the extra states to h -> gg\nand h -> gamma gamma can vanish. We also discuss how current experimental\nlimits already lead to non-trivial constraints on such models. Finally, we\nprovide examples of extra sectors which satisfy the requirements necessary to\nuse the holomorphic approximation.\n", "  Multiple interactions between parton showers and the surrounding QCD matter\nare expected to underlie the strong medium-modifications of jet observables in\nultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC and at the LHC. Here, we note\nthat such jet-medium interactions alter generically and characteristically the\ncolor correlations in the parton shower. We characterize these effects in a\ncolor-differential calculation of the medium-induced gluon radiation spectrum\nto first and second order in opacity. By interfacing simple branching histories\nof medium-modified color flow with the Lund hadronization model, we analyze how\nthe medium modification of color correlations can affect the distribution of\nhadronic fragments in jets. Importantly, we observe that jet-medium\ninteractions give rise to the medium-induced color decoherence of gluons from\nthe parton shower. Since hadronization respects color flow and since each color\nsinglet in a parton shower is hadronized separately, this medium-induced color\ndecoherence leaves characteristic signatures in the jet fragmentation pattern.\nIn particular, it can contribute to the quenching of leading hadron spectra.\nMoreover, it can increase strongly the yield of soft hadronic fragments from a\njet, while the distribution of more energetic hadrons follows naturally the\nshape of a vacuum-like fragmentation pattern of lower total energy.\n", "  We investigate the type IIA AdS(3) x S(3) x M(4) superstring with M(4)=S(3) x\nS(1) or M(4)=T(4). String theory in this background is interesting because of\nAdS3/CFT2 and its newly discovered integrable structures. We derive the kappa\nsymmetry gauge-fixed Green-Schwarz string action to quadratic order in fermions\nand quartic order in fields utilizing a near BMN expansion. As a first\nconsistency check of our results we show that the two point functions are\none-loop finite in dimensional regularization. We then perform a Hamiltonian\nanalysis where we compare the energy of string states with the predictions of a\nset of conjectured Bethe equations. While we find perfect agreement for single\nrank one sectors, we find that the product SU(2) x SU(2) sector does not match\nunless the Bethe equations decouple completely. We then calculate 2 to 2\nbosonic tree-level scattering processes on the string worldsheet and show that\nthe two-dimensional S-matrix is reflectionless. This might be important due to\nthe presence of massless worldsheet excitations which are generally not\ndescribed by the Bethe equations.\n", "  In the context of (2+1)--dimensional Chern-Simons SL(N,R)\\times SL(N,R) gauge\nfields and spin N black holes we compute the on-shell action and show that it\ngenerates sensible and consistent thermodynamics. In particular, the\nChern-Simons action solves the integrability conditions recently considered in\nthe literature.\n", "  The elastic, thermodynamic, and electronic properties of fluorite RuO_2 under\nhigh pressure are investigated by plane-wave pseudopotential density functional\ntheory. The optimized lattice parameters, elastic constants, bulk modulus, and\nshear modulus are consistent with other theoretical values. The phase\ntransition from modified fluorite-type to fluorite is 88 GPa (by localized\ndensity approximation, LDA) or 115.5 GPa (by generalized gradient\napproximation, GGA). The Young's modulus and Lam\\'e's coefficients are also\nstudied under high pressure. The structure turned out to be stable for the\npressure up to 120 GPa by calculating elastic constants. In addition, the\nthermodynamic properties, including the Debye temperature, heat capacity,\nthermal expansion coefficient, Gr\\\"uneisen parameter, and Poisson's ratio, are\ninvestigated. A small band gap is found in the electronic structure of fluorite\nRuO_2 and the bandwidth increases with the pressure. Also, the present\nmechanical and electronic properties demonstrate that the bonding nature is a\ncombination of covalent, ionic, and metallic contributions.\n", "  We perform a systematic study of the $d=5$ Weinberg operator at the one-loop\nlevel. We identify three different categories of neutrino mass generation: (1)\nfinite irreducible diagrams; (2) finite extensions of the usual seesaw\nmechanisms at one-loop and (3) divergent loop realizations of the seesaws. All\nradiative one-loop neutrino mass models must fall into one of these classes.\nCase (1) gives the leading contribution to neutrino mass naturally and a\nclassic example of this class is the Zee model. We demonstrate that in order to\nprevent that a tree level contribution dominates in case (2), Majorana fermions\nrunning in the loop and an additional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry are needed for a\ngenuinely leading one-loop contribution. In the type-II loop extensions, the\nlepton number violating coupling will be generated at one loop, whereas the\ntype-I/III extensions can be interpreted as loop-induced inverse or linear\nseesaw mechanisms. For the divergent diagrams in category (3), the tree level\ncontribution cannot be avoided and is in fact needed as counter term to absorb\nthe divergence.\n", "  We study various aspects of fermions and their chiral condensates, both in\nthe bulk of AdS4 spacetime and in the dual boundary theory. For the most part,\nwe focus on a geometry with an infra-red hard wall. We show that, contrary to\ncommon lore, there exist boundary conditions in which the hard wall gives rise\nto a discrete, but gapless, fermionic spectrum. In such a setting, the presence\nof a magnetic field induces a bulk fermion condensate which spontaneously\nbreaks CP invariance. We develop the holographic dictionary between composite\noperators and show that this bulk condensate has the interpretation of boundary\nmagnetic catalysis involving a double-trace operator. Finally, we explain how\none can replace the hard wall with bulk magnetic monopoles. In such a\nframework, magnetic catalysis can be viewed as a consequence of the\nCallan-Rubakov effect.\n", "  Computed tomography (CT) to cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) deformable\nimage registration (DIR) is a crucial step in adaptive radiation therapy.\nCurrent intensity-based registration algorithms, such as demons, may fail in\nthe context of CT-CBCT DIR because of inconsistent intensities between the two\nmodalities. In this paper, we propose a variant of demons, called Deformation\nwith Intensity Simultaneously Corrected (DISC), to deal with CT-CBCT DIR. DISC\ndistinguishes itself from the original demons algorithm by performing an\nadaptive intensity correction step on the CBCT image at every iteration step of\nthe demons registration. Specifically, the intensity correction of a voxel in\nCBCT is achieved by matching the first and the second moments of the voxel\nintensities inside a patch around the voxel with those on the CT image. It is\nexpected that such a strategy can remove artifacts in the CBCT image, as well\nas ensuring the intensity consistency between the two modalities. DISC is\nimplemented on computer graphics processing units (GPUs) in compute unified\ndevice architecture (CUDA) programming environment. The performance of DISC is\nevaluated on a simulated patient case and six clinical head-and-neck cancer\npatient data. It is found that DISC is robust against the CBCT artifacts and\nintensity inconsistency and significantly improves the registration accuracy\nwhen compared with the original demons.\n", "  We study the polarisation of gauge bosons produced at the LHC. Polarisation\neffects for W bosons manifest themselves in the angular distributions of the\nlepton and in the distributions of lepton transverse momentum and missing\ntransverse energy. The distributions also depend on the selection cuts, with\nkinematic effects competing with polarisation effects. The polarisation is\ndiscussed for a range of different processes producing W bosons: W+jets, W from\ntop (single and pair) production, W pair production and W production in\nassociation with a Z or Higgs boson. The relative contributions of the\ndifferent polarisation states varies from process to process, reflecting the\ndynamics of the underlying hard-scattering process. We also present results for\nthe polarisation of the Z boson produced in association with QCD jets at the\nLHC, and comment on the differences between W and Z production.\n", "  Over the past few years the arithmetic Langlands program has found\napplications in two quite different problems that arise in string physics. The\nfirst of these is concerned with the fundamental problem of deriving the\ngeometry of spacetime from the worldsheet dynamics, leading to a realization of\nthe notion of an emergent spacetime in string theory. The second problem is\nconcerned with the idea of using automorphic black holes as probes of\nspacetime. In this article both of these applications of the Langlands program\nare described.\n", "  We complete the N=1 superfield action for the generic system of vector\nmultiplets and hypermultiplets coupled to 5D supergravity, which is based on\nthe superconformal formulation. Especially we clarify the gravitational\ncouplings to the bulk matters at linear order in the gravitational superfields.\nThey consist of four N=1 superfields, two of which are Z_2-odd when the fifth\ndimension is compactified on S^1/Z_2. This formulation provides a powerful tool\nto calculate quantum effects, keeping the N=1 off-shell structure.\n", "  We briefly survey our present understanding of the string landscape, and use\nit to discuss the chances that we will see low energy supersymmetry at the LHC.\n", "  We generalize the combinatorial description of the orbifold (Chen--Ruan)\ncohomology and of the Grothendieck ring of a Deligne--Mumford toric stack and\nits associated stacky fan in a lattice $N$ in the presence of a deformation\nparameter $\\beta \\in N \\otimes {\\mathbb C}.$ As an application, we construct a\ntopological mirror symmetry map that produces a complete system of\n$\\Gamma$--series solutions to the better behaved version of the GKZ\nhypergeometric system for $\\beta \\in N \\otimes {\\mathbb C}.$\n", "  On the basis of time-dependent mean-field picture, we discuss the nature of\nthe low-frequency quadrupole vibrations from small-amplitude to large-amplitude\nregimes as representatives of surface shape vibrations of a superfluid droplet\n(nucleus). We consider full five-dimensional quadrupole dynamics including\nthree-dimensional rotations restoring the broken symmetries as well as axially\nsymmetric and asymmetric shape fluctuations. We show that the intimate\nconnections between the BCS pairing and collective vibrations reveal through\nthe inertial masses governing their collective kinetic energies.\n", "  In experiments on model membranes, a formation of large domains of different\nlipid composition is readily observed. However, no such phase separation is\nobserved in the membranes of intact cells. Instead, a structure of small\ntransient inhomogeneities called lipid rafts are expected in these systems. One\nof the numerous attempts to explain small domains refers to the coupling of the\nmembrane to its surroundings, which leads to the immobilization of some of the\nmembrane molecules. These immobilized molecules then act as static obstacles\nfor the remaining mobile ones. We present detailed Molecular Dynamics\nsimulations demonstrating that this can indeed account for small domains. This\nconfirms previous Monte Carlo studies based on simplified models. Furthermore,\nby directly comparing domain structures obtained using Molecular Dynamics to\nMonte Carlo simulations of the Ising model, we demonstrate that domain\nformation in the presence of obstacles is remarkably insensitive to the details\nof the molecular interactions.\n", "  We study the deformation of a lipid membrane in response to a local pH\nmodification. Experimentally, a basic solution is microinjected close to a\ngiant unilamellar vesicle. A local deformation appears in the zone of the\nmembrane that is closest to the micropipette, and relaxes when the injection is\nstopped. A theoretical description of this phenomenon is provided. It takes\nfully into account the spatiotemporal evolution of the concentration of\nhydroxide ions during and after the microinjection, as well as the linear\ndynamics of the membrane. This description applies to a local injection of any\nsubstance that reacts reversibly with the membrane lipids. We compare\nexperimental data obtained in the domain of small deformations to the results\nof our linear description, and we obtain a good agreement between theory and\nexperiments. In addition, we present direct experimental observations of the pH\nprofile on the membrane during and after the microinjection, using pH-sensitive\nfluorescent lipids.\n", "  We construct a new detector to monitor $\\gamma$ yields in bunch by bunch\nbasis for the Laser Compton experiment at the KEK ATF which is capable to\nseparate $\\gamma$ rays in 5.6ns-spacing multi-bunch operation of the KEK ATF.\nIn this article we report a result of measurement of multi bunch $\\gamma$ ray\ndetection for the first time at the KEK ATF.\n", "  Neutron-proton (np-) pairing is expected to play an important role in the N Z\nnuclei. In general, it can have isovector and isoscalar character. The\nexistence of isovector np-pairing is well established. On the contrary, it is\nstill debated whether there is an isoscalar np-pairing. The review of the\nsituation with these two types of pairing with special emphasis on the\nisoscalar one is presented. It is concluded that there are no substantial\nevidences for the existence of isoscalar np-pairing.\n", "  The non-linear W_{\\infty}[\\mu] symmetry algebra underlies the duality between\nthe W_N minimal model CFTs and the hs[\\mu] higher spin theory on AdS_3. It is\nshown how the structure of this symmetry algebra at the quantum level, i.e. for\nfinite central charge, can be determined completely. The resulting algebra\nexhibits an exact equivalence (a`triality') between three (generically)\ndistinct values of the parameter \\mu. This explains, among other things, the\nagreement of symmetries between the W_N minimal models and the bulk higher spin\ntheory. We also study the consequences of this triality for some of the\nsimplest W_{\\infty}[\\mu] representations, thereby clarifying the analytic\ncontinuation between the`light states' of the minimal models and conical defect\nsolutions in the bulk. These considerations also lead us to propose that one of\nthe two scalar fields in the bulk actually has a non-perturbative origin.\n", "  We present the mathematical considerations which determine all gauge\ninvariant actions and anomaly candidates in gauge theories of standard type\nsuch as ordinary or gravitational Yang Mills theories. Starting from elementary\nconcepts of field theory the discussion tries to be explicit and complete, only\nthe cohomology of simple Lie algebras it quoted from the literature.\n", "  Previous explorations of the Asymptotic Safety scenario in Quantum Einstein\nGravity (QEG) by means of the effective average action and its associated\nfunctional renormalization group (RG) equation assumed spacetime manifolds\nwhich have no boundaries. Here we take a first step towards a generalization\nfor non-trivial boundaries, restricting ourselves to action functionals which\nare at most of second order in the derivatives acting on the metric. We analyze\ntwo examples of truncated actions with running boundary terms: full fledged QEG\nwithin the single-metric Einstein-Hilbert (EH) truncation, augmented by a scale\ndependent Gibbons-Hawking (GH) surface term, and a bi-metric truncation for\ngravity coupled to scalar matter fields. The latter contains 17 running\ncouplings, related to both bulk and boundary terms, whose beta-functions are\ncomputed in the induced gravity approximation. We find that the bulk and the\nboundary Newton constant, pertaining to the EH and GH term, respectively, show\nopposite RG running; proposing a scale dependent variant of the ADM mass we\nargue that the running of both couplings is consistent with gravitational\nanti-screening. We describe a simple device for counting the number of field\nmodes integrated out between the infrared cutoff scale and the ultraviolet.\nThis method makes it manifest that, in an asymptotically safe theory, there are\neffectively no field modes integrated out while the RG trajectory stays in the\nscaling regime of the underlying fixed point. As an application, we investigate\nhow the semiclassical theory of Black Hole Thermodynamics gets modified by\nquantum gravity effects and compare the new picture to older work on\n`RG-improved black holes' which incorporated the running of the bulk Newton\nconstant only. We find, for instance, that the black hole's entropy vanishes\nand its specific heat capacity turns positive at Planckian scales.\n", "  These notes, based on work with Herbi Dreiner and Howie Haber, discuss how to\ndo practical calculations of cross sections and decay rates using two-component\nfermion notation, as appropriate for supersymmetry and other\nbeyond-the-Standard-Model theories. Included are a list of two-component\nfermion Feynman rules for the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, and some\nexample calculations.\n", "  This article provides a complete user's guide to version 2.1 of the toric\ngeometry package PALP by Maximilian Kreuzer and others. In particular,\npreviously undocumented applications such as the program nef.x are discussed in\ndetail. New features of PALP 2.1 include an extension of the program mori.x\nwhich can now compute Mori cones and intersection rings of arbitrary dimension\nand can also take specific triangulations of reflexive polytopes as input.\nFurthermore, the program nef.x is enhanced by an option that allows the user to\nenter reflexive Gorenstein cones as input. The present documentation is\ncomplemented by a Wiki which is available online.\n", "  By the early 1960's advances in statistical physics had established the\nexistence of universality classes for systems with second-order phase\ntransitions and characterized these by critical exponents which are different\nto the classical ones. There followed the discovery of (now famous) scaling\nrelations between the power-law critical exponents describing second-order\ncriticality. These scaling relations are of fundamental importance and now form\na cornerstone of statistical mechanics. In certain circumstances, such scaling\nbehaviour is modified by multiplicative logarithmic corrections. These are also\ncharacterized by critical exponents, analogous to the standard ones. Recently\nscaling relations between these logarithmic exponents have been established.\nHere, the theories associated with these advances are presented and expanded\nand the status of investigations into logarithmic corrections in a variety of\nmodels is reviewed.\n", "  We apply the Lagrangian approach to study surface transport and mixing in the\nocean. New tools have been developed to track the motion of water masses, their\norigin and fate and to quantify transport and mixing. To illustrate the methods\nused we compute the Lagrangian synoptic maps a comparatively small marine bay,\nthe Peter the Great Bay in the Japan Sea near Vladivostok city (Russia), and in\na comparatively large region in the North Pacific, the Kuroshio Extension\nsystem. In the first case we use velocity data from a Japan Sea circulation\nnumerical model and in the second one the velocity data are derived from\nsatellite altimeter measurements of anomalies of the sea height distributed by\nAVISO.\n", "  The Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation is very useful for treating both\nlong- and short-range correlations in finite quantum fermion systems, but it\nmust be extended in order to describe detailed spectroscopic properties. One\nproblem is the symmetry-breaking character of the HFB approximation. We present\na general and systematic way to restore symmetries and to extend the\nconfiguration space using pfaffian formulas for the many-body matrix elements.\nThe advantage of those formulas is that the sign of the matrix elements is\nunambiguously determined. It is also helpful to extend the space of\nconfigurations by constraining the HFB solutions in some way. A powerful method\nfor finding these constrained solutions is the gradient method, based on the\ngeneralized Thouless transformation. The gradient method also preserves the\nnumber parity of the Bogoliubov transformation, which facilitates the\napplication of the theory to systems with odd particle number.\n", "  Consider a finite dimensional complex Hilbert space $\\cH$, with $dim(\\cH)\n\\geq 3$, define $\\bS(\\cH):= \\{x\\in \\cH \\:|\\: ||x||=1\\}$, and let $\\nu_\\cH$ be\nthe unique regular Borel positive measure invariant under the action of the\nunitary operators in $\\cH$, with $\\nu_\\cH(\\bS(\\cH))=1$. We prove that if a\ncomplex frame function $f : \\bS(\\cH)\\to \\bC$ satisfies $f \\in \\cL^2(\\bS(\\cH),\n\\nu_\\cH)$, then it verifies Gleason's statement: There is a unique linear\noperator $A: \\cH \\to \\cH$ such that $f(u) = < u| A u>$ for every $u \\in\n\\bS(\\cH)$. $A$ is Hermitean when $f$ is real. No boundedness requirement is\nthus assumed on $f$ {\\em a priori}.\n", "  The implementation of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a\ncold Rydberg gas provides an attractive route towards strong photon--photon\ninteractions and fully deterministic all-optical quantum information\nprocessing. In this brief review we discuss the underlying principles of how\nlarge single photon non-linearities are achieved in this system and describe\nexperimental progress to date.\n", "  New families of regular half-BPS solutions to 6-dimensional Type 4b\nsupergravity with $m$ tensor multiplets are constructed exactly. Their\nspace-time consists of $AdS_2 \\times S^2$ warped over a Riemann surface with an\narbitrary number of boundary components, and arbitrary genus. The solutions\nhave an arbitrary number of asymptotic $AdS_3 \\times S^3$ regions. In addition\nto strictly single-valued solutions to the supergravity equations whose scalars\nlive in the coset $SO(5,m)/SO(5)\\times SO(m)$, we also construct stringy\nsolutions whose scalar fields are single-valued up to transformations under the\n$U$-duality group $SO(5,m;\\bZ)$, and live in the coset $SO(5,m;\\bZ)\\backslash\nSO(5,m)/SO(5)\\times SO(m)$. We argue that these Type 4b solutions are\nholographically dual to general classes of interface and boundary CFTs arising\nat the juncture of the end-points of 1+1-dimensional bulk CFTs. We evaluate\ntheir corresponding holographic entanglement and boundary entropy, and discuss\ntheir brane interpretation. We conjecture that the solutions for which $\\Sigma$\nhas handles and multiple boundaries correspond to the near-horizon limit of\nhalf-BPS webs of dyonic strings and three-branes.\n", "  We study the effective hydrodynamics of neutral black branes enclosed in a\nfinite cylindrical cavity with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We focus on how\nthe Gregory-Laflamme instability changes as we vary the cavity radius R. Fixing\nthe metric at the cavity wall increases the rigidity of the black brane by\nhindering gradients of the redshift on the wall. In the effective fluid, this\nis reflected in the growth of the squared speed of sound. As a consequence,\nwhen the cavity is smaller than a critical radius the black brane becomes\ndynamically stable. The correlation with the change in thermodynamic stability\nis transparent in our approach. We compute the bulk and shear viscosities of\nthe black brane and find that they do not run with R. We find mean-field theory\ncritical exponents near the critical point.\n", "  We argue that evidence can be uncovered for stops between 300-600 GeV in 5\nfb^-1 of 7 TeV proton-proton collisions if they decay into top quarks and light\nneutral particles. We also show that with 20 fb^-1 of 8 TeV running, discovery\nor exclusion can be made in large regions of parameter space. Events with a\nfully hadronic top/anti-top pair and a pair of invisible decay products can be\nidentified with the top-tagging of a fat jet, a single b-tag, a missing\ntransverse energy cut, as well as other kinematic cuts to reduce backgrounds\nwith real top quarks in them. Such cuts obliterate the background suggesting\ndiscovery can be made with a handful of events.\n", "  Recently, an excess of events consistent with a Higgs boson with mass of\nabout 125 GeV was reported by the CMS and ATLAS experiments. This Higgs boson\nmass is consistent with the values that may be obtained in minimal\nsupersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model (SM), with both stop masses\nless than a TeV and large mixing. The apparently enhanced photon production\nrate associated with this potential Higgs signal may be the result of light\nstaus with large mixing. Large stau mixing and large coupling of the staus to\nthe SM-like Higgs boson may be obtained for large values of tan \\beta, and\nmoderate to large values of the Higgsino mass parameter, \\mu. We study the\nphenomenological properties of this scenario, including precision electroweak\ndata, the muon anomalous magnetic moment, Dark Matter, and the evolution of the\nsoft supersymmetry-breaking parameters to high energies. We also analyze the\npossible collider signatures of light third generation sleptons and demonstrate\nthat it is possible to find evidence of their production at the 8 TeV and the\n14 TeV LHC. The most promising channel is stau and tau sneutrino associated\nproduction, with the sneutrino decaying into a W boson plus a light stau.\n", "  In study of four-dimensional BPS states, quiver quantum mechanics plays a\ncentral role. The Coulomb phases capture the multi-centered nature of such\nstates, and are well understood in the context of wall-crossing. The Higgs\nphases are given typically by F-term-induced complete intersections in the\nambient D-term-induced toric varieties, and the ground states can be far more\nnumerous than the Coulomb phase counterparts. We observe that the Higgs phase\nBPS states are naturally and geometrically grouped into two parts, with one\npart given by the pulled-back cohomology from the D-term-induced ambient space.\nWe propose that these pulled-back states are in one-to-one correspondence with\nthe Coulomb phase states. This also leads us to conjecture that the index\nassociated with the rest, intrinsic to the Higgs phase,is a fundamental\ninvariant of quivers, independent of branches. For simple circular quivers,\nthese intrinsic Higgs states belong to the middle cohomology and thus are all\nangular momentum singlets, supporting the single-center black hole\ninterpretation.\n", "  We establish a connection between tree-level superamplitudes in ABJM theory\nand leading singularities associated to special three-particle cuts of one-loop\nsuperamplitudes where one of the tree amplitudes entering the cut is a\nfour-point amplitude. Using these relations, we show that certain intriguing\nsimilarities between one-loop and tree-level superamplitudes observed recently\nbecome completely manifest. This connection is reminiscent of a similar\nrelation in the maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions, where\nthe sum of two-mass hard and one-mass box coefficients of a one-loop amplitude\nequals the corresponding tree-level amplitude. As an application, we present a\nvery simple re-derivation of the six-point superamplitude and calculate the\neight-point superamplitude at one loop in ABJM theory.\n", "  The structure of atomic levels originating from the lowest Landau level in a\nsuperstrong magnetic field is analyzed. The influence of the screening of the\nCoulomb potential on the values of critical nuclear charge is studied.\n", "  Bursty fluctuations in the scrape-off layer (SOL) of Alcator C-Mod have been\nanalyzed using gas puff imaging data. This reveals many of the same fluctuation\nproperties as Langmuir probe measurements, including normal distributed\nfluctuations in the near SOL region while the far SOL plasma is dominated by\nlarge amplitude bursts due to radial motion of blob-like structures.\nConditional averaging reveals burst wave forms with a fast rise and slow decay\nand exponentially distributed waiting times. Based on this, a stochastic model\nof burst dynamics is constructed. The model predicts that fluctuation\namplitudes should follow a Gamma distribution. This is shown to be a good\ndescription of the gas puff imaging data, validating this aspect of the model.\n", "  We review a self-consistent scheme for modelling trapped weakly-interacting\nquantum gases at temperatures where the condensate coexists with a significant\nthermal cloud. This method has been applied to atomic gases by Zaremba, Nikuni,\nand Griffin, and is often referred to as ZNG. It describes both\nmean-field-dominated and hydrodynamic regimes, except at very low temperatures\nor in the regime of large fluctuations. Condensate dynamics are described by a\ndissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation (or the corresponding quantum\nhydrodynamic equation with a source term), while the non-condensate evolution\nis represented by a quantum Boltzmann equation, which additionally includes\ncollisional processes which transfer atoms between these two subsystems. In the\nmean-field-dominated regime collisions are treated perturbatively and the full\ndistribution function is needed to describe the thermal cloud, while in the\nhydrodynamic regime the system is parametrised in terms of a set of local\nvariables. Applications to finite temperature induced damping of collective\nmodes and vortices in the mean-field-dominated regime are presented.\n", "  The main purpose of this paper is to explore the solutions of Bianchi type\n$III$ cosmological model in Brans Dicke theory of gravity in the background of\nanisotropic dark energy. We use the assumption of constant deceleration\nparameter and power law relation between scalar field $\\phi$ and scale factor\n$a$ to find the solutions. The physical behavior of the solutions has been\ndiscussed using some physical quantities.\n", "  Additional neutral gauge fermions -- \"photini\" -- arise in string\ncompactifications as superpartners of U(1) gauge fields. Unlike their vector\ncounterparts, the photini can acquire weak-scale masses from soft SUSY breaking\nand lead to observable signatures at the LHC through mass mixing with the bino.\nIn this work we investigate the collider consequences of adding photini to the\nneutralino sector of the MSSM. Relatively large mixing of one or more photini\nwith the bino can lead to prompt decays of the lightest ordinary supersymmetric\nparticle; these extra cascades transfer most of the energy of SUSY decay chains\ninto Standard Model particles, diminishing the power of missing energy as an\nexperimental handle for signal discrimination. We demonstrate that the missing\nenergy in SUSY events with photini is reduced dramatically for supersymmetric\nspectra with MSSM neutralinos near the weak scale, and study the effects on\nlimits set by the leading hadronic SUSY searches at ATLAS and CMS. We find that\nin the presence of even one light photino the limits on squark masses from\nhadronic searches can be reduced by 400 GeV, with comparable (though more\nmodest) reduction of gluino mass limits. We also consider potential discovery\nchannels such as dilepton and multilepton searches, which remain sensitive to\nSUSY spectra with photini and can provide an unexpected route to the discovery\nof supersymmetry. Although presented in the context of photini, our results\napply in general to theories in which additional light neutral fermions mix\nwith MSSM gauginos.\n", "  A novel mathematical treatment is proposed for computing the time evolution\nof dynamic nuclear polarization processes in the low temperature thermal mixing\nregime. Without assuming any a priori analytical form for the electron\npolarization, our approach provides a quantitative picture of the steady state\nthat recovers the well known Borghini prediction based on thermodynamics\narguments, as long as the electrons-nuclei transition rates are fast compared\nto the other relevant time scales. Substantially different final polarization\nlevels are achieved instead when the latter assumption is relaxed in the\npresence of a nuclear leakage term, even though very weak, suggesting a\npossible explanation for the deviation between the measured steady state\npolarizations and the Borghini prediction. The proposed methodology also allows\nto calculate nuclear polarization and relaxation times, once specified the\nelectrons/nuclei concentration ratio and the typical rates of the microscopic\nprocesses involving the two spin species. Numerical results are shown to\naccount for the manifold dynamical behaviours of typical DNP samples.\n", "  There are two cases where QCD string is described by an effective theory of\nlong strings: the static potential and meson scattering amplitudes in the Regge\nregime. I show how the former can be solved in the mean-field approximation,\njustified by the large number of space-time dimensions, and argue that it turns\nout to be exact for the Nambu--Goto string. By adding extrinsic curvature I\ndemonstrate how the tachyonic instability of the ground-state energy can be\ncured by operators less relevant in the infrared.\n", "  We investigate the effect of top trilinear operators in t tbar production at\nthe ILC. We find that the sensitivity to these operators largely surpasses the\none achievable by the LHC either in neutral or charged current processes,\nallowing to probe new physics scales up to 4.5 TeV for a centre of mass energy\nof 500 GeV. We show how the use of beam polarisation and an eventual energy\nupgrade to 1 TeV allow to disentangle all effective operator contributions to\nthe Ztt and gamma tt vertices.\n", "  In earlier work, using the light cone picture, a world sheet field theory\nthat sums planar phi^3 graphs was constructed and developed. Since this theory\nis both non-local and not explicitly Lorentz invariant, it is desirable to have\na covariant and local alternative. In this paper, we construct such a covariant\nand local world sheet theory, and show that it is equivalent to the original\nnon-covariant version.\n", "  We present some general approach to emergent gauge theories and consider in\nsignificant detail the emergent tensor field gravity case. In essence, an\narbitrary local theory of a symmetric two-tensor field $H_{\\mu \\nu}$ in\nMinkowski spacetime is considered, in which the equations of motion are\nrequired to be compatible with a nonlinear $\\sigma $ model type length-fixing\nconstraint $H_{\\mu \\nu}^{2}=\\pm M^{2}$ leading to spontaneous Lorentz\ninvariance violation, SLIV ($M$ is the proposed scale for SLIV). Allowing the\nparameters in the Lagrangian to be adjusted so as to be consistent with this\nconstraint, the theory turns out to correspond to linearized general relativity\nin the weak field approximation, while some of the massless tensor Goldstone\nmodes appearing through SLIV are naturally collected in the physical graviton.\nThe underlying diffeomophism invariance emerges as a necessary condition for\nthe tensor field $H_{\\mu \\nu}$ not to be superfluously restricted in degrees of\nfreedom, apart from the constraint due to which the true vacuum in the theory\nis chosen by SLIV. The emergent theory appears essentially nonlinear, when\nexpressed in terms of the pure Goldstone tensor modes and contains a plethora\nof new Lorentz and $CPT$ violating couplings. However, these couplings do not\nlead to physical Lorentz violation once this tensor field gravity is properly\nextended to conventional general relativity.\n", "  Many of the concepts which are at the basis of the development associated\nwith a quantitative treatment of the variety of phenomena associated with the\nspontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry in nuclei have been instrumental in\nconnection with novel studies of soft matter, namely of protein evolution and\nprotein folding. Although the route to these subjects and associated\ndevelopment does not necessarily imply the nuclear physics connection, such a\nconnection has proven qualitatively and quantitatively inspiring. In particular\nto model protein evolution in terms of the alignment of quasispins displaying\ntwenty different projections, one for each of the twenty amino acids occurring\nin nature, and the associated symmetry breaking in information (sequence)\nspace. Emergent properties of the corresponding phase transition are domain\nwalls which stabilize local elementary structures (LES), few groups of 10-20\naminoacids which become structured already in the denatured state provide the\nmolecular recognition directing protein folding. In fact, their docking is\nclosely related to the transition state of the process. While the two-step, yes\nor no, folding process, does not provide direct information concerning LES, one\ncan force LES from virtual to become real, observable final state entities.\nGetting again inspiration from the nuclear case (virtual processes contributing\nto pair correlations can be forced to become real with the help of a probe\nwhich itself changes particle number by two), one would expect that to make\nreal virtual LES, that is segments of the protein which already at an early\nstage of the folding process flicker in and out of their native conformation,\none needs a probe which itself displays a similar behaviour. Peptides\ndisplaying a sequence identical to LES are such probes.\n", "  With the help of the static and dynamic mean field spectroscopic amplitudes,\ntaking into account successive and simultaneous transfer channels properly\ncorrected because of non-orthogonality effects, as well as describing the\nassociated elastic channels in terms of experimentally determined optical\npotentials, one obtains absolute, two-particle transfer differential cross\nsections which provide an overall account of the data within experimental\nerrors. One of the first results connected with such quantitative studies of\npairing correlations in nuclei is the observation of phonon mediated pairing in\nthe exotic halo nucleus $^{11}$Li, and the associated discovery of a new\nmechanism to break nuclear gauge symmetry: bootstrap, pigmy-resonance-mediated\nCooper pair binding.\n", "  Solid state quantum condensates can differ from other condensates, such as\nHelium, ultracold atomic gases, and superconductors, in that the condensing\nquasiparticles have relatively short lifetimes, and so, as for lasers, external\npumping is required to maintain a steady state. In this chapter we present a\nnon-equilibrium path integral approach to condensation in a dissipative\nenvironment and apply it to microcavity polaritons, driven out of equilibrium\nby coupling to multiple baths, describing pumping and decay. Using this, we\ndiscuss the relation between non-equilibrium polariton condensation, lasing,\nand equilibrium condensation.\n", "  The band alignment in ZnO/GaN and related heterostructures are crucial for\nthe uses in solar harvesting technology. Here, we report our density functional\ncalculations of the band alignment and optical properties of ZnO/GaN and\nZnO/(Ga1-xZnx)(N1-xOx)/GaN heterostructures using a Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof\n(HSE) hybrid functional. We found that the conventional GGA functionals\nunderestimate not only the band gap but also the band offset of these\nheterostructures. Using the hybrid functional calculations, we show that the\n(Ga1-xZnx)(N1-xOx) solid solution has a direct band gap of about 2.608 eV, in\ngood agreement with the experimental data. More importantly, this solid\nsolution forms type-II band alignment with the host materials. A\nGaN/(Ga1-xZnx)(N1-xOx)/ZnO core-shell solar cell model is presented to improve\nthe visible light adsorption ability and carrier collection efficiency.\n", "  The Daya Bay reactor antineutrino experiment has recently measured the\nneutrino mixing parameter sin22{\\theta}13 by observing electron antineutrino\ndisappearance over kilometer-scale baselines using six antineutrino detectors\nat near and far distances from reactor cores at the Daya Bay nuclear power\ncomplex. Liquid scintillator contained in transparent target vessels is used to\ndetect electron antineutrinos via the inverse beta-decay reaction. The Daya Bay\nexperiment will operate for about five years yielding a precision measurement\nof sin22{\\theta}13. We report on long-term studies of poly(methyl methacrylate)\nknown as acrylic, which is the primary material used in the fabrication of the\ntarget vessels for the experiment's antineutrino detectors. In these studies,\nacrylic samples are subjected to gaseous and liquid environmental conditions\nsimilar to those experienced during construction, transport, and operation of\nthe Daya Bay acrylic target vessels and detectors. Mechanical and optical\nstability of the acrylic as well as its interaction with detector liquids is\nreported.\n", "  Quantum entanglement lies at the heart of quantum information theory, with\napplications to quantum computing, teleportation, cryptography and\ncommunication. In the apparently separate world of quantum gravity, the Hawking\neffect of radiating black holes has also occupied centre stage. Despite their\napparent differences, it turns out that there is a correspondence between the\ntwo.\n", "  In this paper we study the gluino dijet mass edge measurement at the LHC in a\nrealistic situation including both SUSY and combinatorical backgrounds together\nwith effects of initial and final state radiation as well as a finite detector\nresolution. Three benchmark scenarios are examined in which the dominant SUSY\nproduction process and also the decay modes are different. Several new\nkinematical variables are proposed to minimize the impact of SUSY and\ncombinatorial backgrounds in the measurement. By selecting events with a\nparticular number of jets and leptons, we attempt to measure two distinct\ngluino dijet mass edges originating from wino $\\tilde g \\to jj \\tilde W$ and\nbino $\\tilde g \\to jj \\tilde B$ decay modes, separately. We determine the\nendpoints of distributions of proposed and existing variables and show that\nthose two edges can be disentangled and measured within good accuracy,\nirrespective of the presence of ISR, FSR, and detector effects.\n", "  The problem of counting points is revisited from the perspective of reflexive\n4-dimensional polytopes. As an application, the Hilbert series of the\n473,800,776 reflexive polytopes (equivalently, their Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces)\nare computed.\n", "  A brief review of recent progress in the ab intio theory of nuclear pairing\nis given. Nowdays several successful solutions of the ab intio BCS theory gap\nequation were published which show that it is a promising first step in the\nproblem. However, the role of many-body correlations that go beyond the BCS\nscheme remains uncertain and requires further investigations. As an\nalternative, the semi-microscopic model is discussed in which the effective\npairing interaction calculated from the first principles is supplemented with a\nsmall phenomenological addendum containing one phenomenological parameter\nuniversal for all medium and heavy atomic nuclei.\n", "  We present an overview of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory of\nnucleonic superfluidity for finite nuclei. After introducing basic concepts\nrelated to pairing correlations, we show how the correlated pairs are\nincorporated into the HFB wave function. Thereafter, we present derivation and\nstructure of the HFB equations within the superfluid nuclear density functional\nformalism and discuss several aspects of the theory, including the unitarity of\nthe Bogoliubov transformation in truncated single-particle and quasiparticle\nspaces, form of the pairing functional, structure of the HFB continuum,\nregularization and renormalization of pairing fields, and treatment of pairing\nin systems with odd particle numbers.\n", "  We compute the entropy and the corresponding central charge of the self-dual\nstring soliton in the supergravity regime using the blackfold description of\nthe fully localized M2-M5 intersection.\n", "  We consider an infinite class of 5d supersymmetric gauge theories involving\nproducts of symplectic and unitary groups that arise from D4-branes at orbifold\nsingularities in Type I' string theory. The theories are argued to be dual to\nwarped AdS(6)x S4/Zn backgrounds in massive Type IIA supergravity. In\nparticular, this demonstrates the existence of supersymmetric 5d fixed points\nof quiver type. We analyze the spectrum of gauge fields and charged states in\nthe supergravity dual, and find a precise agreement with the symmetries and\ncharged operators in the quiver theories. We also comment on other brane\nobjects in the supergravity dual and their interpretation in the field\ntheories.\n", "  In order to maintain efficient tracking in the forward region of H1 after the\nluminosity upgrade of the HERA machine, the H1 Forward Track Detector was also\nupgraded. While much of the original software and techniques used for the HERA\nI phase could be reused, the software for pattern recognition was completely\nrewritten. This, along with several other improvements in hit finding and\nhigh-level track reconstruction, are described in detail together with a\nsummary of the performance of the detector.\n", "  In this review, I present a brief summary of the impact of nucleon pairing at\nsupra-nuclear densities on the cooling of neutron stars. I also describe how\nthe recent observation of the cooling of the neutron star in the supernova\nremnant Cassiopeia A may provide us with the first direct evidence for the\noccurrence of such pairing. It also implies a size of the neutron 3P-F2 energy\ngap of the order of 0.1 MeV.\n", "  We review c-field methods for simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics of\ndegenerate Bose gases beyond the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii approximation. We\ndescribe three separate approaches that utilise similar numerical methods, but\nhave distinct regimes of validity. Systems at finite temperature can be treated\nwith either the closed-system projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (PGPE), or\nthe open-system stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE). These\nare both applicable in quantum degenerate regimes in which thermal fluctuations\nare significant. At low or zero temperature, the truncated Wigner projected\nGross-Pitaevskii equation (TWPGPE) allows for the simulation of systems in\nwhich spontaneous collision processes seeded by quantum fluctuations are\nimportant. We describe the regimes of validity of each of these methods, and\ndiscuss their relationships to one another, and to other simulation techniques\nfor the dynamics of Bose gases. The utility of the SPGPE formalism in modelling\nnon-equilibrium Bose gases is illustrated by its application to the dynamics of\nspontaneous vortex formation in the growth of a Bose-Einstein condensate.\n", "  The standard theoretical basis for understanding superfluidity in Bose\nsystems was formulated by Beliaev in 1957, based on splitting the quantum field\noperator into a macroscopically occupied condensate component and a\nnon-condensate component. This leads to a description of the condensate in\nterms of a 'single-particle state', the so-called macroscopic wavefunction.\nSince the discovery of Bose-condensed gases, an alternative theoretical picture\nhas been developed which is based on a 'coherent band' of classically occupied\nstates. This is often called the classical or c-field approach. The goal of\nthis chapter is to review the differences between the Beliaev broken symmetry\nand c-field approach, and to argue that the c-field concept of a coherent\ncondensate band of states has problems as a description of Bose superfluidity.\nHowever, the c-field idea of treating the lowest energy excitations classically\ncan be used to advantage to simplify calculations within the Beliaev\nbroken-symmetry formalism.\n", "  We present our views on the issues raised in the chapter by Griffin and\nZaremba [A. Griffin and E. Zaremba, in Quantum Gases: Finite Temperature and\nNon-Equilibrium Dynamics, N. P. Proukakis, S. A. Gardiner, M. J. Davis, and M.\nH. Szymanska, eds., Imperial College Press, London (in press)]. We review some\nof the strengths and limitations of the Bose symmetry-breaking assumption, and\nexplain how such an approach precludes the description of many important\nphenomena in degenerate Bose gases. We discuss the theoretical justification\nfor the classical-field (c-field) methods, their relation to other\nnon-perturbative methods for similar systems, and their utility in the\ndescription of beyond-mean-field physics. Although it is true that present\nimplementations of c-field methods cannot accurately describe certain\ncollective oscillations of the partially condensed Bose gas, there is no\nfundamental reason why these methods cannot be extended to treat such\nscenarios. By contrast, many regimes of non-equilibrium dynamics that can be\ndescribed with c-field methods are beyond the reach of generalised mean-field\nkinetic approaches based on symmetry-breaking, such as the ZNG formalism.\n", "  We discuss the spatial structure of the Cooper pair in dilute neutron matter\nand neutron-rich nuclei by means of the BCS theory and the\nSkyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogioliubov model, respectively. The neutron pairing in\ndilute neutron matter is close to the region of the BCS-BEC crossover in a wide\ndensity range, giving rise to spatially compact Cooper pair whose size is\nsmaller than the average interaparticle distance. This behavior extends to\nmoderate low density ($\\sim 10^{-1}$ of the saturation density) where the\nCooper pair size becomes smallerst ($\\sim 5$ fm). The Cooper pair in finite\nnuclei also exhibits the spatial correlation favoring the coupling of neutrons\nat small relative distances $r \\lesim 3$ fm with large probability.\nNeutron-rich nuclei having small neutron separation energy may provide us\nopportunity to probe the spatial correlation since the neutron pairing and the\nspatial correlation persists also in an area of low-density neutron\ndistribution extending from the surface to far outside the nucleus.\n", "  Quantum computers can execute algorithms that sometimes dramatically\noutperform classical computation. Undoubtedly the best-known example of this is\nShor's discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for factoring integers,\nwhereas the same problem appears to be intractable on classical computers.\nUnderstanding what other computational problems can be solved significantly\nfaster using quantum algorithms is one of the major challenges in the theory of\nquantum computation, and such algorithms motivate the formidable task of\nbuilding a large-scale quantum computer. This article will review the current\nstate of quantum algorithms, focusing on algorithms for problems with an\nalgebraic flavor that achieve an apparent superpolynomial speedup over\nclassical computation.\n", "  We compute the three-loop QCD corrections to the decoupling constant for\n$\\alpha_s$ which relates the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model to Quantum\nChromodynamics with five or six active flavours. The new results can be used to\nstudy the stability of $\\alpha_s$ evaluated at a high scale from the knowledge\nof its value at $M_Z$. We furthermore derive a low-energy theorem which allows\nthe calculation of the coefficient function of the effective Higgs boson-gluon\noperator from the decoupling constant. This constitutes the first independent\ncheck of the matching coefficient to three loops.\n", "  We review the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii approach for non-equilibrium finite\ntemperature Bose gases, focussing on the formulation of Stoof; this method\nprovides a unified description of condensed and thermal atoms, and can thus\ndescribe the physics of the critical fluctuation regime. We discuss\nsimplifications of the full theory, which facilitate straightforward numerical\nimplementation, and how the results of such stochastic simulations can be\ninterpreted, including the procedure for extracting phase-coherent\n(`condensate') and density-coherent (`quasi-condensate') fractions. The power\nof this methodology is demonstrated by successful ab initio modelling of\nseveral recent atom chip experiments, with the important information contained\nin each individual realisation highlighted by analysing dark soliton decay\nwithin a phase-fluctuating condensate.\n", "  Considered is spherical shell as a model for visible universe and parameters\nthat such model must have to comply with the observable data. The topology of\nthe model requires that motion of all galaxies and light must be confined\ninside a spherical shell. Consequently the observable universe cannot be\ndefined as a sphere centered on the observer, rather it is an arc length within\nthe volume of the spherical shell. The radius of the shell is 4.46 $\\pm$ 0.06\nGpc, which is for factor $\\pi$ smaller than radius of a corresponding 3-sphere.\nHowever the event horizon, defined as the arc length inside the shell, has the\nsize of 14.0 $\\pm$ 0.2 Gpc, which is in agreement with the observable data. The\nmodel predicts, without inflation theory, the isotropy and uniformity of the\nCMB. It predicts the correct value for the Hubble constant $H_0$ = 67.26 $\\pm$\n0.90 km/s/Mpc, the cosmic expansion rate $H(z)$, and the speed of the event\nhorizon in agreement with observations. The theoretical suport for shell model\ncomes from general relativity, curvature of space by mass, and from holographic\nprinciple. The model explains the reason for the established discrepancy\nbetween the non-covariant version of the holographic principle and the\ncalculated dimensionless entropy $(S/k)$ for the visible universe, which\nexceeds the entropy of a black hole. The model is in accordance with the\ndistribution of radio sources in space, type Ia data, and data from the Hubble\nUltra Deep Field optical and near-infrared survey.\n", "  We examine a minimal model for an active colloidal fluid in the form of\nself-propelled Brownian hard spheres that interact purely through excluded\nvolume. Despite the absence of an aligning interaction, this system shows the\nsignature behaviors of an active fluid, including anomalous number fluctuations\nand phase separation behavior. Using simulations and analytic modeling, we\nquantify the phase diagram and separation kinetics. The dense phase is a unique\nmaterial that we call an active hexatic, which exhibits the structural\nsignatures of a crystalline solid near the crystal-hexatic transition point,\nbut the rheological and transport properties associated with a viscoelastic\nfluid.\n", "  These lectures were originally given at TASI and are directed at a level\nsuitable for graduate students in High Energy Physics. They are intended to\ngive an introduction to the theory and phenomenology of quantum chromodynamics\n(QCD), focusing on collider physics applications. The aim is to bring the\nreader to a level where informed decisions can be made concerning different\napproaches and their uncertainties. The material is divided into five main\nareas: 1) fundamentals, 2) fixed-order perturbative QCD, 3) Monte Carlo event\ngenerators and parton showers, 4) Matching at Leading and Next-to-Leading\nOrder, and 5) Soft QCD physics.\n", "  An idea which has been around in general relativity for more than forty years\nis that in the approach to a big bang singularity solutions of the Einstein\nequations can be approximated by the Kasner map, which describes a succession\nof Kasner epochs. This is already a highly non-trivial statement in the\nspatially homogeneous case. There the Einstein equations reduce to ordinary\ndifferential equations and it becomes a statement that the solutions of the\nEinstein equations can be approximated by heteroclinic chains of the\ncorresponding dynamical system. For a long time progress on proving a statement\nof this kind rigorously was very slow but recently there has been new progress\nin this area, particularly in the case of the vacuum Einstein equations. In\nthis paper we generalize some of these results to the Einstein-Maxwell\nequations. It turns out that this requires new techniques since certain\neigenvalues are in a less favourable configuration in the case with a magnetic\nfield. The difficulties which arise in that case are overcome by using the fact\nthat the dynamical system of interest is of geometrical origin and thus has\nuseful invariant manifolds.\n", "  Accelerator science and technology is inherently an integrative discipline\nthat combines aspects of physics, computational science, electrical and\nmechanical engineering. As few universities offer full academic programs, the\neducation of accelerator physicists and engineers for the future has primarily\nrelied on a combination of on-the-job training supplemented with intense\ncourses at regional accelerator schools. This paper describes the approaches\nbeing used to satisfy the educational interests of a growing number of\ninterested physicists and engineers.\n", "  Compact spatial dimension at the TeV scale remain an intriguing possibility\nthat is currently being tested at the LHC. We give an introductory review of\nextra-dimensional models and ideas, from a phenomenological perspective, but\nemphasizing the appropriate theoretical tools. We emphasize the power and\nlimitations of such constructions, and give a self-contained account of the\nmethods necessary to understand the associated physics. We also review a number\nof examples that illustrate how extra-dimensional ideas can shed light on open\nquestions in the Standard Model. An introduction to holography is provided.\nThese are the notes of my TASI 2011 Lectures on Extra Dimensions.\n", "  The present manuscript summarizes the modern view on the problem of the\ngraphene-metal interaction. Presently, the close-packed surfaces of d metals\nare used as templates for the preparation of highly-ordered graphene layers.\nDifferent classifications can be introduced for these systems: graphene on\nlattice-matched and graphene on lattice-mismatched surfaces where the\ninteraction with the metallic substrate can be either \"strong\" or \"weak\". Here\nthese classifications, with the focus on the specific features in the\nelectronic structure in all cases, are considered on the basis of large amounts\nof experimental and theoretical data, summarized and discussed. The\nperspectives of the graphene-metal interface in fundamental and applied physics\nand chemistry are pointed out.\n", "  Assuming the existence of a Bose-Einstein condensate composed of the majority\nof a sample of ultracold, trapped atoms, perturbative treatments to incorporate\nthe non-condensate fraction are common. Here we describe how this may be\ncarried out in an explicitly number-conserving fashion, providing a common\nframework for the work of various authors; we also briefly consider issues of\nimplementation, validity and application of such methods.\n", "  Two-nucleon removal (or knock-out) reactions at intermediate energies are a\ndeveloping tool for both nuclear spectroscopy and for the study of certain\nnucleon correlations in very exotic and some stable nuclei. We present an\noverview of these reactions with specific emphasis on the nature of the\ntwo-nucleon correlations that can be probed. We outline future possibilities\nand tests needed to fully establish these sensitivities.\n", "  We present force-clamp data on the collapse of ubiquitin polyproteins in\nresponse to a quench in the force. These nonequilibrium trajectories are\nanalyzed using a general method based on a diffusive assumption of the\nend-to-end length to reconstruct a downhill free energy profile at 5pN and an\nenergy plateau at 10pN with a slow diffusion coefficient on the order\nof~100nm^2/s. The shape of the free energy and its linear scaling with the\nprotein length give validity to a physical model for the collapse. However, the\nlength independent diffusion coefficient suggests that internal rather than\nviscous friction dominates and thermal noise is needed to capture the\nvariability in the measured times to collapse.\n", "  This note summarizes a pedagogical tutorial on CalcHEP and PYTHIA that was\ngiven at TASI 2011 program.\n", "  Ultracold polar molecules trapped on an optical lattice is a many-body system\nthat, under appropriate conditions, may support collective excitations\nreminiscent of excitons in solid state crystals. Here, we discuss the\nrotational excitations of molecules on an optical lattice leading to rotational\nFrenkel excitons. Apart from solid hydrogen, there is no other natural system\nthat exhibits rotational excitons. The rotational excitons have unique\nproperties that can be exploited for tuning non-linear exciton interactions and\nexciton-impurity scattering by applying an external electric field. We show\nthat this can be used to explore the competing role of the dynamical and\nkinematic exciton-exciton interactions in excitonic energy transfer and to\nstudy quantum localization in a dynamically tunable disordered potential. The\nrotational excitons can also be used as a basis for quantum simulation of\ncondensed matter models that cannot be realized with ultracold atoms. As an\nexample, we discuss the possibility of engineering the Holstein model with\npolar molecules on an optical lattice.\n", "  We report a new extraction of nucleon resonance couplings using pi-\nphotoproduction cross sections on the neutron. The world database for the\nprocess gn-->pi-p above 1 GeV has quadrupled with the addition of new\ndifferential cross sections from the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS)\nat Jefferson Lab in Hall B. Differential cross sections from CLAS have been\nimproved with a new final-state interaction determination using a diagrammatic\ntechnique taking into account the SAID phenomenological NN and piN final-state\ninteraction amplitudes. Resonance couplings have been extracted and compared to\nprevious determinations. With the addition of these new cross sections,\nsignificant changes are seen in the high-energy behavior of the SAID cross\nsections and amplitudes.\n", "  The recent availability of radioactive beams has opened up a new era in\nnuclear physics. The interactions and structure of exotic nuclei close to the\ndrip lines have been studied extensively world wide, and it has been revealed\nthat unstable nuclei, having weakly bound nucleons, exhibit characteristic\nfeatures such as a halo structure and a soft dipole excitation. We here review\nthe developments of the physics of unstable nuclei in the past few decades. The\ntopics discussed in this Chapter include the halo and skin structures, the\nCoulomb breakup, the dineutron correlation, the pair transfer reactions, the\ntwo-nucleon radioactivity, the appearance of new magic numbers, and the pygmy\ndipole resonances.\n", "  Superconducting rf technology (SRF) is evolving rapidly as are its\napplications. While there is active exploitation of what one may term the\ncurrent state-of-the-practice, there is also rapid progress expanding in\nseveral dimensions the accessible and useful parameter space. While\nstate-of-the-art performance sometimes outpaces thorough understanding, the\nimproving scientific understanding from active SRF research is clarifying\nroutes to obtain optimum performance from present materials and opening avenues\nbeyond the standard bulk niobium. The improving technical basis understanding\nis enabling process engineering to both improve performance confidence and\nreliability and also unit implementation costs. Increasing confidence in the\ntechnology enables the engineering of new creative application designs. We\nattempt to survey this landscape to highlight the potential for future\naccelerator applications.\n", "  We propose a simple laboratory experiment to measure the speed of propagation\nof gravitational phenomena. We consider two masses placed at two different\ndistances from a detector of gravitational force. They are placed so that the\nstatic gravitational force they produce at the detector exactly cancels. We\nshow that if the masses are made to oscillate, then the force on the detector\nno longer vanishes and is proportional to the relative time delay it takes for\nthe propagation of the gravitational changes from the masses to the detector.\nThis time delay is inversely proportional to the speed of gravity. A\nmeasurement of the finiteness of this speed would be the first confirmation of\none dynamical aspect of Einstein's theory of general relativity, that\ngravitational effects are not instantaneous and propagate at a finite velocity\nand a direct confirmation of the fundamental notion that there is no action at\na distance. It is fully expected that the speed of gravity is equal to the\nspeed of light.\n", "  A theoretical study of Goldstone boson scattering based on the chiral\nLagrangian with vector meson fields is presented. In application of a recently\ndeveloped novel approach we extrapolate subthreshold partial-wave amplitudes\ninto the physical region. The constraints set by micro-causality and\ncoupled-channel unitarity are kept rigourously. It is shown that already the\nleading order subthreshold amplitudes lead to s- and p-wave $\\pi\\pi$ and $\\pi\nK$ phase shifts are in agreement with the experimental data up to about 1.2\nGeV.\n", "  We give a short overview of the theory of the muon anomalous magnetic moment\nwith emphasis on the hadronic light-by-light and the pion loop contribution. We\nexplain the difference between the hidden local symmetry and full VMD pion loop\nand discuss leading logarithms in the anomalous sector of 2-flavour chiral\nperturbation theory.\n", "  This is a somewhat personal account of the contributions of Max Kreuzer to\nthe study of Calabi-Yau manifolds and has been prepared as a contribution to\nthe Memorial Volume: Strings, Gauge Fields, and the Geometry Behind - The\nLegacy of Maximilian Kreuzer, to be published by World Scientific.\n", "  We present the analysis of Ref.[1] of the radial (n) and angular-momentum (J)\nRegge trajectories for all light-quark meson states listed in the Particle Data\nTables. The parameters of the trajectories are obtained with linear regression,\nwith weight of each resonance inversely proportional to its half-width squared,\n(\\Gamma/2)^2. The joint analysis in the (n,J,M^2) Regge plane indicates, at the\n4.5 standard deviation level, that the slopes in n are larger from the slopes\nin J. Thus no strict universality of slopes occurs in the light non-strange\nmeson sector. We also extend our analysis to the kaon sector.\n", "  The $\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\pi\\pi$ reactions are discussed. To describe those\nprocesses, we include dipion continuum, resonances, high-energy pion-pion\nrescatterings, $\\rho$ meson exchange and pQCD Brodsky-Lepage mechanisms. The\ncross section for the production of pion pairs in photon-photon collisions in\nperipheral heavy ion collisions is calculated with the help of Equivalent\nPhoton Approximaption (EPA) in the impact parameter space. We show predictions\nat $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.5$ TeV which could be measured e.g. by the ALICE\ncollaboration at the LHC.\n", "  A simple introduction of renormalization in quantum field theory is\ndiscussed. Explanation of concepts is emphasized instead of the technical\ndetails.\n", "  The eta' meson mass may be reduced due to partial restoration of chiral\nsymmetry. If this is the case, an eta'-nucleus system may form a nuclear bound\nstate. We plan to carry out a missing-mass spectroscopy with the 12C(p,d)\nreaction at GSI-SIS. Peak structures corresponding to such a bound state may be\nobserved even in an inclusive measurement, if the decay width is narrow enough.\n", "  The eta-mesic nuclei in which the {\\eta} meson is bound with nucleus via\nstrong interaction was postulated already in 1986, however till now no\nexperiment confirmed empirically its existence. The discovery of this new kind\nof an exotic nuclear matter would be very important for better understanding of\nthe {\\eta} meson structure and its interaction with nucleons. The search for\n{\\eta}-mesic helium is carried out with high statistic and high acceptance with\nthe WASA-at-COSY detection setup in the Research Center Juelich. The search is\nconducted via the measurement of the excitation function for the chosen decay\nchannels of the 4He-{\\eta} system. Till now two reactions dd -->\n(4He-{\\eta})_bs --> 3Hep\\pi- and dd --> (4He-{\\eta})_bs --> 3 Hen{\\pi}0 were\nmeasured with the beam momentum ramped around the eta production threshold.\nThis report includes the description of experimental method and status of the\nanalysis.\n", "  We discuss charm production at the LHC. The production of single $c \\bar c$\npairs is calculated in the $k_t$-factorization approach. We use\nKimber-Martin-Ryskin unintegrated gluon distributions in the proton. The\nhadronization is included with the help of Peterson fragmentation functions.\nTransverse momentum and pseudorapidity distributions of charmed mesons are\npresented and compared to recent results of the ALICE, LHCb and ATLAS\ncollaborations. Furthermore we discuss production of two pairs of $c \\bar c$\nwithin a simple formalism of double-parton scattering (DPS). Surprisingly large\ncross sections, comparable to single-parton scattering (SPS), are predicted for\nLHC energies. We discuss perspectives how to identify the double scattering\ncontribution. We predict much larger cross section for large rapidity distance\nbetween charm quarks from different hard parton scatterings compared to single\nscattering.\n", "  The so-called extended linear sigma model is a chiral model with\n(pseudo)scalar and (axial-)vector mesons. It is based on the requirements of\n(global) chiral symmetry and dilatation invariance. The purpose of this model\nis the description of the hadron phenomenology up to 1.7 GeV. We present the\nlatest theoretical results, which show a good agreement with the experiment.\n", "  An approach to construction of static models is demonstrated for a fluid\nball. Five examples are considered. Two of them are exact solutions of the\nEinstein equations; the other three are connected with the Airy special\nfunctions, the hypergeometric functions and the Heun functions.\n", "  We report on some recent developments in our understanding of the light-quark\nmass dependence and the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking corrections to the\nmagnetic moments of the ground-state baryons in a covariant formulation of\nbaryon chiral perturbation theory, the so-called EOMS formulation. We show that\nthis covariant ChPT exhibits some promising features compared to its\nheavy-baryon and infrared counterparts.\n", "  $K_{\\ell4}$ are for several reasons an especially interesting decay channel\nof $K$ mesons: $K_{\\ell4}$ decays allow an accurate measurement of a\ncombination of $S$-wave $\\pi\\pi$ scattering lengths, one form factor of the\ndecay is connected to the chiral anomaly and the decay is the best source for\nthe determination of some low energy constants of ChPT. We present a dispersive\napproach to $K_{\\ell4}$ decays, which takes rescattering effects fully into\naccount. Some fits to NA48/2 and E865 measurements and results of the matching\nto ChPT are shown.\n", "  We report on a recent study of finite-volume effects on the lowest-lying\noctet baryon masses using the covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory up to\nnext-to-leading order by analysing the latest $n_f = 2 + 1$ lattice QCD results\nfrom the NPLQCD Collaboration.\n", "  In this talk the handbag approach to hard exclusive wide-angle processes is\nreviewed and applications, as for instance two-photon annihilations into pairs\nof mesons, are discussed.\n", "  We study point particles in 2+1 dimensional first order gravity using a\ntriangulation to fix the connection and frame-field. The Hamiltonian is reduced\nto a boundary term which yields the total mass. The triangulation is dynamical\nwith non-trivial transitions occurring when a particle meets an edge. This\nframework facilitates a description in terms of the loop gravity phase space.\n", "  The results of the microscopic transport calculations of $\\bar p$-nucleus\ninteractions within a GiBUU model are presented. The dominating mechanism of\nhyperon production is the strangeness exchange processes $\\bar K N \\to Y \\pi$\nand $\\bar K N \\to \\Xi K$. The calculated rapidity spectra of $\\Xi$ hyperons are\nsignificantly shifted to forward rapidities with respect to the spectra of\n$S=-1$ hyperons. We argue that this shift should be a sensitive test for the\npossible exotic mechanisms of $\\bar p$-nucleus annihilation. The production of\nthe double $\\Lambda$-hypernuclei by $\\Xi^-$ interaction with a secondary target\nis calculated.\n", "  The study of nucleon resonances in electromagnetic meson production with the\nCLAS detector is discussed. The electromagnetic interaction is complementary to\npion scattering in the exploration of the nucleon excitation spectrum. Higher\nmass states often decouple from the $N\\pi$ channel and are not seen in $\\pi N\n\\to \\pi N$. Photoproduction of mesons, such as $K\\Lambda$, $\\omega p$ and\n$\\eta^\\prime p$ may be more sensitive to many of these states. The CLAS\ndetector, combined with the use of energy-tagged polarized photons and\npolarized electrons, as well as polarized targets and the measurement of recoil\npolarization, are the tools needed for a comprehensive nucleon resonance\nprogram. Some of the recently published high statistics data sets had\nsignificant impact on further clarifying the nucleon excitation spectrum.\n", "  Most of the mass of everyday objects resides in atomic nuclei; the total of\nthe electrons' mass adds up to less than one part in a thousand. The nuclei are\ncomposed of nucleons---protons and neutrons---whose nuclear binding energy,\nthough tremendous on a human scale, is small compared to their rest energy. The\nnucleons are, in turn, composites of massless gluons and nearly massless\nquarks. It is the energy of these confined objects, via $M=E/c^2$, that is\nresponsible for everyday mass. This article discusses the physics of this\nmechanism and the role of lattice gauge theory in establishing its connection\nto quantum chromodynamics.\n", "  Triblock terpolymers exhibit a rich self-organization behavior including the\nformation of fascinating cylindrical core-shell structures with a phase\nseparated corona. After crystallization-induced self-assembly of\npolystryrene-(block)-polyethylene-(block)-poly(methyl methacrylate) triblock\nterpolymers (abbreviated as SEMs = Styrene-Ethylene-Methacrylates) from\nsolution, worm-like core-shell micelles with a patchy corona of polystryrene\nand poly(methyl methacrylate) were observed by transmission electron\nmicroscopy. However, the solution structure is still a matter of debate. Here,\nwe present a method to distinguish in-situ between a Janus-type (two faced) and\na patchy (multiple compartments) configuration of the corona. To discriminate\nbetween both models the scattering intensity must be determined mainly by one\ncorona compartment. Contrast variation in small-angle neutron scattering\nenables us to focus on one compartment of the SEMs. The results validate the\nexistence of the patchy structure also in solution.\n", "  The availaible data on the D0 to K0S pi+ pi- decays are analysed in the\nframework of the quasi two-body QCD factorization approximation. The\nannihilation, via W-exchange, amplitudes are added to the weak-decay tree\namplitudes. The doubly Cabibbo suppressed parts of the amplitudes are also\nconsidered. The strong interactions between the kaon-pion and pion-pion pairs\nin the S-, P- and D-final states are described in terms of the corresponding\nform factors. The kaon-pion or pion-pion scalar and vector form factors are\nconstrained by other experimental data. Unitarity, analyticity and chiral\nsymmetry are also used to obtain their functional forms. We go through a\nminimization procedure to reproduce the K0S pi-, K0S pi+ and pi+ pi- effective\nmass projections of the Dalitz plot distributions. The large number (27) of\nnon-zero amplitudes leads to a large number of parameters. The resulting model\ndistributions and branching fractions are compared to the accurate Belle\nCollaboration data.\n", "  Pair correlations are described in the framework of the HFB approximation\napplied to a uniformly rotating system (Cranking model). The reduction of the\nmoments of inertia, the classification of rotational bands as multi\nquasiparticle configurations, and the signatures of the rotation induced\ntransition to the unpaired state are discussed.\n", "  In this work we present the preliminary results of the analysis of the pp->pp\neta(->pp pi(+)pi(-)pi(0) reaction aiming to test the charge conjugation\nsymmetry C in strong interactions. Based on approximately $10^5$ identified\neta->pi(+)pi(-)pi(0) decay events we have extracted asymmetry parameters\nsensitive to C symmetry violation for different isospin values of the final\nstate and we have established that all are consistent with zero within the\nobtained accuracy.\n", "  The electromagnetic structure of the pseudoscalar meson nonet is completely\ndescribed by the sophisticated Unitary&Analytic model, respecting all known\ntheoretical properties of the corresponding form factors.\n", "  Open chaotic systems are expected to possess universal transport statistics\nand recently there have been many advances in understanding and obtaining\nexpressions for their transport moments. However when tunnel barriers are\nadded, which represents the situation in more general experimental physical\nsystems much less is known about the behaviour of the moments. By incorporating\ntunnel barriers in the recursive semiclassical diagrammatic approach we obtain\nthe moment generating function of the transmission eigenvalues at leading and\nsubleading order. For reflection quantities quantum mechanical tunneling phases\nplay an essential role and we introduce new structures to deal with them. This\nallows us to obtain the moment generating function of the reflection\neigenvalues and the Wigner delay times at leading order. Our semiclassical\nresults are in complementary regimes to the leading order results derived from\nrandom matrix theory expanding the range of theoretically known moments. As a\nfurther application we derive to leading order the density of states of Andreev\nbilliards coupled to a superconductor through tunnel barriers.\n", "  The melting point of ice Ih, as well as the temperature of maximum density\n(TMD) in the liquid phase, has been computed using the path integral Monte\nCarlo method. Two new models are introduced; TIP4PQ_D2O and TIP4PQ_T2O which\nare specifically designed to study D2O and T2O respectively. We have also used\nthese models to study the \"competing quantum effects\" proposal of Habershon,\nMarkland and Manolopoulos; the TIP4PQ/2005, TIP4PQ/2005 (D2O) and TIP4PQ/2005\n(T2O) models are able to study the isotopic substitution of hydrogen for\ndeuterium or tritium whilst constraining the geometry, while the TIP4PQ_D2O and\nTIP4PQ_T2O models, where the O-H bond lengths are progressively shortened,\npermit the study of the influence of geometry (and thus dipole moment) on the\nisotopic effects. For TIP4PQ_D2O - TIP4PQ/2005 we found a melting point shift\nof 4.9 K (experimentally the value is 3.68K) and a TMD shift of 6K\n(experimentally 7.2K). For TIP4PQ_T2O - TIP4PQ/2005 we found a melting point\nshift of 5.2 K (experimentally the value is 4.49K) and a TMD shift of 7K\n(experimentally 9.4K).\n", "  We report on new Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations of\nSNR J0519-6902. The Supernova Remnant (SNR) is small in size (~8 pc) and\nexhibits a typical SNR spectrum of alpha = -0.53 +- 0.07, with steeper spectral\nindices found towards the northern limb of the remnant. SNR J0519-6902 contains\na low level of radially orientated polarisation at wavelengths of 3 & 6 cm,\nwhich is characteristic of younger SNRs. A fairly strong magnetic field was\nestimated of ~171 microG. The remnant appears to be the result of a typical\nType Ia supernovae, sharing many properties as another small and young Type Ia\nLMC SNR, J0509-6731.\n", "  We present a method for the production of segmented optics. It is a novel\nprocessing developed at INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera (INAF-OAB)\nemploying commercial of-the-shelf materials. It is based on the shaping of thin\nglass foils by means of forced bending, this occurring at room temperature\n(cold-shaping). The glass is then assembled into a sandwich structure for\nretaining the imposed shape. The principal mechanical features of the mirrors\nare the very low weight, rigidity and environmental robustness. The cost and\nproduction time also turns to be very competitive. In this paper we sum up the\nresults achieved during the r&d performed in the past years. We have\ninvestigated the theoretical limits of the structural components by means of\nparametric finite elements analyses; we also discuss the effects caused by the\nmost common structural loads. Finally, the process implementation, the more\nsignificant validation tests and the mass production at the industry is\ndescribed.\n", "  This paper starts with a brief historical overview of pairing in nuclei,\nwhich fulfills the purpose of properly framing the main subject. This concerns\nthe pairing properties of a realistic shell-model effective interaction which\nhas proved very successful in describing nuclei around doubly magic 132Sn. We\nfocus attention on the two nuclei 134Te and 134Sn with two valence protons and\nneutrons, respectively. Our study brings out the key role of one particle-one\nhole excitations in producing a significant difference between proton and\nneutron pairing in this region.\n", "  Collisions between $^{248}$Cm and $^{48}$Ca are systematically investigated\nby time-dependent density functional calculations with evaporation\nprescription. Depending on the incident energy and impact parameter, fusion,\ndeep-inelastic and fission events are expected to appear. In this paper, a\nmicroscopic method of calculating the fissibility of compound nuclei is\npresented.\n", "  We summarize the current status on constraining the density dependence of the\nsymmetry energy from terrestrial laboratory measurements and astrophysical\nobservations. While the value $E_{sym}({\\rho_{0}})$ and density slope $L$ of\nthe symmetry energy at saturation density $\\rho_{0}$ can vary largely depending\non the data or methods, all the existing constraints are essentially consistent\nwith $E_{sym}({\\rho_{0}}) = 31 \\pm 2$ MeV and $L = 50 \\pm 20$ MeV. The\ndetermination of the supra-saturation density behavior of the symmetry energy\nremains a big challenge.\n", "  We discuss, how planned measurements at KLOE-2 of the (pi^0 -> gamma gamma)\ndecay width and the (gamma^* gamma -> pi^0) transition form factor can improve\nestimates for the numerically dominant pion-exchange contribution to hadronic\nlight-by-light scattering in the muon g-2 and what are the limitations related\nto the modelling of the off-shellness of the pion.\n", "  Nuclear physics tests of parity- and time-reversal invariance have both\nshaped the development of the Standard Model and provided key tests of its\npredictions. These studies now provide vital input in the search for physics\nbeyond the Standard Model. We give a brief review of a few key experimental and\ntheoretical developments in the history of this sub-field of nuclear physics as\nwell as a short outlook, focusing on weak decays, parity-violation in electron\nscattering, and searches for permanent electric dipole moments of the neutron\nand neutral atoms.\n", "  Great strides have been made in the understanding of bound states of a bottom\nquark $b$ and its antiquark $\\bar b$ since the discovery of the first\n$\\Upsilon$ resonances in 1977. These {\\it bottomonium} bound states have a rich\nspectrum whose masses and transition amplitudes shed valuable light on the\nstrong interactions. The present article reviews some recent developments in\nbottomonium physics. These include the discovery of the spin-singlet states\n$\\eta_b$ and $h_b$, the first D-wave states, one or more candidates for\nspin-triplet $\\chi_b(3P)$ excitations, and above-threshold states with strong\ntransitions to states below threshold. Information on transitions, production,\nand signatures of new physics is also presented.\n", "  In the paper, we tackle the following questions: Could the difficulty in\nsolving the Schrodinger equation for an arbitrarily large system be a\nreflection of some nature intrinsic property? And if so, could this difficulty\nbe a resolution to the measurement problem?\n", "  I attempt to experimentally evaluate the prospects of synthesizing new\nneutron- rich superheavy nuclei. I consider three possible synthetic paths to\nneutron- rich superheavy nuclei: (a) the use of neutron-rich radioactive beams.\n(b) the use of damped collisions and (c) the use of multi-nucleon transfer\nreactions. I consider the prospects of synthesizing new n-rich isotopes of\nRf-Bh using light n-rich radioactive beams and targeted beams from ReA3, FRIB\nand SPIRAL2. For the damped collision path, I present the results of a study of\na surrogate reaction, 160Gd + 186W. These data indicate the formation of Au\n(trans-target) fragments and the depletion of yields of target-like fragments\nby fission and fragment emission. The data are compared to predictions of\nZagrebaev and Greiner. For the multi-nucleon transfer reactions, the results of\na study of the 136Xe + 208Pb reaction are discussed. I consider the possibility\nof multi-nucleon transfer reactions with radioactive beams.\n", "  We present a measurement of the Schr\\\"odinger Functional running coupling in\nSU(2) lattice gauge theory with adjoint fermions. We use HEX smearing and\nclover improvement to reduce the discretization effects. We obtain a robust\ncontinuum limit for the step scaling, which confirms the existence of a\nnon-trivial fixed point.\n", "  We present the report of the LatKMI collaboration on the lattice QCD\nsimulation for the cases of 4 and 8 flavors. The Nf=8 in particular is\ninteresting from the model-building point of view: The typical walking\ntechnicolor model with the large anomalous dimension is the so-called\none-family model (Farhi-Susskind model). Thus we explore the walking behavior\nin LQCD with 8 HISQ quarks by comparing with the 4-flavor case (in which the\nchiral symmetry is spontaneously broken). We report preliminary results on the\nspectrum, analyzed through the chiral perturbation theory and the finite-size\nhyperscaling, and we discuss the availability of the Nf=8 QCD to the\nphenomenology.\n", "  We propose the segmented Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT/GTM),as the largest\nspatial light modulator capable of producing vortex beams of integer\ntopological charge. This observing mode could be applied for direct exoplanet\nsearches in the millimeter or submillimeter regimes. We studied the stability\nof the vortex structure against aberrations and diffraction effects inherent to\nthe size and segmented nature of the collector mirror. In the presence of low\norder aberrations the focal distribution of the system remains stable. Our\nresults show that these effects depend on the topological charge of the vortex\nand the relative orientation of the aberration with respect to the antenna\naxis. Coma and defocus show no large effects in the image at the focal plane,\nnevertheless the system is very sensitive to astigmatism. Heat turbulence,\nsimulated by random aberrations, shows that the system behaves in a similar way\nas astigmatism dissociating the vortices. We propose the Segmented Vortex\nTelescope as a novel approach for the detection of giant planets outside\ncircumstellar disks around nearby stars. Since our results are applicable to\nother facilities with segmented surfaces, we suggest that this idea should be\nconsidered as a regular observation mode complementary to interferometric\nmethods.\n", "  The yrast states of even even vibrational and transitional nuclei are\ninterpreted as a rotating condensate of interacting d-bosons. The corresponding\nsemi-classical tidal wave concept is used for microscopic calculations of\nenergies and E2 transition probabilities. The strong octupole correlations in\nthe light rare earth and actinide nuclides are interpreted as rotation-induced\ncondensation of interacting f-bosons.\n", "  By analyzing an exactly solvable model in the second quantized formulation\nwhich allows a unified treatment of adiabatic and non-adiabatic geometric\nphases, it is shown that the topology of the adiabatic Berry's phase, which is\ncharacterized by the singularity associated with possible level crossing, is\ntrivial in a precise sense. This topology of the geometric phase is quite\ndifferent from the topology of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, where the topology is\nspecified by the external local gauge field and it is exact for the slow as\nwell as for the fast motion of the electron.\n", "  Recent highlights from Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are reviewed and discussed in the context of the\ndiscovery of the strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP) at RHIC in 2005\nas confirmed by results from the CERN-LHC Pb+Pb program. Outstanding RHIC\nmachine operation in 2012 with 3-dimensional stochastic cooling and a new EBIS\nion source enabled measurements with Cu+Au, U+U, for which multiplicity\ndistributions are shown, as well as with polarized p-p collisions. Differences\nof the physics and goals of p-p versus A+A are discussed leading to a review of\nRHIC results on pi0 suppression in Au+Au collisions and comparison to LHC Pb+Pb\nresults in the same range 5<pT<20 GeV. Results of the RHIC Au+Au energy scan\nshow that high pT suppression takes over from the \"Cronin Effect\" for c.m.\nenergies > 30 GeV. Improved measurements of direct photon production and\ncorrelation with charged particles at RHIC are shown, including the absence of\na low pT (thermal) photon enhancement in d+Au collisions. Attempts to\nunderstand the apparent equality of the energy loss of light and heavy quarks\nin the QGP by means of direct measurements of charm and beauty particles at\nboth RHIC and LHC are discussed.\n", "  The electric dipole (E1) strength functions have been systematically\ncalculated based on the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), using\nthe finite amplitude method and the real-time approach to the TDDFT with\npairing correlations. The low-energy E1 strengths in neutron-rich isotopes show\npeculiar behaviors, such as sudden enhancement and reduction, as functions of\nthe neutron numbers.They seem to be due to the interplay between the neutron\nshell effect and the deformation effect.\n", "  This manuscript addresses selected aspects of computing for the\nreconstruction and simulation of particle interactions in subnuclear physics.\nBased on personal experience with experiments at DESY and at CERN, I cover the\nevolution of computing hardware and software from the era of track chambers\nwhere interactions were recorded on photographic film up to the LHC experiments\nwith their multi-million electronic channels.\n", "  The LatKMI collaboration is studying systematically the dynamical properties\nof N_f = 4,8,12,16 SU(3) gauge theories using lattice simulations with (HISQ)\nstaggered fermions. Exploring the spectrum of many-flavour QCD, and its scaling\nnear the chiral limit, is mandatory in order to establish if one of these\nmodels realises the Walking Technicolor scenario. Although lattice technologies\nto study the mesonic spectrum are well developed, scalar flavour-singlet states\nstill require extra effort to be determined. In addition, gluonic observables\nusually require large-statistic simulations and powerful noise-reduction\ntechniques. In the following, we present useful spectroscopic methods to\ninvestigate scalar glueballs and scalar flavour-singlet mesons, together with\nthe current status of the scalar spectrum in N_f = 12 QCD from the LatKMI\ncollaboration.\n", "  The nucleus of the eukaryotic cell functions amidst active cytoskeletal\nfilaments, but its response to the stresses carried by these filaments is\nlargely unexplored. We report here the results of studies of the translational\nand rotational dynamics of the nuclei of single fibroblast cells, with the\neffects of cell migration suppressed by plating onto fibronectin-coated\nmicro-fabricated patterns. Patterns of the same area but different shapes\nand/or aspect ratio were used to study the effect of cell geometry on the\ndynamics. On circles, squares and equilateral triangles, the nucleus undergoes\npersistent rotational motion, while on high-aspect-ratio rectangles of the same\narea it moves only back and forth. The circle and the triangle showed\nrespectively the largest and the smallest angular speed. We show that our\nobservations can be understood through a hydrodynamic approach in which the\nnucleus is treated as a highly viscous inclusion residing in a less viscous\nfluid of orientable filaments endowed with active stresses. Lowering actin\ncontractility selectively by introducing blebbistatin at low concentrations\ndrastically reduced the speed and persistence time of the angular motion of the\nnucleus. Time-lapse imaging of actin revealed a correlated hydrodynamic flow\naround the nucleus, with profile and magnitude consistent with the results of\nour theoretical approach. Coherent intracellular flows and consequent nuclear\nrotation thus appear to be a generic property that cells must balance by\nspecific mechanisms in order to maintain nuclear homeostasis.\n", "  New types of confinement phase emerge as singular SCFT's appearing as\ninfrared-fixed-points of N=2 supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) are perturbed by an N=1\nadjoint mass term. Based on a recent remarkable work on infrared-fixed-point\nSCFT of highest criticalities by Gaiotto, Seiberg and Tachikawa, we discuss\nphysics of certain confining systems in SU(N), USp(2N) or SO(N) gauge theories.\nThese show features different from a straightforward dual superconductivity\npicture of confinement a' la 't Hooft and Mandelstam, which might suggest a new\nvenue in exploring the quark confinement mechanism in the real-world QCD.\n", "  These lectures from the TASI 2012 summer school outline the basics of\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) in 3+1 dimensions. Starting from a ground-up development\nof superspace, we develop all of the tools necessary to construct SUSY\nlagrangians. While aimed at an introductory level, these lectures incorporate a\nnumber of \"super-tricks\" for SUSY aficionados, including SUSY-covariant\nderivatives, equations of motion in superspace, background field methods, and\nnon-linear realizations of goldstinos.\n", "  The PREX experiment at Jefferson Laboratory measures the neutron radius of\n208Pb with parity violating electron scattering in a way that is free from most\nstrong interaction uncertainties. The 208Pb radius has important implications\nfor neutron rich matter and the structure of neutron stars. We present first\nPREX results, describe future plans, and discuss a follow on measurement of the\nneutron radius of 48Ca. We review radio and X-ray observations of neutron star\nmasses and radii. These constrain the equation of state (pressure versus\ndensity) of neutron rich matter. We present a new energy functional that is\nsimultaneously fit to both nuclear and neutron star properties. In this\napproach, neutron star masses and radii constrain the energy of neutron matter.\nThis avoids having to rely on model dependent microscopic calculations of\nneutron matter. The functional is then used to predict the location of the drip\nlines and the properties of very neutron rich heavy nuclei.\n", "  We have performed self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov calculations\nfor nuclei close to $^{254}$No. Self-consistent deformations, including\n$\\beta_{2,4,6,8}$ as functions of the rotational frequency, were determined for\neven-even nuclei $^{246,248,250}$Fm, $^{252,254}$No, and $^{256}$Rf. The\nquasiparticle spectra for N=151 isotones and Z=99 isotopes were calculated and\ncompared with experimental data and the results of Woods-Saxon calculations. We\nfound that our calculations give high-order deformations similar to those\nobtained for the Woods-Saxon potential, and that the experimental quasiparticle\nenergies are reasonably well reproduced.\n", "  Point pattern sets arise in many different areas of physical, biological, and\napplied research, representing many random realizations of underlying pattern\nformation mechanisms. These pattern sets can be heterogeneous with respect to\nunderlying spatial processes, which may not be visually distinguishable. This\nheterogeneity can be elucidated by looking at statistical measures of the\npatterns sets and using these measures to divide the pattern set into distinct\ngroups representing like spatial processes. We introduce here a numerical\nprocedure for sorting point pattern sets into spatially homogeneous groups\nusing Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) applied to the\napproximated Minkowski functionals of each pattern. We demonstrate that this\nprocedure correctly sorts pattern sets into similar groups both when the\npatterns are drawn from similar processes and when the 2nd-order\ncharacteristics of the pattern are identical. We highlight this routine for\ndistinguishing the molecular patterning of fluorescently labeled cell membrane\nproteins, a subject of much interest in studies investigating complex spatial\nsignaling patterns involved in the human immune response.\n", "  These lectures were presented at the TASI 2012 summer school to a mixture of\ngraduate students in particle theory and cosmology. They serve as an elementary\nintroduction to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and discuss\nthe implications of a 125 GeV Higgs boson for this theory. Some familiarity\nwith the Standard Model is assumed.\n", "  The current status of the application of covariant density functional theory\nto the description of fission barriers in actinides and superheavy nuclei is\nreviewed. The achievements and open problems are discussed.\n", "  We derive the quantum dynamics of heavy quark systems in quark-gluon plasma\nas open quantum systems. The scatterings of a heavy quark with the hard medium\nparticles give rise to Debye screened QCD force and drag force and its\nfluctuation. We present a unified quantum description of these in-medium QCD\nforces at high temperature in the leading-order perturbation on the basis of\nthe influence functional formalism.\n", "  Bose-Einstein condensates of dilute gases are well-suited for investigations\nof vortex dynamics and turbulence in quantum fluids, yet there has been little\nexperimental research into the approaches that may be most promising for\ngenerating states of two-dimensional turbulence in these systems. Here we give\nan overview of techniques for generating the large and disordered vortex\ndistributions associated with two-dimensional quantum turbulence. We focus on\ndescribing methods explored in our Bose-Einstein condensation laboratory, and\ndiscuss the suitability of these methods for studying various aspects of\ntwo-dimensional quantum turbulence. We also summarize some of the open\nquestions regarding our own understanding of these mechanisms of\ntwo-dimensional quantum turbulence generation in condensates. We find that\nwhile these disordered distributions of vortices can be generated by a variety\nof techniques, further investigation is needed to identify methods for\nobtaining quasi-steady-state quantum turbulence in condensates.\n", "  The only experimentally observed phenomenon that lies outside the standard\nmodel of the electroweak interaction is neutrino oscillations. A way to try to\nunify the extensive neutrino oscillation data is to add a phenomenological mass\nterm to the Lagrangian that is not diagonal in the flavor basis. The goal is\nthen to understand the world's data in terms of the parameters of the mixing\nmatrix and the differences between the squares of the masses of the neutrinos.\nAn outstanding question is what is the correct ordering of the masses, the\nhierarchy question. We point out a broken symmetry relevant to this question,\nthe symmetry of the simultaneous interchange of hierarchy and the sign of\n$\\theta_{13}$. We first present the results of an analysis of data that well\ndetermine the phenomenological parameters but are not sensitive to the\nhierarchy. We find $\\theta_{13} = 0.152\\pm 0.014$, $\\theta_{23} =\n0.25^{+0.03}_{-0.05} \\pi$ and $\\Delta_{32} = 2.45\\pm 0.14 \\times 10^{-3}$\neV$^2$, results consistent with others. We then include data that are sensitive\nto the hierarchy and the sign of $\\theta_{13}$. We find, unlike others, four\nisolated minimum in the $\\chi^2$-space as predicted by the symmetry. Now that\nDaya Bay and RENO have determined $\\theta_{13}$ to be surprisingly large, the\nSuper-K atmospheric data produce meaningful symmetry breaking such that the\ninverse hierarchy is preferred at the 97.2 % level.\n", "  A Monte Carlo code based on Geant 3.21 has been used for simulations of\nenergy losses and angular scattering in a time-of-flight Suprathermal Ion\nTelescope (SIT) on the Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). A\nhemispherical isotropic particle distribution, a monoenergetic or power law in\nenergy is used in these simulations. The impact of scattering, energy losses\nand system noise on the instrument mass resolution is discussed.\n", "  We present the mechanism of the dynamical supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking at\nthe metastable vacuum in the N=1 U(N) SUSY gauge theory with adjoint\nsuperfields. The dynamical SUSY breaking is triggered by the non-vanishing\nD-term coupled to the observable sector, and is realized by the self-consistent\nHartree-Fock approximation of the NJL type while it eventually brings us the\nnon-vanishing F-term as well. We numerically check the local stability of our\nmetastable vacuum.\n", "  We discuss a model which involves the top quark condensation and the walking\ntechnicolor. We focus on the scalar boson in such a model from the viewpoint of\nthe observed scalar boson at the LHC.\n", "  We present a brief overview of our recent lattice studies of SU(3) gauge\ntheory with N_f = 8 and 12 fundamental fermions, including some new and\nyet-unpublished results.\n  To explore relatively unfamiliar systems beyond lattice QCD, we carry out a\nwide variety of investigations with the goal of synthesizing the results to\nbetter understand the non-perturbative dynamics of these systems.\n  All our findings are consistent with conformal infrared dynamics in the\n12-flavor system, but with 8 flavors we observe puzzling behavior that requires\nfurther investigation.\n  Our new Monte Carlo renormalization group technique exploits the Wilson flow\nto obtain more direct predictions of a 12-flavor IR fixed point.\n  Studies of N_f = 12 bulk and finite-temperature transitions also indicate IR\nconformality, while our current results for the 8-flavor phase diagram do not\nyet provide clear signs of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.\n  From the Dirac eigenvalue spectrum we extract the mass anomalous dimension\ngamma_m, and predict gamma*_m = 0.32(3) at the 12-flavor fixed point.\n  The N_f = 8 system again shows interesting behavior, with a large anomalous\ndimension across a wide range of energy scales.\n  We use the eigenvalue density to predict the chiral condensate, and compare\nthis approach with direct and partially-quenched measurements.\n", "  This talk discusses the possibility of new physics within the strong gauge\ninteractions, specifically the idea of an extended color gauge group that is\nspontaneously broken to QCD. After a brief review of the literature, three of\nour recent pieces of work on coloron phenomenology are summarized. First, some\nkey results on coloron production to NLO at hadron colliders are described.\nNext, a method of using associated production of colorons and weak vector\nbosons to better determine coloron couplings is discussed. Finally, a new model\nthat naturally realizes flavor physics is reviewed.\n", "  Baryonic matter is studied in the Skyrme model by taking into account the\nroles of $\\pi,$ $\\rho$, and $\\omega$ mesons through the hidden local symmetry\nup to $\\mathcal{O}(p^4)$ terms including the homogeneous Wess-Zumino (hWZ)\nterms. Using the master formulas for the low energy constants derived from\nholographic QCD models the skyrmion matter properties can be quantitatively\ncalculated with the input values of the pion decay constant $f_\\pi$ and the\nvector meson mass $m_\\rho^{}$. We find that the hWZ terms are responsible for\nthe repulsive interactions of the $\\omega$ meson. In addition, the\nself-consistently included $\\mathcal{O}(p^4)$ terms with the hWZ terms is found\nto increase the half skyrmion phase transition point above the normal nucleon\ndensity.\n", "  The discovery of the Higgs particle at around 126 GeV has given us a big hint\ntowards the origin of the Higgs potential. The running quartic self-coupling\ndecreases and crosses zero somewhere in the very high energy scale. It is\nusually considered as a signal of the instability of the standard model (SM)\nvacuum, but it can also indicate a link between the physics in the electroweak\nscale and the Planck scale. Furthermore, the LHC experiments as well as the\nflavor physics experiments give strong constraints on the physics beyond the\nSM. It urges us to reconsider the widely taken approach to the physics beyond\nthe SM (BSM), namely the approach based on the gauge unification below the\nPlanck scale and the resulting hierarchy problem. Motivated by the recent\nexperiments, we first revisit the hierarchy problem and consider an alternative\nappoach based on a classical conformality of the SM without the Higgs mass\nterm.\n  In this talk, I review our recent proposal of a B-L extension of the SM with\na flat Higgs potential at the Planck scale. This model can be an alternative\nsolution to the hierarchy problem as well as being phenomenologically viable to\nexplain the neutrino oscillations and the baryon asymmetry of the universe.\nWith an assumption that the Higgs has a flat potential at the Planck scale, we\nshow that the B-L symmetry is radiatively broken at the TeV scale via the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism, and it triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking\nthrough a radiatively generated scalar mixing. The ratio of these two breaking\nscales is dynamically determined by the B-L gauge coupling.\n", "  With a substantial amount of simulations, we have explored the system across\na wide range of lattice scales. We have located a lattice artifact, first order\nbulk transition, have studied its properties, and found that the flavor-singlet\nscalar meson mass vanishes at the critical endpoint. We will discuss the\nlattice phase diagrams and the continuum limits for both a spontaneous chiral\nsymmetry breaking phase and an infrared conformal phase, and compare results\nwith other groups.\n", "  We study the mechanics of pressurized graphene membranes using an\nexperimental configuration that allows the determination of the elasticity of\ngraphene and the adhesion energy between a substrate and a graphene (or other\ntwo-dimensional solid) membrane. The test consists of a monolayer graphene\nmembrane adhered to a substrate by surface forces. The substrate is patterned\nwith etched microcavities of a prescribed volume and when they are covered with\nthe graphene monolayer it traps a fixed number (N) of gas molecules in the\nmicrochamber. By lowering the ambient pressure, and thus changing the pressure\ndifference across the graphene membrane, the membrane can be made to bulge and\ndelaminate in a stable manner from the substrate. Here we describe the analysis\nof the membrane/substrate as a thermodynamic system and explore the behavior of\nthe system over representative experimentally-accessible geometry and loading\nparameters. We carry out companion experiments and compare them to the\ntheoretical predictions and then use the theory and experiments together to\ndetermine the adhesion energy of graphene/SiO2 interfaces. We find an average\nadhesion energy of 0.24 J/m2 which is lower, but in line with our previously\nreported values. We assert that this test, which we call the constant N blister\ntest, is a valuable approach to determine the adhesion energy between\ntwo-dimensional solid membranes and a substrate, which is an important, but not\nwell-understood aspect of behavior. The test also provides valuable information\nthat can serve as the basis for subsequent research to understand the\nmechanisms contributing to the observed adhesion energy. Finally, we show how\nin the limit of a large microcavity, the constant N test approaches the\nbehavior observed in a constant pressure blister test and we provide an\nexperimental observation that suggests this behavior.\n", "  A structure of germanium selenide glasses is simulated by the featured\nclusters built from the tetrahedral GeSe4 units up to the clusters with six\ngermanium atoms (Ge6Se16H4 and Ge6Se16H8). Quantum chemical calculations at the\nDFT level with effective core potentials for Ge and Se atoms for the clusters\nof different composition reveal their relative stability and optical\nproperties.\n", "  In realistic technicolor models containing many fermions, the electroweak\nbaryogenesis offers a natural scenario for generating baryon number asymmetry.\nOne of the key ingredients is the occurrence of the first order phase\ntransition at finite temperature. As a first step toward the exploration of\nthis possibility on the lattice, we develop an agile method to identify the\ncritical mass for a given Nf, separating the first order and the crossover\ntransition. We explain the outline of our method and demonstrate it by\ndetermining the critical mass of Nf-flavors in the presence of light\ntwo-flavors. It is found that the critical mass becomes larger with Nf.\n", "  We propose a new iterative method to directly calculate the spontaneous mass\ngeneration due to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. We can conclude the\nphysical mass definitely without recourse to any other consideration like the\nfree energy comparison.\n", "  We propose quite a new method of analyzing the dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking in gauge theories. Starting with the non-perturbative renormalization\ngroup equation for the Wilsonian fermion potential, we define the weak solution\nof it in order to mathematically authorize solutions with singularity. The weak\nsolution is obtained uniquely and it successfully predicts the physically\ncorrect vacuum, chiral condensates, dynamical mass, through its\nauto-convexizing power for the effective potential. Thus it works perfectly\neven for the first order phase transition in the finite density QCD.\n", "  We review the evolution of the studies of diffractive processes in the strong\ninteraction over the last 60 years. First, we briefly outline the early\ndevelopments of the theory based on analyticity and unitarity of the S-matrix,\nincluding the derivation and exploration of the Regge trajectories and related\nmoving cuts. Special attention is paid to the concept of the Pomeron trajectory\nintroduced for description of total, elastic and diffractive cross sections at\nhigh energies and to the emergence of the dynamics of multi-Pomeron\ninteractions.The role of large longitudinal distances and color coherent\nphenomena for the understanding of inelastic diffraction in hadron-hadron\nscattering and deep inelastic scattering is emphasized. The connection of these\nphenomena to the cancellation of the contribution of the Glauber approximation\nin hadron-nucleus collisions and to the understanding of the Gribov-Glauber\napproximation is explained. The presence of different scales in perturbative\nQCD due to masses of heavy quarks has led to the emergence of numerous new\nphenomena including non-universality of the slopes of Regge trajectories made\nof light and heavy quarks and non-universal energy dependence of elastic cross\nsections. The application of the perturbative QCD techniques allowed us to\ncalculate from the first principles the interaction of small transverse size\ncolor singlets with hadrons leading to the development of the quantitative\ntheory of hard exclusive reactions and to the successful prediction of many\nregularities in hard large mass diffraction. It also led to the prediction of\nthe phenomenon of complete transparency of nuclear matter in QCD in special\nprocesses. The conflict of perturbative QCD with probability conservation for\nhigh energy processes of virtual photon-nucleon scattering is explained. Some\nproperties of the new QCD regime are outlined.\n", "  We have investigated a flavour model [1] which inspired by small squared-mass\ndifference measured in solar neutrino oscillation experiments and observability\nin neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. In our model, the $1^{\\rm st.}$\nand $2^{\\rm nd.}$ generations of fermions have a common mass at the leading\norder. Such limit may be a good starting point from the points of view of\nunderstanding the mixing patterns and mass spectra. In this limit, the mass\nmatrices are respected an $O (2)$ symmetry on flavor space of the first two\ngenerations. For simplicity, we propose a model for lepton sector based on the\n$D_N$ group which is a discrete subgroup of $O (2)$. We show that our model can\nreproduce the experimental data without hierarchical couplings except for $5\n\\mathchar`- 10%$ tuning partially for the large neutrino mixing. Further, we\nshow a novel relation between the tiny electron mass and the relatively large\n$\\theta_{13}^{\\rm PMNS}$ via CP violation by the complex vacuum expectation\nvalues of the extra scalar fields.\n", "  The generalization of Einstein's special theory of relativity (SRT) is\nproposed. In this model the possibility of unification of scalar gravity and\nelectromagnetism into a single united field is considered. Formally, the\ngeneralization of the SRT is that instead of (1+3)-dimensional Minkowski space\nthe (1+4)-dimensional extension G is considered. As a fifth additional\ncoordinate the interval S is used. This value is saved under the usual Lorentz\ntransformations in Minkowski space M, but it changes when the transformations\nin the extended space G are used. We call this model the extended space model\n(ESM). From a physical point of view our expansion means that processes in\nwhich the rest mass of the particles changes are acceptable now. If the rest\nmass of a particle does not change and the physical quantities do not depend on\nan additional variable S, then the electromagnetic and gravitational fields\nexist independently of each other. But if the rest mass is variable and there\nis a dependence on S, then these two fields are combined into a single united\nfield. In the extended space model a photon can have a nonzero mass and this\nmass can be either positive or negative. The gravitational effects such as the\nspeed of escape, gravitational red shift and deflection of light can be\nanalyzed in the frame of the extended space model. In this model all these\ngravitational effects can be found algebraically by the rotations in the (1+4)\ndimensional space. Now it becomes possible to predict some future results of\nvisible size of super massive objects in our Universe due to new stage of\nexperimental astronomy development in the Radio Astron Project and analyze\nphenomena of the star V838 Monocerotis explosion as possible Local Big Bang\n(LBB).\n", "  The technidilaton (TD) is a composite scalar predicted in walking technicolor\n(WTC), arising as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the\nspontaneous breaking of the approximate scale invariance. Due to the\nNambu-Goldstone boson's nature, the TD can be as light as the LHC boson that\nhas been discovered at around 125 GeV. We discuss the size of the TD mass and\nthe coupling properties relevant to the LHC study. It turns out that the TD\ncouplings to the standard model (SM) particles take the same form as those of\nthe SM Higgs boson, except the essentially distinguishable two ingredients: i)\nthe overall coupling strengths set by the decay constant related to the\nspontaneous breaking of the scale invariance, which is in general not equal to\nthe electroweak scale; ii) the couplings to photons and gluons which can\ninclude extra contributions from technifermion loops and hence can be enhanced\ncompared to the SM Higgs case. To be concrete, we take the one-family\ntechnicolor model to explore the TD LHC phenomenology at 125 GeV. It is shown\nthat the TD gives the signal consistent with the currently reported LHC data,\nnotably can explain the excess in the diphoton channel, due to the extra\ncontributions to digluon and diphoton couplings coming from the one-family\ntechnifermion loops.\n", "  The method of non-perturbative renormalization group (NPRG) is applied to the\nanalysis of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) in QCD. We show that the\nDCSB solution of the NPRG flow equation can be obtained without the\nbosonization. The solution, having the singular point, can be authorized as the\nweak solution of partial differential equation, and can be easily evaluated\nusing the method of the characteristic curve. Also we show that our non-ladder\nextended approximation improves almost perfectly the gauge dependence of the\nchiral condensates.\n", "  We discuss the role of dilaton, which is supposed to be representing a\nspecial feature of scale symmetry of QCD, trace anomaly, in dense baryonic\nmatter. The idea that the scale symmetry breaking of QCD is responsible for the\nspontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is presented along the similar spirit\nof Freund-Nambu model. The incorporation of dilaton field in the hidden local\nsymmetric parity doublet model is briefly sketched with the possible role of\ndilaton at high density baryonic matter, the emergence of linear sigma model in\ndilaton limit.\n", "  In this talk I argue that a light techni-dilaton exists in models of walking\ntechnicolor near the conformal window. The light techni-dilaton then mixes with\nthe composite Higgs, which is predicted to be narrow and light in walking\ntechnicolor models. It is an interesting possibility that the newly discovered\nboson at LHC might be a mixed state of techni-dilaton and the composite Higgs.\n", "  We study the tripartite entanglement for a class of mixed states defined by\nthe mixture of GHZ and W states, \\rho=p|GHZ><GHZ|+(1-p)|W><W|. Based on the\nCaratheodory theorem and the periodicity assumption, the possible optimal\ndecomposition of the states has been derived, which is not independent on the\ndetailed measure of entanglement. We find that, according to p, there are two\ndifferent decompositions containing 3 or 4 quantum states in the decomposition\nrespectively. When the decomposition contains 3 quantum states, the tripartite\nentanglement of the mixed state is simply the entanglement of superposition\nstates of GHZ and W. When the decomposition contains 4 quantum states, the\ntripartite entanglement of the mixed state is a liner function of p. We also\nstudy the relations between the three-tangle and three-\\pi. It is shown that\nthe three-tangle is smaller than the three-\\pi. Moreover, the three-\\pi\\ has a\nminimal point in the interval 0 and 1, while the three-tangle is a non\ndecreasing function of p.\n", "  The OPERA experiment aims at measuring the \\nu_{\\mu} -> \\nu_{\\tau}\noscillation through the \\nu_{\\tau} appearance in an almost pure \\nu_{\\mu} beam\n(CNGS). For the direct identification of the short-lived {\\tau} lepton,\nproduced in \\nu_{\\tau} CC interactions, a micrometric detection resolution is\nneeded. Therefore the OPERA detector makes use of nuclear emulsion films, the\nhighest spatial resolution tracking device, combined with lead plates in an\nemulsion cloud chamber (ECC) structure called 'brick'. In this paper the\nnuclear emulsion analysis chain is reported; the strategy and the algorithms\nset up will be described together with their performances.\n", "  We describe recent results from our studies of the UV to IR evolution of\nasymptotically free vectorial gauge theories and quasiconformal behavior. These\ninclude higher-loop calculations of the IR zero of the beta function and of the\nanomalous dimension of the fermion bilinear. Effects of scheme-dependence of\nhigher-loop results are assessed in detail. Applications to models with\ndynamical electroweak symmetry breaking are discussed.\n", "  Two important features of mesoscopic Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) electronic\ninterferometers are analyzed: decoherence due to coupling with other degrees of\nfreedom and the coupled transport of charge and heat. We first review the\nprinciples of decoherence of electronic interference. We then analyze the\nthermoelectric transport in a ring threaded by such a flux, with a molecular\nbridge on one of its arms. The charge carriers may also interact inelastically\nwith the molecular vibrations. This nano-system is connected to three termi-\nnals; two of them are electric and thermal, held at slightly different chemical\npotentials and temperatures, and the third is purely thermal. For example, a\nphonon bath thermalizing the molecular vibrations. When this third terminal is\nheld at a temperature different from those of the electronic reservoirs, both\nan electrical and a heat current are, in general, gen- erated between the\nlatter. Likewise, a voltage and/or temperature difference between the\nelectronic terminals leads to thermal current between the thermal and\nelectronic terminals. The transport coefficients governing these conversions\n(due to energy exchange between the electrons and the vibrations) and their\ndependences on the A-B flux are analyzed. Finally, the decoherence due to these\ninelastic events is discussed.\n", "  The inhomogeneous fluctuations that underlie structure formation - galaxies\nand CMB hotspots - might have been seeded by quantum cosmological fluctuations,\nas magnified by some inflationary mechanism. The Halliwell-Hawking model for\nthese, as a lower-energy semiclassical limit, is expected to be shared by many\ntheories. E.g. an O((H/m_pl)^2) suppression of power at large scales results\nfrom this. This model contains/suppresses very many terms; we want a\nqualitative understanding of the meaning of these terms and of different\nregimes resulting from different combinations of them. I study this with toy\nmodels that have tractable mathematics: minisuperspace and, especially,\nrelational particle mechanics. In the present Seminar, I consider in particular\naveraged terms with some lessons from Hartree-Fock approach to Atomic and\nMolecular Physics. One needs to anchor this on variational principles; treating\nthe subsequent equations is a numerical venture.\n", "  The \"catastrophe\" in solving the Dirac equation for an electron in the field\nof a point electric charge, which emerges for the charge numbers Z > 137, is\nremoved in this work by effective accounting of finite dimensions of nuclei.\nFor this purpose, in numerical solutions of equations for Dirac radial wave\nfunctions, we introduce a boundary condition at the nucleus boundary such that\nthe components of the electron current density is zero. As a result, for all\nnuclei of the periodic table the calculated energy levels practically coincide\nwith the energy levels in standard solutions of the Dirac equation in the\nexternal field of the Coulomb potential of a point charge. Further, for Z >\n105, the calculated energy level functions E(Z) are monotone and smooth.The\nlower energy level reaches the energy E=-mc^{2} (the electron \"drop\" on a\nnuclei) at Zc = 178. The proposed method of accounting of the finite size of\nnuclei can be easily used in numerical calculations of energy levels of\nmany-electron atoms.\n", "  Degenerate quantum gases of alkaline-earth-like elements open new\nopportunities in research areas ranging from molecular physics to the study of\nstrongly correlated systems. These experiments exploit the rich electronic\nstructure of these elements, which is markedly different from the one of other\nspecies for which quantum degeneracy has been attained. Specifically,\nalkaline-earth-like atoms, such as strontium, feature metastable triplet\nstates, narrow intercombination lines, and a non-magnetic, closed-shell ground\nstate. This review covers the creation of quantum degenerate gases of strontium\nand the first experiments performed with this new system. It focuses on\nlaser-cooling and evaporation schemes, which enable the creation of\nBose-Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases of all strontium isotopes,\nand shows how they are used for the investigation of optical Feshbach\nresonances, the study of degenerate gases loaded into an optical lattice, as\nwell as the coherent creation of Sr_2 molecules.\n", "  After the discovery of a Higgs-like boson with a mass of m~125 GeV at the\nLHC, we can now attempt to draw conclusions about physics beyond the Standard\nModel. I argue that there are several hints towards new physics at intermediate\nscales > 10^8 GeV. I review a class of stringy models with intermediate scale\nSUSY which relate the observed Higgs mass to symmetries of the Higgs sector. I\nthen discuss radiative corrections to m_h, unification, dark matter and the\npossibility of classically unstable UV completions in these models.\n", "  We have studied the effect of hypothetical violations of Lorentz and CPT\nsymmetry by calculating the corrections to the energy levels of hydrogen\ninduced by the Standard-Model Extension (SME). Hydrogen studies are interesting\nbecause the energy levels of hydrogen can be measured with great precision and\nthe theory for hydrogen based on the Standard Model (SM) is well understood. We\nobtained corrections through order \\alpha^2 times the SME parameters for all\nlevels of hydrogen and applied them to determine the SME corrections to the\ntransition frequency for the 2S-1S transition.\n", "  We use the final results from Gravity Probe B to set new upper limits on the\ngravitational sector of the Standard-Model Extension, including for the first\ntime the coefficient associated with the time-time component of the new field\nresponsible for inducing local Lorentz violation in the theory.\n", "  We present a method to calculate the nonrelativistic hamiltonian for the\nminimal Standard-Model Extension matter sector in a uniform gravitational\nfield. The resulting hamiltonian coincides with earlier results in the\ncorresponding limits but it also includes spin-dependent terms that were\npreviously unknown. The phenomenology associated with this hamiltonian is\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  Our search for non-magnetic spin-dependent interactions is based on the\nmeasurement of free precession of nuclear spin polarized 3He and 129Xe atoms in\na homogeneous magnetic guiding field of about 400 nT. We report on our approach\nto perform an adiabatic rotation of the guiding field that allows us to\nmodulate possible non-magnetic spin-dependent interactions and to find an\noptimization procedure for long transverse relaxation times T2* both for Helium\nand Xenon.\n", "  We analyze the depolarization of ultracold neutrons confined in a magnetic\nfield configuration similar to those used in existing or proposed\nmagneto-gravitational storage experiments aiming at a precise measurement of\nthe neutron lifetime. We use an approximate quantum mechanical analysis such as\npioneered by Walstrom \\emph{et al} [Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A 599, 82\n(2009)]. Our analysis is not restricted to purely vertical modes of neutron\nmotion. The lateral motion is shown to cause the predominant depolarization\nloss in a magnetic storage trap.\n", "  We report some general phenomenological results concerning CP and CPT\nviolations in joint decays of entangled pseudoscalar neutral mesons.\n", "  High-energy astrophysics observations provide the best possibilities to\ndetect a very small violation of Lorentz invariance, such as may be related to\nthe structure of space-time near the Planck scale. I discuss the possible\nsignatures of Lorentz invariance violation that can be manifested by observing\nthe spectra, polarization, and timing of gamma-rays from active galactic nuclei\nand gamma-ray bursts. Other sensitive tests are provided by observations of the\nspectra of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays and very high-energy neutrinos. I also\ndiscuss a new time-of-flight analysis of observations of GRB 090510 by the\nFermi gamma-ray Space Telescope. These results, based on high-energy\nastrophysical observations, have fundamental implications for space-time\nphysics and quantum gravity models.\n", "  We have developed an apparatus to test Lorentz invariance in the photon\nsector by measuring the resonant frequency difference between two\ncounterpropagating directions of an asymmetric optical ring cavity using a\ndouble-pass configuration. No significant evidence for the violation was found\nat the level of $\\delta c /c \\lesssim 10^{-14}$. Details of our apparatus and\nrecent results are presented.\n", "  The KATRIN experiment, presently under construction in Karlsruhe, Germany,\nwill improve on previous laboratory limits on the neutrino mass by a factor of\nten. KATRIN will use a high-activity, gaseous T2 source and a very\nhigh-resolution spectrometer to measure the shape of the high-energy tail of\nthe tritium-decay beta spectrum. The shape measurement will also be sensitive\nto new physics, including sterile neutrinos and Lorentz violation. This report\nsummarizes recent progress in the experiment.\n", "  We report on our current progress in the study of finite one-loop radiative\ncorrections in the minimal Lorentz- and CPT-violating QED extension.\n", "  The unitarity of a Lorentz-invariance violating QED model with higher-order\nMyers and Pospelov photons coupled to standard fermions is studied. As\nexpected, we find ghost states associated to the higher-order terms that may\nlead to the loss of unitarity. An explicit calculation to check perturbative\nunitarity in the process of electron-positron scattering is performed and it is\nfound to be possible to be preserved.\n", "  Urea, a polar molecule with a large dipole moment, not only destabilizes the\nfolded RNA structures, but can also enhance the folding rates of large\nribozymes. Unlike the mechanism of urea-induced unfolding of proteins, which is\nwell understood, the action of urea on RNA has barely been explored. We\nperformed extensive all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine\nthe molecular underpinnings of urea-induced RNA denaturation. Urea displays its\ndenaturing power in both secondary and tertiary motifs of the riboswitch (RS)\nstructure. Our simulations reveal that the denaturation of RNA structures is\nmainly driven by the hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions of urea with the\nbases. Through detailed studies of the simulation trajectories, we found that\ngeminate pairs between urea and bases due to hydrogen bonds and stacks persist\nonly ~ (0.1-1) ns, which suggests that urea-base interaction is highly dynamic.\nMost importantly, the early stage of base pair disruption is triggered by\npenetration of water molecules into the hydrophobic domain between the RNA\nbases. The infiltration of water into the narrow space between base pairs is\ncritical in increasing the accessibility of urea to transiently disrupted\nbases, thus allowing urea to displace inter base hydrogen bonds. This\nmechanism, water-induced disruption of base-pairs resulting in the formation of\na \"wet\" destabilized RNA followed by solvation by urea, is the exact opposite\nof the two-stage denaturation of proteins by urea. In the latter case, initial\nurea penetration creates a dry-globule, which is subsequently solvated by water\npenetration leading to global protein unfolding. Our work shows that the\nability to interact with both water and polar, non-polar components of\nnucleotides makes urea a powerful chemical denaturant for nucleic acids.\n", "  The Double Chooz reactor-based oscillation experiment searches for an\nelectron antineutrino disappearance signal to investigate the neutrino mass\nmatrix mixing angle theta 13. Double Chooz's reported evidence for this\ndisappearance is generally interpreted as mass-driven mixing through this\nparameter. However, the electron antineutrino candidates collected by the\nexperiment can also be used to search for a signature of the violation of\nLorentz invariance.\n  We study the sidereal time dependence of the antineutrino signal rate and\nprobe Lorentz violation within the Standard-Model Extension (SME) framework. We\nfind that the data prefer the sidereal time independent solution, and a number\nof limits are applied to the relevant SME coefficients, including the first\nconstraints on those associated with Lorentz violation in the e-tau mixing\nsector.\n", "  The equivalence principle can be tested by precision experiments based on\nclassical and quantum systems, on the ground as well as in space. In many\nmodels, these tests are mostly equivalent in their ability to constrain physics\nbeyond the Standard Model. We mention differences that nevertheless exist\nbetween spaceborne and quantum mechanical tests and their conventional\ncompetitors.\n", "  We propose using a Stark interference technique to directly measure the\nodd-parity c_{0j} components of the electron sector c_{\\mu\\nu} tensor of the\nStandard-Model Extension. This technique has been shown to be a sensitive probe\nof parity violation in atomic dysprosium in a low-energy, tabletop experiment,\nand may also be straightforwardly applied to test Lorentz invariance. We\nestimate that such an experiment may be sensitive to c_{0j} coefficients as\nsmall as 10^{-18}.\n", "  Searches for Lorentz and CPT violation using neutrino oscillations and the\nprospects for future tests using neutrino time-of-flight measurements and\nbeta-decay experiments are presented.\n", "  Recently published data suggest a possible solar influence on some nuclear\ndecay rates, including evidence for an annual variation attributed to the\nvarying Earth-Sun distance. Here, we consider the possibility that the annual\nsignal seen by the DAMA collaboration, and interpreted by them as evidence for\ndark matter, may in fact be due to the radioactive contaminant K-40, which is\nknown to be present in their detector. We also consider the possibility that\npart of the DAMA signal may arise from relic big-bang neutrinos.\n", "  This brief review discusses Lorentz-violating operators of arbitrary\ndimension within the photon and neutrino sectors of the Standard-Model\nExtension.\n", "  We show that violation of the Lorentz symmetry in quantum electrodynamics can\nsuppress the rates of the interactions crucial for the formation of\nphoton-induced air showers, such as pair production on nuclei and in the\ngeomagnetic field. As a consequence, the allowed region in the space of\nLorentz-violating parameters will be seriously restricted if several photons\nwith energies $\\gtrsim\\,10^{19}\\, {eV}$ are detected.\n", "  Lorentz and CPT violation can affect the rates for $t$-$\\ol t$ production and\ndecay. The Lorentz-violating coefficients in the Standard-Model Extension\nresponsible for modifying the top-quark events have recently been bounded by\nthe D0 Collaboration. To extend the analysis to the LHC the calculations need\nto be extended to include the gluon fusion production mechanism. Some of the\nfirst results of this program were presented at the Meeting.\n", "  In this communication, we focus on possibilities to constrain SME\ncoefficients using Cassini and Messenger data. We present simulations of\nradioscience observables within the framework of the SME, identify the linear\ncombinations of SME coefficients the observations depend on and determine the\nsensitivity of these measurements to the SME coefficients. We show that these\ndatasets are very powerful for constraining SME coefficients.\n", "  Constraints on Lorentz violation in matter-gravity couplings are summarized\nalong with existing proposals to obtain sensitivities that exceed current\nlimits by up to 11 orders of magnitude.\n", "  This talk, given at CPT'13, showed Super-Kamiokande atmospheric-neutrino\nMonte Carlo sensitivity to Lorentz-violation effects using the perturbative\nmodel derived from the Standard-Model Extension.\n", "  We searched for a sidereal modulation in the rate of neutrinos observed by\nthe MINOS far detector. The detection of these signals could be a signature of\nneutrino-antineutrino mixing due to Lorentz and CPT violation as described by\nthe Standard-Model Extension framework. We found no evidence for these sidereal\nsignals and we placed limits on the coefficients in this theory describing the\neffect.\n", "  The recent extensions of the covariant energy density functional theory with\nthe quasiparticle-vibration coupling (QVC) are reviewed. Formulation of the\nQuasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA) in the relativistic framework\nis discussed. Self-consistent extensions of the relativistic QRPA imply the QVC\nwhich is implemented in two-body propagators in the nuclear medium. This\nprovides fragmentation of the QRPA states describing the damping of the\nvibrational motion.\n", "  The physics of classical particles in a Lorentz-breaking spacetime has\nnumerous features resembling the properties of Finsler geometry. In particular,\nthe Lagrange function plays a role similar to that of a Finsler structure\nfunction. A summary is presented of recent results, including new calculable\nFinsler structures based on Lagrange functions appearing in the\nLorentz-violation framework known as the Standard-Model Extension.\n", "  We present the design and first measurement results for an ultra-stable\ncryogenically cooled optical sapphire resonator system with a potential\nrelative frequency stability better than 3x10^-17. This level of oscillator\nstability allows for more precise tests of Einstein's theories of relativity\nand thus could help to find first hints of \"new physics\". We will give some\ndetails on a projected experiment to test Lorentz invariance that will utilize\nthese cavities.\n", "  We consider the possibility of Lorentz-invariance violation in weak-decay\nprocesses. We present a general approach that entails modifying the W-boson\npropagator by adding a Lorentz-violating tensor to it. We describe the effects\nof Lorentz violation on nuclear beta decay in this scenario. In particular we\nshow the expression for a first-forbidden transition with a spin change of two.\nUsing data from an old experiment on the rotational invariance of yttrium-90,\nwe derive several bounds on the Lorentz-violating parameters of the order of\n10^(-6)-10^(-8).\n", "  Quantum metrology is the science that aims to achieve precision measurements\nby making use of quantum principles. Attribute to the well-developed techniques\nof manipulating and detecting cold atoms, cold atomic systems provide an\nexcellent platform for implementing precision quantum metrology. In this\nchapter, we review the general procedures of quantum metrology and some\nexperimental progresses in quantum metrology with cold atoms. Firstly, we give\nthe general framework of quantum metrology and the calculation of quantum\nFisher information, which is the core of quantum parameter estimation. Then, we\nintroduce the quantum interferometry with single and multiparticle states. In\nparticular, for some typical multiparticle states, we analyze their ultimate\nprecision limits and show how quantum entanglement could enhance the\nmeasurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit. Further, we review\nsome experimental progresses in quantum metrology with cold atomic systems.\n", "  A frequently confused point in studies of symmetry violation is the\ndistinction between observer and particle transformations. In this work, we\nconsider a model in which a coefficient in the Standard-Model Extension leads\nto violations of rotation invariance in Newton's second law. The model\nhighlights the distinction between observer and particle transformations.\n", "  The framework of the Standard-Model Extension (SME) provides a relativistic\nquantum field theory for the study of Lorentz violation. The classical,\nnonrelativistic equations of motion can be extracted as a limit that is useful\nin various scenarios. In this work, we consider the effects of certain SME\ncoefficients for Lorentz violation on the motion of macroscopic objects having\nnet intrinsic spin in the classical, nonrelativistic limit.\n", "  Simulations of r-process nucleosynthesis require nuclear physics information\nfor thousands of neutron-rich nuclear species from the line of stability to the\nneutron drip line. While arguably the most important pieces of nuclear data for\nthe r-process are the masses and beta decay rates, individual neutron capture\nrates can also be of key importance in setting the final r-process abundance\npattern. Here we consider the influence of neutron capture rates in forming the\nA~80 and rare earth peaks.\n", "  About half of the heavy elements in the Solar System were created by rapid\nneutron capture, or r-process, nucleosynthesis. In the r-process, heavy\nelements are built up via a sequence of neutron captures and beta decays in\nwhich an intense neutron flux pushes material out towards the neutron drip\nline. The nuclear network simulations used to test potential astrophysical\nscenarios for the r-process therefore require nuclear physics data (masses,\nbeta decay lifetimes, neutron capture rates, fission probabilities) for\nthousands of nuclei far from stability. Only a small fraction of this data has\nbeen experimentally measured. Here we discuss recent sensitivity studies that\naim to determine the nuclei whose properties are most crucial for r-process\ncalculations.\n", "  We give a brief overview of time dilation tests using high-resolution laser\nspectroscopy at heavy-ion storage rings. We reflect on the various methods used\nto eliminate the first-order Doppler effect and on the pitfalls encountered,\nand comment on possible extensions at future facilities providing relativistic\nheavy ion beams at $\\gamma \\gg 1$.\n", "  We propose a CPT-even and Lorentz-violating dimension-five nonminimal\ncoupling between fermionic and gauge fields, involving the CPT-even and\nLorentz-violating gauge tensor of the Standard-Model Extension. This nonminimal\ncoupling modifies the nonrelativistic regime of Dirac particles, inducing new\neffects such as an electric-Zeeman-like spectrum splitting and an\nanomalous-like contribution to the electron magnetic moment. These new effects\nallow to constrain the magnitude of this nonminimal coupling in 1 part in\n$10^{16}.$\n", "  The general features of renormalization and the renormalization group in QED\nand in general quantum field theories in curved spacetime with additional\nLorentz- and CPT-violating background fields are reviewed.\n", "  We have analyzed Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs BPS vortices in a\nLorentz-violating CPT-odd context. The Lorentz violation induces profiles with\na conical behavior at the origin. For some combination of the coefficients for\nLorentz violation there always exists a sufficiently large winding number for\nwhich the magnetic field flips its sign.\n", "  The lagrangian-based Standard-Model Extension framework offers a broad\ndescription of possible gravitational effects from local Lorentz violation. In\nthis talk, I review the status of the theoretical and phenomenological work in\nthis area. The extension of previous results in linearized gravity to the\nnonlinear regime is discussed.\n", "  We present a proposal to include Lorentz-violating effects in gravitational\nfield by means of the Finsler geometry. In the Finsler set up, the length of an\nevent depends both on the point and the direction in the space-time. We briefly\nreview the bumblebee model, where the Lorentz violation is induced by a\nspontaneous symmetry breaking due to the bumblebee vector field.The main\ngeometrical concepts of the Finsler geometry are outlined. Using a Finslerian\nEinstein-Hilbert action we derive the bumblebee action from the bipartite\nFinsler function with a correction to the gravitational constant.\n", "  The Gupta Bleuler quantization procedure is applied to the SME photon sector.\nA direct application of the method to the massless case fails due to an\nunavoidable incompleteness in the polarization states. A mass term can be\nincluded into the photon lagrangian to rescue the quantization procedure and\nmaintain covariance.\n", "  Studying fundamental symmetries of Nature has proven fruitful in particle\nphysics. I argue that recent results at the LHC, and the naturalness problem\nhighlighted by them, provide a renewed motivation for tests of CPT symmetry as\na probe for physics beyond quantum field theory. I also discuss prospects for\nantihydrogen CPT tests with sensitivities to Planck scale suppressed effects.\n", "  The density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock (DC-TDHF) theory is a\nfully microscopic approach for calculating heavy-ion interaction potentials and\nfusion cross sections below and above the fusion barrier. We discuss recent\napplications of DC-TDHF method to fusion of light and heavy neutron-rich\nsystems.\n", "  The phenomenon of photonic band gaps in one-dimensional optical lattices is\nreviewed using a microscopic approach. Formally equivalent to the transfer\nmatrix approach in the thermodynamic limit, a microscopic model is required to\nstudy finite-size effects, such as deviations from the Bragg condition.\nMicroscopic models describing both scalar and vectorial light are proposed, as\nwell as for two- and three-level atoms. Several analytical results are compared\nto experimental data, showing a good agreement.\n", "  The radiation hardness of commercial Silicon Carbide and Gallium Nitride\npower MOSFETs is presented in this paper, for Total Ionizing Dose effects and\nSingle Event Effects, under gamma, neutrons, protons and heavy ions. Similar\ntests are discussed for commercial DC-DC converters, also tested in operation\nunder magnetic field.\n", "  The Belle detector operated at KEKb B-factory in 1999-2010 was one of the\nmost remarkable experiments in the field of elementary particle physics of the\nlast decades. The Belle successor, Belle II collaboration, is aimed to operate\nthe Belle II detector at SuperKEKb factory at 40 times higher luminosity.\nIncreased luminosity imposes new requirements on the detector elements: they\nhave to survive at higher radiation levels, to operate at higher loads and at\nhigher backgrounds. The Belle K_L and muon system based on the resistive plate\nchambers (RPC) technology worked well during all data taking period, however at\nBelle II environments its performance decreases to negligible level due to\nincreasing load and high neutron background. To sustain detector operation it\nwill be replaced by the new system based on the scintillation strips read-out\nby silicon photomultipliers. The latter technology allows not only to reach\ntime resolution at level of 1 ns but also perform the amplitude measurements.\nNowadays the production of the new EKLM system's elements are under way. The\nassembly at KEK is started this fall.\n", "  In this paper, we review a way to change nature of phase transition with\nannealing methods in mind. Annealing methods are regarded as a general\ntechnique to solve optimization problems efficiently. In annealing methods, we\nintroduce a controllable parameter which represents a kind of fluctuation and\ndecrease the parameter gradually. Annealing methods face with a difficulty when\na phase transition point exists during the protocol. Then, it is important to\ndevelop a method to avoid the phase transition by introducing a new type of\nfluctuation. By taking the Potts model for instance, we review a way to change\nthe phase transition nature. Although the method described in this paper does\nnot succeed to avoid the phase transition, we believe that the concept of the\nmethod will be useful for optimization problems.\n", "  This article reviews the methods used to obtain a two-sided bound on\nisotropic modified Maxwell theory from experimental data of ultra high-energy\ncosmic rays in 2008. The bound is updated with results from the HEGRA\nexperiment.\n", "  In liquid-state NMR quantum computation, a selective entanglement operator\nbetween qubits 2 and 3 of a three-qubit molecule is conventionally realized by\napplying a pair of short $\\pi$-pulses to qubit 1. This method, called\nrefocusing, is well suited for heteronuclear molecules. When the molecule is\nhomonuclear, however, the $\\pi$-pulses applied to qubit 1 often induce unwanted\n$z$-rotations on qubits 2 and 3, even if the $z$-components of qubits 2 and 3\nare left unchanged. This phenomenon is known as the transient Bloch-Siegert\neffect, and compensation thereof is required for precise gate operation. We\npropose an alternative refocusing method, in which a weak square pulse is\napplied to qubit 1. This technique has the advantage of curbing the\nBloch-Siegert effect, making it suitable for both hetero- and homonuclear\nmolecules.\n", "  We report the discovery of a giant double-lobed (lobe-core-lobe)\nradio-continuum structure associated with QSO J0443.8-6141 at z=0.72. This QSO\nwas originally identified during the follow-up of a sample of ROSAT All Sky\nSurvey sources at radio and optical frequencies. With a linear size of ~0.77\nMpc, QSO J0443.8-6141 is classified as a giant radio source (GRS); based on its\nphysical properties, we classify QSO J0443.8-6141 as a FR II radio galaxy.\nHigh-resolution observations are required to reliably identify GRSs; the next\ngeneration of southern-sky radio and optical surveys will be crucial to\nincreasing our sample of these objects.\n", "  Phase I of the NEXT-100 $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ experiment (NEW) is scheduled for\ndata taking in 2015 at Laboratorio Subterr\\'aneo de Canfranc in the Spanish\nPyrenees. Thanks to the light proportional technique, NEW anticipates an\noutstanding energy resolution nearing the Fano factor in Xenon\n(0.5-1%FWHM@$Q_{\\beta\\beta,^{136}Xe}$), with a TPC-design that allows tracking\nand identification of the double end-blob feature of the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\ndecay. When properly mastered, the combination of these two assets can suppress\nthe irreducible $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ and (single-blob) $\\gamma$ backgrounds from\nnatural radioactivity to minute levels, of the order of $5\\times{10^{-4}}$\nckky. Given our knowledge of the available phase-space as obtained from\nneutrino oscillation experiments, this feat will expectedly allow for a\nsensitivity to the effective electron neutrino mass of $m_{\\beta\\beta}\\simeq\n30$ meV for exposures at the 20 ton $\\times$ year scale. Hence, ultimately, a\nfull survey of the inverse hierarchy of the neutrino mass ordering appears to\nbe within reach for a ton-scale experiment based on this technology.\n  NEW, with 10 kg of Xenon 90%-enriched in $^{136}$Xe, sets an unprecedented\nscale for gaseous Xenon TPCs and will be an important milestone for its\nanticipated upgrades (100 kg and 1 ton). I briefly summarize the status of the\nNEXT experiment, from the main results obtained with $\\sim 1$ kg prototypes\nthat substantiate the concept, to the ongoing works for deploying its first\nphase.\n", "  I review some of the major developments in the theoretical background and\nexperimental uses of binary pulsars to explore local Lorentz invariance in the\ngravitational sector and its possible violation.\n", "  This is a brief review on the first Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) optical\nidentifications - GRB host galaxies and Star Forming Rate (SFR) at relatively\nsmall redshifts (z), on the metallicities of GRB hosts, the similarities and\ndifferences between GRB hosts and galaxies at larger z, and on the SFR and GRB\nrate (GRBR) at high z. Evidences of a direct connection between long-duration\nGRBs and massive stars explosions (like Core-Collapse Super-Novae - CCSNe) are\npresented. Is there a fast decrease in SFR up to z ~10? Some unsolved problems\nrelated to GRBs are discussed: about the high-z GRB host galaxies, the high-z\nCCSN-GRB connection, and possible new crucial cosmological tests at high z.\n", "  The hadron production in heavy ion collision is treated in the framework of\nthermodynamic vision. Thermodynamic system formed during central collision of\nPb-Pb at high energies is considered, through which binary collision is assumed\namong the valance quarks. The partition function of the system is calculated;\naccordingly the free available energy, the entropy and the chemical potential\nare calculated. The concept of string fragmentation and defragmentation are\nused to form the newly produced particles. The average multiplicity of the\nnewly produced particles are calculated and compared with the recent\nexperimental results.\n", "  The study of neutrinos is fundamental to connect astrophysics and elementary\nparticle physics. In this last decade solar neutrino experiments and KamLAND\nconfirmed the LMA solution and further clarified the mass and oscillation\npattern. Borexino attacked also the study of the low energy neutrino spectrum.\nHowever, important points still need clarification, like the apparent anomaly\nin the vacuum to matter transition region. Besides, a more detailed study of\nthe low energy components of the pp cycle, combined with a measurement of CNO\nfluxes, is compulsory, also to discriminate between the low and the high Z\nversions of the Solar Standard Models and solve the metallicity problem. We\ndiscuss the main recent advancements and the possibilities of studying these\nopen problems with Borexino, SNO+ and the future experiments, like the next\ngeneration of scintillators.\n", "  The twisted space-time reduced model of large $N$ QCD with various flavours\nof adjoint Wilson fermions is constructed applying the symmetric twist boundary\nconditions with flux $k$. The models with one and two flavours show distinctive\nbehaviours. For the two flavor case, the string tension, calculated at $N=289$,\napproaches zero as we decrease the quark mass in a way consistent with the\ntheory being governed by an infrared fixed point. In contrast, the string\ntension for the case of a single adjoint Wilson fermion remains finite as the\nquark mass decreases to zero, supporting that this is a confining theory.\n", "  When colliding, the high energy hadrons can either produce new particles or\nscatter elastically without change of their quantum numbers and other particles\nproduced. Namely elastic scatterings of hadrons are considered in this paper.\nThe general machinery of their theoretical treatment is described. Some new\nexperimental data are presented and confronted to phenomenological approaches.\nThe internal structure of hadrons is the main subject of these studies. Its\nimpact on properties of their interactions is reviewed. It is shown that\nprotons become larger and darker with increase of their collision energy and\nreveal some substructure. The violation of the geometric scaling in the\ndiffraction cone and new problems of description of differential cross sections\noutside it are described.\n", "  Ion traps, which were first introduced in the late 1950s and early 1960s,\nhave established themselves as indispensable tools in many areas of physics,\nchemistry and technology. This chapter gives a brief survey of the operating\nprinciples and development of ion traps, together with a short description of\nhow ions are loaded and detected. This is followed by a brief account of some\nof the current applications of ion traps.\n", "  The physical model that allows to calculate the values of the tunneling\ncurrent be-tween graphene layers is proposed. The tunneling current according\nto the pro-posed model is proportional to the area of tunneling transition. The\ncalculated value of tunneling conductivity is in qualitative agreement with\nexperimental data.\n", "  Various techniques are used to detect the presence of charged particles\nstored in electromagnetic traps, their energy, their mass, or their internal\nstates. Detection methods can rely on the variation of the number of trapped\nparticles (destructive methods) or the use of the ion's interaction with\nelectromagnetic radiation as a non-destructive tool to probe the trapped\nparticles. This review gives an introduction into various methods, discussing\nthe basic mode of operation completed by the description of recent\nrealizations.\n", "  We consider the relativistic phase space coordinates (x_{\\mu},p_{\\mu}) as\ncomposite, described by functions of the primary pair of twistor coordinates.\nIt appears that if twistor coordinates are canonicaly quantized the composite\nspace-time coordinates are becoming noncommutative. We obtain deformed\nHeisenberg algebra which in order to be closed should be enlarged by the\nPauli-Lubanski four-vector components. We further comment on star-product\nquantization of derived algebraic structures which permit to introduce\nspin-extended deformed Heisenberg algebra.\n", "  The investigation of solar cells degradation and the prediction of its\nend-of-life performance is of primary importance in the preparation of a space\nmission. In the present work, we investigate the reduction of solar-cells'\nmaximum power resulting from irradiations with electrons and protons. Both GaAs\nsingle junction and GaInP/GaAs/Ge triple junction solar cells were studied. The\nresults obtained indicate how i) the dominant radiation damaging mechanism is\ndue to atomic displacements, ii) the relative maximum power degradation is\nalmost independent of the type of incoming particle, i.e., iii) to a first\napproximation, the fitted semi-empirical function expressing the decrease of\nmaximum power depends only on the absorbed NIEL dose, and iv) the actual\ndisplacement threshold energy value (Ed=21 eV) accounts for annealing\ntreatments, mostly due to self-annealing induced effects. Thus, for a given\ntype of solar cell, a unique maximum power degradation curve can be determined\nas a function of the absorbed NIEL dose. The latter expression allows one to\npredict the performance of those solar cells in space radiation environment.\n", "  We consider infrared dependences of chiral effects, like chiral magnetic\neffect, in chiral media. The main observation is that there exist competing\ninfrared-sensitive parameters, sometimes not apparent. The value of the chiral\neffects depends in fact on the actual hierarchy of the parameters. Some\nexamples have been already given in the literature. We argue that\nmagnetostatics of chiral media with a non-vanishing chiral chemical potential\n$\\mu_5\\neq 0$ is also infrared sensitive. In particular, the system turns to be\nunstable if the volume is large enough. The instability is with respect to the\ndecay of the system into domains of non-vanishing magnetic field with\nnon-trivial helicity.\n", "  Massive gravity is an old idea: trading geometry for mass. Much effort has\nbeen expended on establishing a healthy model, culminating in the current\nghost-free version. We summarize here our recent findings -- that it is still\nuntenable -- because it is locally acausal: CTC solutions can be constructed in\na small neighborhood of any event.\n", "  We review how localization is used to probe holographic duality and, more\ngenerally, non-perturbative dynamics of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric\ngauge theories in the planar large-N limit.\n", "  We briefly review the recent studies of the behavior of composite systems in\nmagnetic field. The hydrogen atom is chosen to demonstrate the new results\nwhich may be experimentally tested. Possible applications to physics of\nantihydrogen are mentioned.\n", "  The AMS-02 experiment confirms the excess of positrons in cosmic rays (CRs)\nfor energy above 10 GeV with respect to the secondary production of positrons\nin the interstellar medium. This is interpreted as evidence of the existence of\na primary source of these particles. Possible candidates are dark matter or\nastrophysical sources. In this work we discuss the possible contribution due to\npulsars and their nebulae. Our key assumption is that the primary spectrum of\nelectrons and positrons at the source is the same of the well known photon\nspectrum observed from gamma-rays telescopes. Using a diffusion model in the\nGalaxy we propagate the source spectra up to the Solar System. We compare our\nresults with the recent experiments and with the LIS model\n", "  We formulate statistical mechanics based on a pure quantum state, which we\ncall a ``thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state''. A single TPQ state gives not only\nequilibrium values of mechanical variables, such as magnetization and\ncorrelation functions, but also those of genuine thermodynamic variables and\nthermodynamic functions, such as entropy and free energy. Among many possible\nTPQ states, we discuss the canonical TPQ state, the TPQ state whose temperature\nis specified. % We also propose there are other TPQ states. In the TPQ\nformulation of statistical mechanics, thermal fluctuations are completely\nincluded in quantum-mechanical fluctuations. As a consequence, TPQ states have\nmuch larger quantum entanglement than the equilibrium density operators of the\nensemble formulation. We also show that the TPQ formulation is very useful in\npractical computations, by applying the formulation to a frustrated\ntwo-dimensional quantum spin system.\n", "  Since Weinberg's proposal two decades ago, chiral effective field theory in\nthe NN sector has been developed and applied up to order $O((Q/M_{hi})^4)$. In\nprinciple it could provide a model-independent description of nuclear force\nfrom QCD. However, in spite of its huge success, some open issues such as the\nrenormalization group invariance and power counting, still remain to be solved.\nIn this talk we refine the chiral effective field theory approach to the NN\nsystem based on a renormalization group analysis. Our results show that a truly\nmodel-independent description of NN system can be obtained by a new power\ncounting which treats the subleading order corrections perturbatively.\n", "  In this chapter, we describe scattering resonance phenomena in general, and\nfocus on the mechanism of Feshbach resonances, for which a multi-channel\ntreatment is required. We derive the dependence of the scattering phase shift\non magnetic field and collision energy. From this, the scattering length and\neffective range coefficient can be extracted, expressions which are\nparticularly useful for ultracold gases.\n", "  We investigate thermodynamics of hadrons using the Gaussian functional method\n(GFM) at finite temperature. Since the interaction among mesons is very large,\nwe take into account fluctuations of mesons around their mean field values\nusing the GFM. We obtain the ground state energy by solving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. The meson masses are obtained using the energy minimization\ncondition. The resulting mass of the Nambu-Goldstone boson is not zero even in\nthe spontaneous chiral symmetry broken phase due to the non-perturbative\neffect. We consider then the bound state of mesons using the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation and show that the Nambu-Goldstone theorem is recovered. We investigate\nfurther the behavior of the meson masses and the mean filed value as functions\nof temperature for the cases of chiral limit and explicit chiral symmetry\nbreaking.\n", "  The hidden-variable question is whether or not various properties ---\nrandomness or correlation, for example --- that are observed in the outcomes of\nan experiment can be explained via introduction of extra (hidden) variables\nwhich are unobserved by the experimenter. The question can be asked in both the\nclassical and quantum domains. In the latter, it is fundamental to the\ninterpretation of the quantum formalism (Bell [1964], Kochen and Specker\n[1967], and others). In building a suitable mathematical model of an\nexperiment, the physical set-up will guide us on how to model the observable\nvariables --- i.e., the measurement and outcome spaces. But, by definition, we\ncannot know what structure to put on the hidden-variable space. Nevertheless,\nwe show that, under a measure-theoretic condition, the hidden-variable question\ncan be put into a canonical form. The condition is that the $\\sigma$-algebras\non the measurement and outcome spaces are countably generated. An argument\nusing a classical result on isomorphisms of measure algebras then shows that\nthe hidden-variable space can always be taken to be the unit interval equipped\nwith the Lebesgue measure on the Borel sets.\n", "  A model is presented for the origin of the large scale structure of the\nuniverse and their Mass-Radius scaling law; a fractal power law, $M \\propto\nR^D$, with dimension $D=2$, most significantly. The physics is conventional,\northodox, but it is used to fashion a highly unorthodox model of the origin of\nthe galaxies, their groups, clusters, super-clusters, and great walls. The\nscaling law fits the observational results and the model offers new suggestions\nand predictions. These include a largest, a supreme, cosmic structure, and\npossible implications for the recently observed pressing cosmological\nanomalies.\n", "  We review diverse two-dimensional models emerging on the world sheet of\nnon-Abelian strings in the low-energy limit. Non-Abelian strings are supported\nin a class of four-dimensional bulk theories with or without supersymmetry. In\nsupersymmetric bulk theories we are mostly interested in BPS-saturated strings.\nSome of these two-dimensional models, in particular, heterotic models, were\nscarcely studied in the past, if at all. Our main emphasis is on the heterotic\nN=(0,2) models. We describe their large-N solution. We briefly comment on\nN=(0,1) models although so far they are not obtained on the the world sheet of\nnon-Abelian strings.\n", "  We provide an introduction to the experimental physics of quantum gases. At\nthe low densities of ultracold quantum gases, confinement can be understood\nfrom single-particle physics, and interactions can be understood from two-body\nphysics. The structure of atoms provides resonances both in the optical domain\nand in the radio-frequency domain. Atomic structure data is given for the 27\natomic isotopes that had been brought to quantum degeneracy at the time this\nchapter was written. We discuss the motivations behind choosing among these\nspecies. We review how static and oscillatory fields are treated\nmathematically. An electric dipole moment can be induced in a neutral atom, and\nis the basis for optical manipulation as well as short-range interactions. Many\natoms have permanent magnetic dipole moments, which can be used for trapping or\nlong-range interactions. The Toronto $^{40}$K/$^{87}$Rb lattice experiment\nprovides an illustration of how these tools are combined to create an\nultracold, quantum-degenerate gas.\n", "  A high performance Space-Time Reference in orbit could be realized using a\nstable atomic clock in a precisely defined orbit and linking that to high\naccuracy atomic clocks on the ground using a laser based time-transfer link.\nThis would enhance performance of existing systems and provide unique\ncapabilities in navigation, precise timing, earth sciences, geodesy and the\nsame approach could provide a platform for testing fundamental physics in\nspace. Precise laser time- and frequency-transfer from the ground to an\norbiting satellite would make it possible to improve upon the current state of\nthe art in timing (about 1 to 30 ns achieved with GPS) by roughly a factor of\n1000 to the 1 ps level.\n", "  In this review we consider the concept of limit cycles in the renormalization\ngroup flows. The examples of this phenomena in the quantum mechanics and field\ntheory will be presented.\n", "  The present paper highlights the data analysis status of the OPERA\nexperiment. The experiment was designed to perform the neutrino interactions\nanalysis on event-by-event basis, and optimized to search for $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\rightarrow \\nu_{\\tau}$ oscillation in appearance mode, also allowing to\nperform a $\\nu_{e}$ appearance search.\n  We review the data simulation and the analysis chains implemented to search\nfor $\\nu_{\\tau}$ interactions. The main kinematical parameters sensitive to the\nneutrino flavor are discussed, the uncertainties of the event parameter\nestimation are reviewed, and the main sources of background for the $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\rightarrow \\nu_{\\tau}$ oscillation search are examined. The topologies of the\ntwo first $\\nu_{\\tau}$ candidate events are presented.\n  Finally, we review the status of the $\\nu_{e}$ appearance search and present\nthe constraints set by the OPERA experiment on the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$\nand on the LSND/MiniBooNE anomaly.\n", "  How massive the hybrid stars could be is discussed by a \"3-window model\"\nproposed from a new strategy to construct the equation of state with\nhadron-quark transition. It is found that hybrid stars have a strong\npotentiality to generate a large mass compatible with two-solar-mass neutron\nstar observations.\n", "  This chapter presents the crossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)\nstate of weakly-correlated pairs of fermions to the Bose-Einstein condensation\n(BEC) of diatomic molecules in the atomic Fermi gas. Our aim is to provide a\npedagogical review of the BCS-BEC crossover, with an emphasis on the basic\nconcepts, particularly those that are not generally known or are difficult to\nfind in the literature. We shall not attempt to give an exhaustive survey of\ncurrent research in the limited space here; where possible, we will direct the\nreader to more extensive reviews.\n", "  $\\alpha$-clustering study since the pioneering discovery of $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C\nmolecular resonances half a century ago. Our knowledge on physics of nuclear\nmolecules has increased considerably and nuclear clustering remains one of the\nmost fruitful domains of nuclear physics, facing some of the greatest\nchallenges and opportunities in the years ahead. The occurrence of \"exotic\"\nshapes in light $N$=$Z$ $\\alpha$-like nuclei is investigated. Various\napproaches of the superdeformed and hyperdeformed bands associated with\nquasimolecular resonant structures are presented. Evolution of clustering from\nstability to the drip-lines is examined: clustering aspects are, in particular,\ndiscussed for light exotic nuclei with large neutron excess such as\nneutron-rich Oxygen isotopes with their complete spectrocopy.\n", "  We consider semigroups $\\{\\alpha_t: \\; t\\geq 0\\}$ of normal, unital,\ncompletely positive maps $\\alpha_t$ on a von Neumann algebra ${\\mathcal M}$.\nThe (predual) semigroup $\\nu_t (\\rho):= \\rho \\circ \\alpha_t$ on normal states\n$\\rho$ of $\\mathcal M$ leaves invariant the face ${\\mathcal F}_p:= \\{\\rho : \\;\n\\rho (p)=1\\}$ supported by the projection $p\\in {\\mathcal M}$, if and only if\n$\\alpha_t(p)\\geq p$ (i.e., $p$ is sub-harmonic). We complete the arguments\nshowing that the sub-harmonic projections form a complete lattice. We then\nconsider $r_o$, the smallest projection which is larger than each support of a\nminimal invariant face; then $r_o$ is subharmonic. In finite dimensional cases\n$\\sup \\alpha_t(r_o)={\\bf 1}$ and $r_o$ is also the smallest projection $p$ for\nwhich $\\alpha_t(p)\\to {\\bf 1}$. If $\\{\\nu_t: \\; t\\geq 0\\}$ admits a faithful\nfamily of normal stationary states then $r_o={\\bf 1}$ is useless; if not, it\nhelps to reduce the problem of the asymptotic behaviour of the semigroup for\nlarge times.\n", "  A Friedmann--Robertson--Walker Universe is studied with a dark energy\ncomponent represented by a quintessence field. The Lagrangian for this system,\nhereafter called the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker--quintessence (FRWq) system,\nis presented. It is shown that the classical Lagrangian reproduces the usual\ntwo (second order) dynamical equations for the radius of the Universe and for\nthe quintessence scalar field as well as a (first order) constraint equation.\n  It is noted that the quintessence field (dark energy) is related with the\ntlaplon field (appearing on dynamical theories of spacetime torsion). Our\napproach naturally unifies gravity and dark energy, as it is obtained that the\nLagrangian and the equations of motion are those of a relativistic particle\nmoving on a two dimensional conformally flat spacetime, whereas the conformal\nmetric factor is related to the dark energy scalar field potential. We proceed\nto quantize the system in three different schemes. First, we assume the\nUniverse as a spinless particle (as it is common in literature), obtaining a\nquantum theory for a Universe described by the Klein--Gordon equation. Second,\nwe push the quantization scheme further assuming the Universe as a Dirac\nparticle, and therefore constructing its corresponding Dirac and the Majorana\ntheories. With the different theories we calculate the expected values for the\nscale factor of the Universe. They depend on the type of quantization scheme\nused. The differences between the Dirac and Majorana schemes are highlighted.\nThe implications of the different quantization procedures are discussed.\nFinally the possible consequences for a multiverse theory of the Dirac and\nMajorana quantized Universe are briefly considered.\n", "  We report here our results on how to obtain the Regge trajectory of a\nresonance from its pole in a scattering process by imposing analytic\nconstraints in the complex angular momentum plane. The method, suited for\nresonances that dominate an elastic scattering amplitude, has been applied to\nthe {\\rho}(770) and the f_0(500) resonances. Whereas for the former we obtain a\nlinear Regge trajectory, characteristic of ordinary quark-antiquark states, for\nthe latter we find a non-linear trajectory with a much smaller slope at the\nresonance mass. This provides a strong indication of the non-ordinary nature of\nthe sigma meson.\n", "  If Lorentz symmetry is broken, it must have occurred dynamically, via a\nvector or tensor field whose potential energy forces it to take on a non-zero\nbackground expectation value \"in vacuum\". If the set of minima of this\npotential (the vacuum manifold) has a non-trivial topology, then there can\narise topological defects: stable solutions in which the field approaches\ndifferent potential minima as we go to infinity in different directions. I\ndiscuss the current status of research into these topological defects in the\ncontext of Lorentz symmetry breaking, including recent results concerning the\nbirefringent light-bending of monopole solutions, and the search for models\nsupporting cosmic-string and domain-wall defects.\n", "  We report on the observation of a change in the bend angle of an RNA kissing\ncomplex upon Rop binding using single-molecular-pair FRET. The angular\nrelationship between the dyes, rather than the distance between them, is shown\nto be responsible for the observed change in energy transfer. It has long been\nthought that Rop increases the bend angle of the R1inv-R2inv complex upon\nbinding, but this has never been directly observed. In contrast, we find an\nincrease in FRET upon the addition of Rop that is shown via modeling to be\nconsistent with a decrease in the bend angle of the complex of\n$-15^{\\circ}\\pm7^{\\circ}$. The model predicts FRET from dye trajectories\ngenerated using molecular dynamics simulations of Cy3 and Cy5 attached to $5'$\nterminal cytosine or guanosine on RNA. While FRET is commonly used to observe\nglobal changes in molecular structure attributed to changes in the distance\nbetween dyes, it is rarely, if ever, used to elucidate angular changes. Subtle\nglobal changes in molecular structure upon binding are generally difficult to\ndiscern using NMR or crystallography, but FRET is well suited to observe these\nchanges because of its sensitivity at interdye distance around the F\\\"orster\nradius, $R_F\\approx5$ nm. While FRET is often referred to and used as a\n\"molecular ruler\" for distances around $R_F$, for dye pairs that have minimal\nrotational freedom, FRET can also be used to observe changes in structure for\nwhich there is no significant change in distance between the dyes. This is the\ncase for the R1inv-R2inv kissing complex studied here. This complex is derived\nfrom the RNA I - RNA II complex in E. coli. RNA II is a primer for replication\nof the ColE1 plasmid, its function is modulated by interaction with RNA II. Rop\nis known to stabilize the complex, and it is also known to bind kissing\ncomplexes in a structure, but not sequence, dependent fashion.\n", "  Noise correlation analysis is a detection tool for spatial structures and\nspatial correlations in the in-trap density distribution of ultracold atoms. In\nthis book chapter, we discuss the implementation, properties and limitations of\nthe method applied to ensembles of ultracold atoms in optical lattices, and\ndescribe some instances where it has been applied.\n", "  Europe monitors transits using radiation detectors to prevent illicit\ntrafficking of nuclear materials. The SCINTILLA project aims to develop a\ntoolbox of innovative technologies designed to address different usage cases.\nThis article will review the scope, approach, results of the first benchmark\ncampaign and future plans of the SCINTILLA project.\n", "  The ASTRI project aims to develop, in the framework of the Cherenkov\nTelescope Array, an end-to-end prototype of the small-size telescope, devoted\nto the investigation of the energy range ~ 1-100 TeV. The proposed design is\ncharacterized by two challenging but innovative technological solutions which\nwill be adopted for the first time on a Cherenkov telescope: a dual-mirror\nSchwarzschild-Couder configuration and a modular, light and compact camera\nbased on Silicon photo-multipliers. Here we describe the prototype design, the\nexpected performance and the possibility to realize a mini array composed by a\nfew such telescopes, which shall be placed at the final CTA Southern Site.\n", "  We report an analysis of the octet baryon masses using the covariant baryon\nchiral perturbation theory up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order with and\nwithout the virtual decuplet contributions. Particular attention is paid to the\nfinite-volume corrections and the finite lattice spacing effects on the baryon\nmasses. A reasonable description of all the publicly available $n_f=2+1$\nlattice QCD data is achieved.Utilyzing the Feynman-Hellmann theorem, we\ndetermine the nucleon sigma terms as $\\sigma_{\\pi N}=55(1)(4)$ MeV and\n$\\sigma_{sN}=27(27)(4)$ MeV.\n", "  The interaction potentials between vector mesons and octet baryons are\ncalculated explicitly with a summation of t-, s-, u-channel diagrams and a\ncontact term originating from the tensor interaction. Many resonances are\ngenerated dynamically in different channels of strangeness zero by solving the\ncoupled-channel Lippman-Schwinger equations with the method of partial wave\nanalysis, and their total angular momenta are determined. The spin partners\nN(1650)1/2^{-} and N(1700)3/2^-, N(1895)1/2^{-} and N(1875)3/2^-, and the state\nN(2120)3/2^- are all produced respectively in the isospin I=1/2 sector. In the\nisospin I=3/2 sector, the spin partners Delta(1620)1/2^- and Delta(1700)3/2^-\nare also associated with the pole in the complex energy plane. According to the\ncalculation results, a J^P=1/2^- state around 2000 MeV is predicted as the spin\npartner of N(2120)3/2^-. Some resonances are well fitted with their\ncounterparts listed in the newest review of Particle Data Group(PDG), while\nothers might stimulate the experimental observation in these energy regions in\nthe future.\n", "  We introduce a systematic approach to design all-passive subwavelength high\nperformance metasurfaces that exhibit nonreciprocal properties and achieve\nwave-flow isolation. Moreover we build upon those findings and propose a new\nparadigm for a quasi-2D metasurface that mimic the nonreciprocal property of\nFaraday rotation without using any magnetic or electric biasing. We envision\nthat the proposed approaches may serve as a building block for all-passive\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking with potential applications for future\nnonreciprocal systems and devices.\n", "  Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we examine the quenching of satellite\ngalaxies around isolated Milky Way-like hosts in the local Universe. We find\nthat the efficiency of satellite quenching around isolated galaxies is low and\nroughly constant over two orders of magnitude in satellite stellar mass\n($M_{*}$ = $10^{8.5}-10^{10.5} \\, M_{\\odot}$), with only $\\sim~20\\%$ of systems\nquenched as a result of environmental processes. While largely independent of\nsatellite stellar mass, satellite quenching does exhibit clear dependence on\nthe properties of the host. We show that satellites of passive hosts are\nsubstantially more likely to be quenched than those of star-forming hosts, and\nwe present evidence that more massive halos quench their satellites more\nefficiently. These results extend trends seen previously in more massive host\nhalos and for higher satellite masses. Taken together, it appears that galaxies\nwith stellar masses larger than about $10^{8}~M_{\\odot}$ are uniformly\nresistant to environmental quenching, with the relative harshness of the host\nenvironment likely serving as the primary driver of satellite quenching. At\nlower stellar masses ($< 10^{8}~M_{\\odot}$), however, observations of the Local\nGroup suggest that the vast majority of satellite galaxies are quenched,\npotentially pointing towards a characteristic satellite mass scale below which\nquenching efficiency increases dramatically.\n", "  Spin-glass theory is one of the leading paradigms of complex physics and\ndescribes condensed matter, neural networks and biological systems, ultracold\natoms, random photonics, and many other research fields. According to this\ntheory, identical systems under identical conditions may reach different states\nand provide different values for observable quantities. This effect is known as\nReplica Symmetry Breaking and is revealed by the shape of the probability\ndistribution function of an order parameter named the Parisi overlap. However,\na direct experimental evidence in any field of research is still missing. Here\nwe investigate pulse-to-pulse fluctuations in random lasers, we introduce and\nmeasure the analogue of the Parisi overlap in independent experimental\nrealizations of the same disordered sample, and we find that the distribution\nfunction yields evidence of a transition to a glassy light phase compatible\nwith a replica symmetry breaking.\n", "  This is a sketch of a 321D approximation for stellar convection which is\nnonlocal, and thus has nonzero fluxes of KE (to be published in more detail\nelsewhere). Boundary conditions are discussed in a fluid dynamics context\n(i.e., predictions for overshoot, semiconvection and entrainment are analyzed).\nWe plan to add this as an option to MESA. Inclusion of KE fluxes seems to help\nresolve the solar abundance problem (Asplund 2009). Smaller cores may ease the\nexplosion problems with core collapse supernova simulations.\n", "  Modern cosmic ray experiments consisting of large array of particle detectors\nmeasure the signals of electromagnetic or muon components or their combination.\nThe correction for an amount of atmosphere passed is applied to the surface\ndetector signal before its conversion to the shower energy. Either Monte Carlo\nbased approach assuming certain composition of primaries or indirect estimation\nusing real data and assuming isotropy of arrival directions can be used. Toy\nsurface arrays of different sensitivities to electromagnetic and muon\ncomponents are assumed in MC simulations to study effects imposed on\nattenuation curves for varying composition or possible high energy anisotropy.\nThe possible sensitivity of the attenuation curve to the mass composition is\nalso tested for different array types focusing on a future apparatus that can\nseparate muon and electromagnetic component signals.\n", "  We consider static cylindrically symmetric charged gravitating object with\nperfect fluid and investigate the gravitational binding energy. It is found\nthat only the localized part of the mass function provides the gravitational\nbinding energy, whereas the non-localized part generated by the electric\ncoupling does not contribute for such energy.\n", "  On April 30th 2008, the journal Nature announced that the missing circuit\nelement, postulated thirty-seven years before by Professor Leon O. Chua has\nbeen found. Thus, after the capacitor, the resistor and the inductor, the\nexistence of a fourth fundamental element of electronic circuits called\n\"memristor\" was established. In order to point out the importance of such a\ndiscovery, the aim of this article is first to propose an overview of the\nmanner with which the three others have been invented during the past\ncenturies. Then, a comparison between the main properties of the singing arc,\ni.e. a forerunner device of the triode used in Wireless Telegraphy, and that of\nthe memristor will enable to state that the singing arc could be considered as\nthe oldest memristor.\n", "  The Verlet method is still widely used to integrate the equations of motion\nin ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the stability limit\nof the Verlet method may be significantly increased by setting an upper limit\non the kinetic energy of each atom with only a small loss in accuracy. The\nvalidity of this approach is demonstrated for molten lithium fluoride.\n", "  This book chapter gives an introduction to, and an overview of, methods for\ncooling trapped ions. The main addressees are researchers entering the field.\nIt is not intended as a comprehensive survey and historical account of the\nextensive literature on this topic. We present the physical ideas behind\nseveral cooling schemes, outline their mathematical description, and point to\nrelevant literature useful for a more in-depth study of this topic.\n", "  We propose to use high-energy exclusive reactions for probing internal\nstructure of exotic hadron candidates. First, the constituent counting rule of\nperturbative QCD can be used for finding internal configurations of an exotic\nhadron candidate. It is because the number of constituents ($n$), which\nparticipate in the exclusive reaction, is found by the scaling behavior of the\ncross section $d\\sigma/dt \\propto 1/s^{n-2}$ at large momentum transfer, where\n$s$ is the center-of-mass energy squared. As an example, we show that the\ninternal structure of $\\Lambda \\, (1405)$ should be found, for example, by the\nreaction $\\pi^- + p \\to K^0 + \\Lambda (1405)$. Second, the internal structure\nof exotic hadron candidates should be investigated by hadron tomography with\ngeneralized parton distributions (GPDs) and generalized distribution amplitudes\n(GDAs) in exclusive reactions. Exotic nature should be reflected in the GPDs\nwhich contain two factors, longitudinal parton distributions as indicated by\nthe constituent counting rule and transverse form factors as suggested by the\nhadron size. The GDAs should be investigated by the two-photon process\n$\\gamma^* \\gamma \\to h\\bar h$, for example $h=f_0$ or $a_0$, in\nelectron-positron annihilation. Since the GDAs contain information on a\ntime-like form factor, exotic nature should be found by studying the $h\\bar h$\ninvariant mass dependence of the cross section. The internal structure of\nexotic hadron candidates should be clarified by the exclusive reactions at\nfacilities such as J-PARC and KEKB.\n", "  Perturbative calculations in quantum field theory often require the\nregularization of infrared divergences. In quantum electrodynamics, such a\nregularization can for example be accomplished by a photon mass introduced via\nthe Stueckelberg method. The present work extends this method to the QED limit\nof the Lorentz- and CPT-violating Standard-Model Extension.\n", "  We study representations of the quantum affine superalgebra associated with a\ngeneral linear Lie superalgebra. In the spirit of Hernandez-Jimbo, we construct\ninductive systems of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules based on a cyclicity result\nthat we established previously on tensor products of these modules, and realize\ntheir inductive limits as modules over its Borel subalgebra, the so-called\n$q$-Yangian. A new generic asymptotic limit of the same inductive systems is\nproposed, resulting in modules over the full quantum affine superalgebra. We\nderive generalized Baxter's relations in the sense of Frenkel-Hernandez for\nrepresentations of the full quantum group.\n", "  This study presents the advancement in hydrophobic silica aerogel development\nfor use as Cherenkov radiators and muonium production targets. These devices\nare scheduled for use in several particle- and nuclear-physics experiments that\nare planned in the near future at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research\nComplex. Our conventional method to produce aerogel tiles with an intermediate\nindex of refraction of approximately 1.05 is extended so that we can now\nproduce aerogel tiles with lower indices of refraction (i.e., 1.03-1.04) and\nhigher indices of refraction (i.e., 1.075-1.08); each with excellent\ntransparency. A new production method, called pin drying, was optimized to\nproduce larger area aerogels consistently with an ultrahigh index of refraction\n(>1.10). In addition, for use as a thermal-muonium-emitting material at room\ntemperature, dedicated low-density aerogels were fabricated using the\nconventional method.\n", "  We briefly review recent progress on ultracold atomic Fermi gases with\ndifferent types of synthetic spin-orbit coupling, including the one-dimensional\n(1D) equal weight Rashba-Dresselhaus and two-dimensional (2D) Rasbha spin-orbit\ncouplings. Theoretically, we show how the single-body, two-body and many-body\nproperties of Fermi gases are dramatically changed by spin-orbit coupling. In\nparticular, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and interatomic\ninteraction may lead to several long-sought exotic superfluid phases at low\ntemperatures, such as anisotropic superfluid, topological superfluid and\ninhomogeneous superfluid. Experimentally, only the first type - equal weight\ncombination of Rasbha and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings - has been realized\nvery recently using a two-photon Raman process. We show how to characterize a\nnormal spin-orbit coupled atomic Fermi gas in both non-interacting and\nstrongly-interacting limits, using particularly momentum-resolved\nradio-frequency spectroscopy. The experimental demonstration of a\nstrongly-interacting spin-orbit coupled Fermi gas opens a promising way to\nobserve various exotic superfluid phases in the near future.\n", "  Recently the concept of compositeness has been developed so as to distinguish\nwhether interested hadrons are hadronic molecules or not. Here, in terms of\ncompositeness, we investigate $\\bar{K} N$ molecular structure of the $\\Lambda\n(1405)$ resonance with the $\\Lambda (1405)$ radiative decay and $K \\bar{K}$\nmolecular structure of the $a_{0} (980)$ and $f_{0} (980)$ resonances with the\n$a_{0} (980)$-$f_{0} (980)$ mixing.\n", "  Following the finite-temperature ab initio calculation framework based on the\nrelativistic disordered local moments, we computationally demonstrate the\npossibility of doping-enhanced coercivity at high-temperatures, taking YCo$_5$\nas a working material in order to extract the $3d$-electron part of the\nelectronic structure of the rare-earth permanent magnets. Alkaline-earth\ndopants are shown to be the candidates to realize the proposed phenomenon.\n", "  We discuss how to implement, in lattice gauge theories, external charges\nwhich are not commensurate with an elementary gauge coupling. It is shown that\nan arbitrary, real power of a standard Wilson loop (or Polyakov line) can be\ndefined and consistently computed in lattice formulation of non-abelian, two\ndimensional gauge theories. However, such an observable can excite quantum\nstates with integer fluxes only. Since the non-integer fluxes are not in the\nspectrum of the theory they cannot be created, no matter which observable is\nchosen. Also the continuum limit of above averages does not exist unless the\npowers in question are in fact integer. On the other hand, a new continuum\nlimit exists, which is rather intuitive, and where above observables make\nperfect sense and lead to the string tension proportional to the square of\narbitrary (non necessary commensurate with gauge coupling) charge.\n", "  There is a growing array of supermassive black hole and nuclear star cluster\nscaling relations with their host spheroid, including a bent (black hole\nmass)-(host spheroid mass) M_bh-M_sph relation and different (massive compact\nobject mass)-(host spheroid velocity dispersion) M_mco-sigma relations for\nblack holes and nuclear star clusters. By combining the observed M_bh ~\nsigma^(5.5) relation with the observed M_nc ~ sigma^(1.6--2.7) relation, we\nderive the expression M_bh ~ (M_nc)^(2--3.4), which should hold until the\nnuclear star clusters are eventually destroyed in the larger core-Sersic\nspheroids. This new mass scaling relation helps better quantify the rapid\nevolutionary growth of massive black holes in dense star clusters, and the\nrelation is consistently recovered when coupling the observed M_nc ~\n(M_sph)^(0.6--1.0) relation with the recently observed quadratic relation M_bh\n~ (M_sph)^2 for Sersic spheroids.\n", "  Just as classical information systems require buffers and memory, the same is\ntrue for quantum information systems. The potential that optical quantum\ninformation processing holds for revolutionising computation and communication\nis therefore driving significant research into developing optical quantum\nmemory. A practical optical quantum memory must be able to store and recall\nquantum states on demand with high efficiency and low noise. Ideally, the\nplatform for the memory would also be simple and inexpensive. Here, we present\na complete tomographic reconstruction of quantum states that have been stored\nin the ground states of rubidium in a vapour cell operating at around 80$^o$C.\nWithout conditional measurements, we show recall fidelity up to 98% for\ncoherent pulses containing around one photon. In order to unambiguously verify\nthat our memory beats the quantum no-cloning limit we employ state independent\nverification using conditional variance and signal transfer coefficients.\n", "  First-principles density functional theory studies have been carried out for\nnative defects and transition-metal (Ti and Ni) impurities in lithium alanate\n(LiAlH$_{4}$), a potential material for hydrogen storage. On the basis of our\ndetailed analysis of the structure, energetics, and migration of lithium-,\naluminum-, and hydrogen-related defects, we propose a specific atomistic\nmechanism for the decomposition and dehydrogenation of LiAlH$_{4}$ that\ninvolves mass transport mediated by native point defects. We also discuss how\nTi and Ni impurities alter the Fermi-level position with respect to that in the\nundoped material, thus changing the concentration of charged defects that are\nresponsible for mass transport. This mechanism provides an explanation for the\nexperimentally observed lowering of the temperature for the onset of\ndecomposition and of the activation energy for hydrogen desorption from\nLiAlH$_{4}$.\n", "  Characterizing the nature of single-particle states outside of double shell\nclosures is essential to a fundamental understanding of nuclear structure. This\nis especially true for those doubly magic nuclei that lie far from stability\nand where the shell closures influence nucleo-synthetic pathways. The region\naround $^{100}$Sn is one of the most important due to the proximity of the\nN=Z=50 magic numbers, the proton-drip line, and the end of the rp-process.\nHowever, owing to the low production rates, there is a lack of spectroscopic\ninformation and no firm spin-parity assignment for ground states of odd-A\nisotopes close to $^{100}$Sn. Neutron knockout reaction experiments on beams of\n$^{108,106}$Sn and $^{106}$Cd have been performed at the NSCL. By measuring\ngamma rays and momentum distributions from reaction residues, the spin of\nground state and first excited state for $^{107,105}$Sn have been established.\nThe results also show a degree of mixing in the ground states of the isotopes\n$^{108,106}$Sn between the d$_{5/2}$ and g$_{7/2}$ single particle-states and\nthey are compared to reaction calculations. Single-, double-, and\ntriple-neutron knockout reactions on the $^{106}$Cd beam have been observed.\nThe spin-parity of $^{105}$Cd is already known, therefore, the measurement of\nthe momentum distributions of the ground and first excited states of this\nresidue is an important validation of the technique used for the light tin\nisotopes.\n", "  In the solar neighborhood, where the typical relaxation timescale is larger\nthan the cosmic age, at least 10\\% to 15\\% of Sun-like stars have planetary\nsystems with Jupiter-mass planets. In contrast, dense star clusters,\ncharactered by frequent close encounters, have been found to host very few\nplanets. We carry out numerical simulations with different initial conditions\nto investigate the dynamical stability of planetary systems in star cluster\nenvironments.\n", "  Almost all galaxies along the Hubble sequence host a compact massive object\n(CMO) in their center. The CMO can be either a supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nor a very dense stellar cluster, also known as nuclear star cluster (NSC).\nGenerally, heavier galaxies (mass $\\gtrsim 10^{11}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ ) host a\ncentral SMBH while lighter show a central NSC. Intermediate mass hosts,\ninstead, contain both a NSC and a SMBH. One possible formation mechanisms of a\nNSC relies on the dry-merger (migratory) scenario, in which globular clusters\n(GCs) decay toward the center of the host galaxy and merge. In this framework,\nthe absence of NSCs in high-mass galaxies can be imputed to destruction of the\ninfalling GCs by the intense tidal field of the central SMBH. In this work, we\nreport preliminary results of N-body simulations performed using our\nhigh-resolution, direct, code HiGPUs, to investigate the effects of a central\nSMBH on a single GC orbiting around it. By varying either the mass of the SMBH\nand the mass of the host galaxy, we derived an upper limit to the mass of the\ncentral SMBH, and thus to the mass of the host, above which the formation of a\nNSC is suppressed.\n", "  We model numerically the evolution of $10^4M_\\odot$ turbulent molecular\nclouds in near-radial infall onto $10^6M_\\odot$, equal-mass super-massive black\nhole binaries, using a modified version of the SPH code GADGET-3. We\ninvestigate the different gas structures formed depending on the relative\ninclination between the binary and the cloud orbits. Our first results indicate\nthat an aligned orbit produces mini-discs around each black hole, almost\naligned with the binary; a perpendicular orbit produces misaligned mini-discs;\nand a counter-aligned orbit produces a circumbinary, counter-rotating ring.\n", "  The detection of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) in globular clusters\nhas been hotly debated, with different observational methods delivering\ndifferent outcomes for the same object. In order to understand these\ndiscrepancies, we construct detailed mock integral field spectroscopy (IFU)\nobservations of globular clusters, starting from realistic Monte Carlo cluster\nsimulations. The output is a data cube of spectra in a given field-of-view that\ncan be analyzed in the same manner as real observations and compared to other\n(resolved) kinematic measurement methods. We show that the main discrepancies\narise because the luminosity-weighted IFU observations can be strongly biased\nby the presence of a few bright stars that introduce a scatter in velocity\ndispersion measurements of several km/s. We show that this intrinsic scatter\ncan prevent a sound assessment of the central kinematics, and therefore should\nbe fully taken into account to correctly interpret the signature of an IMBH.\n", "  Legislators, designers of legal information systems, as well as citizens face\noften problems due to the interdependence of the laws and the growing number of\nreferences needed to interpret them. Quantifying this complexity is not an easy\ntask. In this paper, we introduce the \"Legislation Network\" as a novel approach\nto address related problems. We have collected an extensive data set of a more\nthan 60-year old legislation corpus, as published in the Official Journal of\nthe European Union, and we further analysed it as a complex network, thus\ngaining insight into its topological structure. Among other issues, we have\nperformed a temporal analysis of the evolution of the Legislation Network, as\nwell as a robust resilience test to assess its vulnerability under specific\ncases that may lead to possible breakdowns. Results are quite promising,\nshowing that our approach can lead towards an enhanced explanation in respect\nto the structure and evolution of legislation properties.\n", "  Finding an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in a globular cluster (GC), or\nproving its absence, is a crucial ingredient in our understanding of galaxy\nformation and evolution. The challenge is to identify a unique signature of an\nIMBH that cannot be accounted for by other processes. Observational claims of\nIMBH detection are often based on analyses of the kinematics of stars, such as\na rise in the velocity dispersion profile towards the centre. In this\ncontribution we discuss the degeneracy between this IMBH signal and pressure\nanisotropy in the GC. We show that that by considering anisotropic models it is\npossible to partially explain the innermost shape of the projected velocity\ndispersion profile, even though models that do not account for an IMBH do not\nexhibit a cusp in the centre.\n", "  Nuclear stellar cluster (NSCs) are known to exist around massive black holes\n(MBHs) in galactic nuclei. Two formation scenarios were suggested for their\norigin: Build-up of NSCs and Continuous in-situ star-formation. Here we study\nthe effects of star formation on the build-up of NSCs and its implications for\ntheir long term evolution and their resulting structure. We show that\ncontinuous star-formation can lead to the build-up of an NSC with properties\nsimilar to those of the Milky-way NSC. We also find that the general structure\nof the old stellar population in the NSC with in-situ star-formation could be\nvery similar to the steady-state Bahcall-Wolf cuspy structure. However, its\nyounger stellar population do not yet achieve a steady state. In\nparticular,formed/evolved NSCs with in-situ star-formation contain differential\nage-segregated stellar populations which are not yet fully mixed. Younger\nstellar populations formed in the outer regions of the NSC have a cuspy\nstructure towards the NSC outskirts, while showing a core-like distribution\ninwards; with younger populations having larger core sizes.\n", "  We consider a two-dimensional Dirac oscillator in the presence of magnetic\nfield in noncommutative phase space in the framework of relativistic quantum\nmechanics with minimal length. The problem in question is identified with a\nPoschl-Teller potential. The eigenvalues are found and the corresponding wave\nfunctions are calculated in terms of hypergeometric functions.\n", "  The study of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is a young and promising\nfield of research. Formed by runaway collisions of massive stars in young and\ndense stellar clusters, intermediate-mass black holes could still be present in\nthe centers of globular clusters, today. Our group investigated the presence of\nintermediate-mass black holes for a sample of 10 Galactic globular clusters. We\nmeasured the inner kinematic profiles with integral-field spectroscopy and\ndetermined masses or upper limits of central black holes in each cluster. In\ncombination with literature data we further studied the positions of our\nresults on known black-hole scaling relations (such as M_bh - sigma) and found\na similar but flatter correlation for IMBHs. Applying cluster evolution codes,\nthe change in the slope could be explained with the stellar mass loss occurring\nin clusters in a tidal field over its life time. Furthermore, we present\nresults from several numerical simulations on the topic of IMBHs and integral\nfield units (IFUs). We ran N-body simulations of globular clusters containing\nIMBHs in a tidal field and studied their effects on mass-loss rates and remnant\nfractions and showed that an IMBH in the center prevents core collapse and\nejects massive objects more rapidly. These simulations were further used to\nsimulate IFU data cubes. For the specific case of NGC 6388 we simulated two\ndifferent IFU techniques and found that velocity dispersion measurements from\nindividual velocities are strongly biased towards lower values due to blends of\nneighbouring stars and background light. In addition, we use the Astrophysical\nMultipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE) to combine gravitational physics,\nstellar evolution and hydrodynamics to simulate the accretion of stellar winds\nonto a black hole.\n", "  The emerging paradigm of abundant-data computing requires real-time analytics\non enormous quantities of data collected by a mushrooming network of sensors.\nTodays computing technology, however, cannot scale to satisfy such big data\napplications with the required throughput and energy efficiency. The next\ntechnology frontier will be monolithically integrated chips with three\ndimensionally interleaved memory and logic for unprecedented data bandwidth\nwith reduced energy consumption. In this work, we exploit the atomically thin\nnature of the graphene edge to assemble a resistive memory stacked in a\nvertical three dimensional structure. We report some of the lowest power and\nenergy consumption among the emerging non-volatile memories due to an extremely\nthin electrode with unique properties, low programming voltages, and low\ncurrent. Circuit analysis of the architecture using experimentally measured\ndevice properties show higher storage potential for graphene devices compared\nthat of metal based devices.\n", "  Because of its nearness to Earth, the centre of the Milky Way is the only\ngalaxy nucleus in which we can study the characteristics, distribution,\nkinematics, and dynamics of the stars on milli-parsec scales. We have accurate\nand precise measurements of the Galactic centre's central black hole,\nSagittarius A*, and can study its interaction with the surrounding nuclear star\ncluster in detail. This contribution aims at providing a concise overview of\nour current knowledge about the Milky Way's central black hole and nuclear star\ncluster, at highlighting the observational challenges and limitations, and at\ndiscussing some of the current key areas of investigation.\n", "  Several attractive properties of hydrocarbon-linked mesogenic dimers have\nbeen discovered, a major feature of these has been the ability of dimers under\nconfinement to form periodic patterns. At least six different types of\nstripe-like periodic patterns can be observed in these materials under various\nexperimental conditions. Our most recent finding is the discovery of\nmicrometre-scale periodic patterns at the N-Ntb phase transition interface, and\nsub-micrometre scale patterns in the Ntb phase. Layer-like sub-micrometre\npatterns were observed using three-photon excitation fluorescence polarizing\nmicroscopy, and these are being reported here.\n", "  We find a superradiant quantum phase transition in the model of triangular\nmolecular magnets coupled to the electric component of a microwave cavity\nfield. The transition occurs when the coupling strength exceeds a critical\nvalue which, in sharp contrast to the standard two-level emitters, can be tuned\nby an external magnetic field. In addition to emitted radiation, the molecules\ndevelop an in-plane electric dipole moment at the transition. We estimate that\nthe transition can be detected in state of the art microwave strip-line\ncavities containing $10^{15}$ molecules.\n", "  I present an overview of our ongoing project aimed at building a new\ngeneration of velocity dispersion profiles ad rotation curves for a\nrepresentative sample of Galactic globular clusters, from the the radial\nvelocity of hundreds individual stars distributed at different distances from\nthe cluster center. The innermost portion of the profiles will be used to\nconstrain the possibile presence of intermediate-mass black holes. The adopted\nmethodology consists in combining spectroscopic observations acquired with\nthree different instruments at the ESO-VLT: the adaptive-optics assisted,\nintegral field unit (IFU) spectrograph SINFONI for the innermost and highly\ncrowded cluster cores, the multi-IFU spectrograph KMOS for the intermediate\nregions, and the multi-fiber instrument FLAMES/GIRAFFE-MEDUSA for the\noutskirts. The case of NGC 6388, representing the pilot project that motivated\nthe entire program, is described in some details.\n", "  In this paper I present an overview of the main observational properties of a\nspecial class of exotic objects (the so-called Blue Straggler Stars, BSSs) in\nGalactic Globular Clusters (GCs). The BSS specific frequency and their radial\ndistribution are discussed in the framework of using this stellar population as\nprobe of GC internal dynamics. In particular, the shape of the BSS radial\ndistribution has been found to be a powerful tracer of the dynamical evolution\nof stellar systems, thus allowing the definition of an empirical \"clock\" able\nto measure the dynamical age of stellar aggregates from pure observational\nproperties.\n", "  Using hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the use of the mean and\npercentiles of the curvature distribution function to recover the equation of\nstate of the high-$z$ ($2 < z < 4$) intergalactic medium (IGM). We find that\nthe mean and percentiles of the absolute curvature distribution exhibit tight\ncorrelation with the temperatures measured at respective characteristic\noverdensities $\\bar{\\Delta}_i$'s at each redshift. Hence, they provide\ncomplementary probes of the same underlying temperature-density distribution,\nand can in principle be used to simultaneously recover both parameters $T_0$\nand $\\gamma$ of the IGM effective equation of state. We quantify the associated\nerrors in the recovered parameters $T_0$ and $\\gamma$ from the intrinsic\nscatter in the characteristic overdensities and the uncertainties in the\ncurvature measurement.\n", "  The capture and disruption of stars by supermassive black holes (SMBHs), and\nthe formation and coalescence of binaries, are inevitable consequences of the\npresence of SMBHs at the cores of galaxies. Pairs of active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) and binary SMBHs are important stages in the evolution of galaxy mergers,\nand an intense search for these systems is currently ongoing. In the early and\nadvanced stages of galaxy merging, observations of the triggering of accretion\nonto one or both BHs inform us about feedback processes and BH growth.\nIdentification of the compact binary SMBHs at parsec and sub-parsec scales\nprovides us with important constraints on the interaction processes that govern\nthe shrinkage of the binary beyond the \"final parsec\". Coalescing binary SMBHs\nare among the most powerful sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the\nuniverse. Stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) appear as luminous, transient,\naccretion flares when part of the stellar material is accreted by the SMBH.\nAbout 30 events have been identified by multi-wavelength observations by now,\nand they will be detected in the thousands in future ground-based or\nspace-based transient surveys. The study of TDEs provides us with a variety of\nnew astrophysical tools and applications, related to fundamental physics or\nastrophysics. Here, we provide a review of the current status of observations\nof SMBH pairs and binaries, and TDEs, and discuss astrophysical implications.\n", "  We present an analysis of the optical nuclear spectra from the active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) in a sample of giant low surface brightness (GLSB)\ngalaxies. GLSB galaxies are extreme late type spirals that are large, isolated\nand poorly evolved compared to regular spiral galaxies. Earlier studies have\nindicated that their nuclei have relatively low mass black holes. Using data\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we selected a sample of 30 GLSB\ngalaxies that showed broad H$\\alpha$ emission lines in their AGN spectra. In\nsome galaxies such as UGC 6284, the broad component of H$\\alpha$ is more\nrelated to outflows rather than the black hole. One galaxy (UGC 6614) showed\ntwo broad components in H$\\alpha$, one associated with the black hole and the\nother associated with an outflow event. We derived the nuclear black hole (BH)\nmasses of 29 galaxies from their broad H$\\alpha$ parameters. We find that the\nnuclear BH masses lie in the range $10^{5}-10^{7} M_{\\odot}$. The bulge stellar\nvelocity dispersion $\\sigma_{e}$ was determined from the underlying stellar\nspectra. We compared our results with the existing BH mass - velocity\ndispersion ($M_{BH}-\\sigma_{e}$) correlations and found that the majority of\nour sample lie in the low BH mass regime and below the $M_{BH}-\\sigma_{e}$\ncorrelation. The effects of galaxy orientation in the measurement of $\\sigma_e$\nand the increase of $\\sigma_e$ due to the effects of bar are probable reasons\nfor the observed offset for some galaxies, but in many galaxies the offset is\nreal. A possible explanation for the $M_{BH}-\\sigma_{e}$ offset could be lack\nof mergers and accretion events in the history of these galaxies which leads to\na lack of BH-bulge co-evolution. \\keywords{galaxies: active, galaxies: bulges,\ngalaxies: nuclei}\n", "  An R-matrix model for three-body final states is presented and applied to a\nrecent measurement of the neutron energy spectrum from the T+T->2n+alpha\nreaction. The calculation includes the n-alpha and n-n interactions in the\nfinal state, angular momentum conservation, antisymmetrization, and the\ninterference between different channels. A good fit to the measured spectrum is\nobtained, where clear evidence for the 5He ground state is observed. The model\nis also used to predict the alpha-particle spectrum from T+T as well as\nparticle spectra from 3He+3He. The R-matrix approach presented here is very\ngeneral, and can be adapted to a wide variety of problems with three-body final\nstates.\n", "  We report on GalevNB (Galev for N-Body simulations), an integrated software\nsolution that provides N-body users direct access to the software package GALEV\n(GALaxy EVolutionary synthesis models). GalevNB is developed for the purpose of\na direct comparison between N-body simulations and observations. It converts\nthe fundamental stellar properties of N-body simulations, i.e., stellar mass,\ntemperature, stellar luminosity and metallicity, into observational magnitudes\nfor a variety of filters of widely used instruments/telescopes (HST, ESO, SDSS,\n2MASS), and into spectra that span from far-UV (90 $\\rm \\AA$) to near-IR (160\n$\\rm \\mu$m).\n", "  We review the analytical prescriptions in the literature to model the 21-cm\n(emission line surveys/intensity mapping experiments) and Damped Lyman-Alpha\n(DLA) observations of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the post-reionization universe.\nWhile these two sets of prescriptions have typically been applied separately\nfor the two probes, we attempt to connect these approaches to explore the\nconsequences for the distribution and evolution of HI across redshifts. We find\nthat a physically motivated, 21-cm based prescription, extended to account for\nthe DLA observables provides a good fit to the majority of the available data,\nbut cannot accommodate the recent measurement of the clustering of DLAs at $z\n\\sim 2.3$. This highlights a tension between the DLA bias and the 21-cm\nmeasurements, unless there is a very significant change in the nature of\nHI-bearing systems across redshifts 0-3. We discuss the implications of our\nfindings for the characteristic host halo masses of the DLAs and the power\nspectrum of 21-cm intensity fluctuations.\n", "  GLEAM, the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA survey, is a survey of the\nentire radio sky south of declination +25 deg at frequencies between 72 and 231\nMHz, made with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) using a drift scan method\nthat makes efficient use of the MWA's very large field-of-view. We present the\nobservation details, imaging strategies and theoretical sensitivity for GLEAM.\nThe survey ran for two years, the first year using 40 kHz frequency resolution\nand 0.5 s time resolution; the second year using 10 kHz frequency resolution\nand 2 s time resolution. The resulting image resolution and sensitivity depends\non observing frequency, sky pointing and image weighting scheme. At 154 MHz the\nimage resolution is approximately 2.5 x 2.2/cos(DEC+26.7) arcmin with\nsensitivity to structures up to ~10 deg in angular size. We provide tables to\ncalculate the expected thermal noise for GLEAM mosaics depending on pointing\nand frequency and discuss limitations to achieving theoretical noise in Stokes\nI images. We discuss challenges, and their solutions, that arise for GLEAM\nincluding ionospheric effects on source positions and linearly polarised\nemission, and the instrumental polarisation effects inherent to the MWA's\nprimary beam.\n", "  We present an innovative method called FilExSeC (Filaments Extraction,\nSelection and Classification), a data mining tool developed to investigate the\npossibility to refine and optimize the shape reconstruction of filamentary\nstructures detected with a consolidated method based on the flux derivative\nanalysis, through the column-density maps computed from Herschel infrared\nGalactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL) observations of the Galactic plane. The present\nmethodology is based on a feature extraction module followed by a machine\nlearning model (Random Forest) dedicated to select features and to classify the\npixels of the input images. From tests on both simulations and real\nobservations the method appears reliable and robust with respect to the\nvariability of shape and distribution of filaments. In the cases of highly\ndefined filament structures, the presented method is able to bridge the gaps\namong the detected fragments, thus improving their shape reconstruction. From a\npreliminary \"a posteriori\" analysis of derived filament physical parameters,\nthe method appears potentially able to add a sufficient contribution to\ncomplete and refine the filament reconstruction.\n", "  We study the survival probability of moving relativistic unstable particles\nwith definite momentum $\\vec{p} \\neq 0$. The amplitude of the survival\nprobability of these particles is calculated using its integral representation.\nWe found decay curves of such particles for the quantum mechanical models\nconsidered. These model studies show that late time deviations of the survival\nprobability of these particles from the exponential form of the decay law, that\nis the transition times region between exponential and non-expo\\-nen\\-tial form\nof the survival probability, should occur much earlier than it follows from the\nclassical standard approach resolving itself into replacing time $t$ by\n$t/\\gamma$ (where $\\gamma$ is the relativistic Lorentz factor) in the formula\nfor the survival probability and that the survival probabilities should tend to\nzero as $t\\rightarrow \\infty$ much slower than one would expect using classical\ntime dilation relation. Here we show also that for some physically admissible\nmodels of unstable states the computed decay curves of the moving particles\nhave fluctuating form at relatively short times including times of order of the\nlifetime.\n", "  Several important measures of quantum correlations of a state of a\nfinite-dimensional composite system are defined as linear combinations of\nmarginal entropies of this state. This paper is devoted to the\ninfinite-dimensional generalizations of such quantities and to the analysis of\ntheir properties.\n  We introduce the notion of faithful extension of a linear combination of\nmarginal entropies and consider several concrete examples starting with the\nquantum mutual information and the quantum conditional entropy.\n  Then we show that the conditional mutual information can be uniquely defined\nas a lower semicontinuous function on the set of all states of a tripartite\ninfinite-dimensional system possessing all the basic properties valid in finite\ndimensions.\n  Infinite-dimensional generalizations of some other measures of quantum\ncorrelations in multipartite quantum systems are also considered. It is shown\nthat almost all of these generalized measures are globally lower semicontinuous\nand possess local continuity properties which essentially simplify their use in\nanalysis of quantum systems.\n  In the second part of the paper we consider applications of the general\nresults of its first part, in particular, to the theory of infinite-dimensional\nquantum channels and their capacities. We also show the existence of the\nFawzi-Renner recovery channel reproducing marginal states for all tripartite\nstates (including states with infinite marginal entropies) starting with the\ncorresponding finite-dimensional result.\n", "  It is known that an acoustic wave incident on an infinite array of aligned\nrectangular blocks of a different acoustic material exhibits total transmission\nif certain conditions are met [1] which relate the unique \"intromission\" angle\nof incidence with geometric and material properties of the slab. This\nextraordinary acoustic transmission phenomenon holds for any slab thickness,\nmaking it analogous to a Brewster effect in optics, and is independent of\nfrequency as long as the slab microstructure is sub-wavelength in the\nlength-wise direction. Here we show that the enhanced transmission effect is\nobtained in a slab with grating elements oriented obliquely to the slab normal.\nThe dependence of the intromission angle $\\theta_i$ is given explicitly in\nterms of the orientation angle. Total transmission is achieved at incidence\nangles $\\pm \\theta_i$, with a relative phase shift between the transmitted\namplitudes of the $+\\theta_i$ and $- \\theta_i$ cases. These effects are shown\nto follow from explicit formulas for the transmission coefficient. In the case\nof grating elements that are rigid the results have direct physical\ninterpretation. The analytical findings are illustrated with full wave\nsimulations.\n", "  The ratio between the anomalous magnetic moments of proton and neutron has\nrecently been suggested to be connected to the ratio of proton momentum\nfractions carried by valence quarks. This relation has been obtained within a\nparametrization of the Generalized Parton Distributions (GPD) \\cite{gpv}, but\nit is completely independent of such a parametrization.\\\\ It will be shown that\nusing different CQMs this relation holds within a few percent accuracy. This\nagreement is based on what all the CQMs have in common: the effective degrees\nof freedom of the three constituent quarks and the underlying SU(6) symmetry.\\\\\nOn the other hand, the experimental value of the ratio is not reproduced by\nCQMs. This means that the SU(6)-breaking mechanism contained in the\nphenomenological partonic distributions does not correspond to the SU(6)\nbreaking mechanism implemented in the CQMs we have analyzed \\cite{noi03}.\\\\ We\nwill also show how this relation can be used in order to understand in which\nway to implement an $SU(6)$-breaking mechanism and to test models.\n", "  The hypercentral CQM, which is inspired by Lattice QCD calculations for\nquark-antiquark potentials, is presented, stressing its underlying symmetry.\nIts results for the spectrum, the helicity amplitudes and the elastic form\nfactors are briefly reported. In the latter case the model has allowed to show,\nfor the first time in the framework of a quark model, that relativistic effects\nare responsible for a deviation from the usually accepted dipole behaviour, in\nagreement with recent data taken at the Jefferson Lab.\n", "  We analyze the process of thermalization, dynamics and the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis (ETH) for the single impurity Anderson model,\nfocusing on the Kondo regime. For this we construct the complete eigenbasis of\nthe Hamiltonian using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method in the\nlanguage of the matrix product states. It is a peculiarity of the NRG that\nwhile the Wilson chain is supposed to describe a macroscopic bath, very few\nsingle particle excitations already suffice to essentially thermalize the\nimpurity system at finite temperature, which amounts to having added a\nmacroscopic amount of energy. Thus given an initial state of the system such as\nthe ground state together with microscopic excitations, we calculate the\nspectral function of the impurity using the microcanonical and diagonal and\ngrand canonical ensembles. By adding or removing particles at a certain Wilson\nenergy shell on top of the ground state, we find qualitative agreement between\nthe spectral functions calculated for different ensembles. This indicates that\nthe system thermalizes in the long-time limit, and can be described by an\nappropriate statistical-mechanical ensemble. Moreover, by calculating the\nimpurity spectral density at the Fermi level and the dot occupancy for energy\neigenstates relevant for microcanonical ensemble, we find good support for ETH.\nThe ultimate mechanism responsible for this effective thermalization within the\nNRG can be identified as Anderson orthogonality: the more charge that needs to\nflow to or from infinity after applying a local excitation within the Wilson\nchain, the more the system looks thermal afterwards at an increased\ntemperature. For the same reason, however, thermalization fails if charge\nrearrangement after the excitation remains mostly local.\n", "  It has been shown recently [J. L. Lado et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 027203\n(2014)] that edge magnetic moments in graphene-like nanoribbons are strongly\ninfluenced by the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction. Due to this interaction an\nanisotropy comes about which makes the in-plane arrangement of magnetic moments\nenergetically more favorable than that corresponding to the out-of-plane\nconfiguration. In this paper we raise both the edge magnetism problem as well\nas differential conductance and shot noise Fano factor issues, in the context\nof finite-size flakes within the Coulomb blockade (CB) transport regime. Our\nfindings elucidate the following problems: (i) modification of the CB diamonds\nby the appearance of the in-plane magnetic moments, (ii) modification of the CB\ndiamonds by intrinsic spin-orbit interaction.\n", "  In this article we describe our studies of the sigma meson, f_0(500), using\ntwo-pion correlation functions. We use lattice quantum chromodynamics in the\nquenched approximation with so-called clover fermions. By working at unphysical\npion masses we are able to identify a would-be resonance with mass less than $2\nm_\\pi$, and then extrapolate to the physical point. We include the most\nimportant annihilation diagram, which is \"partially disconnnected\" or \"single\nannihilation.\" Because this diagram is quite expensive to compute, we introduce\na somewhat novel technique for the computation of all-to-all diagrams, based on\nmomentum sources and a truncation in momentum space. In practice, we use only\n${\\bf p}=0$ modes, so the method reduces to wall sources. At the point where\nthe mass of the pion takes its physical value, we find a resonance in the\n$0^{++}$ two-pion channel with a mass of approximately $609 \\pm 80$ MeV,\nconsistent with the expected properties of the sigma meson, given the\napproximations we are making.\n", "  We consider a 2D time-dependent quantum system of $N$-bosons with harmonic\nexternal confining and \\emph{attractive} interparticle interaction in the\nGross-Pitaevskii scaling. We derive stability of matter type estimates showing\nthat the $k$-th power of the energy controls the $H^{1}$ Sobolev norm of the\nsolution over $k$-particles. This estimate is new and more difficult for\nattractive interactions than repulsive interactions. For the proof, we use a\nversion of the finite-dimensional quantum di Finetti theorem from [49]. A high\nparticle-number averaging effect is at play in the proof, which is not needed\nfor the corresponding estimate in the repulsive case. This a priori bound\nallows us to prove that the corresponding BBGKY hierarchy converges to the GP\nlimit as was done in many previous works treating the case of repulsive\ninteractions. As a result, we obtain that the \\emph{focusing} nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation is the mean-field limit of the 2D time-dependent\nquantum many-body system with attractive interatomic interaction and\nasymptotically factorized initial data. An assumption on the size of the\n$L^{1}$-norm of the interatomic interaction potential is needed that\ncorresponds to the sharp constant in the 2D Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality\nthough the inequality is not directly relevant because we are dealing with a\ntrace instead of a power.\n", "  We summarise some of the recent progress in understanding the formation and\nevolution of globular clusters (GCs) in the context of galaxy formation and\nevolution. It is discussed that an end-to-end model for GC formation and\nevolution should capture four different phases: (1) star and cluster formation\nin the high-pressure interstellar medium of high-redshift galaxies, (2) cluster\ndisruption by tidal shocks in the gas-rich host galaxy disc, (3) cluster\nmigration into the galaxy halo, and (4) the final evaporation-dominated\nevolution of GCs until the present day. Previous models have mainly focussed on\nphase 4. We present and discuss a simple model that includes each of these four\nsteps - its key difference with respect to previous work is the simultaneous\naddition of the high-redshift formation and early evolution of young GCs, as\nwell as their migration into galaxy haloes. The new model provides an excellent\nmatch to the observed GC mass spectrum and specific frequency, as well as the\nrelations of GCs to the host dark matter halo mass and supermassive black hole\nmass. These results show (1) that the properties of present-day GCs are\nreproduced by assuming that they are the natural outcome of regular\nhigh-redshift star formation (i.e. they form according to same physical\nprocesses that govern massive cluster formation in the local Universe), and (2)\nthat models only including GC evaporation strongly underestimate their\nintegrated mass loss over a Hubble time.\n", "  We present the updated version of MadDM, a new dark matter tool based on\nMadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework. New version includes direct detection capability\nin addition to relic abundance computation. In this article, we provide short\ndescription of the implementation of relevant effective operators and\nvalidations against existing results in literature.\n", "  Studying the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model with type IIA string theory, we find\nthe glueball-baryon interaction is predicted in this model. The glueball is\nidentified as the 11D gravitational waves or graviton described by the M5-brane\nsupergravity solution. Employing the relation of M-theory and type IIA string\ntheory, glueball is also 10D gravitational perturbations which are the excited\nmodes by close strings in the bulk of this model. On the other hand, baryon is\nidentified as a D4-brane wrapped on $S^{4}$ which is named as baryon vertex, so\nthe glueball-baryon interaction is nothing but the close string/baryon vertex\ninteraction in this model. Since the baryon vertex could be equivalently\ntreated as the instanton configurations on the flavor brane, we identify the\nglueball-baryon interaction as \"graviton-instanton\" interaction in order to\ndescribe it quantitatively by the quantum mechanical system for the collective\nmodes of baryons. So the effective Hamiltonian can be obtained by considering\nthe gravitational perturbations in the flavor brane action. With this\nHamiltonian, the amplitudes and the selection rules of the glueball-baryon\ninteraction can be analytically calculated in the strong coupling limit. We\nshow our calculations explicitly in two characteristic situations which are\n\"scalar and tensor glueball interacting with baryons\". Although there is a long\nway to go, our work provides a holographic way to understand the interactions\nof baryons in hadronic physics and nuclear physics by the underlying string\ntheory.\n", "  The two-body core+$2n$ cluster structure was implemented to describe the\ntwo-neutron halo nucleus $^{\\mathrm{14}}\\mathrm{Be}$, where the\ncore$^{\\mathrm{12}}\\mathrm{Be}$ was assumed inert and at ground state and the\ndineutron was assumed at pure $2S_0$ state. Based on such a structure the\nthree-body continuum-discretized coupled-channel (CDCC) calculation was\nsuccessfully used to deal with the $^{\\mathrm{14}}\\mathrm{Be}$ breakup\nreactions of $^{\\mathrm{14}}\\mathrm{Be}+^{\\mathrm{12}}\\mathrm{C}$ at\n68~MeV/nucleon and $^{\\mathrm{14}}\\mathrm{Be}+ $Pb at\n35~MeV/nucleon.Consequently, we modeled the kinematically complete measurement\nexperiment of $^{\\mathrm{14}}\\mathrm{Be}$ (35~MeV/nucleon) Coulomb breakup at a\nlead target with the help of Geant4. From the simulation data the relative\nenergy spectrum was constructed by the invariant mass method and $B(E1)$\nspectrum was extracted using virtual photon model. The influence of the target\nthickness and detector performance on the spectroscopy was investigated.\n", "  Precision probes of new physics are often interpreted through their indirect\nsensitivity to short-distance scales. In this proceedings contribution, we\nfocus on the question of which precision observables, at current sensitivity\nlevels, allow for an interpretation via either short-distance new physics or\nconsistent models of long-distance new physics, weakly coupled to the Standard\nModel. The electroweak scale is chosen to set the dividing line between these\nscenarios. In particular, we find that inverse see-saw models of neutrino mass\nallow for light new physics interpretations of most precision leptonic\nobservables, such as lepton universality, lepton flavor violation, but not for\nthe electron EDM.\n", "  The purpose of this study is to determine whether organ sparing and target\ncoverage can be simultaneously maintained for pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton\ntherapy treatment of thoracic tumors in the presence of motion, stopping power\nuncertainties and patient setup variations. Ten consecutive patients that were\npreviously treated with proton therapy to 66.6/1.8 Gy (RBE) using double\nscattering (DS) were replanned with PBS. Minimum and maximum intensity images\nfrom 4DCT were used to introduce flexible smearing in the determination of the\nbeam specific PTV (BSPTV). Datasets from eight 4DCT phases, using +-3%\nuncertainty in stopping power, and +-3 mm uncertainty in patient setup in each\ndirection were used to create 8X12X10=960 PBS plans for the evaluation of ten\npatients. Plans were normalized to provide identical coverage between DS and\nPBS. The average lung V20, V5, and mean doses were reduced from 29.0%, 35.0%,\nand 16.4 Gy with DS to 24.6%, 30.6%, and 14.1 Gy with PBS, respectively. The\naverage heart V30 and V45 were reduced from 10.4% and 7.5% in DS to 8.1% and\n5.4% for PBS, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum spinal cord, esophagus and\nheart dose were decreased from 37.1 Gy, 71.7 Gy and 69.2 Gy with DS to 31.3 Gy,\n67.9 Gy and 64.6 Gy with PBS. The conformity index (CI), homogeneity index\n(HI), and global maximal dose were improved from 3.2, 0.08, 77.4 Gy with DS to\n2.8, 0.04 and 72.1 Gy with PBS. All differences are statistically significant,\nwith p values <0.05, with the exception of the heart V45 (p= 0.146). PBS with\nBSPTV achieves better organ sparing and improves target coverage using a\nrepainting method for the treatment of thoracic tumors. Incorporating\nmotion-related uncertainties is essential in maintaining marginal coverage and\nhomogenous dose of treatment targets.\n", "  Measurements of the radioactive $^{244}$Pu abundances can break the\ndegeneracy between high-rate/low-yield and low-rate/high-yield scenarios for\nthe production of heavy $r$-process elements. The first corresponds to\nproduction by core collapse supernovae (cc-SNe) while the latter corresponds to\nproduction by e.g. compact binary mergers. The estimated $^{244}$Pu abundance\nin the current interstellar medium inferred from deep-sea measurements (Wallner\net al. 2015) is significantly lower than that corresponding Early Solar System\nabundances (Turner et al 2007). We estimate the expected median value of the\n$^{244}$Pu abundances and fluctuations around this value in both models. We\nshow that while the current and Early Solar System abundances are naturally\nexplained within the low-rate/high-yield (e.g. merger) scenario, they are\nincompatible with the high-rate/low-yield (cc-SNe) model. The inferred event\nrate remarkably agrees with compact binary merger rates estimated from Galactic\nneutron star binaries and from short gamma-ray bursts. Furthermore, the ejected\nmass of $r$-process elements per event agrees with both theoretical and\nobservational macronova/kilonova estimates.\n", "  Clustered Low Rank (CLR) framework for block-sparse and block-low-rank tensor\nrepresentation and computation is described. The CLR framework depends on 2\nparameters that control precision: one controlling the CLR block rank\ntruncation and another that controls screening of small contributions in\narithmetic operations on CLR tensors. As these parameters approach zero CLR\nrepresentation and arithmetic become exact. There are no other ad-hoc\nheuristics, such as domains. Use of the CLR format for the order-2 and order-3\ntensors that appear in the context of density fitting (DF) evaluation of the\nHartree-Fock (exact) exchange significantly reduced the storage and\ncomputational complexities below their standard $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ figures. Even for relatively small systems and realistic\nbasis sets CLR-based DF HF becomes more efficient than the standard DF\napproach, and significantly more efficient than the conventional non-DF HF,\nwhile negligibly affecting molecular energies and properties.\n", "  We consider searches for dark matter annihilation in the Sun resulting in\nmonoenergetic neutrinos, produced either directly or through the decay of\nstopped pions and kaons. We find that this strategy is very successful at\nincreasing the signal-to-background ratio, but that current experiments may be\nsignal limited. We discuss the exposures need to fully exploit this search\nstrategy.\n", "  Either in bulk form, or when exfoliated into atomically thin crystals,\nlayered transition metal dichalcogenides are continuously leading to the\ndiscovery of new phenomena. The latest example is provided by 1T'-WTe$_2$, a\nsemimetal recently found to exhibit the largest known magnetoresistance in bulk\ncrystals, and predicted to become a two-dimensional topological insulator in\nstrained monolayers. Here, we show that reducing the thickness through facile\nexfoliation provides an effective experimental knob to tune the electronic\nproperties of WTe$_2$, which allows us to identify the microscopic mechanisms\nresponsible for the observed classical and quantum magnetotransport down to the\nultimate atomic scale. We find that the longitudinal resistance and the very\nunconventional B-dependence of the Hall resistance are reproduced\nquantitatively in terms of a classical two-band model for crystals as thin as\nsix monolayers, and that for thinner crystals a crossover to an insulating,\nAnderson-localized state occurs. Besides establishing the origin of the very\nlarge magnetoresistance of bulk WTe$_2$, our results represent the first,\ncomplete validation of the classical theory for two-band electron-hole\ntransport, and indicate that atomically thin WTe$_2$ layers remain gapless\nsemimetals, from which we conclude that searching for a topological insulating\nstate by straining monolayers is a challenging, but feasible experiment.\n", "  We give a review on the SIMP paradigm and discuss a consistent model for SIMP\ndark mesons in the context of a dark QCD with flavor symmetry. The $Z'$-portal\ninteraction is introduced being compatible with stable dark mesons and is\nresponsible for making the SIMP dark mesons remain in kinetic equilibrium with\nthe SM during the freeze-out process. The SIMP parameter space of the $Z'$\ngauge boson can be probed by future collider and direct detection experiments.\n", "  When did the universe thermalize? In this talk I review the status of this\nissue and its importance in establishing the expected properties of dark\nmatter, the growth of large-scale structure, and the viability of inflation\nmodels when confronted with CMB observations. I also present a novel approach\nto tackling the theoretical challenges surrounding inflationary (p)reheating,\nwhich seeks to extend past work on the Effective Field Theory of Inflation to\nthe time of reheating.\n", "  Spectroscopy of hydrogen can be used for a search into physics beyond the\nStandard Model. Differences between the absorption spectra of H$_2$ as observed\nat high redshift and those measured in the laboratory can be interpreted in\nterms of possible variations of the proton-electron mass ratio. Investigation\nof some ten of such absorbers in the redshift range $z= 2.0-4.2$ yields a\nconstraint of $|\\Delta\\mu/\\mu|< 5 \\times 10^{-6}$ at 3$\\sigma$. Observation of\nH$_2$ from the photospheres of white dwarf stars inside our Galaxy delivers a\nconstraint of similar magnitude on a dependence of $\\mu$ on a gravitational\npotential $10^4$ times as strong as on the Earth's surface. Laser-based\nprecision measurements of dissociation energies, vibrational splittings and\nrotational level energies in H$_2$ molecules and their deuterated isotopomers\nHD and D$_2$ produce values for the rovibrational binding energies fully\nconsistent with quantum ab initio calculations including relativistic and\nquantum electrodynamical (QED) effects. Similarly, precision measurements of\nhigh-overtone vibrational transitions of HD$^+$ ions, captured in ion traps and\nsympathetically cooled to mK temperatures, also result in transition\nfrequencies fully consistent with calculations including QED corrections.\nPrecision measurements of inter-Rydberg transitions in H$_2$ can be\nextrapolated to yield accurate values for level splittings in the H$_2^+$-ion.\nThese comprehensive results of laboratory precision measurements on neutral and\nionic hydrogen molecules can be interpreted to set bounds on the existence of\npossible fifth forces and of higher dimensions, phenomena describing physics\nbeyond the Standard Model.\n", "  A new modified model of nonlinear arcsin-electrodynamics with two parameters\nis proposed and analyzed. We obtain the corrections to the Coulomb law. The\neffect of vacuum birefringence takes place when the external constant magnetic\nfield is present. We calculate indices of refraction for two perpendicular\npolarizations of electromagnetic waves and estimate bounds on the parameter\n$\\gamma$ from the BMV and PVLAS experiments. It is shown that the electric\nfield of a point-like charge is finite at the origin. We calculate the finite\nstatic electric energy of point-like particles and demonstrate that the\nelectron mass can have the pure electromagnetic nature. The symmetrical\nBelinfante energy-momentum tensor and dilatation current are found. We show\nthat the dilatation symmetry and dual symmetry are broken in the model\nsuggested. We have investigated the gauge covariant quantization of the\nnonlinear electrodynamics fields as well as the gauge fixing approach based on\nDirac's brackets.\n", "  Wayne is an algorithm that simulates Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field\nCamera 3 (WFC3) grism spectroscopic frames including sources of noise and\nsystematics. It can simulate both staring and spatial scan modes, and\nobservations such as the transit and the eclipse of an exoplanet. Unlike many\nother instrument simulators, the focus of Wayne is on creating frames with\nrealistic systematics in order to test the effectiveness of different data\nanalysis methods in a variety of different scenarios. This approach is critical\nfor method validation and optimising observing strategies. In this paper we\ndescribe the implementation of Wayne for WFC3 in the near-infrared channel with\nthe G102 and G141 grisms. We compare the simulations to real data, obtained for\nthe exoplanet HD 209458 b to verify the accuracy of the simulation. The\nsoftware is now available as open source at\nhttps://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/wayne.\n", "  A unified theory of quantum critical points beyond the conventional\nLandau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm remains unknown. According to Landau cubic\ncriterion, phase transitions should be first-order when cubic terms of order\nparameters are allowed by symmetry in the Landau-Ginzburg free energy. Here,\nfrom renormalization group (RG) analysis we show that second-order quantum\nphase transitions can occur at such putatively first-order transitions in\ninteracting two-dimensional Dirac semimetals. As such type of Landau-forbidden\nquantum critical points are induced by gapless fermions, we call them\nfermion-induced quantum critical points (FIQCP). We further introduce a\nmicroscopic model of SU(N) fermions on the honeycomb lattice featuring a\ntransition between Dirac semimetals and Kekule valence bond solids. Remarkably,\nour large-scale sign-problem-free Majorana quantum Monte Carlo simulations show\nconvincing evidences of a FIQCP for N=2,3,4,5,6, consistent with the RG\nanalysis. We finally discuss possible experimental realizations of the FIQCP in\ngraphene and graphene-like materials.\n", "  Predictive skill of complex models is often not uniform in model-state space;\nin weather forecasting models, for example, the skill of the model can be\ngreater in populated regions of interest than in \"remote\" regions of the globe.\nGiven a collection of models, a multi-model forecast system using the cross\npollination in time approach can be generalised to take advantage of instances\nwhere some models produce systematically more accurate forecast of some\ncomponents of the model-state. This generalisation is stated and then\nsuccessfully demonstrated in a moderate ~40 dimensional nonlinear dynamical\nsystem suggested by Lorenz. In this demonstration four imperfect models, each\nwith similar global forecast skill, are used. Future applications in weather\nforecasting and in economic forecasting are discussed. The demonstration\nestablishes that cross pollinating forecast trajectories to enrich the\ncollection of simulations upon which the forecast is built can yield a new\nforecast system with significantly more skills than the original multi-model\nforecast system.\n", "  Micro-Raman spectroscopy was employed to study the near-surface stress\ndistributions and origins in Si around through silicon vias (TSVs) at both room\ntemperature and elevated temperatures for Cu-filled and CNT-filled TSV samples.\nFrom the observations, we proved that the stresses near TSVs are mainly from\ntwo sources: 1) pre-existing stress before via filling, and 2) coefficients of\nthermal expansion (CTE) mismatch-induced stress. CTE-mismatch-induced stress is\nshown to dominate the compressive regime of the near-surface stress\ndistribution around Cu-filled TSV structures, while pre-existing stress\ndominates the full range of the stress distribution in the CNT-filled TSV\nstructures. Once the pre-existing stress is minimized, the total stress around\nCNT-filled TSVs can be minimized accordingly. Therefore, compared to Cu-filled\nTSVs, CNT-filled TSVs hold the potential to circumvent the hassle of\nstress-aware circuit layout and to solve the stress-related reliability issues.\n", "  In this work, we present another example of the Lagrangian 1-form structure\nfor the hy- perbolic Calogero-Moser system both in discrete-time level and\ncontinuous-time level. The discrete-time hyperbolic Calogero-Moser system is\nobtained by considering pole-reduction of the semi-discrete\nKadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation. The key relation called the discrete-time\nclosure relation is directly obtained from the compatibility between the\ntemporal Lax matrices. The continuous-time hierarchy of the hyperbolic\nCalogero-Moser system is obtained through two successive continuum limits. The\ncontinuous-time closure relation, which is a consequence of continuum limits on\nthe discrete-time one, is also shown to hold.\n", "  Equilibrium is characterized by its fundamental properties such as the\ndetailed balance, the fluctuation-dissipation relation, and no heat\ndissipation. Based on the stochastic thermodynamics, we show that these three\nproperties are equivalent to each other in conventional Langevin thermal\nsystems with microscopic reversibility. Thus, a conventional steady state has\neither all three properties (equilibrium) or none of them (nonequilibrium). In\ncontrast, with velocity-dependent forces breaking the microscopic\nreversibility, we prove that the detailed balance and the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation mutually exclude each other and no equivalence\nrelation is possible between any two of the three properties. This implies that\na steady state of Langevin systems with velocity-dependent forces may maintain\nsome equilibrium properties but not all of them. Our results are illustrated\nwith a few example systems.\n", "  The two degenerate ground states of the anisotropic Heisenberg (XY) spin\nmodel of a chain of qubits (pseudo-spins) can encode quantum information, but\ntheir degree of protection against local perturbations is known to be only\npartial. We examine the properties of the system in the presence of non-local\nspin-spin interactions, possibly emerging from the quantum electrodynamics of\nthe device. We find a phase distinct from the XY phase admitting two ground\nstates which are highly protected against all local field perturbations,\npersisting across a range of parameters. In the context of the XY chain we\ndiscuss how the coupling between two ground states can be used to observe\nsignatures of topological edge states in a small controlled chain of\nsuperconducting transmon qubits.\n", "  We consider a spherically symmetric stellar model in general relativity whose\ninterior consists of a pressureless fluid undergoing microscopic velocity\ndiffusion in a cosmological scalar field. We show that the diffusion dynamics\ncompel the interior to be spatially homogeneous, by which one can infer\nimmediately that within our model, and in contrast to the diffusion-free case,\nno naked singularities can form in the gravitational collapse. We then study\nthe problem of matching an exterior Bondi type metric to the surface of the\nstar and find that the exterior can be chosen to be a modified Vaidya metric\nwith variable cosmological constant. Finally, we study in detail the causal\nstructure of an explicit, self-similar solution.\n", "  Computer simulation of observable phenomena is an indispensable tool for\nengineering new technology, understanding the natural world, and studying human\nsociety. Yet the most interesting systems are often complex, such that\nsimulating their future behaviour demands storing immense amounts of\ninformation regarding how they have behaved in the past. For increasingly\ncomplex systems, simulation becomes increasingly difficult and is ultimately\nconstrained by resources such as computer memory. Recent theoretical work shows\nquantum theory can reduce this memory requirement beyond ultimate classical\nlimits (as measured by a process' statistical complexity, C). Here we\nexperimentally demonstrate this quantum advantage in simulating stochastic\nprocesses. Our quantum implementation observes a memory requirement of C_q =\n0.05 $\\pm$ 0.01, far below the ultimate classical limit of C = 1. Scaling up\nthis technique would substantially reduce the memory required in simulation of\nmore complex systems.\n", "  A wave packet undergoes a strong spatial and temporal dispersion while\npropagating through a complex medium. This wave scattering is often seen as a\nnightmare in wave physics whether it be for focusing, imaging or communication\npurposes. Controlling wave propagation through complex systems is thus of\nfundamental interest in many areas, ranging from optics or acoustics to medical\nimaging or telecommunications. Here, we study the propagation of elastic waves\nin a cavity and a disordered waveguide by means of laser interferometry. From\nthe direct experimental access to the time-delay matrix of these systems, we\ndemonstrate the existence of particle-like wave packets that remain focused in\ntime and space throughout their complex trajectory. Due to their limited\ndispersion, their selective excitation will be crucially relevant for all\napplications involving selective wave focusing and efficient information\ntransfer through complex media.\n", "  We consider matrix-valued stochastic processes known as isotropic Brownian\nmotions, and show that these can be solved exactly over complex fields. While\nthese processes appear in a variety of questions in mathematical physics, our\nmain motivation is their relation to a May-Wigner-like stability analysis, for\nwhich we obtain a stability phase diagram. The exact results establish the full\njoint probability distribution of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents, and may\nbe used as a starting point for a more detailed analysis of the\nstability-instability phase transition. Our derivations rest on an explicit\nformulation of a Fokker-Planck equation for the Lyapunov exponents. This\nformulation happens to coincide with an exactly solvable class of models of the\nCalgero-Sutherland type, originally encountered for a model of phase-coherent\ntransport. The exact solution over complex fields describes a determinantal\npoint process of biorthogonal type similar to recent results for products of\nrandom matrices, and is also closely related to Hermitian matrix models with an\nexternal source.\n", "  We present a high quality two-dimensional cavity structure based on ZnO\nnanowires coated with concentrical Bragg reflectors. The spatial mode\ndistribution leads to the simultaneous appearance of the weak and strong\ncoupling regime even at room temperature. Photoluminescence measurements agree\nwith FDTD simulations. Furthermore the ZnO core nanowires allow for the\nobservation of middle polariton branches between the A- and B-exciton ground\nstate resonances. Further, lasing emission up to room temperature is detected\nin excitation dependent photoluminescence measurements.\n", "  We develop a new version of the superfield Hamiltonian quantization. The main\nnew feature is that the BRST-BFV charge and the gauge fixing Fermion are\nintroduced on equal footing within the sigma model approach, which provides for\nthe actual use of the quantum/derived antibrackets. We study in detail the\ngenerating equations for the quantum antibrackets and their primed\ncounterparts. We discuss the finite quantum anticanonical transformations\ngenerated by the quantum antibracket.\n", "  We review various superspace approaches to the description of the low-energy\neffective action in N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. We consider the\nfour-derivative part of the low-energy effective action in the Coulomb branch.\nThe typical components of this effective action are the gauge field F^4/X^4 and\nthe scalar field Wess-Zumino terms. We construct N=4 supersymmetric completions\nof these terms in the framework of different harmonic superspaces supporting\nN=2,3,4 supersymmetries. These approaches are complementary to each other in\nthe sense that they make manifest different subgroups of the total SU(4)\nR-symmetry group. We show that the effective action acquires an extremely\nsimple form in those superspaces which manifest the non-anomalous maximal\nsubgroups of SU(4). The common characteristic feature of our construction is\nthat we restore the superfield effective actions exclusively by employing the\nN=4 supersymmetry and/or superconformal PSU(2,2|4) symmetry.\n", "  We discuss nanophotonic structures composed of high-index dielectric\nnanoparticles and present several basic approaches for numerical study of their\ncollective optical response. We also provide comparison on the collective\noptical properties of dielectric and plasmonic structures, and review\nexperimental demonstrations of Fano resonances in all-dielectric nanoparticle\noligomers.\n", "  Microlensing is generally thought to probe planetary systems only out to a\nfew Einstein radii. Microlensing events generated by bound planets beyond about\n10 Einstein radii generally do not yield any trace of their hosts, and so would\nbe classified as free floating planets (FFPs). I show that it is already\npossible, using adaptive optics (AO), to constrain the presence of potential\nhosts to FFP candidates at separations comparable to the Oort Cloud. With\nnext-generation telescopes, planets at Kuiper-Belt separations can be probed.\nNext generation telescopes will also permit routine vetting for all FFP\ncandidates, simply by obtaining second epochs 4-8 years after the event. At\npresent, the search for such hosts is restricted to within the \"confusion\nlimit\" of theta_confus ~ 250 mas, but future WFIRST observations will allow one\nto probe beyond this confusion limit as well.\n", "  The phenomenon of inverse magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry in QCD\npredicted by lattice simulations can be reproduced within the\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model if the coupling~$G$ of the model decreases with the\nstrength $B$ of the magnetic field and temperature~$T$. The thermo-magnetic\ndependence of $G(B,T)$ is obtained by fitting recent lattice QCD predictions\nfor the chiral transition order parameter. Different thermodynamic quantities\nof magnetized quark matter evaluated with $G(B, T)$ are compared with the ones\nobtained at constant coupling, $G$. The model with $G(B,T)$ predicts a more\ndramatic chiral transition as the field intensity increases. In addition, the\npressure and magnetization always increase with $B$ for a given temperature.\nBeing parametrized by four magnetic field dependent coefficients and having a\nrather simple exponential thermal dependence our accurate ansatz for the\ncoupling constant can be easily implemented to improve typical model\napplications to magnetized quark matter.\n", "  We prove that the eigenvectors associated to small enough eigenvalues of an\nheavy-tailed symmetric random matrix are delocalized with probability tending\nto one as the size of the matrix grows to infinity. The delocalization is\nmeasured thanks to a simple criterion related to the inverse participation\nratio which computes an average ratio of L4 and L2-norms of vectors. In\ncontrast, as a consequence of a previous result, for random matrices with\nsufficiently heavy tails, the eigenvectors associated to large enough\neigenvalues are localized according to the same criterion. The proof is based\non a new analysis of the fixed point equation satisfied asymptotically by the\nlaw of a diagonal entry of the resolvent of this matrix.\n", "  We introduce a new feature of no-signaling (Bell) non-local theories, namely,\nwhen a system of multiple parties manifests genuine non-local correlation, then\nthere cannot be arbitrarily high non-local correlation among any subset of the\nparties. We call this feature, \\textit{complementarity of genuine multipartite\nnon-locality}. We use Svetlichny's criterion for genuine multipartite\nnon-locality and non-local games to derive the complementarity relations under\nno-signaling constraints. We find that the complementarity relations are\ntightened for the much stricter quantum constraints. We compare this notion\nwith the well-known notion of \\textit{monogamy of non-locality}. As a\nconsequence, we obtain tighter non-trivial monogamy relations that take into\naccount genuine multipartite non-locality. Furthermore, we provide numerical\nevidence showcasing this feature using a bipartite measure and several other\nwell-known tripartite measures of non-locality.\n", "  In this work we study constraints from new searches for heavy particles at\nthe LHC on the allowed masses and couplings of a KK Graviton in a holographic\ncomposite Higgs model. Keeping new electroweak states heavy such that\nelectroweak precision tests are satisfied, we control the mass of the lightest\nKK graviton using a brane kinetic term. With this we study KK graviton masses\nfrom 0.5-3 TeV. In our analysis we also employ Little Randall-Sundrum (RS)\nModels, characterised by a lower UV scale in the 5D model which in turn implies\nmodified couplings to massless bulk fields. Viewing this scenario as a strongly\ncoupled 4D theory with a composite Higgs boson, the KK graviton is interpreted\nas a composite spin-2 state and the varying UV scale corresponds to a varying\nintermediate scale between the cutoff of the low energy effective theory and\nthe Planck scale. We find that KK gravitons with masses in the range 0.5-3 TeV\nare compatible with current collider constraints, where the most promising\nchannels for detecting these states are the di-photon and ZZ channels. A\ndetection is more likely in the little RS models, in which the dual gauge\ntheory has a larger number of colours than in traditional RS models.\n", "  We analyze a U(2)-matrix model derived from a finite spectral triple. By\napplying the BV formalism, we find a general solution to the classical master\nequation. To describe the BV formalism in the context of noncommutative\ngeometry, we define two finite spectral triples: the BV spectral triple and the\nBV auxiliary spectral triple. These are constructed from the gauge fields,\nghost fields and anti-fields that enter the BV construction. We show that their\nfermionic actions add up precisely to the BV action. This approach allows for a\ngeometric description of the ghost fields and their properties in terms of the\nBV spectral triple.\n", "  Visible Cherenkov radiation can offers a method of the measurement of the\nvelocity of a charged particles. The angular width of the radiation is\nimportant since it determines the resolution of the velocity measurement. In\nthis article, the angular width of Cherenkov radiation with inclusion of\nmultiple scattering is calculated through the path-integral method, and and the\nanalytical expressions are presented. The condition that multiple scattering\nprocess dominates the angular distribution is obtained.\n", "  The electronic structures and thermoelectric properties of semiconducting\ntransition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers $\\mathrm{MX_2}$ (M=Zr, Hf, Mo, W and\nPt; X=S, Se and Te) are investigated by combining first-principles and\nBoltzmann transport theory, including spin-orbital coupling (SOC). It is found\nthat the gap decrease increases from S to Te in each cation group, when the SOC\nis opened. The spin-orbital splitting has the same trend with gap reducing.\nCalculated results show that SOC has noteworthy detrimental effect on p-type\npower factor, while has a negligible influence in n-type doping except W cation\ngroup, which can be understood by considering the effects of SOC on the valence\nand conduction bands. For $\\mathrm{WX_2}$ (X=S, Se and Te), the SOC leads to\nobservably enhanced power factor in n-type doping, which can be explained by\nSOC-induced band degeneracy, namely bands converge. Among all cation groups, Pt\ncation group shows the highest Seebeck coefficient, which leads to best power\nfactor, if we assume scattering time is fixed. Calculated results show that\n$\\mathrm{MS_2}$ (M=Zr, Hf, Mo, W and Pt) have best p-type power factor for all\ncation groups, and that $\\mathrm{MSe_2}$ (M=Zr and Hf), $\\mathrm{WS_2}$ and\n$\\mathrm{MTe_2}$ (M=Mo and Pt) have more wonderful n-type power factor in\nrespective cation group. Therefore, these results may be useful for further\ntheoretical prediction or experimental search of excellent thermoelectric\nmaterials from semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers.\n", "  Solar photospheric abundances of refractory elements mirror the Earth's to\nwithin ~10 mol% when normalized to the dominant terrestrial planet-forming\nelements Mg, Si and Fe. This allows for the adoption of Solar composition as an\norder-of-magnitude proxy for Earth's. It is not known, however, the degree to\nwhich this mirroring of stellar and terrestrial planet abundances holds true\nfor other star-planet systems without determination of the composition of\ninitial planetesimals via condensation sequence calculations and post\ncondensation processes. We present the open-source Arbitrary Composition\nCondensation Sequence calculator (ArCCoS) to assess how the elemental\ncomposition of a parent star affects that of the planet-building material,\nincluding the extent of oxidation within the planetesimals. We demonstrate the\nutility of ArCCoS by showing how variations in the abundance of the stellar\nrefractory elements Mg and Si affect the condensation of oxygen, a controlling\nfactor in the relative proportions of planetary core and silicate mantle\nmaterial. This, thereby, removes significant degeneracy in the interpretation\nof the structures of exoplanets as well as providing observational tests for\nthe validity of this model.\n", "  Classical strings coupled to a metric, a dilaton and an axion, as conceived\nby superstring theory, suffer from ultraviolet divergences due to\nself-interactions. Consequently, as in the case of radiating charged particles,\nthe corresponding effective string dynamics can not be derived from an action\nprinciple. We propose a fundamental principle to build this dynamics, based on\nlocal energy-momentum conservation in terms of a well-defined\ndistribution-valued energy-momentum tensor. Its continuity equation implies a\nfinite equation of motion for self-interacting strings. The construction is\ncarried out explicitly for strings in uniform motion in arbitrary space-time\ndimensions, where we establish cancelations of ultraviolet divergences which\nparallel superstring non-renormalization theorems. The uniqueness properties of\nthe resulting dynamics are analyzed.\n", "  Compared to experiment, the calculated bulk lattice constant of FeSe is too\nsmall in LDA, PBEsol and PBE type exchange-correlation (xc) functionals even\nthough the mismatch decreases from LDA to PBE. In bulk SrTiO3 (STO) on the\nother hand LDA over-binds, PBE under-binds and PBEsol agrees best with\nexperiment. With the errors in opposite directions, the strain in the FeSe\nmonolayer on STO depends on the xc functional and, especially in the\nnon-magnetic state, is strongly overestimated. In this work we investigate the\ninfluence of the xc functional and magnetism in density functional calculations\non electronic bonding properties and charge transfer in the FeSe monolayer on a\nSTO substrate. Furthermore, we consider the effect of oxygen-vacancies within\nthe virtual crystal approximation. In agreement with earlier work, we find that\nthe band structure of the checkerboard antiferromagnetic configuration agrees\nbest with experiment where, in addition, the relative strain on FeSe is best\ndescribed. For a small vacancy concentration, in agreement with recent\nexperiment, the FeSe monolayer Ti layer distance increases while for higher\nconcentrations it decreases.\n", "  We present a detailed study on magnetic, thermodynamic and transport\nproperties of polycrystalline RAgAl3(R = Ce and Pr) compounds. Both compounds\ncrystallize in orthorhombic structure, which is distorted from the tetragonal\nBaAl4 structure with the space group Cmcm. Heat capacity measurement indicates\nthe bulk magnetic ordering of the compounds. CeAgAl3 and PrAgAl3 order\nferromagnetically at TC = 3.8 K and 5.8 K, respectively as it was confirmed\nfrom magnetic measurements. CeAgAl3 exhibits heavy Fermion behaviour. The\nSchottky behaviour in heat capacity data was observed in both compounds. The\ncrystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the magnetic parts of heat\ncapacity of CeAgAl3 and PrAgAl3 yielded to a CEF level scheme with three\ndoublets and nine singlets and with an overall splitting of 51 K and 180 K,\nrespectively. Fit yielded a magnetic doublet state for CeAgAl3, whereas for\nPrAgAl3 a pseudo-doublet ground-state with an energy difference of 15 K has\nbeen obtained. The resistivity measurements display a low temperature drop at\nthe magnetic ordering temperature of the compounds. Negative magnetoresistance\n(MR) due to the ferromagnetic ordering has been observed for both Ce and Pr\ncompounds.\n", "  We have studied properties of quantum charge fluids interacting with random\nimpurities or heavy polarons using a microscopic Hamiltonian with the full\nmany-body Coulomb interaction with the use of variational many-body formalism.\nAt zero temperature and high enough density the bosonic fluid is\nsuperconducting, but when density decreases the Coulomb interaction will be\nstrongly over-screened and impurities or polarons begin to trap charge carriers\nforming bound quasiparticle like clusters, which we call Coulomb bubbles or\nclumps. These bubbles are embedded inside the superconductor and form nuclei of\na new insulating state- the local Charge Density Wave(CDW). The growth of a\nbubble is terminated by the Coulomb force. The fluid contains two groups of\ncharge carriers associated with free and localized states. The insulating state\narises via a percolation of the insulating islands of bubbles, which cluster\nand prevent the flow of the electrical supercurrent through the system.\n  The picture is consistent with the Gorkov and Teitelbaum (GT) analysis of the\ntransport, Hall effect data and the ARPES spectra as well as with nanoscale\nsuperstructures observed in Scanning Tunneling Microscope(STM) experiments. The\nscenario of the clump formation may be also applicable to pnictides, where two\ntypes of clumps may arise even at very high temperatures. The paper has been\npublished in the book \"Condensed Matter Theories\" volume 24.\n", "  Students' difficulties in quantum mechanics may be the result of unproductive\nframing and not a fundamental inability to solve the problems or misconceptions\nabout physics content. We observed groups of students solving quantum mechanics\nproblems in an upper-division physics course. Using the lens of epistemological\nframing, we investigated four frames in our observational data: algorithmic\nmath, conceptual math, algorithmic physics, and conceptual physics. We discuss\nthe characteristics of each frame as well as causes for transitions between\ndifferent frames, arguing that productive problem solving may occur in any\nframe as long as students' transition appropriately between frames. Our work\nextends epistemological framing theory on how students frame discussions in\nupper-division physics courses.\n", "  The long-range magnetic field is the most time-consuming part in\nmicromagnetic simulations. Improvements both on a numerical and computational\nbasis can relief problems related to this bottleneck. This work presents an\nefficient implementation of the Fast Multipole Method [FMM] for the magnetic\nscalar potential as used in micromagnetics. We assume linearly magnetized\ntetrahedral sources, treat the near field directly and use analytical\nintegration on the multipole expansion in the far field. This approach tackles\nimportant issues like the vectorial and continuous nature of the magnetic\nfield. By using FMM the calculations scale linearly in time and memory.\n", "  We study the large deviations of the magnetization at some finite time in the\nCurie-Weiss Random Field Ising Model with parallel updating. While relaxation\ndynamics in an infinite time horizon gives rise to unique dynamical\ntrajectories (specified by initial conditions and governed by first-order\ndynamics of the form $m_{t+1}=f(m_t)$), we observe that the introduction of a\nfinite time horizon and the specification of terminal conditions can generate a\nhost of metastable solutions obeying \\textit{second-order} dynamics. We show\nthat these solutions are governed by a Newtonian-like dynamics in discrete time\nwhich permits solutions in terms of both the first order relaxation (\"forward\")\ndynamics and the backward dynamics $m_{t+1} = f^{-1}(m_t)$. Our approach allows\nus to classify trajectories for a given final magnetization as stable or\nmetastable according to the value of the rate function associated with them. We\nfind that in analogy to the Freidlin-Wentzell description of the stochastic\ndynamics of escape from metastable states, the dominant trajectories may switch\nbetween the two types (forward and backward) of first-order dynamics.\n", "  A numerical scheme to compute the spectrum of a large class of self-adjoint\nextensions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on manifolds with boundary in any\ndimension is presented. The algorithm is based on the characterisation of a\nlarge class of self-adjoint extensions of Laplace-Beltrami operators in terms\nof their associated quadratic forms. The convergence of the scheme is proved. A\ntwo-dimensional version of the algorithm is implemented effectively and several\nnumerical examples are computed showing that the algorithm treats in a unified\nway a wide variety of boundary conditions.\n", "  We study a conjectured correspondence between any codimension two convex\nsurface and a quantum state (SS-duality for short). By generalizing thermofield\ndouble formalism to continuum version of the multi-scale entanglement\nrenormalization ansatz (cMERA) and using the SS-duality, we show that thermal\ngeometries naturally emerge as a result of hidden quantum entanglement between\nboundary CFTs. We therefore propose a general framework to emerge the thermal\ngeometry from CFT at finite temperature. As an example, the case of $2d$ CFT is\nconsidered. We calculate its information metric and show that it is either BTZ\nblack hole or thermal AdS as expected.\n", "  Non-perturbative quantum-gravity effects can change the fate of black holes\nand make them bounce in a time scale shorter than the Hawking evaporation time.\nIn this article, we show that this hypothesis can account for the GeV excess\nobserved from the galactic center by the Fermi satellite. By carefully taking\ninto account the secondary component due to the decay of unstable hadrons, we\nshow that the model is fully self-consistent. This phenomenon presents a\nspecific redshift-dependance that could allow to distinguish it from other\nastrophysical phenomena possibly contributing to the GeV excess.\n", "  The Sausage radio relic is the arc-like radio structure in the cluster CIZA\nJ2242.8+5301, whose observed properties can be best understood by synchrotron\nemission from relativistic electrons accelerated at a merger-driven shock.\nHowever, there remain a few puzzles that cannot be explained by the shock\nacceleration model with only in-situ injection. In particular, the Mach number\ninferred from the observed radio spectral index, $M_{\\rm radio}\\approx 4.6$,\nwhile the Mach number estimated from X-ray observations, $M_{\\rm X-ray}\\approx\n2.7$. In an attempt to resolve such a discrepancy, here we consider the\nre-acceleration model in which a shock of $M_s\\approx 3$ sweeps through the\nintracluster gas with a pre-existing population of relativistic electrons. We\nfind that observed brightness profiles at multi frequencies provide strong\nconstraints on the spectral shape of pre-existing electrons. The models with a\npower-law momentum spectrum with the slope, $s\\approx 4.1$, and the cutoff\nLorentz factor, $\\gamma_{e,c}\\approx 3-5\\times 10^4$ can reproduce reasonably\nwell the observed spatial profiles of radio fluxes and integrated radio\nspectrum of the Sausage relic. The possible origins of such relativistic\nelectrons in the intracluster medium remain to be investigated further.\n", "  We present results of micromagnetic simulations of thin ferromagnetic nano\nhemispheroidal shells with sizes ranging from 1 to 50 nm (inside dimensions).\nDepending on the geometrical and magnetic parameters of the hemispheroidal\nshell, there exist four different magnetic phases: easy axis, easy plane, onion\nand vortex. The profile for the vortex magnetization distribution is analyzed\nand the limitations and applicability of different vortex ansatzes are\ndiscussed. In addition, we investigate the total energy density for each of the\nmagnetic distributions as a function of the hemispheroidal shell dimensions.\n", "  We describe a combined halo model to constrain the distribution of neutral\nhydrogen (HI) in the post-reionization universe. We combine constraints from\nthe various probes of HI at different redshifts: the low-redshift 21-cm\nemission line surveys, intensity mapping experiments at intermediate redshifts,\nand the Damped Lyman-Alpha (DLA) observations at higher redshifts. We use a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to combine the observations and place\nconstraints on the free parameters in the model. Our best-fit model involves a\nrelation between neutral hydrogen mass $M_{\\rm HI}$ and halo mass $M$ with a\nnon-unit slope, and an upper and a lower cutoff. We find that the model fits\nall the observables but leads to an underprediction of the bias parameter of\nDLAs at $z \\sim 2.3$. We also find indications of a possible tension between\nthe HI column density distribution and the mass function of HI-selected\ngalaxies at $z\\sim 0$. We provide the central values of the parameters of the\nbest-fit model so derived. We also provide a fitting form for the derived\nevolution of the concentration parameter of HI in dark matter haloes, and\ndiscuss the implications for the redshift evolution of the HI-halo mass\nrelation.\n", "  We provide an analytic framework for interpreting observations of multiphase\ncircumgalactic gas that is heavily informed by recent numerical simulations of\nthermal instability and precipitation in cool-core galaxy clusters. We start by\nconsidering the local conditions required for the formation of multiphase gas\nvia two different modes: (1) uplift of ambient gas by galactic outflows, and\n(2) condensation in a stratified stationary medium in which thermal balance is\nexplicitly maintained. Analytic exploration of these two modes provides\ninsights into the relationships between the local ratio of the cooling and\nfreefall time scales (i.e., t_cool / t_ff), the large-scale gradient of\nspecific entropy, and development of precipitation and multiphase media in\ncircumgalactic gas. We then use these analytic findings to interpret recent\nsimulations of circumgalactic gas in which global thermal balance is\nmaintained. We show that long-lasting configurations of gas with 5 < t_cool /\nt_ff < 20 and radial entropy profiles similar to observations of local\ncool-core galaxy cluster cores are a natural outcome of precipitation-regulated\nfeedback. We conclude with some observational predictions that follow from\nthese models. This work focuses primarily on precipitation and AGN feedback in\ngalaxy cluster cores, because that is where the observations of multiphase gas\naround galaxies are most complete. However, many of the physical principles\nthat govern condensation in those environments apply to circumgalactic gas\naround galaxies of all masses.\n", "  We analyse the broad-range shape of the monopole and quadrupole correlation\nfunctions of the BOSS Data Release 12 (DR12) CMASS and LOWZ galaxy sample to\nobtain constraints on the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$, the angular-diameter\ndistance $D_A(z)$, the normalised growth rate $f(z)\\sigma_8(z)$, and the\nphysical matter density $\\Omega_mh^2$. We adopt wide and flat priors on all\nmodel parameters in order to ensure the results are those of a `single-probe'\ngalaxy clustering analysis. We also marginalise over three nuisance terms that\naccount for potential observational systematics affecting the measured\nmonopole. However, such Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis is computationally\nexpensive for advanced theoretical models, thus we develop a new methodology to\nspeed up our analysis. We obtain $\\{D_A(z)r_{s,fid}/r_s$Mpc,\n$H(z)r_s/r_{s,fid}$kms$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, $f(z)\\sigma_8(z)$, $\\Omega_m h^2\\}$ =\n$\\{956\\pm28$ , $75.0\\pm4.0$ , $0.397 \\pm 0.073$, $0.143\\pm0.017\\}$ at $z=0.32$\nand $\\{1421\\pm23$, $96.7\\pm2.7$ , $0.497 \\pm 0.058$, $0.137\\pm0.015\\}$ at\n$z=0.59$ where $r_s$ is the comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch and\n$r_{s,fid}=147.66$Mpc for the fiducial cosmology in this study. In addition, we\ndivide the galaxy sample into four redshift bins to increase the sensitivity of\nredshift evolution. However, we do not find improvements in terms of\nconstraining dark energy model parameters. Combining our measurements with\nPlanck data, we obtain $\\Omega_m=0.306\\pm0.009$,\n$H_0=67.9\\pm0.7$kms$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, and $\\sigma_8=0.815\\pm0.009$ assuming\n$\\Lambda$CDM; $\\Omega_k=0.000\\pm0.003$ assuming oCDM; $w=-1.01\\pm0.06$ assuming\n$w$CDM; and $w_0=-0.95\\pm0.22$ and $w_a=-0.22\\pm0.63$ assuming $w_0w_a$CDM. Our\nresults show no tension with the flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. This\npaper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from\nBOSS.\n", "  We present a theory study of the physisorption of the series of\nmethylbenzenes (toluene, xylene and mesitylene), as well as benzene, on\ngraphene. This is relevant for the basic understanding of graphene used as a\nmaterial for sensors and as an idealized model for the carbon in active carbon\nfilters. The molecules are studied in a number of positions and orientations\nrelative graphene, using density functional theory with the van der Waals\nfunctional vdW-DF. We focus on the vdW-DF1 and vdW-DF-cx functionals, and find\nthat the binding energy of the molecules on graphene grows linearly with the\nnumber of methyl groups, at the rate of 0.09 eV per added methyl group.\n", "  We study the tachyon scalar field model in flat FRW cosmology with the\nparticular potential $\\phi^{-2}$ and the scale factor behavior $a(t)=t^n$. We\nconsider the spherical collapse model and investigate the effects of the\ntachyon scalar field on the structure formation in flat FRW universe. We\ncalculate $\\delta_{c}(z_{c})$, $\\lambda(z_{c})$, $\\xi(z_{c})$,\n$\\Delta_{V}(z_{c})$, $\\log [\\nu f(\\nu)]$ and $\\log [n(k)]$ for the tachyon\nscalar field model and compare the results with the results of EdS model and\n$\\Lambda CDM$ model. It is shown that in the tachyon scalar field model the\nstructure formation may occur earlier, in comparison to the other models.\n", "  We investigate optical properties of amorphous alumina (Al_2O_3) dust grains\nin the envelopes around O-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars considering\nthe laboratory measured optical data. We derive the optical constants of\namorphous alumina in a wide wavelength range that satisfy the Kramers-Kronig\nrelation and reproduce the laboratory measured data. Using the amorphous\nalumina and silicate dust, we compare the radiative transfer model results with\nthe observed spectral energy distributions. Comparing the theoretical models\nwith the observations on various IR two-color diagrams for a large sample\nO-rich AGB stars, we find that the amorphous alumina dust (about 10-40 %) mixed\nwith amorphous silicate can reproduce much more observed points for the O-rich\nAGB stars with thin dust envelopes.\n", "  In this work, we present an analytical solution for QCD$\\otimes$QED coupled\nDokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations at the\nleading order (LO) accuracy in QED and next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in\nperturbative QCD using double Laplace transform. This technique is applied to\nobtain the singlet, gluon and photon distribution functions and also the proton\nstructure function. We also obtain contribution of photon in proton at LO and\nNLO at high energy and successfully compare the proton structure function with\nHERA data \\cite{12} and APFEL results \\cite{7}. Some comparisons also have been\ndone for the singlet and gluon distribution functions with the MSTW\nresults\\cite{9}. In addition, the contribution of photon distribution function\ninside the proton has been compared with results of MRST \\cite{11} and with the\ncontribution of sea quark distribution functions which obtained by MSTW\n\\cite{9} and CTEQ6M \\cite{14}.\n", "  Using linear combinations of Lax matrices of soliton hierarchies, we\nintroduce trigonal curves by their characteristic equations, and determine\nDubrovin type equations for zeros and poles of meromorphic functions defined as\nratios of the Baker-Akhiezer functions. We straighten out all flows in soliton\nhierarchies under the Abel-Jacobi coordinates associated with Lax pairs, and\ngenerate algebro-geometric solutions to soliton hierarchies in terms of the\nRiemann theta functions, through observing asymptotic behaviors of the\nBaker-Akhiezer functions. We analyze the four-component AKNS soliton hierarchy\nin such a way that it leads to a general theory of trigonal curves applicable\nto construction of algebro-geometric solutions of an arbitrary soliton\nhierarchy.\n", "  Many-body localization (MBL) is a phase of matter that is characterized by\nthe absence of thermalization. Dynamical generation of a large number of local\nquantum numbers has been identified as one key characteristic of this phase,\nquite possibly the microscopic mechanism of breakdown of thermalization and the\nphase transition itself. We formulate a robust algorithm, based on Wegner\nWilson flow (WWF) renormalization, for computing these conserved quantities and\ntheir interactions. We present evidence for the existence of distinct fixed\npoint distributions of the latter: a flat \"white noise\" distribution in the\nergodic phase, a \"1/f\" law inside the MBL phase, and scale-free distributions\nin the transition regime.\n", "  The calibration of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data has long\nbeen a time consuming process. The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a simple array\nconsisting of three identical antennas. Because four frequencies are observed\nsimultaneously, phase solutions can be transferred from lower frequencies to\nhigher frequencies in order to improve phase coherence and hence sensitivity at\nhigher frequencies. Due to the homogeneous nature of the array, the KVN is also\nwell suited for automatic calibration. In this paper we describe the automatic\ncalibration of single-polarisation KVN data using the KVN Pipeline and\ncomparing the results against VLBI data that has been manually reduced. We find\nthat the pipelined data using phase transfer produces better results than a\nmanually reduced dataset not using the phase transfer. Additionally we compared\nthe pipeline results with a manually reduced phase-transferred dataset and\nfound the results to be identical.\n", "  I introduce $Profiler$, a new, user-friendly program written in $Python$ and\ndesigned to analyse the radial surface brightness profiles of galaxies. With an\nintuitive graphical user interface, $Profiler$ can accurately model a wide\nrange of galaxies and galaxy components, such as elliptical galaxies, the\nbulges of spiral and lenticular galaxies, nuclear sources, discs, bars, rings,\nspiral arms, etc., with a variety of parametric functions routinely employed in\nthe field (S\\'ersic, core-S\\'ersic, exponential, Gaussian, Moffat and Ferrers).\nIn addition to these, $Profiler$ can employ the broken exponential model\n(relevant for disc truncations or antitruncations) and two special cases of the\nedge-on disc model: namely along the major axis (in the disc plane) and along\nthe minor axis (perpendicular to the disc plane). $Profiler$ is optimised to\nwork with galaxy light profiles obtained from isophotal measurements which\ncapture radial gradients in the ellipticity, position angle and Fourier\nharmonic profiles of the isophotes, and are thus often better at capturing the\ntotal light than two-dimensional image-fitting programs. Additionally, the\none-dimensional approach is generally less computationally expensive and more\nstable. In $Profiler$, the convolution of either circular or elliptical models\nwith the point spread function is performed in two-dimensions, and offers a\nchoice between Gaussian, Moffat or a user-provided data vector (a table of\nintensity values as a function of radius) for the point spread function. I\ndemonstrate $Profiler$'s features and operation by decomposing three case-study\ngalaxies: the cored elliptical galaxy NGC 3348, the nucleated dwarf Seyfert I\ngalaxy Pox 52, and NGC 2549, a structurally complex, double-barred galaxy which\nalso displays a Type II truncated disc viewed edge-on. $Profiler$ is freely\navailable at: https://github.com/BogdanCiambur/PROFILER\n", "  The neutral hydrogen (HI) content of dark matter haloes forms an intermediate\nstate in the baryon cycle that connects the hot shock-heated gas and cold\nstar-forming gas in haloes. Measurement of the relationship between HI mass and\nhalo mass therefore puts important constraints on galaxy formation models. We\ncombine radio observations of HI in emission at low redshift ($z\\sim 0$) with\noptical/UV observations of HI in absorption at high redshift ($1<z<4$) to\nderive constraints on the evolution of the HI-mass halo-mass (HIHM) relation\nfrom redshift $z=4$ to $z=0$. We find that one can model the HIHM relation\nsimilar to the stellar-mass halo-mass (SHM) relation at $z \\sim 0$. At $z=0$,\nhaloes with mass $10^{11.7}$ M$_\\odot$ have the highest HI mass fraction ($\\sim\n1\\%$), which is about four times smaller than their stellar mass fraction. We\nmodel the evolution of the HIHM relation in a manner similar to that of the SHM\nrelation. Combining this parameterisation with a redshift- and mass-dependent\nmodified Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile for the HI density within a halo, we\ndraw constraints on the evolution of the HIHM relation from the observed HI\ncolumn density, incidence rate, and clustering bias at high redshift. We\ncompare these findings with results from hydrodynamical simulations and other\napproaches in the literature, and find the models to be consistent with each\nother at the $68\\%$ confidence level.\n", "  We investigate the generation of entanglement in systems of identical\nfermions through a process involving particle detection, focusing on the\nimplications that this kind of processes have for the concept of entanglement\nbetween fermionic particles. As a paradigmatic example we discuss in detail a\nscheme based on a splitting-plus-detection operation. This scheme generates\nstates with accessible entanglement starting from an initial pure state of two\nindistinguishable fermions exhibiting correlations due purely to\nantisymmetrization. It is argued that the proposed extraction of entanglement\ndoes not contravene the notion that entanglement in identical-fermion systems\nrequires correlations beyond those purely due to their indistinguishability. In\npoint of fact, it is shown that this concept of entanglement, here referred to\nas {\\it fermonic entanglement}, actually helps to clarify some essential\naspects of the entanglement generation process. In particular, we prove that\nthe amount of extracted accessible entanglement equals the amount of fermionic\nentanglement created with the detection process. The aforementioned scheme is\ngeneralized for the case of $N$-identical fermion systems of arbitrary\ndimension. It transpires from our present discussion that a proper analysis of\nentanglement generation during the splitting-plus-detection operation is not\nonly consistent with the concept of fermonic entanglement, but actually\nreinforces this concept.\n", "  Albeit difficult to access experimentally, the density of states (DOS) is a\nkey parameter in solid state systems which governs several important phenomena\nincluding transport, magnetism, thermal, and thermoelectric properties. We\nstudy DOS in an ensemble of potassium intercalated single-wall carbon nanotubes\n(SWCNT) and show using electron spin resonance spectroscopy that a sizeable\nnumber of electron states are present, which gives rise to a Fermi-liquid\nbehavior in this material. A comparison between theoretical and the\nexperimental DOS indicates that it does not display significant correlation\neffects, even though the pristine nanotube material shows a Luttinger-liquid\nbehavior. We argue that the carbon nanotube ensemble essentially maps out the\nwhole Brillouin zone of graphene thus it acts as a model system of biased\ngraphene.\n", "  This paper treats possible solutions for vibration mitigation in\nreduced-order model of partially-filled liquid tank under impulsive forcing.\nSuch excitation may lead to hydraulic impacts applied on the tank inner walls.\nFinite stiffness of the tank walls is taken into account. We explore both\nlinear (Tuned Mass Damper) and nonlinear (Nonlinear Energy Sink) passive\nvibration absorbers; mitigation performances are examined numerically. The\nliquid sloshing mass is modeled by equivalent massspring-dashpot system, which\ncan both perform small-amplitude linear oscillations and impact the vessel\nwalls. We use parameters of the equivalent mass-spring-dashpot system for\nwell-explored case of cylindrical tanks. The hydraulic impacts are modeled by\nhigh-power potential and dissipation functions. Critical location in the tank\nstructure is determined and expression of the corresponding local mechanical\nstress is derived. We use finite-elemet approach to assess the natural\nfrequencies for specific system parameters and to figure out possibilities for\ninternal resonances. Numerical evaluation criteria are suggested to determine\nthe energy absorption performance.\n", "  We derive the codimension-two defects of 4d $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super\nYang-Mills (SYM) theory from the (2, 0) little string. The origin of the little\nstring is type IIB theory compactified on an ADE singularity. The defects are\nD-branes wrapping the 2-cycles of the singularity. We use this construction to\nmake contact with the description of SYM defects due to Gukov and Witten\n[arXiv:hep-th/0612073]. Furthermore, we derive from a geometric perspective the\ncomplete nilpotent orbit classification of codimension-two defects, and the\nconnection to ADE-type Toda CFT. The only data needed to specify the defects is\na set of weights of the algebra obeying certain constraints, which we give\nexplicitly. We highlight the differences between the defect classification in\nthe little string theory and its (2, 0) CFT limit.\n", "  State-of-the-art machine learning techniques promise to become a powerful\ntool in statistical mechanics via their capacity to distinguish different\nphases of matter in an automated way. Here we demonstrate that convolutional\nneural networks (CNN) can be optimized for quantum many-fermion systems such\nthat they correctly identify and locate quantum phase transitions in such\nsystems. Using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to sample\nthe many-fermion system, we show that the Green's function (but not the\nauxiliary field) holds sufficient information to allow for the distinction of\ndifferent fermionic phases via a CNN. We demonstrate that this QMC + machine\nlearning approach works even for systems exhibiting a severe fermion sign\nproblem where conventional approaches to extract information from the Green's\nfunction, e.g.~in the form of equal-time correlation functions, fail. We expect\nthat this capacity of hierarchical machine learning techniques to circumvent\nthe fermion sign problem will drive novel insights into some of the most\nfundamental problems in statistical physics.\n", "  We introduce a new technique for approaching birationality questions that\narise in the mirror symmetry of complete intersections in toric varieties. As\nan application we answer affirmatively and conclusively the question of\nBatyrev-Nill (2008) about the birationality of Calabi-Yau families associated\nto multiple mirror nef-partitions. This completes the progress in this\ndirection made by Li's breakthrough (2016). In the process, we obtain results\nin the theory of Borisov's nef-partitions (1993) and provide new insight on the\ngeometric content of the multiple mirror phenomenon.\n", "  Graphene membrane irradiated by weak activating periodic electric field in\nterahertz range is considered. The corrected formula for the graphene quantum\nconductivity is found. The obtained formula gives complex conjugate results\nwhen radiation polarization direction is clockwise or it is opposite clockwise.\nThe found formula allows us to see that the graphene membrane is an oscillating\ncontour. Its eigen frequency coincides with a singularity point of the\nconductivity and depends on the electrons concentration. So the graphene\nmembrane could be used as an antenna or a transistor and its eigen frequency\ncould be tuned by doping in a large terahertz-infrared frequency range. The\nobtained formula allows us also to calculate the graphene membrane quantum\ninductivity and capacitance. The found dependence on electrons concentration is\nconsistent with experiments. The method of the proof is based on the study of\nthe time-dependent density matrix. The exact solution of the von Neumann\nequation for density matrix is found for our case in linear approximation on\nthe external field. On this basis the induced current is studied and then the\nformula for quantum conductivity as a function of external field frequency and\ntemperature is obtained. The method of the proof suggested in this paper could\nbe used to study other problems. The found formula for quantum conductivity can\nbe used to correct the SPPs Dispersion Relation and for the description of\nradiation process. It would be useful to take the obtained results into account\nwhen constructing devices containing graphene membrane nanoantenna. Such\nproject could make it possible to create wireless communications among\nnanosystems. This would be promising research area of energy harvesting\napplications.\n", "  Nonadiabatic ring-polymer molecular dynamics employs the mapping approach to\ndescribe nonadiabatic effects within the ring-polymer ansatz. In this paper, it\nis generalized to allow for the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom to be\ndescribed by different numbers of ring-polymer beads. Analysis of the resulting\nmethod shows that as the number of electronic mapping variables increases,\ncertain problems associated with the approach are removed, such as the\nnon-unique choice of the mapping Hamiltonian and negative populations leading\nto inverted potential-energy surfaces. Explicit integration over cyclic\nvariables reduces the sign problem for the initial distribution in the general\ncase. A new application for the simulation of vibronic spectra is described and\npromising results are presented for a model system.\n", "  A new family of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) propagating on a regular\n$(1+2)$D spacetime lattice is introduced. The continuous limit of these DTQWs\nis shown to coincide with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion interacting with an\narbitrary relativistic gravitational field. This family is used to model the\ninfluence of arbitrary linear gravitational waves (GWs) on DTQWs. Pure shear\nGWs are studied in detail. On large spatial scales, pure shear GWs do not\nmodify the polarizations of the fermion eigen-modes, but rescale all energies\nby a common factor. On smaller scales typically comparable to two or three\nlattice steps, both polarizations and energies are modified in a non-trivial\nway. This effect is particularly salient on interference patterns between the\nfermion eigen-modes.\n", "  We present a general counting result for the unstable eigenvalues of linear\noperators of the form $JL$ in which $J$ and $L$ are skew- and self-adjoint\noperators, respectively. Assuming that there exists a self-adjoint operator $K$\nsuch that the operators $JL$ and $JK$ commute, we prove that the number of\nunstable eigenvalues of $JL$ is bounded by the number of nonpositive\neigenvalues of~$K$. As an application, we discuss the transverse stability of\none-dimensional periodic traveling waves in the classical KP-II\n(Kadomtsev--Petviashvili) equation. We show that these one-dimensional periodic\nwaves are transversely spectrally stable with respect to general\ntwo-dimensional bounded perturbations, including periodic and localized\nperturbations in either the longitudinal or the transverse direction, and that\nthey are transversely linearly stable with respect to doubly periodic\nperturbations.\n", "  In\n[\\href{http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037596019290711T}{Phys.\nLett. A {\\bf 166}, 293 (1992)}] Popescu characterized nonlocality of pure\n$n$-partite entangled systems by studying bipartite violation of local realism\nwhen $n-2$ number of parties perform projective measurements on their\nparticles. A pertinent question in this scenario is whether similar\ncharacterization is possible for $n$-partite mixed entangled states also. In\nthe present work we have followed an analogous approach so as to explore\nwhether given a tripartite mixed entangled state the conditional bipartite\nstates obtained by performing projective measurement on the third party,\ndemonstrate a weaker form of nonlocality, quantum steering. We also compare\nthis new phenomenon of conditional steering with existing notions of tripartite\ncorrelations. Interestingly the tripartite state need not be genuinely\nentangled to demonstrate conditional steering.\n", "  In weak gravitational lensing, weighted quadrupole moments of the brightness\nprofile in galaxy images are a common way to estimate gravitational shear. We\nemploy general adaptive moments (GLAM) to study causes of shear bias on a\nfundamental level and for a practical definition of an image ellipticity. The\nGLAM ellipticity has useful properties for any chosen weight profile: the\nweighted ellipticity is identical to that of isophotes of elliptical images,\nand in absence of noise and pixellation it is always an unbiased estimator of\nreduced shear. We show that moment-based techniques, adaptive or unweighted,\nare similar to a model-based approach in the sense that they can be seen as\nimperfect fit of an elliptical profile to the image. Due to residuals in the\nfit, moment-based estimates of ellipticities are prone to underfitting bias\nwhen inferred from observed images. The estimation is fundamentally limited\nmainly by pixellation which destroys information on the original, pre-seeing\nimage. We give an optimized estimator for the pre-seeing GLAM ellipticity and\nquantify its bias for noise-free images. To deal with pixel noise, we consider\na Bayesian approach where the posterior of the GLAM ellipticity can be\ninconsistent with the true ellipticity if we do not properly account for our\nignorance about fit residuals. This underfitting bias is S/N-independent but\nchanges with the pre-seeing brightness profile and the correlation or\nheterogeneity of pixel noise over the post-seeing image. Furthermore, when\ninferring a constant ellipticity or, more relevantly, constant shear from a\nsource sample with a distribution of intrinsic properties (sizes, centroid\npositions, intrinsic shapes), an additional, now noise-dependent bias arises\ntowards low S/N if incorrect priors for the intrinsic properties are used. We\ndiscuss the origin of this prior bias.\n", "  Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy measurements of magnetic bubble\ndomains demonstrate that Ar+ irradiation around 100 eV can tune the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in Pt/Co/Pt trilayers. Varying the\nirradiation energy and dose changes the DMI sign and magnitude separately from\nthe magnetic anisotropy, allowing tuning of the DMI while holding the coercive\nfield constant. This simultaneous control emphasizes the different physical\norigins of these effects. To accurately measure the DMI, we propose and apply a\nphysical model for a poorly understood peak in domain wall velocity at zero\nin-plane field. The ability to tune the DMI with the spatial resolution of the\nAr+ irradiation enables new fundamental investigations and technological\napplications of chiral nanomagnetics.\n", "  We study the cosmology with the running dark energy. The parametrization of\ndark energy with the respect to the redshift is derived from the first\nprinciples of quantum mechanics. Energy density of dark energy is obtained from\nthe quantum process of transition from the false vacuum state to the true\nvacuum state. This is the class of the extended interacting $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodels. We consider the energy density of dark energy parametrization\n$\\rho_\\text{de}(t)$, which follows from the Breit-Wigner energy distribution\nfunction which is used to model the quantum unstable systems. The idea that\nproperties of the process of the quantum mechanical decay of unstable states\ncan help to understand the properties of the observed universe was formulated\nby Krauss and Dent and this idea was used in our considerations. In the\ncosmological model with the mentioned parametrization there is an energy\ntransfer between the dark matter and dark energy. In such a evolutional\nscenario the universe is starting from the false vacuum state and going to the\ntrue vacuum state of the present day universe. We find that the intermediate\nregime during the passage from false to true vacuum states takes place. The\nintensity of the analyzed process is measured by a parameter $\\alpha$. For the\nsmall value of $\\alpha$ ($0<\\alpha <0.4$) this intermediate (quantum) regime is\ncharacterized by an oscillatory behavior of the density of dark energy while\nthe for $\\alpha > 0.4$ the density of the dark energy simply jumps down. In\nboth cases (independent from the parameter $\\alpha$) the today value of density\nof dark energy is reached at the value of $0.7$. We estimate the cosmological\nparameters for this model with visible and dark matter. This model becomes in\ngood agreement with the astronomical data and is practically indistinguishable\nfrom $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  Previously, we had proposed an optically-pumped five-level Gain EIT (GEIT)\nsystem, which has a transparency dip superimposed on a gain profile and\nexhibits a negative dispersion suitable for the white-light-cavity\nsignal-recycling (WLC-SR) scheme of the interferometeric gravitational wave\ndetector [Phys. Rev. D. 92, 082002 (2015)]. Using this system as the negative\ndispersion medium (NDM) in the WLC-SR, we get an enhancement in the quantum\nnoise (QN) limited sensitivity-bandwidth product by a factor of ~18. Here, we\nshow how to realize this GEIT system in a realistic platform, using\nnon-degenerate Zeeman sublevels in alkali atoms. Specifically we choose\n$^{87}$Rb atoms, which produce the negative dispersion around 795nm. The\ncurrent LIGO operates at 1064nm but future LIGO may operate at a wavelength\nthat is consistent with this atomic system. We present a theoretical analysis\nfor the susceptibilities of the system. To account for the QN from the GEIT\nsystem, it is necessary to use the master equation (ME) approach. However, due\nto the number of energy levels involved, applying the full ME approach to this\nsystem is very complex. We have also shown earlier, in the reference cited\nabove, that under GEIT condition, the net enhancement in the\nsensitivity-bandwidth product, as predicted by the ME, is close to that\npredicted by applying the Caves model for a phase-insensitive linear amplifier.\nTherefore we here use the Caves model for the QN from the NDM and this\nsimplified numerical model shows that the enhancement of the\nsensitivity-bandwidth product as high as 17 is possible.\n", "  Singlet fission (SF) is a potential pathway for significant enhancement of\nefficiency in organic solar cells (OSC). In this paper, we study singlet\nfission in a pair of polyene molecules in two different stacking arrangements\nemploying exact many-body wave packet dynamics. In the non-interacting model,\nthe SF yield is absent. The individual molecules are treated within Hubbard and\nPariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) models and the interaction between them involves\ntransfer terms, intersite electron repulsions and site-charge--bond-charge\nrepulsion terms. Initial wave packet is constructed from excited singlet state\nof one molecule and ground state of the other. Time development of this wave\npacket under the influence of intermolecular interactions is followed within\nthe Schr\\\"odinger picture by an efficient predictor-corrector scheme. In\nunsubstituted Hubbard and PPP chains, $2{}^1A$ excited singlet state leads to\nsignificant SF yield while the $1{}^1B$ state gives negligible fission yield.\nOn substitution by donor-acceptor groups of moderate strength, the lowest\nexcited state will have sufficient $2{}^1A$ character and hence results in\nsignificant SF yield. Because of rapid internal conversion, the nature of the\nlowest excited singlet will determine the SF contribution to OSC efficiency.\nFurthermore, we find the fission yield depends considerably on the stacking\narrangement of the polyene molecules.\n", "  Multiplexing is a strategy to augment the transmission capacity of a\ncommunication system. It consists of combining multiple signals over the same\ndata channel and it has been very successful in classical communications.\nHowever, the use of enhanced channels has only reached limited practicality in\nquantum communications (QC) as it requires the complex manipulation of quantum\nsystems of higher dimensions. Considerable effort is being made towards QC\nusing high-dimensional quantum systems encoded into the transverse momentum of\nsingle photons but, so far, no approach has been proven to be fully compatible\nwith the existing telecommunication infrastructure. Here, we overcome such a\ntechnological challenge and demonstrate a stable and secure high-dimensional\ndecoy-state quantum key distribution session over a 0.3 km long multicore\noptical fiber. The high-dimensional quantum states are defined in terms of the\nmultiple core modes available for the photon transmission over the fiber, and\nthe decoy-state analysis demonstrates that our technique enables a positive\nsecret key generation rate up to 25 km of fiber propagation. Finally, we show\nhow our results build up towards a high-dimensional quantum network composed of\nfree-space and fiber based links\n", "  In a nonlinear oscillatory system, spectral submanifolds (SSMs) are the\nsmoothest invariant manifolds tangent to linear modal subspaces of an\nequilibrium. Amplitude-frequency plots of the dynamics on SSMs provide the\nclassic backbone curves sought in experimental nonlinear model identification.\nWe develop here a methodology to compute analytically both the shape of SSMs\nand their corresponding backbone curves from a data-assimilating model fitted\nto experimental vibration signals. Using examples of both synthetic and real\nexperimental data, we demonstrate that this approach reproduces backbone curves\nwith high accuracy.\n", "  Quit recently, two sets of new experimental data from the $LHCb$ and the\n$CMS$ collaborations have been published, concerning the production of the\n$Z^0$ vector boson in hadron-hadron collisions with the center-of-mass energy\n$E_{CM}= \\sqrt{s}=13\\;TeV$. On the other hand, in our recent work, we have\nconducted a set of $NLO$ calculations for the production of the electroweak\ngauge vector bosons, utilizing the unintegrated parton distribution functions\n($UPDF$) in the frameworks of $Kimber$-$Martin$-$Ryskin$ ($KMR$) or\n$Martin$-$Ryskin$-$Watt$ ($MRW$) and the $k_t$-factorization formalism,\nconcluding that the results of the $KMR$ scheme are arguably better in\ndescribing the existing experimental data, coming from $D0$, $CDF$, $CMS$ and\n$ATLAS$ collaborations. In the present work, we intend to follow the same $NLO$\nformalism and calculate the rate of the production of the $Z^0$ vector boson,\nutilizing the $UPDF$ of $KMR$ within the dynamics of the recent data. It will\nbe shown that our results are in good agreement with the new measurements of\nthe $LHCb$ and the $CMS$ collaborations.\n", "  The present work is devoted to study the high-energy $QCD$ events, such as\nthe di-jet productions from proton-proton inelastic collisions at the $LHC$ in\nthe forward-center and the forward-forward configurations, using the\n$unintegrated$ parton distribution functions ($UPDF$) in the\n$k_t$-factorization framework. The $UPDF$ of $Kimber$ et. al. ($KMR$) and\n$Martin$ et.al. ($MRW$) are generated in the leading order ($LO$) and\nnext-to-leading order ($NLO$), using the $Harland-Lang$ et al. ($MMHT2014$)\n$PDF$ libraries. While working in the forward-center and the forward-forward\nrapidity sectors, one can probe the parton densities at very low longitudinal\nmomentum fractions ($x$). Therefore, such a computation can provide a valuable\ntest-field for these $UPDF$. We find very good agreement with the corresponding\ndi-jet production data available from $LHC$ experiments. On the other hand, as\nwe have also stated in our previous works, (i.e. the protons longitudinal and\ntransverse structure function as well as hadron-hadron $LHC$ $W/Z$ production),\nthe present calculations based on the $KMR$ prescriptions show a better\nagreement with the corresponding experimental data. This conclusion is\nachieved, due to the particular visualization of the angular ordering\nconstraint ($AOC$), despite the fact that the $LO-MRW$ and the $NLO-MRW$\nformalisms both employ better theoretical descriptions of the\n$Dokshitzer$-$Gribov$-$Lipatov$ -$Altarelli$-$Parisi$ ($DGLAP$) evolution\nequation, and hence are expected to produce better results. The form of the\n$AOC$ in the $KMR$ prescription automatically includes the re-summation of the\nhigher-order $ln({1/x})$ type contributions, i.e. the\n$Balitski$-$Fadin$-$Kuraev$-$Lipatov$ ($BFKL$) logarithms, in the $LO$-$DGLAP$\nevolution equation.\n", "  Soft components of the light cone wave-function of a fast moving projectile\nhadron is computed in perturbation theory to third order in QCD coupling\nconstant. At this order, the Fock space of the soft modes consists of\none-gluon, two-gluon, and a quark-antiquark states. The hard component of the\nwave-function acts as a non-Abelian background field for the soft modes and is\nrepresented by a valence charge distribution that accounts for non-linear\ndensity effects in the projectile. When scattered off a dense target, the\ndiagonal element of the S-matrix reveals the Hamiltonian of high energy\nevolution, the JIMWLK Hamiltonian. This way we provide a new direct derivation\nof the JIMWLK Hamiltonian at the Next-to-Leading Order.\n", "  We study numerically the geometric entanglement in the Laughlin wave\nfunction, which is of great importance in condensed matter physics. The Slater\ndeterminant having the largest overlap with the Laughlin wave function is\nconstructed by an iterative algorithm. The logarithm of the overlap, which is a\ngeometric quantity, is then taken as a geometric measure of entanglement. It is\nfound that the geometric entanglement is a linear function of the number of\nelectrons to a good extent. This is especially the case for the lowest Laughlin\nwave function, namely the one with filling factor of $1/3$. Surprisingly, the\nlinear behavior extends well down to the smallest possible value of the\nelectron number, namely, $ N= 2$. The constant term does not agree with the\nexpected topological entropy.\n", "  In this paper a Gaussian impurity moving through an equilibrium Bose-Einstein\ncondensate at T = 0 is studied. The problem can be described by a\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, which is solved perturbatively. The analysis is done\nfor systems of 2 and 3 spatial dimensions and generalises the work by [G.E.\nAstrakharchik and L.P. Pitaevskii, Phys. Rev. A 70, 013608 (2004)]. The\nBogoliubov equation solutions for the condensate perturbed by a finite impurity\nare calculated in the co-moving frame, which are formally equivalent up to a\ndimension dependent form factor for general dimensions. From those solutions\nthe total energy of the perturbed system is determined as a function of the\nwidth and the amplitude of the moving Gaussian impurity and its velocity.\nFinally we derive the drag force the Gaussian impurity approximately\nexperiences as it moves through the superfluid, which proofs the existence of a\nsuperfluid phase for finite extensions of the impurities below the speed of\nsound and that the force increases monotonically with velocity until it\ndecreases again.\n", "  We find a simple relation between two-dimensional BPS N=2 superconformal\nblocks and bosonic Virasoro conformal blocks, which allows us to analyze the\ncrossing equations for BPS 4-point functions in unitary (2,2) superconformal\ntheories numerically with semidefinite programming. We constrain gaps in the\nnon-BPS spectrum through the operator product expansion of BPS operators, in\nways that depend on the moduli of exactly marginal deformations through chiral\nring coefficients. In some cases, our bounds on the spectral gaps are observed\nto be saturated by free theories, by N=2 Liouville theory, and by certain\nLandau-Ginzburg models.\n", "  We have developed a technique to fabricate sub-micron, 0.6 um x 0.6 um\nAl-AlOx-Nb tunnel junctions using a standard e-beam resist, angle evaporation\nand double oxidation of the tunneling barrier, resulting in high quality\nniobium, as determined by the the high measured values of the critical\ntemperature TC 7.5 K and the gap 1.3 meV. The devices show great promise for\nlocal nanoscale thermometry in the temperature range 1 - 7.5 K. Electrical\ncharacterization of the junctions was performed at sub-Kelvin temperatures both\nwith and without an external magnetic field, which was used to suppress\nsuperconductivity in Al and thus bring the junction into a\nnormal-metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) configuration. We observed excess\nsub-gap current, which could not be explained by the standard tunneling theory.\nEvidence points towards materials science issues of the barrier or Nb/AlOx\ninterface as the culprit.\n", "  Cerium is a fascinating element exhibiting, with its different phases,\nlong-range magnetic order and superconductivity in bulk form. The coupling of\nthe 4f electron to sd conduction electrons and to the lattice is responsible\nfor unique structural and electronic properties like the isostructural\nfirst-order solid-solid transition from the cubic $\\gamma$ phase to the cubic\n$\\alpha$ phase, which is accompanied by a huge volume collapse of 14 %. While\nthe $\\gamma - \\alpha$ phase transition has been investigated for decades,\nexperiments aiming at disentangling the 4f contribution to the electric\nconductance of the different phases have not been performed. Here we report on\nthe strongly enhanced conductance of single-atom Ce contacts. By controlling\nthe content of $\\alpha$-Ce employing different rates of cooling, we find a\nstrong correlation between the fraction of $\\alpha$-Ce and the magnitude of the\nlast conductance plateau before the contact breaks. We attribute the enhanced\nconductance of $\\alpha$-Ce to the additional contribution of the 4f level.\n", "  In this work, we report for the first time, detailed calculations of elastic\nand thermodynamic properties of organic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene),\nPEDOT, in an undiluted state, using PBE and PBEsol-PAW pseudopotentials within\nthe framework of Generalized Gradient Approximation Density Functional Theory.\nContrary to Molecular Dynamic simulations, series of PBE and PBEsol-PAW\ncalculations in the current work revealed the most stable state of monoclinic\nstructured pristine PEDOT. We determined thirteen (13) independent elastic\nconstants with elastic compliance which enables us to establish other elastic\nproperties of pristine PEDOT; the Pugh's ratio and the Vicker's hardness\ncalculations show small mismatches with PBE and PBEsol-PAW pseudopotentials.\nThe Debye temperature TD is predicted both in the PBE and PBEsol-PAW\ncalculations while the specific heat capacity Cv(T) follows the Dulong-Petit\ncurve having no mismatch with Debye model at low temperature, with PBE\npredicting a higher Debye sound velocity than PBEsol-PAW. As accuracy tests\nonly, we performed electronic structure calculations of PEDOT and compared with\navailable data in the literature.\n"]}
