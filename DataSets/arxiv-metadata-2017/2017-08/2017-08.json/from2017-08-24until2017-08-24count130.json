We then apply it to two well-studied (spin-1/2 Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet) spin-lattice models, namely: the $XXZ$ and the $XY$ models on\nthe square lattice in two dimensions. Results are obtained in each case for the\nground-state energy, the sublattice magnetization and the quantum critical\npoint. They are in good agreement with those from such alternative methods as\nspin-wave theory, series expansions, quantum Monte Carlo methods and those from\nthe CCM using the LSUB$m$ scheme.\n", "  The GT200 is a device that has been extensively used by the Mexican armed\nforces to remotely detect and identify substances such as drugs and explosives.\nA double blind experiment has been performed to test its effectivity. In\nseventeen out of twenty attempts, the GT200 failed in the hands of certified\noperators to find more than 1600 amphetamine pills and four bullets hidden in a\nrandomly chosen cardboard box out of eight identical boxes distributed within a\n90m$\\times$20m ballroom. This result is compatible with the 1/8 probability\nexpected for a completely ineffectual device, and is incompatible with even a\nmoderately effective working one.\n", "  Gynecologic malignancies are a leading cause of death in women worldwide.\nStandard treatment for many primary and recurrent gynecologic cancer cases\nincludes a combination of external beam radiation, followed by brachytherapy.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is benefitial in diagnostic evaluation, in\nmapping the tumor location to tailor radiation dose, and in monitoring the\ntumor response to treatment. Initial studies of MR-guidance in gynecologic\nbrachtherapy demonstrate the ability to optimize tumor coverage and reduce\nradiation dose to normal tissues, resulting in improved outcomes for patients.\nIn this article we describe a methodology to aid applicator placement and\ntreatment planning for 3 Tesla (3T) MR-guided brachytherapy that was developed\nspecifically for gynecologic cancers. This has been used in 18 cases to date in\nthe Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating suite at Brigham and Women's\nHospital. It is comprised of state of the art methods for MR imaging, image\nanalysis, and treatment planning. An MR sequence using 3D-balanced steady state\nfree precession in a 3T MR scan was identified as the best sequence for\ncatheter identification with ballooning artifact at the tip. 3D treatment\nplanning was performed using MR images. Item in development include a software\nmodule designed to support virtual needle trajectory planning that includes\nprobabilistic bias correction, graph based segmentation, and image registration\nalgorithms. The results demonstrate that 3T MR has a role in gynecologic\nbrachytherapy. These novel developments improve targeted treatment to the tumor\nwhile sparing the normal tissues.\n", "  A generalisation of the classical covariance for quantum mechanical\nobservables has previously been presented by Gibilisco, Hiai and Petz.\nGibilisco and Isola has proved that the usual quantum covariance gives the\nsharpest inequalities for the determinants of covariance matrices. We introduce\na new generalisation of the classical covariance which gives better\ninequalities than the classical one furthermore it has a direct geometric\ninterpretation.\n", "  We present a lattice Monte Carlo simulation for a multiblock copolymer chain\nof length N=240 and microarchitecture $(10-10)_{12}$.The simulation was\nperformed using the Monte Carlo method with the Metropolis algorithm. We\nmeasured average energy, heat capacity, the mean squared radius of gyration,\nand the histogram of cluster count distribution. Those quantities were\ninvestigated as a function of temperature and incompatibility between segments,\nquantified by parameter {\\omega}. We determined the temperature of the\ncoil-globule transition and constructed the phase diagram exhibiting a variety\nof patchy nanostructures. The presented results yield a qualitative agreement\nwith those of the off-lattice Monte Carlo method reported earlier, with a\nsignificant exception for small incompatibilities,{\\omega}, and low\ntemperatures, where 3-cluster patchy nanostructures are observed in contrast to\nthe 2-cluster structures observed for the off-lattice $(10-10)_{12}$ chain. We\nattribute this difference to a considerable stiffness of lattice chains in\ncomparison to that of the off-lattice chains.\n", "  We prove that the ancestor Gromov-Witten correlation functions of\none-dimensional compact Calabi-Yau orbifolds are quasi-modular forms. This\nincludes the pillowcase orbifold which can not yet be handled by using\nMilanov-Ruan's B-model technique. We first show that genus zero modularity is\nobtained from the phenomenon that the system of WDVV equations is essentially\nequivalent to the set of Ramanujan identities satisfied by the generators of\nthe ring of quasi-modular forms for a certain modular group associated to the\norbifold curve. Higher genus modularity then follows by using tautological\nrelations.\n", "  Negative differential conductivity (NDC) is a widely exploited effect in\nmodern electronic components. Here, a proof-of-principle is given for the\nobservation of NDC in a quantum transport device for neutral atoms employing a\nmulti-mode tunneling junction. The transport of the many-body quantum system is\ngoverned by the interplay between the tunnel coupling, the interaction energy\nand the thermodynamics of intrinsic collisions, which turn the coherent\ncoupling into a hopping process. The resulting current voltage characteristics\nexhibit NDC, for which we identify a new microscopic physical mechanism. Our\nstudy opens new ways for the future implementation and control of complex\nneutral atom quantum circuits.\n", "  In this work, we study strongly interacting spinor atoms in a lattice subject\nto a 2 dimensional (2d) anisotropic Rashba type of spin orbital coupling (SOC)\nand an Zeeman field. We find the interplay between the Zeeman field and the SOC\nprovides a new platform to host rich and novel classes of quantum commensurate\nand in-commensurate phases, excitations and phase transitions. These\ncommensurate phases include two collinear states at low and high Zeeman field,\ntwo co-planar canted states at Mirror reflected SOC parameters respectively.\nMost importantly, there are non-coplanar incommensurate Skyrmion (IC-SkX)\ncrystal phases surrounded by the 4 commensurate phases. New excitation spectra\nabove all the 5 phases, especially on the IC-SKX phase are computed. Three\ndifferent classes of quantum commensurate to in-commensurate transitions from\nthe IC-SKX to its 4 neighboring commensurate phases are identified. Finite\ntemperature behaviors and transitions are discussed. The critical temperatures\nof all the phases can be raised above that reachable by current cold atom\ncooling techniques simply by tuning the number of atoms $ N $ per site. In view\nof recent impressive experimental advances in generating 2d SOC for cold atoms\nin optical lattices, these new many-body phenomena can be explored in the\ncurrent and near future cold atom experiments. Applications to various\nmaterials such as MnSi, Fe$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.5}$Si, especially the complex\nincommensurate magnetic ordering in Li$_2$IrO$_3$ are given.\n", "  Quantifying the forces between and within macromolecules is a necessary first\nstep in understanding the mechanics of molecular structure, protein folding,\nand enzyme function and performance. In such macromolecular settings, dynamic\nsingle-molecule force spectroscopy (DFS) has been used to distort bonds. The\nresulting responses, in the form of rupture forces, work applied, and\ntrajectories of displacements, have been used to reconstruct bond potentials.\nSuch approaches often rely on simple parameterizations of one-dimensional bond\npotentials, assumptions on equilibrium starting states, and/or large amounts of\ntrajectory data. Parametric approaches typically fail at inferring\ncomplex-shaped bond potentials with multiple minima, while piecewise estimation\nmay not guarantee smooth results with the appropriate behavior at large\ndistances. Existing techniques, particularly those based on work theorems, also\ndo not address spatial variations in the diffusivity that may arise from\nspatially inhomogeneous coupling to other degrees of freedom in the\nmacromolecule, thereby presenting an incomplete picture of the overall bond\ndynamics. To solve these challenges, we have developed a comprehensive\nempirical Bayesian approach that incorporates data and regularization terms\ndirectly into a path integral. All experiemental and statistical parameters in\nour method are estimated empirically directly from the data. Upon testing our\nmethod on simulated data, our regularized approach requires fewer data and\nallows simultaneous inference of both complex bond potentials and diffusivity\nprofiles.\n", "  We have studied the associative ionization of a Rydberg atom and a ground\nstate atom in an ultracold Rydberg gas. The measured scattering cross section\nis three orders of magnitude larger than the geometrical size of the produced\nmolecule. This giant enhancement of the reaction kinetics is due to an\nefficient directed mass transport which is mediated by the Rydberg electron. We\nalso find that the total inelastic scattering cross section is given by the\ngeometrical size of the Rydberg electron's wavefunction.\n", "  We experimentally study a driven-dissipative Josephson junction array,\nrealized with a weakly interacting Bose Einstein condensate residing in a\none-dimensional optical lattice. Engineered losses on one site act as a local\ndissipative process, while tunneling from the neighboring sites constitutes the\ndriving force. We characterize the emerging steady-states of this atomtronic\ndevice. With increasing dissipation strength $\\gamma$ the system crosses from a\nsuperfluid state, characterized by a coherent Josephson current into the lossy\nsite to a resistive state, characterized by an incoherent hopping transport.\nFor intermediate values of $\\gamma$, the system exhibits bistability, where a\nsuperfluid and a resistive branch coexist. We also study the relaxation\ndynamics towards the steady-state, where we find a critical slowing down,\nindicating the presence of a non-equilibrium phase transition.\n", "  The main goal of the present work is to analyze the cosmological scenario of\nthe induced gravity theory developed in previous works. Such a theory consists\non a Yang-Mills theory in a four-dimensional Euclidian spacetime with $SO(m,n)$\nsuch that $m+n=5$ and $m\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$ as its gauge group. This theory undergoes\na dynamical gauge symmetry breaking via an In\\\"on\\\"u-Wigner contraction in its\ninfrared sector. As a consequence, the $SO(m,n)$ algebra is deformed into a\nLorentz algebra with the emergency of the local Lorentz symmetries and the\ngauge fields being identified with a vierbein and a spin connection. As a\nresult, gravity is described as an effective Einstein-Cartan-like theory with\nultraviolet correction terms and a propagating torsion field. We show that the\ncosmological model associated with this effective theory has three different\nregimes. In particular, the high curvature regime presents a de Sitter phase\nwhich tends towards a $\\Lambda$CDM model. We argue that $SO(m,n)$ induced\ngravities are promising effective theories to describe the early phase of the\nuniverse.\n", "  We present a novel model of stochastic differential equations for foraging\nbehavior of fish schools in space including obstacles. We then study the model\nnumerically. Three configurations of space with different locations of food\nresource are considered. In the first configuration, fish move in free but\nlimited space. All individuals can find food almost surely. In the second and\nthird configurations, fish move in limited space with one or two obstacles. Our\nresults reveal that on one hand, when school size increases, so does the\nprobability of foraging success. On the other hand, when it exceeds an optimal\nvalue, the probability decreases. In all configurations, fish always keep a\nschool structure through the process of foraging.\n", "  In this paper we consider four competing interactions (external field,\nnearest neighbor, second neighbors and triples of neighbors) of models with\nuncountable (i.e. $[0,1]$) set of spin values on the Cayley tree of order two.\nWe reduce the problem of describing the \"splitting Gibbs measures\" of the model\nto the analysis of solutions to some nonlinear integral equation and study some\nparticular cases for Ising and Potts models. Also we show that periodic Gibbs\nmeasures for given models are either translation-invariant or periodic with\nperiod two and we give examples of the non-uniqueness of translation-invariant\nGibbs measures.\n", "  We consider two elementary (max-flow and uniform-flow) and two realistic\n(max-min fairness and proportional fairness) congestion control schemes, and\nanalyse how the algorithms and network structure affect throughput, the\nfairness of flow allocation, and the location of bottleneck edges. The more\nrealistic proportional fairness and max-min fairness algorithms have similar\nthroughput, but path flow allocations are more unequal in scale-free than in\nrandom regular networks. Scale-free networks have lower throughput than their\nrandom regular counterparts in the uniform-flow algorithm, which is favoured in\nthe complex networks literature. We show, however, that this relation is\nreversed on all other congestion control algorithms for a region of the\nparameter space given by the degree exponent $\\gamma$ and average degree ${k}$.\nMoreover, the uniform-flow algorithm severely underestimates the network\nthroughput of congested networks, and a rich phenomenology of path flow\nallocations is only present in the more realistic $\\alpha$-fair family of\nalgorithms. Finally, we show that the number of paths passing through an edge\ncharacterises the location of a wide range of bottleneck edges in these\nalgorithms. Such identification of bottlenecks could provide a bridge between\nthe two fields of complex networks and congestion control.\n", "  We investigate a novel hybrid system of a superconducting charge qubit\ninteracting directly with a single neutral atom via electric dipole coupling.\nInterfacing of the macroscopic superconducting circuit with the microscopic\natomic system is accomplished by varying the gate capacitance of the charge\nqubit. To achieve strong interaction, we employ two Rydberg states with an\nelectric-dipole allowed transition, which alters the polarizability of the\ndielectric medium of the gate capacitor. Sweeping the gate voltage with\ndifferent rates leads to a precise control of hybrid quantum states.\nFurthermore, we show a possible implementation of a universal two-qubit gate.\n", "  We propose a novel statistical model for sparse networks with overlapping\ncommunity structure. The model is based on representing the graph as an\nexchangeable point process, and naturally generalizes existing probabilistic\nmodels with overlapping block-structure to the sparse regime. Our construction\nbuilds on vectors of completely random measures, and has interpretable\nparameters, each node being assigned a vector representing its level of\naffiliation to some latent communities. We develop methods for simulating this\nclass of random graphs, as well as to perform posterior inference. We show that\nthe proposed approach can recover interpretable structure from two real-world\nnetworks and can handle graphs with thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of\nedges.\n", "  Obtaining full control over the internal and external quantum states of\nmolecules is the central goal of ultracold chemistry and allows for the study\nof coherent molecular dynamics, collisions and tests of fundamental laws of\nphysics. When the molecules additionally have a permanent electric dipole\nmoment, the study of dipolar quantum gases and spin-systems with long-range\ninteractions as well as applications in quantum information processing are\npossible. Rydberg molecules constitute a class of exotic molecules, which are\nbound by the interaction between the Rydberg electron and the ground state\natom. They exhibit extreme bond lengths of hundreds of Bohr radii and giant\npermanent dipole moments in the kilo-Debye range. A special type with\nexceptional properties are the so-called butterfly molecules, whose electron\ndensity resembles the shape of a butterfly. Here, we report on the\nphotoassociation of butterfly Rydberg molecules and their orientation in a weak\nelectric field. Starting from a Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium atoms, we\nfully control the external degrees of freedom and spectroscopically resolve the\nrotational structure and the emerging pendular states in an external electric\nfield. This not only allows us to extract the bond length, the dipole moment\nand the angular momentum of the molecule but also to deterministically create\nmolecules with a tunable bond length and orientation. We anticipate direct\napplications in quantum chemistry, many-body quantum physics and quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "  SUePDF is a graphic-user-interface program written in MATLAB to achieve\nquantitative pair distribution functions (PDF) from electron diffraction data.\nThe program facilitates the structural studies of amorphous materials and small\nnanoparticles based on electron diffraction data from transmission electron\nmicroscopes (TEMs). It is based on the physics of electron scattering as well\nas the total scattering methodology. A method of background modelling is\nintroduced to treat the intensity tail of the direct beam, inelastic scattering\nand incoherent multiple scattering. Kinematical electron scattering intensity\nis scaled using the electron scattering factors. The PDFs obtained after\nFourier transforms are normalized with respect to number density, nanoparticle\nform factor, and the non-negativity of probability density. SUePDF is\ndistributed as free software for academic users.\n", "  The reconstruction of the signal from hadrons and jets emerging from the\nproton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and entering the\nATLAS calorimeters is based on a three-dimensional topological clustering of\nindividual calorimeter cell signals. The cluster formation follows cell\nsignal-significance patterns generated by electromagnetic and hadronic showers.\nIn this, the clustering algorithm implicitly performs a topological noise\nsuppression by removing cells with insignificant signals which are not in close\nproximity to cells with significant signals. The resulting topological cell\nclusters have shape and location information, which is exploited to apply a\nlocal energy calibration and corrections depending on the nature of the\ncluster. Topological cell clustering is established as a well-performing\ncalorimeter signal definition for jet and missing transverse momentum\nreconstruction in ATLAS.\n", "  The Kondo-lattice model, which couples a lattice of localized magnetic\nmoments to conduction electrons, is often used to describe heavy-fermion\nsystems. Because of the interplay between Kondo physics and magnetic order it\ndisplays very complex behavior and is notoriously hard to solve. The\nferromagnetic Kondo-lattice model, with a ferromagnetic coupling between the\nlocal moments, describes a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase to a\nferromagnetic one as a function of either temperature or the ferromagnetic\nlocal-moment coupling. At zero temperature, this is a quantum phase transition\nthat has received considerable attention. It has been theoretically described\nto be continuous, or second order. Here we show that this belief is mistaken;\nin the absence of quenched disorder the quantum phase transition is first\norder, in agreement with experiments, as is the corresponding transition in\nother metallic ferromagnets.\n", "  We formulate an analytical recursive method to generate the wave function of\ndoped short-range resonating valence bond (RVB) states as a tool to efficiently\nestimate multisite entanglement as well as other physical quantities in doped\nquantum spin ladders. We prove that doped RVB ladder states are always genuine\nmultipartite entangled. Importantly, our results show that within specific\ndoping concentration and model parameter regimes, the doped RVB state\nessentially characterizes the trends of genuine multiparty entanglement in the\nexact ground states of the Hubbard model with large onsite interactions, in the\nlimit which yields the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian.\n", "  We have performed high resolution photoassociation spectroscopy of rubidium\nultra long-range Rydberg molecules in the vicinity of the 25$P$ state. Due to\nthe hyperfine interaction in the ground state perturber atom, the emerging\nmixed singlet-triplet potentials contain contributions from both hyperfine\nstates. We show that this can be used to induce remote spin-flips in the\nperturber atom upon excitation of a Rydberg molecule. When furthermore the\nspin-orbit splitting of the Rydberg state is comparable to the hyperfine\nsplitting in the ground state, the orbital angular momentum of the Rydberg\nelectron is entangled with the nuclear spin of the perturber atom. Our results\nopen new possibilities for the implementation of spin-dependent interactions\nfor ultracold atoms in bulk systems and in optical lattices.\n", "  Local gravitational theories with more than four derivatives are\nsuperrenormalizable, and also may be unitary in the Lee-Wick sense. Thus, it is\nrelevant to study the low-energy properties of these theories, especially to\nidentify observables which might be useful for experimental detection of higher\nderivatives. Using an analogy with the neutrino Physics, we explore the\npossibility of a gravitational seesaw mechanism, in which several dimensional\nparameters of the same order of magnitude produce a hierarchy in the masses of\npropagating particles. Such a mechanism could make a relatively light degree of\nfreedom detectable in low-energy laboratory and astrophysical observations,\nsuch as torsion balance experiments and the bending of light. We demonstrate\nthat such a seesaw mechanism in the six- and more-derivative theories is unable\nto reduce the lightest mass more than in the simplest four-derivative model.\nAdding more derivatives to the four-derivative action of gravity makes heavier\nmasses even greater, while the lightest massive ghost is not strongly affected.\nThis fact is favorable for protecting the theory from instabilities, but makes\nthe experimental detection of higher derivatives more difficult.\n", "  The secular thickening of a self-gravitating stellar galactic disc is\ninvestigated using the dressed collisionless Fokker-Planck equation and the\ninhomogeneous multicomponent Balescu-Lenard equation. The thick WKB limits for\nthe diffusion fluxes are found using the epicyclic approximation, while\nassuming that only radially tightly wound transient spirals are sustained by\nthe disc. This yields simple quadratures for the drift and diffusion\ncoefficients, providing a clear understanding of the positions of maximum\nvertical orbital diffusion within the disc, induced by fluctuations either\nexternal or due to the finite number of particles. These thick limits also\noffer a consistent derivation of a thick disc Toomre parameter, which is shown\nto be exponentially boosted by the ratio of the vertical to radial scale\nheights. Dressed potential fluctuations within the disc statistically induce a\nvertical bending of a subset of resonant orbits, triggering the corresponding\nincrease in vertical velocity dispersion. When applied to a tepid stable\ntapered disc perturbed by shot noise, these two frameworks reproduce\nqualitatively the formation of ridges of resonant orbits towards larger\nvertical actions, as found in direct numerical simulations, but overestimates\nthe time-scale involved in their appearance. Swing amplification is likely\nneeded to resolve this discrepancy, as demonstrated in the case of razor-thin\ndiscs. Other sources of thickening are also investigated, such as fading\nsequences of slowing bars, or the joint evolution of a population of giant\nmolecular clouds within the disc.\n", "  We have calculated the spectroscopic factor strengths for the one-proton and\none-neutron pick-up reactions $^{27}$Al($d$,$^{3}$He)$^{26}$Mg and\n$^{27}$Al($d$,$t$)$^{26}$Al within the framework of the shell model. We\nemployed two different $ab ~ initio$ approaches : an in-medium similarity\nrenormalization targeted for a particular nucleus, and the coupled- cluster\neffective interaction. We also compared our results with recently determined\nexperimental spectroscopic factors.\n", "  We consider the associated production of a scalar resonance with the standard\nmodel Higgs boson. We demonstrate via a realistic phenomenological analysis\nthat couplings of such a resonance to the Higgs boson can be constrained in a\nmeaningful way in future runs of the LHC, providing insights on its origin and\nits relation to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector. Moreover, the final\nstate can provide a direct way to determine whether the new resonance is\nproduced predominantly in gluon fusion or quark-anti-quark annihilation. The\nanalysis focusses on a resonance coming from a scalar field with vanishing\nvacuum expectation value and its decay to a photon pair. It can however be\nstraightforwardly generalised to other scenarios.\n", "  We analyze how the amount of work dissipated by a fixed nonequilibrium\nprocess depends on the initial distribution over states. Specifically, we\ncompare the amount of dissipation when the process is used with some specified\ninitial distribution to the minimal amount of dissipation possible for any\ninitial distribution. We show that the difference between those two amounts of\ndissipation is given by a simple information-theoretic function that depends\nonly on the initial and final state distributions. Crucially, this difference\nis independent of the details of the process relating those distributions. We\nthen consider how dissipation depends on the initial distribution for a\n'computer', i.e., a nonequilibrium process whose dynamics over coarse-grained\nmacrostates implement some desired input-output map. We show that our results\nstill apply when stated in terms of distributions over the computer's\ncoarse-grained macrostates. This can be viewed as a novel thermodynamic cost of\ncomputation, reflecting changes in the distribution over inputs rather than the\nlogical dynamics of the computation.\n", "  The effects which quantum fields and an $\\alpha_0 R^2$ term in the\ngravitational Lagrangian have on future singularities are investigated. While\nall values of $\\alpha_0$ are considered, an emphasis is placed on those values\nwhich are compatible with the universe having undergone Starobinsky inflation\nin the past. These are also values which lead to stable solutions to the\nsemiclassical backreaction equations in the present universe. The dark energy\nis modeled as a perfect fluid, and the focus is on type I-IV singularities and\nlittle rips which result when the classical Einstein equations are solved with\nvarious types of dark energy as a source. First, evidence is provided that the\nenergy densities of massive conformally coupled scalar fields approach that of\nthe conformally invariant scalar field as a type III singularity is approached.\nThen, solutions to the semiclassical backreaction equations are investigated\nwhen conformally invariant fields and the $ \\alpha_0 R^2$ term in the\ngravitational Lagrangian are present. General proofs regarding the behaviors of\nthe solutions are given. The proofs are illustrated by analytic and numerical\ncalculations in specific cases.\n", "  We present a generalized method to describe the x-ray scattering intensity of\nthe Bragg spots in a diffraction pattern from nanocrystals exposed to intense\nx-ray pulses. Our method involves the subdivision of a crystal into smaller\nunits. In order to calculate the dynamics within every unit we employ a\nMonte-Carlo (MC)-molecular dynamics (MD)-ab-initio hybrid framework using real\nspace periodic boundary conditions. By combining all the units we simulate the\ndiffraction pattern of a crystal larger than the transverse x-ray beam profile,\na situation commonly encountered in femtosecond nanocrystallography experiments\nwith focused x-ray free-electron laser radiation. Radiation damage is not\nspatially uniform and depends on the fluence associated with each specific\nregion inside the crystal. To investigate the effects of uniform and\nnon-uniform fluence distribution we have used two different spatial beam\nprofiles, gaussian and flattop.\n", "  Topological semimetals have recently attracted extensive research interests\nas host materials to condensed matter physics counterparts of Dirac and Weyl\nfermions originally proposed in high energy physics. These fermions with linear\ndispersions near the Dirac or Weyl points obey Lorentz invariance, and the\nchiral anomaly leads to novel quantum phenomena such as negative\nmagnetoresistance. The Lorentz invariance is, however, not necessarily\nrespected in condensed matter physics, and thus Lorentz-violating type-II Dirac\nfermions with strongly tilted cones can be realized in topological semimetals.\nHere, we report the first experimental evidence of type-II Dirac fermions in\nbulk stoichiometric PtTe$_2$ single crystal. Angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and first-principles calculations reveal a\npair of strongly tilted Dirac cones along the $\\Gamma$-A direction under the\nsymmetry protection, confirming PtTe$_2$ as a type-II Dirac semimetal. The\nrealization of type-II Dirac fermions opens a new door for exotic physical\nproperties distinguished from type-I Dirac fermions in condensed matter\nmaterials.\n", "  An efficient algorithm for SU(2) symmetric matrix product states (MPS) with\nperiodic boundary conditions (PBC) is proposed and implemented. It is applied\nto a study of the spectrum and correlation properties of the spin-1\nbilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model. We characterize the various phases of\nthis model by the lowest states of the spectrum with angular momentum J = 0, 1,\n2 for systems of up to 100 spins. Furthermore, we provide precision results for\nthe dimerization correlator as well as the string correlator.\n", "  In this article, we provide a detailed construction and analysis of the\nmathematical conformal field theory of the free fermion, defined in the sense\nof Graeme Segal. We verify directly that the operators assigned to disks with\ntwo disks removed correspond to vertex operators, and use this to deduce\nanalytic properties of the vertex operators. One of the main tools used in the\nconstruction is the Cauchy transform for Riemann surfaces, for which we\nestablish several properties analogous to those of the classical Cauchy\ntransform in the complex plane.\n", "  We derive the reciprocal cluster mean-field method to study the\nstrongly-interacting bosonic Harper-Hofstadter-Mott model. The system exhibits\na rich phase diagram featuring band insulating, striped superfluid, and\nsupersolid phases. Furthermore, for finite hopping anisotropy we observe\ngapless uncondensed liquid phases at integer fillings, which are analyzed by\nexact diagonalization. The liquid phases at fillings 1 and 3 exhibit the same\nband fillings as the fermionic integer quantum Hall effect, while the phase at\nfilling 2 is CT-symmetric with zero charge response. We discuss how these\nphases become gapped on a quasi-one-dimensional cylinder, leading to a\nquantized Hall response, which we characterize by introducing a suitable\nmeasure for non-trivial many-body topological properties. Incompressible\nmetastable states at fractional filling are also observed, indicating competing\nfractional quantum Hall phases. The combination of reciprocal cluster\nmean-field and exact diagonalization yields a promising method to analyze the\nproperties of bosonic lattice systems with non-trivial unit cells in the\nthermodynamic limit.\n", "  We present a method to deform (generically non-abelian) T duals of\ntwo-dimensional $\\sigma$ models, which preserves classical integrability. The\ndeformed models are identified by a linear operator $\\omega$ on the dualised\nsubalgebra, which satisfies the 2-cocycle condition. We prove that the\nso-called homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformations are equivalent, via a field\nredefinition, to our deformed models when $\\omega$ is invertible. We explain\nthe details for deformations of T duals of Principal Chiral Models, and present\nthe corresponding generalisation to the case of supercoset models.\n", "  The geometric separability probability of composite quantum systems is\nextensively studied in the last decades. One of most simple but strikingly\ndifficult problem is to compute the separability probability of qubit-qubit and\nrebit-rebit quantum states with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt measure. A lot\nof numerical simulations confirm the P(rebit-rebit)=29/64 and\nP(qubit-qubit)=8/33 conjectured probabilities. Milz and Strunz studied the\nseparability probability with respect to given subsystems. They conjectured\nthat the separability probability of qubit-qubit (and qubit-qutrit) depends on\nsum of single qubit subsystems (D), moreover it depends just on the Bloch radii\n(r) of D and it is constant in r. Using the Peres-Horodecki criterion for\nseparability we give mathematical proof for the P(rebit-rebit)=29/64\nprobability and we present an integral formula for the complex case which\nhopefully will help to prove the P(qubit-qubit)=8/33 probability too. We prove\nMilz and Strunz's conjecture for rebit-rebit and qubit-qubit states. The case,\nwhen the state space is endowed with the volume form generated by the operator\nmonotone function f(x)=sqrt(x) is studied too in detail. We show, that even in\nthis setting the Milz and Strunz's conjecture holds and we give an integral\nformula for separability probability according to this measure.\n", "  The large-scale structure of the universe can only be observed via luminous\ntracers of the dark matter. However, the clustering statistics of tracers are\nbiased and depend on various properties, such as their host-halo mass and\nassembly history. On very large scales this tracer bias results in a constant\noffset in the clustering amplitude, known as linear bias. Towards smaller\nnonlinear scales, this is no longer the case and tracer bias becomes a\ncomplicated function of scale and time. We focus on tracer bias centred on\ncosmic voids, depressions of the density field that spatially dominate the\nuniverse. We consider three types of tracers: galaxies, galaxy clusters and\nAGN, extracted from the hydrodynamical simulation Magneticum Pathfinder. In\ncontrast to common clustering statistics that focus on auto-correlations of\ntracers, we find that void-tracer cross-correlations are successfully described\nby a linear-bias relation. The tracer-density profile of voids can thus be\nrelated to their matter-density profile by a single number. We show that it\ncoincides with the linear tracer bias extracted from the large-scale\nauto-correlation function and expectations from theory, if sufficiently large\nvoids are considered. For smaller voids we observe a shift towards higher\nvalues. This has important consequences on cosmological parameter inference, as\nthe problem of unknown tracer bias is alleviated up to a constant number. The\nsmallest scales in existing datasets become accessible to simpler models,\nproviding numerous modes of the density field that have been disregarded so\nfar, but may help to further reduce statistical errors in constraining\ncosmology.\n", "  Angular momentum conservation has served as a guiding principle in the\ninterplay between spin dynamics and mechanical rotations. However, in an\nantiferromagnet with vanishing magnetization, new fundamental rules are\nrequired to properly describe spin-mechanical phenomena. Here we show that the\nN\\'eel order dynamics affects the mechanical motion of a rigid body by\nmodifying its inertia tensor in the presence of strong magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy. This effect depends on temperature when magnon excitations are\nconsidered. Such a spin-mechanical inertia can produce measurable consequences\nat small scales.\n", "  Coincidence and time-of-flight measurement techniques are employed to tag\nfission neutrons emitted from a 252Cf source sealed on one side with a very\nthin layer of Au. The source is positioned within a gaseous 4He scintillator\ndetector. Together with alpha particles, both light and heavy fission fragments\npass through the thin layer of Au and are detected. The fragments enable the\ncorresponding fission neutrons, which are detected in a NE-213\nliquid-scintillator detector, to be tagged. The resulting continuous\npolychromatic beam of tagged neutrons has an energy dependence that agrees\nqualitatively with expectations. We anticipate that this technique will provide\na cost-effective means for the characterization of neutron-detector efficiency\nin the energy range 1 - 6 MeV.\n", "  Hybrids consisting of macroscopic superconducting circuits and microscopic\ncomponents, such as atoms and spins, have the potential of transmitting an\narbitrary state between different quantum species, leading to the prospective\nof high-speed operation and long-time storage of quantum information. Here we\npropose a novel hybrid structure, where a neutral-atom qubit directly\ninterfaces with a superconducting charge qubit, to implement the qubit-state\ntransmission. The highly-excited Rydberg atom located inside the gate capacitor\nstrongly affects the behavior of Cooper pairs in the box while the atom in the\nground state hardly interferes with the superconducting device. In addition,\nthe DC Stark shift of the atomic states significantly depends on the\ncharge-qubit states. By means of the standard spectroscopic techniques and\nsweeping the gate voltage bias, we show how to transfer an arbitrary quantum\nstate from the superconducting device to the atom and vice versa.\n", "  We consider the conversion of an electric field into photons as a secondary\nprobe of the dynamical Schwinger process. In spatially homogeneous electric\nfields, quantum fluctuations of electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pairs are lifted\non the mass shell leaving asymptotically a small finite pair density. The\n$e^+e^-$ dynamics in turn couples to the quantized photon field and drives its\non-shell mode occupation. The spectral properties of the emerging asymptotic\nphotons accompanying the Schwinger process are calculated in lowest-order\nperturbation theory. Soft photons in the optical range are produced amass in\nthe sub critical region, thus providing a promising discovery avenue, e.g. for\nlaser parameters of the Extreme Light Initiative (ELI-NP) to be put in\noperation soon.\n", "  We propose a promising hybrid quantum system, where a highly-excited atom\nstrongly interacts with a superconducting LC oscillator via the electric field\nof capacitor. An external electrostatic field is applied to tune the energy\nspectrum of atom. The atomic qubit is implemented by two eigenstates near an\navoided-level crossing in the DC Stark map of Rydberg atom. Varying the\nelectrostatic field brings the atomic-qubit transition on- or off-resonance to\nthe microwave resonator, leading to a strong atom-resonator coupling with an\nextremely large cooperativity. Like the nonlinearity induced by Josephson\njunctions in superconducting circuits, the large atom-resonator interface\ndisturbs the harmonic potential of resonator, resulting in an artificial\ntwo-level particle. Different universal two-qubit logic gates can also be\nperformed on our hybrid system within the space where an atomic qubit couples\nto a single photon with an interaction strength much larger than any relaxation\nrates, opening the door to the cavity-mediated state transmission.\n", "  We present a systematic computation of the heat conductivity of the Markov\njump process modeling the energy exchanges in an array of locally confined hard\nspheres at the conduction threshold. Based on a variational formula [Sasada M.\n2016, {\\it Thermal conductivity for stochastic energy exchange models},\narXiv:1611.08866], explicit upper bounds on the conductivity are derived, which\nexhibit a rapid power-law convergence towards an asymptotic value. We thereby\nconclude that the ratio of the heat conductivity to the energy exchange\nfrequency deviates from its static contribution by a small negative correction,\nits dynamic contribution, evaluated to be $-0.000\\,373$ in dimensionless units.\nThis prediction is corroborated by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations which were\nsubstantially improved compared to earlier results.\n", "  Magnetism of transition metal (TM) oxides is usually described in terms of\nthe Heisenberg model, with orientation-independent interactions between the\nspins. However, the applicability of such a model is not fully justified for TM\noxides because spin polarization of oxygen is usually ignored. In the\nconventional model based on the Anderson principle, oxygen effects are\nconsidered as a property of the TM ion and only TM interactions are relevant.\nHere, we perform a systematic comparison between two approaches for spin\npolarization on oxygen in typical TM oxides. To this end, we calculate the\nexchange interactions in NiO, MnO, and hematite (Fe2O3) for different magnetic\nconfigurations using the magnetic force theorem. We consider the full spin\nHamiltonian including oxygen sites, and also derive an effective model where\nthe spin polarization on oxygen renormalizes the exchange interactions between\nTM sites. Surprisingly, the exchange interactions in NiO depend on the magnetic\nstate if spin polarization on oxygen is neglected, resulting in non-Heisenberg\nbehavior. In contrast, the inclusion of spin polarization in NiO makes the\nHeisenberg model more applicable. Just the opposite, MnO behaves as a\nHeisenberg magnet when oxygen spin polarization is neglected, but shows strong\nnon-Heisenberg effects when spin polarization on oxygen is included. In\nhematite, both models result in non-Heisenberg behavior. General applicability\nof the magnetic force theorem as well as the Heisenberg model to TM oxides is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We review the paradigm of holographic dark energy (HDE), which arises from a\ntheoretical attempt of applying the holographic principle (HP) to the dark\nenergy (DE) problem. Making use of the HP and the dimensional analysis, we\nderive the general formula of the energy density of HDE. Then, we describe the\nproperties of HDE model, in which the future event horizon is chosen as the\ncharacteristic length scale. We also introduce the theoretical explorations and\nthe observational constraints for this model. Next, in the framework of HDE, we\ndiscuss various topics, such as spatial curvature, neutrino, instability of\nperturbation, time-varying gravitational constant, inflation, black hole and\nbig rip singularity. In addition, from both the theoretical and the\nobservational aspects, we introduce the interacting holographic dark energy\nscenario, where the interaction between dark matter and HDE is taken into\naccount. Furthermore, we discuss the HDE scenario in various modified gravity\n(MG) theories, such as Brans-Dicke theory, braneworld theory, scalar-tensor\ntheory, Horava-Lifshitz theory, and so on. Besides, we introduce the attempts\nof reconstructing various scalar-field DE and MG models from HDE. Moreover, we\nintroduce other DE models inspired by the HP, in which different characteristic\nlength scales are chosen. Finally, we make comparisons among various\nHP-inspired DE models, by using cosmological observations and diagnostic tools.\n", "  We identify the parameter regions of the phenomenological minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model (pMSSM) with the minimal possible fine-tuning. We\nshow that the fine-tuning of the pMSSM is not large, nor under pressure by LHC\nsearches. Low sbottom, stop and gluino masses turn out to be less relevant for\nlow fine-tuning than commonly assumed. We show a link between low fine-tuning\nand the dark matter relic density. Fine-tuning arguments point to models with a\ndark matter candidate yielding the correct dark matter relic density: a\nbino-higgsino particle with a mass of $35-155$ GeV. Some of these candidates\nare compatible with recent hints seen in astrophysics experiments such as\nFermi-LAT and AMS-02. We argue that upcoming direct search experiments, such as\nXENON1T, will test all of the most natural solutions in the next few years due\nto the sensitivity of these experiments on the spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon\ncross section.\n", "  A single-ion reservoir has been tested, and characterized in order to be used\nas a highly sensitive optical detector of electric signals arriving at the\ntrapping electrodes. Our system consists of a single laser-cooled $^{40}$Ca$^+$\nion stored in a Paul trap with rotational symmetry. The performance is observed\nthrough the axial motion of the ion, which is equivalent to an underdamped and\nforced oscillator. Thus, the results can be projected also to Penning traps. We\nhave found that, for an ion oscillator temperature $T_{\\scriptsize{\\rm\naxial}}\\lesssim 10$~mK in the forced-frequency range $\\omega_z =2\\pi \\times\n(80,200$~kHz), the reservoir is sensitive to a time-varying electric field\nequivalent to an electric force of $5.3(2)$~neV/$\\mu $m, for a measured quality\nfactor $Q=3875(45)$, and a decay time constant $\\gamma_z=88(2)$~s$^{-1}$. This\nmethod can be applied to measure optically the strength of an oscillating field\nor induced (driven) charge in this frequency range within times of tens of\nmilliseconds. Furthermore the ion reservoir has been proven to be sensitive to\nelectrostatic forces by measuring the ion displacement. Since the heating rate\nis below $0.3$~$\\mu$eV/s, this reservoir might be used as optical detector for\nany ion or bunch of charged particles stored in an adjacent trap.\n", "  An important class of observables for gravitational waves consists of the\nfluxes of energy, momentum and angular momentum carried away by them and are\nwell understood for weak gravitational waves in Minkowski background. In de\nSitter background, the future null infinity, $\\mathcal{J}^+$, is space-like\nwhich makes the meaning of these observables subtle. A spatially compact source\nin de Sitter background also provides a distinguished null hypersurface, its\n{\\em cosmological horizon}, $\\mathcal{H}^+$. For sources supporting the short\nwavelength approximation, we adopt the Isaacson prescription to define an\neffective gravitational stress tensor. We show that the fluxes computed using\nthis effective stress tensor can be evaluated at $\\mathcal{H}^+$, match with\nthose computed at $\\mathcal{J}^+$ and also match with those given by Ashtekar\net al at $\\mathcal{J}^+$ {{\\em at a coarse grained level}}.\n", "  Does a closed quantum many-body system that is continually driven with a\ntime-dependent Hamiltonian finally reach a steady state? This question has only\nrecently been answered for driving protocols that are periodic in time, where\nthe long time behavior of the local properties synchronize with the drive and\ncan be described by an appropriate periodic ensemble. Here, we explore the\nconsequences of breaking the time-periodic structure of the drive with\nadditional aperiodic noise in a class of integrable systems. We show that the\nresulting unitary dynamics leads to new emergent steady states in at least two\ncases. While any typical realization of random noise causes eventual heating to\nan infinite temperature ensemble for all local properties in spite of the\nsystem being integrable, noise which is self-similar in time leads to an\nentirely different steady state, which we dub as \"geometric generalized Gibbs\nensemble\", that emerges only after an astronomically large time scale. To\nunderstand the approach to steady state, we study the temporal behavior of\ncertain coarse-grained quantities in momentum space that fully determine the\nreduced density matrix for a subsystem with size much smaller than the total\nsystem. Such quantities provide a concise description for any drive protocol in\nintegrable systems that are reducible to a free fermion representation.\n", "  We study the Dirac equation in a spacetime that represents the nonlinear\nsuperposition of the Schwarzchild solution to an external, stationary\nelectromagnetic Berttoti-Robinson solution. We separate the Dirac equation into\nradial and angular equations using Newman--Penrose formalism. We obtain exact\nanalytical solutions of the angular equations. We manage to obtain the radial\nwave equations with effective potentials. Finally, we study the potentials by\nplotting them as a function of radial distance and examine the effect of the\ntwisting parameter and the frequencies on the potentials.\n", "  Domain walls are minimizers of energy for coupled one-dimensional\nGross--Pitaevskii systems with nontrivial boundary conditions at infinity. It\nhas been shown that these solutions are orbitally stable in the space of\ncomplex $\\dot{H}^1$ functions with the same limits at infinity. In the present\nwork we adopt a new weighted $H^1$ space to control perturbations of the domain\nwalls and thus to obtain an improved orbital stability result. A major\ndifficulty arises from the degeneracy of linearized operators at the domain\nwalls and the lack of coercivity.\n", "  Topology optimization offers great opportunities to design permanent magnetic\nsystems that have specific external field characteristics. Additive\nmanufacturing of polymer bonded magnets with an end-user 3D printer can be used\nto manufacture permanent magnets with structures that have been difficult or\nimpossible to manufacture previously. This work combines these two powerful\nmethods to design and manufacture permanent magnetic system with specific\nproperties. The topology optimization framework is simple, fast, and accurate.\nIt can be also used for reverse engineering of permanent magnets in order to\nfind the topology from field measurements. Furthermore, a magnetic system that\ngenerate a linear external field above the magnet is presented. With a volume\nconstraint the amount of magnetic material can be minimized without losing\nperformance. Simulations and measurements of the printed system show a very\ngood agreement.\n", "  We derive asymptotic formulas for the solution of the derivative nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation on the half-line under the assumption that the initial\nand boundary values lie in the Schwartz class. The formulas clearly show the\neffect of the boundary on the solution. The approach is based on a nonlinear\nsteepest descent analysis of an associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.\n", "  The MiniBooNE-DM collaboration searched for vector-boson mediated production\nof dark matter using the Fermilab 8 GeV Booster proton beam in a dedicated run\nwith $1.86 \\times 10^{20}$ protons delivered to a steel beam dump. The\nMiniBooNE detector, 490~m downstream, is sensitive to dark matter via elastic\nscattering with nucleons in the detector mineral oil. Analysis methods\ndeveloped for previous MiniBooNE scattering results were employed, and several\nconstraining data sets were simultaneously analyzed to minimize systematic\nerrors from neutrino flux and interaction rates. No excess of events over\nbackground was observed, leading to a 90\\% confidence limit on the dark-matter\ncross section parameter, $Y=\\epsilon^2\\alpha_D(m_\\chi/m_V)^4 \\lesssim10^{-8}$,\nfor $\\alpha_D=0.5$ and for dark-matter masses of $0.01<m_\\chi<0.3~\\mathrm{GeV}$\nin a vector portal model of dark matter. This is the best limit from a\ndedicated proton beam dump search in this mass and coupling range and extends\nbelow the mass range of direct dark matter searches. These results demonstrate\na novel and powerful approach to dark matter searches with beam dump\nexperiments.\n", "  We present a novel approach to computing transition probabilities in quantum\nfield theory, which allows them to be written directly in terms of expectation\nvalues of nested commutators and anti-commutators of field operators, rather\nthan squared matrix elements. We show that this leads to a diagrammatic\nexpansion in which the retarded propagator plays a dominant role. As a result,\none is able to see clearly how faster-than-light signalling is prevented\nbetween sources and detectors. Finally, we comment on potential implications of\nthis approach for dealing with infra-red divergences.\n", "  The volume of data that will be produced by new-generation surveys requires\nautomatic classification methods to select and analyze sources. Indeed, this is\nthe case for the search for strong gravitational lenses, where the population\nof the detectable lensed sources is only a very small fraction of the full\nsource population. We apply for the first time a morphological classification\nmethod based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing strong\ngravitational lenses in $255$ square degrees of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS),\none of the current-generation optical wide surveys. The CNN is currently\noptimized to recognize lenses with Einstein radii $\\gtrsim 1.4$ arcsec, about\ntwice the $r$-band seeing in KiDS. In a sample of $21789$ colour-magnitude\nselected Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG), of which three are known lenses, the CNN\nretrieves 761 strong-lens candidates and correctly classifies two out of three\nof the known lenses. The misclassified lens has an Einstein radius below the\nrange on which the algorithm is trained. We down-select the most reliable 56\ncandidates by a joint visual inspection. This final sample is presented and\ndiscussed. A conservative estimate based on our results shows that with our\nproposed method it should be possible to find $\\sim100$ massive LRG-galaxy\nlenses at $z\\lsim 0.4$ in KiDS when completed. In the most optimistic scenario\nthis number can grow considerably (to maximally $\\sim$2400 lenses), when\nwidening the colour-magnitude selection and training the CNN to recognize\nsmaller image-separation lens systems.\n", "  I revisit the exactly solvable Kipnis--Marchioro--Presutti model of heat\nconduction [J. Stat. Phys. 27 65 (1982)] and describe, for one-dimensional\nsystems of arbitrary sizes whose ends are in contact with thermal baths at\ndifferent temperatures, a systematic characterization of their non-equilibrium\nstationary states. These arguments avoid resorting to the analysis of a dual\nprocess and yield a straightforward derivation of Fourier's law, as well as\nhigher-order static correlations, such as the covariant matrix. The\ntransposition of these results to families of gradient models generalizing the\nKMP model is established and specific cases are examined.\n", "  In this paper we discuss and review several aspects of the effect of boundary\nconditions and structured environments on dispersion and resonance interactions\ninvolving atoms or molecules, as well as on vacuum field fluctuations. We first\nconsider the case of a perfect mirror, which is free to move around an\nequilibrium position and whose mechanical degrees of freedom are treated\nquantum mechanically. We investigate how the quantum fluctuations of the\nmirror's position affect vacuum field fluctuations for both a one-dimensional\nscalar and electromagnetic field, showing that the effect is particularly\nsignificant in the proximity of the moving mirror. This result can be also\nrelevant for possible gravitational effects, since the field energy density\ncouples to gravity. We stress that this interaction-induced modification of the\nvacuum field fluctuations can be probed through the Casimir-Polder interaction\nwith a polarizable body, thus allowing to detect the effect of the mirror's\nquantum position fluctuations. We then consider the effect of an environment\nsuch as an isotropic photonic crystal or a metallic waveguide, on the resonance\ninteraction between two entangled identical atoms, one excited and the other in\nthe ground state. We discuss the strong dependence of the resonance interaction\nwith the relative position of the atomic transition frequency with the gap of\nthe photonic crystal in the former case, and with the cut-off frequency of\nwaveguide in the latter.\n", "  We discuss different physical effects related to the uniform acceleration of\natoms in vacuum, in the framework of quantum electrodynamics. We first\ninvestigate the van der Waals/Casimir-Polder dispersion and resonance\ninteractions between two uniformly accelerated atoms in vacuum. We show that\nthe atomic acceleration significantly affects the van der Waals force, yielding\na different scaling of the interaction with the interatomic distance and an\nexplicit time dependence of the interaction energy. We argue how these results\ncould allow for an indirect detection of the Unruh effect through dispersion\ninteractions between atoms. We then consider the resonance interaction between\ntwo accelerated atoms, prepared in a correlated Bell-type state, and\ninteracting with the electromagnetic field in the vacuum state, separating\nvacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction contributions, both in the\nfree-space and in the presence of a perfectly reflecting plate. We show that\nnonthermal effects of acceleration manifest in the resonance interaction,\nyielding a change of the distance dependence of the resonance interaction\nenergy. This suggests that the equivalence between temperature and acceleration\ndoes not apply to all radiative properties of accelerated atoms. To further\nexplore this aspect, we evaluate the resonance interaction between two atoms in\nnon inertial motion in the coaccelerated (Rindler) frame and show that in this\ncase the assumption of an Unruh temperature for the field is not required for a\ncomplete equivalence of locally inertial and coaccelerated points of views.\n", "  Working within the context of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, we begin by\ndescribing a non-Hermitian extension of QED that is both Lorentz invariant and\nconsistent with unitarity. We show that the non-Hermitian Dirac mass matrix of\nthis theory exhibits an exceptional point, corresponding to an effectively\nmassless theory whose conserved current is either right- or left-chiral\ndominated. With this inspiration, we are able to construct a non-Hermitian\nmodel of light Dirac neutrino masses from Hermitian and anti-Hermitian Yukawa\ncouplings that are both of order unity. We finish by highlighting potential\nphenomenological implications of this model.\n", "  We extend the global existence result for the derivative NLS equation to the\ncase when the initial datum includes a finite number of solitons. This is\nachieved by an application of the B\\\"acklund transformation that removes a\nfinite number of zeros of the scattering coefficient. By means of this\ntransformation, the Riemann--Hilbert problem for meromorphic functions can be\nformulated as the one for analytic functions, the solvability of which was\nobtained recently.\n", "  We study the second-order phase transition in the $d$-dimensional Ising model\nwith long-range interactions decreasing as a power of the distance $1/r^{d+s}$.\nFor $s$ below some known value $s_*$, the transition is described by a\nconformal field theory without a local stress tensor operator, with critical\nexponents varying continuously as functions of $s$. At $s=s_*$, the phase\ntransition crosses over to the short-range universality class. While the\nlocation $s_*$ of this crossover has been known for 40 years, its physics has\nnot been fully understood, the main difficulty being that the standard\ndescription of the long-range critical point is strongly coupled at the\ncrossover. In this paper we propose another field-theoretic description which,\non the contrary, is weakly coupled near the crossover. We use this description\nto clarify the nature of the crossover and make predictions about the critical\nexponents. That the same long-range critical point can be reached from two\ndifferent UV descriptions provides a new example of infrared duality.\n", "  With the Higgs mass now measured at the sub-percent level, the potential\nmetastability of the electroweak vacuum of the Standard Model (SM) motivates\nrenewed study of false vacuum decay in quantum field theory. In this note, we\ndescribe an approach to calculating quantum corrections to the decay rate of\nfalse vacua that is able to account fully and self-consistently for the\nunderlying inhomogeneity of the solitonic tunneling configuration. We show that\nthis method can be applied both to theories in which the instability arises\nalready at the level of the classical potential and those in which the\ninstability arises entirely through radiative effects, as is the case for the\nSM Higgs vacuum. We analyse two simple models in the thin-wall regime, and we\nshow that the modifications of the one-loop corrections from accounting fully\nfor the inhomogeneity can compete at the same level as the two-loop homogeneous\ncorrections.\n", "  We present a detailed theoretical study of the electronic, magnetic, and\nstructural properties of magnesiow\\\"ustite Fe$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$O with $x$ in the\nrange between 0$-$0.875 using a fully charge self-consistent implementation of\nthe density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT)\nmethod. In particular, we compute the electronic structure and phase stability\nof the rock-salt B1-structured (Fe,Mg)O at high pressures relevant for the\nEarth's lower mantle. We obtain that upon compression paramagnetic (Fe,Mg)O\nexhibits a spin-state transition of Fe$^{2+}$ ions from a high-spin to low-spin\n(HS-LS) state which is accompanied by a collapse of local magnetic moments. The\nHS-LS transition results in a substantial drop of the lattice volume by about\n4$-$8 %, implying a complex interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of\nfreedom. Our results reveal a strong sensitivity of the calculated transition\npressure $P_{\\rm tr.}$ upon addition of Mg. While for Fe-rich\nmagnesiow\\\"ustite, Mg $x < 0.5$, $P_{\\rm tr.}$ exhibits a rather weak variation\nat $\\sim$80 GPa, for Fe-poor (Fe,Mg)O it drops, e.g., by about 35 % to 52 GPa\nfor Mg $x=0.75$. This behavior is accompanied by a substantial change of the\nspin transition range from 50$-$140 GPa in FeO to 30$-$90 GPa for $x=0.75$. In\naddition, the calculated bulk modulus (in the HS state) is found to increase by\n$\\sim$12 % from 142 GPa in FeO to 159 GPa in (Fe,Mg)O with Mg $x=0.875$. We\nfind that the pressure-induced HS-LS transition has different consequences for\nthe electronic properties of the Fe-rich and poor (Fe,Mg)O. For the Fe-rich\n(Fe,Mg)O, the transition is found to be accompanied by a Mott insulator to\n(semi-) metal phase transition. In contrast to that, for $x>0.25$, (Fe,Mg)O\nremains insulating up to the highest studied pressures, implying a Mott\ninsulator to band insulator phase transition at the HS-LS transformation.\n", "  We study the electroweak baryogenesis in a fermionic dark matter scenario\nwith a (pseudo)scalar being the mediator in the Higgs portal. It is discussed\nthat the electroweak phase transition turns to be first-order after taking into\naccount the role of the (pseudo)scalar in the thermal effective potential in\nour extended standard model. Imposing the relic density constraint from the\nWMAP/Planck and the bounds from the direct detection experiments XENON100/LUX,\nwe show that the dark matter scenario with a scalar mediator is hardly capable\nof explaining the baryogenesis while the same model with a pseudoscalar\nmediator is able to explain the baryon asymmetry. For the latter, we constrain\nmore the model with {\\it Fermi}-LAT upper limit on dark matter annihilation\ninto $b\\bar b$ and $\\tau^+\\tau^-$. The allowed dark matter mass that leads to\ncorrect relic abundance, renders the electroweak phase transition strongly\nfirst-order, and respects the {\\it Fermi}-LAT limit, will be in the range\n$110-320$ GeV. The exotic and invisible Higgs decay bounds and the mono-jet\nsearch limit at the LHC do not affect the viable space of parameters.\n", "  When matter is exposed to a high-intensity x-ray free-electron-laser pulse,\nthe x rays excite inner-shell electrons leading to the ionization of the\nelectrons through various atomic processes and creating high-energy-density\nplasma, i.e., warm or hot dense matter. The resulting system consists of atoms\nin various electronic configurations, thermalizing on sub-picosecond to\npicosecond timescales after photoexcitation. We present a simulation study of\nx-ray-heated solid-density matter. For this we use XMDYN, a Monte-Carlo\nmolecular-dynamics-based code with periodic boundary conditions, which allows\none to investigate non-equilibrium dynamics. XMDYN is capable of treating\nsystems containing light and heavy atomic species with full electronic\nconfiguration space and 3D spatial inhomogeneity. For the validation of our\napproach we compare for a model system the electron temperatures and the ion\ncharge-state distribution from XMDYN to results for the thermalized system\nbased on the average-atom model implemented in XATOM, an ab-initio x-ray atomic\nphysics toolkit extended to include a plasma environment. Further, we also\ncompare the average charge evolution of diamond with the predictions of a\nBoltzmann continuum approach. We demonstrate that XMDYN results are in good\nquantitative agreement with the above mentioned approaches, suggesting that the\ncurrent implementation of XMDYN is a viable approach to simulate the dynamics\nof x-ray-driven non-equilibrium dynamics in solids. In order to illustrate the\npotential of XMDYN for treating complex systems we present calculations on the\ntriiodo benzene derivative 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid (I3C), a\ncompound of relevance of biomolecular imaging, consisting of heavy and light\natomic species.\n", "  We investigate the formation of virtual black holes in the context of\ngeneralized uncertainty principle (GUP), as a mediator for a proton decay\nprocess which is forbidden by the standard model. Then, we calculate the lower\nbounds of the GUP deformation parameter by the experimental bound on the half\nlife of the proton.\n", "  We report the development of a multichannel microscopy for whole-slide\nmultiplane, multispectral, and phase imaging. We use trinocular heads to split\nthe beam path into 6 independent channels and employ a camera array for\nparallel data acquisition, achieving a maximum data throughput of ~1 gigapixel\nper second. To perform single-frame rapid autofocusing, we place two\nnear-infrared LEDs at the back focal plane of the condenser lens to illuminate\nthe sample from two different incident angles. A hot mirror is used to direct\nthe near-infrared light to an autofocusing camera. For multiplane whole slide\nimaging (WSI), we acquire 6 different focal planes of a thick specimen\nsimultaneously. For multispectral WSI, we relay the 6 independent image planes\nto the same focal position and simultaneously acquire information at 6 spectral\nbands. For whole-slide phase imaging, we acquire images at 3 focal positions\nsimultaneously and use the transport-of-intensity equation to recover the phase\ninformation. We also provide an open-source design to further increase the\nnumber of channels from 6 to 15. The reported platform provides a simple\nsolution for multiplexed fluorescence imaging and multimodal WSI. Acquiring an\ninstant focal stack without z-scanning may also enable fast 3D dynamic tracking\nof various biological samples.\n", "  In this paper we construct a charged thin-shell gravastar model within the\ncontext of noncommutative geometry. To do so, we choose the interior of the\nnonsingular de Sitter spacetime with an exterior charged noncommutative\nsolution by cut-and-paste technique and apply the generalized junction\nconditions. We then investigate the stability of a charged thin-shell gravastar\nunder linear perturbations around the static equilibrium solutions as well as\nthe thermodynamical stability of the charged gravastar. We find the stability\nregions by choosing appropriate parameter values which is located sufficiently\nclose to the event horizon.\n", "  The nonlinear responses of different materials provide useful mechanisms for\noptical switching, low noise amplification, and harmonic frequency generation.\nHowever, the nonlinear processes usually have an extremely weak nature and\nrequire high input power to be excited. To alleviate this severe limitation, we\npropose new designs of ultrathin nonlinear metasurfaces composed of patterned\ngraphene micro-ribbons to significantly enhance third harmonic generation (THG)\nat far-infrared and terahertz (THz) frequencies. The incident wave is tightly\nconfined and significantly boosted along the surface of graphene in these\nconfigurations due to the excitation of highly localized plasmons. The\nbandwidth of the resonant response becomes narrower due to the introduction of\na metallic substrate below the graphene micro-ribbons, which leads to zero\ntransmission and standing waves inside the intermediate dielectric spacer\nlayer. The enhancement of the incident field, combined with the large nonlinear\nconductivity of graphene, can dramatically increase the THG conversion\nefficiency by several orders of magnitude. In addition, the resonant frequency\nof the metasurface can be adjusted by dynamically tuning the Fermi energy of\ngraphene via electrical or chemical doping. As a result, the third harmonic\ngenerated wave can be optimized and tuned to be emitted at different\nfrequencies without the need to change the nonlinear metasurface geometry. The\nproposed nonlinear metasurfaces provide a new way to realize compact and\nefficient nonlinear sources at the far-infrared and THz frequency ranges, as\nwell as new frequency generation and wave mixing devices which are expected to\nbe useful for nonlinear THz spectroscopy and noninvasive THz imaging\napplications.\n", "  We consider the most general asymptotically flat boundary conditions in\nthree-dimensional Einstein gravity in the sense that we allow for the maximal\nnumber of independent free functions in the metric, leading to six towers of\nboundary charges and six associated chemical potentials. We find as associated\nasymptotic symmetry algebra an isl(2)_k current algebra. Restricting the\ncharges and chemical potentials in various ways recovers previous cases, such\nas BMS_3, Heisenberg or Detournay-Riegler, all of which can be obtained as\ncontractions of corresponding AdS_3 constructions. Finally, we show that a flat\nspace contraction can induce an additional Carrollian contraction. As examples\nwe provide two novel sets of boundary conditions for Carroll gravity.\n", "  In this letter, we propose the extended Lorentz transformation in\nnoncommutative geometry, as a possibility on prohibition of the Higgs mass.\n  Since it is difficult to build the symmetry between the connections $A_{\\mu}$\nand $H$, the transformation is defined for the differential two-forms. The\nparameter of the transformation $\\omega$ changes a two-form into other\ntwo-forms. Comparing the coefficients of the two-forms, the transformations are\ntranslated to those of the product fields $F_{\\mu\\nu}, D_{\\mu} H$ and\n$HH^{\\dagger}$. It shows the invariance of the bosonic Lagrangian explicitly.\n", "  We propose a realistic scheme to implement discrete-time quantum walks in the\nBrillouin zone (i.e., in quasimomentum space) with a spinor Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. Relying on a static optical lattice to suppress tunneling in real\nspace, the condensate is displaced in quasimomentum space in discrete steps\nconditioned upon the internal state of the atoms, while short pulses\nperiodically couple the internal states. We show that tunable twisted boundary\nconditions can be implemented in a fully natural way by exploiting the\nperiodicity of the Brillouin zone. The proposed setup does not suffer from\noff-resonant scattering of photons and could allow a robust implementation of\nquantum walks with several tens of steps at least. In addition, onsite\natom-atom interactions can be used to simulate interactions with infinitely\nlong range in the Brillouin zone.\n", "  The strategy of shortcuts to adiabaticity enables us to realize adiabatic\ndynamics in finite time. In the counter-diabatic driving approach, an auxiliary\nHamiltonian which is called the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian is appended to an\noriginal Hamiltonian to cancel out diabatic transitions. The counter-diabatic\nHamiltonian is constructed by using the eigenstates of the original\nHamiltonian. Therefore, it is in general difficult to construct the\ncounter-diabatic Hamiltonian for quantum many-body systems. Even if the\ncounter-diabatic Hamiltonian for quantum many-body systems is obtained, it is\ngenerally non-local and even diverges at critical points. We construct an\napproximated counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for the infinite-range Ising model by\nmaking use of the mean-field approximation. An advantage of this method is that\nthe mean-field counter-diabatic Hamiltonian is constructed by only local\noperators. We numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through\nquantum annealing processes going the vicinity of the critical point. It is\nalso confirmed that the mean-field counter-diabatic Hamiltonian is still\nwell-defined in the limit to the critical point. The present method can take\nhigher order contributions into account and is consistent with the variational\napproach for local counter-diabatic driving.\n", "  We show that, in certain circumstances, exact excitation energies appear as\nlocally site-independent (or flat) modes if one records the excitation spectrum\nof the effective Hamiltonian while sweeping through the lattice in the\nvariational Matrix Product State formulation of the Density Matrix\nRenormalization Group (DMRG), a remarkable property since the effective\nHamiltonian is only constructed to target the ground state. Conversely, modes\nthat are very flat over several consecutive iterations are systematically found\nto correspond to faithful excitations. We suggest to use this property to\nextract accurate information about excited states using the standard ground\nstate algorithm. The results are spectacular for critical systems, for which\nthe low-energy conformal tower of states can be obtained very accurately at\nessentially no additional cost, as demonstrated by confirming the predictions\nof boundary conformal field theory for two simple minimal models - the\ntransverse-field Ising model and the critical three-state Potts model. This\napproach is also very efficient to detect the quasi-degenerate low-energy\nexcitations in topological phases, and to identify localized excitations in\nsystems with impurities. Finally, using the variance of the Hamiltonian as a\ncriterion, we assess the accuracy of the resulting Matrix Product State\nrepresentations of the excited states.\n", "  The density matrix renormalization group is one of the most powerful\nnumerical methods for computing ground-state properties of two-dimensional (2D)\nquantum lattice systems. Here we show its finite-temperature extensions are\nalso viable for 2D, using the following strategy: At high temperatures, we\ncombine density-matrix purification and numerical linked-cluster expansions to\nextract static observables directly in the thermodynamic limit. At low\ntemperatures inaccessible to purification, we use the minimally entangled\ntypical thermal state (METTS) algorithm on cylinders. We consider the\ntriangular Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a first application, finding excellent\nagreement with other state of the art methods. In addition, we present a\nMETTS-based approach that successfully extracts critical temperatures, and\napply it to a frustrated lattice model. On a technical level, we compare two\ndifferent schemes for performing imaginary-time evolution of 2D clusters,\nfinding that a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition with swap gates is currently the\nmost accurate and efficient.\n", "  Molecule-electrode contact atomic structures are a critical factor that\ncharacterizes molecular devices, but their precise understanding and control\nstill remain elusive. Based on combined first-principles calculations and\nsingle-molecule break junction experiments, we herein establish that the\nconductance of alkanedithiolate junctions can both increase and decrease with\nmechanical stretching and the specific trend is determined by the S-Au linkage\ncoordination number (CN) or the molecule-electrode contact atomic structure.\nSpecifically, we find that the mechanical pulling results in the conductance\nincrease for the junctions based on S-Au CN two and CN three contacts, while\nthe conductance is minimally affected by stretching for junctions with the CN\none contact and decreases upon the formation of Au monoatomic chains. Detailed\nanalysis unravels the mechanisms involving the competition between the\nstretching-induced upshift of the highest occupied molecular orbital-related\nstates toward the Fermi level of electrodes and the deterioration of\nmolecule-electrode electronic couplings in different contact CN cases.\nMoreover, we experimentally find a higher chance to observe the conductance\nenhancement mode under a faster elongation speed, which is explained by ab\ninitio molecular dynamics simulations that reveal an important role of thermal\nfluctuations in aiding deformations of contacts into low-coordination\nconfigurations that include monoatomic Au chains. Pointing out the\ninsufficiency in previous notions of associating peak values in conductance\nhistograms with specific contact atomic structures, this work resolves the\ncontroversy on the origins of ubiquitous multiple conductance peaks in\nS-Au-based single-molecule junctions.\n", "  We calculate log corrections to the entropy of three-dimensional black holes\nwith \"soft hairy\" boundary conditions. Their thermodynamics possesses some\nspecial features that preclude a naive direct evaluation of these corrections,\nso we follow two different approaches. The first one exploits that the BTZ\nblack hole belongs to the spectrum of Brown-Henneaux as well as soft hairy\nboundary conditions, so that the respective log corrections are related through\na suitable change of the thermodynamic ensemble. In the second approach the\nanalogue of modular invariance is considered for dual theories with anisotropic\nscaling of Lifshitz type with dynamical exponent z at the boundary. On the\ngravity side such scalings arise for KdV-type boundary conditions, which\nprovide a specific 1-parameter family of multi-trace deformations of the usual\nAdS3/CFT2 setup, with Brown-Henneaux corresponding to z=1 and soft hairy\nboundary conditions to the limiting case z=0. Both approaches agree in the case\nof BTZ black holes for any non-negative z. Finally, for soft hairy boundary\nconditions we show that not only the leading term, but also the log corrections\nto the entropy of black flowers endowed with affine u(1) soft hair charges\nexclusively depend on the zero modes and hence coincide with the ones for BTZ\nblack holes.\n", "  Nearby dwarf galaxies provide a unique laboratory in which to test stellar\npopulation models below $Z_\\odot/2$. Such tests are particularly important for\ninterpreting the surprising high-ionization UV line emission detected at $z>6$\nin recent years. We present HST/COS ultraviolet spectra of ten nearby\nmetal-poor star-forming galaxies selected to show He II emission in SDSS\noptical spectra. The targets span nearly a dex in gas-phase oxygen abundance\n($7.8<12+\\log\\mathrm{O/H}<8.5$) and present uniformly large specific star\nformation rates (sSFR $\\sim 10^2$ $\\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$). The UV spectra confirm\nthat metal-poor stellar populations can power extreme nebular emission in\nhigh-ionization UV lines, reaching C III] equivalent widths comparable to those\nseen in systems at $z\\sim 6-7$. Our data reveal a marked transition in UV\nspectral properties with decreasing metallicity, with systems below\n$12+\\log\\mathrm{O/H}\\lesssim 8.0$ ($Z/Z_\\odot \\lesssim 1/5$) presenting minimal\nstellar wind features and prominent nebular emission in He II and C IV. This is\nconsistent with nearly an order of magnitude increase in ionizing photon\nproduction beyond the $\\mathrm{He^+}$-ionizing edge relative to H-ionizing flux\nas metallicity decreases below a fifth solar, well in excess of standard\nstellar population synthesis predictions. Our results suggest that often\nneglected sources of energetic radiation such as stripped binary products and\nvery massive O-stars produce a sharper change in the ionizing spectrum with\ndecreasing metallicity than expected. Consequently, nebular emission in C IV\nand He II powered by these stars may provide useful metallicity constraints in\nthe reionization era.\n", "  Many useful properties of dilute Bose gases at ultra-low temperature are\npredicted precisely by the (mean-field) product-state Ansatz, in which all\nparticles are in the same quantum state. Yet, in situations where\nparticle-particle correlations become important, the product Ansatz fails. To\ninclude correlations nonperturbatively, we consider a new set of states: the\nparticle-correlated state of $N=l\\times n$ bosons is derived by symmetrizing\nthe $n$-fold product of an $l$-particle quantum state. The particle-correlated\nstates can be simulated efficiently for large $N$, because their parameter\nspaces, which depend on $l$, do not grow with $n$. Here we formulate and\ndevelop in great detail the pure-state case for $l=2$, where the many-body\nstate is constructed from a two-particle pure state. These paired wave\nfunctions, which we call pair-correlated states (PCS), were introduced by A. J.\nLeggett [Rev. Mod. Phys. ${\\bf 73}$, 307 (2001)] as a\nparticle-number-conserving version of the Bogoliubov approximation. We present\nan iterative algorithm that solves for the reduced (marginal) density matrices\n(RDMs), i.e., the correlation functions, associated with PCS in time $O(N)$.\nThe RDMs can also be derived from the normalization factor of PCS, which is\nderived analytically in the large-$N$ limit. To test the efficacy of PCS, we\nanalyze the ground state of the two-site Bose-Hubbard model by minimizing the\nenergy of the PCS~state, both in its exact form and in its large-$N$\napproximate form, and comparing with the exact ground state. For $N=1\\,000$,\nthe relative errors of the ground-state energy for both cases are within\n$10^{-5}$ over the entire parameter region from a single condensate to a Mott\ninsulator. We present numerical results that suggest that PCS might be useful\nfor describing the dynamics in the strongly interacting regime.\n", "  We investigate different methods of passivating sidewalls of wet etched InAs\nheterostructures in order to suppress inherent edge conduction that is presumed\nto occur due to band bending at the surface leading to charge carrier\naccumulation. Passivation techniques including sulfur, positively charged\ncompensation dopants and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition of\n$\\mathrm{SiN}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ do not show an improvement. Surprisingly, atomic\nlayer deposition of $\\mathrm{Al}_{\\mathrm{2}}\\mathrm{O}_{\\mathrm{3}}$ leads to\nan increase in edge resistivity of more than an order of magnitude. While the\nmechanism behind this change is not fully understood, possible reasons are\nsuggested.\n", "  Diffusion, transport of mass in response to concentration and thermal energy\ngradient, is an important transport property, vital in material science and\nlife science. In the present work classical molecular dynamics study of\ndiffusion of zwittterion glycine, zwitterion diglycine and zwitterion\ntriglycine in water have been carried out. Self and binary diffusion\ncoefficients of aqueous solution of these molecules have been calculated using\nEinstein method. Our results agree with experimental data reported in\nliteratures. Temperature dependency of diffusion of glycine in water have been\nexplored using estimated values of self and binary diffusion coefficients at\nfour different temperatures. Effect of peptide bond formation in diffusion has\nbeen studied using peptide chain composed of up to three monomers of glycine.\nThe structure of the system is analyzed using radial diestibution function of\ndifferent atom.\n", "  We propose a hybrid quantum system, where an $LC$ resonator inductively\ninteracts with a flux qubit and is capacitively coupled to a Rydberg atom.\nVarying the external magnetic flux bias controls the flux-qubit flipping and\nthe flux qubit-resonator interface. The atomic spectrum is tuned via an\nelectrostatic field, manipulating the qubit-state transition of atom and the\natom-resonator coupling. Different types of entanglement of superconducting,\nphotonic, and atomic qubits can be prepared via simply tuning the flux bias and\nelectrostatic field, leading to the implementation of three-qubit Toffoli logic\ngate.\n", "  We present ALMA observations of the dust continuum and [C II] 158um line\nemission from the z=6.0695 Lyman Break Galaxy WMH5. These observations at 0.3\"\nspatial resolution show a compact (~3kpc) main galaxy in dust and [C II]\nemission, with a 'tail' of emission extending to the east by about 5kpc (in\nprojection). The [C II] tail is comprised predominantly of two distinct\nsub-components in velocity, separated from the core by ~100 and 250km/s, with\nnarrow intrinsic widths of about 80km/s, which we call 'sub-galaxies'. The\nsub-galaxies themselves are extended east-west by about 3kpc in individual\nchannel images. The [C II] tail joins smoothly into the main galaxy velocity\nfield. The [C II] line to continuum ratios are comparable for the main and\nsub-galaxy positions, within a factor 2. In addition, these ratios are\ncomparable to z~5.5 LBGs. We conjecture that the WMH5 system represents the\nearly formation of a galaxy through the accretion of smaller satellite\ngalaxies, embedded in a smoother gas distribution, along a possibly filamentary\nstructure. The results are consistent with current cosmological simulations of\nearly galaxy formation, and support the idea of very early enrichment with dust\nand heavy elements of the accreting material.\n", "  High velocity gas that does not conform to Galactic rotation is observed\nthroughout the Galaxy's halo. One component of this gas, HI high velocity\nclouds (HVCs), have attracted attention since their discovery in the 1960s and\nremain controversial in terms of their origins, largely due to the lack of\nreliable distance estimates. The recent discovery of enhanced magnetic fields\ntowards HVCs has encouraged us to explore their connection to cloud evolution,\nkinematics, and survival as they fall through the magnetized Galactic halo. For\na reasonable model for the halo magnetic field, most infalling clouds see\ntransverse rather than radial field lines. We find that significant compression\n(and thereby amplification) of the ambient magnetic field occurs in front of\nthe cloud and in the tail of material stripped from the cloud. The compressed\ntransverse field attenuates hydrodynamical instabilities. This delays cloud\ndestruction, though not indefinitely. The observed B-field compression is\nrelated to the cloud's distance from the Galactic plane. As a result, the\nobserved rotation measure provides useful distance information on a cloud's\nlocation.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to derive sharp asymptotics of the ground state\nenergy for the heavy atoms and molecules in the relativistic settings, and, in\nparticular, to derive relativistic Scott correction term and also Dirac,\nSchwinger and relativistic correction terms. Also we will prove that\nThomas-Fermi density approximates the actual density of the ground state, which\nopens the way to estimate the excessive negative and positive charges and the\nionization energy.\n", "  E. M. Purcell showed that a body has to perform non-reciprocal motion in\norder to propel itself in a highly viscous environment. The swimmer with one\ndegree of freedom is bound to do reciprocal motion, whereby the center of mass\nof the swimmer will not be able to propel itself due to the Scallop theorem. In\nthe present study, we are proposing a new artificial swimmer called the one\nhinge swimmer. Here we will show that flexibility plays a crucial role in the\nbreakdown of Scallop theorem in the case of one-hinge swimmer or\ntwo-dimensional scallop at low Reynolds number. To model a one-hinge artificial\nswimmer, we use bead spring model for two arms joined by a hinge with bending\npotential for the arms in order to make them semi-flexible. The fluid is\nsimulated using a particle based mesoscopic simulation method called the\nmulti-particle collision dynamics with Anderson thermostat. Here we show that\nwhen our swimmer has rigid arms, the center of mass of the swimmer is not able\nto propel itself as expected from the Scallop theorem. When we introduce\nflexibility in the arms, the time reversal symmetry breaks in the case of the\none-hinged swimmer without the presence of a head contrary to the one-armed\nsuper paramagnetic swimmer which required a passive head in order to swim. The\nreduced velocity of the swimmer is studied using a range of parameters like\nflexibility, beating frequency and the amplitude of the beat, where we obtain\nsimilar scaling as that of the one-armed super paramagnetic swimmer. We also\ncalculate the dimensionless Sperm number for the swimmer and we get the maximum\nvelocity when the Sperm number is around 1.7.\n", "  In this paper, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the\nthermodynamics of a black geometry with hyperscaling violation. These thermal\nfluctuations in the thermodynamics of this system are produced from quantum\ncorrections of geometry describing this system. We discuss the stability of\nthis system using specific heat and the entire Hessian matrix of the free\nenergy. We will analyze the effects of thermal fluctuations on the stability of\nthis system. We also analyze the effects of thermal fluctuations on the\ncriticality of the Hyperscaling violation background.\n", "  Bound state solutions of the Schrodinger Equation for the $-a/r^2$ potential\nhave been presented recently for both the weak and strong coupling cases.\nHowever, Shortley in 1931 and Landau and Lifshitz in 1958 claimed that no bound\nstate solutions exist for the weak coupling case when $0 < 2ma/\\hbar^2 <= (l +\n1/2)^2$. We demonstrate that one bound state solution can exist for each\nangular momentum state l, and that a complete orthogonal set of continuum\neigenfunctions orthogonal to the bound state eigenfunction can be constructed\nwhen $l(l+ 1) < 2ma/\\hbar^2 <= (l + 1/2)^2$. We show that Shortley's argument\nis spurious due to his neglecting a boundary term arising from the momentum\noperator and that the Landau and Lifshitz claim is based on a restrictive\nfitting of the exterior solution to an interior spherical well. Instead, to\neach weak coupling, a, we find a unique interior well strength $V_{in} =\n-a'/ro^2$ which yields a finite bound state. In particular for the l = 0 case\nthe well strength is given by: $2ma'/\\hbar^2 = 1.3734 + 2.2265*(1/4 -\n2ma'/\\hbar^2)^{1/2}$.\n", "  Environmental pollutants, such as colors from the textile industry, affect\nwater quality indicators like color, smell, and taste. These substances in the\nwater cause the obstruction of filters and membranes and thereby reduce the\nefficiency of advanced water treatment processes. In addition, they are harmful\nto human health because of reaction with disinfectants and production of\nby-products. Iron oxide nanoparticles are considered effective absorbents for\nthe removal of pollutants from aqueous environments. In order to increase the\nstability and dispersion, nanospheres with iron oxide core and titanium dioxide\ncoating were used in this research and their ability to absorb Congo red color\nwas evaluated. Iron oxide-titanium oxide nanospheres were prepared based on the\ncoprecipitation method and then their physical properties were determined using\na tunneling electron microscope (TEM) and an X-ray diffraction device.\nMorphological investigation of the absorbent surface showed that iron\noxide-titanium oxide nanospheres sized about 5 to 10 nm. X-ray dispersion\nsurvey also suggested the high purity of the sample. In addition, the\nabsorption rate was measured in the presence of ultrasound waves and the\nresults indicated that the capacity of the synthesized sample to absorb Congo\nred is greatly dependent on the intensity power of ultrasound waves, as the\nabsorption rate reaches 100% at powers above 30 watts.\n", "  The simulation of light scattering by particles on a substrate with the\n$T$-matrix method relies on the expansion of the scattered field in spherical\nwaves, followed by a plane wave expansion to allow the evaluation of the\nreflection from the substrate. In practice, the plane wave expansion (i.e., the\nSommerfeld integrals) needs to be truncated at a maximal in-plane wavenumber\n$\\kappa_\\mathrm{max}$. An appropriate selection of $\\kappa_\\mathrm{max}$ is\nessential: counter-intuitively, the overall accuracy can degrade significantly\nif the integrals are truncated with a too large value. In this paper, we\npropose an empirical formula for the selection of $\\kappa_\\mathrm{max}$ and\ndiscuss its application using a number of example simulations with dielectric\nand metallic oblate spheroids on dielectric and metallic substrates. The\ncomputed differential scattering cross sections are compared to results\nobtained from the discrete-sources method.\n", "  Jet substructure is playing a central role at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nprobing the Standard Model in extreme regions of phase space and providing\ninnovative ways to search for new physics. Analytic calculations of\nexperimentally successful observables are a primary catalyst driving\ndevelopments in jet substructure, allowing for a deeper understanding of\nobservables and for the exploitation of increasingly subtle features of jets.\nIn this paper we present a field theoretic framework enabling systematically\nimprovable calculations of groomed multi-prong substructure observables, which\nbuilds on recent developments in multi-scale effective theories. We use this\nframework to compute for the first time the full spectrum for groomed tagging\nobservables at the LHC, carefully treating both perturbative and\nnon-perturbative contributions in all regions. Our analysis enables a precision\nunderstanding which we hope will improve the reach and sophistication of jet\nsubstructure techniques at the LHC.\n", "  We have discovered heavy obscuration in the dual active galactic nucleus\n(AGN) in the Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) source SWIFT J2028.5+2543 using\nNuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). While an early XMM-Newton study\nsuggested the emission was mainly from NGC 6921, the superior spatial\nresolution of NuSTAR above 10 keV resolves the Swift/BAT emission into two\nsources associated with the nearby galaxies MCG +04-48-002 and NGC 6921 (z =\n0.014) with a projected separation of 25.3 kpc (91\"). NuSTAR's sensitivity\nabove 10 keV finds both are heavily obscured to Compton-thick levels (N\nH=(1-2)x10^24 cm-2) and contribute equally to the BAT detection ({L}10-50\n{keV}{{int}}= 6x10^42 erg s-1). The observed luminosity of both sources is\nseverely diminished in the 2-10 keV band, illustrating the importance of >10\nkeV surveys like those with NuSTAR and Swift/BAT. Compared to archival X-ray\ndata, MCG +04-48-002 shows significant variability (>3) between observations.\nDespite being bright X-ray AGNs, they are difficult to detect using optical\nemission-line diagnostics because MCG +04-48-002 is identified as a\nstarburst/composite because of the high rates of star formation from a luminous\ninfrared galaxy while NGC 6921 is only classified as a LINER using line\ndetection limits. SWIFT J2028.5+2543 is the first dual AGN resolved above 10\nkeV and is the second most heavily obscured dual AGN discovered to date in the\nX-rays other than NGC 6240.\n", "  We consider constraints on the S-matrix of any gapped, Lorentz invariant\nquantum field theory in 3+1 dimensions due to crossing symmetry, analyticity\nand unitarity. We extremize cubic couplings, quartic couplings and scattering\nlengths relevant for the elastic scattering amplitude of two identical scalar\nparticles. In the cases where our results can be compared with the older\nS-matrix literature they are in excellent agreement. We also extremize a cubic\ncoupling in 2+1 dimensions which we can directly compare to a universal bound\nfor a QFT in AdS. This paper generalizes our previous 1+1 dimensional results\nof arXiv:1607.06109 and arXiv:1607.06110.\n", "  This paper reports on an approach for fabrication of micro-channels with\nnanometer thickness achieved by optimization of UV lithography processes.\nRectangular micro-channels with a staple edge are fabricated over the surface\nof a silicon wafer substrate in which a sub-micron layer of diluted SU-8 thin\nfilm has been coated. The optimization of the process parameters including the\nduration of a two-step pre- and post-baking process, UV exposure dosage, and\nfinally chemical developing time with constant agitation produces\nmicro-channels with high contrast edges and thickness below 100 nm is achieved.\nThe dimensions achieved using this approach has potential applications in\nsub-micron optical waveguides and nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) devices.\n", "  The twentieth century was a period of outstanding economic growth together\nwith an unequal income distribution. This paper analyses the international\ndistribution of growth rates and its dynamics during the twentieth century. We\nshow that the whole century is characterized by a high heterogeneity in the\ndistribution of GDP per capita growth rates, which is reflected in different\nshapes and a persistent asymmetry of the distributions at the regional level\nand for countries of different development levels. We find that in the context\nof the global conflicts that characterized the first half of the twentieth\ncentury and involved mainly large economies, the well-known negative scale\nrelation between volatility and size of countries is not significant. After the\nyear 1956, a redistribution of volatility leads to a significant negative\nscale-relation, which has been recently considered as a robust feature of the\nevolution of economic organizations. Our results contribute with more empirical\nfacts that call the attention to traditional macroeconomic theories to better\nexplain the underlying complexity of the growth process and sheds light on its\nhistorical evolution.\n", "  Galaxies at high redshifts with strong star formation are sources of\nhigh-energy cosmic rays. These cosmic rays interact with the baryon and\nradiation fields of the galactic environment via photo-pair, photo-pion and\nproton-proton processes to produce charged and neutral pions, neutrons and\nprotons. The cosmic rays thereby deposit energy into the interstellar medium\n(ISM) as they propagate. We show how energy transport and deposition by ultra\nhigh-energy cosmic rays is regulated by the evolution of the galaxy, in\nparticular by the development of the galactic magnetic field. We show how the\nparticle-driven energy deposition can influence the thermal evolution of the\nhost and its surroundings. Using a parametric protogalaxy model, we calculate\nthe heating effect on the ISM as the cosmic rays are increasingly confined by\nthe magnetic evolution of the galaxy.\n", "  Calculating amplitudes for the flavor changing transitions in terms of the\noff-diagonal elements of mass matrices, so called \"Mass Insertions\" (MI) in the\ntheory defined in \"gauge basis\" (before mass matrix diagonalization) is the\ncommon technique in analyzing the flavor structure of the New Physics models. I\npresent a general method allowing to expand any QFT amplitude calculated in the\nmass-eigenstates (physical) basis into series in MI's, to any required order.\nThe technique is purely algebraic, translating an amplitude written in the mass\neigenbasis into MI series without performing diagrammatic calculations in the\ngauge basis. It can be applied for all types of mass matrices - either\nHermitian (scalar or vector), general complex (Dirac fermions) or complex\nsymmetric (Majorana fermions). Proposed expansion has been also automatized in\nthe form of publicly available specialized Mathematica package, MassToMI, which\nfeatures I illustrate with the example of the Higgs boson decays in the MSSM.\n", "  English translation of a Russian Ph.D. thesis from 1936. No original\nabstract, translator's abstract: The thesis consists of two chapters. In\nchapter I, general requirements to be imposed on any nonlinear electrodynamics\nand their implementation in the electrodynamics of Born and Infeld are\ndiscussed. In chapter II, within the nonlinear electrodynamics of Born the\npropagation of a light wave in the presence of a homogeneous electric or\nmagnetic field as well as the interaction of two plane light waves in vacuo are\nstudied.

We show the\ncompatibility of these Lax equations and that they are equivalent to a set of\nzero curvature relations. We present a linearization of the system and conclude\nby giving a wide construction of solutions of this hierarchy.\n", "  A method of transmitting information in interstellar space at superluminal,\nor $> c$, speeds is proposed. The information is encoded as phase modulation of\nan electromagnetic wave of constant intensity, i.e. fluctuations in the rate of\nenergy transport plays no role in the communication, and no energy is\ntransported at speed $>$ c. Of course, such a constant wave can ultimately last\nonly the duration of its enveloping wave packet. However, as a unique feature\nof this paper, we assume the source is sufficiently steady to be capable of\nemitting wave packets, or pulses, of size much larger than the separation\nbetween sender and receiver. Therefore, if a pre-existing and enduring wave\nenvelope already connects the two sides, the subluminal nature of the\nenvelope's group velocity will no longer slow down the communication, which is\nnow limited by the speed at which information encoded as phase modulation\npropagates through the plasma, i.e. the phase velocity $v_p > c$. The method\ninvolves no sharp structure in either time or frequency. As a working example,\nwe considered two spaceships separated by 1 lt-s in the local hot bubble.\nProvided the bandwidth of the extra Fourier modes generated by the phase\nmodulation is much smaller than the carrier wave frequency, the radio\ncommunication of a message, encoded as a specific alignment between the carrier\nwave phase and the anomalous (modulated) phase, can take place at a speed in\nexcess of light by a few parts in 10$^{11}$ at $\\nu\\approx 1$~GHz, and higher\nat smaller $\\nu$.\n", "  The energies as a function of the magnetic field ($H$) and the pressure are\nstudied theoretically in the tight-binding model for the two-dimensional\norganic conductor,\n  $\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$, in which massless Dirac fermions are realized.\nThe effects of the uniaxial pressure ($P$) are studied by using the\npressure-dependent hopping parameters. The system is semi-metallic with the\nsame area of an electron pocket and a hole pocket at $P < 3.0$~kbar, where the\nenergies $(\\varepsilon_{\\rm D}^0$) at the Dirac points locate below the Fermi\nenergy $(\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}^0$) when $H=0$. We find that at $P=2.3$~kbar the\nDirac cones are critically tilted. In that case a new type of band crossing\noccurs at \"three-quarter\"-Dirac points, i.e., the dispersion is quadratic in\none direction and linear in the other three directions. We obtain new\nmagnetic-field-dependences of the Landau levels $(\\varepsilon_n)$;\n$\\varepsilon_n-\\varepsilon^0_{\\textrm{D}} \\propto (n H)^{4/5}$ at $P=2.3$~kbar\n(\"three-quarter\"-Dirac points) and $|\\varepsilon_n-\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}^0|\n\\propto (n H)^2$ at $P=3.0$~kbar (the critical pressure for the semi-metallic\nstate). We also study the magnetization as a function of the inverse magnetic\nfield. We obtain two types of quantum oscillations. One is the usual de Haas\nvan Alphen (dHvA) oscillation, and the other is the unusual dHvA-like\noscillation which is seen even in the system without the Fermi surface.\n", "  It has been a long-standing problem to detect interstellar glycine\n(NH$_2$CH$_2$COOH), the simplest amino acid, in studying a possible relation\nbetween the Universe and origin of life. In the last about 40 years all surveys\nof glycine failed, and it would be an alternative strategy to search for\nprecursor(s) to glycine. Such studies of precursors would be crucial prior to\nconducting sensitive surveys by ALMA.\n  Laboratory studies have suggested that CH$_3$NH$_2$ is a possible precursor\nto glycine. Further theoretical study also suggested that the CH$_2$NH$_2$\nradical that can be formed from CH$_3$NH$_2$ through photodissociation can be a\ngood precursor to glycine. Thus we observed CH$_3$NH$_2$ towards several hot\ncore sources by using the Nobeyama 45m radio telescope, and succeeded in\nfinding a new CH$_3$NH$_2$ source, G10.47+0.03, with its fractional abundance\nof 2.4+-0.6x10^{-8}; at the time of writing, this source is the most abundant\nsource of CH$_3$NH$_2$ ever known. We also found another new source of\nCH$_3$NH$_2$, NGC6334F, however, the detection may be tentative since the\nsignal-to-noise ratios are not sufficient to claim secure detection. Detailed\nanalysis of the detected data revealed the detection of the hyperfine\ncomponents of CH$_3$NH$_2$ for the first time. We found that the observed\nabundance of CH$_3$NH$_2$ agrees fairly well with the theoretically predicted\nvalue by Garrod (2013). Detectability of interstellar glycine is discussed.\n", "  In this study, the deformation of nylon6/silica nanocomposite is investigated\nby employing a multiscale computational approach to understand the influence of\nnanoparticles. Initially, the upper and lower bounds for the elastic properties\nof a combination of crystalline and amorphous lamella are predicted via Voigt\nand Reuss model. Subsequently, these results are used in an FEM model for RVEs\nrepresenting the multi-spherulitic structure of nylon6 and a silica/nylon6\nnanocomposite. Each spherulite in these models has directional mechanical\nproperties defined by spherical coordinates. Simulation of deformation applied\nin orthogonal directions and the mechanical response of the pure polymer and\nnanocomposite are examined. The results show that spherical nanoparticles have\na smaller potential for enhancement of mechanical response compared to\nnanoparticles of other shapes.\n", "  Supersymmetry is one of the most motivated scenarios for physics beyond the\nStandard Model. This article summarizes recent ATLAS results on searches for\nsupersymmetry in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV\nat LHC, which target supersymmetric particles produced by strong interaction in\nevents with leptonic final states. No significant excess above the Standard\nModel expectation is observed and exclusion limits have been set on squark and\ngluino masses in various scenarios.\n", "  Large Eddy Simulations of a flow at a moderate Reynolds number over and\naround a three-dimensional hill have been performed. The main aim of the\nsimulations was to study the effects of various inflow conditions (boundary\nlayer thickness and laminar versus turbulent boundary layers) on the flow\nbehind the hill. The main features of the flow behind the hill are similar in\nall simulations, however various differences are observed. The topology of the\nstreamlines (friction lines) on the surface adjacent to the lower wall was\nfound to be independent of the inflow conditions prescribed and comprised four\nsaddle points and four nodes (of which two are foci). In all simulations a\nvariety of vortical structures could be observed, ranging from a horseshoe\nvortex - that was formed at the foot of the hill - to a train of large hairpin\nvortices in the wake of the hill. In the simulation with a thick incoming\nlaminar boundary layer also secondary vortical structures (i.e. hairpin\nvortices) were observed to be formed at either side of the hill, superposed on\nthe legs of the horseshoe vortex. Sufficiently far downstream of the hill, at\nthe symmetry plane the mean velocity and the rms of the velocity fluctuations\nwere found to become quasi-independent of the inflow conditions, while towards\nthe sides the influence of the hill decreases and the velocity profiles recover\nthe values prevailing at the inflow.\n", "  After the discovery of the gravitational waves and the observation of\nneutrinos of cosmic origin, we have entered a new and exciting era where cosmic\nrays, neutrinos, photons and gravitational waves will be used simultaneously to\nstudy the highest energy phenomena in the Universe. Here we present a fully\nBayesian approach to the challenge of combining and comparing the wealth of\nmeasurements from existing and upcoming experimental facilities. We discuss the\nprocedure from a theoretical point of view and using simulations, we also\ndemonstrate the feasibility of the method by incorporating the use of\ninformation provided by different theoretical models and different experimental\nmeasurements.\n", "  Traffic flow oscillations, including traffic waves, are a common yet\nincompletely understood feature of congested traffic. Possible mechanisms\ninclude traffic flow instabilities, indifference regions or finite human\nperception thresholds (action points), and external acceleration noise.\nHowever, the relative importance of these factors in a given situation remains\nunclear. We bring light into this question by adding external noise and action\npoints to the Intelligent Driver Model and other car-following models thereby\nobtaining a minimal model containing all three oscillation mechanisms. We show\nanalytically that even in the subcritical regime of linearly stable flow (order\nparameter $\\epsilon<0$), external white noise leads to spatiotemporal speed\ncorrelations \"anticipating\" the waves of the linearly unstable regime.\nSufficiently far away from the threshold, the amplitude scales with\n$(-\\epsilon)^{-0.5}$. By means of simulations and comparisons with experimental\ncar platoons and bicycle traffic, we show that external noise and indifference\nregions with action points have essentially equivalent effects. Furthermore,\nflow instabilities dominate the oscillations on freeways while external noise\nor action points prevail at low desired speeds such as vehicular city or\nbicycle traffic. For bicycle traffic, noise can lead to fully developed waves\neven for single-file traffic in the subcritical regime.\n", "  Films of graphene oxide (GO) were produced on the inner walls of glass\nmicrocapillaries via insertion of a GO water suspension followed by quick\ndrying with a hot finger (no previous surface functionalization required).\nIndividual capillaries from an array could also be selectively GO coated. Raman\nhyperspectral images revealed the films to be continuous along tens of\ncentimeters. Furthermore, the films could be thermally reduced through an\nannealing process, which also decreased the concentration of defects. As a\nproof of principle application, the microcapillaries of photonic crystal fibers\nwere covered with a GO film, leading to the demonstration of fiber polarizers\nand mode lockers for pulsed fiber lasers. A comparison between GO- and reduced\nGO-coated fibers revealed that shorter pulses are obtained with the latter.\n", "  In this work, the static stability of plates with fixed trailing edges in\naxial airflow is studied using the framework of Possio integral equation.\nFirst, we introduce a new derivation of a Possio integral equation that relates\nthe pressure jump along thin plates to their downwash based on the\nlinearization of the governing equations of an ideal compressible fluid. The\nsteady state solution to the Possio equation is used to account for the\naerodynamic forces in the steady state plate governing equation resulting in a\nsingular differential-integral equation which is transformed to an integral\nequation. Next, we verify the solvability of the integral equation based on the\nFredholm alternative for compact operators in Banach spaces and the contraction\nmapping theorem. Then, we derive explicit formulas for the characteristic\nequations of free-clamped and free-pinned plates. The minimum solutions to the\ncharacteristic equations are the divergence speeds which indicate when static\ninstabilities start to occur. We show analytically that free-pinned plates are\nstatically unstable. After that, we move to derive analytically flow speed\nintervals that correspond to static stability regions for free-clamped plates.\nWe also resort to numerical computations to obtain an explicit formula for the\ndivergence speed of free-clamped plates. Finally, we apply the obtained results\non piezoelectric plates and we show that free-clamped piezoelectric plates are\nstatically more stable than conventional free-clamped plates due to the\npiezoelectric coupling.\n", "  Nanofabrication of photonic components based on dielectric-loaded surface\nplasmon-polariton waveguides (DLSPPWs) excited by single nitrogen vacancy (NV)\ncenters in nanodiamonds is demonstrated. DLSPPW circuits are built around NV\ncontaining nanodiamonds, which are certified to be single-photon emitters,\nusing electron-beam lithography of hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) resist on\nsilver-coated silicon substrates. A propagation length of ~20 {\\mu}m for the NV\nsingle-photon emission is measured with DLSPPWs. A 5-fold enhancement in the\ntotal decay rate and up to 63% coupling efficiency to the DLSPPW mode is\nachieved, indicating significant mode confinement. Finally, we demonstrate\nrouting of single plasmons with DLSPPW-based directional cou-plers, revealing\nthe potential of our approach for on-chip realization of quantum-optical\nnetworks.\n", "  Using the standard ETAS model of triggered seismicity, we present a rigorous\ntheoretical analysis of the main statistical properties of temporal clusters,\ndefined as the group of events triggered by a given main shock of fixed\nmagnitude m that occurred at the origin of time, at times larger than some\npresent time t. Using the technology of generating probability function (GPF),\nwe derive the explicit expressions for the GPF of the number of future\noffsprings in a given temporal seismic cluster, defining, in particular, the\nstatistics of the cluster's duration and the cluster's offsprings maximal\nmagnitudes. We find the remarkable result that the magnitude difference between\nthe largest and second largest event in the future temporal cluster is\ndistributed according to the regular Gutenberg-Richer law that controls the\nunconditional distribution of earthquake magnitudes. For earthquakes obeying\nthe Omori-Utsu law for the distribution of waiting times between triggering and\ntriggered events, we show that the distribution of the durations of temporal\nclusters of events of magnitudes above some detection threshold \\nu has a power\nlaw tail that is fatter in the non-critical regime $n<1$ than in the critical\ncase n=1. This paradoxical behavior can be rationalised from the fact that\ngenerations of all orders cascade very fast in the critical regime and\naccelerate the temporal decay of the cluster dynamics.\n", "  We introduce a general scheme to detect various multiparticle entanglement\nstructures from global non-permutationally invariant observables. In\nparticular, we derive bounds on the variance of non-permutationally invariant\nand collective operators for the verification of $k$-party entanglement. For a\nfamily of observables related to the spin structure factor, we give\nquantitative bounds on entanglement that are independent of the total number of\nparticles. We introduce highly non-symmetric states with genuine multipartite\nentanglement that is verifiable with the presented technique and discuss how\nthey can be prepared with trapped ions exploiting the high degree of control in\nthese systems. As a special case, our framework provides an alternative\napproach to obtain a tight relaxation of the entanglement criterion by S{\\o}\nrensen and M{\\o} lmer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 4431 (2001)] that is free from\ntechnical assumptions and allows to calculate the bounds with an improved\nscaling in the detectable depth.\n", "  Particle coarsening and grain growth take place to minimize the total\ninterfacial energy. The classical mean-field treatments by Lifshitz, Slyozov,\n[1] Wagner [2] and Hillert [3] predicted cubic growth law under bulk-diffusion\ncontrolled precipitation coarsening and parabolic growth law under interface\ncontrolled grain growth, as well as their steady-state size distribution. When\nthe size distribution is the steady-state one, the average grain size satisfies\nthe following dependence: under bulk-diffusion control and under interface\ncontrol, with correct slopes definitely given by the theory. However, when the\nsize distribution does not satisfy the steady-state one, the growth kinetics\nwould deviate from theoretical prediction. As is shown by numerical simulations\nin Ref. 4 and 5, the deviation is less obvious in the growth law, but more\nevident in the slope of the growth curve. Specifically, starting from a\nnon-steady-state size distribution, the parabolic/cubic growth law would be\nrecovered quickly, yet the convergence of the slope in the or curve is\nextremely slow. Therefore, it would be interesting to know how to calculate the\ninstantaneous slope of the growth kinetics from an arbitrarily given size\ndistribution. As will be shown below, assuming a known growth law, the\nanalytical solution can be easily obtained and the exact solution can be\nobtained by numerical integration.\n", "  This work presents the mathematical and computational aspects of a smooth\ndissipative particle dynamics with dynamic virtual particle allocation method\n(SDPD-DV) for modeling and simulation of mesoscopic fluids in wall-bounded\ndomains. The SDPD-DV method is realized with fluid particles, boundary\nparticles and dynamically allocated virtual particles near solid boundaries.\nThe physical domain in SDPD-DV contains external and internal solid boundaries,\nperiodic inlets and outlets, and the fluid region. The solid boundaries of the\ndomain are represented with boundary particles which have an assigned position,\nwall velocity, and temperature upon initialization. The fluid domain is\ndiscretized with fluid particles placed in a global index. The algorithm for\nnearest neighbor particle search is based on a combination of the linked-cell\nand Verlet-list approaches and utilizes large rectangular cells for\ncomputational efficiency. The density model of a fluid particle in the\nproximity of a solid boundary includes the contribution from the virtual\nparticles in its truncated support domain. The thermodynamic properties of a\nvirtual particle are identical to those of the corresponding fluid particle.\nAdditional verification involves SDPD-DV simulations of transient, planar,\nCouette liquid water flow. The top plate is moving at and separated by 10-3 m\nfrom the bottom stationary plate. The numerical results are in very good\nagreement with the analytical solutions. Additional SDPD-DV verification is\naccomplished with the simulation of a body-force driven, low-Reynolds number\nflow of water over a cylinder of radius . The SDPD-DV field velocity and\npressure are compared with those obtained by FLUENT.\n", "  The thermal stability of most electronic and photo-electronic devices\nstrongly depends on the relationship between Schottky Barrier Height (SBH) and\ntemperature. In this paper, the possible of thermionic current depicted via\ncorrect and reliability relationship between forward current and voltage is\nconsequently discussed, the intrinsic SBH insensitive to temperature can be\ncalculated by modification on Richardson- Dushman`s formula suggested in this\npaper. The results of application on four hetero-junctions prove that the\nmethod proposed is credible in this paper, this suggests that the I/V/T method\nis a feasible alternative to characterize these heterojunctions.\n", "  A model of nonlinear electrodynamics with two parameters, coupled with\ngeneral relativity, is investigated. We study the magnetized black hole and\nobtain solutions. The asymptotic of the metric and mass functions at\n$r\\rightarrow\\infty$ and $r\\rightarrow 0$, and corrections to the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m solution are found. We investigate thermodynamics of\nblack holes and calculate the Hawking temperature and heat capacity of black\nholes. It is shown that there are phase transitions and at some parameters of\nthe model black holes are stable.\n", "  We report the detection during the JEM-X/INTEGRAL observations of several\nX-ray bursters of series of close type I X-ray bursts consisting of two or\nthree events with a recurrence time much shorter than the characteristic (at\nthe observed mean accretion rate) time of matter accumulation needed for a\nthermonuclear explosion to be initiated on the neutron star surface. We show\nthat such series of bursts are naturally explained in the model of a spreading\nlayer of accreting matter over the neutron star surface in the case of a\nsufficiently high ($\\dot{M}\\geq 1\\times 10^{-9}\\ M_{\\odot}\\ \\mbox{yr}^{-1}$)\naccretion rate (corresponding to a mean luminosity $L_{\\rm tot}\\geq 1\\times\n10^{37} \\mbox{erg s}^{-1}$). The existence of triple bursts requires some\nrefinement of the model - the importance of a central ring zone is shown. In\nthe standard model of a spreading layer no infall of matter in this zone is\nbelieved to occur.\n", "  The application of deep learning techniques using convolutional neural\nnetworks to the classification of particle collisions in High Energy Physics is\nexplored. An intuitive approach to transform physical variables, like momenta\nof particles and jets, into a single image that captures the relevant\ninformation, is proposed. The idea is tested using a well known deep learning\nframework on a simulation dataset, including leptonic ttbar events and the\ncorresponding background at 7 TeV from the CMS experiment at LHC, available as\nOpen Data. This initial test shows competitive results when compared to more\nclassical approaches, like those using feedforward neural networks.\n", "  The measured experimental results of optical diffraction of 10, 5 and 3.4\nmicrometer period plasmonic surface relief grating are presented for the\napplication of band-pass filter in visible spectral range. Conventional\nscanning electron microscopic (SEM) is used to fabricate the grating structures\non the silver halide based film (substrate) by exposing the electron beam in\nraster scan fashion. Morphological characterization of the gratings is\nperformed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows that the period, height and\nprofile depends on the line per frame, beam spot, single line dwell time, beam\ncurrent, and accelerating voltage of the electron beam. Optical transmission\nspectra of 10 micrometer period grating shows a well-defined localized surface\nplasmon resonance (LSPR) dip at ~366 nm wavelength corresponding to gelatin\nembedded silver nanoparticles of the grating structure. As the period of the\ngrating reduces LSPR dip becomes prominent. The maximum first order diffraction\nefficiency (DE) and bandwidth for 10 micrometer period grating are observed as\n4% and 400 nm in 350 nm to 800 nm wavelength range respectively. The DE and\nbandwidth are reduced up to 0.03% and 100 nm for 3.4 micrometer period grating.\nThe profile of DE is significantly flat within the diffraction bandwidth for\neach of the gratings. An assessment of the particular role of LSPR absorption\nand varied grating period in the development of the profile of first order DE\nv/s wavelength are studied. Fabrication of such nano-scale structures in a\nlarge area using conventional SEM and silver halide based films may provide the\nsimple and efficient technique for various optical devices applications.\n", "  This dissertation presents a new coupled electro-mechanical model that is an\nimprovement on the classical parallel-plate approximation. The model employs a\nhyperbolic function to account for the beam deformed shape and electrostatic\nfield. Based on this, the model can accurately calculate the deflection of a\nfixed-fixed beam subjected to an applied voltage and the switch\ncapacitance-voltage characteristics without using parallel-plate assumption.\nFor model validation, the model solutions are compared with ANSYS finite\nelement results and experimental data. It is found that the model works\nespecially well in residual stress dominant and stretching dominant cases. The\nmodel shows that the nonlinear stretching can significantly increase the\npull-in voltage and extend the beam maximum travel range. Based on the model, a\ngraphene nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) resonator is simulated and the\nagreement with the experimental data is excellent. The proposed coupled\nhyperbolic model demonstrates its capacity to guide the design and optimization\nof both RF microelectromechanical system (MEMS) capacitive switches and NEMS\ndevices.\n", "  The effect of the photoinduced absorption of terahertz (THz) radiation in a\nsemi-insulating GaAs crystal is studied by the pulsed THz transmission\nspectroscopy. We found that a broad-band modulation of THz radiation may be\ninduced by a low-power optical excitation in the spectral range of the impurity\nabsorption band in GaAs. The measured modulation achieves 80\\%. The amplitude\nand frequency characteristics of the resulting THz modulator are critically\ndependent on the carrier density and relaxation dynamics in the conduction band\nof GaAs. In semi-insulating GaAs crystals, the carrier density created by the\nimpurity excitation is controlled by the rate of their relaxation to the\nimpurity centers. The relaxation rate and, consequently, the frequency\ncharacteristics of the modulator can be optimized by an appropriate choice of\nthe impurities and their concentrations. The modulation parameters can be also\ncontrolled by the crystal temperature and by the power and photon energy of the\noptical excitation. These experiments pave the way to the low-power fast\noptically-controlled THz modulation, imaging, and beam steering.\n", "  By combining deep optical imaging and infrared spectroscopy with data from\nthe Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and from previous studies (e.g., Briceno\net al.), I have measured the Initial Mass Function (IMF) for a\nreddening-limited sample in four fields in the Taurus star forming region. This\nIMF is representative of the young populations within these fields for masses\nabove 0.02 Msun. Relative to the similarly derived IMF for the Trapezium\nCluster (Luhman et al.), the IMF for Taurus exhibits a modest deficit of stars\nabove one solar mass (i.e., steeper slope), the same turnover mass (~0.8 Msun),\nand a significant deficit of brown dwarfs. If the IMF in Taurus were the same\nas that in the Trapezium, 12.8+/-1.8 brown dwarfs (>0.02 Msun) are expected in\nthese Taurus fields where only one brown dwarf candidate is found. These\nresults are used to test theories of the IMF.\n", "  We discuss the influence of strong quantum fluctuations on zero-temperature\nphase transitions in a two-dimensional spin-half Heisenberg system. Using a\nhigh-order coupled cluster treatment, we study competition of magnetic bonds\nwith and without frustration. We find that the coupled cluster treatment is\nable to describe the zero-temperature transitions in a qualitatively correct\nway, even if frustration is present and other methods such as quantum Monte\nCarlo fail.\n", "  We apply the microscopic coupled-cluster method (CCM) to the spin-$1\\over2$\n$XXZ$ models on both the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square\nlattice. Based on a systematic approximation scheme of the CCM developed by us\npreviously, we carry out high-order {\\it ab initio} calculations using\ncomputer-algebraic techniques. The ground-state properties of the models are\nobtained with high accuracy as functions of the anisotropy parameter.\nFurthermore, our CCM analysis enables us to study their quantum critical\nbehavior in a systematic and unbiased manner.\n", "  A review is given of our recent application of a systematic microscopic\nformulation of quantum many-body theory, namely the coupled-cluster method\n(CCM), to Hamiltonian $U(1)$ lattice gauge models in the pure gauge sector. It\nis emphasized that our CCM results represent a natural extension or resummation\nof the results from the strong-coupling perturbation theory.\n", "  We illustrate how the systematic inclusion of multi-spin correlations of the\nquantum spin-lattice systems can be efficiently implemented within the\nframework of the coupled-cluster method by examining the ground-state\nproperties of both the square-lattice and the frustrated triangular-lattice\nquantum antiferromagnets. Various physical quantities including the\nground-state energy, the anisotropy susceptibility, and the sublattice\nmagnetisation are calculated and compared with those obtained from such other\nmethods as series expansions and quantum Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  The coupled cluster method (CCM) is a well-known method of quantum many-body\ntheory, and here we present an application of the CCM to the spin-half J_1--J_2\nquantum spin model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbour interactions on the\nlinear chain and the square lattice. We present new results for ground-state\nexpectation values of such quantities as the energy and the sublattice\nmagnetisation. The presence of critical points in the solution of the CCM\nequations, which are associated with phase transitions in the real system, is\ninvestigated. Completely distinct from the investigation of the critical\npoints, we also make a link between the expansion coefficients of the\nground-state wave function in terms of an Ising basis and the CCM ket-state\ncorrelation coefficients. We are thus able to present evidence of the\nbreakdown, at a given value of J_2/J_1, of the Marshall-Peierls sign rule which\nis known to be satisfied at the pure Heisenberg point (J_2 = 0) on any\nbipartite lattice. For the square lattice, our best estimates of the points at\nwhich the sign rule breaks down and at which the phase transition from the\nantiferromagnetic phase to the frustrated phase occurs are, respectively, given\n(to two decimal places) by J_2/J_1 = 0.26 and J_2/J_1 = 0.61.\n", "  The spin-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAF) on the square and triangular\nlattices is studied using the coupled cluster method (CCM) technique of quantum\nmany-body theory. The phase relations between different expansion coefficients\nof the ground-state wave function in an Ising basis for the square lattice HAF\nis exactly known via the Marshall-Peierls sign rule, although no equivalent\nsign rule has yet been obtained for the triangular lattice HAF. Here the CCM is\nused to give accurate estimates for the Ising-expansion coefficients for these\nsystems, and CCM results are noted to be fully consistent with the\nMarshall-Peierls sign rule for the square lattice case. For the triangular\nlattice HAF, a heuristic rule is presented which fits our CCM results for the\nIsing-expansion coefficients of states which correspond to two-body excitations\nwith respect to the reference state. It is also seen that Ising-expansion\ncoefficients which describe localised, $m$-body excitations with respect to the\nreference state are found to be highly converged, and from this result we infer\nthat the nodal surface of the triangular lattice HAF is being accurately\nmodeled. Using these results, we are able to make suggestions regarding\npossible extensions of existing quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the\ntriangular lattice HAF.\n", "  We present new and exact ``sign rules'' for various spin-s anisotropic\nspin-lattice models. It is shown that, after a simple transformation which\nutilizes these sign rules, the ground-state wave function of the transformed\nHamiltonian is positive-definite. Using these results exact statements for\nvarious expectation values of off-diagonal operators are presented, and\ntransitions in the behavior of these expectation values are observed at\nparticular values of the anisotropy. Furthermore, the effects of sign rules in\nvariational calculations and quantum Monte Carlo calculations are considered.\nThey are illustrated by a simple variational treatment of a one-dimensional\nanisotropic spin model.\n"]}
