The entire\ncompound system evolves in discrete time steps by iterating a global evolution\n$U$. We require that this global evolution $U$ be unitary, in accordance with\nquantum theory, and that this global evolution $U$ be causal, in accordance\nwith special relativity. By causal we mean that information can only ever be\ntransmitted at a bounded speed, the speed bound being quite naturally that of\none edge of the underlying graph per iteration of $U$. We show that under these\nconditions the operator $U$ can be implemented locally; i.e. it can be put into\nthe form of a quantum circuit made up with more elementary operators -- each\nacting solely upon neighbouring nodes. We take quantum cellular automata as an\nexample application of this representation theorem: this analysis bridges the\ngap between the axiomatic and the constructive approaches to defining QCA.\nKEYWORDS: Quantum cellular automata, Unitary causal operators, Quantum walks,\nQuantum computation, Axiomatic quantum field theory, Algebraic quantum field\ntheory, Discrete space-time.\n", "  This research describes a three dimensional quantum cellular automaton (QCA)\nwhich can simulate all other 3D QCA. This intrinsically universal QCA belongs\nto the simplest subclass of QCA: Partitioned QCA (PQCA). PQCA are QCA of a\nparticular form, where incoming information is scattered by a fixed unitary U\nbefore being redistributed and rescattered. Our construction is minimal amongst\nPQCA, having block size 2 x 2 x 2 and cell dimension 2. Signals, wires and\ngates emerge in an elegant fashion.\n", "  Highly stratified shear layers are rendered unstable even at high\nstratifications by Holmboe instabilities when the density stratification is\nconcentrated in a small region of the shear layer. These instabilities may\ncause mixing in highly stratified environments. However these instabilities\noccur in limited bands in the parameter space. We perform Generalized Stability\nanalysis of the two dimensional perturbation dynamics of an inviscid Boussinesq\nstratified shear layer and show that Holmboe instabilities at high Richardson\nnumbers can be excited by their adjoints at amplitudes that are orders of\nmagnitude larger than by introducing initially the unstable mode itself. We\nalso determine the optimal growth that is obtained for parameters for which\nthere is no instability. We find that there is potential for large transient\ngrowth regardless of whether the background flow is exponentially stable or not\nand that the characteristic structure of the Holmboe instability asymptotically\nemerges as a persistent quasi-mode for parameter values for which the flow is\nstable.\n", "  For each Drinfeld-Sokolov integrable hierarchy associated to affine Kac-Moody\nalgebra, we obtain a uniform construction of tau function by using\ntau-symmetric Hamiltonian densities, moreover, we represent its Virasoro\nsymmetries as linear/nonlinear actions on the tau function. The relations\nbetween the tau function constructed in this paper and those defined for\nparticular cases of Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies in the literature are\nclarified. We also show that, whenever the affine Kac-Moody algebra is\nsimply-laced or twisted, the tau functions of the Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchy\ncoincide with the solutions of the corresponding Kac-Wakimoto hierarchy from\nthe principal vertex operator realization of the affine algebra.\n", "  We consider games of strategic substitutes and strategic complements on\nnetworks. We introduce two different evolutionary dynamics in order to refine\ntheir multiplicity of equilibria, and we analyse the system through a mean\nfield approach. We find that for the best-shot game, taken as a model for\nsubstitutes, a replicator-like dynamics does not lead to Nash equilibria,\nwhereas it leads to unique equilibria (full cooperation or full defection,\ndepending on the initial condition and the game parameter) for complements,\nrepresented by a coordination game. On the other hand, when the dynamics\nbecomes more cognitively demanding in the form of a best response evolution,\npredictions are always Nash equilibria (at least when individuals are fully\nrational): For the best-shot game we find equilibria with a definite value of\nthe fraction of contributors, whereas for the coordination game symmetric\nequilibria arise only for low or high initial fractions of cooperators. We also\nextend our study by considering complex heterogeneous topologies, and show that\nthe nature of the selected equilibria does not change for the best-shot game.\nHowever for coordination games we reveal an important difference, namely that\non infinitely large scale-free networks cooperation arises for any value of the\nincentive to cooperate.\n", "  We introduce a Lorentz-symmetry violating extended quantum electrodynamics\n(QED) which preserves gauge symmetry. The extended fermionic sector can\nradiatively induce an extended effective action which simultaneously displays\nthe same electromagnetic terms present in the Carroll-Field-Jackiw,\nMyers-Pospelov and Aether actions.\n", "  Entanglement-assisted classical communication and transmission of a quantum\nsystem are the two quantum resources for information processing. Many\ninformation tasks can be performed using either quantum resource. However, this\nequivalence is not always present since entanglement assisted classical\ncommunication is known to sometimes be the better performing resource. Here, we\nshow not only the opposite phenomenon; that there exists tasks for which\ntransmission of a quantum system is a more powerful resource than entanglement\nassisted classical communication, but also that such phenomena can have a\nsurprisingly strong dependence on the dimension of Hilbert space. We introduce\na family of communication complexity problems parametrized by dimension of\nHilbert space and study the performance of each quantum resource. We find that\nfor low dimensions, the two resources perform equally well, whereas for\ndimension seven and above, the equivalence is suddenly broken and transmission\nof a quantum system becomes more powerful than entanglement assisted classical\ncommunication. Moreover, we find that transmission of a quantum system may even\noutperform classical communication assisted by the stronger-than-quantum\ncorrelations obtained from the principle of Macroscopic Locality.\n", "  The phase diagram of the cuprate superconductors continues to pose formidable\nscientific challenges. While these materials are typically viewed as doped Mott\ninsulators, it is well known that they are Fermi liquids at high hole-dopant\nconcentrations. It was recently demonstrated that at moderate doping, in the\npseudogap region of the phase diagram, the charge carriers are also best\ndescribed as Fermi liquid. Nevertheless, the relationship between the two\nFermi-liquid regions and the nature of the strange-metal state at intermediate\ndoping have remained unsolved. Here we show in the case of the model cuprate\nsuperconductor HgBa2CuO4+{\\delta} that the scattering rate measured by the\ncotangent of the Hall angle remains quadratic in temperature across the\npseudogap temperature, upon entering the strange-metal state, and that it is\ndoping-independent below optimal doping. Analysis of the published results for\nother cuprates reveals that this behavior is universal throughout the entire\nphase diagram and points to a pervasive Fermi-liquid transport scattering rate.\nWe argue that these observations can be reconciled with other data upon\nconsidering the possibility that the pseudogap phenomenon signifies the\ncompletion of the gradual, non-uniform localization of one hole per planar CuO2\nunit upon cooling.\n", "  A spin-1 Heisenberg model on trimerized Kagom\\'e lattice is studied by doing\na low-energy bosonic theory in terms of plaquette-triplons defined on its\ntriangular unit-cells. The model has an intra-triangle antiferromagnetic\nexchange interaction, $J$ (set to 1), and two inter-triangle couplings,\n$J^\\prime>0$ (nearest-neighbor) and $J^{\\prime\\prime}$ (next-nearest-neighbor;\nof both signs). The triplon analysis of this model studies the stability of the\ntrimerized singlet (TS) ground state in the $J^\\prime$-$J^{\\prime\\prime}$\nplane. It gives a quantum phase diagram that has two gapless\nantiferromagnetically (AF) ordered phases separated by the spin-gapped TS\nphase. The TS ground state is found to be stable on $J^{\\prime\\prime}=0$ line\n(the nearest-neighbor case), and on both sides of it for $J^{\\prime\\prime}\\neq\n0$, in an extended region bounded by the critical lines of transition to the\ngapless AF phases. The gapless phase in the negative $J^{\\prime\\prime}$ region\nhas a $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ coplanar $120^\\circ$-AF order, with all the\nmoments of equal length and relative angles of $120^\\circ$. The other AF phase,\nin the positive $J^{\\prime\\prime}$ region, is found to exhibit a different\ncoplanar order with ordering wave vector ${\\bf q}=(0,0)$. Here, two magnetic\nmoments in a triangle are of same magnitude, but shorter than the third. While\nthe angle between the two short moments is $120^\\circ-2\\delta$, it is\n$120^\\circ+\\delta$ between a short and the long one. Only when\n$J^{\\prime\\prime}=J^\\prime$, their magnitudes become equal and the\nrelative-angles $120^\\circ$. This ${\\bf q}=(0,0)$ phase has the translational\nsymmetry of the Kagom\\'e lattice with isosceles triangular unit-cells. The\nratio of the intensities of certain Bragg peaks, $I_{(1,0)}/I_{(0,1)} =\n4\\sin^2{(\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\delta)}$, presents an experimental measure of the\ndeviation, $\\delta$, from the $120^\\circ$ order.\n", "  We investigate plane vortices with color structure. The topological charge\nand gauge action of such colorful plane vortices are studied in the continuum\nand on the lattice. These configurations are vacuum to vacuum transitions\nchanging the winding number between the two vacua, leading to a topological\ncharge $Q=-1$ in the continuum. After growing temporal extent of these\nvortices, the lattice topological charge approaches $-1$ and the index theorem\nis fulfilled. We analyze the low lying modes of the overlap Dirac operator in\nthe background of these colorful plane vortices and compare them with those of\nspherical vortices. They show characteristic properties for spontaneous chiral\nsymmetry breaking.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of a large quantum system of $N$ identical bosons in\n3D interacting via a two-body potential of the form $N^{3\\beta-1}\nw(N^\\beta(x-y))$. For fixed $0\\leq \\beta <1/3$ and large $N$, we obtain a norm\napproximation to the many-body evolution in the $N$-particle Hilbert space. The\nleading order behaviour of the dynamics is determined by Hartree theory while\nthe second order is given by Bogoliubov theory.\n", "  Bell inequalities bound the strength of classical correlations between\nobservers measuring on a shared physical system. However, studies of physical\ncorrelations can be considered beyond the standard Bell scenario by networks of\nobservers sharing some configuration of many independent physical systems.\nHere, we show how to construct Bell-type inequalities for correlations arising\nin any tree-structured network i.e. networks without cycles. This is achieved\nby an iteration procedure that in each step allows one to add a branch to the\ntree-structured network and construct a corresponding Bell-type inequality. We\nexplore our inequalities in several examples, in all of which we demonstrate\nstrong violations from quantum theory.\n", "  We consider the nonparametric estimation problem of continuous probability\ndistribution functions. For the integrated mean square error we provide the\nstatistic corresponding to the best invariant estimator proposed by Aggarwal\n(1955) and Ferguson (1967). The table of critical values is computed and a\nnumerical power comparison of the statistic with the traditional Cram\\'{e}r-von\nMises statistic is done for several representative distributions.\n", "  We revisit the holographic construction of (approximately) local bulk\noperators inside an eternal AdS black hole in terms of operators in the\nboundary CFTs. If the bulk operator carries charge, the construction must\ninvolve a qualitatively new object: a Wilson line that stretches between the\ntwo boundaries of the eternal black hole. This operator - more precisely, its\nzero mode - cannot be expressed in terms of the boundary currents and only\nexists in entangled states dual to two-sided geometries, which suggests that it\nis a state-dependent operator. We determine the action of the Wilson line on\nthe relevant subspaces of the total Hilbert space, and show that it behaves as\na local operator from the point of view of either CFT. For the case of three\nbulk dimensions, we give explicit expressions for the charged bulk field and\nthe Wilson line. Furthermore, we show that when acting on the thermofield\ndouble state, the Wilson line may be extracted from a limit of certain standard\nCFT operator expressions. We also comment on the relationship between the\nWilson line and previously discussed mirror operators in the eternal black\nhole.\n", "  We prove the existence of long-range order for the 3-state Potts\nantiferromagnet at low temperature on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ for sufficiently large\n$d$. In particular, we show the existence of six extremal and ergodic\ninfinite-volume Gibbs measures, which exhibit spontaneous magnetization in the\nsense that vertices in one bipartition class have a much higher probability to\nbe in one state than in either of the other two states. This settles the\nhigh-dimensional case of the Koteck\\'y conjecture.\n", "  We propose an analytic model for the normal YORP and diurnal Yarkovsky\neffects experienced by a convex asteroid. Both the YORP torque and the\nYarkovsky force are expressed as integrals of a universal function over the\nsurface of an asteroid. Although in general this function can only be\ncalculated numerically from the solution of the heat conductivity equation,\napproximate solutions can be obtained in quadratures for important limiting\ncases. We consider 3 such simplified models: Rubincam's approximation (zero\nheat conductivity), low thermal inertia limit (including the next order\ncorrection and thus valid for small heat conductivity), and high thermal\ninertia limit (valid for large heat conductivity). All three simplified models\nare compared with the exact solution.\n", "  We use the Millennium simulation to show that halo clustering varies\nsignificantly with cosmic web type. Halos are classified as node, filament,\nsheet and void halos based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the velocity\nshear tensor. The velocity field is sampled by the peculiar velocities of a\nfixed number of neighbouring halos and spatial derivatives are computed using a\nkernel borrowed from smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The classification scheme\nis used to examine the clustering of halos as a function of web type for halos\nwith masses larger than $10^{11}$. We find that node halos show positive bias,\nfilament halos show negligible bias, and void and sheet halos are anti-biased\nindependent of halo mass. Our findings suggest that the mass dependence of halo\nclustering is rooted in the composition of web types as a function of halo\nmass. The substantial fraction of node type halos for halo masses $\\gtrsim\n2\\times10^{13}\\,h^{-1}\\rm M_\\odot$ leads to positive bias. Filament type halos\nprevail at intermediate masses, $10^{12} - 10^{13}\\,h^{-1}\\rm M_\\odot$,\nresulting in unbiased clustering. The large contribution of sheet type halos at\nlow halo masses $\\lesssim 10^{12}\\,h^{-1}\\rm M_\\odot$ generates anti-biasing.\n", "  Based on energy considerations, we derive a class of dynamic outflow boundary\nconditions for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, containing the\nwell-known convective boundary condition but incorporating also the stress at\nthe outlet. As a key building block for the analysis of such problems, we\nconsider the Stokes equations with such dynamic outflow boundary conditions in\na halfspace and prove the existence of a strong solution in the appropriate\nSobolev-Slobodeckij-setting with $L_p$ (in time and space) as the base space\nfor the momentum balance. For non-vanishing stress contribution in the boundary\ncondition, the problem is actually shown to have $L_p$-maximal regularity under\nthe natural compatibility conditions. Aiming at an existence theory for\nproblems in weakly singular domains, where different boundary conditions apply\non different parts of the boundary such that these surfaces meet orthogonally,\nwe also consider the prototype domain of a wedge with opening angle\n$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and different combinations of boundary conditions: Navier-Slip\nwith Dirichlet and Navier-Slip with the dynamic outflow boundary condition.\nAgain, maximal regularity of the problem is obtained in the appropriate\nfunctional analytic setting and with the natural compatibility conditions.\n", "  We study numerically the optical properties of low-buckled silicene and\nAB-stacked bilayer graphene quantum dots subjected to an external electric\nfield, which is normal to their surface. Within the tight-binding model, the\noptical absorption is calculated for quantum dots, of triangular and hexagonal\nshapes, with zigzag and armchair edge terminations. We show that in triangular\nsilicene clusters with zigzag edges a rich and widely tunable infrared\nabsorption peak structure originates from transitions involving zero energy\nstates. The edge of absorption in silicene quantum dots undergoes red shift in\nthe external electric field for triangular clusters, whereas blue shift takes\nplace for hexagonal ones. In small clusters of bilayer graphene with zigzag\nedges the edge of absorption undergoes blue/red shift for triangular/hexagonal\ngeometry. In armchair clusters of silicene blue shift of the absorption edge\ntakes place for both cluster shapes, while red shift is inherent for both\nshapes of the bilayer graphene quantum dots.\n", "  We are concerned with underlying connections between fluids, elasticity,\nisometric embedding of Riemannian manifolds, and the existence of wrinkled\nsolutions of the associated nonlinear partial differential equations. In this\npaper, we develop such connections for the case of two spatial dimensions, and\ndemonstrate that the continuum mechanical equations can be mapped into a\ncorresponding geometric framework and the inherent direct application of the\ntheory of isometric embeddings and the Gauss-Codazzi equations through examples\nfor the Euler equations for fluids and the Euler-Lagrange equations for elastic\nsolids. These results show that the geometric theory provides an avenue for\naddressing the admissibility criteria for nonlinear conservation laws in\ncontinuum mechanics.\n", "  In topological quantum computing, unitary operations on qubits are performed\nby adiabatic braiding of non-Abelian quasiparticles, such as Majorana zero\nmodes, and are protected from local environmental perturbations. In the\nadiabatic regime, with timescales set by the inverse gap of the system, the\nerrors can be made arbitrarily small by performing the process more slowly. To\nenhance the performance of quantum information processing with Majorana zero\nmodes, we apply the theory of optimal control to the diabatic dynamics of\nMajorana-based qubits. While we sacrifice complete topological protection, we\nimpose constraints on the optimal protocol to take advantage of the nonlocal\nnature of topological information and increase the robustness of our gates. By\nusing the Pontryagin's maximum principle, we show that robust equivalent gates\nto perfect adiabatic braiding can be implemented in finite times through\noptimal pulses. In our implementation, modifications to the device Hamiltonian\nare avoided. Focusing on thermally isolated systems, we study the effects of\ncalibration errors and external white and $1/f$ (pink) noise on Majorana-based\ngates. While a noise-induced antiadiabatic behavior, where a slower process\ncreates more diabatic excitations, prohibits indefinite enhancement of the\nrobustness of the adiabatic scheme, our fast optimal protocols exhibit\nremarkable stability to noise and have the potential to significantly enhance\nthe practical performance of Majorana-based information processing.\n", "  We investigate cosmological constraints on the original relaxion scenario\nproposed by Graham, Kaplan and Rajendran. We first discuss the appropriate sign\nchoice of the terms in the scalar potential, when the QCD axion is the relaxion\nwith a relaxion-inflaton coupling proposed in the original paper. We next\nderive the cosmologically consistent ranges of the mass and a coupling of the\nrelaxion for both the QCD relaxion and non-QCD relaxion. The mass range is\nobtained by $10^{-5}$ eV $\\ll m_{\\phi} \\lesssim 10^4$ eV. We also find that a\nstrong correlation between the Hubble parameter at the relaxion stabilization\nand the scale $\\Lambda$ of non-QCD strong dynamics, which generates the\nnon-perturbative relaxion cosine potential. For a higher relaxion mass, a large\nscale $\\Lambda$ becomes available. However, for its lower mass, $\\Lambda$\nshould be small and constructing such a particle physics model is challenging.\n", "  Random quantum processes play a central role both in the study of fundamental\nmixing processes in quantum mechanics related to equilibration, thermalisation\nand fast scrambling by black holes, as well as in quantum process design and\nquantum information theory. In this work, we present a framework describing the\nmixing properties of continuous-time unitary evolutions originating from local\nHamiltonians having time-fluctuating terms, reflecting a Brownian motion on the\nunitary group. The induced stochastic time evolution is shown to converge to a\nunitary design. As a first main result, we present bounds to the mixing time.\nBy developing tools in representation theory, we analytically derive an\nexpression for a local k-th moment operator that is entirely independent of k,\ngiving rise to approximate unitary k-designs and quantum tensor product\nexpanders. As a second main result, we introduce tools for proving bounds on\nthe rate of decoupling from an environment with random quantum processes. By\ntying the mathematical description closely with the more established one of\nrandom quantum circuits, we present a unified picture for analysing local\nrandom quantum and classes of Markovian dissipative processes, for which we\nalso discuss applications.\n", "  The nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NSE) is well-known to model an ideal\nfiber-optic communication channel. Even though the NSE is a nonlinear evolution\nequation, it can be solved analytically using a nonlinear Fourier transform\n(NFT). Recently, there has been much interest in transceiver concepts that\nutilize this NFT and its inverse to (de-)modulate data. Fast algorithms for the\n(inverse) NFT are a key requirement for the simulation and real-time\nimplementation of fiber-optic communication systems based on NFTs. While much\nprogress has already been made for accelerating the forward NFT, less is known\non its inverse. The nonlinear Fourier spectrum comprises a continuous and a\ndiscrete part in general, but so far only fast inverse NFTs for signals whose\ncontinuous spectrum is null have been reported in the literature. In this\npaper, we investigate the complementary case and propose the first fast inverse\nNFT for signals whose discrete spectrum is empty. This is the case required by\ntransmitters in the recently proposed nonlinear inverse synthesis scheme, but\nthe problem also occurs in different application areas such as fiber Bragg\ngrating design. Our algorithms require only $\\mathcal{O}(D\\log^{2}D)$ floating\npoint operations to generate $D$ samples of the desired signal, which is almost\nan order of magnitude faster than the current state of the art,\n$\\mathcal{O}(D^{2})$. This paper also quantifies, apparently for the first\ntime, the impact that truncating a signal in the time-domain has on the NFT.\n", "  A network effect is introduced taking into account competition, cooperation\nand mixed-type interaction amongst agents along a generalized\nVerhulst-Lotka-Volterra model. It is also argued that the presence of a market\ncapacity enforces an indubious limit on the agent's size growth. The state\nstability of triadic agents, i.e., the most basic network plaquette, is\ninvestigated analytically for possible scenarios, through a fixed point\nanalysis. It is discovered that: (i) \\market\" demand is only satisfied for full\ncompetition when one agent monopolizes the market; (ii) growth of agent size is\nencouraged in full cooperation; (iii) collaboration amongst agents to compete\nagainst one single agent may result in the disappearance of this single agent\nout of the market, and (iv) cooperating with two rivals may become a growth\nstrategy for an intelligent agent.\n", "  We are interested in the numerical solution of large systems of hyperbolic\nconservation laws or systems in which the characteristic decomposition is\nexpensive to compute. Solving such equations using finite volumes or\nDiscontinuous Galerkin requires a numerical flux function which solves local\nRiemann problems at cell interfaces. There are various methods to express the\nnumerical flux function. On the one end, there is the robust but very diffusive\nLax-Friedrichs solver; on the other end the upwind Godunov solver which\nrespects all resulting waves. The drawback of the latter method is the costly\ncomputation of the eigensystem.\n  This work presents a family of simple first order Riemann solvers, named\nHLLX$\\omega$, which avoid solving the eigensystem. The new method reproduces\nall waves of the system with less dissipation than other solvers with similar\ninput and effort, such as HLL and FORCE. The family of Riemann solvers can be\nseen as an extension or generalization of the methods introduced by Degond et\nal. \\cite{DegondPeyrardRussoVilledieu1999}. We only require the same number of\ninput values as HLL, namely the globally fastest wave speeds in both\ndirections, or an estimate of the speeds. Thus, the new family of Riemann\nsolvers is particularly efficient for large systems of conservation laws when\nthe spectral decomposition is expensive to compute or no explicit expression\nfor the eigensystem is available.\n", "  We discuss the modified top quark condensation model proposed in\n\\cite{VZ2015}. This construction was inspired by the top - seesaw scenario, in\nwhich the extra heavy fermion $\\chi$ is added that may be paired with the top\nquark. Besides, this model incorporates the ideas of the Little Higgs scenario,\nin which the $125$ GeV scalar particle appears as a Pseudo - Goldstone boson.\nThis model admits (in addition to the $125$ GeV scalar boson $H$) the heavier\nscalar excitation $H^\\prime$. We consider the region of parameters, where its\nmass is $M_{H^\\prime} \\sim 1$ TeV, the width of $H^\\prime$ is\n$\\Gamma_{H^\\prime} \\sim 0.3 M_{H^\\prime}$, while the mass of the heavy fermion\nis $m_\\chi \\sim 1$ TeV. We find that in this model the value of the cross -\nsection $\\sigma_{pp \\to H^\\prime + X \\to \\gamma+\\gamma + X}$ for $\\sqrt{s}=13$\nTeV is essentially smaller than the present experimental upper bound. Besides,\nwe find, that for the chosen values of parameters there should exist the CP -\neven scalar boson with mass $\\approx 2 m_\\chi$ and very small width. In\naddition, the model predicts the existence of the extra neutral CP even scalar\nboson and the charged scalar boson with masses of the order of $1$ TeV.\n", "  Physics and physics education in the United States suffer from severe (and,\nin some cases, worsening) underrepresentation of Black, Latina/o, and Native\npeople of all genders and women of all races and ethnicities. This\nunderrepresentation is a symptom with multiple causes and myriad potential\nsolutions. In this paper, we describe an approach to addressing the causes of\nunderrepresentation through physics students' collective and continued\neducation about racism, sexism, other dimensions of marginalization, as well as\nmodels of allyship and social change. Specifically, we focus on the efforts of\nundergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs who are members of a\nstudent-run diversity-oriented organization in a physics department at a large,\nselective, predominantly white university with high research activity. This\ngroup's education was accomplished through quarterly Diversity Workshops. Here\nwe report on six Diversity Workshops that were co-designed and facilitated by\nthe authors. We describe the context, motivation, and goals of the workshops,\nthe theories underlying their design and implementation, and their content. In\naddition, we discuss workshop attendance and suggest strategies for maintaining\nhigh attendance in the future. Because the details of our workshops were\ntailored to the specific needs and interests of a particular student\norganization, our workshop agendas may not be widely applicable beyond our\nlocal context. Therefore, we share our model, design principles, and\nfacilitation strategies in this paper.\n", "  We compute the in-medium partial decay widths of the bottomonium states to\nopen bottom mesons ($B\\bar B$) using a field theoretical model for composite\nhadrons with quark constituents. These decay widths are calculated by using the\nexplicit constructions for the bottomonium states and the open bottom mesons\n($B$ and $\\bar B$), and, the quark antiquark pair creation term of the free\nDirac Hamiltonian written in terms of the constituent quark field operators.\nThese decay widths in the hadronic medium are calculated as arising from the\nmass modifications of the bottomonium states and the $B$ and $\\bar B$ mesons,\nobtained in a chiral effective model. The decay amplitude in the present model\nis multiplied with a strength parameter for the light quark pair creation,\nwhich is fitted from the observed vacuum partial decay width of the bottomonium\nstate, $\\Upsilon (4S)$ to $B\\bar B$. The effects of the isospin asymmetry, the\nstrangeness fraction of the hadronic matter on the decay widths, arising due to\nthe mass modifications due to these effects, have also been studied. There is\nobserved to be appreciable effects from density, and the effects from isospin\nasymmetry on the parital decay widths of $\\Upsilon \\rightarrow B\\bar B$ are\nobserved to be quite pronounced at high densities. These effects should show up\nin the asymmetric heavy ion collisions in Compressed baryonic matter (CBM)\nexperiments planned at the future facility at FAIR. The study of the $\\Upsilon$\nstates will, however, require access to energies higher than the energy regime\nplanned at the CBM experiment. The density effects on the decay widths of the\nbottomonium states should show up in the production of these states, as well\nas, in dilepton spectra at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) energies.\n", "  Many community detection algorithms have been developed to uncover the\nmesoscopic properties of complex networks. However how good an algorithm is, in\nterms of accuracy and computing time, remains still open. Testing algorithms on\nreal-world network has certain restrictions which made their insights\npotentially biased: the networks are usually small, and the underlying\ncommunities are not defined objectively. In this study, we employ the\nLancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark graph to test eight state-of-the-art\nalgorithms. We quantify the accuracy using complementary measures and\nalgorithms' computing time. Based on simple network properties and the\naforementioned results, we provide guidelines that help to choose the most\nadequate community detection algorithm for a given network. Moreover, these\nrules allow uncovering limitations in the use of specific algorithms given\nmacroscopic network properties. Our contribution is threefold: firstly, we\nprovide actual techniques to determine which is the most suited algorithm in\nmost circumstances based on observable properties of the network under\nconsideration. Secondly, we use the mixing parameter as an easily measurable\nindicator of finding the ranges of reliability of the different algorithms.\nFinally, we study the dependency with network size focusing on both the\nalgorithm's predicting power and the effective computing time.\n", "  In this work, we have calculated the mass spectra and decay properties of\ndimesonic states in the variational scheme. The inter-mesonic interaction\nconsidered as the Hellmann potential and One Pion Exchange potential. The mass\nspectra of the $D\\overline{D^{*}}$, $D^{*}\\overline{D^{*}}$,\n$D\\overline{B^{*}}$, $B^{*}\\overline{D}$, $B\\overline{B^{*}}$,\n$B^{*}\\overline{B^{*}}$ bound states are calculated. The states X(3872),\n$X_{2c}(4013)$, $Z_{b}(10610)/X_{b}$ and $Z_{b}(10650)/X_{b2}$ are compared\nwith $D\\overline{D^{*}}$, $D^{*}\\overline{D^{*}}$, $B\\overline{B^{*}}$ and\n$B^{*}\\overline{B^{*}}$ dimesonic bound states. {\\bf To probe the molecular\nstructure of the compared states, we have calculated the decay properties\nsensitive to their long and short distance structure of the hadronic molecule.\nThe radiative decay for the state X(3872) into $J/\\psi \\gamma$ and $\\psi(2S)\n\\gamma$ have been calculated and the ratio is found to be ten times lesser than\nthe experimental value whereas the other decay modes are comparable with other\ntheoretical and experimental results. This results restrict us to assigned the\npure molecular structure to the X(3872). But, Our results suggests that the\ncompared states are close to the molecular structure or have dominant molecular\ncomponent in their wave function. Apart from these, the other calculated mass\nspectra of dimesonic states are predicted and for such bound states, the\nexperimental search are suggested.}\n", "  The behavior of levels near the threshold of the lower continuum in\nsuperheavy H-like atoms with $Z\\alpha >1$, caused by the interaction $\\Delta\nU_{AMM}$ of the electron's magnetic anomaly (AMM) dynamically screened at small\ndistances $ \\ll 1/m$, with the Coulomb field of atomic nucleus is considered by\ntaking into account the complete dependence of electron's wavefunction (WF) on\n$Z\\alpha$. It is shown that the calculation of the contribution caused by\n$\\Delta U_{AMM}$ via both the quark structure and the whole nucleus, considered\nas a uniformly charged extended Coulomb source, leads to results, which\ncoincide within the accepted precision of calculations. It is shown also that\nthere appears some difference in results between perturbative and\nnon-perturbative methods of accounting for the contribution from $\\Delta\nU_{AMM}$ within the corresponding Dirac equation (DE) in favor of the latter.\nMoreover, the growth rate of the contribution from $\\Delta U_{AMM}$ reaches its\nmaximum at $ Z \\sim 140-150$, while by further increase of $Z$ into the\nsupercritical region $Z\\gg Z_{cr,1}$ the shift of levels caused by $\\Delta\nU_{AMM}$ near the lower continuum decreases monotonically to zero. The last\nresult is generalized to the whole self-energy contribution to the shift of\nlevels and so to the possible behavior of radiative QED-effects with virtual\nphoton exchange near the lower continuum.\n", "  This paper discusses some infinite trigonometric products which are\ncharacteristic functions of simple random walks on the real line; in fact,\nthese define \"random Riemann-$\\zeta$ functions,\" a notion which is explained.\nThe concept of typicality for random Riemann $\\zeta$ functions is explained and\nconnected to the Riemann hypothesis. Then it is shown that the distribution\nfunctions of these random walks are Schwarz functions. It is also shown that\ntheir characteristic function factors into the characteristic function of a\nLevy stable random variable and a subdominant fluctuating factor. As a\ncorollary it also follows that amateur mathematician Benoit Cloitre's infinite\ntrigonometric product $\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty\n\\left[\\frac23+\\frac13\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{n^{2}}\\right)\\right] = e^{- C\n\\,\\sqrt{|x|} +\\varepsilon(|x|)},$ with $|\\varepsilon(|x|)| \\leq K |x|^{1/3}$\nfor some $K>0$, and with $ C= \\int\\frac{\\sin\\xi^2}{2+\\cos\\xi^2}{\\rm{d}}\\xi;$\nnumerically, $C = 0.319905585... \\sqrt{\\pi}$. This confirms a surmise of Benoit\nCloitre. The $O\\big(|x|^{1/3}\\big)$ error bound is empirically found to be\naccurate for moderately sized $|x|$ but not for larger $|x|$. This difference\n$\\varepsilon(|x|)$ between Cloitre's $\\log \\prod_{n\\geq1}\\left[\\frac23\n+\\frac13\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{n^{2}}\\right)\\right]$ and its regular trend\n$-C\\sqrt{|x|}$, although deterministic, appears to be an \"empirically\nunpredictable\" function. Our probabilistic investigation of this phenomenon\nconnects the fluctuations to the \"random Riemann-$\\zeta$ function with argument\n2.\"\n", "  We find that an observer with a suitable acceleration relative to the frame\ncomoving whit the cosmic fluid, in the context of the FRW decelerating\nuniverse, measures the same cosmological redshift as the LambdaCDM model. The\nestimated value of this acceleration is beta = 1.4x10^-9m/s^2. The problem of a\ntoo high peculiar velocity can be solved assuming, for the observer, a sort of\nhelical motion.\n", "  We use a first-principles density functional theory approach to calculate the\nshift current and linear absorption of uniformly illuminated single-layer Ge\nand Sn monochalcogenides. We predict strong absorption in the visible spectrum\nand a large effective three-dimensional shift current ($\\sim$100 $\\mu$A/V$^2$),\nlarger than has been previously observed in other polar systems. Moreover, we\nshow that the integral of the shift-current tensor is correlated to the large\nspontaneous effective three-dimensional electric polarization ($\\sim$1.9\nC/m$^2$). Our calculations indicate that the shift current will be largest in\nthe visible spectrum, suggesting that these monochalcogenides may be promising\nfor polar optoelectronic devices. A Rice-Mele tight-binding model is used to\nrationalize the shift-current response for these systems, and its dependence on\npolarization, in general terms with implications for other polar materials\n", "  A security evaluation against the finite-key-size effect was performed for a\ncommercial plug-and-play quantum key distribution (QKD) system. We demonstrate\nthe ability of an eavesdropper to force the system to distill key from a\nsmaller length of sifted-key. We also derive a key-rate equation that is\nspecific for this system. This equation provides bounds above the upper bound\nof secure key under finite-key-size analysis. From this equation and our\nexperimental data, we show that the keys that have been distilled from the\nsmaller sifted-key size fall above our bound. Thus, their security is not\ncovered by finite-key-size analysis. Experimentally, we could consistently\nforce the system to generate the key outside of the bound. We also test\nmanufacturer's software update. Although all the keys after the patch fall\nunder our bound, their security cannot be guaranteed under this analysis. Our\nmethodology can be used for security certification and standardization of QKD\nsystems.\n", "  The force of adhesion of a rotationally symmetric indenter and an elastic\nhalf-space is analyzed analytically and numerically using an extension of the\nmethod of dimensionality reduction (MDR) for superimposed normal/tangential\nadhesive contacts. In particular, the dependency of the critical adhesion force\non the simultaneously applied tangential force is obtained and the relevant\ndimensionless parameters of the problem are identified. The developed method is\napplicable straightforwardly to adhesive contacts of any bodies of revolution.\n", "  A mere hyperbolic law, like the Zipf's law power function, is often\ninadequate to describe rank-size relationships. An alternative theoretical\ndistribution is proposed based on theoretical physics arguments starting from\nthe Yule-Simon distribution. A modeling is proposed leading to a universal\nform. A theoretical suggestion for the \"best (or optimal) distribution\", is\nprovided through an entropy argument. The ranking of areas through the number\nof cities in various countries and some sport competition ranking serves for\nthe present illustrations.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamical properties of\nSchwarzschild-Beltrami-de Sitter black hole introduced by Mu-Lin Yan \\textit{et\nal.} in 2013 by introducing inertial Beltrami coordinates to traditional\nnon-inertial Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric which is the exact static spherical\nsymmetry solution of Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda$. Based on this new metric, we compute entropy on all horizons and we\ngive the entropy bound of the black hole. Hawking temperatures are calculated\nby considering a perturbation to entropy relations due to that the spacetime\ndescribed by this inertial coordinates is no longer a stationary spacetime in\nwhich surface gravity related to Hawking temperature is defined well on killing\nhorizon. We also get the Smarr relations and the first law of thermodynamics.\nWe find that the Schwarzschild-Beltrami-de Sitter black hole seems to have\nsimilar thermodynamical properties to Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole in the\ncomparison between their corresponding thermodynamical quantities, although the\nnew black hole metric is described by inertial coordinates which exclude the\neffects of inertial force.\n", "  Needs to impart appropriate elasticity and high toughness to viscoelastic\npolymer materials are ubiquitous in industries such as concerning automobiles\nand medical devices. One of the major problems to overcome for toughening is\ncatastrophic failure linked to a velocity jump, i.e., a sharp transition in the\nvelocity of crack propagation occurred in a narrow range of the applied load.\nHowever, its physical origin has remained an enigma despite previous studies\nover 35 years. Here, we propose an exactly solvable model that exhibits the\nvelocity jump incorporating linear viscoelasticity with a cutoff length for a\ncontinuum description. With the exact solution, we elucidate the physical\norigin of the velocity jump: it emerges from a dynamic glass transition in the\nvicinity of the propagating crack tip. We further quantify the velocity jump\ntogether with slow- and fast-velocity regimes of crack propagation, which would\nstimulate the development of tough polymer materials.\n", "  We consider collision of two massive particles in the equatorial plane of an\naxially symmetric stationary spacetime that produces two massless particles\nafterwards. It is implied that the horizon is absent but there is a naked\nsingularity or another potential barrier that makes possible the head-on\ncollision. The relationship between the energy in the center of mass frame\n$E_{c.m.}$ and the Killing energy $E$ measured at infinity is analyzed. It\nfollows immediately from the Wald inequalities that unbounded $E$ is possible\nfor unbounded $E_{c.m.}$ only. This can be realized if the spacetime is close\nto the threshold of the horizon formation. Different types of spacetimes (black\nholes, naked singularities, wormholes) correspond to different possible\nrelations between $E_{c.m.}$ and $E$. We develop a general approach that\nenables us to describe the collision process in the frames of the stationary\nobserver and ZAMO (zero angular momentum observer). The escape cone and escape\nfraction are derived. A simple explanation of the existence of the bright spot\nis given. For the particular case of the Kerr metric, our results agree with\nthe previous ones found in M. Patil, T. Harada, K. Nakao, P.S. Joshi, and M.\nKimura, Phys. Rev. D 93, 104015 (2016).\n", "  This is a comment on Economic Letters DOI\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2015.10.015. We show that due to some\nmethodological aspects the main conclusions of the above mentioned paper should\nbe a little bit altered.\n", "  We consider the Diffusive Epidemic Process (DEP), a two-species\nreaction-diffusion process originally proposed to model disease spread within a\npopulation. This model exhibits a phase transition from an active epidemic to\nan absorbing state without sick individuals. Field-theoretic analyses suggest\nthat this transition belongs to the universality class of Directed Percolation\nwith a Conserved quantity (DP-C). However, some exact predictions derived from\nthe symmetries of DP-C seem to be in contradiction with lattice simulations.\nHere we revisit the field theory of both DP-C and DEP. We discuss in detail the\nsymmetries present in the various formulations of both models, some of which\nhad not been identified previously. We then investigate the DP-C model using\nthe derivative expansion of the non-perturbative renormalization group\nformalism. We recover previous results for DP-C near its upper critical\ndimension $d_c=4$, but show how the corresponding fixed point seems to no\nlonger exist below $d \\lesssim 3$. Consequences for the DEP universality class\nare considered.\n", "  Using a one-layer QG model, we study the effect of random monoscale\ntopography on forced beta-plane turbulence. The forcing is a uniform steady\nwind stress that produces both a uniform large-scale zonal flow $U(t)$ and\nsmaller-scale macroturbulence (both standing and transient eddies). The flow\n$U(t)$ is retarded by Ekman drag and by the domain-averaged topographic form\nstress produced by the eddies. The topographic form stress typically balances\nmost of the applied wind stress, while the Ekman drag provides all of the\nenergy dissipation required to balance the wind work. A collection of\nstatistically equilibrated solutions delineates the main flow regimes and the\ndependence of the time-mean $U$ on the problem parameters and the statistical\nproperties of the topography.\n  If $\\beta$ is smaller than the topographic PV gradient then the flow consists\nof stagnant pools attached to pockets of closed geostrophic contours. The\nstagnant dead zones are bordered by jets and the flow through the domain is\nconcentrated into a narrow channel of open geostrophic contours.\n  If $\\beta$ is comparable to, or larger than, the topographic PV gradient then\nall geostrophic contours are open and the flow is uniformly distributed\nthroughout the domain. In this case there is an \"eddy saturation\" regime in\nwhich $U$ is insensitive to changes in the wind stress. We show that eddy\nsaturation requires strong transient eddies that act as PV diffusion. This PV\ndiffusion does not alter the energy of the standing eddies, but it does\nincrease the topographic form stress by enhancing the correlation between\ntopographic slope and the standing-eddy pressure field. Last, using bounds\nbased on the energy and enstrophy we show that as the wind stress increases the\nflow transitions from a regime in which form stress balances the wind stress to\na regime in which the form stress is very small and large transport ensues.\n", "  The first direct detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from black hole (BH)\nmergers, GW150914, GW151226 and LVT151012, give a robust lower limit $\\sim\n70000$ on the number of merged, highly-spinning BHs in our Galaxy. The total\nspin energy is comparable to all the kinetic energy of supernovae that ever\nhappened in our Galaxy. The BHs release the spin energy to relativistic jets by\naccreting matter and magnetic fields from the interstellar medium (ISM). By\nconsidering the distributions of the ISM density, BH mass and velocity, we\ncalculate the luminosity function of the BH jets, and find that they can\npotentially accelerate TeV-PeV cosmic-ray particles in our Galaxy with total\npower $\\sim 10^{37\\pm 3}$ erg s$^{-1}$ as PeVatrons, positron factories and/or\nunidentified TeV gamma-ray sources. Additional $\\sim 300$ BH jet nebulae could\nbe detectable by CTA (Cherenkov Telescope Array). We also argue that the\naccretion from the ISM can evaporate and blow away cold material around the BH,\nwhich has profound implications for some scenarios to predict electromagnetic\ncounterparts to BH mergers.\n", "  Reliable extraction of cosmological information from clustering measurements\nof galaxy surveys requires estimation of the error covariance matrices of\nobservables. The accuracy of covariance matrices is limited by our ability to\ngenerate sufficiently large number of independent mock catalogs that can\ndescribe the physics of galaxy clustering across a wide range of scales.\nFurthermore, galaxy mock catalogs are required to study systematics in galaxy\nsurveys and to test analysis tools. In this investigation, we present a fast\nand accurate approach for generation of mock catalogs for the upcoming galaxy\nsurveys. Our method relies on low-resolution approximate gravity solvers to\nsimulate the large scale dark matter field, which we then populate with halos\naccording to a flexible nonlinear and stochastic bias model. In particular, we\nextend the \\textsc{patchy} code with an efficient particle mesh algorithm to\nsimulate the dark matter field (the \\textsc{FastPM} code), and with a robust\nMCMC method relying on the \\textsc{emcee} code for constraining the parameters\nof the bias model. Using the halos in the BigMultiDark high-resolution $N$-body\nsimulation as a reference catalog, we demonstrate that our technique can model\nthe bivariate probability distribution function (counts-in-cells), power\nspectrum, and bispectrum of halos in the reference catalog. Specifically, we\nshow that the new ingredients permit us to reach percentage accuracy in the\npower spectrum up to $k\\sim 0.4\\; \\,h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ (within 5\\% up to $k\\sim\n0.6\\; \\,h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) with accurate bispectra improving previous results\nbased on Lagrangian perturbation theory.\n", "  The extreme temperatures and energy densities generated by ultra-relativistic\ncollisions between heavy nuclei produce a state of matter with surprising fluid\nproperties. Non-central collisions have angular momentum on the order of\n1000$\\hbar$, and the resulting fluid may have a strong vortical structure that\nmust be understood to properly describe the fluid. It is also of particular\ninterest because the restoration of fundamental symmetries of quantum\nchromodynamics is expected to produce novel physical effects in the presence of\nstrong vorticity. However, no experimental indications of fluid vorticity in\nheavy ion collisions have so far been found. Here we present the first\nmeasurement of an alignment between the angular momentum of a non-central\ncollision and the spin of emitted particles, revealing that the fluid produced\nin heavy ion collisions is by far the most vortical system ever observed. We\nfind that $\\Lambda$ and $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ hyperons show a positive\npolarization of the order of a few percent, consistent with some hydrodynamic\npredictions. A previous measurement that reported a null result at higher\ncollision energies is seen to be consistent with the trend of our new\nobservations, though with larger statistical uncertainties. These data provide\nthe first experimental access to the vortical structure of the \"perfect fluid\"\ncreated in a heavy ion collision. They should prove valuable in the development\nof hydrodynamic models that quantitatively connect observations to the theory\nof the Strong Force. Our results extend the recent discovery of hydrodynamic\nspin alignment to the subatomic realm.\n", "  We construct a contour function for the entanglement entropies in generic\nharmonic lattices. In one spatial dimension, numerical analysis are performed\nby considering harmonic chains with either periodic or Dirichlet boundary\nconditions. In the massless regime and for some configurations where the\nsubsystem is a single interval, the numerical results for the contour function\nare compared to the inverse of the local weight function which multiplies the\nenergy-momentum tensor in the corresponding entanglement hamiltonian, found\nthrough conformal field theory methods, and a good agreement is observed. A\nnumerical analysis of the contour function for the entanglement entropy is\nperformed also in a massless harmonic chain for a subsystem made by two\ndisjoint intervals.\n", "  Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are a practical option for space-based quantum\ncommunications requiring single-photon detection. However, radiation damage to\nAPDs significantly increases their dark count rates and reduces their useful\nlifetimes in orbit. We show that high-power laser annealing of irradiated APDs\nof three different models (Excelitas C30902SH, Excelitas SLiK, and Laser\nComponents SAP500S2) heals the radiation damage and substantially restores low\ndark count rates. Of nine samples, the maximum dark count rate reduction factor\nvaries between 5.3 and 758 when operating at minus 80 degrees Celsius. The\nillumination power to reach these reduction factors ranges from 0.8 to 1.6 W.\nOther photon detection characteristics, such as photon detection efficiency,\ntiming jitter, and afterpulsing probability, remain mostly unaffected. These\nresults herald a promising method to extend the lifetime of a quantum satellite\nequipped with APDs.\n", "  A fundamental question in the study of chemical reactions is how reactions\nproceed at a collision energy close to absolute zero. This question is no\nlonger hypothetical: quantum degenerate gases of atoms and molecules can now be\ncreated at temperatures lower than a few tens of nanoKelvin. In this work we\nconsider the benchmark ultracold reaction between, the most-celebrated\nultracold molecule, KRb and K. For the first time we map out an accurate ab\ninitio ground state potential energy surface of the KRbK complex in full\ndimensionality and report numerically exact quantum-mechanical reaction\ndynamics. The distribution of rotationally resolved rates is shown to be\nPoissonian. An analysis of the hyperspherical adiabatic potential curves\nexplains this statistical character revealing a chaotic distribution for the\nshort-range collision complex that plays a key role in governing the reaction\noutcome. We compare this with a lighter system with a smaller density of states\n(here the LiYbLi trimer) which displays random, and not chaotic, behavior.\n", "  We calculate the instanton partition function of the four-dimensional N=2*\nSU(N) gauge theory in the presence of a generic surface operator, using\nequivariant localization. By analyzing the constraints that arise from\nS-duality, we show that the effective twisted superpotential, which governs the\ninfrared dynamics of the two-dimensional theory on the surface operator,\nsatisfies a modular anomaly equation. Exploiting the localization results, we\nsolve this equation in terms of elliptic and quasi-modular forms which resum\nall non-perturbative corrections. We also show that our results, derived for\nmonodromy defects in the four-dimensional theory, match the effective twisted\nsuperpotential describing the infrared properties of certain two-dimensional\nsigma models coupled either to pure N=2 or to N=2* gauge theories.\n", "  Exploring two-dimensional (2D) materials with magnetic ordering is a focus of\ncurrent research. It remains a challenge to achieve tunable magnetism in a\nmaterial of one-atom-thickness without introducing extrinsic magnetic atoms or\ndefects. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose that tunable\nferromagnetism can be realized in the recently synthesized holey 2D C$_2$N\n($h$2D-C$_2$N) monolayer via purely electron doping that can be readily\nachieved by gating. We show that owing to the prominent van Hove singularity in\nthe band structure, the material exhibits ferromagnetism even at a small doping\nlevel. Remarkably, over a wide doping range of 4$\\times$10$^{13}$/cm$^2$ to\n8$\\times$10$^{13}$/cm$^2$, the system becomes half-metallic, with carriers\nfully spin-polarized. The estimated Curie temperature can be up to 320 K.\nBesides gating, we find that the magnetism can also be effectively tuned by\nlattice strain. Our result identifies $h$2D-C$_2$N as the first material with\nsingle-atom-thickness that can host gate-tunable room-temperature half-metallic\nmagnetism, suggesting it as a promising platform to explore nanoscale magnetism\nand flexible spintronic devices.\n", "  No experimental evidence exists, to date, whether or not the gravitational\nfield must be quantised. Theoretical arguments in favour of quantisation are\ninconclusive. The most straightforward alternative to quantum gravity, a\ncoupling between classical gravity and quantum matter according to the\nsemi-classical Einstein equations, yields a nonlinear modification of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. Here, effects of this so-called Schr\\\"odinger-Newton\nequation are discussed, which allow for technologically feasible experimental\ntests.\n", "  We establish a general connection between ballistic and diffusive transport\nin systems where the ballistic contribution in canonical ensemble vanishes. A\nlower bound on the Green-Kubo diffusion constant is derived in terms of the\ncurvature of the ideal transport coefficient, the Drude weight, with respect to\nthe filling parameter. As an application, we explicitly determine the lower\nbound on the high temperature diffusion constant in the anisotropic spin 1/2\nHeisenberg chain for anisotropy parameters $\\Delta \\geq 1$, thus settling the\nquestion whether the transport is sub-diffusive or not. Addi- tionally, the\nlower bound is shown to saturate the diffusion constant for a certain classical\nintegrable model.\n", "  We employ a recently developed computational many-body technique to study for\nthe first time the half-filled Anderson-Hubbard model at finite temperature and\narbitrary correlation ($U$) and disorder ($V$) strengths. Interestingly, the\nnarrow zero temperature metallic range induced by disorder from the Mott\ninsulator expands with increasing temperature in a manner resembling a quantum\ncritical point. Our study of the resistivity temperature scaling $T^{\\alpha}$\nfor this metal reveals non Fermi liquid characteristics. Moreover, a continuous\ndependence of $\\alpha$ on $U$ and $V$ from linear to nearly quadratic was\nobserved. We argue that these exotic results arise from a systematic change\nwith $U$ and $V$ of the \"effective\" disorder, a combination of quenched\ndisorder and intrinsic localized spins.\n", "  In this work we study the inverse scattering problem for the selfadjoint\nmatrix Schrodinger operator on the half line. We provide the necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the solvability of the inverse scattering problem.\n", "  The RK measurement by LHCb suggests non-standard lepton-universality\nviolation (LUV) to occur in b to s l+ l- decays, with effects in muons rather\nthan electrons. It is intriguing that a number of other measurements of b to s\nl+ l- transitions by LHCb and B-factories are consistent in magnitude and sign\nwith the RK effect, and fit a coherent effective-theory picture. Further\nindications of non-standard LUV are provided by the long-standing discrepancies\nin b to c tau nu transitions via the ratios R(D) and R(D^*). We review in\ndetail the experimental situation and its rich outlook, the theoretical efforts\n-- and their challenges -- towards convincing dynamics beyond the\neffective-theory level, and discuss the many directions of further\ninvestigation that propagate from the current situation.\n", "  We theoretically investigate trapping conditions for ultracold polar\nmolecules in optical lattices, when external magnetic and electric fields are\nsimultaneously applied. Our results are based on an accurate\nelectronic-structure calculation of the polar $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K polar molecule\nin its absolute ground state combined with a calculation of its\nrovibrational-hyperfine motion. We find that an electric field strength of\n$5.26(15)$ kV/cm and an angle of $54.7^\\circ$ between this field and the\npolarization of the optical laser lead to a trapping design for\n$^{23}$Na$^{40}$K molecules where decoherences due laser-intensity fluctuations\nand fluctuations in the direction of its polarization are kept to a minimum.\nOne standard deviation systematic and statistical uncertainties are given in\nparenthesis. Under such conditions pairs of hyperfine-rotational states of\n$v=0$ molecules, used to induce tunable dipole-dipole interactions between\nthem, experience ultrastable, matching trapping forces.\n", "  Measurements of the electroweak production of a $W$ boson in association with\ntwo jets at high dijet invariant mass are performed using $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ and\n$8$ TeV proton-proton collision data produced by the Large Hadron Collider,\ncorresponding respectively to 4.7 and 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity\ncollected by the ATLAS detector. The measurements are sensitive to the\nproduction of a $W$ boson via a triple-gauge-boson vertex and include both the\nfiducial and differential cross sections of the electroweak process.\n", "  Neoclassical transport in the presence of non-axisymmetric magnetic fields\ncauses a toroidal torque known as neoclassical toroidal viscosity (NTV). The\ntoroidal symmetry of ITER will be broken by the finite number of toroidal field\ncoils and by test blanket modules (TBMs). The addition of ferritic inserts\n(FIs) will decrease the magnitude of the toroidal field ripple. 3D magnetic\nequilibria with toroidal field ripple and ferromagnetic structures are\ncalculated for an ITER steady-state scenario using the Variational Moments\nEquilibrium Code (VMEC). Neoclassical transport quantities in the presence of\nthese error fields are calculated using the Stellarator Fokker-Planck Iterative\nNeoclassical Conservative Solver (SFINCS). These calculations fully account for\n$E_r$, flux surface shaping, multiple species, magnitude of ripple, and\ncollisionality rather than applying approximate analytic NTV formulae. As NTV\nis a complicated nonlinear function of $E_r$, we study its behavior over a\nplausible range of $E_r$. We estimate the toroidal flow, and hence $E_r$, using\na semi-analytic turbulent intrinsic rotation model and NUBEAM calculations of\nneutral beam torque. The NTV from the $\\rvert n \\rvert = 18$ ripple dominates\nthat from lower $n$ perturbations of the TBMs. With the inclusion of FIs, the\nmagnitude of NTV torque is reduced by about 75% near the edge. We present\ncomparisons of several models of tangential magnetic drifts, finding\nappreciable differences only for superbanana-plateau transport at small $E_r$.\nWe find the scaling of calculated NTV torque with ripple magnitude to indicate\nthat ripple-trapping may be a significant mechanism for NTV in ITER. The\ncomputed NTV torque without ferritic components is comparable in magnitude to\nthe NBI and intrinsic turbulent torques and will likely damp rotation, but the\nNTV torque is significantly reduced by the planned ferritic inserts.\n", "  We study chemical-potential dependence of confinement and mass gap in QCD\nwith adjoint fermions in spacetime with one spatial compact direction. By\ncalculating the one-loop effective potential for the Wilson line in the\npresence of chemical potential, we show that a center-symmetric phase and a\ncenter-broken phase alternate when the chemical potential in unit of the\ncompactification scale is increased. In the center-symmetric phase we use\nsemiclassical methods to show that photons in the magnetic bion plasma acquire\na mass gap that grows with the chemical potential as a result of anisotropic\ninteractions between monopole-instantons. For the neutral fermionic sector\nwhich remains gapless perturbatively, there are two possibilities at\nnon-perturbative level. Either to remain gapless (unbroken global symmetry), or\nto undergo a novel superfluid transition through a four-fermion interaction\n(broken global symmetry). If the latter is the case, this leads to an energy\ngap of quarks proportional to a new nonperturbative scale $L^{-1}\\exp[-1/(g^4\n\\mu L)]$, where $L$ denotes the circumference of $S^1$, the low-energy is\ndescribed as a Nambu-Goldstone mode associated with the baryon number, and\nthere exists a new type of BEC-BCS crossover of the diquark pairing as a\nfunction of the compactification scale at small chemical potential.\n", "  We invoke a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to jointly analyse two traditional\nemission-line classification schemes of galaxy ionization sources: the\nBaldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) and $\\rm W_{H\\alpha}$ vs. [NII]/H$\\alpha$\n(WHAN) diagrams, using spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nData Release 7 and SEAGal/STARLIGHT datasets. We apply a GMM to empirically\ndefine classes of galaxies in a three-dimensional space spanned by the $\\log$\n[OIII]/H$\\beta$, $\\log$ [NII]/H$\\alpha$, and $\\log$ EW(H${\\alpha}$), optical\nparameters. The best-fit GMM based on several statistical criteria suggests a\nsolution around four Gaussian components (GCs), which are capable to explain up\nto 97 per cent of the data variance. Using elements of information theory, we\ncompare each GC to their respective astronomical counterpart. GC1 and GC4 are\nassociated with star-forming galaxies, suggesting the need to define a new\nstarburst subgroup. GC2 is associated with BPT's Active Galaxy Nuclei (AGN)\nclass and WHAN's weak AGN class. GC3 is associated with BPT's composite class\nand WHAN's strong AGN class. Conversely, there is no statistical evidence --\nbased on four GCs -- for the existence of a Seyfert/LINER dichotomy in our\nsample. Notwithstanding, the inclusion of an additional GC5 unravels it. The\nGC5 appears associated to the LINER and Passive galaxies on the BPT and WHAN\ndiagrams respectively. Subtleties aside, we demonstrate the potential of our\nmethodology to recover/unravel different objects inside the wilderness of\nastronomical datasets, without lacking the ability to convey physically\ninterpretable results. The probabilistic classifications from the GMM analysis\nare publicly available within the COINtoolbox\n(https://cointoolbox.github.io/GMM\\_Catalogue/).\n", "  Chiral symmetry is always broken in cold, dense matter, by chiral\ncondensation at low densities and by diquark condensation at high density. We\nconstruct here, within a schematic Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, the\ncorresponding generalized Nambu-Goldstone pion, $\\pi_G$. As we show, the\n$\\pi_G$ mode naturally emerges as a linear combination of the $\\langle\n\\bar{q}q\\rangle$ vacuum pion $\\pi$ and the $\\langle qq \\rangle$ diquark\ncondensate pion $\\tilde{\\pi}$, with $q$ the quark field, and continuously\nevolves with increasing density from being $\\pi$-like in the vacuum to\n$\\tilde{\\pi}$-like in the high density diquark pairing phase. We calculate the\ndensity-dependent mass, decay constant, and coupling to quarks of the $\\pi_G$,\nand derive a generalized Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner (GMOR) relation in the\npresence of a finite bare quark mass $m_q$. We briefly discuss the implications\nof the results to possible Bose condensation of $\\pi_G$ in more realistic\nmodels.\n", "  We present a simplified density functional theory (DFT) method to com- pute\nvertical electron and hole attachment energies to frontier orbitals of\nmolecules absorbed on insulating films supported by a metal substrate. The\nadsorbate and the film is treated fully within DFT, whereas the metal is\ntreated implicitly by a perfect conductor model. As illustrated for a pentacene\nmolecule adsorbed on NaCl films sup- ported by a Cu substrate, we find that the\ncomputed energy gap between the highest and lowest occupied molecular orbitals\n- HOMO and LUMO -from the vertical attach- ment energies increases with the\nthickness of the insulating film, in agreement with experiments. This increase\nof the gap can be rationalized in a simple dielectric model with parameters\ndetermined from DFT calculations and is found to be dominated by the image\ninteraction with the metal. However, this model overestimates the down- ward\nshift of the energy gap in the limit of an infinitely thick film. This work\nprovides a new and efficient strategy to extend the use of density functional\ntheory to the study of charging and discharging of large molecular absorbates\non insulating films supported by a metal substrate.\n", "  We investigate the effect on disorder potential on exciton valley\npolarization and valley coherence in monolayer WSe2. By analyzing polarization\nproperties of photoluminescence, the valley coherence (VC) and valley\npolarization (VP) is quantified across the inhomogeneously broadened exciton\nresonance. We find that disorder plays a critical role in the exciton VC, while\nminimally affecting VP. For different monolayer samples with disorder\ncharacterized by their Stokes Shift (SS), VC decreases in samples with higher\nSS while VP again remains unchanged. These two methods consistently demonstrate\nthat VC as defined by the degree of linearly polarized photoluminescence is\nmore sensitive to disorder potential, motivating further theoretical studies.\n", "  Attributed graphs model real networks by enriching their nodes with\nattributes accounting for properties. Several techniques have been proposed for\npartitioning these graphs into clusters that are homogeneous with respect to\nboth semantic attributes and to the structure of the graph. However, time and\nspace complexities of state of the art algorithms limit their scalability to\nmedium-sized graphs. We propose SToC (for Semantic-Topological Clustering), a\nfast and scalable algorithm for partitioning large attributed graphs. The\napproach is robust, being compatible both with categorical and with\nquantitative attributes, and it is tailorable, allowing the user to weight the\nsemantic and topological components. Further, the approach does not require the\nuser to guess in advance the number of clusters. SToC relies on well known\napproximation techniques such as bottom-k sketches, traditional graph-theoretic\nconcepts, and a new perspective on the composition of heterogeneous distance\nmeasures. Experimental results demonstrate its ability to efficiently compute\nhigh-quality partitions of large scale attributed graphs.\n", "  The small quark mixing, described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)\nmatrix in the Standard Model, may be a clue to reveal new physics around the\nTeV scale. We consider a simple scenario that extra particles in a hidden\nsector radiatively mediate the flavor violation to the quark sector around the\nTeV scale and effectively realize the observed CKM matrix. The lightest\nparticle in the hidden sector, whose contribution to the CKM matrix is expected\nto be dominant, is a good dark matter (DM) candidate, so we focus on the\ncontribution, and discuss the DM physics. In this scenario, there is an\nexplicit relation between the CKM matrix and flavor violating couplings, such\nas four-quark couplings, because both are radiatively induced by the particles\nin the hidden sector. Then, we can explicitly find the DM mass region and the\nsize of Yukawa couplings between the DM and quarks, based on the study of\nflavor physics and DM physics. In conclusion, we show that DM mass in our\nscenario is around the TeV scale, and the Yukawa couplings are between ${\\cal\nO}(0.01)$ and ${\\cal O}(1)$. The spin-independent DM scattering cross section\nis estimated as ${\\cal O}(10^{-9})$ [pb]. An extra colored particle is also\npredicted at the ${\\cal O}(10)$ TeV scale.\n", "  A high-speed 100 MHz strain monitor using a fiber Bragg grating, an optical\nfilter, and a mode-locked optical fiber laser has been devised, which has a\nresolution of $\\Delta L/L\\sim10^{-4}$. The strain monitor is sufficiently fast\nand robust for the magnetostriction measurements of magnetic materials under\nultrahigh magnetic fields generated with destructive pulse magnets, where the\nsweep rate is in the range of 10-100 T/$\\mu$s. As a working example, the\nmagnetostriction of LaCoO$_{3}$ was measured at room temperature, 115 K, and\n7$\\sim$4.2 K up to a maximum magnetic field of 150 T. The smooth $B^{2}$\ndependence and the first-order transition were observed at 115 K and 7$\\sim$4.2\nK, respectively, reflecting the field-induced spin-state evolution.\n", "  The lorentzian CR-structure (LCR-structure) is a special 4-dimensional\ntotally real CR-structure, which contains two correlated 3-dimensional\nCR-structures. It is defined by explicit Cartan relations and characterized by\nthe \"left\" and \"right\" CP3 points with two spinors and two Newman complex\ntrajectories. Using a gauge field action, which depends on this LCR-structure\nand not the metric, a 4-dimensional pseudo-conformal field theory (PCFT) is\nformulated. It is invariant under the two Cartan infinite dimensional Lie\nalgebras of the contained 3-dimensional CR-structures, in complete analogy to\nthe 2-dimensional CFT. These algebras do not assume central charges. \"Open\" and\n\"closed\" LCR-manifolds are defined in analogy to the 2-dimensional string\ntheory. The states and transition amplitudes of the PCFT model are defined\nusing the path-integral formalism as functional integrations over the\nLCR-structures, where a summation over the structure relative invariants has to\nbe considered in addition to the ordinary summation over the topological\ninvariants of the LCR-manifolds. The gauge field propagator in the sector of\nthe \"open\" degenerate LCR-structure is computed and found to be confining.\nUsing the Elie Cartan list of automorphisms of the 3-dimensinal CR-structures,\nthe automorphisms of the LCR-structures are investigated. The Poincar\\'e group\nis an automorphism of the degenerate LCR-structure which is considered as the\nvacuum. The \"left\" and \"right\" spinors of the vacuum LCR-structure transform\nunder the corresponding non-equivalent conjugate representations of the Lorentz\ngroup. The electron-positron with electromagnetic and gravitational radiations\nis identified as the Kerr-Newman LCR-manifold and the general phenomenological\nframework is outlined.\n", "  A variety of tasks in quantum control, ranging from purification and cooling,\nto quantum stabilization and open-system simulation, rely on the ability to\nimplement a target quantum channel over a specified time interval within\nprescribed accuracy. This can be achieved by engineering a suitable unitary\ndynamics of the system of interest along with its environment -- which,\ndepending on the available level of control, is fully or partly exploited as a\ncoherent quantum controller. After formalizing a controllability framework for\ncompletely positive trace-preserving quantum dynamics, we provide sufficient\nconditions on the environment state and dimension that allow for the\nrealization of relevant classes of quantum channels -- including extreme\nchannels, stochastic unitaries, or simply any channel. The results hinge on\ngeneralizations of Stinespring's dilation via a subsystem principle. In the\nprocess, we show that a conjecture by Lloyd on the minimal dimension of the\nenvironment required for arbitrary open-system simulation, albeit formally\ndisproved, can in fact be salvaged -- provided that classical randomization is\nincluded among the available resources. Existing measurement-based feedback\nprotocols for universal simulation, dynamical decoupling, and dissipative state\npreparation are recast within the proposed coherent framework as concrete\napplications, and the resources they employ discussed in the light of the\ngeneral results.\n", "  We examine the running vacuum model with $\\Lambda (H) = 3 \\nu H^2 +\n\\Lambda_0$, where $\\nu$ is the model parameter and $\\Lambda_0$ is the\ncosmological constant. From the data of the cosmic microwave background\nradiation, weak lensing and baryon acoustic oscillation along with the time\ndependent Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and weighted linear growth $f (z)\\sigma_8(z)$\nmeasurements, we find that $\\nu=(1.37^{+0.72}_{-0.95})\\times 10^{-4}$ with the\nbest fitted $\\chi^2$ value slightly smaller than that in the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel.\n", "  Rippling is an inherent quality of two-dimensional materials playing an\nimportant role in determining their properties. Here, we study the effect of\nstructural corrugations on the electronic and transport properties of monolayer\nblack phosphorus (phosphorene) in the presence of tilted magnetic field. We\nfollow a perturbative approach to obtain analytical corrections to the spectrum\nof Landau levels induced by a long-wavelength corrugation potential. We show\nthat surface corrugations have a non-negligible effect on the electronic\nspectrum of phosphorene in tilted magnetic field. Particularly, the Landau\nlevels are shown to exhibit deviations from the linear field dependence. The\nobserved effect become especially pronounced at large tilt angles and\ncorrugation amplitudes. Magnetotransport properties are further examined in the\nlow temperature regime taking into account impurity scattering. We calculate\nmagnetic field dependence of the longitudinal and Hall resistivities and find\nthat the nonlinear effects reflecting the corrugation might be observed even in\nmoderate fields (\\mbox{$B<10$ T}).\n", "  We show how compensated antiferromagnetic spins can be implemented in the\nmicromagnetic simulation program MuMax3. We demonstrate that we can model spin\nflop coupling as a uniaxial anisotropy for small canting angles and how we can\ntake into account the exact energy terms for strong coupling between a\nferromagnet and compensated antiferromagnet. We also investigate the training\neffect in biaxial antiferromagnets and reproduce the training effect in a\npolycrystalline IrMn/CoFe bilayer.\n", "  We report muon-spin rotation and neutron-scattering experiments on\nnon-magnetic Zn impurity effects on the static spin-stripe order and\nsuperconductivity of the La214 cuprates. Remarkably, it was found that, for\nsamples with hole doping x = 1/8, the spin-stripe ordering temperature T_so\ndecreases linearly with Zn doping y and disappears at around y = 4\\%,\ndemonstrating a high sensitivity of static spin-stripe order to impurities\nwithin a CuO_2 plane. Moreover, T_so is suppressed by Zn in the same manner as\nis the superconducting transition temperature T_c for samples near optimal hole\ndoping. This surprisingly similar sensitivity suggests that the spin-stripe\norder is dependent on intertwining with superconducting correlations.\n", "  We demonstrate the experimental feasibility of a Trojan-horse attack that\nremains nearly invisible to the single-photon detectors employed in practical\nquantum key distribution (QKD) systems, such as Clavis2 from ID Quantique. We\nperform a detailed numerical comparison of the attack performance against\nScarani-Acin-Ribordy-Gisin (SARG04) QKD protocol at 1924nm versus that at\n1536nm. The attack strategy was proposed earlier but found to be unsuccessful\nat the latter wavelength, as reported in N.~Jain et al., New J. Phys. 16,\n123030 (2014). However at 1924nm, we show experimentally that the noise\nresponse of the detectors to bright pulses is greatly reduced, and show by\nmodeling that the same attack will succeed. The invisible nature of the attack\nposes a threat to the security of practical QKD if proper countermeasures are\nnot adopted.\n", "  We report the first observation of a baryonic $B_s^0$ decay, $B_s^0 \\to p\n\\kern 0.1em\\overline{\\kern -0.1em\\Lambda} K^-$, using proton-proton collision\ndata recorded by the LHCb experiment at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV,\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3.0\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The\nbranching fraction is measured to be $ \\mathcal{B}(B_s^0 \\to p \\kern\n0.1em\\overline{\\kern -0.1em\\Lambda} K^-) + \\mathcal{B}(B_s^0 \\to \\bar{p}\n\\Lambda K^+) = \\left[5.46 \\pm 0.61 \\pm 0.57 \\pm 0.50 (\\mathcal{B}) \\pm 0.32\n(f_s/f_d)\\right]\\times 10^{-6}, $ where the first uncertainty is statistical\nand the second systematic, the third uncertainty accounts for the experimental\nuncertainty on the branching fraction of the $B^0 \\to p \\kern\n0.1em\\overline{\\kern -0.1em\\Lambda} \\pi^-$ decay used for normalization, and\nthe fourth uncertainty relates to the knowledge of the ratio of $b$-quark\nhadronization probabilities $f_s/f_d$.\n", "  The decays of $B_s^0$ and $\\overline{B}_s^0$ mesons into the $J/\\psi K^+K^-$\nfinal state are studied in the $K^+K^-$ mass region above the $\\phi(1020)$\nmeson in order to determine the resonant substructure and measure the\n$CP$-violating phase, $\\phi_s$, the decay width, $\\Gamma_s$, and the width\ndifference between light and heavy mass eigenstates, $\\Delta\\Gamma_s$. A\ndecay-time dependent amplitude analysis is employed. The data sample\ncorresponds to an integrated luminosity of $3{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ produced in 7 and 8\nTev $pp$ collisions at the LHC, collected by the LHCb experiment. The\nmeasurement determines $\\phi_s = 119\\pm107\\pm34 {\\rm \\, mrad}$. A combination\nwith previous LHCb measurements using similar decays into the $J/\\psi\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $J/\\psi\\phi(1020)$ final states gives $\\phi_s=1\\pm37 {\\rm\n\\,mrad}$, consistent with the Standard Model prediction.\n", "  There are at least two formation scenarios consistent with the first\ngravitational-wave observations of binary black hole mergers. In field models,\nblack hole binaries are formed from stellar binaries that may undergo common\nenvelope evolution. In dynamic models, black hole binaries are formed through\ncapture events in globular clusters. Both classes of models are subject to\nsignificant theoretical uncertainties. Nonetheless, the conventional wisdom\nholds that the distribution of spin orientations of dynamically merging black\nholes is nearly isotropic while field-model black holes prefer to spin in\nalignment with the orbital angular momentum. We present a framework in which\nobservations of black hole mergers can be used to measure ensemble properties\nof black hole spin such as the typical black hole spin misalignment. We show\nhow to obtain constraints on population hyperparameters using minimal\nassumptions so that the results are not strongly dependent on the uncertain\nphysics of formation models. These data-driven constraints will facilitate\ntests of theoretical models and help determine the formation history of binary\nblack holes using information encoded in their observed spins. We demonstrate\nthat the ensemble properties of binary detections can be used to search for and\ncharacterize the properties of two distinct populations of black hole mergers.\n", "  We develop a Maximum Likelihood estimator (MLE) to measure the masses of\ngalaxy clusters through the impact of gravitational lensing on the temperature\nand polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We show\nthat, at low noise levels in temperature, this optimal estimator outperforms\nthe standard quadratic estimator by a factor of two. For polarization, we show\nthat the Stokes Q/U maps can be used instead of the traditional E- and B-mode\nmaps without losing information. We test and quantify the bias in the recovered\nlensing mass for a comprehensive list of potential systematic errors. Using\nrealistic simulations, we examine the cluster mass uncertainties from\nCMB-cluster lensing as a function of an experiment's beam size and noise level.\nWe predict the cluster mass uncertainties will be 3 - 6% for SPT-3G, AdvACT,\nand Simons Array experiments with 10,000 clusters and less than 1% for the\nCMB-S4 experiment with a sample containing 100,000 clusters. The mass\nconstraints from CMB polarization are very sensitive to the experimental beam\nsize and map noise level: for a factor of three reduction in either the beam\nsize or noise level, the lensing signal-to-noise improves by roughly a factor\nof two.\n", "  Starting from the quantum stochastic differential equations of Hudson and\nParthasarathy (Comm. Math. Phys. 93, 301 (1984)) and exploiting the\nWiener-Ito-Segal isomorphism between the Boson Fock reservoir space\n$\\Gamma(L^2(\\mathbb{R}_+)\\otimes (\\mathbb{C}^{n}\\oplus \\mathbb{C}^{n}))$ and\nthe Hilbert space $L^2(\\mu)$, where $\\mu$ is the Wiener probability measure of\na complex $n$-dimensional vector-valued standard Brownian motion\n$\\{\\mathbf{B}(t), t\\geq 0\\}$, we derive a non-linear stochastic Schrodinger\nequation describing a classical diffusion of states of a quantum system, driven\nby the Brownian motion $\\mathbf{B}$. Changing this Brownian motion by an\nappropriate Girsanov transformation, we arrive at the Gisin-Percival state\ndiffusion equation (J. Phys. A, 167, 315 (1992)). This approach also yields an\nexplicit solution of the Gisin-Percival equation, in terms of the\nHudson-Parthasarathy unitary process and a radomized Weyl displacement process.\nIrreversible dynamics of system density operators described by the well-known\nGorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation is unraveled by\ncoarse-graining over the Gisin-Percival quantum state trajectories.\n", "  We study the problem of injecting single electrons into interacting\none-dimensional quantum systems, a fundamental building block for electron\nquantum optics. It is well known that such injection leads to charge and energy\nfractionalization. We elucidate this concept by calculating the nonequilibrium\nelectron distribution function in the momentum and energy domains after the\ninjection of an energy-resolved electron. Our results shed light on how\nfractionalization occurs via the creation of particle-hole pairs by the\ninjected electron. In particular, we focus on systems with a pair of\ncounterpropagating channels, and we fully analyze the properties of each chiral\nfractional excitation which is created by the injection. We suggest possible\nroutes to access their energy and momentum distribution functions in\ntopological quantum Hall or quantum spin-Hall edge states.\n", "  Semiconductor nanowires provide an ideal platform for various low-dimensional\nquantum devices. In particular, topological phases of matter hosting\nnon-Abelian quasi-particles can emerge when a semiconductor nanowire with\nstrong spin-orbit coupling is brought in contact with a superconductor. To\nfully exploit the potential of non-Abelian anyons for topological quantum\ncomputing, they need to be exchanged in a well-controlled braiding operation.\nEssential hardware for braiding is a network of single-crystalline nanowires\ncoupled to superconducting islands. Here, we demonstrate a technique for\ngeneric bottom-up synthesis of complex quantum devices with a special focus on\nnanowire networks having a predefined number of superconducting islands.\nStructural analysis confirms the high crystalline quality of the nanowire\njunctions, as well as an epitaxial superconductor-semiconductor interface.\nQuantum transport measurements of nanowire \"hashtags\" reveal Aharonov-Bohm and\nweak-antilocalization effects, indicating a phase coherent system with strong\nspin-orbit coupling. In addition, a proximity-induced hard superconducting gap\nis demonstrated in these hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires,\nhighlighting the successful materials development necessary for a first\nbraiding experiment. Our approach opens new avenues for the realization of\nepitaxial 3-dimensional quantum device architectures.\n", "  What is the dynamics of heavy quarks and antiquarks in a quark gluon plasma?\nCan heavy-quark bound states dissociate? Can they (re)combine? These questions\nare addressed by investigating a Lindblad equation that describes the quantum\ndynamics of the heavy quarks in a medium. The Lindblad equations for a heavy\nquark and a heavy quark-antiquark pair are derived from the gauge theory,\nfollowing a chain of well-defined approximations. In this work the case of an\nabelian plasma has been considered, but the extension to the non-abelian case\nis feasible. A one-dimensional simulation of the Lindblad equation is performed\nto extract information about bound-state dissociation, recombination and\nquantum decoherence for a heavy quark-antiquark pair. All these phenomena are\nfound to depend strongly on the imaginary part of the inter-quark potential.\n", "  A unified field theory of all known basic forces and elementary particles is\nbuilt based on the postulates of gauge invariance and coordinate independence\nalong with general conformal scaling symmetry. The hyper-spin charge of a\nunified hyper-spinor field is conjectured to correlate with the dimension of\nhyper-spacetime. The minimal dimension of hyper-spacetime for the unity of\nquarks and leptons in the standard model is found to be $D_h=19$ with a\nbimaximal symmetry. A unified fundamental interaction is governed by hyper-spin\ngauge symmetry SP(1,$D_h$-1). We show gravitational origin of gauge symmetry\ncharacterized by gauge-type Goldstone-like hyper-gravifield, which enables us\nto study gauge gravity and gravity geometry correspondences and to reveal gauge\ngeometry duality.\n", "  We use an empirical tight-binding approach to calculate electron and hole\nstates in [111]-grown PbSe nanowires. We show that the valley-orbit and\nspin-orbit splittings are very sensitive to the atomic arrangement within the\nnanowire elementary cell and differ for [111]-nanowires with microscopic\n$D_{3d}$, $C_{2h}$ and $D_{3}$ symmetries. For the nanowire diameter below 4 nm\nthe valley-orbit splittings become comparable with the confinement energies and\nthe $\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{p}$ method is inapplicable. Nanowires with\nthe $D_{3}$ point symmetry having no inversion center exhibit giant spin\nsplitting $E = \\alpha k_z$, linear in one-dimensional wave vector $k_z$, with\nthe constant $\\alpha$ up to 1 eV$\\cdot$\\AA.\n", "  Comprehensive magnetic-field-temperature ($H$-$T$) phase diagram of solid\noxygen including the $\\theta$ phase is discussed in the context of the\nultrahigh-field measurement and the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) measurement.\nThe problems originating from the short duration of the pulse field,\nnon-equilibrium condition and MCEs, are pointed out and dealt with. The\nobtained phase diagram manifests the entropy relation between the phases as\n$S_\\theta \\sim S_\\alpha<S_\\beta<<S_\\gamma$.\n", "  A search for the production of heavy partners of the top quark with charge\n5/3 (X[5/3]) decaying into a top quark and a W boson is performed with a data\nsample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns,\ncollected in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with\nthe CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Final states with either a pair of same-sign\nleptons or a single lepton, along with jets, are considered. No significant\nexcess is observed in the data above the expected standard model background\ncontribution and an X[5/3] quark with right-handed (left-handed) couplings is\nexcluded at 95% confidence level for masses below 1020 (990) GeV. These are the\nfirst limits based on a combination of the same-sign dilepton and the\nsingle-lepton final states, as well as the most stringent limits on the X[5/3]\nmass to date.\n", "  We study gravitational lensing by a class of zero Ricci scalar wormholes\nwhich arise as solutions in a scalar-tensor theory of gravity. An attempt is\nmade to find a possible link between lensing features, stable/unstable photon\norbits and the energy conditions on the matter required to support these\nspacetimes. Our analysis shows (for this class of wormholes) that light rays\nalways exhibit a positive deflection if the energy conditions are satisfied\n(nonexotic matter content). In contrast, if the energy conditions are violated\n(exotic matter), the net deflection of a light ray may be positive, negative or\neven zero, depending on values of the metric and impact parameters. This\nprompts us to introduce a surface defined by a turning point value at which the\nnet deflection of a light ray is equal to zero, even though we have a curved\nspacetime geometry. We argue that the existence of such a surface may be linked\nto exotic/energy condition violating matter. Wormholes in modified gravity with\nmatter satisfying the energy conditions do not seem to have such a zero\ndeflection surface. Finally, we study strong gravitational lensing briefly and\nalso look into the formation of Einstein and relativistic Einstein rings. We\nconclude with some estimates on the wormhole mass, throat-radius and the\ndetectability of the Einstein rings.\n", "  We present measurements of the low temperature electrical transport\nproperties of the two dimensional carrier gas that forms at the interface of\n$(111)$ (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)/SrTiO$_3$ (LSAT/STO) as\na function of applied back gate voltage, $V_g$. As is found in (111)\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces, the low-field Hall coefficient is\nelectron-like, but shows a sharp reduction in magnitude below $V_g \\sim$ 20 V,\nindicating the presence of hole-like carriers in the system. This same value of\n$V_g$ correlates approximately with the gate voltage below which the\nmagnetoresistance evolves from nonhysteretic to hysteretic behavior at\nmillikelvin temperatures, signaling the onset of magnetic order in the system.\nWe believe our results can provide insight into the mechanism of magnetism in\nSrTiO$_3$ based systems.\n", "  Ferroelectric perovskite oxides possess a large electrocaloric (EC) effect,\nbut usually at high temperatures near the ferroelectric/paraelectric phase\ntransition temperature, which limits their potential application as\nnext-generation solid-state cooling devices. We use classical molecular\ndynamics to study the electric field induced phase transitions and EC effect in\nPMN-PT (PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3-PbTiO3). We find that the maximum EC strength of PMN-PT\noccurs within the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) region at 300 K. The large\nadiabatic temperature change is caused by easy rotation of polarization within\nthe MPB region.\n", "  Electrical resistivity, magnetization and specific heat have been measured\nfor single crystals of SmPt$_{2}$Cd$_{20}$. It has been found that\nSmPt$_{2}$Cd$_{20}$ exhibits a ferromagnetic (FM) transition at $T_{\\rm C} =\n0.64$ K, the lowest among cubic compounds. Specific heat divided by temperature\nincreases with decreasing temperature even below $T_{\\rm C}$ and attains 4.5\nJ/mol K$^{2}$ at 0.26 K, implying substantial magnetic quantum fluctuations. An\nanalysis of the magnetic entropy suggests the crystalline-electric-field\nsplitting of the Sm $J = 5/2$ multiplet with a $\\Gamma_{7}$ doublet ground\nstate and a $\\Gamma_8$ quartet excited state (the excitation energy of $\\sim30$\nK). The electrical resistivity shows a power-law behavior with $T^{0.74}$ below\n2 K without showing any noticeable anomaly at $T_{\\rm C}$. SmPt$_{2}$Cd$_{20}$\nis regarded as a rare cubic system that is located in the vicinity of a FM\nquantum critical point.\n", "  We study a three-dimensional system of self-propelled Brownian particles\ninteracting via the Lennard-Jones potential. Using Brownian Dynamics\nsimulations in an elongated simulation box, we investigate the steady states of\nvapour-liquid phase coexistence of active Lennard-Jones particles with planar\ninterfaces. We measure the normal and tangential components of the pressure\ntensor along the direction perpendicular to the interface and verify mechanical\nequilibrium of the two coexisting phases. In addition, we determine the\nnon-equilibrium interfacial tension by integrating the difference of the normal\nand tangential component of the pressure tensor, and show that the surface\ntension as a function of strength of particle attractions is well-fitted by\nsimple power laws. Finally, we measure the interfacial stiffness using\ncapillary wave theory and the equipartition theorem, and find a simple linear\nrelation between surface tension and interfacial stiffness with a\nproportionality constant characterized by an effective temperature.\n", "  We report the band structures and excitonic properties of delafossites\n$CuMO_2$ (M = Al, Ga, In, Sc, Y, Cr) calculated using the state-of-the-art\n$\\textit{GW}$-BSE approach. We find that all the delafossites are indirect band\ngap semiconductors with large exciton binding energies, varying from 0.24 to\n0.44 eV. The lowest and strongest exciton, mainly contributed from either Cu\n3$\\textit{d}$ $\\rightarrow$ Cu 3$\\textit{p}$ (Al, Ga, In) or Cu 3$\\textit{d}$\n$\\rightarrow$ M 3$\\textit{d}$ (M = Sc, Y, Cr) transitions, is always located at\n$L$ point of the rhombohedral Brillouin zone. Taking the electron-hole effect\ninto account, our theoretical band gaps exhibit nice agreement with\nexperiments.\n", "  We propose a new partially topological theory in three dimensions which\ncouples Chern-Simons theory to matter. The 3-manifolds needed for this\nconstruction admit transverse holomorphic foliation (THF). The theory depends\nonly on the choice of such a structure, but not on a choice of metric and in\nthis sense, it is topological. We argue that this theory arises in topological\nA-model string theory on Lagrangian 3-branes in the presence of additional\nparallel coisotropic 5-branes. The theory obtained in this way is equivalent to\nan N=2 supersymmetric Chern-Simons matter theory on the same 3-manifold, which\nalso only depends on the THF structure. The theory is a realization of a\ntopological theory of class H, which allows splitting of a temporal direction\nfrom spatial directions. We briefly discuss potential condensed matter\napplications.\n", "  Transient beam loading effect is one of the key issues in any superconducting\naccelerators, which needs to be carefully investigated. The core problem in the\nanalysis is to obtain the time evolution of cavity voltage under the transient\nbeam loading. To simplify the problem, the second order ordinary differential\nequation describing the behavior of the cavity voltage is intuitively\nsimplified to a first order one, with the aid of the two critical\napproximations lacking the proof for their validity. In this paper, the\nvalidity is examined mathematically in some specific cases, resulting in a\ncriterion for the simplification. It's popular to solve the approximated\nequation for the cavity voltage numerically, while this paper shows that it can\nalso be solved analytically under the step function approximation for the\ndriven term. With the analytical solution to the cavity voltage, the transient\nreflected power from the cavity and the energy gain of the central particle in\nthe bunch can also be calculated analytically. The validity of the step\nfunction approximation for the driven term is examined by direct evaluations.\nAfter that, the analytical results are compared with the numerical ones.\n", "  Large-$N$, $\\epsilon$-expansion or the conformal bootstrap allow one to make\nsense of some of conformal field theories in non-integer dimension, which\nsuggests that AdS/CFT may also extend to fractional dimensions. It was shown\nrecently that the sphere free energy and the $a$-anomaly coefficient of the\nfree scalar field can be reproduced as a one-loop effect in the dual\nhigher-spin theory in a number of integer dimensions. We extend this result to\nall integer and also to fractional dimensions. Upon changing the boundary\nconditions in the higher-spin theory the sphere free energy of the large-$N$\nWilson-Fisher CFT can also be reproduced from the higher-spin side.\n", "  We demonstrate for the first time an efficient, photonic-based astronomical\nspectrograph on the 8-m Subaru Telescope. An extreme adaptive optics system is\ncombined with pupil apodiziation optics to efficiently inject light directly\ninto a single-mode fiber, which feeds a compact cross-dispersed spectrograph\nbased on array waveguide grating technology. The instrument currently offers a\nthroughput of 5% from sky-to-detector which we outline could easily be upgraded\nto ~13% (assuming a coupling efficiency of 50%). The isolated spectrograph\nthroughput from the single-mode fiber to detector was 42% at 1550 nm. The\ncoupling efficiency into the single-mode fiber was limited by the achievable\nStrehl ratio on a given night. A coupling efficiency of 47% has been achieved\nwith ~60% Strehl ratio on-sky to date. Improvements to the adaptive optics\nsystem will enable 90% Strehl ratio and a coupling of up to 67% eventually.\nThis work demonstrates that the unique combination of advanced technologies\nenables the realization of a compact and highly efficient spectrograph, setting\na precedent for future instrument design on very-large and extremely-large\ntelescopes.\n", "  After the Higgs boson discovery in 2012, the investigation of its properties\nand compatibility with the standard model predictions is central to the physics\nprogram of the LHC experiments. Likewise, the study of the top quark is still\nrelevant at the LHC, more than two decades after its discovery at the Tevatron.\nTop quarks and Higgs bosons are produced at the LHC on a large scale and share\na deep connection based on the large mass of the top quark. Both particles\nprovide an excellent laboratory in which to search for new physics: the\nmeasurement of their properties tests the foundations of the standard model;\nand they feature prominently in a variety of exotic signals. The coupling of\nthe Higgs boson to the top quark, a fundamental standard model parameter, can\nonly be measured directly in processes where the two particles are produced\ntogether. The production of a Higgs boson together with one or two top quarks\nis also sensitive to several exciting new physics effects. A brief overview of\nthe current experimental status of top quark and Higgs boson physics is\npresented using results from the CMS Collaboration.\n", "  Real-time monitoring of individual particles from atmospheric aerosols was\nperformed by means of a specifically developed single-particle fluorescence\nspectrometer (SPFS). The observed fluorescence was assigned to particles\nbearing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). This assignment was supported\nby an intercomparison with classical speciation on filters followed by gas\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. As compared with\ndaily-averaged data, our time resolved approach provided information about the\nphysicochemical dynamics of the particles. In particular, distinctions were\nmade between background emissions related to heating, and traffic peaks during\nrush hours. Also, the evolution of the peak fluorescence wavelength provided an\nindication of the aging of the particles during the day.\n", "  The abundance of glycine (Gly), the simplest amino acid, in meteorites leads\nus to the next question about its extraterrestrial origin. However, astronomers\nhave not yet found glycine signature in interstellar medium. Laboratory\nmicrowave spectroscopy experiments report the most stable Gly conformer has a\ndipole moment of 4.5 - 5.45 Debye. Theoretical calculations, so far performed\nonly with Gaussian basis functions, has predicted a dipole moment of about 1\nDebye. This discrepancy has baffled astronomers. We study the energetics of\nglycine and its isomers and conformers via plane-wave density functional theory\ncalculations. The geometric structures of the isomers and their conformers are\nidentified, along with their relative stability and their dipole moment. In the\ncase of glycine, we obtain the most stable conformer with a dipole moment of\n5.76 Debye, close to the microwave spectroscopy experiments. If the plane wave\nenergy cutoff is reduced to a lower value (~400 eV) on purpose, the energy\nordering reverses to the case with Gaussian basis calculations.\n", "  Recent Planck observations of dust polarization in the Galaxy have revealed\nthat the power in $E$ mode is twice that in $B$ mode. Caldwell et. al. have\nformulated a theoretical model in the context of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nturbulence and found it problematic to account for this result. In particular,\nthey concluded that there is a very narrow range of theoretical parameters that\ncould account for the observation. This poses a problem of whether the accepted\ndescription of MHD turbulence can apply to the interstellar medium. We revisit\nthe problem and demonstrate that MHD turbulence corresponding to the high\ngalactic latitudes range of Alfv\\'en Mach numbers, i.e. $M_A\\lesssim 0.5$, can\nsuccessfully explain the available results for the $E$ to $B$ mode ratio.\n", "  We consider Y-system functional equations of the form $$\nY_n(x+i)Y_n(x-i)=\\prod_{m=1}^N (1+Y_m(x))^{G_{nm}}$$ and the corresponding\nnonlinear integral equations of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. We prove an\nexistence and uniqueness result for solutions of these equations, subject to\nappropriate conditions on the analytical properties of the $Y_n$, in particular\nthe absence of zeros in a strip around the real axis. The matrix $G_{nm}$ must\nhave non-negative real entries, and be irreducible and diagonalisable over\n$\\mathbb{R}$ with spectral radius less than 2. This includes the adjacency\nmatrices of finite Dynkin diagrams, but covers much more as we do not require\n$G_{nm}$ to be integers. Our results specialise to the constant Y-system,\nproving existence and uniqueness of a strictly positive solution in that case.\n", "  We describe a Borel-Pad\\'e re-summation of the $\\beta$-function in the three\nWigner-Dyson symmetry classes. Using this approximate $\\beta$-function we\ndiscuss the dimensional dependence of the critical exponent and compare with\nnumerical estimates. We also estimate the lower critical dimension of the\nsymplectic symmetry class.\n", "  We have developed an efficient Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) selection method\nusing 18-band Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting in mid-infrared\n(mid-IR). AGNs are often obscured by gas and dust, and those obscured AGNs tend\nto be missed in optical, UV and soft X-ray observations. Mid-IR light can help\nus to recover them in an obscuration free way using their thermal emission. On\nthe other hand, Star-Forming Galaxies (SFG) also have strong PAH emission\nfeatures in mid-IR. Hence, establishing an accurate method to separate\npopulations of AGN and SFG is important. However, in previous mid-IR surveys,\nonly 3 or 4 filters were available, and thus the selection was limited. We\ncombined AKARI's continuous 9 mid-IR bands with WISE and Spitzer data to create\n18 mid-IR bands for AGN selection. Among 4682 galaxies in the AKARI NEP deep\nfield, 1388 are selected to be AGN hosts, which implies an AGN fraction of\n29.6$\\pm$0.8$\\%$ (among them 47$\\%$ are Seyfert 1.8 and 2). Comparing the\nresult from SED fitting into WISE and Spitzer colour-colour diagram reveals\nthat Seyferts are often missed by previous studies. Our result has been tested\nby stacking median magnitude for each sample. Using X-ray data from Chandra, we\ncompared the result of our SED fitting with WISE's colour box selection. We\nrecovered more X-ray detected AGN than previous methods by 20$\\%$.\n", "  We look at a graph property called reducibility which is closely related to a\ncondition developed by Brown to evaluate Feynman integrals. We show for graphs\nwith a fixed number of external momenta, that reducibility with respect to both\nSymanzik polynomials is graph minor closed. We also survey the known forbidden\nminors and the known structural results. This gives some structural information\non those Feynman diagrams which are reducible.\n", "  We study electronic and optical properties of single layer phosphorene\nquantum dots with various shapes, sizes, and edge types (including disordered\nedges) subjected to an external electric field normal to the structure plane.\nCompared to graphene quantum dots, in phosphorene clusters of similar shape and\nsize there is a set of edge states with energies dispersed at around the Fermi\nlevel. These states make the majority of phosphorene quantum dots metallic and\nenrich the phosphorene absorption gap with low-energy absorption peaks tunable\nby the electric field. The presence of the edge states dispersed at around the\nFermi level is a characteristic feature that is independent of the edge\nmorphology and roughness.\n", "  The formation of quasi-spherical cages from protein building blocks is a\nremarkable self-assembly process in many natural systems, where a small number\nof elementary building blocks are assembled to build a highly symmetric\nicosahedral cage. In turn, this has inspired synthetic biologists to design de\nnovo protein cages. We use simple models, on multiple scales, to investigate\nthe self-assembly of a spherical cage, focusing on the regularity of the\npacking of protein-like objects on the surface. Using building blocks, which\nare able to pack with icosahedral symmetry, we examine how stable these highly\nsymmetric structures are to perturbations that may arise from the interplay\nbetween flexibility of the interacting blocks and entropic effects. We find\nthat, in the presence of those perturbations, icosahedral packing is not the\nmost stable arrangement for a wide range of parameters; rather disordered\nstructures are found to be the most stable. Our results suggest that (i) many\ndesigned, or even natural, protein cages may not be regular in the presence of\nthose perturbations, and (ii) that optimizing those flexibilities can be a\npossible design strategy to obtain regular synthetic cages with full control\nover their surface properties.\n", "  Many-body localization (MBL) is an emergent phase in correlated quantum\nsystems with promis- ing applications, particularly in quantum information.\nHere, we unveil the existence and analyse this phase in a chiral multiferroic\nmodel system. Conventionally, MBL occurrence is traced via level statistics by\nimplementing a standard finite-size scaling procedure. Here, we present an\napproach based on the full distribution of the ratio of adjacent energy\nspacings. We find a strong broadening of the histograms of counts of these\nlevel spacings directly at the transition point from MBL to the ergodic phase.\nThe broadening signals reliably the transition point without relying on an\naveraging procedure. The fast convergence of the histograms even for relatively\nsmall systems allows moni- toring the MBL dynamics with much less computational\neffort. Numerical results are presented for a chiral spin chain with a\ndynamical Dzyaloshinskii Moriya (DM) interaction, an established model to\ndescribe the spin excitations in a single phase spin-driven multiferroic\nsystem. The multiferroic MBL phase is uncovered and it is shown how to steer it\nvia electric fields.\n", "  A comment on the Letter by E. Aghion, D. Kessler, and E. Barkai, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 118, 260601 (2017). An important criterion on finite kinetic temperature\nof the system of cold atoms is established. It is shown that the kinetic\ntemperature becomes infinite in Fig. 1 of the commented paper in the course of\ntime, i.e. the considered model system becomes asymptotically infinitely hot.\nMoreover, within this model the behavior of the squared width of the spatial\ndistribution of atoms at the half of its maximum is very different from the\nvariance of the particle positions. In particular, in the discussed Fig. 1 the\nformer one increases sub-ballistically in time, while the variance grows\nsuper-ballistically, which corresponds to a heating phase. This leads to a\nprofound ambiguity in definition and classification of anomalous diffusion. All\nin all, the model in the commented paper simply does not fit to experiments\nwith cold atoms.\n", "  We report on the growth and characterization of ultrathin\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ (YBCO) films on MgO (110) substrates, which exhibit\nsuperconducting properties at thicknesses down to 3 nm. YBCO nanowires, with\nthicknesses down to 10 nm and widths down to 65 nm, have been also successfully\nfabricated. The nanowires protected by a Au capping layer show superconducting\nproperties close to the as-grown films, and critical current densities, which\nare only limited by vortex dynamics. The 10 nm thick YBCO nanowires without the\nAu capping present hysteretic current voltage characteristics, characterized by\na voltage switch which drives the nanowires directly from the superconducting\nto the normal state. Such bistability is associated in NbN nanowires to the\npresence of localized normal domains within the superconductor. The presence of\nthe voltage switch, in ultrathin nanostructures characterized by high sheet\nresistance values, though preserving high quality superconducting properties,\nmake our nanowires very attractive devices to engineer single photon detectors.\n", "  We investigate the phase structure of strongly interacting matter and baryon\nnumber fluctuations in the Polyakov loop improved Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL)\nmodel. The calculation shows that both the chiral and deconfinement\ntransitions, as well as their coincidence and separation determine the basic\nQCD phase structure. The contour maps and the three-dimensional diagrams of the\nnet-baryon kurtosis and skewness present well the trace of QCD phase structure.\nComparing with the experimental data, we find that the existence of a critical\nend point (CEP) of chiral transition is crucial to explain the non-monotonic\nenergy dependence and the large deviation from Poisson baseline of net-proton\nkurtosis. In particular, the relation between the chiral and deconfinement\ntransitions in the crossover region is also reflected by the baryon number\nfluctuations. This study shows that the measurements of higher moments of\nmultiplicity distributions of conserved charges are powerful to investigate the\ncriticality and even the chiral and deconfinement transitions in the crossover\nregion.\n", "  Optical waveguides made from periodically poled materials provide high\nconfinement of light and enable the generation of new wavelengths via\nquasi-phase-matching, making them a key platform for nonlinear optics and\nphotonics. However, such devices are not typically employed for high-harmonic\ngeneration. Here, using 200-fs, 10-nJ-level pulses of 4100 nm light at 1 MHz,\nwe generate high harmonics up to the 13th harmonic (315 nm) in a chirped,\nperiodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide. Total conversion\nefficiencies into the visible--ultraviolet region are as high as 10 percent. We\nfind that the output spectrum depends on the waveguide poling period,\nindicating that quasi-phase-matching plays a significant role. In the future,\nsuch periodically poled waveguides may enable compact sources of ultrashort\npulses at high repetition rates and provide new methods of probing the\nelectronic structure of solid-state materials.\n", "  We present empirical formulae that can provide dispersion and average\neffective area of the fundamental mode in hollow-core antiresonant fibers. The\nformulae draw on the structural parameters of the fiber, and allow one to\nobtain the guiding properties over a wide spectral bandwidth, without the need\nfor time consuming numerical simulations. The formulae are validated by\ncomparing their results with those obtained using a finite-element method. We\nalso analyze the effects of changing the number of antiresonant tubes, as well\nas adding nested elements in the antiresonant tubes on the guiding properties.\n", "  Galactic diffuse emission has provided us with evidence for cosmic ray\nacceleration throughout the Galaxy and the background for searches for physics\nbeyond the Standard Model. However, only the very limited measurements of the\ndiffuse flux are available in TeV $\\gamma$ rays. The High Altitude Water\nCherenkov (HAWC) Observatory is well-suited for observing the diffuse emission\nof very high energy with its unbiased, wide field of view (2 sr). Using data\nfrom HAWC, we present techniques for measuring the diffuse flux and show\npreliminary results.\n", "  In this work, we study degradation of clofibric acid (CFA) in aqueous\nsolution using either ionizing radiation from a $^{60}$Co source or a\nnon-thermal plasma produced by discharges in the air above the solution. The\nresults obtained with the two technologies are compared in terms of\neffectiveness of CFA degradation and its by-products. In both cases the CFA\ndegradation follows a quasi-exponential decay in time well modelled by a\nkinetic scheme which considers the competition between CFA and all reaction\nintermediates for the reactive species generated in solution as well as the\namount of the end product formed. A new degradation law is deduced to explain\nthe results. Although the end-product CO$_2$ was detected and the CFA\nconversion found to be very high under the studied conditions, HPLC analysis\nreveals several degradation intermediates still bearing the aromatic ring with\nthe chlorine substituent. The extent of mineralization is rather limited. The\nenergy yield is found to be higher in the gamma radiation experiments.\n", "  Double-diffusive convection in porous media is a common phenomenon in nature,\nand has received considerable attention in a wide variety of engineering\napplications. In this paper, a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann\n(LB) model is developed for simulating double-diffusive convection in porous\nmedia at the representative elementary volume scale. The MRT-LB model is\nconstructed in the framework of the triple-distribution-function approach: the\nvelocity field, the temperature and concentration fields are solved separately\nby three different MRT-LB equations. The present model has two distinctive\nfeatures. First, the equilibrium moments of the temperature and concentration\ndistributions have been modified, which makes the effective thermal diffusivity\nand heat capacity ratio as well as the effective mass diffusivity and porosity\ndecoupled . This feature is very useful in practical applications. Second,\nsource terms have been added into the MRT-LB equations of the temperature and\nconcentration fields so as to recover the macroscopic temperature and\nconcentration equations. Numerical tests demonstrate that the present model can\nserve as an accurate and efficient numerical method for simulating\ndouble-diffusive convection in porous media.\n", "  The MAGIC telescopes are a system of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov\nTelescopes (IACTs) designed to observe very high energy (VHE) gamma rays above\n~50 GeV. However, as IACTs are sensitive to Cherenkov light in the UV/blue and\nuse photo-detectors with a time response well below the ms scale, MAGIC is also\nable to perform simultaneous optical observations. Through an alternative\nsystem installed in the central PMT of MAGIC II camera, the so-called central\npixel, MAGIC is sensitive to short (1ms - 1s) optical pulses. Periodic signals\nfrom the Crab pulsar are regularly monitored. Here we report for the first time\nthe experimental determination of the sensitivity of the central pixel to\nisolated 1-10 ms long optical pulses. The result of this study is relevant for\nsearches of fast transients such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).\n", "  The magnetic, thermodynamic and dielectric properties of the $\\gamma$ -\nFe${_2}$WO${_6}$ system is reported. Crystallizing in the centrosymmetric\n$Pbcn$ space group, this particular polymorph exhibits a number of different\nmagnetic transitions, all of which are seen to exhibit a finite\nmagneto-dielectric coupling. At the lowest measured temperatures, the magnetic\nground state appears to be glass-like, as evidenced by the waiting time\ndependence of the magnetic relaxation. Also reflected in the frequency\ndependent dielectric measurements, these signatures possibly arise as a\nconsequence of the oxygen non-stoichiometry, which promotes an inhomogeneous\nmagnetic and electronic ground state.\n", "  We consider the Hassan-Rosen bimetric field equations in vacuum when the two\nmetrics share a single common null direction in a spherically symmetric\nconfiguration. By solving these equations, we obtain a class of exact solutions\nof the generalized Vaidya type parametrized by an arbitrary function. Besides\nnot being asymptotically flat, the found solutions are nonstationary admitting\nonly three global spacelike Killing vector fields which are the generators of\nspatial rotations. Hence, these are spherically symmetric bimetric vacuum\nsolutions with the minimal number of isometries. The absence of staticity\nformally disproves an analogue statement to Birkhoff's theorem in the\nghost-free bimetric theory which would state that a spherically symmetric\nsolution is necessarily static in empty space.\n", "  We present the results of a systematic mapping of seasonally sculpted\nterrains on the South Polar region of Mars with the Planet Four: Terrains (P4T)\nonline citizen science project. P4T enlists members of the general public to\nvisually identify features in the publicly released Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\nCTX images. In particular, P4T volunteers are asked to identify: 1) araneiforms\n(including features with a central pit and radiating channels known as\n'spiders'); 2) erosional depressions, troughs, mesas, ridges, and\nquasi-circular pits characteristic of the South Polar Residual Cap (SPRC) which\nwe collectively refer to as 'Swiss cheese terrain', and 3) craters. In this\nwork we present the distributions of our high confidence classic spider\naraneiforms and Swiss cheese terrain identifications. We find no locations\nwithin our high confidence spider sample that also have confident Swiss cheese\nterrain identifications. Previously spiders were reported as being confined to\nthe South Polar Layered Deposits (SPLD). Our work has provided the first\nidentification of spiders at locations outside of the SPLD, confirmed with high\nresolution HiRISE imaging. We find araneiforms on the Amazonian and Hesperian\npolar units and the Early Noachian highland units, with 75% of the identified\naraneiform locations in our high confidence sample residing on the SPLD. With\nour current coverage, we cannot confirm whether these are the only geologic\nunits conducive to araneiform formation on the Martian South Polar region. Our\nresults are consistent with the current CO2 jet formation scenario with the\nprocess exploiting weaknesses in the surface below the seasonal CO2 ice sheet\nto carve araneiform channels into the regolith over many seasons. These new\nregions serve as additional probes of the conditions required for channel\ncreation in the CO2 jet process. (Abridged)\n", "  Imaging through scattering media is encountered in many disciplines or\nsciences, ranging from biology, mesescopic physics and astronomy. But it is\nstill a big challenge because light suffers from multiple scattering is such\nmedia and can be totally decorrelated. Here, we propose a deep-learning-based\nmethod that can retrieve the image of a target behind a thick scattering\nmedium. The method uses a trained deep neural network to fit the way of mapping\nof objects at one side of a thick scattering medium to the corresponding\nspeckle patterns observed at the other side. For demonstration, we retrieve the\nimages of a set of objects hidden behind a 3mm thick white polystyrene slab,\nthe optical depth of which is 13.4 times of the scattering mean free path. Our\nwork opens up a new way to tackle the longstanding challenge by using the\ntechnique of deep learning.\n", "  There are various mathematical models proposed in the recent literature for\nestimating the h-index through bibliometric measures, such as number of\narticles (P) and citations received (C). These models have been previously\nempirically tested assuming a mathematical model and predetermining the models\nparameter values at some fixed constant. Here, by adopting a statistical\nmodelling view I investigate alternative distributions commonly used for this\ntype of point data. I also show that the typical assumptions for the parameters\nof the h-index mathematical models in such representations are not always\nrealistic, with more suitable specifications being favorable. Prediction of the\nhindex is also demonstrated.\n", "  An important disadvantage of the h-index is that typically it cannot take\ninto account the specific field of research of a researcher. Usually sample\npoint estimates of the average and median h-index values for the various fields\nare reported that are highly variable and dependent of the specific samples and\nit would be useful to provide confidence intervals of prediction accuracy. In\nthis paper we apply the non-parametric bootstrap technique for constructing\nconfidence intervals for the h-index for different fields of research. In this\nway no specific assumptions about the distribution of the empirical hindex are\nrequired as well as no large samples since that the methodology is based on\nresampling from the initial sample. The results of the analysis showed\nimportant differences between the various fields. The performance of the\nbootstrap intervals for the mean and median h-index for most fields seems to be\nrather satisfactory as revealed by the performed simulation.\n", "  The definition of a length operator in quantum cosmology is usually\ninfluenced by a~quantum theory for gravity considered. The semiclassical limit\nat the Planck age must meet the requirements implied in present observations.\nThe features of a semiclassical wave-functional state are investigated, for\nwhich the modern measure(ment)s is consistent. The results of a length\nmeasurement at present times are compared with the same measurement operation\nat cosmological times. By this measure, it is possible to discriminate, within\nthe same Planck-length expansion, the corrections to a Minkowski flat space\npossibly due to classicalization of quantum phenomena at the Planck time and\nthose due to possible quantum-gravitational manifestations of present times.\nThis~analysis and the comparison with the previous literature can be framed as\na test for the verification of the time at which anomalies at present related\nto the gravitational field, and, in particular, whether they are ascribed to\nthe classicalization epoch. Indeed, it allows to discriminate not only within\nthe possible quantum features of the quasi (Minkowski) flat spacetime, but also\nfrom (possibly Lorentz violating) phenomena detectable at high-energy\nastrophysical scales. The results of two different (coordinate) length measures\nhave been compared both at cosmological time and as a perturbation element on\nflat Minkowski spacetime. The differences for the components of the\ncorresponding classical(ized) metric tensor have been analyzed at different\norders of expansions. The comparison of the results of (straight) length\nmeasures in two different directions, in particular, can encode the pertinent\ninformation about the parameters defining the semiclassical wavefunctional for\n(semiclassicalized) gravitational field.\n", "  Age hardening induced by the formation of (semi)-coherent precipitate phases\nis crucial for the processing and final properties of the widely used Al-6000\nalloys. Early stages of precipitation are particularly important from the\nfundamental and technological side, but are still far from being fully\nunderstood. Here, an analysis of the energetics of nanometric precipitates of\nthe meta-stable $\\beta''$ phases is performed, identifying the bulk, elastic\nstrain and interface energies that contribute to the stability of a nucleating\ncluster. Results show that needle-shape precipitates are unstable to growth\neven at the smallest size $\\beta''$ formula unit, i.e. there is no energy\nbarrier to growth. The small differences between different compositions points\ntoward the need for the study of possible precipitate/matrix interface\nreconstruction. A classical semi-quantitative nucleation theory approach\nincluding elastic strain energy captures the trends in precipitate energy\nversus size and composition. This validates the use of mesoscale models to\nassess stability and interactions of precipitates. Studies of smaller 3d\nclusters also show stability relative to the solid solution state, indicating\nthat the early stages of precipitation may be diffusion-limited. Overall, these\nresults demonstrate the important interplay among composition-dependent bulk,\ninterface, and elastic strain energies in determining nanoscale precipitate\nstability and growth.\n", "  A doubly synchronous binary asteroid simultaneously experiences YORP and\nBYORP, the former being independent of the radius of the orbit, while the\nlatter linearly dependent on the radius. In many systems YORP and BYORP can\ncompensate each other at some radius, causing an equilibrium state, to which\nother orbits converge in the course of their evolution. We derive mathematical\nformalism of such equilibria in terms of dimensionless YORP and BYORP\ncoefficients. We compute YORP and BYORP coefficients for a set of photometric\nand radar shape models, and find equilibria to be relatively common.\n", "  Relativistic, electrically neutral point-particles can be given mathematical\nfoundation by doing a careful accounting of self-interaction energies. In this\npaper we examine a self-interaction parameter and present a continuous\nframework which interpolates between classical and relativistic\npoint-particles.\n", "  There are observational evidences for the existence of twisted magnetic field\nin the solar corona. This inspires us to investigate the effect of a twisted\nmagnetic field on the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink waves in\ncoronal loops. To this aim, we solve the incompressible linearized MHD\nequations in a magnetically twisted nonuniform coronal flux tube in the limit\nof long wavelengths. Our results show that a twisted magnetic field can enhance\nor diminish the rate of phase-mixing of the Alfv\\'{e}n continuum modes and the\ndecay rate of the global kink oscillation depending on the twist model and the\nsign of the longitudinal ($k_z$) and azimuthal ($m$) wavenumbers. Also our\nresults confirm that in the presence of a twisted magnetic field, when the sign\nof one of the two wavenumbers $m$ and $k_z$ is changed, the symmetry with\nrespect to the propagation direction is broken. Even a small amount of twist\ncan have an important impact on the process of energy cascade to small scales.\n", "  We formalized the nuclear mass problem in the inverse problem framework. This\napproach allows us to infer the underlying model parameters from experimental\nobservation, rather than to predict the observations from the model parameters.\nThe inverse problem was formulated for the numericaly generalized the\nsemi-empirical mass formula of Bethe and von Weizs\\\"{a}cker. It was solved in\nstep by step way based on the AME2012 nuclear database.\n  The solution of the overdetermined system of nonlinear equations has been\nobtained with the help of the Aleksandrov's auto-regularization method of\nGauss-Newton type for ill-posed problems. In the obtained generalized model the\ncorrections to the binding energy depend on nine proton (2, 8, 14, 20, 28, 50,\n82, 108, 124) and ten neutron (2, 8, 14, 20, 28, 50, 82, 124, 152, 202) magic\nnumbers as well on the asymptotic boundaries of their influence. These results\nhelp us to evaluate the borders of the nuclear landscape and show their limit.\nThe efficiency of the applied approach was checked by comparing relevant\nresults with the results obtained independently.\n", "  Glassiness is ubiquitous and diverse in characteristics in nature.\nUnderstanding their differences and classification remains a major scientific\nchallenge. Here, we show that scaling of magnetic memories with time can be\nused to classify magnetic glassy materials into two distinct classes. The\nsystems studied are high-temperature superconductor-related materials,\nspin-orbit Mott insulators, frustrated magnets, and dilute magnetic alloys. Our\nbulk magnetization measurements reveal that most densely populated magnets\nexhibit similar memory behavior characterized by a relaxation exponent of 1-n ~\n0.6(1). This exponent is different from 1-n ~ 1/3 of dilute magnetic alloys\nthat was ascribed to their hierarchical and fractal energy landscape and is\nalso different from 1-n=1 of the conventional Debye relaxation expected for a\nspin solid, a state with long range order. Furthermore, our systematic study on\ndilute magnetic alloys with varying magnetic concentration exhibits crossovers\namong the two glassy states and spin solid.\n", "  We report structural, optical, temperature and frequency dependent\ndielectric, and energy storage properties of pulsed laser deposited (100)\nhighly textured BaZr(x)Ti(1-x)O3 (x = 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5) relaxor ferroelectric\nthin films on La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/MgO substrates which make this compound as a\npotential lead-free capacitive energy storage material for scalable electronic\ndevices. A high dielectric constant of ~1400 - 3500 and a low dielectric loss\nof <0.025 were achieved at 10 kHz for all three compositions at ambient\nconditions. Ultrahigh stored and recoverable electrostatic energy densities as\nhigh as 214 +/- 1 and 156 +/- 1 J/cm3, respectively, were demonstrated at a\nsustained high electric field of ~3 MV/cm with an efficiency of 72.8 +/- 0.6 %\nin optimum 30% Zr substituted BaTiO3 composition.\n", "  The expansion of a radial blast shell into an ambient plasma is modeled with\na particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The unmagnetized plasma consists of\nelectrons and protons. The formation and evolution of an electrostatic shock is\nobserved, which is trailed by ion-acoustic solitary waves that grow on the beam\nof the blast shell ions in the post-shock plasma. In spite of the initially\nradially symmetric outflow, the solitary waves become twisted and entangled\nand, hence, they break the radial symmetry of the flow. The waves and their\ninteraction with the shocked ambient ions slows down the blast shell protons\nand brings the post-shock plasma closer to an equilibrium.\n", "  In this note we provide a combinatorial interpretation for the powers of the\nhypergraph Laplacians. Our motivation comes from the discrete formulation of\nquantum mechanics and thermodynamics in the case of finite graphs, which\nsuggest a natural extension to simplicial and CW-complexes. With this\nmotivation, we also define generalizations of the odd Laplacian which is\nspecific to hypergraphs arising from CW-complexes. We then provide a\ncombinatorial interpretation for the powers of these Laplacians.\n", "  The paper is concerned with the unsteady solutions to the model of mutually\npenetrating continua and quasilinear hyperbolic modification of the Burgers\nequation (QHMB). The studies were focused on the peculiar solutions of models\nin question. On the base of these models and their solutions, the ideas of\nsecond order quasilinear models classification were developed.\n", "  We present design and experimental validation of the system for the\ngeneration of the Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) states using 3D-printed\nlow-loss metamaterial phase plates for application in the terahertz (THz)\nwireless communications. By azimuthally varying the hole pattern density within\nthe phase plate, the local effective refractive index is varied, thus also\nchanging the local propagation constant in the azimuthal direction. The OAM of\nany topological charge can be created by simply varying the thickness of the\nphase plate. The phase plate with topological charge (m=1) is 3D printed and\nthe amplitude and the phase of the terahertz signal after passing the plate is\ncharacterized using the THz-time domain imaging system. Finally, we present the\nexperimental setup and theoretical simulation on the multiplexing and\nde-multiplexing of several different OAM states for applications in wireless\nterahertz communication.\n", "  Multilevel converters have found many applications within renewable energy\nsystems thanks to their unique capability of generating multiple voltage\nlevels. However, these converters need multiple DC sources and the voltage\nbalancing over capacitors for these systems is cumbersome. In this work, a new\ngrid-tie multicell inverter with high level of safety has been designed,\nengineered and optimized for integrating energy storage devices to the electric\ngrid. The multilevel converter proposed in this work is capable of maintaining\nthe flying capacitors voltage in the desired value. The solar cells are the\nprimary energy sources for proposed inverter where the maximum power density is\nobtained. Finally, the performance of the inverter and its control method\nsimulated using PSCAD/EMTDC software package and good agreement achieved with\nexperimental data.\n", "  In most physical sciences, students from underrepresented minority (URM)\ngroups constitute a small percentage of earned degrees at the undergraduate and\ngraduate levels. Bridge programs can serve as an initiative to increase the\nnumber of URM students that gain access to graduate school and earn advanced\ndegrees in physics. This talk discussed levels of representation in physical\nsciences as well as some results and best practices of current bridge programs\nin physics. The APS Bridge Program has enabled over 100 students to be placed\ninto Bridge or graduate programs in physics, while retaining 88% of those\nplaced.\n", "  To store information at extremely high-density and data-rate, we propose to\nadapt, integrate, and extend the techniques developed by chemists and molecular\nbiologists for the purpose of manipulating biological and other macromolecules.\nIn principle, volumetric densities in excess of 10^21 bits/cm^3 can be achieved\nwhen individual molecules having dimensions below a nanometer or so are used to\nencode the 0's and 1's of a binary string of data. In practice, however, given\nthe limitations of electron-beam lithography, thin film deposition and\npatterning technologies, molecular manipulation in submicron dimensions, etc.,\nwe believe that volumetric storage densities on the order of 10^16 bits/cm^3\n(i.e., petabytes per cubic centimeter) should be readily attainable, leaving\nplenty of room for future growth. The unique feature of the proposed new\napproach is its focus on the feasibility of storing bits of information in\nindividual molecules, each only a few angstroms in size.\n", "  I construct non-Fermi liquid (NFL) quantum impurity models that are similar\nto the overscreened multi-channel Kondo models with the difference that an odd\nnumber of electron species screen the impurity. The simplest of them, named\nsesqui-channel (i.e. one-and-a-half-channel) Kondo (1.5CK) model, has less\ndegrees of freedom and is simpler than the two-channel Kondo model, and yet it\nexhibits NFL physics. Using representation theory I derive the 1.5CK model for\na spin-half impurity surrounded with electrons in cubic crystal field and solve\nit with the numerical renormalization group.\n", "  We investigate the distribution of the resonances near spectral thresholds of\nLaplace operators on regular tree graphs with $k$-fold branching, $k \\geq 1$,\nperturbed by nonself-adjoint exponentially decaying potentials. We establish\nresults on the absence of resonances which in particular involve absence of\ndiscrete spectrum near some sectors of the essential spectrum of the operators.\n", "  The low-energy physics of graphene is described by relativistic Dirac\nfermions with spin and valley degrees of freedom. Mechanical strain can be used\nto create a pseudo magnetic field pointing to opposite directions in the two\nvalleys. We study interacting electrons in graphene exposed to both an external\nreal magnetic field and a strain-induced pseudo magnetic field. For a certain\nratio between these two fields, it is proposed that a fermionic\nsymmetry-protected topological state can be realized. The state is\ncharacterized in detail using model wave functions, Chern-Simons field theory,\nand numerical calculations. Our paper suggests that graphene with artificial\ngauge fields may host a rich set of topological states.\n", "  By applying quantum chemical calculation, interstellar infrared spectrum was\ncategorized to three classes. Type-A show unusual feature of strong peaks at\n11.3,12.9, and 14.0 micrometer. Usually observed 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 micrometer\nbands are weak or not recognized. Typical examples are NGC1316 and NGC4589.\nSuch spectrum could be identified for the first time by pure carbon molecule\n(C23)2+ (dication) having two carbon pentagons combined with five hexagons.\nCalculated spectrum coincided well at 11.3, 13.0, and 14.0 micrometer. Also we\ncould find more coincidence at 5.2, 5.6, 7.6, 8.8,10.6,15.7 and 17.2\nmicrometer. Type-B is ubiquitously observed IR, but show medium strength at\n11.3 micrometer. Examples are NGC6946 and the red triangle nebula. Coronene\nmodified PAH (C23H12)2+ show best coincidence for both wavelength and strength.\nType-C is usualy observed one featuring very strong peak at 11.3 micrometer.\nExamples are NGC7023, NGC2023 and M17SW. One capable expanation of large 11.3\nmicrometer band is a mixture of Type-A and Type-B. Combination of polycyclic\npure-carbon-molecule and hydrocarbon-molecule may give a variety of IR\nspectrum.\n", "  The Sparsity of the Gradient (SoG) is a robust autofocusing criterion for\nholography, where the gradient modulus of the complex refocused hologram is\ncalculated, on which a sparsity metric is applied. Here, we compare two\ndifferent choices of sparsity metrics used in SoG, specifically, the Gini index\n(GI) and the Tamura coefficient (TC), for holographic autofocusing on\ndense/connected or sparse samples. We provide a theoretical analysis predicting\nthat for uniformly distributed image data, TC and GI exhibit similar behavior,\nwhile for naturally sparse images containing few high-valued signal entries and\nmany low-valued noisy background pixels, TC is more sensitive to distribution\nchanges in the signal and more resistive to background noise. These predictions\nare also confirmed by experimental results using SoG-based holographic\nautofocusing on dense and connected samples (such as stained breast tissue\nsections) as well as highly sparse samples (such as isolated Giardia lamblia\ncysts). Through these experiments, we found that ToG and GoG offer almost\nidentical autofocusing performance on dense and connected samples, whereas for\nnaturally sparse samples, GoG should be calculated on a relatively small region\nof interest (ROI) closely surrounding the object, while ToG offers more\nflexibility in choosing a larger ROI containing more background pixels.\n", "  We generalize the Catani Hautmann formalism to calculate the Pgq and Pqq\ntransverse momentum dependent splitting functions. Then we use the obtained Pgq\nkernel to construct a low-x evolution equation for gluons that takes into\naccount the effect of non-diagonal quark-to-gluon splittings. In order to write\ndown a consistent equation we resum virtual corrections coming from the gluon\nchannel and demonstrate that this implies a suitable regularization of the Pgq\nsingularity, corresponding to a soft emitted quark. We also note that the\nobtained equation is in a straightforward manner generalized to a nonlinear\nevolution equation which takes into account effects due to the presence of high\ngluon densities.\n", "  Many-body localization was proven under realistic assumptions by constructing\na quasi-local unitary rotation that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian (Imbrie,\n2016). A natural generalization is to consider all unitaries that have a\nsimilar structure. We bound entanglement for states generated by such\nunitaries, thus providing an independent proof of area law in eigenstates of\nmany-body localized systems. An error of approximating the unitary by a\nfinite-depth local circuit is obtained. We connect the defined family of\nunitaries to other results about many-body localization (Kim et al, 2014), in\nparticular Lieb-Robinson bound. Finally we argue that any Hamiltonian can be\ndiagonalized by such a unitary, given it has a slow enough logarithmic\nlightcone in its Lieb-Robinson bound.\n", "  We suggest that the forward-backward asymmetry $(A_{FB})$ of the charged\nlepton in $gg\\to H\\to\\gamma Z\\to\\gamma \\ell^-\\ell^+$ process could be used to\nprobe the CP violating $H\\gamma Z$ coupling when the interference from\n$gg\\to\\gamma Z\\to\\gamma \\ell^-\\ell^+$ process is included. With CP violation in\n$H\\gamma Z$ coupling, the interference effect leads to a non-vanishing\n$A_{FB}$, which is also sensitive to the strong phase differences. The resonant\nand non-resonant strong phases together make $A_{FB}(\\hat{s})$ change sign\naround Higgs mass $M_H$. For phenomenology study, we suggest the integral over\none-side mass region below $M_H$ to magnify the $A_{FB}$ strength.\n", "  The PHENIX experiment discovered a large excess of low-$p_{T}$ direct photons\nin Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV compared to reference p+p collisions, which has\nbeen attributed to thermal radiation from the medium produced in the\ncollisions. At the same time the excess photons show a large azimuthal\nanisotropy, expressed as Fourier coefficients $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$. These\nsurprising results have not yet been fully described by theoretical models. We\nwill present the results obtained from real photons in the electromagnetic\ncalorimeter and photons converted on the outer shell of the Hadron Blind\nDetector. PHENIX has also developed a new technique to identify conversion\nphotons without assuming the radius where the conversion happened. This method\ngreatly increases the available statistics and reduces systematic\nuncertainties.\n", "  Three decades into the research seeking to derive the urban energy budget,\nthe dynamics of the thermal exchange between the densely built infrastructure\nand the environment are still not well understood. We present a novel hybrid\nexperimental-numerical approach for the analysis of the radiative heat transfer\nin New York City. The aim of this work is to contribute to the calculation of\nthe urban energy budget, in particular the stored energy. Improved\nunderstanding of urban thermodynamics incorporating the interaction of the\nvarious bodies will have implications on energy conservation at the building\nscale, as well as human health and comfort at the urban scale. The platform\npresented is based on longwave hyperspectral imaging of nearly 100 blocks of\nManhattan, and a geospatial radiosity model that describes the collective\nradiative heat exchange between multiple buildings. The close comparison of\ntemperature values derived from measurements and the computed surface\ntemperatures (including streets and roads) implies that this geospatial,\nthermodynamic numerical model applied to urban structures, is promising for\naccurate and high resolution analysis of urban surface temperatures.\n", "  We consider typical experiments that use Bell-inequalities to test\nlocal-realist theories of quantum mechanics and gain insight into how certain\nresults can be obtained. We see that results against local-realism arise from\nsome `quantum skew' of the correlation between entangled qubit pairs.\nFurthermore, we find some conditions necessary for a conclusion against\nlocal-realism. Finally we show that the problem of `no-signalling' that arises\nin these experiments cannot be reduced to arbitrary experimental accuracy.\n", "  Gaseous thermal transpiration flows through a rectangular micro-channel are\nsimulated by the direct simulation BGK (DSBGK) method. These flows are\nrarefied, within the slip and transitional flow regimes, which are beyond many\ntraditional computational fluid dynamic simulation schemes, such as those based\non the continuum flow assumption. The flows are very slow and thus many\ntraditional particle simulation methods suffer large statistical noises. The\nadopted method is a combination of particle and gas kinetic methods and it can\nsimulate micro-flows properly. The simulation results of mass flow rates have\nexcellent agreement with experimental measurements. Another finding from this\nstudy is that numerical simulations by including two reservoirs at the channel\nends lead to appreciable differences in simulation results of velocity and\npressure distributions within the micro-channel. This is due to the inhaling\nand exhaling effects of reservoirs at the channel ends. Even though excluding\nthose reservoirs may accelerate the simulations significantly by using a single\nchannel in simulations, special attentions are needed because this treatment\nmay over-simplify the problem, and some procedures and results may be\nquestionable. One example is to determine the surface momentum accommodation\ncoefficient by using analytical solution of the mass flow rate obtained in a\nsingle-channel problem without the confinement effect of reservoirs at the two\nends.\n", "  We describe the algebraic ingredients of a proof of the conjecture of Frenkel\nand Ip that the category of positive representations $\\mathcal{P}_\\lambda$ of\nthe quantum group $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1})$ is closed under tensor products.\nOur results generalize those of Ponsot and Teschner in the rank 1 case of\n$U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. In higher rank, many nontrivial features appear, the\nmost important of these being a surprising connection to the quantum\nintegrability of the open Coxeter-Toda lattice. We show that the closure under\ntensor products follows from the orthogonality and completeness of the Toda\neigenfunctions (i.e. the q-Whittaker functions), and obtain an explicit\nconstruction of the Clebsch-Gordan intertwiner giving the decomposition of\n$\\mathcal{P}_\\lambda \\otimes \\mathcal{P}_\\mu$ into irreducibles.\n", "  We develop a classification scheme for the evolutionary state of planets\nbased on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of their coupled systems, including\nthe presence of a biosphere and the possibility of what we call an\nagency-dominated biosphere (i.e. an energy-intensive technological species).\nThe premise is that Earths entry into the Anthropocene represents what might be\nfrom an astrobiological perspective a predictable planetary transition. We\nexplore this problem from the perspective of the solar system and exoplanet\nstudies. Our classification discriminates planets by the forms of free energy\ngeneration driven from stellar forcing. We then explore how timescales for\nglobal evolutionary processes on Earth might be synchronized with ecological\ntransformations driven by increases in energy harvesting and its consequences\n(which might have reached a turning point with global urbanization). Finally,\nwe describe quantitatively the classification scheme based on the maintenance\nof chemical disequilibrium in the past and current Earth systems and on other\nworlds in the solar system. In this perspective, the beginning of the\nAnthropocene can be seen as the onset of the hybridization of the planet - a\ntransitional stage from one class of planetary systems interaction to another.\nFor Earth, this stage occurs as the effects of human civilization yield not\njust new evolutionary pressures, but new selected directions for novel\nplanetary ecosystem functions and their capacity to generate disequilibrium and\nenhance planetary dissipation.\n", "  The structural and electronic properties of the clathrate compounds\nBa$_{8}$Al$_{x}$Si$_{46-x}$ and Sr$_{8}$Al$_{x}$Si$_{46-x}$ are studied from\nfirst principles, considering an Al content $x$ between 6 and 16. Due to the\nlarge number of possible substitutional configurations we make use of a special\niterative cluster-expansion approach, to predict ground states and\nquasi-degenerate structures in a highly efficient way. These are found from a\nsimulated annealing technique where millions of configurations are sampled. For\nboth compounds, we find a linear increase of the lattice constant with the\nnumber of Al substituents, confirming experimental observations for\nBa$_{8}$Al$_{x}$Si$_{46-x}$. Also the calculated bond distances between\nhigh-symmetry sites agree well with experiment for the full compositional\nrange. For $x$ being below 16, all configurations are metallic for both\nmaterials. At the charge-balanced composition ($x=16$), the substitutional\nordering leads to a metal-semiconductor transition, and the ground states of\nBa$_{8}$Al$_{16}$Si$_{30}$ and Sr$_{8}$Al$_{16}$Si$_{30}$ exhibit indirect\nKohn-Sham band gaps of 0.36 and 0.30 eV, respectively, while configurations\nhigher in energy are metals. The finding of semiconducting behavior is a\npromising result in view of exploiting these materials in thermoelectric\napplications.\n", "  Utilizing the Hirsch index h and some of its variants for an exploratory\nfactor analysis we discuss whether one of the most important Hirsch-type\nindices, namely the g-index comprises information about not only the size of\nthe productive core but also the impact of the papers in the core. We also\nstudy the effect of logarithmic and square-root transformation of the data\nutilized in the factor analysis. To demonstrate our approach we use a real data\nexample analysing the citation records of 26 physicists compiled from the Web\nof Science.\n", "  We describe a technique for surface and sub-surface micro-machining of glass\nsubstrates using tightly focused femtosecond laser pulses at a wavelength of\n1660 nm. Although silicate glass is normally transparent at this wavelength,\nthe extremely high intensity of the focused beam causes multi-photon\nabsorption, resulting in localized ablation of the glass substrate. Ablation is\nstrictly confined to the vicinity of focus, leaving the rest of the substrate\nunaffected. We exploit this phenomenon to drill a micro-hole through a thin\nvertical wall that separates two adjacent pits machined by the same laser in a\nglass plate. A salient feature of pulsed laser micro-machining, therefore, is\nits ability to drill sub-surface tunnels and canals into glass substrates, a\nprocess that requires multiple steps in standard lithography. To demonstrate a\npotential application of this micro-machining technique, we have fabricated\nsimple micro-fluidic structures on a glass plate. To prevent the evaporation of\nliquids in open micro-channels and micro-chambers thus fabricated requires a\ncover plate that seals the device by making point-to-point contact with the\nflat surface of the substrate. This point-to-point contacting is essential if\nthe fluids are to remain confined within their various channels and chambers on\nthe chip, without leaking into neighboring regions. Methods of protecting and\nsealing the micro-machined structures for microfluidic applications are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Landau was the first to advance hydrodynamic concepts such as density and\nvelocity to describe the superfluidity of liquid He$^4$. Due to the recent\nspectacular success of experiments demonstrating Bose Einstein condensation in\ndilute Bose atomic gases, interest has been revitalized in the theoretical\ndescription of Bose Einstein condensates. Many of the properties of these gases\nwere obtained by using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) to derive the\nhydrodynamic equations for the gases. However, it is interesting to apply the\nhydrodynamic equations obtained by Yee for bosons. Many of the properties\nobtained for the dilute Bose gases are also consequences of Yee's hydrodynamic\nequations, which derive from a formalism distinct from that of the GPE.\n", "  We find a new $CP$ violating effect in charmed hadron decays into neutral\nkaons, which is induced by the interference between the Cabibbo-favored and\ndoubly Cabibbo-suppressed amplitudes with the $K^{0}-\\overline K^{0}$ mixing.\nIt is estimated to be of order of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, much larger than the\ndirect $CP$ asymmetry, but missed in the literature. To reveal this new $CP$\nviolation effect, we propose a new observable, the difference of the $CP$\nasymmetries in the $D^{+}\\to \\pi^{+}K_S^0$ and $D_{s}^{+}\\to K^{+} K_S^0$\nmodes. Once the new effect is determined by experiments, the direct $CP$\nasymmetry then can be extracted and used to search for new physics.\n", "  We give a detailed description of the installation and operation of a\ndouble-station meteor detection system which formed part of a research &\neducation project between Korea Astronomy Space Science Institute and Daejeon\nScience Highschool. A total of six light-sensitive CCD cameras were installed\nwith three cameras at SOAO and three cameras at BOAO observatory. A\ndouble-station observation of a meteor event enables the determination of the\nthree-dimensional orbit in space. This project was initiated in response to the\nJinju fireball event in March 2014. The cameras were installed in\nOctober/November 2014. The two stations are identical in hardware as well as\nsoftware. Each station employes sensitive Watec-902H2 cameras in combination\nwith relatively fast f/1.2 lenses. Various fields of views were used for\nmeasuring differences in detection rates of meteor events. We employed the\nSonotaCo UFO software suite for meteor detection and their subsequent analysis.\nThe system setup as well as installation/operation experience is described and\nfirst results are presented. We also give a brief overview of historic as well\nas recent meteor (fall) detections in South Korea. For more information please\nconsult http://meteor.kasi.re.kr .\n", "  We analyze the method of optimal balance which was introduced by Viudez and\nDritschel (J. Fluid Mech. 521, 2004, pp. 343-352) to provide balanced\ninitializations for two-dimensional and three-dimensional geophysical flows,\nhere in the simpler context of a finite dimensional Hamiltonian two-scale\nsystem with strong gyroscopic forces. It is well known that when the potential\nis analytic, such systems have an approximate slow manifold that is defined up\nto terms that are exponentially small with respect to the scale separation\nparameter. The method of optimal balance relies on the observation that the\napproximate slow manifold remains an adiabatic invariant under slow\ndeformations of the nonlinear interactions. The method is formulated as a\nboundary value problem for a homotopic deformation of the system from a linear\nregime, where the slow-fast splitting is known exactly, to the full nonlinear\nregime. We show that, providing the ramp function which defines the homotopy is\nof Gevrey class 2 and satisfies vanishing conditions to all orders at the\ntemporal end points, the solution of the optimal balance boundary value problem\nyields a point on the approximate slow manifold that is exponentially close to\nthe approximation to the slow manifold via exponential asymptotics, albeit with\na smaller power of the small parameter in the exponent. In general, the order\nof accuracy of optimal balance is limited by the order of vanishing derivatives\nof the ramp function at the temporal end points. We also give a numerical\ndemonstration of the efficacy of optimal balance, showing the dependence of\naccuracy on the ramp time and the ramp function.\n", "  The mass distribution of stellar mass black holes can provide important clues\nto supernova modeling, but observationally it is still ill constrained.\nTherefore it is of importance to make black hole mass measurements as accurate\nas possible. The X-ray transient 1A 0620-00 is well studied, with a published\nblack hole mass of $6.61\\pm0.25\\,$M$_{\\odot}$, based on an orbital inclination\n$i$ of $51.0\\pm0.9$ degrees. This was obtained by Cantrell et al. (2010), as an\naverage of independent fits to $V$-, $I$- and $H$-band light curves. In this\nwork we perform an independent check on the value of $i$ by re-analyzing\nexisting YALO/SMARTS $V$-, $I$- and $H$-band photometry, using different\nmodeling software and fitting strategy. Performing a fit to the three light\ncurves simultaneously, we obtain a value for $i$ of $54.1\\pm1.1$ degrees,\nresulting in a black hole mass of $5.86\\pm0.24\\,$M$_{\\odot}$. Applying the same\nmodel to the light curves individually, we obtain $58.2\\pm1.9$, $53.6\\pm1.6$\nand $50.5\\pm2.2$ degrees for $V$-, $I$- and $H$-band, respectively, where the\ndifferences in best-fitting $i$ are caused by the contribution of the residual\naccretion disc light in the three different bands. We conclude that the mass\ndetermination of this black hole may still be subject to systematic effects\nexceeding the statistical uncertainty. Obtaining more accurate masses would be\ngreatly helped by continuous phase-resolved spectroscopic observations\nsimultaneous with photometry.\n", "  The effect of two loop correction in the formation of quark-gluon plasma\n(QGP) droplet is studied with the introduction of the two loop correction\nfactor in the mean field potential. Due to the correction factor it shows\nstability in the droplet formation of QGP indicating at different\nparametrization factors of the QGP fluid. The correction factor in the\npotential also shows gluon parameter factor shifts to a larger value from its\nearlier value of gluon factor of one loop correction in obtaining the stable\ndroplets. The results show decreasing in the observable QGP droplets and\ndroplet sizes are found to be $1.5-2.0$ fm radii with the two loop correction.\nIt indicates that there is parameter like Reynold's number which can control\nthe dynamics of QGP droplet formation and the stability of droplet in the case\nof droplet formation with the two loop correction factor.\n", "  Gauging the flavor (family, generation, horizontal) index of the chiral\nfermion fields of the Standard model, for anomaly freedom extended by three\nsterile right-handed neutrino fields, results in asymptotically free, {\\it bona\nfide} nonconfining $SU(3)_f$ quantum flavor dynamics. Approximate\nnonperturbative strong-coupling solutions of the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson\n(SD) equation for fermion self-energies give rise to the complete flavor\nsymmetry breaking by : (1) Three huge Majorana masses of sterile right-handed\nneutrinos. (2) Three exponentially light Dirac masses common to all fermion\nsorts in a family. Masses of charged leptons and quarks are further\ndistinguished from Dirac neutrino masses by the weak hypercharge contributions\nto the universal $SU(3)_f$ kernel of the SD equation, free of unknown\nparameters. The $SU(3)_f$ dynamics itself thus gives the neutrino mass spectrum\nin the seesaw form.\n", "  The behaviour of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in the atmosphere is highly\ndependent on their thermal properties. Here we investigate the volatility of\nSOA formed from alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and limonene upon ozone- and\nOH-induced oxidation, and the effect of OH-induced ageing on the initially\nproduced SOA. For all three terpenes, the ozone-induced SOA was less volatile\nthan the OH-induced SOA. The thermal properties of the SOA were described using\nthree parameters extracted from the volatility measurements: the temperature at\nwhich 50 per cent of the volume has evaporated (TVFR0.5), which is used as a\ngeneral volatility indicator; a slope factor (SVFR), which describes the\nvolatility distribution; and TVFR0.1, which measures the volatility of the\nleast volatile particle fraction. Limonene-derived SOA generally had higher\nTVFR0.5 values and shallower slopes than SOA derived from alpha- and\nbeta-pinene. This was especially true for the ozone-induced SOA, partially\nbecause the ozonolysis of limonene has a strong tendency to cause SOA formation\nand to produce extremely low volatility VOCs (ELVOCs). Ageing by OH exposure\ndid not reduce TVFR0.5 for any of the studied terpenes but did increase the\nbreadth of the volatility distribution by increasing the aerosols heterogeneity\nand contents of substances with different vapour pressures, also leading to\nincreases in TVFR0.1. This stands in contrast to previously reported results\nfrom smog chamber experiments, in which TVFR0.5 always increased with ageing.\nThese results demonstrate that there are two opposing processes that influence\nthe evolution of SOAs thermal properties as they age, and that results from\nboth flow reactors and static chambers are needed to fully understand the\ntemporal evolution of atmospheric SOA thermal properties.\n", "  Quantum cognition in decision-making is a recent and rapidely growing field.\nIn this paper we develop an expected utility theory in a context of\nnon-classical (quantum) uncertainty. We replace the classical state space with\na Hilbert space which allows introducing the concept of quantum lottery. Within\nthat framework we formulate axioms on preferences over quantum lotteries to\nestablish a representation theorem. We show that demanding the consistency of\nchoice behavior conditional on new information is equivalent to the von\nNeuman-L\\\"uders postulate applied to beliefs. A dynamically consistent\nquantum-like agent may violate dynamic recursive consistency, however. This\nfeature suggests interesting applications in behavioral economics as we\nillustrate in an example of persuasion.\n", "  Here we combine observations of open clusters (OCs) with single- and binary\npopulation synthesis models and a Galactic potential to reconstruct the SN\nactivity of these OCs during the past 35 Myr. We find that several OCs\npotentially hosting SN progenitors have passed within 100 pc of the Sun during\nthe past 35 Myr. In particular we find that ASCC 19, NGC 1981, and NGC 1976 are\nlikely to have hosted one or more SNe while passing within 200 pc of the solar\nsystem in the period 17 - 12 Myr BP which might have affected Earths' geology\nand climate. Besides the stellar history of the individual OCs we also compute\n1) a spatial and temporal 2D-probability density map showing the most likely\nposition and time of SN from our sample of OCs within 1 kpc during the past 35\nMyr, 2) the time series of the SN rate per volume and 3) the relative SN rate\ncompared with today and corrected for OC evaporation of older generations. The\nSN rate today from core collapse is estimated to be 37.8$\\pm$6.1$\\rm kpc^{-3}\nMyr^{-1}$. During the past 35 Myr we find a peak SN rate around 10 Myr before\npresent (BP) where the rate was 40% higher relative to the past 1 Myr. Finally\nwe discuss possible effects of binary stellar evolution in relation to the\nhistory of SN production in the solar neighbourhood and the detected $\\rm\n^{60}Fe$ signal in terrestrial geological samples induced between $\\sim$2.2 -\n2.8Myr BP.\n", "  The latest results on searches for production of two Higgs bosons with the\nCMS detector using the 2016 CERN LHC dataset are presented, as shown at the\nLHCP 2017 conference.\n", "  An overview of the boosted top production analyses using data collected by\nthe ATLAS and CMS experiments at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV and 13 TeV of proton-proton\ncollisions at the LHC is presented. These analyses use techniques for the\nreconstruction of boosted objects to measure the production of top quarks at\nhigh transverse momenta. The measurements are optimized for the different final\nstates and for different ranges of the transverse momenta of the particles\ninvolved, improving on measurements with traditional objects reconstruction\nbased on the combination of resolved objects.\n", "  WTe2 has attracted a great deal of attention because it exhibits extremely\nlarge and nonsaturating magnetoresistance. The underlying origin of such a\ngiant magnetoresistance is still under debate. Utilizing laser-based\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with high energy and momentum\nresolutions, we reveal the complete electronic structure of WTe2. This makes it\npossible to determine accurately the electron and hole concentrations and their\ntemperature dependence. We find that, with increasing the temperature, the\noverall electron concentration increases while the total hole concentration\ndecreases. It indicates that the electron-hole compensation, if it exists, can\nonly occur in a narrow temperature range, and in most of the temperature range\nthere is an electron-hole imbalance. Our results are not consistent with the\nperfect electron-hole compensation picture that is commonly considered to be\nthe cause of the unusual magnetoresistance in WTe2. We identified a flat band\nnear the Brillouin zone center that is close to the Fermi level and exhibits a\npronounced temperature dependence. Such a flat band can play an important role\nin dictating the transport properties of WTe2. Our results provide new insight\non understanding the origin of the unusual magnetoresistance in WTe2.\n", "  New high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometer observations of the\nprominent jet in the M87 radio galaxy show a persistent triple-ridge structure\nof the transverse 15-GHz profile with a previously unobserved ultra-narrow\ncentral ridge. This radio structure can reflect the intrinsic structure of the\njet, so that the jet as a whole consists of two embedded coaxial jets. A\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic model is considered in which an inner jet is\nplaced inside a hollow outer jet and the electromagnetic fields, pressures and\nother physical quantities are found. The entire jet is connected to the central\nengine that plays the role of a unipolar inductor generating voltage between\nthe jets and providing opposite electric currents, and the charge neutrality\nand current closure together with the electromagnetic fields between the jets\ncan contribute to the jet stabilization. The constant voltage is responsible\nfor the similar widening laws observed for the inner and outer jets. This\njet-in-jet structure can indicate simultaneous operation of two different\njet-launching mechanisms, one relating to the central supermassive black hole\nand the other to the surrounding accretion disc. An inferred magnetic field of\n80 G at the base is sufficient to provide the observed jet luminosity.\n", "  Using Ensemble Monte Carlo simulations the photocurrent in a 500nm long\nstrained [110] silicon nanowire with diameter of 3.1 nm is investigated. It was\nobserved that a phototransistor based on this nanowire can have responsivities\nin the order of 21.3 mA/W for an input light wavelength of 532 nm and intensity\nof 0.25-2.5 kW/cm2. The super-unity slope of 1.2 in photo conductance versus\ninput light intensity suggests that the nanowire has a photoconductive gain and\nhighlights its advantage over germanium nanowires with sub-unity slope (0.77).\nThe generated photocurrents are in the 0.1 nA-1 nA range. Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) and Tight Binding (TB) methods were used for strain application\nand band structure calculation, respectively. Both longitudinal acoustic and\noptical phonons were included in the calculation of the carrier-phonon\nscattering events, which showed a two-order of magnitude stronger role for\nlongitudinal optical phonons.\n", "  The complexity of big data structures and networks demands more research in\nterms of analysing and representing data for a better comprehension and usage.\nIn this regard, there are several types of model to represent a structure. The\naim of this article is to use a social network topology to analyse road network\nfor the following States in the United States, US:\n  California, Pennsylvania and Texas. Our approach mainly focuses on clustering\nof road network data in order to create \"communities\".\n", "  In this paper, we consider $2+1$ dimensional gravitational theory including a\nDirac field that is minimally coupled to New Massive Gravity. We investigate\ncosmological solutions of the field equations by using the self-interaction\npotential form obtained by the existence of Noether symmetry. In this context,\nwe obtain cosmological solutions that corresponds to inflationary as well as\nthe oscillationary epochs of the universe. Moreover, we have seen that the\nDirac field behaves like a dark energy in these epochs of the universe.\n", "  We discuss spontaneous symmetry breaking of dual (space and time) scale\ninvariance in the context of turbulence.\n", "  The E08-027 (g2p) experiment measured the spin structure functions of the\nproton at Jefferson Laboratory in Newport News, Va. Longitudinally polarized\nelectrons were scattered from a transversely and longitudinally polarized solid\nammonia target in Hall A, with the polarized NH$_3$ acting as an effective\nproton target. Focusing on small scattering angle events at the electron\nenergies available at Jefferson Lab, the experiment covered a kinematic phase\nspace of 0.02 GeV$^2$ $< Q^2 <$ 0.20 GeV$^2$ in the proton's resonance region.\nThe spin structure functions, $g_{1}^p(x,Q^2)$ and $g_{2}^p(x,Q^2)$ , are\nextracted from an inclusive polarized cross section measurement of the\nelectron-proton interaction. Integrated moments of $g_1(x,Q^2)$ are calculated\nand compared to theoretical predictions made by Chiral Perturbation Theory. The\n$g_1(x,Q^2)$ results are in agreement with previous measurements, but include a\nsignificant increase in statistical precision. The spin structure function\ncontributions to the hyperfine energy levels in the hydrogen atom are also\ninvestigated. The $g_2(x,Q^2)$ measured contribution to the hyperfine splitting\nis the first ever experimental determination of this quantity. The results of\nthis thesis suggest a disagreement of over 100% with previously published model\nresults.\n", "  This review discusses research developments and applications of\nisotachophoresis (ITP) to the initiation, control, and acceleration of chemical\nreactions, emphasizing reactions involving biomolecular reactants such as\nnucleic acids, proteins, and live cells. ITP is a versatile technique which\nrequires no specific geometric design or material, and is compatible with a\nwide range of microfluidic and automated platforms. Though ITP has\ntraditionally been used as a purification and separation technique, recent\nyears have seen its emergence as a method to automate and speed up chemical\nreactions. ITP has been used to demonstrate up to 14,000-fold acceleration of\nnucleic acid assays, and has been used to enhance lateral flow and other\nimmunoassays, and even whole bacterial cell detection assays. We here classify\nthese studies into two categories: homogeneous (all reactants in solution) and\nheterogeneous (at least one reactant immobilized on a solid surface) assay\nconfigurations. For each category, we review and describe physical modeling and\nscaling of ITP-aided reaction assays, and elucidate key principles in ITP assay\ndesign. We summarize experimental advances, and identify common threads and\napproaches which researchers have used to optimize assay performance. Lastly,\nwe propose unaddressed challenges and opportunities that could further improve\nthese applications of ITP.\n", "  This article embraces a theoretical description of the first order phase\ntransition in liquid metals with application of a cell fluid model. The results\nare obtained through calculation of the grand partition function without usage\nof phenomenological parameters. The Morse potential is used for calculation of\nthe equation of state and the coexistence curve. Specific results for sodium\nand potassium are obtained. Comparison of outcome of analytical expressions\nwith data of computer simulations is presented.\n", "  The present paper is part of a series of articles dedicated to the existence\nof Arnold diffusion for cusp-residual perturbations of Tonelli Hamiltonians on\n$\\mathbb{A}^3$. Our goal here is to construct an abstract geometric framework\nthat can be used to prove the existence of diffusing orbits in the so-called a\npriori stable setting, once the preliminary geometric reductions are preformed.\nOur framework also applies, rather directly, to the a priori unstable setting.\n  The main geometric objects of interest are $3$-dimensional normally\nhyperbolic invariant cylinders with boundary, which in particular admit\nwell-defined stable and unstable manifolds. These enable us to define, in our\nsetting, chains of cylinders, i.e., finite, ordered families of cylinders in\nwhich each cylinder admits homoclinic connections, and any two consecutive\nelements in the family admit heteroclinic connections.\n  Our main result is the existence of diffusing orbits drifting along such\nchains, under precise conditions on the dynamics on the cylinders, and on their\nhomoclinic and heteroclinic structure.\n", "  Static spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein's equations is found\nrepresenting averaged properties of an infinite self-gravitating gas in the\ndynamical equilibrium. It depends upon three parameters: the core radius, the\nrelativistic factor $0<z<1$, defining the density and the mass, and one\nstructural parameter. In the relativistic limit, $z\\to 1$, an open nucleus of\nfocused gravitational fields develops with the size being a small fraction of\nthe core radius whereas the outskirts of the self-gravitating gas remains\nnon-relativistic. Inside the nucleus the self-gravitating gas is described by a\nuniversal perfect fluid with the relativistic one-dimensional equation of\nstate. At $z=1$, the space and time develops a point like singularity at the\ncenter. A characteristic property of the nucleus is incompressibility. New\nparticles added to the self-gravitating gas bounce back into the outskirts\nrather than fall into the center.\n", "  These are the notes written for the talk given at the workshop Rethinking\nfoundations of physics 2016. In section 2, a derivation of the the quantum\nformalism starting from propositional calculus (quantum logic) is reviewed,\npointing out which are the basic requirements that lead to the use of Hilbert\nspaces. In section 3, a similar analysis is done following for the\nreconstruction of quantum theory using an operational approach. In both cases,\nnon-commutativity plays a crucial role. Finally, in section 4a toy model which\ntry to motivate non-commutativity is proposed. Despite this last section is\ninteresting to read, the analysis performed there is not complete. This toy\nmodel will be re-formulated in a rigorous way (and extended) in future works.\n", "  The students are introduced to navigation in general and the longitude\nproblem in particular. A few videos provide insight into scientific and\nhistorical facts related to the issue. Then, the students learn in two steps\nhow longitude can be derived from time measurements. They first build a\nLongitude Clock that visualises the math behind the concept. They use it to\ndetermine the longitudes corresponding to five time measurements. In the second\nstep, they assume the position of James Cook's navigator and plot the location\nof seven destinations on Cook's second voyage between 1772 and 1775.\n", "  We demonstrate the ability of a phase-sensitive amplifier (PSA) to\npre-amplify a selected quadrature of one mode of a two-mode squeezed state in\norder to improve the measurement of two-mode quantum correlations that exist\nbefore degradation due to optical and detection losses. We use four-wave mixing\n(4WM) in $^{85}$Rb vapor to generate bright beams in a two-mode squeezed state.\nOne of these two modes then passes through a second 4WM interaction in a PSA\nconfiguration to noiselessly pre-amplify the desired quadrature of the mode\nbefore loss is intentionally introduced. We demonstrate an enhancement in the\nmeasured degree of intensity correlation and intensity-difference squeezing\nbetween the two modes.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss biological effects of electromagnetic (EM) fields\nin the context of cancer biology. In particular, we review the nanomechanical\nproperties of microtubules (MTs), the latter being one of the most successful\ntargets for cancer therapy. We propose an investigation on the coupling of\nelectromagnetic radiation to mechanical vibrations of MTs as an important basis\nfor biological and medical applications. In our opinion optomechanical methods\ncan accurately monitor and control the mechanical properties of isolated MTs in\na liquid environment. Consequently, studying nanomechanical properties of MTs\nmay give useful information for future applications to diagnostic and\ntherapeutic technologies involving non-invasive externally applied physical\nfields. For example, electromagnetic fields or high intensity ultrasound can be\nused therapeutically avoiding harmful side effects of chemotherapeutic agents\nor classical radiation therapy.\n", "  We report the structural and transport properties of LaNiO3 thin films\nprepared by pulsed laser deposition technique. To understand the effects of\nfilm thickness, lattice mismatch and grain size on transport properties,\nvarious oriented substrates were used for deposition, including\nsingle-crystalline SrLaAlO4 (001), SrTiO3 (100) and LaAlO3 (100). To achieve a\nhigh quality LaNiO3 thin films, the vital parameters (such as laser fluence,\nsubstrate temperature, oxygen pressure, and deposition time) were optimized.\nThe best quality films are found to be well textured samples with good\ncrystalline properties.\n", "  Orbifold equivalence is a notion of symmetry that does not rely on group\nactions. Among other applications, it leads to surprising connections between\nhitherto unrelated singularities. While the concept can be defined in a very\ngeneral category-theoretic language, we focus on the most explicit setting in\nterms of matrix factorisations, where orbifold equivalences arise from defects\nwith special properties. Examples are relatively difficult to construct, but we\nuncover some structural features that distinguish orbifold equivalences -- most\nnotably a finite perturbation expansion. We use those properties to devise a\nsearch algorithm, then present some new examples including Arnold\nsingularities.\n", "  We extend a previously introduced semi-analytical representation of a\ndecomposition of CA dynamics in arbitrary dimensions and neighborhood schemes\nvia the use of certain universal maps in which CA rule vectors are derivable\nfrom the equivalent of superpotentials. The results justify the search for\nalternative analog models of computation and their possible physical\nconnections.\n", "  We present our recent results on temperature behaviour of magnetization\nobserved in Ni_47Mn_39In_14 Heusler alloys. Three regions can be distinguished\nin the M-T diagram: (I) low temperature martensitic phase (with the Curie\ntemperature T_CM = 140 K), (II) intermediate mixed phase (with the critical\ntemperature T_MS = 230 K) exhibiting a reentrant like behavior (between T_CM\nand T_MS) and (III) high temperature austenitic phase (with the Curie\ntemperature T_CA = 320 K) exhibiting a rather wide plateau region (between T_MS\nand T_CA). By arguing that powerful structural transformations, causing drastic\nmodifications of the domain structure in alloys, would also trigger strong\nfluctuations of the order parameters throughout the entire M-T diagram, we were\nable to successfully fit all the data by incorporating Gaussian fluctuations\n(both above and below the above three critical temperatures) into the\nGinzburg-Landau scenario.\n", "  We report some unusual magnetic properties observed in CoFe2O4 based\nferrofluid (with an average particle size of D = 6 nm). More precisely, in\naddition to the low-field ferromagnetic (FM) phase transition with an intrinsic\nCurie temperature T_Cb=350K, a second phase transition with an extrinsic Curie\ntemperature T_Cw = 266K emerges at higher (saturating) magnetic field. The\ntransitions meet at the crossover point T_cr = 210 K. The origin of the second\ntransition is attributed to magnetic field induced proximity type interaction\nbetween FM particles through non-FM layers.\n", "  The need to forecast solar irradiation at a specific location over short-time\nhorizons has acquired immense importance. In this paper, we report on analyses\nresults involving statistical and machine learning techniques to predict hourly\nhorizontal solar irradiation at one-hour ahead horizon using data sets from\nthree different cities in the U.S. with different climatic conditions. A simple\nforecast approach that assumes consecutive days are identical serves as a\nbaseline model against which to compare competing forecast alternatives. One\napproach is to use seasonal ARIMA models. Surprisingly, such models are found\nto be poorer than the simple forecast. To account for seasonal variability and\ncapture short-term fluctuations, cloud cover is an obvious variable to\nconsider. Monthly models with cloud cover as regressor were found to outperform\nthe simple forecast model. More sophisticated lagged moving average (LMX)\nmodels were also evaluated, and one of the variants, LMX2, identified at\nmonthly time scales, proved to be the best choice. Finally, the LMX2 model is\ncompared against artificial neural network (ANN) models and the latter proved\nto be more accurate. The companion paper will present algorithms and results of\nhow such models can be used for 4-hr rolling horizon and 24-hr ahead\nforecasting.\n", "  We present photometric and polarimetric observations of a new magnetic\ncataclysmic variable, presumably a polar, USNO-A2.0 0825-18396733. The\nphotometric observations were carried out with the SAO RAS Zeiss-1000\ntelescope, and the polarimetry was performed with the 6-m BTA telescope. The\nredefined orbital period P = 0:d08481(2); the brightness of the system varied\nfrom 17:5 to 20:0 in the Rc filter. Polarimetric observations of the object in\nthe V filter revealed strong variable circular polarization: -2% to over -31%.\nThis indicates that the variable USNO-A2.0 0825-18396733 is a polar.\n", "  We present the prototype module of our extendible and robust multichannel\nSQUID magnetometer system. A multi-module arrangement can be implemented by\nusing up to 7 modules. It is intended for high-precision measurements of\nbiomagnetism and spin precession. Further demanding applications are\nmagnetorelaxometry and ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ULF NMR),\nwhere pulsed fields of up to 100 mT are typically applied. The system is\noperated inside the Berlin Magnetically Shielded Room and equipped with 18\nmagnetometers consisting of niobium (Nb) wire-wound pick-up coils. A total of\n16 small pick-up coils with 17.1 mm diameter form a regular grid with\nindividual channels arranged to ensure system sensitivity covers all three\northogonal spatial directions. Two large hexagonal pick-up coils with an\nequivalent diameter of 74.5 mm sensitive in z-direction surround the grid at\ntwo different heights and are suitable for the detection of deep sources. Each\ncoil is connected to the input of a thin-film Nb SQUID current sensor via a\ndetachable superconducting contact. The SQUIDs are equipped with integrated\ninput current limiters. Feedback into the pick-up coils minimizes crosstalk\nbetween channels. The current sensor chip package includes a superconducting\nshield of Nb. The field distortion of the prototype and a multi-module\narrangement was analysed by numerical simulation. The measured noise of the\nsmall magnetometers was between 0.6 and 1.5 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$, and well below 1\nfT/Hz$^{1/2}$ for the large ones. Using a software gradiometer, we achieved a\nminimum noise level of 0.54 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$. We performed ULF NMR experiments,\nverifying the system's robustness against pulsed fields, and\nmagnetoencephalographgy (MEG) on somatosensory evoked neuronal activity. The\nlow noise performance of our 18-channel prototype enabled the detection of\nhigh-frequency components at around 1 kHz by MEG.\n", "  A finite photonic lattice with two bands and a random gap is considered.\nUsing a two-dimensional Dirac equation, the effect of a random sign of the\nDirac mass is studied numerically. The edge state at the sample boundary has a\nstrong influence on the electromagnetic field and its polarization inside the\nsample. The creation of edge states through a randomly fluctuating sign of the\nDirac mass defeats Anderson localization and allows the electromagnetic field\nto distribute over the entire sample. The width of the distribution increases\nwith an increasing gap due to increasing sharpness of the edge states. These\nresults are compared with those of a random one-band Helmholtz equation. In\ncontrast to the Dirac model, the one-band model displays a clear signature of\nAnderson localization.\n", "  This paper provides a general introduction to the problem of image\nreconstruction from interferometric data. A simple model of the interferometric\nobservables is given and the issues arising from sparse Fourier data are\ndiscussed. The effects of various regularizations are described. In the\nproposed general framework, most existing algorithms can be understood. For an\nastronomer, such an understanding is crucial not only for selecting and using\nan algorithm but also to ensure correct interpretation of the resulting image.\n", "  Core-collapse supernovae are the first polluters of heavy elements in the\ngalactic history. As such, it is important to study the nuclear compositions of\ntheir ejecta, and understand their dependence on the progenitor structure\n(e.g., mass, compactness, metallicity). Here, we present a detailed\nnucleosynthesis study based on two long-term, two-dimensional core-collapse\nsupernova simulations of a 11.2 M$_{\\odot}$ and a 17.0 M$_{\\odot}$ star. We\nfind that in both models nuclei well beyond the iron group (up to $Z \\approx\n44$) can be produced, and discuss in detail also the nucleosynthesis of the\np-nuclei $^{92,94}$Mo and $^{96,98}$Ru. While we observe the production of\n$^{92}$Mo and $^{94}$Mo in slightly neutron-rich conditions in both\nsimulations, $^{96,98}$Ru can only be produced efficiently via the\n$\\nu$p-process. Furthermore, the production of Ru in the $\\nu$p-process heavily\ndepends on the presence of very proton-rich material in the ejecta. This\ndisentanglement of production mechanisms has interesting consequences when\ncomparing to the abundance ratios between these isotopes in the solar system\nand in presolar grains.\n", "  The paper formulates a principal positions of non-Hermitian models with\n$\\gamma_5$-mass extensions, which often be ignored in some investigations for\nthis subject. In fact in this case Hamiltonians contain not only Hermitian\nmasses $m_1$, but also contribution from anti-Hermitian components of fermion\nmasses $m_2$. Main misunderstanding a number of papers is consist in using of\nthis model for any values of fermion masses for fixed values of $m_1$ and\n$m_2$. However the basis appearing of two parameters masses may be undertaken a\nsimple estimation for determination maximal permissible value of fermion mass\n$M={m_1}^2/2m_2$ which may be used for this model. Easy to see that $M$ becomes\ninfinite and hence experimentally does not observable only in Dirac's limit,\nwhen the non-Hermitian mass fully is disappearing. In particular the equality\n$m_1=m_2$ can be realized only in two cases when $m_1=m_2=0$ and $m_1=m_2=2M$.\nMoreover in the second case the question is about the possibility existence a\nnumber of new fermions masses which are equal to the masses of particles\nStandard Model(SM) but when they have the non-Hermitian characteristics. In\nthis case the paradox of the \"two masses\" takes place and its solution may be\ndone only in suggested model with a maximal mass. Appearing particles can be\nconsidered as some new particles arising beyond SM. The unusual properties of\nthese particles allow also to consider their as possible candidates in\nstructure of dark matter.\n", "  Observations of 25 Ori much expand the picture derived of other early-type Be\nstars with BRITE and SMEI. Two instead of one difference frequencies rule the\nvariability: (a) The lower one, 0.0129 c/d, is the frequency of events with\nfull amplitudes of 100-200 mmag which may signal mass loss possibly driven by\nthe higher one, 0.1777 c/d. (b) Much of the entire power spectrum is a tightly\nwoven network of combination frequencies: (i) Below 0.25\\,c/d, numerous\nfrequencies are difference frequencies. (ii) Many frequencies above 2.5 c/d can\nbe represented as sum frequencies and in a few cases as harmonics. (iii) Many\nfrequencies between 1.1 and 1.75\\,c/d can be portrayed as parents of\ncombination frequencies. The number and fraction of combination frequencies\nincreases steeply with decreasing amplitude and and accuracy of the frequency\nmatching.\n", "  DFT is used throughout nanoscience, especially when modeling spin-dependent\nproperties that are important in spintronics. But standard quantum chemical\nmethods (both CCSD(T) and self-consistent semilocal density functional\ncalculations) fail badly for the spin adiabatic energy difference in Fe(II)\nspin-crossover complexes. We show that all-electron fixed-node diffusion Monte\nCarlo can be converged at significant computational cost, and that the B3LYP\nsingle-determinant has sufficiently accurate nodes, providing benchmarks for\nthese systems. We also find that density-corrected DFT, using Hartree-Fock\ndensities (HF-DFT), greatly improves accuracy and reduces dependence on\napproximations for these calculations. The small gap in the self-consistent DFT\ncalculations for the high-spin state is consistent with this. For the spin\nadiabatic energy differences in these complexes, HF-DFT is both accurate and\nreliable, and we make a strong prediction for the Fe-Porphyrin complex. The\n\"parameter-dilemma\" of needing different amounts of mixing for different\nproperties is eliminated by HF-DFT.\n", "  We study the time evolution of the Optical Spin Hall Effect (OSHE), which\noccurs when exciton-polaritons undergo resonant Rayleigh scattering. The\nresulting spin pattern in momentum space is quantified by calculating the\ndegree of circular polarization of the momentum space image for each point in\ntime. We find the degree of circular polarization performing oscillations,\nwhich can be described within the framework of the pseudospin model by Kavokin\net al. (Ref. 1).\n", "  We have conceived and implemented a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA)\ncode for the optimisation of an array of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov\nTelescopes (IACTs). The algorithm takes as input a series of cost functions\n(metrics) each describing a different objetive of the optimisation (such as\neffective area, angular resolution, etc.), all of which are expressed in terms\nof the relative position of the telescopes in the plane. The output of the\nalgorithm is a family of geometrical arrangements which correspond to the\ncomplete set of solutions to the array optimisation problem, and differ from\neach other according to the relative weight given to each of the (maybe\nconflicting) objetives of the optimisation. Since the algorithm works with\nparallel optimisation it admits as many cost functions as desired, and can\nincorporate constraints such as budget (cost cap) for the array and topological\nlimitations of the terrain, like geographical accidents where telescopes cannot\nbe installed. It also admits different types of telescopes (hybrid arrays) and\nthe number of telescopes of each type can be treated as a parameter to be\noptimised - constrained, for example, by the cost of each type or the energy\nrange of interest. The purpose of the algorithm, which converges fast to\noptimised solutions (if compared to the time for a complete Monte Carlo\nSimulation of a single configuration), is to provide a tool to investigate the\nfull parameter space of possible geometries, and help in designing complex\narrays. It does not substitute a detailed Monte Carlo study, but aims to guide\nit. In the examples of arrays shown here we have used as metrics simple\nheuristic expressions describing the fundamentals of the IAC technique, but\nthese input functions can be made as detailed or complex as desired for a given\nexperiment.\n", "  Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with non-vanishing cosmological constant coupled to\nLiouville theory is considered as a non-critical string on $d$ dimensional flat\nspacetime. It is discussed how the presence of cosmological constant yields\nadditional constraints on the parameter space of the theory, even when the\nconformal anomaly is independent of the cosmological constant. Such constraints\nagree with the necessary conditions for the tachyon field to be a primary\n--prelogarithmic-- operator of the worldsheet conformal field theory. Thus, the\nlinearized tachyon field equation allows to impose the diagonal condition for\nthe interaction term. We analyze the neutralization of the Liouville mode\ninduced by the coupling to the Jackiw-Teitelboim Lagrangian. The free field\nprescription leads to obtain explicit expressions for three-point correlation\nfunctions for the case of vanishing cosmological constant in terms of a product\nof Shapiro-Virasoro integrals. This is a consequence of the mentioned\nneutralization effect.\n", "  We consider the Cauchy problem for the scalar wave equation in the Kerr\ngeometry for smooth initial data supported outside the event horizon. We prove\nthat the solutions decay in time in L^\\infty_loc. The proof is based on a\nrepresentation of the solution as an infinite sum over the angular momentum\nmodes, each of which is an integral of the energy variable on the real line.\nThis integral representation involves solutions of the radial and angular ODEs\nwhich arise in the separation of variables.\n", "  We prove that the Schwarzschild black hole is linearly stable under\nelectromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Our method is to show that for\nspin $s=1$ or $s=2$, solutions of the Teukolsky equation with smooth, compactly\nsupported initial data outside the event horizon, decay in $L^\\infty_{loc}$.\n", "  With a view towards models of quantum computation and/or the interpretation\nof linear logic, we define a functional language where all functions are linear\noperators by construction. A small step operational semantic (and hence an\ninterpreter/simulator) is provided for this language in the form of a term\nrewrite system. The linear-algebraic lambda-calculus hereby constructed is\nlinear in a different (yet related) sense to that, say, of the linear\nlambda-calculus. These various notions of linearity are discussed in the\ncontext of quantum programming languages. KEYWORDS: quantum lambda-calculus,\nlinear lambda-calculus, $\\lambda$-calculus, quantum logics.\n", "  We provide algebraic criteria for the unitarity of linear quantum cellular\nautomata, i.e. one dimensional quantum cellular automata. We derive these both\nby direct combinatorial arguments, and by adding constraints into the model\nwhich do not change the quantum cellular automata's computational power. The\nconfigurations we consider have finite but unbounded size.\n"]}
