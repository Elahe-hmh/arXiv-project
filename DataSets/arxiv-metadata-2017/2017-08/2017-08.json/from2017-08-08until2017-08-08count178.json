In particular, we extend Lichnerowicz-Poisson\ncohomology and Koszul-Brylinski homology to the realm of extended Poisson\nmanifolds; we establish a sufficient criterion for these to be finite\ndimensional; we describe how homology and cohomology are related through the\nEvens-Lu-Weinstein duality module; and we describe a duality on\nKoszul-Brylinski homology, which generalizes the Serre duality of Dolbeault\ncohomology.\n", "  The search for a Standard Model Higgs boson with the $H\\to WW^\\ast\\to\n\\ell\\ell + E_{\\rm T}^{\\rm miss}$ decay and the application of a full-jet veto\nyields a strong sensitivity in the mass range $130<m_H<200$ GeV. One of the\nresidual backgrounds is related to processes involving top quarks. A method for\nthe extraction of top backgrounds is evaluated at the parton and hadronic\nlevels based on the data-driven extraction of the jet veto survival\nprobability. The uncertainty of the proposed method is about 15%.\n", "  We introduce the notion of Glanon groupoids, which are Lie groupoids equipped\nwith multiplicative generalized complex structures. It combines symplectic\ngroupoids, holomorphic Lie groupoids and holomorphic Poisson groupoids into a\nunified framework. Their infinitesimal, Glanon Lie algebroids are studied. We\nprove that there is a bijection between Glanon Lie algebroids and source-simply\nconnected and source-connected Glanon groupoids. As a consequence, we recover\nvarious integration theorem and obtain the integration theorem for holomorphic\nPoisson groupoids.\n", "  A celebrated theorem of Kapranov states that the Atiyah class of the tangent\nbundle of a complex manifold $X$ makes $T_X[-1]$ into a Lie algebra object in\n$D^+(X)$, the bounded below derived category of coherent sheaves on $X$.\nFurthermore Kapranov proved that, for a K\\\"ahler manifold $X$, the Dolbeault\nresolution $\\Omega^{\\bullet-1}(T_X^{1,0})$ of $T_X[-1]$ is an $L_\\infty$\nalgebra. In this paper, we prove that Kapranov's theorem holds in much wider\ngenerality for vector bundles over Lie pairs. Given a Lie pair $(L,A)$, i.e. a\nLie algebroid $L$ together with a Lie subalgebroid $A$, we define the Atiyah\nclass $\\alpha_E$ of an $A$-module $E$ (relative to $L$) as the obstruction to\nthe existence of an $A$-compatible $L$-connection on $E$. We prove that the\nAtiyah classes $\\alpha_{L/A}$ and $\\alpha_E$ respectively make $L/A[-1]$ and\n$E[-1]$ into a Lie algebra and a Lie algebra module in the bounded below\nderived category $D^+(\\mathcal{A})$, where $\\mathcal{A}$ is the abelian\ncategory of left $\\mathcal{U}(A)$-modules and $\\mathcal{U}(A)$ is the universal\nenveloping algebra of $A$. Moreover, we produce a homotopy Leibniz algebra and\na homotopy Leibniz module stemming from the Atiyah classes of $L/A$ and $E$,\nand inducing the aforesaid Lie structures in $D^+(\\mathcal{A})$.\n", "  We have studied the $\\nu=5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state in a\ndensity-tunable sample at extremely low electron densities. For the densities\naccessed in our experiment, the Landau level mixing parameter $\\kappa$ spans\nthe $2.52<\\kappa<2.82$ range. In the vicinity of $5.8 \\times 10^{10}$~cm$^{-2}$\nor $\\kappa = 2.6$ an anomalously large change in the density dependence of the\nenergy gap is observed. Possible origins of such an anomaly are discussed,\nincluding a topological phase transition in the $\\nu=5/2$ fractional quantum\nHall state.\n", "  We present measurements of the anisotropic galaxy clustering from the Data\nRelease 9 (DR9) CMASS sample of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic\nSurvey (BOSS). We analyze the broad-range shape of the monopole and quadrupole\ncorrelation functions to obtain constraints, at the effective redshift $z=0.57$\nof the sample, on the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$, the angular-diameter\ndistance $D_A(z)$, the normalized growth rate $f(z)\\sigma_8(z)$, the physical\nmatter density $\\Omega_m h^2$, and the biased amplitude of matter fluctuation\nb\\sigma_8(z). We obtain {$H(0.57)$, $D_A(0.57)$, $f(0.57)\\sigma_8(0.57)$,\n$\\Omega_m h^2$, $b\\sigma_8(0.57)$} = {$87.6_{-6.8}^{+6.7}$, $1396\\pm73$,\n$0.126_{-0.010}^{+0.008}$, $1.19\\pm0.14$, $0.428\\pm0.066$} and their covariance\nmatrix as well. The parameters which are not well constrained by our of galaxy\nclustering analysis are marginalized over with wide flat priors. Since no\npriors from other data sets (i.e., CMB) are adopted and no dark energy models\nare assumed, our results from BOSS CMASS galaxy clustering alone may be\ncombined with other data sets, i.e. CMB, SNe, lensing or other galaxy\nclustering data to constrain the parameters of a given cosmological model. We\nshow that the major power on constraining dark energy from the anisotropic\ngalaxy clustering signal, as compared to the angular-averaged one (monopole),\narises from including the normalized growth rate $f(z)\\sigma_8(z)$. In the case\nof the wCDM cosmological model our single-probe CMASS constraints, combined\nwith CMB (WMAP9+SPT), yield a value for the dark energy equation of state\nparameter of $w=-0.90\\pm0.11$. Therefore, it is important to include\n$f(z)\\sigma_8(z)$ while investigating the nature of dark energy with current\nand upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys.\n", "  Drawing on a large database of publicly announced R&D alliances, we\nempirically investigate the evolution of R&D networks and the process of\nalliance formation in several manufacturing sectors over a 24-year period\n(1986-2009). Our goal is to empirically evaluate the temporal and sectoral\nrobustness of a large set of network indicators, thus providing a more complete\ndescription of R&D networks with respect to the existing literature. We find\nthat most network properties are not only invariant across sectors, but also\nindependent of the scale of aggregation at which they are observed, and we\nhighlight the presence of core-periphery architectures in explaining some\nproperties emphasized in previous empirical studies (e.g. asymmetric degree\ndistributions and small worlds). In addition, we show that many properties of\nR&D networks are characterized by a rise-and-fall dynamics with a peak in the\nmid-nineties. We find that such dynamics is driven by mechanisms of\naccumulative advantage, structural homophily and multiconnectivity. In\nparticular, the change from the \"rise\" to the \"fall\" phase is associated to a\nstructural break in the importance of multiconnectivity.\n", "  In the standard thin disc formalism the dimensionless $\\alpha$ parameter is\nusually assumed to be constant. However, there are good theoretical reasons for\nbelieving, as well as evidence from simulations, that $\\alpha$ is dependent on\nintrinsic disc properties. In this paper we analyse the conditions for the\nstability of a thin accretion disc in which $\\alpha$ is a function of the\nmagnetic Prandtl number, the ratio of collisional viscosity to resistivity. In\nthe inner disc, where the free electron opacity and radiation viscosity\ndominate, the disc is unstable if $\\alpha$ is proportional to the magnetic\nPrandtl number with an exponent, $n$, and $6/13<n<10/3$. This is within the\nrange of values for the power-law index found in MHD simulations with simple\nenergetics. We calculate the evolution of the unstable disc within the $\\alpha$\nformalism and show that the physically accessible solutions form a limit cycle,\nanalogous to the behaviour seen in recurrent dwarf novae. It is noteworthy that\nthe time-dependent global behaviour of the instability results in cyclic\nheating of the inner section of the disc, when parameters appropriate for an\nX-ray binary system are used. We calculate a model spectrum of the disc in the\nflaring and quiescent states and show that the behaviour is compatible with\nX-ray observations of the thermal accretion disc in flaring X-ray binary\nsystems.\n", "  Holographic particle image velocimetry allows tracking particle trajectories\nin time and space by means of holography. However, the drawback of the\ntechnique is that in the three-dimensional particle distribution reconstructed\nfrom a hologram, the individual particles can hardly be resolved due to the\nsuperimposed out-of-focus signal from neighboring particles. We demonstrate\nhere a three-dimensional volumetric deconvolution applied to the reconstructed\nwavefront which results in resolving all particles simultaneously in\nthree-dimensions. Moreover, we apply the three-dimensional volumetric\ndeconvolution to reconstructions of a time-dependent sequence of holograms of\nan ensemble of polystyrene spheres moving in water. From each hologram we\nsimultaneously resolve all particles in the ensemble in three dimensions and\nfrom the sequence of holograms we obtain the time-resolved trajectories of\nindividual polystyrene spheres.\n", "  We present a new methodology to generate mock halo or galaxy catalogues,\nwhich have accurate clustering properties, nearly indistinguishable from full\n$N$-body solutions, in terms of the one-point, two-point, and three-point\nstatistics. In particular, the agreement is remarkable, within $1\\%$ up to\n$k=0.55$ $h$Mpc$^{-1}$ and down to $r=10$ $h^{-1}$Mpc, for the power spectrum\nand two-point correlation function respectively, while the bispectrum agrees in\ngeneral within $20\\%$ for different scales and shapes. Our approach is based on\nthe Zel'dovich approximation, however, effectively including with the simple\nprescriptions the missing physical ingredients, and stochastic scale-dependent,\nnon-local and nonlinear biasing contributions. The computing time and memory\nrequired to produce one mock is similar to that using the log-normal model.\nWith high accuracy and efficiency, the effective Zel'dovich approximation mocks\n(EZmocks) provide a reliable and practical method to produce massive mock\ngalaxy catalogues for the analysis of large-scale structure measurements.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to confirm in new concrete examples that the\nsemiclassical entropy of a three-dimensional Lifshitz black hole can be\nrecovered through an anisotropic generalization of the Cardy formula derived\nfrom the growth of the number of states of a boundary non-relativistic field\ntheory. The role of the ground state in the bulk is played by the corresponding\nLifshitz soliton obtained by a double Wick rotation. In order to achieve this\ntask, we consider a scalar field nonminimally coupled to new massive gravity\nfor which we study different classes of Lifshitz black holes as well as their\nrespective solitons, including new solutions for a dynamical exponent z=3. The\nmasses of the black holes and solitons are computed using the quasilocal\nformulation of conserved charges recently proposed by Gim, Kim, Kulkarni and Yi\nand based on the off-shell extension of the ADT formalism. We confirm the\nanisotropic Cardy formula for each of these examples, providing a stronger base\nfor its general validity. Consistently, the first law of thermodynamics\ntogether with a Smarr formula are also verified.\n", "  We prove a nonlinear steepest descent theorem for Riemann-Hilbert problems\nwith Carleson jump contours and jump matrices of low regularity and slow decay.\nWe illustrate the theorem by deriving the long-time asymptotics for the mKdV\nequation in the similarity sector for initial data with limited decay and\nregularity.\n", "  The speed of light in vacuum, one of the most important and precisely\nmeasured natural constants, is fixed by convention to $c=299 792 458$ m/s.\nAdvanced theories predict possible deviations from this universal value, or\neven quantum fluctuations of $c$. Combining arguments from quantum parameter\nestimation theory and classical general relativity, we here establish\nrigorously the existence of lower bounds on the uncertainty to which the speed\nof light in vacuum can be determined in a given region of space-time, subject\nto several reasonable restrictions. They provide a novel perspective on the\nexperimental falsifiability of predictions for the quantum fluctuations of\nspace-time.\n", "  We study the nanoscale behaviour of the density of a simple fluid in the\nvicinity of an equilibrium contact line for a wide range of Young contact\nangles between 40 and 135 degrees. Cuts of the density profile at various\npositions along the contact line are presented, unravelling the apparent\nstep-wise increase of the film height profile observed in contour plots of the\ndensity. The density profile is employed to compute the normal pressure acting\non the substrate along the contact line. We observe that for the full range of\ncontact angles, the maximal normal pressure cannot solely be predicted by the\ncurvature of the adsorption film height, but is instead softened -- likely by\nthe width of the liquid-vapour interface. Somewhat surprisingly however, the\nadsorption film height profile can be predicted to a very good accuracy by the\nDerjaguin-Frumkin disjoining pressure obtained from planar computations, as was\nfirst shown in [Nold et al., Phys. Fluids, 26, 072001, 2014] for contact angles\nless than 90 degrees, a result which here we show to be valid for the full\nrange of contact angles. This suggests that while two-dimensional effects\ncannot be neglected for the computation of the normal pressure distribution\nalong the substrate, one-dimensional planar computations of the\nDerjaguin-Frumkin disjoining pressure are sufficient to accurately predict the\nadsorption height profile.\n", "  We have analyzed in detail four and five point functions of the string theory\namplitudes, including a closed string Ramond-Ramond (RR) in an asymmetric\npicture and either two or three transverse scalar fields in both IIA and IIB.\nThe complete forms of these S-matrices are derived and these asymmetric\nS-matrices are also compared with their own symmetric results. This leads us to\nexplore two different kinds of bulk singularity structures as well as various\nnew couplings in asymmetric picture of the amplitude in type II string theory.\nAll order $\\alpha'$ higher derivative corrections to these new couplings have\nbeen discovered as well. Several remarks for these two new bulk singularity\nstructures and for contact interactions of the S-Matrix have also been made.\n", "  We construct one-parameter families of solutions to the\nEinstein--Klein--Gordon equations bifurcating off the Kerr solution such that\nthe underlying family of spacetimes are each an asymptotically flat,\nstationary, axisymmetric, black hole spacetime, and such that the corresponding\nscalar fields are non-zero and time-periodic. An immediate corollary is that\nfor these Klein--Gordon masses, the Kerr family is not asymptotically stable as\na solution to the Einstein--Klein--Gordon equations.\n", "  An important consequence which comes from noncommutativity (NC) is\nundoubtedly the energy density characterized by a microscopic free parameter;\nindeed a Trans-Planckian parameter. However, its functional form is an\ninteresting and useful equation which can be analyzed in astrophysical\nscenarios giving now astrophysical constraints. In this sense, this paper is\ndevoted to explore the astrophysical consequences of an energy density with the\nsame functional form of NC; mainly in stellar dynamics and rotation curves of\ngalaxies. We start exploring toy models of stars with incompressible and\npolytropic fluids respectively, with the addition and coexistence with this new\nfluid. In both cases, we propose an appropriate constriction based on the\ndifference between a correct and an anomalous behavior. As a complement, we\nexplore the rotation curves of galaxies assuming that the halo is a fluid with\nthe same characteristic of a NC equation, obtaining the range of values for the\nfree parameter through the analysis of eighteen LSB galaxies. Our results are\ncompared with traditional models studied in literature like Pseudoisothermal\n(PISO), Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Burkert and WaveDM dark matter models.\nFinally, we have computed the surface density, $\\rho_i r_i$ for each dark\nmatter model, where $i$ is for PISO, NFW, Burkert, WaveDM and NC macroscopic\nversion. In the later case, following the results found using SPARC galaxy\ncatalog, we have found a theoretical value of $116.97 M_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ while\nthe data analysis gives us a value of $144.21 M_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$.\n", "  The group $Diff$ of diffeomorphisms of the circle is an infinite dimensional\nanalog of the real semisimple Lie groups $U(p,q)$, $Sp(2n,R)$, $SO^*(2n)$; the\nspace $\\Xi$ of univalent functions is an analog of the corresponding classical\ncomplex Cartan domains. We present explicit formulas for realizations of\nhighest weight representations of $Diff$ in the space of holomorphic\nfunctionals on $\\Xi$, reproducing kernels on $\\Xi$ determining inner products,\nand expressions ('canonical cocycles') replacing spherical functions.\n", "  Interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are strongly affected by\nthe absorption of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons in the interstellar medium\n(ISM), yet the branching ratio between ionization and fragmentation is poorly\nstudied. This is crucial for the stability and charge state of PAHs in the ISM\nin different environments, affecting in turn the chemistry, the energy balance,\nand the contribution of PAHs to the extinction and emission curves. We studied\nthe interaction of PAH cations with VUV photons in the 7-20 eV range from the\nsynchrotron SOLEIL beamline, DESIRS. We recorded by action spectroscopy the\nrelative intensities of photo-fragmentation and photo-ionization for a set of\neight PAH cations ranging in size from 14 to 24 carbon atoms, with different\nstructures. At photon energies below ~13.6 eV fragmentation dominates for the\nsmaller species, while for larger species ionization is immediately competitive\nafter the second ionization potential (IP). At higher photon energies, all\nspecies behave similarly, the ionization yield gradually increases, leveling\noff between 0.8 and 0.9 at ~18 eV. Among isomers, PAH structure appears to\nmainly affect the fragmentation cross section, but not the ionization cross\nsection. We also measured the second IP for all species and the third IP for\ntwo of them, all are in good agreement with theoretical ones confirming that\nPAH cations can be further ionized in the diffuse ISM. Determining actual PAH\ndication abundances in the ISM will require detailed modeling. Our measured\nphoto-ionization yields for several PAH cations provide a necessary ingredient\nfor such models.\n", "  The canonical trace and the Wodzicki residue on classical pseudodifferential\noperators on a closed manifold are characterised by their locality and shown to\nbe preserved under lifting to the universal covering as a result of their local\nfeature. As a consequence, we lift a class of spectral $\\zeta$-invariants using\nlifted defect formulae which express discrepancies of $\\zeta$-regularised\ntraces in terms of Wodzicki residues. We derive Atiyah's $L^2$-index theorem as\nan instance of the $\\mathbb Z_2$-graded generalisation of the canonical lift of\nspectral $\\zeta$-invariants and we show that certain lifted spectral\n$\\zeta$-invariants for geometric operators are integrals of Pontryagin and\nChern forms.\n", "  Noninteracting bosons were proposed to be used for a demonstration of\nquantum-computing supremacy in a boson-sampling setup. A similar demonstration\nwith fermions would require that the fermions are initially prepared in an\nentangled state. I suggest that pairwise entanglement of fermions would be\nsufficient for this purpose. Namely, it is shown that computing multi-particle\nscattering amplitudes for fermions entangled pairwise in groups of four\nsingle-particle states is #P hard. In linear algebra, such amplitudes are\nexpressed as exterior products of two-forms of rank two. In particular, a\npermanent of a NxN matrix may be expressed as an exterior product of N^2\ntwo-forms of rank two in dimension 2N^2, which establishes the #P-hardness of\nthe latter.\n", "  In this paper, we take cosmological constant as a thermodynamical pressure\nand it's conjugate quantity as a thermodynamical volume. This expression help\nus to investigate the phase transition and holographic heat engine. So, in\norder to have Van der Waals fluid behaviour in Horava -Lifshitz (HL) black\nhole, we modified the solution of such black hole with some cosmology ansatz.\nAlso from holographic heat engine, we obtain Carnot efficiency for the HL black\nhole. The phase transition of the system lead us to investigate the stability\ncondition for the corresponding black hole. In that case, we show that the\nstability exist only in special region of black hole.\n", "  The concept of classical $f$-divergences gives a unified framework to\nconstruct and study measures of dissimilarity of probability distributions;\nspecial cases include the relative entropy and the R\\'enyi divergences. Various\nquantum versions of this concept, and more narrowly, the concept of R\\'enyi\ndivergences, have been introduced in the literature with applications in\nquantum information theory; most notably Petz' quasi-entropies (standard\n$f$-divergences), Matsumoto's maximal $f$-divergences, measured\n$f$-divergences, and sandwiched and $\\alpha$-$z$-R\\'enyi divergences.\n  In this paper we give a systematic overview of the various concepts of\nquantum $f$-divergences with a main focus on their monotonicity under quantum\noperations, and the implications of the preservation of a quantum\n$f$-divergence by a quantum operation. In particular, we compare the standard\nand the maximal $f$-divergences regarding their ability to detect the\nreversibility of quantum operations. We also show that these two quantum\n$f$-divergences are strictly different for non-commuting operators unless $f$\nis a polynomial, and obtain some analogous partial results for the relation\nbetween the measured and the standard $f$-divergences.\n  We also study the monotonicity of the $\\alpha$-$z$-R\\'enyi divergences under\nthe special class of bistochastic maps that leave one of the arguments of the\nR\\'enyi divergence invariant, and determine domains of the parameters\n$\\alpha,z$ where monotonicity holds, and where the preservation of the\n$\\alpha$-$z$-R\\'enyi divergence implies the reversibility of the quantum\noperation.\n", "  We study the phase diagram and finite temperature properties of an integrable\ngeneralization of the one-dimensional super-symmetric t-J model containing\ninteractions explicitly breaking parity-time reversal (PT) symmetries. To this\npurpose, we apply the quantum transfer matrix method which results in a finite\nset of non-linear integral equations. We obtain numerical solutions to these\nequations leading to results for thermodynamic quantities as function of\ntemperature, magnetic field, particle density and staggering parameter.\nStudying the maxima lines of entropy at low but non zero temperature reveals\nthe phase diagram of the model. There are ten different phases which we may\nclassify in terms of the qualitative behaviour of auxiliary functions, closely\nrelated to the dressed energy functions.\n", "  We have experimentally produced rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate in an\noptically-plugged magnetic quadrupole (OPQ) trap. A far blue-detuned focused\nlaser beam with a wavelength of 532 nm is plugged in the center of the magnetic\nquadrupole trap to increase the number of trapped atoms and suppress the\nheating. A radio frequency (RF) evaporative cooling in the magneto-optical\nhybrid trap is applied to decrease the atom temperature into degeneracy. The\natom number of the condensate is $1.2(0.4)\\times10^5$ and the temperature is\nbelow 100 nK. We have also studied characteristic behaviors of the condensate,\nsuch as phase space density (PSD), condensate fraction and anisotropic\nexpansion.\n", "  The group classification problem for the class of (1+1)-dimensional linear\n$r$th order evolution equations is solved for arbitrary values of $r>2$. It is\nshown that a related maximally gauged class of homogeneous linear evolution\nequations is uniformly semi-normalized with respect to linear superposition of\nsolutions and hence the complete group classification can be obtained using the\nalgebraic method. We also compute exact solutions for equations from the class\nunder consideration using Lie reduction and its specific generalizations for\nlinear equations.\n", "  We analyze the time-dependent full-counting statistics of charges transmitted\nthrough a quantum dot in the coherent regime. The generating function for the\ntime-dependent charge transfer statistics is evaluated numerically by\ndiscretizing the Keldysh time contour, which allows us to compute the higher\norder charge and current cumulants. We also develop an analytic expression for\nall order cumulants at any time given as a function of the zeros of the\ngenerating function, finding that the short time universality is due to the\npresence of a dominant single zero. The robustness of the universal features at\nshort times is studied in both the sequential and coherent regimes.\n", "  In this paper, we solve a longstanding open problem for determining the shape\nof an obstacle from the knowledge of the electric (or magnetic) far field\npattern for the scattering of time-harmonic electromagnetic field. We show that\nthe electric (or magnetic) far field patten\n${\\mathbf{E}}^\\infty(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, {\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}_0, k_0)$ (or\n${\\mathbf{H}}^\\infty (\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, {\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}_0, k_0)$),\nknown for all $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\in {\\mathbb S}^2$, where ${\\mathbb {S}}^2$ is\nthe unit sphere in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$, ${\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}_0\\in\n{\\mathbb{S}}^2$ is fixed, $k_0>0$ is fixed, determines the obstacle $D$ and the\nboundary condition on $\\partial D$ uniquely. The boundary condition on\n$\\partial D$ is either the perfect conductor or the impedance one.\n", "  Clustering algorithms for large networks typically use modularity values to\ntest which partitions of the vertex set better represent structure in the data.\nThe modularity of a graph is the maximum modularity of a partition. We consider\nthe modularity of two kinds of graphs.\n  For $r$-regular graphs with a given number of vertices, we investigate the\nminimum possible modularity, the typical modularity, and the maximum possible\nmodularity. In particular, we see that for random cubic graphs the modularity\nis usually in the interval $(0.666, 0.804)$, and for random $r$-regular graphs\nwith large $r$ it usually is of order $1/\\sqrt{r}$. These results help to\nestablish baselines for statistical tests on regular graphs.\n  The modularity of cycles and low degree trees is known to be close to 1: we\nextend these results to `treelike' graphs, where the product of treewidth and\nmaximum degree is much less than the number of edges. This yields for example\nthe (deterministic) lower bound $0.666$ mentioned above on the modularity of\nrandom cubic graphs.\n", "  We investigate the energy spectrum of single layer black phosphorene\nnanoribbons (BPN) by means of a low-energy expansion of a recently proposed\ntight-binding model that describes electron and hole bands close to the Fermi\nenergy level. Using the continuum approach, we propose boundary conditions\nbased on sublattice symmetries for BPN with zigzag and armchair edges and show\nthat our results for the energy spectra exhibit good agreement with those\nobtained by using the five-parameter tight-binding model. We also explore the\nbehaviour of the energy gap versus the nanoribbon width $W$. Our findings\ndemonstrate that band gap of armchair BPNs scale as $1/W^2$, while zigzag BPNs\nexhibit a $1/W$ tendency. We analyse the different possible combinations of the\nzigzag edges that result two-fold degenerate and non-degenerate edge states.\nFurthermore, we obtain expressions for the wave functions and discuss the limit\nof validity of such analytical model.\n", "  We examine the logarithmic corrections to the black hole (BH) entropy product\nformula of outer horizon and inner horizon by taking into account the\n\\emph{effects of statistical quantum fluctuations around the thermal\nequilibrium} and \\emph{via conformal field theory} (CFT). We argue that\nlogarithmic corrections to the BH entropy product formula when calculated using\nCFT and taking into the effects of quantum fluctuations around the thermal\nequilibrium, the formula should \\emph{not be universal} and it should also\n\\emph{not be quantized}. These results have been explicitly checked by giving\nseveral examples.\n", "  In this work we examine loss in ring resonator networks from an \"operator\nvalued phasor addition\" approach (or OVPA approach) which considers the\nmultiple transmission and cross coupling paths of a quantum field traversing a\nring resonator coupled to one or two external waveguide buses. We demonstrate\nthe consistency of our approach by the preservation of the operator commutation\nrelation of the out-coupled bus mode. We compare our results to those obtained\nfrom the conventional quantum Langevin approach which introduces noise\noperators in addition to the quantum Heisenberg equations in order to preserve\ncommutation relations in the presence of loss. It is shown that the two\nexpressions agree in the neighborhood of a cavity resonance where the Langevin\napproach is applicable, whereas the operator valued phasor addition expression\nwe derive is more general, remaining valid far from resonances.\n", "  We use a deformed differential structure to obtain a curved metric by a\ndeformation quantization of the flat space-time. In particular, by setting the\ndeformation parameters to be equal to physical constants we obtain the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model for inflation and a deformed version of\nthe FRW space-time. By calculating classical Einstein-equations for the\nextended space-time we obtain non-trivial solutions. Moreover, in this\nframework we obtain the Moyal-Weyl, i.e. a constant non-commutative space-time,\nby a consistency condition.\n", "  Recent experiments performed on cuprates and alkali-doped fullerides have\ndemonstated that key signatures of superconductivity can be induced above the\nequilibrium critical temperature by optical modulation. These observations in\ndisparate physical systems may indicate a general underlying mechanism.\nMultiple theories have been proposed, but these either consider specific\nfeatures, such as competing instabilities, or focus on conventional BCS-type\nsuperconductivity. Here we show that periodic driving can enhance electron\npairing in strongly-correlated systems. Focusing on the strongly-repulsive\nlimit of the doped Hubbard model, we investigate in-gap, spatially\ninhomogeneous, on-site modulations. We demonstrate that such modulations\nsubstantially reduce electronic hopping, while simultaneously sustaining\nsuper-exchange interactions and pair hopping via driving-induced virtual charge\nexcitations. We calculate real-time dynamics for the one-dimensional case,\nstarting from zero and finite temperature initial states, and show that\nenhanced singlet--pair correlations emerge quickly and robustly in the\nout-of-equilibrium many-body state. Our results reveal a fundamental pairing\nmechanism that might underpin optically induced superconductivity in some\nstrongly correlated quantum materials.\n", "  In conventional NMR experiments, the Zeeman energy gaps of the nuclear spin\nensembles are much lower than their thermal energies, and accordingly exhibit\ntiny polarizations. Generally such low-purity quantum states are devoid of\nquantum entanglement. However, there exist certain nonclassical correlations\nwhich can be observed even in such systems. In this chapter, we discuss three\nsuch quantum correlations, namely, quantum contextuality, Leggett-Garg temporal\ncorrelations, and quantum discord. In each case, we provide a brief theoretical\nbackground and then describe some results from NMR experiments.\n", "  We examine the dynamics of nearest-neighbor bipartite concurrence and total\ncorrelations in the spin-1/2 $XXZ$ model with random fields. We show, starting\nfrom factorized random initial states, that the concurrence can suffer\nentanglement sudden death in the long time limit and therefore may not be a\nuseful indicator of the properties of the system. In contrast, we show that the\ntotal correlations capture the dynamics more succinctly, and further reveal a\nfundamental difference in the dynamics governed by the ergodic versus many-body\nlocalized phases, with the latter exhibiting dynamical oscillations. Finally,\nwe consider an initial state composed of several singlet pairs and show that by\nfixing the correlation properties, while the dynamics do not reveal noticeable\ndifferences between the phases, the long-time values of the correlation\nmeasures appear to indicate the critical region.\n", "  We present an alternative perspective on the see-saw mechanism for the\nneutrino mass, according to which the small neutrino mass is given as a\ndifference of two large masses. This view emerges when an analogue of the\nBogoliubov transformation is used to describe Majorana neutrinos in the\nLagrangian of the see-saw mechanism, which is analogous to the BCS theory. The\nBogoliubov transformation clarifies the natural appearance of Majorana fermions\nwhen C is strongly violated by the right-handed neutrino mass term with good CP\nin the single flavor model. Analyzing typical models with $m_{R}$= $10^{4}$ to\n$10^{15}$ GeV, it is shown that a hitherto unrecognized fine tuning of the\norder $m_{\\nu}/m_{R}=10^{-15}$ to $10^{-26}$ is required to make the commonly\nperceived see-saw mechanism work in a natural setting, namely, when none of\ndimensionless coupling constants are very small.\n", "  Time remains one of the least well understood concepts in physics, most\nnotably in quantum mechanics. A central goal is to find the fundamental limits\nof measuring time. One of the main obstacles is the fact that time is not an\nobservable and thus has to be measured indirectly. Here we explore these\nquestions by introducing a model of time measurements that is complete and\nautonomous. Specifically, our autonomous quantum clock consists of a system out\nof thermal equilibrium --- a prerequisite for any system to function as a clock\n--- powered by minimal resources, namely two thermal baths at different\ntemperatures. Through a detailed analysis of this specific clock model, we find\nthat the laws of thermodynamics dictate a trade-off between the amount of\ndissipated heat and the clock's performance in terms of its accuracy and\nresolution. Our results furthermore imply that a fundamental entropy production\nis associated with the operation of any autonomous quantum clock, assuming that\nquantum machines cannot achieve perfect efficiency at finite power. More\ngenerally, autonomous clocks provide a natural framework for the exploration of\nfundamental questions about time in quantum theory and beyond.\n", "  We theoretically predict that a true bilayer exciton condensate,characterised\nby off-diagonal long range order and global phase coherence, can be created in\none-dimensional solid state electron systems. The mechanism by which this\nhappens is to introduce a single particle hybridization of electron and hole\npopulations, which locks the phase of the relevant mode and hence invalidates\nthe Mermin--Wagner theorem. Electron--hole interactions then amplify this\ntendency towards off-diagonal long range order, enhancing the condensate\nproperties by more than an order of magnitude over the noninteracting limit. We\nshow that the temperatures below which a substantial condensate fraction would\nform could reach hundreds of Kelvin, a benefit of the weak screening in\none-dimensional systems.\n", "  An eigenmode projection technique (EPT) is developed and employed to solve\nproblems of electromagnetic resonance in closed cavities and scattering from\ndiscontinuities in guided-wave structures. The EPT invokes the eigenmodes of a\ncanonical predefined cavity in the solution procedure and uses the expansion of\nthese eigenmodes to solve Maxwell's equations, in conjunction with a convenient\nchoice of port boundary conditions. For closed cavities, resonance frequencies\nof arbitrary-shaped cavities are accurately determined with a robust and\nefficient separation method of spurious modes. For waveguide scattering\nproblems, the EPT is combined with the generalized scattering matrix approach\nto solve problems involving waveguide discontinuities with arbitrary dielectric\nprofiles. Convergence studies show stable solutions for a relatively small\nnumber of expansion modes, and the proposed method shows great robustness over\nconventional solvers in analyzing electromagnetic problems with inhomogeneous\nmaterials.\n", "  Using the transfer matrix method we examine the parametric behavior of the\ntransmittance of TE and TM electromagnetic plane waves propagating in frequency\nrange which are far from the absorption bands of a periodic multilayered\nsystem. We focus on the dependence of the transmittance on the frequency and\nangle of incidence of the electromagnetic wave for the case in which the\nperiodic structure comprises alternating material-metamaterial layers of\nvarious permittivities and permeabilities. A specific example of high\ntransmittance at any angle of incidence in the visible region of the spectrum\nis identified\n", "  We investigate numerically the propagation and the Anderson localization of\nplane waves in a one-dimensional lattice chain, where disorder and saturable\nnonlinearity are simultaneously present. Using a calculation scheme for solving\nthe stationary discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation in the fixed input\ncase, the disorder-averaged logarithmic transmittance and the localization\nlength are calculated in a numerically precise manner. The localization length\nis found to be a nonmonotonic function of the incident wave intensity,\nacquiring a minimum value at a certain finite intensity, due to saturation\neffects. For low incident intensities where the saturation effect is\nineffective, the enhancement of localization due to Kerr-type nonlinearity\noccurs in a way similar to the case without saturation. For sufficiently high\nincident intensities, we find that the localization length is an increasing\nfunction of the incident wave intensity, which implies that localization is\nsuppressed for stronger input intensities, and ultimately approaches a\nsaturation value. This feature is associated with the fact that the nonlinear\nsystem is reduced to an effectively linear one, when either the incident wave\nintensity or the saturation parameter is sufficiently large. We also find that\nthe nonlinear saturation effect is stronger and more pronounced when the energy\nof the incident wave is larger.\n", "  In this paper, we give a positive answer to a challenging open problem for\nrecovering unknown obstacle (which is usually referred to as a scatterer) by\nacoustic wave probe associated to the Helmholtz equation. We show that the\nacoustic scattering amplitude $A(\\beta, {\\alpha}_0, k_0)$, known for all\n${\\beta}\\in {\\mathbb S}^2$, where ${\\mathbb {S}}^2$ is the unit sphere in\n${\\mathbb{R}}^3$, ${{\\alpha}}_0\\in {\\mathbb{S}}^2$ is fixed, $k_0>0$ is fixed,\ndetermines the obstacle $D$ and the boundary condition on $\\partial D$ uniquely\n(The boundary condition on $\\partial D$ is either the Dirichlet, or Neumann, or\nthe impedance one).\n", "  While much is known about the entanglement characteristics of ground states,\nthe properties of reduced thermal density matrices have received significantly\nless attention. Here we investigate the entanglement content of reduced thermal\ndensity matrices for momentum-space bipartitioning in Luttinger liquids using\nanalytical and numerical methods. The low lying part of its spectrum contains\nan \"entanglement gap\", which persists up to temperatures comparable to the\nlevel spacing. With increasing temperature, the low energy modes acquire\ndispersion and resemble to those in the physical Hamiltonian with an enhanced\neffective temperature. The momentum-space entanglement is carried by high\nenergy modes (compared to temperature), featuring a completely flat spectrum.\nThe von-Neumann entropy increases with temperature with a universal Sommerfeld\ncoefficient. The momentum-space entanglement Hamiltonian turns out to be as\nuniversal as the physical Hamiltonian.\n", "  We revisit constraints on dark matter that is charged under a $U(1)$ gauge\ngroup in the dark sector, decoupled from Standard Model forces. We find that\nthe strongest constraints in the literature are subject to a number of\nmitigating factors. For instance, the naive dark matter thermalization\ntimescale in halos is corrected by saturation effects that slow down\nisotropization for modest ellipticities. The weakened bounds uncover\ninteresting parameter space, making models with weak-scale charged dark matter\nviable, even with electromagnetic strength interaction. This also leads to the\nintriguing possibility that dark matter self-interactions within small dwarf\ngalaxies are extremely large, a relatively unexplored regime in current\nsimulations. Such strong interactions suppress heat transfer over scales larger\nthan the dark matter mean free path, inducing a dynamical cutoff length scale\nabove which the system appears to have only feeble interactions. These effects\nmust be taken into account to assess the viability of darkly-charged dark\nmatter. Future analyses and measurements should probe a promising region of\nparameter space for this model.\n", "  While imaging individual atoms can routinely be achieved in high resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy, visualizing the potential distribution of\nindividually charged adsorbates leading to a phase shift of the probing\nelectron wave is still a challenging task. Low-energy electrons (30 - 250 eV)\nare sensitive to localized potential gradients. We employed low-energy electron\nholography to acquire in-line holograms of individual charged impurities on\nfree-standing graphene. By applying an iterative phase retrieval reconstruction\nroutine we recover the potential distribution of the localized charged\nimpurities present on free-standing graphene.\n", "  Spin cat states are superpositions of two or more coherent spin states (CSSs)\nthat are distinctly separated over the Bloch sphere. Additionally, the nuclei\nwith angular momenta greater than 1/2 possess a quadrupolar charge\ndistribution. At the intersection of these two phenomena, we devise a simple\nscheme for generating various types of nuclear spin cat states. The native\nbiaxial electric quadrupole interaction that is readily available in strained\nsolid-state systems plays a key role here. However, the fact that built-in\nstrain cannot be switched off poses a challenge for the stabilization of target\ncat states once they are prepared. We remedy this by abruptly diverting via a\nsingle rotation pulse the state evolution to the neighborhood of the fixed\npoints of the underlying classical Hamiltonian flow. Optimal process parameters\nare obtained as a function of electric field gradient biaxiality and nuclear\nspin angular momentum. The overall procedure is seen to be robust under 5%\ndeviations from optimal values. We show that higher level cat states with four\nsuperposed CSS can also be formed using three rotation pulses. Finally, for\nopen systems subject to decoherence we extract the scaling of cat state\nfidelity damping with respect to the spin quantum number. This reveals rates\ngreater than the dephasing of individual CSSs. Yet, our results affirm that\nthese cat states can preserve their fidelities for practically useful durations\nunder the currently attainable decoherence levels.\n", "  The effect of external static charging on borophenes - 2D boron crystals - is\ninvestigated by using first principles calculations. The influence of the\nexcess negative charge on the stability of the 2D structures is examined using\na very simple analysis of decomposition of the binding energy of a given boron\nlayer into contributions coming from boron atoms that have different\ncoordination numbers. This analysis is important to understand how the local\nneighbourhood of an atom influences the overall stability of the monolayer\nstructure. The decomposition is done for the $\\alpha$-sheet and its related\nfamily of structures. From this analysis, we have found a preference for 2D\nboron crystals with very small or very high charges per atom. The structures\nwith intermediate charges are energetically not favourable. We have also found\na clear preference in terms of binding energy for the experimentally seen\n$\\gamma$-sheet and $\\delta$-sheet structures that is almost independent on the\nconsidered excess of negative charge of the structures. On the other hand, we\nhave shown that a model based solely on nearest-neighbour interactions,\nalthough instructive, is too simple to predict binding energies accurately.\n", "  We study finite size and temperature XX0 Heisenberg spin chain in weak and\nstrong coupling regimes. By using an elegant connection of the model to\nintegrable combinatorics and probability, we explore and interpret a possible\nphase structure of the model in asymptotic limit: the limit of large inverse\ntemperature and size. First, partition function and free energy of the model\nare derived by using techniques and results from random matrix models and\nnonintersecting Brownian motion. We show that, in the asymptotic limit,\npartition function of the model, written in terms of matrix integral, is\ngoverned by the Tracy-Widom distribution. Second, the exact analytic results\nfor the free energy, which is obtained by the asymptotic analysis of the\nTracy-Widom distribution, indicate a completely new and sophisticated phase\nstructure of the model. This phase structure consists of second- and\nthird-order phase transitions. Finally, to shed light on our new results, we\nprovide a possible interpretation of the phase structure in terms of dynamical\nbehavior of magnons in the spin chain. We demonstrate distinct features of the\nphases with schematic spin configurations which have definite features in each\nregion of the phase diagram.\n", "  Earlier, the DC hole-current modeling of PCMO RRAM by drift-diffusion (DD)\nincluding self-heating (SH) in TCAD (but without ionic transport) was able to\nexplain the experimentally observed SCLC characteristics, prior to resistive\nswitching. Further, transient analysis using DD+SH model was able to reproduce\nthe experimentally observed fast current increase at ~100ns timescale followed\nby saturation increases, prior to resistive switching. However, resistive\nswitching requires the inclusion of ionic transport. We propose a\nReaction-Drift (RD) model of oxide ions, which is combined with the DD+SH\nmodel. Experimentally, SET operations consist of 3 stages and RESET operations\nconsists of 4 stages. The DD+SH+RD model is able to reproduce the entire\ntransient behavior over 10$^{-8}$-1s range in timescale for both SET and RESET\noperations for a range of bias, temperature. Remarkably, a universal RESET\nbehaviour of $log(I)\\propto m*log(t)$, where $m\\approx -1/10$, is reproduced.\nThe quantitatively different voltage time dilemma for SET and RESET is also\nreplicated for a range of ambient temperature. This demonstrates a\ncomprehensive model for resistance switching in PCMO based RRAM.\n", "  We compare contributions from the triangle diagram and the $D\\bar D^*$ bubble\nchain to the processes of $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow J/\\psi\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ and\n$e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow (D\\bar D^*)^\\mp\\pi^{\\pm}$. By fitting the $J/\\psi\\pi$\nmaximum spectrum and the $D\\bar D^*$ spectrum, we find that the triangle\ndiagram cannot explain the new data from BESIII Collaboration at center of mass\nat 4.23GeV and 4.26GeV, simultaneously. On the contrary, the molecular\nassignment of $Z_c(3900)$ gives a much better description.\n", "  Hyperfluid model is reconstructed on the basis of its action free from any\nexternal constraints, regarding the hyperfluid as a self-consistent classical\nfield. Intrinsic hypermomentum is no more a given variable, but arises purely\nfrom the diffeomorphism covariance of the dynamical field, which allows the\nhypermomentum to be exchanged via fundamental interactions of various classes;\nfluid-fluid interactions, SU(n)-gauge coupling with non-minimal interaction,\nand coupling with the metric-affine gravity are all successfully formulated in\nthe classical regime.\n", "  By employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization approach, we study the\nquasi-two-body $B^0_{(s)}\\to \\eta_c{(2S)}\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decays, where the pion\npair comes from the $S$-wave resonance $f_0(X)$. The Breit$-$Wigner formula for\nthe $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(1500)$ resonances, and the Flatt\\'e model for the\n$f_0(980)$ resonance are adopted to parameterize the time-like scalar form\nfactors in the two-pion distribution amplitudes. As a comparison, Bugg's model\nis also used for the wide $f_0(500)$ in this work. For decay rates, we found\nthe following PQCD predictions: (a) $ {\\cal B}(B^0_s\\to \\eta_c(2S)\nf_0(X)[\\pi^+\\pi^-]_s )=\\left ( 2.67^{+1.78}_{-1.08} \\right )\\times 10^{-5}$\nwhen the contributions from $f_0(980)$ and $f_0(1500)$ are all taken into\naccount; (b) ${\\cal B}(B^0\\to \\eta_c(2S) f_0(500)[\\pi^+\\pi^-]_s)= \\left ( 1.40\n^{+0.92}_{-0.56} \\right ) \\times 10^{-6}$ in the Breit-Wigner model and $ \\left\n( 1.53 ^{+0.97}_{-0.61} \\right ) \\times 10^{-6}$ in the Bugg's model.\n", "  The astrophysical $S$-factor of $E$1 transition for\n$^{12}$C($\\alpha$,$\\gamma_0$)$^{16}$O is discussed in the $R$-matrix theory.\nThe reduced $\\alpha$-particle widths of the 1$^-_1$ ($E_x= 7.12$ MeV) and\n1$^-_2$ ($E_x= 9.59$ MeV) states are extracted from the result of the potential\nmodel. The formal parameters are obtained without the linear approximation to\nthe shift function. The resultant $E$1 $S$-factor is not strongly enhanced by\nthe subthreshold 1$^-_1$ state if the channel radius is 4.75 fm. The calculated\n$\\beta$-delayed $\\alpha$-particle spectrum of $^{16}$N and the $p$-wave phase\nshift of $\\alpha$+$^{12}$C elastic scattering are also found to be consistent\nwith the previous studies. The small channel radius leads to the low\npenetrability to the Coulomb barrier, and it makes the reduced $E$1 $S$-factor\nbelow the barrier. Owing to the large reduced width from the molecular\nstructure, the $R$-matrix pole of the 1$^-_2$ state is shifted in the vicinity\nof 1$^-_1$. The proximity of the two poles suppresses the interference between\nthe states. The transparency of the $\\alpha$+$^{12}$C system appears to be\nexpressed as the shrinking strong interaction region.\n", "  Conjugate gradient methods for energy minimization in micromagnetics are\ncompared. When the step length in the line search is controlled, conjugate\ngradient techniques are a fast and reliable way to compute the hysteresis\nproperties of permanent magnets. The method is applied to investigate\ndemagnetizing effects in NdFe12 based permanent magnets. The reduction of the\ncoercive field by demagnetizing effects is 1.4 T at 450 K.\n", "  The Ehrenfest dynamics, representing a quantum-classical mean-field type\ncoupling, is a widely used approximation in quantum molecular dynamics. In this\npaper, we propose a time-splitting method for an Ehrenfest dynamics, in the\nform of a nonlinearly coupled Schr\\\"odinger-Liouville system. We prove that our\nsplitting scheme is stable uniformly with respect to the semiclassical\nparameter, and, moreover, that it preserves a discrete semiclassical limit.\nThus one can accurately compute physical observables using time steps induced\nonly by the classical Liouville equation, i.e., independent of the small\nsemiclassical parameter - in addition to classical mesh sizes for the Liouville\nequation. Numerical examples illustrate the validity of our meshing strategy.\n", "  In this paper we discuss some general properties of viscoelastic models\ndefined in terms of constitutive equations involving infinitely many\nderivatives (of integer and fractional order). In particular, we consider as a\nworking example the recently developed Bessel models of linear viscoelasticiy\nthat, for short times, behave like fractional Maxwell bodies of order $1/2$.\n", "  Current theories of superfluidity are based on the idea of a coherent quantum\nstate with topologically protected, quantized circulation. When this\ntopological protection is absent, as in the case of $^3$He-A, the coherent\nquantum state no longer supports persistent superflow. Here we argue that the\nloss of topological protection in a superconductor gives rise to an insulating\nground state. We specifically introduce the concept of a Skyrme insulator to\ndescribe the coherent dielectric state that results from the topological\nfailure of superflow carried by a complex vector order parameter. We apply this\nidea to the case of SmB$_6$, arguing that the observation of a diamagnetic\nFermi surface within an insulating bulk can be understood in terms of a Skyrme\ninsulator. Our theory enables us to understand the linear specific heat of\nSmB$_6$ in terms of a neutral Majorana Fermi sea and leads us to predict that\nin low fields of order a Gauss, SmB6 will develop a Meissner effect.\n", "  We report on a search for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with the Green Bank\nNorthern Celestial Cap (GBNCC) Pulsar Survey at 350 MHz. Pointings amounting to\na total on-sky time of 61 days were searched to a DM of 3000 pc cm$^{-3}$ while\nthe rest (23 days; 29% of the total time) were searched to a DM of 500 pc\ncm$^{-3}$. No FRBs were detected in the pointings observed through May 2016. We\nestimate a 95% confidence upper limit on the FRB rate of $3.6\\times 10^3$ FRBs\nsky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a peak flux density of 0.63 Jy at 350 MHz for an\nintrinsic pulse width of 5 ms. We place constraints on the spectral index\n$\\alpha$ by running simulations for different astrophysical scenarios and\ncumulative flux density distributions. The non-detection with GBNCC is\nconsistent with the 1.4-GHz rate reported for the Parkes surveys for $\\alpha >\n+0.35 $ in the absence of scattering and free-free absorption and $\\alpha >\n-0.3$ in the presence of scattering, for a Euclidean flux distribution. The\nconstraints imply that FRBs exhibit either a flat spectrum or a spectral\nturnover at frequencies above 400 MHz. These constraints also allow estimation\nof the number of bursts that can be detected with current and upcoming surveys.\nWe predict that CHIME may detect anywhere from several to $\\sim$50 FRBs a day\n(depending on model assumptions), making it well suited for interesting\nconstraints on spectral index, the log $N$-log $S$ slope and pulse profile\nevolution across its bandwidth (400-800 MHz).\n", "  We generalize the hierarchy construction to generic 2+1D topological orders\n(which can be non-Abelian) by condensing Abelian anyons in one topological\norder to construct a new one. We show that such construction is reversible and\nleads to a new equivalence relation between topological orders. We refer to the\ncorresponding equivalent class (the orbit of the hierarchy construction) as\n\"the non-Abelian family\". Each non-Abelian family has one or a few root\ntopological orders with the smallest number of anyon types. All the Abelian\ntopological orders belong to the trivial non-Abelian family whose root is the\ntrivial topological order. We show that Abelian anyons in root topological\norders must be bosons or fermions with trivial mutual statistics between them.\nThe classification of topological orders is then greatly simplified, by\nfocusing on the roots of each family: those roots are given by non-Abelian\nmodular extensions of representation categories of Abelian groups.\n", "  The Born rule provides a probability vector (distribution) with a quantum\nstate for a measurement setting. For two settings, we have a pair of vectors\nfrom the same quantum state. Each pair forms a combined-probability vector that\nobeys certain quantum constraints, which are triangle inequalities in our case.\nSuch a restricted set of combined vectors, titled combined-probability space,\nis presented here for a $d$-level quantum system (qudit). The combined space\nturns out a compact convex subset of a Euclidean space, and all its extreme\npoints come from a family of parametric curves. Considering a suitable concave\nfunction on the combined space to estimate the uncertainty, we deliver an\nuncertainty relation by finding its global minimum at the curves for a qudit.\nIf one chooses an appropriate concave (or convex) function, then there is no\nneed to search for the absolute minimum (maximum) on the whole space, it will\nbe at the parametric curves. So these curves are quite useful for establishing\nan uncertainty (or a certainty) relation for a general pair of settings. In the\npaper, we also demonstrate that many known tight (un)certainty relations for a\nqubit can be obtained with the triangle inequalities.\n", "  In collisions of intense beams, or clouds, coherent dynamics open the way for\nfast transformations of light highly relativistic species into one another.\nPossible applications are suggested for situations, each involving two out of\nthree of: photons, neutrinos, or gravitons.\n", "  We present the results of classical molecular dynamics simulations of\ncollision-induced fusion and fragmentation of C$_{60}$ fullerenes, performed by\nmeans of the MBN Explorer software package. The simulations provide information\non structural differences of the fused compound depending on kinematics of the\ncollision process. The analysis of fragmentation dynamics at different initial\nconditions shows that the size distributions of produced molecular fragments\nare peaked for dimers, which is in agreement with a well-established mechanism\nof C$_{60}$ fragmentation via preferential C$_2$ emission. Atomic trajectories\nof the colliding particles are analyzed and different fragmentation patterns\nare observed and discussed. On the basis of the performed simulations,\ncharacteristic time of C$_2$ emission is estimated as a function of collision\nenergy. The results are compared with experimental time-of-flight distributions\nof molecular fragments and with earlier theoretical studies. Considering the\nwidely explored case study of C$_{60}$--C$_{60}$ collisions, we demonstrate\nbroad capabilities of the MBN Explorer software, which can be utilized for\nstudying collisions of a broad variety of nanoscale and biomolecular systems by\nmeans of classical molecular dynamics.\n", "  Asymmetries in the time-dependent rates of $D^0 \\to K^+K^-$ and $D^0 \\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decays are measured in a $pp$ collision data sample collected with\nthe LHCb detector during LHC Run 1, corresponding to an integrated luminosity\nof $3\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The asymmetries in effective decay widths between\n$D^0$ and $\\overline{D}^0$ decays, sensitive to indirect $CP$ violation, are\nmeasured to be $A_\\Gamma(K^+ K^-) = (-0.30 \\pm 0.32 \\pm 0.10)\\times 10^{-3}$\nand $A_\\Gamma(\\pi^+\\pi^-) = (0.46 \\pm 0.58 \\pm 0.12)\\times 10^{-3}$, where the\nfirst uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. These measurements\nshow no evidence for $C\\!P$ violation and improve on the precision of the\nprevious best measurements by nearly a factor of two.\n", "  We study a quantum spin chain invariant by the superalgebra $osp(1|2)$. We\nderived non-linear integral equations for the row-to-row transfer matrix\neigenvalue in order to analyze its finite size scaling behaviour and we\ndetermined its central charge. We have also studied the thermodynamical\nproperties of the obtained spin chain via the non-linear integral equations for\nthe quantum transfer matrix eigenvalue. We numerically solved these NLIE and\nevaluated the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility. The analytical low\ntemperature analysis was performed providing a different value for the\neffective central charge. The computed values are in agreement with the\nnumerical predictions in the literature.\n", "  We show that anisotropic biaxial stress can be used to tune the built-in\ndipole moment of excitons confined in In(Ga)As quantum dots up to complete\nerasure of its magnitude and inversion of its sign. We demonstrate that this\nphenomenon is due to piezoelectricity. We present a model to calculate the\napplied stress, taking advantage of the so-called piezotronic effect, which\nproduces significant changes in the current-voltage characteristics of the\nstrained diode-membranes containing the quantum dots. Finally, self-consistent\nk.p calculations reveal that the experimental findings can be only accounted\nfor by the nonlinear piezoelectric effect, whose importance in quantum dot\nphysics has been theoretically recognized although it has proven difficult to\nsingle out experimentally.\n", "  We have studied the $\\gamma p \\to p \\pi^0 \\eta$ reaction paying attention to\nthe two main mechanisms at low energies, the $\\gamma p \\to \\Delta(1700) \\to\n\\eta \\Delta(1232)$ and the $\\gamma p \\to \\Delta(1700) \\to \\pi N(1535)$. Both of\nthem are driven by the photoexcitation of the $\\Delta(1700)$ and the second one\ninvolves a mechanism that leads to a triangle singularity. We are able to\nevaluate quantitatively the cross section for this process and show that it\nagrees with the experimental determination. Yet, there are some differences\nwith the standard partial wave analysis which does not include explicitly the\ntriangle singularity. The exercise also shows the convenience to explore\npossible triangle singularities in other reactions and how a standard partial\nanalysis can be extended to accommodate them.\n", "  We examine the flavor evolution of neutrinos emitted from the disk-like\nremnant (hereafter called \\lq\\lq neutrino disk\\rq\\rq) of a binary neutron star\n(BNS) merger. We specifically follow the neutrinos emitted from the center of\nthe disk, along the polar axis perpendicular to the equatorial plane. We\ncarried out two-flavor simulations using a variety of different possible\ninitial neutrino luminosities and energy spectra, and for comparison,\nthree-flavor simulations in specific cases. In all simulations, the normal\nneutrino mass hierarchy was used. The flavor evolution was found to be highly\ndependent on the initial neutrino luminosities and energy spectra; in\nparticular, we found two broad classes of results depending on the sign of the\ninitial net electron neutrino lepton number (i.e., the number of neutrinos\nminus the number of antineutrinos). In the antineutrino dominated case, we\nfound that the Matter-Neutrino Resonance (MNR) effect dominates, consistent\nwith previous results, whereas in the neutrino dominated case, a bipolar\nspectral swap develops. The neutrino dominated conditions required for this\nlatter result have been realized, e.g, in a BNS merger simulation that employs\nthe \\lq\\lq DD2\\rq\\rq\\ equation of state for neutron star matter[Phys. Rev. D\n93, 044019 (2016)]. For this case, in addition to the swap at low energies, a\ncollective Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) mechanism generates a high-energy\nelectron neutrino tail. The enhanced population of high-energy electron\nneutrinos in this scenario could have implications for the prospects of\n$r$-process nucleosynthesis in the material ejected outside the plane of the\nneutrino disk.\n", "  A search is performed for third-generation scalar leptoquarks and heavy\nright-handed neutrinos in events containing one electron or muon, one\nhadronically decaying tau lepton, and at least two jets, using a sqrt(s) = 13\nTeV pp collision data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.9\ninverse femtobarns collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. The\nnumber of observed events is found to be in agreement with the standard model\nprediction. A limit is set at 95% confidence level on the product of the\nleptoquark pair production cross section and beta squared where beta is the\nbranching fraction of leptoquark decay to a tau lepton and a bottom quark.\nAssuming beta = 1, third-generation leptoquarks with masses below 850 GeV are\nexcluded at 95% confidence level. An additional search based on the same event\ntopology involves heavy right-handed neutrinos, N[R], and right-handed W\nbosons, W[R] , arising in a left-right symmetric extension of the standard\nmodel. In this search, W[R] bosons are assumed to decay to a tau lepton and\nN[R] followed by the decay of the N[R] to a tau lepton and an off-shell W[R]\nboson. Assuming the mass of the right-handed neutrino to be half of the mass of\nthe right-handed W boson, W[R] boson masses below 2.9 TeV are excluded at 95%\nconfidence level. These results improve on the limits from previous searches\nfor third-generation leptoquarks and heavy right-handed neutrinos with tau\nleptons in the final state.\n", "  The frustrated pyrochlore magnet Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ has the remarkable\nproperty that it orders magnetically, but has no propagating magnons over wide\nregions of the Brillouin zone. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering to\nfollow how the spectrum evolves in cubic-axis magnetic fields. At high fields\nwe observe in addition to dispersive magnons also a two-magnon continuum, which\ngrows in intensity upon reducing the field and overlaps with the one-magnon\nstates at intermediate fields leading to strong renormalization of the\ndispersion relations, and magnon decays. Using heat capacity measurements we\nfind that the low and high field regions are smoothly connected with no sharp\nphase transition, with the spin gap increasing monotonically in field. Through\nfits to an extensive data set we re-evaluate the spin Hamiltonian finding\ndominant quantum exchange terms, which we propose are responsible for the\nanomalously strong fluctuations and quasiparticle breakdown effects observed at\nlow fields.\n", "  Vlasov kinetic theory is extended by adopting an extra one particle\ndistribution function as an additional state variable characterizing the\nmicro-turbulence internal structure. The extended Vlasov equation keeps the\nreversibility, the Hamiltonian structure, and the entropy conservation of the\noriginal Vlasov equation. In the setting of the extended Vlasov theory we then\nargue that the Fokker-Planck type damping in the velocity dependence of the\nextra distribution function induces the Landau damping. The same type of\nextension is made also in the setting of fluid mechanics.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the impact of the excited state quantum phase\ntransition on the adiabatic dynamics for the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Using\na time dependent protocol, we continuously change a model parameter and then\ndiscuss the scaling properties of the system especially close to the excited\nstate quantum phase transition where we find that these depend on the energy\neigenstate. On top, we show that the mean-field dynamics with the time\ndependent protocol gives the correct scaling and expectation values in the\nthermodynamic limit even for the excited states.\n", "  The well-known trigonometric Scarf potential is generalized by adding a\nsinusoidal term and then treated using the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM)\nand the Tridiagonal Representation Approach (TRA). The energy spectrum of the\nassociated bound states are computed. For the AIM, we have improved convergence\nof the quantization condition that terminates the iterations asymptotically.\nThis is accomplished by looking for the range of initial values of the space\nvariable in the terminating condition that produces stable results (plateau of\nconvergence). We have shown that with increasing iteration this plateau of\nconvergence grows up rapidly to an optimal iteration number and then shrinks\nslowly to a point. The value of this point (or points) may depend on the\nphysical parameters. The numerical results have been compared favorably with\nthose resulting from the TRA.\n", "  Starting from the (Hubbard) model of an atom, we demonstrate that the\nuniqueness of the mapping from the interacting to the noninteracting Green's\nfunction, $G\\to G_0$, is strongly violated, by providing numerous explicit\nexamples of different $G_0$ leading to the same physical $G$. We argue that\nthere are indeed infinitely many such $G_0$, with numerous crossings with the\nphysical solution. We show that this rich functional structure is directly\nrelated to the divergence of certain classes of (irreducible vertex) diagrams,\nwith important consequences for traditional many-body physics based on\ndiagrammatic expansions. Physically, we ascribe the onset of these highly\nnon-perturbative manifestations to the progressive suppression of the charge\nsusceptibility induced by the formation of local magnetic moments and/or RVB\nstates in strongly correlated electron systems.\n", "  A non-equilibrium theory of optical conductivity of dirty-limit\nsuperconductors and commensurate charge density wave is presented. We discuss\nthe current response to different experimentally relevant light-field probe\npulses and show that a single frequency definition of the optical conductivity\n$\\sigma(\\omega)\\equiv j(\\omega)/E(\\omega)$ is difficult to interpret out of the\nadiabatic limit. We identify characteristic time domain signatures\ndistinguishing between superconducting, normal metal and charge density wave\nstates. We also suggest a route to directly address the instantaneous\nsuperfluid stiffness of a superconductor by shaping the probe light field.\n", "  In the framework of Einstein-Maxwell-axion theory we consider static\nspherically symmetric solutions, which describe a magnetic monopole in the\naxionic environment. These solutions are interpreted as the solutions for an\naxionic dyon, the electric charge of which is composite, i.e., in addition to\nthe standard central electric charge, it includes an effective electric charge\ninduced by the axion-photon coupling. We focus on the analysis of that\nsolutions, which are characterized by the electric field regular at the center.\nSpecial attention is paid to the solutions with the electric field, which is\nvanishing at the center, has the Coulombian asymptote and thus display an\nextremum at some distant sphere. Constraints on the electric and effective\nscalar charges of such an object are discussed.\n", "  By far cosmology is one of the most exciting subject to study, even more so\nwith the current bulk of observations we have at hand. These observations might\nindicate different kinds of doomsdays, if dark energy follows certain patterns.\nTwo of these doomsdays are the Little Rip (LR) and Little Sibling of the Big\nRip (LSBR). In this work, aside from proving the unavoidability of the LR and\nLSBR in the Eddington-inspired-Born-Infeld (EiBI) scenario, we carry out a\nquantum analysis of the EiBI theory with a matter field, which, from a\nclassical point of view would inevitably lead to a universe that ends with\neither LR or LSBR. Based on a modified Wheeler-DeWitt equation, we demonstrate\nthat such fatal endings seems to be avoidable.\n", "  We discuss a dark family of lepton-like particles with their own \"private\"\ngauge bosons under a local SU'(2)xU'(1) symmetry. The product of dark and\nvisible gauge groups SU'(2)xU'(1)xSU_w(2)xU_Y(1) is broken dynamically to the\ndiagonal (vector-like) subgroup SU(2)xU(1) through the coupling of two scalar\nfields M_i to the Higgs field and the dark lepton-like particles. After\nsubstituting vacuum expectation values for the fields M_i, the Higgs doublet\ncouples in the standard way to the left-handed SU'(2) doublet and right-handed\nsinglets of the dark gauge group, but not to the extra gauge bosons. This\ndefines a new Higgs portal, where the \"dark leptons\" can contribute to the dark\nmatter and interact with Standard Model matter through Higgs exchange. It also\ndefines a dark matter model with internal interactions. At low energies, the\nStandard Model Higgs boson aligns the two electroweak-type symmetry groups in\nthe visible and dark sectors and generates the masses in both sectors. We also\nidentify charge assignments in the dark sector which allow for the formation of\ndark atoms as bound states of dark lepton-like particles. The simplest\nsingle-component dark matter version of the model predicts a dark matter mass\naround 96 GeV, but the corresponding nucleon recoil cross section is ruled out\nby the xenon based experiments. However, multi-component models or models with\na dark SU'(2) doublet mediator instead of the Higgs portal would still be\nviable.\n", "  Nano-thick metallic transition metal dichalcogenides such as VS$_{2}$ are\nessential building blocks for constructing next-generation electronic and\nenergy-storage applications, as well as for exploring unique physical issues\nassociated with the dimensionality effect. However, such 2D layered materials\nhave yet to be achieved through either mechanical exfoliation or bottom-up\nsynthesis. Herein, we report a facile chemical vapor deposition route for\ndirect production of crystalline VS$_{2}$ nanosheets with sub-10 nm thicknesses\nand domain sizes of tens of micrometers. The obtained nanosheets feature\nspontaneous superlattice periodicities and excellent electrical conductivities\n(~3$\\times$10$^{3}$ S cm$^{-1}$), which has enabled a variety of applications\nsuch as contact electrodes for monolayer MoS$_{2}$ with contact resistances of\n~1/4 to that of Ni/Au metals, and as supercapacitor electrodes in aqueous\nelectrolytes showing specific capacitances as high as 8.6$\\times$10$^{2}$ F\ng$^{-1}$. This work provides fresh insights into the delicate\nstructure-property relationship and the broad application prospects of such\nmetallic 2D materials.\n", "  We consider the spontaneous emission of a two-level quantum emitter, such as\nan atom or a quantum dot, in a modulated time-dependent environment with a\nphotonic band gap. An example of such an environment is a dynamical photonic\ncrystal or any other environment with a bandgap whose properties are modulated\nin time, in the effective mass approximation. After introducing our model of\ndynamical photonic crystal, we show that it allows new possibilities to control\nand tailor the physical features of the emitted radiation, specifically its\nfrequency spectrum. In the weak coupling limit and in an adiabatic case, we\nobtain the emitted spectrum and we show the appearance of two lateral peaks due\nto the presence of the modulated environment, separated from the central peak\nby the modulation frequency. We show that the two side peaks are not symmetric\nin height, and that their height ratio can be exploited to investigate the\ndensity of states of the environment. Our results show that a dynamical\nenvironment can give further possibilities to modify the spontaneous emission\nfeatures, such as its spectrum and emission rate, with respect to a static one.\nObservability of the phenomena we obtain is discussed, as well as relevance for\ntailoring and engineering radiative processes.\n", "  Many real-world multilayer systems such as critical infrastructure are\ninterdependent and embedded in space with links of a characteristic length.\nThey are also vulnerable to localized attacks or failures, such as terrorist\nattacks or natural catastrophes, which affect all nodes within a given radius.\nHere we study the effects of localized attacks on spatial multiplex networks of\ntwo layers. We find a metastable region where a localized attack larger than a\ncritical size induces a nucleation transition as a cascade of failures spreads\nthroughout the system, leading to its collapse. We develop a theory to predict\nthe critical attack size and find that it exhibits novel scaling behavior. We\nfurther find that localized attacks in these multiplex systems can induce a\npreviously unobserved combination of random and spatial cascades. Our results\ndemonstrate important vulnerabilities in real-world interdependent networks and\nshow new theoretical features of spatial networks.\n", "  Edge modes in topological insulators are known to be robust against defects.\nWe investigate if this also holds true when the defect is not static, but\nvaries in time. We study the influence of defects with time-dependent coupling\non the robustness of the transport along the edge in a Floquet system of\nhelically curved waveguides. Waveguide arrays are fabricated via direct laser\nwriting in a negative tone photoresist. We find that single dynamic defects do\nnot destroy the chiral edge current, even when the temporal modulation is\nstrong. Quantitative numerical simulation of the intensity in the bulk and edge\nwaveguides confirms our observation.\n", "  We present a unified description of the excitonic properties of four\nmonolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDC's) using an equation of motion\nmethod for deriving the Bethe-Salpeter equation in momentum space. Our method\nis able to cope with both continuous and tight-binding Hamiltonians, and is\nless computational demanding than the traditional first-principles approach. We\nshow that the role of the exchange energy is essential to obtain a good\ndescription of the binding energy of the excitons. The exchange energy at the\n$\\Gamma-$point is also essential to obtain the correct position of the\nC-exciton peak. Using our model we obtain a good agreement between the Rydberg\nseries measured for WS$_2$. We discuss how the absorption and the Rydberg\nseries depend on the doping. Choosing $r_0$ and the doping we obtain a good\nqualitative agreement between the experimental absorption and our calculations\nfor WS$_2$. We also derive a semi-analytical version of Ellitot's formula for\nTMDC's.\n", "  We study the effects of black hole dark matter on the dynamical evolution of\nstars in dwarf galaxies. We find that mass segregation leads to a depletion of\nstars in the center of dwarf galaxies and the appearance of a ring in the\nprojected stellar surface density profile. Using Segue 1 as an example we show\nthat current observations of the projected surface stellar density rule out at\nthe 99.9% confidence level the possibility that more than 6% of the dark matter\nis composed of black holes with a mass of few tens of solar masses.\n", "  We investigate the production cross sections, momentum distributions and\nrapidity distributions for doubly charmed baryons which according to the\nintrinsic heavy quark mechanism are produced nearly at rest. These events\nshould be measurable at fixed-target experiments like STAR@RHIC and AFTER@LHC.\n", "  We revisit nonsingular cosmologies in which the limiting curvature hypothesis\nis realized. We study the cosmological perturbations of the theory and\ndetermine the general criteria for stability. For the simplest model, we find\ngeneric Ostrogradski instabilities unless the action contains the Weyl tensor\nsquared with the appropriate coefficient. When considering two specific\nnonsingular cosmological scenarios(one inflationary and one genesis model), we\nfind ghost and gradient instabilities throughout most of the cosmic evolution.\nFurthermore, we show that the theory is equivalent to a theory of gravity where\nthe action is a general function of the Ricci and Gauss-Bonnet scalars, and\nthis type of theory is known to suffer from instabilities in anisotropic\nbackgrounds. This leads us to construct a new type of curvature invariant\nscalar function. We show that it does not have Ostrogradski instabilities, and\nit avoids ghost and gradient instabilities for most of the interesting\nbackground inflationary and genesis trajectories. We further show that it does\nnot possess additional new degrees of freedom in an anisotropic spacetime. This\nopens the door for studying stable alternative nonsingular very early universe\ncosmologies.\n", "  A self-doping effect between outer and inner CuO$_2$ planes (OPs and IPs) in\nmulti-layer cuprate superconductors is studied. When one considers a\nthree-layer tight-binding model of the Hg-based three-layer cuprate derived\nfrom the first principle calculations, the electron concentration gets to be\nlarge in the OP compared to IP. This is inconsistent with the experimental fact\nthat more hole carriers tend to be introduced into the OP than IP.We\ninvestigate a three-layer Hubbard model with the two-particle self-consistent\napproach for multi-layer systems to incorporate electron correlations. We\nobserve that the double occupancy (antiferromagnetic instability) in the IP\ndecreases (increases) more than the OP, and also reveal that more electrons\ntend to be introduced into the IP than OP to obtain the energy gain from the\non-site Hubbard interaction. These results are consistent with the experimental\nfacts, and this electron distribution between the OP and IP can be interpreted\nas a self-doping effect arising from strong electron correlations.\n", "  We study the effect of critical pairing fluctuations on the electronic\nproperties in the normal state of a clean superconductor in three dimensions.\nUsing a functional renormalization group approach to take the non-Gaussian\nnature of critical fluctuations into account, we show microscopically that in\nthe BCS regime, where the inverse coherence length is much smaller than the\nFermi wavevector, critical pairing fluctuations give rise to a non-analytic\ncontribution to the quasi-particle damping of order $ T_c \\sqrt{Gi} \\ln ( 80 /\nGi )$, where the Ginzburg-Levanyuk number $Gi$ is a dimensionless measure for\nthe width of the critical region. As a consequence, there is a temperature\nwindow above $T_c$ where the quasiparticle damping due to critical pairing\nfluctuations can be larger than the usual $T^2$-Fermi liquid damping due to\nnon-critical scattering processes. On the other hand, in the strong coupling\nregime where $Gi$ is of order unity, we find that the quasiparticle damping due\nto critical pairing fluctuations is proportional to the temperature. Moreover,\nwe show that in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$ the electronic\ndensity of states exhibits a fluctuation-induced pseudogap. We also use\nfunctional renormalization group methods to derive and classify various types\nof processes induced by the pairing interaction in Fermi systems close to the\nsuperconducting instability.\n", "  We report the first experimental measurement of the near-threshold\nphoto-ionization spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon clusters made of\npyrene C16H10 and coronene C24H12, obtained using imaging photoelectron\nphotoion coincidence spectrometry with a VUV synchrotron beamline. The\nexperimental results of the ionization energy are confronted to calculated ones\nobtained from simulations using dedicated electronic structure treatment for\nlarge ionized molecular clusters. Experiment and theory consistently find a\ndecrease of the ionization energy with cluster size. The inclusion of\ntemperature effects in the simulations leads to a lowering of this energy and\nto a quantitative agreement with the experiment. In the case of pyrene, both\ntheory and experiment show a discontinuity in the IE trend for the hexamer.\n", "  The present work is the second part of a series of computations for the\nself-mass-squared of the conformally coupled (CC) scalar interacting with\ngravitons. This work includes the kinetic-kinetic and kinetic-conformal parts,\nand thus completes the full scalar self-mass squared at one loop order in de\nSitter background when combined with the conformal-conformal part previously\nevaluated. We use dimensional regularization and renormalize the results by\nsubtracting appropriate counterterms. The self-mass squared is finally ready to\nquantum-correct the CC scalar field equation so that one can study the effect\nof inflationary produced gravitons on the CC scalar and its observational\nconsequences.\n", "  We address the problem of identifying families of discrete models naturally\nflowing in continuum limit to relativistic quantum field theories. We call them\nDirac graphs. In this work, we require the graphs to obey spectrality property,\nwhich implies that the adjacency matrix can be represented by a continuous\nfunction defined on the spectral space. We also consider deformations of such\ngraphs away from the spectrality. We show that deformations with regular\ncontinuum limit result in background gauge field and gravity. Interestingly,\ngauge interactions appear due to contribution microscopic deformations while\nthe standard gravity can only be a result of macroscopic (adiabatic)\ndeformations.\n", "  Barium monohydride (BaH) is an attractive candidate for extending laser\ncooling and trapping techniques to diatomic hydrides. The apparatus and\nhigh-resolution optical spectroscopy presented here demonstrate progress toward\nthis goal. A cryogenic buffer-gas-cooled molecular beam of BaH was constructed\nand characterized. Pulsed laser ablation into cryogenic helium buffer gas\ndelivers $\\sim1\\times10^{10}$ molecules/sr/pulse in the X$^2\\Sigma^+$\n($v''=0,N''=1$) state of primary interest. More than $1\\times10^7$ of these\nmolecules per pulse enter the downstream science region with forward velocities\nbelow 100 m/s and transverse temperature of 0.1 K. This molecular beam enabled\nhigh-resolution optical spectra of BaH in quantum states relevant to laser\nslowing and cooling. The reported measurements include hyperfine structure and\nmagnetic $g$ factors in the X$^2\\Sigma^+$, B$^2\\Sigma^+$, and A$^2\\Pi_{1/2}$\nstates.\n", "  The problem of determining those multiplets of forces, or sets of force\nmultiplets, acting at a set of points, such that there exists a truss\nstructure, or wire web, that can support these force multiplets with all the\nelements of the truss or wire web being under tension, is considered. The\ntwo-dimensional problem where the points are at the vertices of a convex\npolygon is essentially solved: each multiplet of forces must be such that the\nnet anticlockwise torque around any vertex of the forces summed over any number\nof consecutive points clockwise past the vertex must be non-negative; and one\ncan find a truss structure that supports under tension, and only supports,\nthose force multiplets in a convex polyhedron of force multiplets that is\ngenerated by a finite number of force multiplets each satisfying the torque\ncondition. Progress is also made on the problem where only a subset of the\npoints are at the vertices of a convex polygon, and the other points are\ninside. In particular, in the case where only one point is inside, an explicit\nprocedure is described for constructing a suitable truss, if one exists. An\nalternative recipe to that provided by Guevara-Vasquez, Milton, and Onofrei\n(2011), based on earlier work of Camar Eddine and Seppecher (2003), is given\nfor constructing a truss structure, with elements under either compression or\ntension, that supports an arbitrary collection of balanced forces at the\nvertices of a convex polygon. Finally some constraints are given on the forces\nthat a three-dimension truss, or wire web, under tension must satisfy.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of method of the\nwave-front expansion, also known in the literature as the Buchen-Mainardi\nalgorithm. In particular, many applications of this technique to the\nfundamental models of both ordinary and fractional linear viscoelasticity are\nthoroughly presented and discussed.\n", "  The penetration of a fast projectile into a resistant medium is a complex\nprocess that is suitable for simple modeling, in which basic physical\nprinciples can be profitably employed. This study connects two different\ndomains: the fast motion of macroscopic bodies in resistant media and the\ninteraction of charged subatomic particles with matter at high energies, which\nfurnish the two limit cases of the problem of penetrating projectiles of\ndifferent sizes. These limit cases actually have overlapping applications; for\nexample, in space physics and technology. The intermediate or mesoscopic domain\nfinds application in atom cluster implantation technology. Here it is shown\nthat the penetration of fast nano-projectiles is ruled by a slightly modified\nNewton's inertial quadratic force, namely, $F \\sim v^{2-\\beta}$, where $\\beta$\nvanishes as the inverse of projectile diameter. Factors essential to\npenetration depth are ratio of projectile to medium density and projectile\nshape.\n", "  A proton beamline consisting of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source,\ntwo solenoid magnets, two steerer magnets and a radio frequency quadrupole\n(RFQ) is developed at the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority's (TAEA) Saraykoy\nNuclear Research and Training Center (SNRTC-SANAEM) in Ankara. In Q4 of 2016,\nthe RFQ was installed in the beamline. The high power tests of the RF power\nsupply and the RF transmission line were done successfully. The high power RF\nconditioning of the RFQ was performed recently. The 13.56 MHz ICP source was\ntested in two different conditions, CW and pulsed. The characterization of the\nproton beam was done with ACCTs, Faraday cups and a pepper-pot emittance meter.\nBeam transverse emittance was measured in between the two solenoids of the\nLEBT. The measured beam is then reconstructed at the entrance of the RFQ by\nusing computer simulations to determine the optimum solenoid currents for\nacceptance matching of the beam. This paper will introduce the pulsed beam test\nresults at the SANAEM RFQ beamline. In addition, the high power RF conditioning\nof the RFQ will be discussed.\n", "  The explosion in attosecond technology has opened the gate to investigating\nmany unexplored areas which require ultrahigh spatial and temporal resolution.\nIn the area of nuclear physics, using gamma-rays with ultrahigh resolution in\ntime and space will help to investigate intra-nuclear dynamics in an\nunprecedentedly explicit way. However, the generation of ultrahigh brilliance\nattosecond gamma-ray pulses with current-generation laser facilities has not\nbeen reported. In this letter, we propose a novel method to generate high\ncharge (~1nC) attosecond (<200 attosecond) electron bunch by the near-threshold\nself-injection in a wakefield accelerator. We demonstrate the ability to\ngenerate an ultrahigh-brilliance (> 2*1024 photons s-1mm-2mrad-2 per 0.1%BW)\nattosecond (<200 attosecond) gamma-ray (Emax > 3 MeV) pulse via nonlinear\nCompton scattering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method\nreported to generate attosecond gamma-ray photon source using\ncurrent-generation laser. This is the shortest gamma-ray photon and the highest\nbrilliance photon source in MeV range (orders higher than the results\nreported). This method can be widely applied for experimental generation of 100\nkeV to several MeV high brilliance attosecond gamma-ray sources with current\n~100 TW laser facilities, which will benefit basic science such as application\nin ultra-high resolution radiography.\n", "  The two-dimensional electron gas at the surface of titanates gathered\nattention due to its potential to replace conventional silicon based\nsemiconductors in the future. In this study, we investigated films of the\nparent perovskite CaTiO$_3$, grown by pulsed laser deposition, by means of\nangular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. The films show a c(4x2) surface\nreconstruction after the growth that is reduced to a p(2x2) reconstruction\nunder UV-light. At the CaTiO$_3$ film surface, a two-dimensional electron gas\n(2DEG) is found with an occupied band width of 400 meV. With our findings\nCaTiO$_3$ is added to the group of oxides with a 2DEG at their surface. Our\nstudy widens the phase space to investigate strontium and barium doped\nCaTiO$_3$ and the interplay of ferroelectric properties with the 2DEG at oxide\nsurfaces. This could open up new paths to tailor two-dimensional transport\nproperties of these systems towards possible applications.\n", "  We present a programmable time alignment scheme used in an ASIC for the ATLAS\nforward muon trigger development. The scheme utilizes regenerated clocks with\nprogrammable phases to compensate for the timing offsets introduced by\ndifferent detector trace lengths. Each ASIC used in the design has 104 input\nchannels with delay compensation circuitry providing steps of ~ 3 ns and a full\nrange of 25 ns for each channel. Detailed implementation of the scheme\nincluding majority logic to suppress single-event effects is presented. The\nscheme is flexible and fully synthesizable. The approach is adaptable to other\napplications with similar phase shifting requirements. In addition, the design\nis resource efficient and is suitable for cost-effective digital implementation\nwith a large number of channels.\n", "  We present measurements of the weak gravitational lensing shear power\nspectrum based on $450$ sq. deg. of imaging data from the Kilo Degree Survey.\nWe employ a quadratic estimator in two and three redshift bins and extract band\npowers of redshift auto-correlation and cross-correlation spectra in the\nmultipole range $76 \\leq \\ell \\leq 1310$. The cosmological interpretation of\nthe measured shear power spectra is performed in a Bayesian framework assuming\na $\\Lambda$CDM model with spatially flat geometry, while accounting for small\nresidual uncertainties in the shear calibration and redshift distributions as\nwell as marginalising over intrinsic alignments, baryon feedback and an\nexcess-noise power model. Moreover, massive neutrinos are included in the\nmodelling. The cosmological main result is expressed in terms of the parameter\ncombination $S_8 \\equiv \\sigma_8 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3}$ yielding $S_8 = \\\n0.651 \\pm 0.058$ (3 z-bins), confirming the recently reported tension in this\nparameter with constraints from Planck at $3.2\\sigma$ (3 z-bins). We\ncross-check the results of the 3 z-bin analysis with the weaker constraints\nfrom the 2 z-bin analysis and find them to be consistent. The high-level data\nproducts of this analysis, such as the band power measurements, covariance\nmatrices, redshift distributions, and likelihood evaluation chains are\navailable at http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/\n", "  We report on spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) measurements of Pt Hall bars\non the antiferromagnetic NiO(111) single crystal. An SMR with a sign opposite\nof conventional SMR is observed over a wide range of temperatures as well as\nmagnetic fields stronger than 0.25T. The negative sign of the SMR can be\nexplained by the alignment of magnetic moments being almost perpendicular to\nthe external magnetic field within the easy plane (111) of the antiferromagnet.\nThis correlation of magnetic moment alignment and external magnetic field\ndirection is realized just by the easy-plane nature of the material without the\nneed of any exchange coupling to an additional ferromagnet. The SMR signal\nstrength decreases with increasing temperature, primarily due to the decrease\nin N\\'eel order by including fluctuations. An increasing magnetic field\nincreases the SMR signal strength as there are less domains and the magnetic\nmoments are more strongly manipulated at high magnetic fields. The SMR is\nsaturated at an applied magnetic field of $6$~T resulting in a spin-mixing\nconductance of $\\sim10^{18}~ \\Omega^{-1}$m$^{-2}$, which is comparable to that\nof Pt on insulating ferrimagnets such as yttrium iron garnet. An argon plasma\ntreatment doubles the spin-mixing conductance.\n", "  We study the phenomenological implications of the presence of two texture\nzeros in the neutrino mass matrix assuming that the neutrino mixing matrix has\nits first column identical to that of the tribimaximal mixing matrix. Only two\npatterns of this kind are compatible with the experimental data. These textures\nhave definite predictions for the neutrino observables that are testable in\nfuture neutrino experiments.\n", "  We report here several technical improvements to the HAYSTAC (Haloscope at\nYale Sensitive To Axion Cold dark matter) that have improved operational\nefficiency, sensitivity, and stability.\n", "  It is a well-known fact that the presence of a massive perturber interacting\nwith a population of minor bodies following very eccentric orbits can strongly\naffect the distribution of their nodal distances. The details of this process\nhave been explored numerically and its outcome confirmed observationally in the\ncase of Jupiter, where a bimodal distribution of nodal distances of comets has\nbeen found. Here, we show evidence for a possible bimodal distribution of the\nnodal distances of the extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) in the form of a\npreviously unnoticed correlation between nodal distance and orbital\ninclination. This proposed correlation is unlikely to be the result of\nobservational bias as data for both large semimajor axis Centaurs and comets\nfit well into the pattern found for the ETNOs, and all these populations are\nsubjected to similar background perturbations when moving well away from the\ninfluence of the giant planets. The correlation found is better understood if\nthese objects tend to avoid a putative planet with semimajor axis in the range\n300-400 au.\n", "  We investigate how the properties of spiral arms relate to other fundamental\ngalaxy properties, including bars and disc breaks. We use previously published\nmeasurements of those properties, and our own measurements of arm and bar\ncontrasts for a large sample of galaxies, using $3.6 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$ images\nfrom the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G). Flocculent\ngalaxies are clearly distinguished from other spiral arm classes, especially by\ntheir lower stellar mass and surface density. Multi-armed and grand-design\ngalaxies are similar in most of their fundamental parameters, excluding some\nbar properties and the bulge-to-total ratio. Based on these results, we revisit\nthe sequence of spiral arm classes, and discuss classical bulges as a necessary\ncondition for standing spiral wave modes in grand-design galaxies. We find a\nstrong correlation between bulge-to-total ratio and bar contrast, and a weaker\ncorrelation between arm and bar contrasts. Barred and unbarred galaxies exhibit\nsimilar arm contrasts, but the highest arm contrasts are found exclusively in\nbarred galaxies. Interestingly, the bar contrast, and its increase from\nflocculent to grand-design galaxies, is systematically more significant than\nthat of the arm contrast. We corroborate previous findings concerning a\nconnection between bars and disc breaks. In particular, in grand-design\ngalaxies the bar contrast correlates with the normalised disc break radius.\nThis does not hold for other spiral arm classes or the arm contrast. Our\nmeasurements of arm and bar contrast and radial contrast profiles are publicly\navailable.\n", "  We investigate in details the gravitational wave (GW) from the first-order\nphase transition (PT) in the extended standard model of particle physics with a\ndimension-six operator, which is capable of exhibiting the recently discovered\nslow first-order PT in addition to the usually studied fast first-order PT. To\nsimplify the discussion, it is sufficient to work with an example of a toy\nmodel with the sextic term, and we propose an unified description for both slow\nand fast first-order PTs. We next study the full one-loop effective potential\nof the model with fixed/running renormalization-group (RG) scales. Compared to\nthe prediction of GW energy density spectrum from the fixed RG scale, we find\nthat the presence of running RG scale could amplify the peak amplitude by\namount of one order of magnitude while shift the peak frequency to the lower\nfrequency regime, and the promising regime of detection within the sensitivity\nranges of various space-based GW detectors shrinks down to a lower cut-off\nvalue of the sextic term rather than the previous expectation.\n", "  We analyse spectral properties of a class of compact perturbations of block\nToeplitz operators associated with analytic symbols. In particular, a limiting\nabsorption principle and the absence of singular continuous spectrum are shown.\nThe existence and the completeness of wave operators are also obtained. Our\nstudy is based on the construction of a conjugate operator in Mourre sense for\nthe corresponding Laurent operators.\n", "  We extend the theory of ground states of classical Heisenberg spin systems\npublished previously by a closer investigation of the convex Gram set of $N$\nspins. This is relevant for the present purpose since the set of ground states\nof a given spin system corresponds to a face of Gram set. The investigation of\nthe Gram set is facilitated by the determination of its symmetry group. The\ncase of the general spin triangle is completely solved and illustrated by a\ncouple of examples.\n", "  In this paper, we have considered flat\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric in the framework of perfect\nfluid models and modified $f(G)$ gravity (where $G$ is the Gauss Bonnet\ninvariant). Particularly, we have considered particular realistic $f(G)$\nconfigurations that could be used to cure finite-time future singularities\narising in the late-time cosmic accelerating epochs. We have then developed the\nviability bounds of these models induced by weak and null energy conditions, by\nusing the recent estimated numerical figures of the deceleration, Hubble, snap\nand jerk parameters.\n", "  Because of the vast volume of data being produced by today's scientific\nsimulations, lossy compression allowing user-controlled information loss can\nsignificantly reduce the data size and the I/O burden. However, for large-scale\ncosmology simulation, such as the Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code\n(HACC), where memory overhead constraints restrict compression to only one\nsnapshot at a time, the lossy compression ratio is extremely limited because of\nthe fairly low spatial coherence and high irregularity of the data. In this\nwork, we propose a pattern-matching (similarity searching) technique to\noptimize the prediction accuracy and compression ratio of SZ lossy compressor\non the HACC data sets. We evaluate our proposed method with different\nconfigurations and compare it with state-of-the-art lossy compressors.\nExperiments show that our proposed optimization approach can improve the\nprediction accuracy and reduce the compressed size of quantization codes\ncompared with SZ. We present several lessons useful for future research\ninvolving pattern-matching techniques for lossy compression.\n", "  Tap water, demineralized water and liquid fertilizer have been activated\nusing an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) to investigate their benefits\nfor the germination rate and stem elongation rate of lentils from Puy-en-Velay\n(France). By plasma-activating tap water, we have obtained germination rates as\nhigh as 80% (instead of 30% with tap water). Also, higher stem elongation rates\nand final stem lengths were obtained using activated tap water compared with\ncommercial fertilizer. We show that these rates of germination and stem growth\nstrongly depend on the combination of two radicals generated in the liquids by\nthe plasma: hydrogen peroxide and nitrate. This synergy appears to be a\ncondition for releasing seed dormancy through the endogenous production of NO\nradicals.\n", "  In this review, we give a brief introduction on the aspects of some extra\ndimension models and the five-dimensional thick brane models in extended\ntheories of gravity. First, we briefly introduce the Kaluza-Klein theory, the\ndomain wall model, the large extra dimension model, and the warped extra\ndimension models. Then some thick brane solutions in extended theories of\ngravity are reviewed. Finally, localization of bulk matter fields on thick\nbranes is discussed.\n", "  The dynamics of stably stratified stellar radiative zones is of considerable\ninterest due to the availability of increasingly detailed observations of Solar\nand stellar interiors. This article reports the first non-axisymmetric and\ntime-dependent simulations of flows of anelastic fluids driven by baroclinic\ntorques in stably stratified rotating spherical shells -- a system serving as\nan elemental model of a stellar radiative zone. With increasing baroclinicity a\nsequence of bifurcations from simpler to more complex flows is found in which\nsome of the available symmetries of the problem are broken subsequently. The\npoloidal component of the flow grows relative to the dominant toroidal\ncomponent with increasing baroclinicity. The possibility of magnetic field\ngeneration thus arises and this paper proceeds to provide some indications for\nself-sustained dynamo action in baroclinically-driven flows. We speculate that\nmagnetic fields in stably stratified stellar interiors are thus not necessarily\nof fossil origin as it is often assumed.\n", "  We propose to study the partonic structure of $^4$He by measuring the Beam\nSpin Asymmetry (BSA) in coherent Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) and\nthe differential cross-section of the Deeply Virtual Meson Production (DVMP) of\nthe $\\phi$. Despite its simple structure, a light nucleus such as $^4$He has a\ndensity and a binding energy comparable to that of heavier nuclei. Therefore,\nby studying $^4$He nucleus, one can learn typical features of the partonic\nstructure of atomic nuclei.\n  The combination of CLAS12 and the ALERT detector provides a unique\nopportunity to study both the quark and gluon structure of a dense light\nnucleus. Coherent exclusive DVCS off $^4$He will probe the transverse spatial\ndistribution of quarks in the nucleus as a function of the quarks' longitudinal\nmomentum fraction, $x$. In parallel, the average spatial transverse gluon\ndensity of the $^4$He nucleus will be extracted within a GPD framework using\nthe measured longitudinal cross-section for coherent $\\phi$ production in a\nsimilar range of $x$. Additionally, threshold effects of $\\phi$ production can\nbe explored by exploiting the ALERT detector's large acceptance for low $|t|$\nevents.\n", "  We present a heterogeneous search algorithm for broadband extended\ngravitational-wave emission (BEGE), expected from gamma-ray bursts and\nenergetic core-collapse supernovae. It searches the $(f,\\dot{f})$-plane for\nlong duration bursts by inner engines slowly exhausting their energy reservoir\nby matched filtering on a {\\em Graphics Processor Unit} (GPU) over a template\nbank of millions of one-second duration chirps. Parseval's Theorem is used to\npredict the standard deviation $\\sigma$ of filter output, taking advantage of\nnear-Gaussian noise in LIGO S6 data over 350-2000 Hz. Tails exceeding a\nmulitple of $\\sigma$ are communicated back to a {\\em Central Processing Unit}\n(CPU). This algorithm attains about 65\\% efficiency overall, normalized to the\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT). At about one million correlations per second over\ndata segments of 16 s duration $(N=2^{16}$ samples), better than real-time\nanalysis is achieved on a cluster of about a dozen GPUs. We demonstrate its\napplication to the capture of high frequency hardware LIGO injections. This\nalgorithm serves as a starting point for deep all-sky searches in both archive\ndata and real-time analysis in current observational runs.\n", "  Stellar shells are low surface brightness arcs of overdense stellar regions,\nextending to large galactocentric distances. In a companion study, we\nidentified 39 shell galaxies in a sample of 220 massive ellipticals\n($\\mathrm{M}_{\\mathrm{200crit}}>6\\times10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) from the\nIllustris cosmological simulation. We used stellar history catalogs to trace\nthe history of each individual star particle inside the shell substructures,\nand we found that shells in high-mass galaxies form through mergers with\nmassive satellites (stellar mass ratios $\\mu_{\\mathrm{stars}}\\gtrsim1:10$).\nUsing the same sample of shell galaxies, the current study extends the stellar\nhistory catalogs in order to investigate the metallicity of stellar shells\naround massive galaxies. Our results indicate that outer shells are often times\nmore metal-rich than the surrounding stellar material in a galaxy's halo. For a\ngalaxy with two different satellites forming $z=0$ shells, we find a\nsignificant difference in the metallicity of the shells produced by each\nprogenitor. We also find that shell galaxies have higher mass-weighted\nlogarithmic metallicities ([Z/H]) at $2$-$4\\,\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$\ncompared to galaxies without shells. Our results indicate that observations\ncomparing the metallicities of stars in tidal features, such as shells, to the\naverage metallicities in the stellar halo can provide information about the\nassembly histories of galaxies.\n", "  The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will enable revolutionary studies\nof galaxies, dark matter, and black holes over cosmic time. The LSST Galaxies\nScience Collaboration has identified a host of preparatory research tasks\nrequired to leverage fully the LSST dataset for extragalactic science beyond\nthe study of dark energy. This Galaxies Science Roadmap provides a brief\nintroduction to critical extragalactic science to be conducted ahead of LSST\noperations, and a detailed list of preparatory science tasks including the\nmotivation, activities, and deliverables associated with each. The Galaxies\nScience Roadmap will serve as a guiding document for researchers interested in\nconducting extragalactic science in anticipation of the forthcoming LSST era.\n", "  The study of SIS epidemics on networks has stressed the role of the network\ntopology on the spreading process. However, accurate models of SIS epidemics\nrely on the complete knowledge of the network topology, which is often not\navailable. This paper tackles the problem of inferring the network topology\nfrom observed infection time traces, especially where the network topology is\npartially known or known with some uncertainty. We propose a Bayesian method to\ninfer the posterior probability of uncertain links in the network, and we\nderive closed form equations for these probabilities. We also propose a\nnumerical approach based on a Gibbs sampling when the number of uncertain links\nis large such that using the closed form equations becomes impractical.\nNumerical results show the capability of the proposed approach to assign high\nprobability to existing links and low probability to non-existing links of the\nnetwork when the SIS traces are sufficiently long.\n", "  Here we developed a new conceptual, stochastic Heterogeneous Opinion-Status\nmodel (HOpS model), which is adaptive network model. The HOpS model admits to\nidentify the main attributes of dynamics on networks and to study analytically\nthe relation between topological network properties and processes taking place\non a network. Another key point of the HOpS model is the possibility to study\nnetwork dynamics via the novel parameter of heterogeneity. We show that not\nonly clear topological network properties, such as node degree, but also, the\nnodes' status distribution (the factor of network heterogeneity) play an\nimportant role in so-called opinion spreading and information diffusion on a\nnetwork. This model can be potentially used for studying the co-evolution of\nglobally aggregated or averaged key observables of the earth system. These\ninclude natural variables such as atmospheric, oceanic and land carbon stocks,\nas well as socio-economic quantities such as global human population, economic\nproduction or wellbeing.\n", "  Recent measurements of the proton radius using the Lamb shift in muonic\nhydrogen are troublingly discrepant with values extracted from hydrogen\nspectroscopy and electron-proton scattering experiments. This discrepancy,\nwhich differs by more than five standard deviations, may be a signal of new\nphysics caused by a violation of lepton universality. Another candidate for a\nnew physics signal is the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The measurement at\nBNL differs from the standard model prediction by at least three standard\ndeviations. Motivated by these two puzzles, first we use polarized\nlepton-nucleon elastic scattering to search for a new scalar boson, and\nfurthermore we suggest new measurements of the nucleon form factors. Next, we\ndisplay a method to analyze the beam dump experiments without using\napproximation on phase space, and we use it to constrain all possible new\nspin-0 and spin-1 particles, and a variety of other measurements to study the\npossibility of the new physics. Finally, assuming a new scalar boson can solve\nthe two puzzles simultaneously, we present a general model-independent analysis\nand constrain the existence of the new physics.\n", "  The ubiquity of parametric resonance is continually evident in the repeated\nexperimental observations of this phenomenon in multiple physical systems. The\nelementary case of 2 mode parametric resonance of order 1 involves the\nexcitation of a spectral tone of a parametrically driven mode at a sub-harmonic\nfrequency of the higher directly driven mode. Historically, such examples of\nparametric resonance have been predominantly researched in a system of micro-\nand nanoelectromechanical resonators. Here, in this paper, we break this\nconvention by showcasing a collection of experimental signatures in support of\nthe concept of \"N-mode parametric resonance\" using a number of elementary\nmicroelectromechanical devices. Specifically, we present observations of 2, 3,\n(2+3) and (3+3) mode parametric resonances demonstrating co-existence of\ndifferent regimes within the same device. In addition, we also present\nobservations of intrinsic \"Four-Wave Mixing\" of parametric excitations. This\npaper presents contributions towards the existence proof for such multimode\nparametric resonances which can also be exploited for engineering benefit\nwithin the field of \"micro and nanoelectromechanical resonators\". The\nexperimental results further point towards the possibility of the ultimate\nobservation of N-mode parametric resonance in such physical system.\n", "  In all-perpendicular spin valve nanopillars the probability density of the\nfree-layer magnetization is independent of the azimuthal angle and its\nevolution equation simplifies considerably compared to the general,\nnonaxisymmetric geometry. Expansion of the time-dependent probability density\nto Legendre polynomials enables analytical integration of the evolution\nequation and yields a compact expression for the practically relevant switching\nprobability. This approach is valid when the free layer behaves as a\nsingle-domain magnetic particle and it can be readily applied to fitting\nexperimental data.\n", "  We have cross-matched the LAMOST DR3 with the Gaia DR1 TGAS catalogs and\nobtained a sample of 166,827 stars with reliable kinematics. A technique based\non the wavelet transform was applied to detect significant overdensities in\nvelocity space among five subsamples divided by spatial position. In total, 16\nsignificant overdensities of stars with very similar kinematics were\nidentified. Among these, four are new stream candidates and the rest are\npreviously known groups. Both the U-V velocity and metallicity distributions of\nthe local sample show a clear gap between the Hercules structure and the\nHyades-Pleiades structure. The U-V positions of these peaks shift with the\nspatial position. Following a description of our analysis, we speculate on\npossible origins of our stream candidates.\n", "  A wide variety of morphologies arise due to the tetragonal anisotropy in\ninterfacial free energy. In this paper, we report on a family of Extended\nCahn-Hilliard (ECH) models for incorporating tetragonal anisotropy in\ninterfacial free energy. We list the non-zero and independent parameters that\nare introduced in our model and list the constraints on them. For appropriate\nchoice of these parameters, our model can produce a many of the morphologies\nseen in tetragonal systems such as di-pyramids, rods, plates and their\ntruncated variants. We analyse these morphologies and show that they indeed are\nequilibrium morphologies consistent with the Wulff construction.\n", "  Hamilton-Jacobi formalism as a powerful method is being utilized to\nreconsider warm inflationary scenario, where the scalar field as the main\ncomponent deriving inflation interacts with other field. Separating the context\nto strong and weak dissipative regimes, the goal is followed for two popular\nfunction of dissipation coefficient. Applying slow-rolling approximations, the\nrequired perturbation parameters are extracted and by comparison to the latest\nPlanck data, the free parameters are restricted. Possibility of producing an\nacceptable inflation is studied where the result shows that for all cases the\nmodel could successfully suggests amplitude of scalar perturbation, scalar\nspectral index , its running, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio.\n", "  This paper presents investigated results of copper-oxide nanowires used as a\nhumidity sensor. Copper-oxide nanowires films were grown over cross-comb type\ngold electrodes on a SiO2 substrate using thermal annealing technique, and its\nhumidity sensitive characteristics were investigated through resistance across\nthe gold electrodes. These copper-oxide nanowires films revealed high\nsensitivity and long-term stability with fast response time. It was found that\nresistance across gold electrodes of the fabricated sensor decreases with\nincrease in humidity almost linearly on a logarithmic scale. It appears that\ncopper-oxide nanowires can be used as low-cost humidity sensor with high output\nreliability and reproduction rate. The observations were carried out at room\ntemperature (RT) and relative humidity (RH) in the range of 6% to 97%.\n", "  A new approach for selection of Silicon-Controlled Rectifier (SCR) for\nswitching high pulsed currents in the septum magnet power supply is described.\nIn this approach, an attempt is made to select the SCR from its I2t rating\ngiven in data sheet. For this, a factor which we have called I2t derating\nfactor is defined as the ratio of I2t rating of SCR to the I2t value of current\npulse to be switched. Thus, the SCR to be used in power supply is selected from\nits I2t derating factor. Three different experiments were performed using SCR\nof different manufacturers, to estimate the value of I2t derating factors. In\nthese experiments, the SCR was subjected to maximum thermal stress till SCR\nstarted showing degradation. The forward blocking voltage and the leakage\ncurrent are the parameters used for characterizing the SCR before and after the\nstress. The results of these experiments are presented and discussed. This\napproach will be of great help when pulse rating of SCR, like, transient\nthermal impedance is not available. Finally, a method is presented which can\ncontribute to design low-cost and high-reliability septum magnet power supply.\n", "  $BaCuSi_2O_6$ is a quasi-two dimensional spin dimer system and a model\nmaterial for studying Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons in high\nmagnetic fields. The new $Ba_{1-x}Sr_xCuSi_2O_6$ mixed system, which can be\ngrown with x < 0.3, and $BaCuSi_2O_6$, both grown by using a crystal growth\nmethod with enhanced oxygen partial pressure, have the same tetragonal\nstructure ($I4_1/acd$) at room temperature. The mixed system shows no\nstructural phase transition, so that the tetragonal structure is stable down to\nlow temperatures. The oxygen partial pressure acts as control parameter for the\ngrowth process. A detailed understanding of the crystal structure depending on\nthe oxygen content will enable the study of the spin dynamics of field-induced\norder states in this model magnetic compound of high current interest with only\none type of dimer layers, which shows the same distance between the Cu atoms,\nin the structure.\n", "  Effects of Glauber gluons in soft collinear factorization, which cause the\nelastic scattering process between collinear particles, are studied in the\nframe of soft-collinear effective theory(SCET). Glauber modes are added into\nthe Lagrangian before integrated out, which is helpful in studying on\ninteractions between Glauber gluons and (ultra)soft gluons explicitly. It is\nproved that effects of interactions after the hard collision cancel out in\nprocesses inclusive enough. In these processes, effects of couplings between\nGlauber gluons and collinear particles cancel out except for that Glauber\ngluons couple to collinear particles at vertexes adjacent to the final cut or\nhard vertex. While neglecting couplings between Glauber gluons and soft\nparticles, it is proved that elastic scattering effects between spectators\ncancel out in processes considered here. Such cancellation is independent of\ndetails of couplings involving Glauber gluons in processes without interactions\nbetween spectators and active particles except for vertexes at which active\nparticles and spectators are created. Possibility of absorbing Glauber gluon\neffects into collinear and soft Wilson lines is also discussed. \\end{abstract}\n", "  We apply a method that combines the tight-binding approximation and the\nLowdin down-folding procedure to evaluate the electronic band structure of the\nnewly discovered pressure-induced superconductor CrAs. By integrating out all\nlow-lying arsenic degrees of freedom, we derive an effective Hamiltonian model\ndescribing the Cr d bands near the Fermi level. We calculate and make\npredictions for the energy spectra, the Fermi surface, the density of states\nand transport and magnetic properties of this compound. Our results are\nconsistent with local-density approximation calculations as well as they show\ngood agreement with available experimental data for resistivity and Cr magnetic\nmoment.\n", "  The hydrodynamics of a liquid-vapour interface in contact with an\nheterogeneous surface is largely impacted by the presence of defects at the\nsmaller scales. Such defects introduce morphological disturbances on the\ncontact line and ultimately determine the force exerted on the wedge of liquid\nin contact with the surface. From the mathematical point of view, defects\nintroduce perturbation modes, whose space-time evolution is governed by the\ninterfacial hydrodynamic equations of the contact line. In this paper we derive\nthe response function of the contact line to such generic perturbations. The\ncontact line response may be used to design simplified 1+1 dimensional models\naccounting for the complexity of interfacial flows coupled to nanoscale\ndefects, yet offering a more tractable mathematical framework to include\nthermal fluctuations and explore thermally activated contact line motion\nthrough a disordered energy landscape.\n", "  Stochastic symmetries and related invariance properties of finite dimensional\nSDEs driven by general c\\`adl\\`ag semimartingales taking values in Lie groups\nare defined and investigated. In order to enlarge the class of possible\nsymmetries of SDEs, the new concepts of gauge and time symmetries for\nsemimartingales on Lie groups are introduced. Markovian and non-Markovian\nexamples of gauge and time symmetric processes are provided. The considered set\nof SDEs includes affine and Marcus type SDEs as well as smooth SDEs driven by\nL\\'evy processes. Non trivial invariance results concerning a class of iterated\nrandom maps are obtained as special cases.\n", "  The present study is concerned with the fabrication and characterization of\nMe2Y substituted hexaferrites, Ba2Me2Fe12-xTxO22 (Me = Co2+, Mg2+, and Cr2+,\nand T = Fe3+, and Ga3+). The samples were prepared by the conventional ball\nmilling technique and sintering at 1200{\\deg} C. The effect of the choices of\nMe and T ions on the structural and magnetic properties of the hexaferrites\nwere investigated. XRD patterns, magnetic parameters, and M\\\"ossbauer spectra\nof the Co2Y were consistent with a single phase Y-type hexaferrite. However,\nthe CoCr-Y sample was found to be dominated by the Y-type hexaferrite, and\nM-type and BaCrO4 minority phases were observed in the XRD pattern of the\nsample. The small increase in saturation magnetization from about 34 emu/g up\nto 37.5 emu/g was therefore attributed to the development of the M-type phase.\nOn the other hand, XRD pattern of the Cr2Y sample indicated the dominance of\nthe M-type phase in this sample. The high coercivity (1445 Oe) of this sample\nis evidence of the transformation of the material from a typically soft\nmagnetic material (Y-type) to a hard magnet (M-type). The Ga-substitution for\nFe in Co2Y did not affect the saturation magnetization significantly, but the\ncoercivity was reduced. However, the sample Ba2CoMgFe11GaO22 exhibited a\nsignificant reduction of the saturation magnetization down to a value 26.6\nemu/g, which could be due to the attenuation of the super-exchange interactions\ninduced by the Mg2+ substitution.\n", "  A new phenomenon, recently studied in theoretical physics, may have\nconsiderable interest for astronomers: the explosive decay of old primordial\nblack holes via quantum tunnelling. Models predict radio and gamma bursts with\na characteristic frequency-distance relation making them identifiable. Their\ndetection would be of major theoretical importance.\n", "  Many questions have to be answered before understanding the relationship\nbetween the emerging magnetic flux through the solar surface and the extreme\ngeoeffective events. Which threshold determines the onset of the eruption? What\nis the upper limit in energy for a flare? Is the size of sunspot the only\ncriteria to get extreme solar events?\n  Based on observations of previous solar cycles, and theory, the main\ningredients for getting X ray class flares and large Interplanetary Corona Mass\nEjections e.g. the built up of the electric current in the corona, are\npresented such as the existence of magnetic free energy, magnetic helicity,\ntwist and stress in active regions. The upper limit of solar flare energy in\nspace research era and the possible chances to get super-flares and extreme\nsolar events can be predicted using MHD simulation of coronal mass ejections\n", "  We present some general remarks on supersymmetric extensions of\nfermion-scalar and three-fermion preonic models with an assumption of\nsupersymmetry is realized at preonic level. The motivation and the requirement\nof this assumption are briefly given. In general, supersymmetric extensions of\nfermion-scalar (three-fermion) models predict 4 (10) \"super\" partners for each\nStandard Model fermion.\n", "  The present thesis deals with some properties of classical and quantum scalar\nfields in an inhomogeneous and/or time-dependent background, focusing on models\nwhere the latter can be described as a curved space-time with an event horizon.\nWhile naturally formulated in a gravitational context, such models extend to\nmany physical systems with an effective Lorentz invariance at low energy. We\nshall see how this effective symmetry allows one to relate the behavior of\nperturbations in these systems to black-hole physics, what are its limitations,\nand in which sense results thus obtained are \"analogous\" to their general\nrelativistic counterparts. The first chapter serves as a general introduction.\nA few notions from Einstein's theory of gravity are introduced and a derivation\nof Hawking radiation is sketched. The correspondence with low-energy systems is\nthen explained through three important examples. The next four chapters each\ndetails one of the works completed during this thesis, updated and slightly\nreorganized to account for new developments which occurred after their\npublication. The other articles I contributed to are summarized in the last\nchapter, before the general conclusion.\n", "  A recent article [W.C.W. Huang and H. Batelaan, arXiv:1708.0057v1] analysed\nthe dualism between optical and difference parametric amplification, performing\na classical analysis of a system where two electromagnetic fields are produced\nby another of a frequency which is the difference of the frequency of the other\ntwo. The authors claimed that this process would not violate energy\nconservation at the classical level, but that a quantum description would\nnecessarily require a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and therefore would not exist.\nIn this work we show that the process can proceed quantum mechanically if\ndescribed by the correct Hamiltonian, that energy conservation is not violated,\nand that fields are produced with interesting quantum statistics. Furthermore,\nwe show that the process can be thought of as different types of already known\nthree-wave mixing processes, with the actual type depending on either initial\nconditions or personal preference.\n", "  We report on diffuse neutron scattering experiments providing evidence for\nthe presence of random strains in the quantum spin ice candidate Pr2Zr2O7.\nSince Pr is a non-Kramers ion, the strain deeply modifies the picture of Ising\nmagnetic moments governing the low temperature properties of this material. It\nis shown that the derived strain distribution accounts for the temperature\ndependence of the specific heat and of the spin excitation spectra. Taking\nadvantage of mean field and spin dynamics simulations, we argue that the\nrandomness in Pr2Zr2O7, promotes a new state of matter, which is disordered,\nyet characterized by short range antiferroquadrupolar correlations, and from\nwhich emerge spin-ice like excitations. This study thus opens an original\nresearch route in the field of quantum spin ice.\n", "  Towards spin selective electronics made of three coordinated carbon atoms,\nhere we computationally propose robust and reversibly bias driven evolution of\npristine undoped graphene nano-ribbons(GNR) into ferromagnetic-semiconductor,\nmetal or a half metal, irrespective of their edge configurations. The evolution\nis a result of a rare ferromagnetic(FM) order emerging among nearest\nneighbouring(n-n) sites, in positively biased regions in their in-homogeneous\nbias unit-cells, in attempt to cooperatively minimise on-site Coulomb repulsion\nand kinetic energy, while maximising localization of electrons at the\npositively biased sites. The phenomenon appears to be a general property of\nin-homogeneously biased Coulomb correlated bipartite systems. Consequences are\nparticularly rich in zigzag edged graphene nano-ribbons(ZGNR) due to the\ncontest of bias driven n-n FM order and the inter-edge antiferromagnetic order\ninherent to ZGNRs, leading to systematic closing of gap for one of the spins,\namounting to bias controlled unmissable opening of window for FM-semiconducting\nand half-metallic transport.\n", "  Sampling from the output distribution of chaotic quantum evolutions, and of\npseudo-random universal quantum circuits in particular, has been proposed as a\nprominent milestone for near-term quantum supremacy. The same paper notes that\nchaotic distributions are very sensitive to noise, and under quite general\nnoise models converge to the uniform distribution over bit-strings\nexponentially in the number of gates. On the one hand, for increasing number of\ngates, it suffices to choose bit-strings at random to approximate the noisy\ndistribution with fixed statistical distance. On the other hand, cross-entropy\nbenchmarking can be used to gauge the fidelity of an experiment, and the\ndistance to the uniform distribution. We estimate that state-of-the-art\nclassical supercomputers would fail to simulate high-fidelity chaotic quantum\ncircuits with approximately fifty qubits and depth forty. A recent interesting\npaper proposed a different approximation algorithm to a noisy distribution,\nextending previous results on the Fourier analysis of commuting quantum\ncircuits. Using the statistical properties of the Porter-Thomas distribution,\nwe show that this new approximation algorithm does not improve random guessing,\nin polynomial time. Therefore, it confirms previous results and does not\nrepresent an additional challenge to the suggested failure stated above.\n", "  This paper integrates the studies of various countries' behaviors, e.g.,\nwaging wars and entering into military alliances, into a general framework of\n\\emph{countries' relation formation}, which consists of two components, i.e., a\nstatic game and a dynamical system. Aside from being a stand-alone framework\nitself, this paper can also be seen as a necessary extension of a recently\ndeveloped \\emph{countries' power allocation game} in \\cite{allocation}. We\nestablish certain theoretical results, such as pure strategy Nash equilibrium\nexistence in the static game, and propose several applications of interest made\npossible by combining both frameworks of countries' power allocation and\nrelation formation.\n", "  Influence maximization serves as the main goal of a variety of social network\nactivities such as viral marketing and campaign advertising. The independent\ncascade model for the influence spread assumes a one-time chance for each\nactivated node to influence its neighbors. This reasonable assumption cannot be\nbypassed, since otherwise the influence probabilities of the nodes, modeled by\nthe edge weights, would be altered. On the other hand, the manually activated\nseed set nodes can be reselected without violating the model parameters or\nassumptions. The reselection of a seed set node, simply means paying extra\nbudget to a previously paid node in order for it to retry its influential\nskills on its uninfluenced neighbors. This view divides the influence\nmaximization process into two cases: the simple case where the reselection of\nthe nodes is not considered and the reselection case. In this study we will\nanalyze the behavior of real world networks on the difference between these two\ninfluence maximization cases. First we will show that the difference between\nthe simple and the reselection cases constitutes a wide spectrum of networks\nranging from the reselection-independent ones, where the reselection case has\nno noticeable advantage to the simple case, to the reselection-friendly ones,\nwhere the influence spread in the reselection case is twice the one in the\nsimple case. Then we will correlate this dynamic to other influence\nmaximization dynamics of the network. Finally, a significant entanglement\nbetween this dynamic and the network structure is shown and verified by the\nexperiments. In other words, a series of conditions on the network structure is\nspecified whose fulfilment is a sign for a reselection-friendly network. As a\nresult of this entanglement, reselection-friendly networks can be spotted\nwithout performing the time consuming influence maximization algorithms.\n", "  The method of simplest equation is applied for obtaining exact solitary\ntraveling-wave solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations that\ncontain monomials of odd and even grade with respect to participating\nderivatives. The used simplest equation is $f_\\xi^2 = n^2(f^2 -f^{(2n+2)/n})$.\nThe developed methodology is illustrated on two examples of classes of\nnonlinear partial differential equations that contain: (i) only monomials of\nodd grade with respect to participating derivatives; (ii) only monomials of\neven grade with respect to participating derivatives. The obtained solitary\nwave solution for the case (i) contains as particular cases the solitary wave\nsolutions of Korteweg-deVries equation and of a version of the modified\nKorteweg-deVries equation.\n", "  I list eight types of astrophysical objects where jets, and more particularly\nthe jet feedback mechanism (JFM), might operate, and discuss cases where an\nobject evolves from one type to another while the JFM continues to operate. In\nfour of these classes of objects jets are known to play significant, or even\ncrucial, roles: in cooling flows, during galaxy formation, in young stellar\nobjects (YSO), and in planetary nebulae. In core collapse supernovae (CCSNe),\nin the common envelope evolution (CEE), in the grazing envelope evolution\n(GEE), and in intermediate-luminosity optical transients (ILOTs) the suggestion\nthat a JFM takes place is still controversial. I call for a refresh thinking\nand more detail studies of the possibility that jets play a large role in\nexploding massive stars and in the CEE. I also present a new speculative\nscenario where the first active galactic nuclei (AGN) were preceded by a JFM\nthat operated during the life time of the supermassive young object (SMYO)\nprogenitor of the AGN. A short and energetic phase of CCSN took place between\nthe SMYO and the AGN phases. I term this scenario of young object to supernova\nto AGN (YOSA) that includes a JFM along all stages, the YOSA-JFM scenario. I\nspeculate that in the YOSA-JFM scenario, the JFM that might have operated\nduring the phase of the SMYO started to establish the correlations between the\nmass of the super-massive black hole (SMBH) and some properties of the stellar\ncomponent of galaxies before the formation of the SMBH.\n", "  We studed alpha decay half-lives of Pb isotopes in the range 178 < A > 220,\nwhithin Gamow-like model (GLM) which is based on Gamow theory. The empirical\nformulae like Royer formula, Universal Decay Low (UDL), Viola-Seaborg formula\n(VSS), Semi-empirical formula for Poenaru (SemFIS) and Denisov-Khudenko formula\n(DEKH) are used to calculate alpha decay half-lives. The results are compared\nwith experimental data, and also with other theoretical models, the results are\nin a good agreement was achieved with experimental data.\n", "  With modern computers we can compute nuclear many-body wave functions with an\nastounding number of component, $ > 10^{10}$. But, aside from reproducing\nand/or predicting experiments, what do we learn from vectors with tens of\nbillions of components? One way to characterize wavefunctions is through\nirreducible representations of groups. I discuss briefly the history of\ngroup-theoretical characterization of nuclear wavefunctions, with an emphasis\nof using Lanczos-type methods to efficiently dissect arbitrary wavefunctions\ninto group irreps. Although the resulting decompositions are often fragmented\nover many irreps, one nonetheless finds powerful patterns. First, group\ndecompositions along rotational bands show coherent commonalities, supporting\nthe picture of a shared \"intrinsic shape;\" this is also called\n\\textit{quasi-dynamical symmetry}. Second, group decompositions for wave\nfunctions using both phenomenological and \\textit{ab initio} forces are often\nvery similar, despite vastly different origins and dimensionalities. Both of\nthese results suggest a group theoretical decomposition can provide a robust\n\"anatomy\" of many nuclear wave functions. This in turn supports the idea of\nusing symmetry-based many-body frameworks for calculations.\n", "  Model rockets have been employed in student projects, but very few papers in\naerospace education offer concise summaries of activities at university-course\nlevels. This paper aims to address this gap in the literature. The rockets used\nby our students reached some 500 m (~1,640 feet) in altitude, deployed a\nparachute, and spent 2-3 minutes descending to the ground. We present a series\nof analyses and experiments that students performed in order to predict the\nflight time, the maximum altitude, and the landing location of these rockets.\nThey wrote computer programs to numerically integrate equations of motion, and\nexperimentally measured input parameters (e.g., the thrust profile and drag\ncoefficients). Once launched, these rockets could not be controlled; targeting\nthe landing location would thus mean tilting the launch rail to a required\nangle. The largest source of error in landing location came from the difficulty\nin modeling wind velocities. Also discussed in this paper are the infrared\nspectroscopy and the extraction experiment as novel additions to model rocket\nprojects.\n", "  Tunable optical devices, in particular, varifocal lenses, have important\napplications in various fields, including imaging and adaptive vision. Recent\nadvances in metasurfaces, which control the wavefront of light using\nsubwavelength-spaced nanostructures, open up new opportunities to replace bulk\noptical devices, with thin, flat, lightweight devices. We have demonstrated for\nthe first time an electrically tunable flat lens, based on large area\nmetasurfaces combined with a dielectric elastomer actuator having inline\ntransparent electrodes, that is capable of simultaneously performing focal\nlength tuning (>100%) as well as dynamic corrections, including astigmatism and\nimage shift. This offers control versatility to flat optics hitherto only\npossible in electron microscopes. The water-based transfer process, which we\ndescribe, also enables wide compatibility across materials. The combination of\nmetasurface optics and dielectric elastomer actuators enables a new, versatile\nplatform for creating all kinds of tunable optical devices, through the design\nof tunable phase, amplitude, and polarization profiles.\n", "  We present new theoretical tools, based on fluctuational electrodynamics and\nthe integral-equation approach to computational electromagnetism, for numerical\nmodeling of forces and torques on bodies of complex shapes and materials due to\nemission of thermal radiation out of thermal equilibrium. This extends our\nrecently-developed fluctuating-surface-current (FSC) and\nfluctuating-volume-current (FVC) techniques for radiative heat transfer to the\ncomputation of non-equilibrium fluctuation-induced forces and torques; as we\nshow, the extension is non-trivial due to the greater computational cost of\nmodeling radiative momentum transfer, including new singularities that must be\ncarefully neutralized. We introduce a new analytical cancellation technique\nthat addresses these challenges and allows, for the first time, accurate and\nefficient prediction of non-equilibrium forces and torques on bodies of\nessentially arbitrary shapes---including asymmetric and chiral particles---and\ncomplex material properties, including continuously-varying and anisotropic\ndielectrics. We validate our approach by showing that it reproduces known\nresults, then present new numerical predictions of non-equilibrium\nself-propulsion, self-rotation, and momentum-transfer phenomena in complex\ngeometries that would be difficult or impossible to study with existing\nmethods. Our findings indicate that the fluctuation-induced dynamics of\nmicron-size room-temperature bodies in cold environments involve microscopic\nlength scales but macroscopic time scales, with typical linear and angular\nvelocities on the order of microns/second and radians/second; For a\nmicron-scale gear driven by thermal radiation from a nearby chiral emitter, we\nfind a strong and non-monotonic dependence of the magnitude and even the\n\\textit{sign} of the induced torque on the temperature of the emitter.\n", "  In this thesis the method for social group evolution discovery, called GED,\nis analyzed. Especially, GED method is compared with other methods tracking\nchanges in groups over time with focus on accuracy, computational cost, ease of\nimplementation and flexibility of the methods. The methods are evaluated on\noverlapping and disjoint social groups. Finally, GED method is run with\ndifferent user importance measures.\n", "  We propose a spin-sensitive scanning probe microscopy experiment on double\nquantum dots in Pauli blockade conditions. Electric spin resonance is induced\nby an AC voltage applied to the scanning gate which induces lifting of the\nPauli blockade of the current. The stationary Hamiltonian eigenstates are used\nas a basis for description of the spin dynamics with the AC potential of the\nprobe. For the two-electron system we evaluate the transitions rates from\ntriplet $\\mathrm{T}_+$ state to singlet $\\mathrm{S}$ or triplet $\\mathrm{T}_0$\nstates, i.e. to conditions in which the Pauli blockade of the current is\nlifted. The rates of the spin-flip transitions are consistent with the\ntransition matrix elements and strongly dependent on the tip position. Probing\nthe spin densities and identification of the final transition state are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We investigate the composable security of unidimensional contin- uous\nvariable quantum key distribution (UCVQKD), which is based on the Gaussian\nmodulation of a single quadrature of the coherent-state of light, aiming to\nprovide a simple implementation of key distribution compared to the\nsymmetrically modulated Gaussian coherent-state protocols. This protocol\nneglects the necessity in one of the quadrature modulation in coherent-states\nand hence reduces the system complexity. To clarify the influence of\nfinite-size effect and the cost of performance degeneration, we establish the\nrelation- ship of the balanced parameters of the unmodulated quadrature and\nestimate the precise secure region. Subsequently, we illustrate the composable\nsecurity of the UCVQKD protocol against collective attacks and achieve the\ntightest bound of the UCVQKD protocol. Numerical simulations show the\nasymptotic secret key rate of the UCVQKD protocol, together with the\nsymmetrically modulated Gaussian coherent-state protocols.\n", "  In about four years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nwill launch a small explorer mission named the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry\nExplorer (IXPE). IXPE is a satellite dedicated to the observation of X-ray\npolarization from bright astronomical sources in the 2-8 keV energy range.\nUsing Gas Pixel Detectors (GPD), the mission will allow for the first time to\nacquire X-ray polarimetric imaging and spectroscopy of about a hundred of\nsources during its first two years of operation. Among them are the most\npowerful sources of light in the Universe: active galactic nuclei (AGN). In\nthis proceedings, we summarize the scientific exploration we aim to achieve in\nthe field of AGN using IXPE, describing the main discoveries that this new\ngeneration of X-ray polarimeters will be able to make. Among these discoveries,\nwe expect to detect indisputable signatures of strong gravity, quantifying the\namount and importance of scattering on distant cold material onto the iron\nK_alpha line observed at 6.4 keV. IXPE will also be able to probe the\nmorphology of parsec-scale AGN regions, the magnetic field strength and\ndirection in quasar jets, and, among the most important results, deliver an\nindependent measurement of the spin of black holes.\n", "  In this contribution, we present WebPlotDigitizer, a polyvalent and free\nsoftware developed to facilitate easy and accurate data extraction from a\nvariety of plot types. We describe the numerous features of this numerical tool\nand present its relevance when applied to astrophysical archival research. We\nexploit WebPlotDigitizer to extract ultraviolet spectropolarimetric spectra\nfrom old publications that used the Hubble Space Telescope, Lick Observatory 3m\nShane telescope and Astro-2 mission to observe the Seyfert-2 AGN NGC 1068. By\ndoing so, we compile all the existing ultraviolet polarimetric data on NGC 1068\nto prepare the ground for further investigations with the future\nhigh-resolution spectropolarimeter POLLUX on-board of the proposed Large\nUV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) NASA mission.\n", "  Results on symplectic spinors and their higher spin versions, concerning\nrepresentation theory and cohomology properties are presented. Exterior forms\nwith values in the symplectic spinors are decomposed into irreducible modules\nincluding finding the hidden symmetry (Schur--Weyl--Howe type duality) given by\na representation of the Lie superalgebra $\\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ in this case. We\nalso determine ranges of the induced exterior symplectic spinor derivatives\nwhen they are restricted to bundles induced by the irreducible submodules\nmentioned. This duality is used to decompose curvature tensors of covariant\nderivatives induced by a Fedosov connection to a symplectic spinor bundle, for\ncharacterizing a subcomplex of the de Rham complex twisted by the spinors and\nfor proving that the complex is of elliptic type. Part of the dual is used to\ncharacterize Fedosov manifolds admitting symplectic Killing spinors and for\nrelating the spectra of the symplectic Rarita--Schwinger and the symplectic\nDirac operator of Habermann. Further, we use the Fomenko--Mishchenko\ngeneralization of the Atiyah--Singer index theorem to prove a kind of Hodge\ntheory is valid for elliptic complexes with differentials on projective and\nfinitely generated bundles over the algebra of compact operators and certain\nfurther ones.\n", "  With coupled Gross-Piteavskii equations we study excitation of\nexciton-polariton vortices and antivortices in a pillar microcavity by a\nGaussian pump beam. The structure of vortices and antivortices shows a strong\ndependence on the microcavity radius, pump geometry, and nonlinear\nexciton-exciton interaction. Due to the nonlinear interaction the strong\nGaussian beam cannot excite more polariton vortices or antivortices with\nrespect to the weak one. The calculation demonstrates that the weak Gaussian\nbeam can excite vortex-antivortex pairs, vortices with high angular momentum,\nand superposition states of vortex and antivortex with high opposite angular\nmomentum. The pump geometry for the Gaussian beam to excite these vortex\nstructures are analyzed in detail, which holds a potential application for\nSagnac interferometry and generating the optical beams with high angular\nmomentum.\n", "  Thirty years ago the optical counterpart of the x-ray source 1H0707-495 was\ndiscovered to be a 15th magnitude broad-line Seyfert galaxy with a rich Fe II\nemission line spectrum typical of the AGN subclass sometimes referred to as the\nI Zw 1 objects after their progenitor. This object became the subject of much\ninterest and investigation just over five years ago when it was shown to have\nundergone dramatic x-ray luminosity variations. This paper presents an\nextensive series of medium resolution spectra recorded at the 1.9 m telescope\nat Sutherland in January 2016. Through co-adding the spectra, we are able to\nachieve a signal-to-noise hitherto not achieved for this object, allowing us to\nresolve individual Fe II lines and measure their relative strengths and\nprofiles to a degree of accuracy not previously available for this AGN. We\nprovide possible physical interpretations of our measurements and investigate\nlinks between the spectral evidence collected in this study and the known x-ray\nbehaviour.\n", "  The vertical upwelling/diffusion model (VUDM) has historically played a key\nrole in shaping our ideas about how the heat balance is achieved in the ocean.\nIts has been and is still widely used in many applications ranging from the\nestimation of transfer coefficients to the parameterisation of ocean heat\nuptake in Simple Climate Models (SCMs). Its conceptual value as a realistic\ntheoretical model of the ocean heat balance has become increasingly unclear\nover the years however, because: 1) the different ways in which upwelling has\nbeen linked to high-latitude deep water formation and downgradient diffusion\nlinked to vertical/diapycnal mixing have remained imprecise and somewhat ad-hoc\nso far; 2) other effects such as isopycnal mixing, density-compensated\ntemperature anomalies, meso-scale eddy-induced advection and the depth-varying\nocean area have all be demonstrated to affect actual ocean heat uptake as well,\nbut their incorporation into existing VUDM frameworks has been problematic. In\nthis paper, a new process-based vertical advection/diffusion theoretical model\nof ocean heat uptake is constructed that resolve all above difficulties. This\nnew model is obtained by coarse-graining the full three-dimensional\nadvection/diffusion for potential temperature carried by ocean climate models,\nby using the same isopycnal analysis as in the theory of ocean water masses.\nThe resulting model describes the temporal evolution of the\nisopycnally-averaged thickness-weighted potential temperature in terms of an\neffective velocity that depends uniquely on the surface heating conditionally\nintegrated in density classes, an effective diapycnal diffusivity controlled by\nisoneutral and dianeutral mixing, and an additional term linked to the\nmeridional transport of density-compensated temperature anomalies by the\ndiabatic residual overturning circulation.\n", "  There is mounting evidence that the IceCube findings cannot be described\nsimply invoking a single power-law spectrum for cosmic neutrinos. We discuss\nwhich are the minimal modifications of the spectrum that are required by the\nexisting observations and we obtain a universal cosmic neutrino spectrum, i.e.\nvalid for all neutrino flavors. Our approach to such task can be outlined in\nthree points: 1) we rely on the throughgoing muon analysis above 200 TeV and on\nthe high-energy starting events (HESE) analysis below this energy, requiring\nthe continuity of the spectrum; 2) we assume that cosmic neutrinos are subject\nto three-flavor neutrino oscillations in vacuum; 3) we make no assumption on\nthe astrophysical mechanism of production, except for no tau neutrino component\nat the source. We test our model using the information provided by HESE\nshower-like events and by the lack of double pulses and resonant events. We\nfind that a two power-law spectrum is compatible with all observations. The\nmodel agrees with the standard picture of pion decay as a source of neutrinos,\nand indicates a slight preference for a pgamma mechanism of production. We\ndiscuss the tension between the HESE and the throughgoing muons datasets around\nfew tens TeV, focussing on the angular distributions of the spectra. The\nexpected number of smoking-gun signatures of nu-tau induced events (referred to\nas double pulses) is quantified: in the baseline model we predict 0.65 double\npulse events in 5.7 years. Uncertainties in the predictions are quantified.\n", "  We present hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a liquid\nsodium flow using the compressible MHD code PLUTO to investigate the magnetic\nfield regeneration in the Von-Karman-Sodium dynamo experiment. The aim of the\nstudy is to analyze the influence of the fluid resistivity and turbulence level\non the collimation by helicoidal motions of a remnant magnetic field. We use a\nsimplified cartesian geometry to represent the flow dynamics in the vicinity of\none cavity of a multi-blades impeller inspired by those used in the\nVon-Karman-Sodium (VKS) experiment. We perform numerical simulations with\nkinetic Reynolds numbers up to 1000 for magnetic Prandtl numbers between 30 and\n0.1. Our study shows that perfect ferromagnetic walls favour enhanced\ncollimation of flow and magnetic fields even if the turbulence degree of the\nmodel increases. The location of the helicoidal coherent vortex in between the\nblades changes with the impinging velocity. It becomes closer to the upstream\nblade and impeller base if the flow incident angle is analogous to the TM73\nimpeller configuration rotating in the unscooping direction. This result is\nalso obtained at higher kinetic Reynolds numbers when the helicoidal vortex\nundergoes a precessing motion, leading to a reinforced effect in the vortex\nevolution and in the magnetic field collimation when using again perfect\nferromagnetic boundary conditions. We estimate the efficiency of a hypothetical\ndynamo loop occurring in the vicinity of the impeller and discuss the relevance\nof our findings in the context of mean field dynamo theory.\n", "  Gaseous detectors are used in both low energy and high energy physics\nexperiments. The present day gaseous detectors, i.e., the Micro-Pattern gaseous\ndetectors (MPGD) are more efficient and fast. Gas Electron multiplier (GEM) is\nquite well know among the MPGD members. The MPGDs are also being used in other\napplications like tomography/imaging, moreover, recently, hybridization of two\ndifferent kinds of MPGD is another emerging subject of R\\&D. Ion feedback is an\nintrinsic drawback of the gaseous detectors. However, it is not a big issue\nwhere the event rate is not very high, or the drift volume is not too large.\nHere, we are showing a simple experimental technique to find the ion feedback\nof a single GEM foil. This can address the experiments/applications where a\nsingle GEM foil is employed.\n", "  The effective properties of composites and review literature on the methods\nof Rayleigh, Natanzon--Filshtinsky, functional equations and asymptotic\napproaches are outlined. In connection with the above methods and new recent\npublications devoted to composites, we discuss the terms \"analytical formula,\napproximate solution, closed form solution, asymptotic formula\" etc...\nfrequently used in applied mathematics and engineering in various contexts.\nThough mathematicians give rigorous definitions of exact form solution the term\n\"exact solution\" continues to be used too loosely and its attributes are lost.\nIn the present paper, we give examples of misleading usage of such a term.\n", "  We analyse a new subdomain scheme for a time-spectral method for solving\ninitial boundary value problems. Whilst spectral methods are commonplace for\nspatially dependent systems, finite difference schemes are typically applied\nfor the temporal domain. The Generalized Weighted Residual Method (GWRM) is a\nfully spectral method in that it spectrally decomposes all specified domains,\nincluding the temporal domain, with multivariate Chebyshev polynomials. The\nCommon Boundary-Condition method (CBC) is a spatial subdomain scheme that\nsolves the physical equations independently from the global connection of\nsubdomains. It is here evaluated against two finite difference methods. For the\nlinearised Burger equation the CBC-GWRM is $\\sim30\\%$ faster and $\\sim50\\%$\nmore memory efficient than the semi implicit Crank-Nicolson method at a maximum\nerror $\\sim10^{-5}$. For a forced wave equation the CBC-GWRM manages to average\nefficiently over the small time-scale in the entire temporal domain. The\nCBC-GWRM is also applied to the linearised ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nequations for a screw pinch equilibrium. The growth rate of the most unstable\nmode was efficiently computed with an error $<0.1\\%$.\n", "  Disputes on the foundations of Quantum Mechanics often involve the conception\nof reality, without a clear definition on which aspect of this broad concept of\nreality one refers. We provide an overview of conceptions of reality in\nclassical physics, in philosophy of science and in Quantum Mechanics and its\ninterpretations and analyse their differences and subtleties. Structural\nrealism as conception in philosophy of science will turn out to be a promising\ncandidate to settle old problems regarding the conception of reality in Quantum\nMechanics. We amend the analysis of three main interpretations and their\nrelation to structural realism by three well-known informational approaches in\nthe interpretations of Quantum Mechanics. Last we propose an additional class\nof structural realism supported by QBism.\n", "  The CERN-Latin-American School of High-Energy Physics is intended to give\nyoung physicists an introduction to the theoretical aspects of recent advances\nin elementary particle physics. These proceedings contain lecture notes on the\nStandard Model of electroweak interactions, flavour physics, neutrino physics,\nHiggs physics, new physics beyond the standard model, quantum chromodynamics\nunder extreme conditions, cosmology, an introduction to experimental facilities\nat the high-energy frontier, and practical statistics for particle physicists.\n", "  We report on the VERITAS detection of very-high-energy (VHE, $E >\n100~\\mathrm{GeV}$) $\\gamma$-ray emission from the optically bright quasar OJ\n287 which is located at a redshift of z = 0.306. OJ 287 has been observed to\ndisplay regular optical outbursts with a period of approximately 12 years, with\nthe last major optical outburst having occurred in 2015. To explain this\nperiodicity, models involving a binary supermassive black hole system at the\ncore of OJ 287, or a helical jet, have been developed. Motivated by elevated\nSwift-XRT count rates, VERITAS observed OJ 287 in February 2017, and detected\nthe object at >5 standard deviations above background. This detection prompted\nfurther VERITAS, Swift-XRT and multiwavelength observations of the object. The\nresults of the VERITAS observational campaign are presented.\n", "  In this study some properties of the methanol-water mixture such as\ndiffusivity, density, viscosity, and hydrogen bonding were calculated at\ndifferent temperatures and atmospheric pressure using molecular dynamics\nsimulations (MDS). The results were compared with the available experimental\ndata as well as some theoretical models, overall indicating a good agreement.\nThis shows the useful and effective application of MDS for determination of\nphysical properties.\n", "  I derive a Fredholm determinant for the thermal correlator of vertex\noperators with a conformally invariant density matrix and nonlinear time\nevolution. Using the method of nonlinear steepest descent I find the long time\nasymptotics at finite temperature. The asymptotics display exponentially small\ncorrections in temperature to the finite temperature mobile impurity\nphenomenology.\n", "  Harnessing short-lived photoexcited electron-hole pairs in metal\nnanostructures has the potential to define a new phase of optoelectronics,\nenabling control of athermal mechanisms for light harvesting, photodetection\nand photocatalysis. To date, however, the spatiotemporal dynamics and transport\nof these photoexcited carriers have been only qualitatively characterized.\nPlasmon excitation has been widely viewed as an efficient mechanism for\ngenerating non-thermal hot carriers. Despite numerous experiments, conclusive\nevidence elucidating and quantifying the full dynamics of hot carrier\ngeneration, transport, and injection has not been reported. Here, we combine\nexperimental measurements with coupled first-principles electronic structure\ntheory and Boltzmann transport calculations to provide unprecedented insight\ninto the internal quantum efficiency, and hence internal physics, of hot\ncarriers in photoexcited gold (Au)-gallium nitride (GaN) nanostructures. Our\nresults indicate that photoexcited electrons generated in 20 nm-thick Au\nnanostructures impinge ballistically on the Au-GaN interface. This discovery\nsuggests that the energy of hot carriers could be harnessed from metal\nnanostructures without substantial losses via thermalization. Measurements and\ncalculations also reveal the important role of metal band structure in hot\ncarrier generation at energies above the interband threshold of the plasmonic\nnanoantenna. Taken together, our results advance the understanding of excited\ncarrier dynamics in realistically-scaled metallic nanostructures and lay the\nfoundations for the design of new optoelectronic devices that operate in the\nballistic regime.\n", "  We investigate the dynamical complexity of Cournot oligopoly dynamics of\nthree firms by using the qualitative methods of dynamical systems to study the\nphase structure of this model. The phase space is organized with\none-dimensional and two-dimensional invariant submanifolds (for the monopoly\nand duopoly) and unique stable node (global attractor) in the positive quadrant\nof the phase space (Cournot equilibrium). We also study the integrability of\nthe system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method of the Darboux\npolynomials in searching for first integrals of the oligopoly. The general\nmethod as well as examples of adopting this method are presented. We study\nDarboux non-integrability of the oligopoly for linear demand functions and find\nfirst integrals of this system for special classes of the system, in\nparticular, rational integrals can be found for a quite general set of model\nparameters. We show how first integral can be useful in lowering the dimension\nof the system using the example of $n$ almost identical firms. This first\nintegral also gives information about the structure of the phase space and the\nbehaviour of trajectories in the neighbourhood of a Nash equilibrium\n", "  Under supercoiling constraints, naked DNA, such as a large part of bacterial\nDNA, folds into braided structures called plectonemes. The double-helix can\nalso undergo local structural transitions, leading to the formation of\ndenaturation bubbles and other alternative structures. Various polymer models\nhave been developed to capture these properties, with Monte-Carlo (MC)\napproaches dedicated to the inference of thermodynamic properties. In this\nchapter, we explain how to perform such Monte-Carlo simulations, following two\nobjectives. On one hand, we present the self-avoiding supercoiled Worm-Like\nChain (ssWLC) model, which is known to capture the folding properties of\nsupercoiled DNA, and provide a detailed explanation of a standard MC simulation\nmethod. On the other hand, we explain how to extend this ssWLC model to include\nstructural transitions of the helix.\n", "  We point out that the polarization state of radiation from a photonic crystal\nslab is strongly constrained by the direct non-resonant scattering process. The\nphase difference between the two linearly-polarized components in the far field\ncan be predicted analytically and is largely independent of the periodic\npattern. We verify the prediction with full-field electromagnetic simulations.\n", "  We report on the fabrication and metrology of superconducting caps for qubit\ncircuits. As part of a 3D quantum integrated circuit architecture, a cap chip\nforms the upper half of an enclosure that provides isolation, increases vacuum\nparticipation ratio, and improves performance of individual resonant elements.\nHere, we demonstrate that such caps can be reliably fabricated, placed on a\ncircuit chip, and form superconducting connections to the circuit.\n", "  We describe a microfabrication process for superconducting through-silicon\nvias appropriate for use in superconducting qubit quantum processors. With a\nsloped-wall via geometry, we can use non-conformal metal deposition methods\nsuch as electron-beam evaporation and sputtering, which reliably deposit high\nquality superconducting films. Via superconductivity is validated by\ndemonstrating zero via-to-via resistance below the critical temperature of\naluminum.\n", "  With an eye towards next-generation, smart, micro/nanofluidic devices,\ncapable of responding to external stimuli or changes in environment, we\ndemonstrate a means to achieve dynamic control of the spatio-temporal\nproperties of the electric field in a standardized microfluidic chamber.\nTypical top-down patterning, currently used to design the field distribution,\nis replaced by freely-suspended colloids which locally disturb the electric\nfield from the bottom-up. Even under uniform forcing, polarization of the\ncolloid induces the formation of strong, three-dimensional gradients at its\nsurface - essentially repurposing it into a portable floating electrode whose\nprecise location can be manipulated to reconfigure the electric field in real\ntime. Focusing on active Janus colloids as a sample platform, we measure the\nstrength of the induced gradients and highlight the advantages of a\ncolloid-based system by revealing a prototype for an all-in-one cargo carrier,\ncapable of on-demand, selective, label-free assembly and transport of\nmicro/nano sized targets.\n", "  Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is now an established technique for\nstatistical inference used in cases where the likelihood function is\ncomputationally expensive or not available. It relies on the use of a model\nthat is specified in the form of a simulator, and approximates the likelihood\nat a parameter $\\theta$ by simulating auxiliary data sets $x$ and evaluating\nthe distance of $x$ from the true data $y$. However, ABC is not computationally\nfeasible in cases where using the simulator for each $\\theta$ is very\nexpensive. This paper investigates this situation in cases where a cheap, but\napproximate, simulator is available. The approach is to employ delayed\nacceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) within an ABC sequential Monte Carlo\n(SMC) sampler in order to, in a first stage of the kernel, use the cheap\nsimulator to rule out parts of the parameter space that are not worth\nexploring, so that the \"true\" simulator is only run (in the second stage of the\nkernel) where there is a reasonable chance of accepting proposed values of\n$\\theta$. We show that this approach can be used quite automatically, with the\nonly tuning parameter choice additional to ABC-SMC being the number of\nparticles we wish to carry through to the second stage of the kernel.\nApplications to stochastic differential equation models and latent doubly\nintractable distributions are presented.\n", "  An incoming gravity wave being a stress wave is a surface with intrinsic\ncurvature. When a light beam is parallel transported on this non-Euclidian\nsurface it acquires an excess phase which accumulates with each curcuit. We\ncalculate the separate contributions to excess phase from the wave geometry as\nwell as the dynamic response of mirrors in a Michelson interferometer. Using\nthese results and a combination of analogue and digital signal processing\ntechniques we show how a compact interferometer can be made sensitive to\ngravity waves of amplitude density $10^{-23}/\\sqrt{Hz}$ within a frequency\nrange $10^{-4}Hz$ to $10^4Hz$. As an example we describe a 10cm Michelson\ninterferometer designed to measure gravity waves from sources as far as the\nVirgo cluster.\n"]}
