The new\nformalism provides an elementary statistical explanation of the modal\nbroadening phenomenon in single pulse observations. It is also used to argue\nthat the degree of polarization of giant pulses has been poorly defined in past\nstudies. Single and giant pulse polarimetry typically involves sources with\nlarge flux densities and observations with high time resolution, factors that\nnecessitate consideration of source-intrinsic noise and small-number\nstatistics. Self noise is shown to fully explain the excess polarization\ndispersion previously noted in single pulse observations of bright pulsars,\nobviating the need for additional randomly polarized radiation. Rather, these\nobservations are more simply interpreted as an incoherent sum of covariant,\northogonal, partially polarized modes. Based on this premise, the\nfour-dimensional covariance matrix of the Stokes parameters may be used to\nderive mode-separated pulse profiles without any assumptions about the\nintrinsic degrees of mode polarization. Finally, utilizing the small-number\nstatistics of the Stokes parameters, it is established that the degree of\npolarization of an unresolved pulse is fundamentally undefined; therefore,\nprevious claims of highly polarized giant pulses are unsubstantiated.\nUnpublished supplementary material is appended after the bibliography.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments, we consider theoretically the compression of\ndroplets pinned at the bottom on a surface of finite area. We show that if the\ndroplet is sufficiently compressed at the top by a surface, it will always\ndevelop a shape instability at a critical compression. When the top surface is\nflat, the shape instability occurs precisely when the apparent contact angle of\nthe droplet at the pinned surface is pi, regardless of the contact angle of the\nupper surface, reminiscent of past work on liquid bridges and sessile droplets\nas first observed by Plateau. After the critical compression, the droplet\ntransitions from a symmetric to an asymmetric shape. The force required to\ndeform the droplet peaks at the critical point then progressively decreases\nindicative of catastrophic buckling. We characterize the transition in droplet\nshape using illustrative examples in two dimensions followed by perturbative\nanalysis as well as numerical simulation in three dimensions. When the upper\nsurface is not flat, the simple apparent contact angle criterion no longer\nholds, and a detailed stability analysis is carried out to predict the critical\ncompression.\n", "  The effect of the finite size of an array of scatterers on the position of\nthe resonance poles of the scattered amplitudes is studied. This effect must be\nstudied because in reality, an infinite array cannot be realized. In\nparticular, it is expected that for a finite array of scatterers, the imaginary\nparts of the resonance poles (resonance widths) cannot vanish as is the case\nfor an infinite double array admitting bound states in the radiation continuum.\n", "  The momentum dependence of the superconducting gap in the cuprates has been\ndebated, with most experiments reporting a deviation from a simple\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$ form in the underdoped regime and a few experiments claiming that\na simple $d_{x^2-y^2}$ form persists down to the lowest dopings. We affirm that\nthe superconducting gap function in sufficiently underdoped\nBi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ (Bi-2212) deviates from a simple\n\\textit{d}-wave form near the antinode. This is observed in samples where\ndoping is controlled only by oxygen annealing, in contrast to claims that this\neffect is only seen in cation-substituted samples. Moreover, a quasiparticle\npeak is present at the antinode down to p$=$0.08, refuting claims that a\ndeviation from a simple \\textit{d}-wave form is a data analysis artifact\nstemming from difficulty in assessing a gap in the absence of a quasiparticle.\n", "  We consider an inflationary universe model in the context of generalized\ncosmic Chaplygin gas by taking matter field as standard and tachyon scalar\nfields. We evaluate the corresponding scalar fields and scalar potentials\nduring intermediate and logamediate inflationary regimes by modifying the first\nFriedmann equation. In each case, we evaluate the number of e-folds, scalar as\nwell as tensor power spectra, scalar spectral index and important observational\nparameter, i.e., tensor-scalar ratio in terms of inflatons. The graphical\nbehavior of this parameter shows that the model remains incompatible with WMAP7\nand Planck observational data in each case.\n", "  The Wigner spacing distribution has a long and illustrious history in nuclear\nphysics and in the quantum mechanics of classically chaotic systems. In this\npaper, a novel connection between the Wigner distribution and 2D classical\nmechanics is introduced. The hypothesis that typical pseudo-trajectories of a\n2D ergodic map have a Wignerian nearest-neighbor spacing distribution is put\nforward and numerically tested. The standard Euclidean metric is used to\ncompute the interpoint spacings. In all test cases, the hypothesis is upheld,\nand the range of validity of the hypothesis appears to be robust in the sense\nthat it is not affected by the presence or absence of: (i) mixing; (ii)\ntime-reversal symmetry; and/or (iii) dissipation.\n", "  This paper introduces an intersection theory problem for maps into a smooth\nmanifold equipped with a stratification. We investigate the problem in the\nspecial case when the target is the unitary group and the domain is a circle.\nThe first main result is an index theorem that equates a global intersection\nindex with a finite sum of locally defined intersection indices. The local\nindices are integers arising from the geometry of the stratification.\n  The result is used to study a well-known problem in chemical physics, namely,\nthe problem of enumerating the electronic excitations (excitons) of a molecule\nequipped with scattering data. We provide a lower bound for this number. The\nbound is shown to be sharp in a limiting case.\n", "  Depositing Au on a graphene derivate, which involves substituting four C\natoms with three N atoms in a $3\\times 3$ cell graphene, we realized a\ntopological insulator of the Kane-Mele model with a gap of 50~meV surrounding\nthe Dirac point of graphene. In this material, we observed an anomalous band\ninversion (BI) protected by the symmetry with character $e$ of group C$_{\\rm\n3V}$. The symmetry constrains two $e$ bands with mirror-symmetry combination\n(MSC) and mirror-antisymmetry combination (MAC) of Au and N orbitals degenerate\nat $\\Gamma$, whereas the interaction of $\\pi^*$ of graphene on the $e$-MAC band\ntends to lift this degenerate, resulting in that the $\\pi^*$ and $e$-MAC band\nexchange their orbital components near $\\Gamma$, causing thus a discontinued\nBI.\n", "  Based on first principles calculations, we predicate that Bi on a graphene\nderivate, $g$-C$_{14}$N$_3$, which involves a $3\\times 3$ unit cell of graphene\nwith four C atoms substituted by three N atoms, is a topological insulator with\na gap of 50~meV. With the help of maximally localized Wannier functions, we\nfind that the band inversion gap can be determined by examining a pair of\ninteraction parameters between the two involved bands. Accordingly, a phase\ndiagram for band inversion of topological materials as a function of the\ninteractions is obtained. The conclusion also holds for Sb, Ir and Rh on\n$g$-C$_{14}$N$_3$. These materials are topological nontrivial either insulator\nor semimetal, indicating that $g$-C$_{14}$N$_3$ is a good platform for\nconceiving topological materials.\n", "  We study the ultraviolet problem for QED in d=3 using Balaban's formulation\nof the renormalization group. The model is defined on a fine toroidal lattice\nand we seek control as the lattice spacing goes to zero. As a first step we\ntake a bounded field approximation and solve the renormalization problem.\nNamely we show that the bare energy density and the bare fermion mass can be\nchosen to depend on the lattice spacing, so that under the renormalization\ngroup flow they take preassigned values on unit scale. This is accomplished by\na nonpertubative technique which is insensitive to whether the renormalizations\nare finite or infinite.\n", "  We develop a location analysis spatial model of firms' competition in\nmulti-characteristics space, where consumers' opinions about the firms'\nproducts are distributed on multilayered networks. Firms do not compete on\nprice but only on location upon the products' multi-characteristics space, and\nthey aim to attract the maximum number of consumers. Boundedly rational\nconsumers have distinct ideal points/tastes over the possible available firm\nlocations but, crucially, they are affected by the opinions of their neighbors.\nProposing a dynamic agent-based analysis on firms' location choice we\ncharacterize multi-dimensional product differentiation competition as adaptive\nlearning by firms' managers and we argue that such a complex systems approach\nadvances the analysis in alternative ways, beyond game-theoretic calculations.\n", "  A hydrodynamic theory of transport in quantum mechanically phase-disordered\nsuperconductors is possible when supercurrent relaxation can be treated as a\nslow process. We obtain general results for the frequency-dependent\nconductivity of such a regime. With time-reversal invariance, the conductivity\nis characterized by a Drude-like peak, with width given by the supercurrent\nrelaxation rate. Using the memory matrix formalism, we obtain a formula for\nthis width (and hence also the dc resistivity) when the supercurrent is relaxed\nby short range Coulomb interactions. This leads to a new -- effective field\ntheoretic and fully quantum -- derivation of a classic result on flux flow\nresistance. With strong breaking of time-reversal invariance, the optical\nconductivity exhibits what we call a `hydrodynamic supercyclotron' resonance.\nWe obtain the frequency and decay rate of this resonance for the case of\nsupercurrent relaxation due to an emergent Chern-Simons gauge field. The\nsupercurrent decay rate in this `topologically ordered superfluid vortex\nliquid' is determined by the conductivities of the normal component of the\nliquid. Our work gives a controlled framework for low temperature metallic\nphases arising from phase-disordered superconductivity.\n", "  This is a survey article for the mathematical theory of Witten's Gauged\nLinear Sigma Model, as developed recently by the authors. Instead of developing\nthe theory in the most general setting, in this paper we focus on the\ndescription of the moduli.\n", "  Heavy fermion materials have recently attracted attention for their potential\nto combine topological protection with strongly correlated electron physics. To\ndate, the ideas of topological protection have been restricted to the heavy\nfermion or \"Kondo\" insulators with the simplest point-group symmetries. Here we\nargue that the presence of nonsymmorphic crystal symmetries in many heavy\nfermion materials opens up a new family of topologically protected heavy\nelectron systems. Re-examination of archival resistivity measurements in\nnonsymmorphic heavy fermion insulators Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$ and CeNiSn reveals\nthe presence of low temperature conductivity plateau, making them candidate\nmembers of the new class of material. We illustrate our ideas with a specific\nmodel for CeNiSn, showing how glide symmetries generate surface states with a\nnovel Mobius braiding that can be detected by ARPES or non-local conductivity\nmeasurements. One of the interesting effects of strong correlation, is the\ndevelopment of partially localization or \"Kondo breakdown\" on the surfaces,\nwhich transforms Mobius surface states into quasi-one dimensional conductors,\nwith the potential for novel electronic phase transitions.\n", "  Understanding the behavior of interacting fermions is of fundamental interest\nin many fields ranging from condensed matter to high energy physics. Developing\nnumerically efficient and accurate simulation methods is an indispensable part\nof this. Already in equilibrium, fermions are notoriously hard to handle due to\nthe sign problem. Out of equilibrium, an important outstanding problem is the\nefficient numerical simulation of the dynamics of these systems. In this work\nwe develop a new semiclassical phase-space approach (a.k.a. the truncated\nWigner approximation) for simulating the dynamics of interacting fermions in\narbitrary dimensions. As fermions are essentially non-classical objects, a\nphase-space is constructed out of all fermionic bilinears. Classical\nphase-space is thus comprised of highly non-local (hidden) variables\nrepresenting these bilinears, and the cost of the method is that it scales\nquadratic rather than linear with system size. We demonstrate the strength of\nthe method by comparing the results to the exact quantum dynamics of fermion\nexpansion in the Hubbard model and quantum thermalization in the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for small systems, where the semiclassics nearly\nperfectly reproduces correct results. We furthermore analyze fermion expansion\nin a larger, intractable by exact methods, 2D Hubbard model, which is directly\nrelevant to recent cold atom experiments.\n", "  We extend the characterization of the integrability of an almost complex\nstructure $J$ on differentiable manifolds via the vanishing of the\nFr\\\"olicher-Nijenhuis bracket $[J, J] ^{FN}$ to an analogous characterization\nof torsion-free $G_2$-structures and torsion-free Spin(7)-structures. We also\nexplain the Fern\\'andez-Gray classification of $G_2$-structures and the\nFern\\'andez classification of Spin(7)-structures in terms of the\nFr\\\"olicher-Nijenhuis bracket.\n", "  In many models in condensed matter physics and high-energy physics, one finds\ninhomogeneous phases at high density and low temperature. These phases are\ncharacterized by a spatially dependent condensate or order parameter. A proper\ncalculation requires that one takes the vacuum fluctuations of the model into\naccount. These fluctuations are ultraviolet divergent and must be regularized.\nWe discuss different consistent ways of regularizing and renormalizing quantum\nfluctuations, focusing on a symmetric energy cutoff scheme and dimensional\nregularization. We apply these techniques calculating the vacuum energy in the\nNJL model in 1+1 dimensions in the large-$N_c$ limit and the 3+1 dimensional\nquark-meson model in the mean-field approximation both for a one-dimensional\nchiral-density wave.\n", "  In this theoretical study, we report an investigation of the equations of\nstate (EoSs) ofhyper-nuclear matter and its composition as a function of\ndensity within the framework of effective field theory motivated relativistic\nmean field model. We have used G2 force parameter along with various\nhyperon-meson coupling ratios by allowing the mixing and the breaking of SU(6)\nsymmetry to predict the EoSs, keeping the nucleonic coupling constant intact.\nWe have estimated the properties of non-rotating and rapidly rotating\nconfiguration of compact stars by employing four different representative sets\nof equations of state. The obtained results of the mass and radius for the\ncompact stars are compared with the recent mass observations. Further, we have\nstudied the stability and sensitivity of rotational frequency (at\nsub-millisecond period) on the configuration of the compact stars, because the\nangular frequency is significantly smaller than the mass-shedding (Keplerian)\nfrequency in slow rotation regime. Moreover, the yield of hyperon as a function\nof density for various hyperon-meson couplings are also estimated.\n", "  Quantum spin networks overcome the challenges of traditional charge-based\nelectronics by encoding the information into spin degrees of freedom. Although\nbeneficial for transmitting information with minimal losses when compared to\ntheir charge-based counterparts, the mathematical formalization of the\ninformation propagation in a spin(tronic) network is challenging due to its\ncomplicated scaling properties. In this paper, we propose a geometric\napproach---specific to finite networks---for unraveling the\ninformation-theoretic phenomena of spin chains and rings by abstracting them as\nweighted graphs, where the vertices correspond to the spin excitation states\nand the edges represent the information theoretic distance between pair of\nnodes. The weighted graph representation of the quantum spin network dynamics\nexhibits a complex self-similar structure (where subgraphs repeat to some\nextent over various space scales). To quantify this complex behavior, we\ndevelop a new box counting inspired algorithm which assesses the mono-fractal\nversus multi-fractal properties of quantum spin networks. Besides specific to\nfinite networks, multi-fractality is further compounded by \"engineering\" or\n\"biasing\" the network for selective transfer, as selectivity makes the network\nmore heterogeneous. To demonstrate criticality in finite size systems, we\ndefine a thermodynamics inspired framework for describing information\npropagation and show evidence that some spin chains and rings exhibit an\ninformational phase transition phenomenon, akin to the metal-to-insulator phase\ntransition in Anderson localization in finite media.}\n", "  Particle production from an expanding classical color electromagnetic field\nis extensively studied, motivated by the early stage dynamics of\nultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. We develop a formalism at one-loop\norder to compute the particle spectra by canonically quantizing quark, gluon\nand ghost fluctuations under the presence of such an expanding classical color\nbackground field; the canonical quantization is done in the $\\tau$-$\\eta$\ncoordinates in order to take into account manifestly the expanding geometry. As\na demonstration, we model the expanding classical color background field by a\nboost-invariantly expanding homogeneous color electric field with lifetime $T$,\nfor which we obtain analytically the quark and gluon production spectra by\nsolving the equations of motion of QCD non-perturbatively with respect to the\ncolor electric field. In this paper we study (i) finite lifetime effect which\nis found to modify significantly the particle spectra from those expected from\nthe Schwinger formula; (ii) the difference between the quark and gluon\nproduction; and (iii) the quark mass dependence of the production spectra.\nImplications of these results to ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions are\nalso discussed.\n", "  We carry out the Kerr/CFT correspondence in a four-dimensional extremal\nrotating regular black hole with a non-linear magnetic monopole (NLMM). One\nproblem in this study would be whether our geometry can be a solution or not.\nWe search for the way making our rotating geometry into a solution based on the\nfact that the Schwarzschild regular black hole geometry with a NLMM can be a\nsolution. However, in the attempt to extend the Schwarzschild case that we can\nnaturally consider, it turns out that it is impossible to construct a model in\nwhich our geometry can be a exact solution. We manage this problem by making\nuse of the fact that our geometry can be a solution approximately in the whole\nspace-time except for the black hole's core region. As a next problem, it turns\nout that the equation to obtain the horizon radii is given by a fifth-order\nequation due to the regularization effect. We overcome this problem by treating\nthe regularization effect perturbatively. As a result, we can obtain the\nnear-horizon extremal Kerr (NHEK) geometry with the correction of the\nregularization effect. Once obtaining the NHEK geometry, we can obtain the\ncentral charge and the Frolov-Thorne temperature in the dual CFT. Using these,\nwe compute its entropy through the Cardy formula, which agrees with the one\ncomputed from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.\n", "  We report the structural and magnetic properties of the\n4}\\textit{\\textcolor{black}{d }}\\textcolor{black}{(M = Rh) based and\n5}\\textit{\\textcolor{black}{d }}\\textcolor{black}{(M = Ir) based systems\nBa$_{3}$M$_{x}$Ti$_{3-x}$O$_{9}$ (nominally $x$ = 0.5, 1). The studied\ncompositions were found to crystallize in a hexagonal structure with the\ncentrosymmetric space group }$P6_{3}/mmc$.\\textcolor{black}{{} The structures\ncomprise of A$_{2}$O$_{9}$ polyhedra (with the A site (possibly) statistically\noccupied by M and Ti) in which pairs of transition metal ions are stacked along\nthe crystallographic }\\textit{\\textcolor{black}{c}}\\textcolor{black}{-axis.\nThese pairs form triangular bilayers in the $ab$-plane. The magnetic Rh and Ir\nions occupy these bilayers, diluted by Ti ions even for $x$ = 1. These bilayers\nare separated by a triangular layer which is dominantly occupied by Ti ions.\nFrom magnetization measurements we infer strong antiferromagnetic couplings for\nall of the materials but the absence of any spin-freezing or spin-ordering down\nto 2~K. Further, specific heat measurements down to 0.35~K show no sign of a\nphase transition for any of the compounds. Based on these thermodynamic\nmeasurements we propose the emergence of a quantum spin liquid ground state for\nBa$_{3}$Rh$_{0.5}$Ti$_{2.5}$O$_{9}$, and Ba$_{3}$Ir$_{0.5}$Ti$_{2.5}$O$_{9}$,\nin addition to the already reported Ba$_{3}$IrTi$_{2}$O$_{9}$. }\n", "  Minimal models of active and driven particles have recently been used to\nelucidate many properties non-equilibrium systems. However, the relation\nbetween energy consumption and changes in the structure and transport\nproperties of these non-equilibrium materials remains to be explored. We\nexplore this relation in a minimal model of a driven liquid that settles into a\ntime periodic steady state. Using concepts from stochastic thermodynamics and\nliquid state theories, we show how the work performed on the system by the\nvarious non-conservative, time dependent forces - this quantifies a violation\nof time reversal symmetry - modifies the structural, transport, and phase\ntransition properties of the driven liquid\n", "  It is generally assumed that the sources of Fast Radio Bursts radiate roughly\nisotropically, so that the observed low duty cycle of any individual source\nindicates a similar low duty cycle of its radio-frequency emission. An\nalternative hypothesis is that the radiative duty cycle is ${\\cal O}(1)$, but\nthat the radiation is emitted in a beam with a solid angle comparable to the\nobserved duty cycle, whose direction wanders or sweeps across the sky. This\nhypothesis relaxes the extreme power demands of isotropically radiating models\nof FRB at the price of multiplying the number of sources. The constraints on\npulsar models are relaxed; rather than being unprecedentedly fast-spinning and\nhighly-magnetized with short spin-down times, their parameters may be closer to\nthose of typical radio pulsars. The nanoshots of Galactic pulsars pose\nanalogous energetic problems that may be resolved if their emission also is\nbeamed, suggesting a relation between these phenomena, despite their vastly\ndifferent energy scales.\n", "  It is shown that the formulation of the SU(3) Yang-Mills quantum Hamiltonian\nin the \"flux-tube gauge\" $A_{a1}=0$ for all a=1,2,4,5,6,7 and $A_{a2}=0$ for\nall a=5,7 allows for a systematic and practical strong coupling expansion of\nthe Hamiltonian in $\\lambda\\equiv g^{-2/3}$, equivalent to an expansion in the\nnumber of spatial derivatives. Introducing an infinite spatial lattice with box\nlength a, the \"free part\" is the sum of Hamiltonians of Yang-Mills quantum\nmechanics of constant fields for each box, and the \"interaction terms\" contain\nhigher and higher number of spatial derivatives connecting different boxes. The\nFaddeev-Popov operator, its determinant and inverse, are rather simple, but\nshow a highly non-trivial periodic structure of six Gribov-horizons separating\nsix Weyl-chambers. The energy eigensystem of the gauge reduced Hamiltonian of\nSU(3) Yang-Mills mechanics of spatially constant fields can be calculated in\nprinciple with arbitrary high precision using the orthonormal basis of all\nsolutions of the corresponding harmonic oscillator problem, which turn out to\nbe made of orthogonal polynomials of the 35 components of seven elementary\nspatial tensors. First results for the spectrum are in excellent agreement with\nthose obtained by Weisz and Ziemann using the unreduced approach. Thus, the\ngauge reduced approach using the flux-tube gauge proposed here, is expected to\nenable one to obtain valuable non-perturbative information about low-energy\nglueball dynamics, using perturbation theory in $\\lambda$.\n", "  The analytical formalism to obtain the probability distribution functions\n(PDFs) of spherically-averaged cosmic densities and velocity divergences in the\nmildly non-linear regime is presented. A large-deviation principle is applied\nto those cosmic fields assuming their most likely dynamics in spheres is set by\nthe spherical collapse model. We validate our analytical results using\nstate-of-the-art dark matter simulations with a phase-space resolved velocity\nfield finding a 2% percent level agreement for a wide range of velocity\ndivergences and densities in the mildly nonlinear regime (~10Mpc/h at redshift\nzero), usually inaccessible to perturbation theory. From the joint PDF of\ndensities and velocity divergences measured in two concentric spheres, we\nextract with the same accuracy velocity profiles and conditional velocity PDF\nsubject to a given over/under-density which are of interest to understand the\nnon-linear evolution of velocity flows. Both PDFs are used to build a simple\nbut accurate maximum likelihood estimators for the redshift evolution of the\nvariance of both the density and velocity divergence fields, which have smaller\nrelative errors than their sample variances when non-linearities appear. Given\nthe dependence of the velocity divergence on the growth rate, there is a\nsignificant gain in using the full knowledge of both PDFs to derive constraints\non the equation of state of dark energy. Thanks to the insensitivity of the\nvelocity divergence to bias, its PDF can be used to obtain unbiased constraints\non the growth of structures ($\\sigma_8$,f) or it can be combined with the\ngalaxy density PDF to extract bias parameters.\n", "  Here we describe how, utilizing a time-dependent opto-mechanical interaction,\na mechanical probe can provide an amplified measurement of the virtual photons\ndressing the quantum ground state of an ultra strongly-coupled light-matter\nsystem. We calculate the thermal noise tolerated by this measurement scheme,\nand discuss a range of experimental setups in which it could be realized.\n", "  A search for time-integrated $CP$ violation in the Cabibbo-suppressed decay\n$\\mbox{$D^0\\rightarrow\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$}$ is performed using an unbinned,\nmodel-independent technique known as the energy test. This is the first\napplication of the energy test in four-body decays. The search is performed for\n$P$-even $CP$ asymmetries and, for the first time, is extended to probe the\n$P$-odd case. Using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 3.0 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb detector at centre-of-mass\nenergies of $\\sqrt{s}=$7 TeV and 8 TeV, the world's best sensitivity to $CP$\nviolation in this decay is obtained. The data are found to be consistent with\nthe hypothesis of $CP$ symmetry with a $p$-value of $(4.6\\pm0.5)\\%$ in the\n$P$-even case, and marginally consistent with a $p$-value of $(0.6\\pm0.2)\\%$ in\nthe $P$-odd case, corresponding to a significance for $CP$ non-conservation of\n2.7 standard deviations.\n", "  Supervised learning with a deep convolutional neural network is used to\nidentify the QCD equation of state (EoS) employed in relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulations of heavy-ion collisions from the simulated final-state particle\nspectra $\\rho(p_T,\\Phi)$. High-level correlations of $\\rho(p_T,\\Phi)$ learned\nby the neural network act as an effective \"EoS-meter\" in detecting the nature\nof the QCD transition. The EoS-meter is model independent and insensitive to\nother simulation inputs, especially the initial conditions. Thus it provides a\npowerful direct-connection of heavy-ion collision observables with the bulk\nproperties of QCD.\n", "  We study spinless fermions with repulsive nearest-neighbor interactions\nperturbed by an impurity particle or a local potential quench. Using the\nnumerical time-evolving block decimation method and a simplified analytic\nmodel, we show that the pertubations create a soliton-antisoliton pair. If\nsolitons are already present in the bath, the two excitations have a\ndrastically different dynamics: The antisoliton does not annihilate with the\nsolitons and is therefore confined close to its origin while the soliton\nexcitation propagates. We discuss the consequences for experiments with\nultracold gases.\n", "  Most of the research concerting crack propagation in discrete media is\nconcerned with specific types of external loading: displacements on the\nboundaries, or constant energy fluxes or feeding waves originating from\ninfinity. In this paper the action of a moving load is analysed on the simplest\nlattice model: a thin strip, where the fault propagating in its middle portion\nas the result of the moving force acting on the destroyed part of the\nstructure. We study both analytically and numerically how the load amplitude\nand its velocity influence the possible solution, and specifically the way the\nfracture process reaches its steady-state regime. We present the relation\nbetween the possible steady-state crack speed and the loading parameters, as\nwell as the energy release rate. In particular, we show that there exists a\nclass of loading regime corresponding to each point on the energy-speed diagram\n(and thus determine the same limiting steady-state regime). The phenomenon of\nthe forbidden regimes is discussed in detail, from both the points of view of\nforce and energy. For a sufficiently anisotropic structure, we find a stable\nsteady-state propagation corresponding to the slow crack. Numerical simulations\nreveal various ways by which the process approaches - or fails to approach -\nthe steady-state regime. The results extend our understanding of fracture\nprocesses in discrete structures, and reveal some new questions that should be\naddressed.\n", "  The rise in global mean temperature is an incomplete description of warming.\nFor many purposes, including agriculture and human life, temperature extremes\nmay be more important than temperature means and changes in local extremes may\nbe more important than mean global changes. We define a nonparametric statistic\nto describe extreme temperature behavior by quantifying the frequency of local\ndaily all-time highs and lows, normalized by their frequency in the null\nhypothesis of no climate change. We average this metric over 1218 weather\nstations in the 48 contiguous United States, and find significantly fewer\nall-time lows than for the null hypothesis of unchanging climate. Record highs,\nby contrast, exhibit no significant trend. The metric is evaluated by Monte\nCarlo simulation for stationary and warming temperature distributions,\npermitting comparison of the statistics of historic temperature records with\nthose of modeled behavior.\n", "  Optical coherence lifetimes and decoherence processes in erbium-doped lithium\nniobate (Er$^{3+}$:LiNbO$_3$) crystalline powders are investigated for\nmaterials that underwent different mechanical and thermal treatments. Several\ncomplimentary methods are used to assess the coherence lifetimes for these\nhighly scattering media. Direct intensity or heterodyne detection of two-pulse\nphoton echo techniques was employed for samples with longer coherence lifetimes\nand larger signal strengths, while time-delayed optical free induction decays\nwere found to work well for shorter coherence lifetimes and weaker signal\nstrengths. Spectral hole burning techniques were also used to characterize\nsamples with very rapid dephasing processes. The results on powders are\ncompared to the properties of a bulk crystal, with observed differences\nexplained by the random orientation of the particles in the powders combined\nwith new decoherence mechanisms introduced by the powder fabrication. Modeling\nof the coherence decay shows that paramagnetic materials such as\nEr$^{3+}$:LiNbO$_3$ that have highly anisotropic interactions with an applied\nmagnetic field can still exhibit long coherence lifetimes and relatively simple\ndecay shapes even for a powder of randomly oriented particles. We find that\ncoherence properties degrade rapidly from mechanical treatment when grinding\npowders from bulk samples, leading to the appearance of amorphous-like behavior\nand a broadening of up to three orders of magnitude for the homogeneous\nlinewidth even when low-energy grinding methods are employed. Annealing at high\ntemperatures can improve the properties in some samples, with homogeneous\nlinewidths reduced to less than 10 kHz, approaching the bulk crystal linewidth\nof 3 kHz under the same experimental conditions.\n", "  There are striking phenomenological similarities between Fast Radio Bursts\nand lightning in the Earth's and planetary atmospheres. Both have very low duty\nfactors, $\\lesssim 10^{-8}$--$10^{-5}$ for FRB and (very roughly) $\\sim\n10^{-4}$ for the main return strokes in an active thundercloud. Lightning\noccurs in an electrified insulating atmosphere when a conducting path is\ncreated by and permits current flow. FRB may occur in neutron star\nmagnetospheres whose plasma is believed to be divided by vacuum gaps. Vacuum is\na perfect insulator unless electric fields are sufficient for electron-positron\npair production by curvature radiation, a high-energy analogue of electrostatic\nbreakdown in an insulating gas. FRB may be \"electrars\" powered by the release\nof stored electrostatic energy, counterparts to Soft Gamma Repeaters powered by\nthe release of stored magnetostatic energy (magnetars). This frees pulsar FRB\nmodels from the constraint that their power not exceed the instantaneous\nspin-down power. Energetic constraints imply that the sources of more energetic\nFRB have shorter spin-down lifetimes, perhaps shorter than the three years over\nwhich FRB 121102 has been observed to repeat.\n", "  Originating from a broken spatial inversion symmetry, ferroelectricity is a\nfunctionality of materials with an electric dipole that can be switched by\nexternal electric fields. Spontaneous polarization is a crucial ferroelectric\nproperty, and its amplitude is determined by the strength of polar structural\ndistortions. Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most widely used\ntheoretical methods to study ferroelectric properties, yet it is limited by the\nlevels of approximations in electron exchange-correlation. On the one hand, the\nlocal density approximation (LDA) is considered to be more accurate for the\nconventional perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3 and PbTiO3 than the\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA), which suffers from the so-called\nsuper-tetragonality error. On the other hand, GGA is more suitable for\nhydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics than LDA, which largely overestimates the\nstrength of hydrogen bonding in general. We show here that the recently\ndeveloped general-purpose strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN)\nmeta-GGA functional significantly improves over the traditional LDA/GGA for\nstructural, electric, and energetic properties of diversely-bonded\nferroelectric materials with a comparable computational effort, and thus\nenhances largely the predictive power of DFT in studies of ferroelectric\nmaterials. We also address the observed system-dependent performances of LDA\nand GGA for ferroelectrics from a chemical bonding point of view.\n", "  We prove that the entanglement entropy of any state evolved under an\narbitrary $1/r^{\\alpha}$ long-range-interacting D-dimensional lattice spin\nHamiltonian cannot change faster than a rate proportional to the boundary area\nfor any $\\alpha>D+1$. We also prove that for any $\\alpha>2D+2$, the ground\nstate of such a Hamiltonian satisfies the entanglement area law if it can be\ntransformed along a gapped adiabatic path into a ground state known to satisfy\nthe area law. These results significantly generalize their existing\ncounterparts for short-range interacting systems, and are useful for\nidentifying dynamical phase transitions and quantum phase transitions in the\npresence of long-range interactions.\n", "  We present optimal control protocols to prepare different many-body quantum\nstates of Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. Specifically, we show how to\nprepare highly ordered many-body ground states, GHZ states as well as some\nsuperposition of symmetric excitation number Fock states, that inherit the\ntranslational symmetry from the Hamiltonian, within sufficiently short\nexcitation times minimizing detrimental decoherence effects. For the GHZ\nstates, we propose a two-step detection protocol to experimentally verify the\noptimal preparation of the target state based only on standard measurement\ntechniques. Realistic experimental constraints and imperfections are taken into\naccount by our optimization procedure making it applicable to ongoing\nexperiments.\n", "  New results are reported from the operation of the PICO-60 dark matter\ndetector, a bubble chamber filled with 52 kg of C$_3$F$_8$ located in the\nSNOLAB underground laboratory. As in previous PICO bubble chambers, PICO-60\nC$_3$F$_8$ exhibits excellent electron recoil and alpha decay rejection, and\nthe observed multiple-scattering neutron rate indicates a single-scatter\nneutron background of less than 1 event per month. A blind analysis of an\nefficiency-corrected 1167-kg-day exposure at a 3.3-keV thermodynamic threshold\nreveals no single-scattering nuclear recoil candidates, consistent with the\npredicted background. These results set the most stringent direct-detection\nconstraint to date on the WIMP-proton spin-dependent cross section at 3.4\n$\\times$ 10$^{-41}$ cm$^2$ for a 30-GeV$\\thinspace$c$^{-2}$ WIMP, more than one\norder of magnitude improvement from previous PICO results.\n", "  Motivated by the experimental realization of quantum spin models of polar\nmolecule KRb in optical lattices, we analyze the spin 1/2 dipolar Heisenberg\nmodel with competing anisotropic, long-range exchange interactions. We show\nthat, by tilting the orientation of dipoles using an external electric field,\nthe dipolar spin system on square lattice comes close to a maximally frustrated\nregion similar, but not identical, to that of the $J_1$-$J_2$ model. This\nprovides a simple yet powerful route to potentially realize a quantum spin\nliquid without the need for a triangular or kagome lattice. The ground state\nphase diagrams obtained from Schwinger-boson and spin-wave theories\nconsistently show a spin disordered region between the N$\\acute{\\textrm{e}}$el,\nstripe, and spiral phase. The existence of a finite quantum paramagnetic region\nis further confirmed by an unbiased variational ansatz based on tensor network\nstates and a tensor renormalization group.\n", "  In this paper, we study the various cylindrical solutions (cosmic strings) in\ngravity's rainbow scenario. In particular, we calculate the gravitational field\nequations corresponding to energy-dependent background. Further, we discuss the\npossible Kasner, quasi-Kasner and non-Kasner exact solutions of the field\nequations. In this framework, we find that quasi-Kasner solutions can not be\nrealized in gravity's rainbow. Assuming only time-dependent metric functions,\nwe also analyse the time-dependent vacuum cosmic strings in gravity's rainbow,\nwhich are completely different than the other GR solutions.\n", "  We study the entanglement between the internal (spin) and external (position)\ndegrees of freedom of the one-dimensional discrete time quantum walk starting\nfrom local and delocalized initial states whose time evolution is driven by\nHadamard and Fourier coins. We obtain the dependence of the asymptotic\nentanglement with the initial dispersion of the state and establish a way to\nconnect the asymptotic entanglement between local and delocalized states. We\nfind out that the delocalization of the state increases the number of initial\nspin states which achieves maximal entanglement from two states (local) to a\ncontinuous set of spin states (delocalized) given by a simple relation between\nthe angles of the initial spin state. We also carry out numerical simulations\nof the average entanglement along the time to confront with our analytical\nresults.\n", "  We compare the relation between dispersion and dissipation for two random\nvariables that can be used to characterize the precision of a Brownian clock.\nThe first random variable is the current between states. In this case, a\ncertain precision requires a minimal energetic cost determined by a known\nthermodynamic uncertainty relation. We introduce a second random variable that\nis a certain linear combination of two random variables, each of which is the\ntime a stochastic trajectory spends in a state. Whereas the first moment of\nthis random variable is equal to the average probability current, its\ndispersion is generally different from the dispersion associated with the\ncurrent. Remarkably, for this second random variable a certain precision can be\nobtained with an arbitrarily low energy dissipation, in contrast to the\nthermodynamic uncertainty relation for the current. As a main technical\nachievement, we provide an exact expression for the dispersion related to the\ntime that a stochastic trajectory spends in a cluster of states for a general\nunicyclic network.\n", "  We consider a many-body system of fermionic atoms interacting via a local\npair potential and subject to an external potential within the framework of BCS\ntheory. We measure the free energy of the whole sample with respect to the free\nenergy of a reference state which allows us to define a BCS functional with\nboundary conditions at infinity. Our main result is a lower bound for this\nenergy functional in terms of expressions that typically appear in\nGinzburg-Landau functionals.\n", "  This tutorial review presents an overview of the basic theoretical aspects of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) crystals. We revise essential aspects of graphene and the\nnew families of semiconducting 2D materials, like transition metal\ndichalcogenides or black phosphorus. Minimal theoretical models for various\nmaterials are presented. Some of the exciting new possibilities offered by 2D\ncrystals are discussed, such as manipulation and control of quantum degrees of\nfreedom (spin and pseudospin), confinement of excitons, control of the\nelectronic and optical properties with strain engineering, or unconventional\nsuperconducting phases.\n", "  We provide a synthesis model demonstrating the \"fast dynamo\" action of the\nSun. The latter is essentially accomplished via two toroidal structures\npresumably formed in the tachocline and placed symmetrically with respect to\nthe equatorial plane. The two tori are characterized by several prominent\nkey-properties as follows: First, in each \"Torus\" a surplus charge is entrapped\nfor the time period of an 11-year sunspot cycle; for the next cycle the charge\nchanges sign. Second, the net charge of Torus, moving with the solar rotational\nspeed (U), generates a huge toroidal current which, in turn, builds up an\nintense poloidal magnetic field. Third, each Torus is placed at a specific\ndistance from the Radiative Zone, so that the U of an entrapped charge carrier\nequals the local propagation velocity for an electromagnetic disturbance (v).\nThus, two Torus electrons satisfy the condition that the repulsive\nelectrostatic force equals the attractive magnetic force caused from the two\nelementary currents. Fourth, the surplus charge steadily increases; electrons\nare systematically attracted inwards or repealed outwards via the poloidal\nfield. The charges remain without any \"Debye shielding\" action in the\nTorus-core region, while they demonstrate a \"Debye anti-shielding effect\"\ncloser to the Radiative Zone. Thus, the Torus charge \"moves\" with zero\nresistivity and rotational speed U; the Torus core region behaves like a\ngigantic superconductor at the extremely high temperatures of tachocline.\nFifth, the tori move equatorward drifting on a surface being an ellipsoid by\nrevolution on which the condition U=v is satisfied. Moreover, we present a\npreliminary 3D solar circuit with the ability to reverse the magnetic field in\neach 22-year cycle. Finally, we discuss many longstanding unresolved questions\nin the context of the proposed model.\n", "  Biological locomotion in nature is often achieved by the interaction between\na flexible body and its surrounding medium. The interaction of a flexible body\nwith granular media is less understood compared with viscous fluids partially\ndue to its complex rheological properties. In this work we explore the effect\nof flexibility on granular propulsion by considering a simple mechanical model\nwhere a rigid rod is connected to a torsional spring that is under a\ndisplacement actuation using a granular resistive force theory. Through a\ncombined numerical and asymptotic investigation, we characterize the propulsive\ndynamics of such a flexible flapper in relation to the actuation amplitude and\nspring stiffness and compare these dynamics with those observed in a viscous\nfluid. In addition, we demonstrate that the maximum possible propulsive force\ncan be obtained in the steady propulsion limit with a finite spring stiffness\nand large actuation amplitude. These results may apply to the development of\nsynthetic locomotive systems that exploit flexibility to move through complex\nterrestrial media.\n", "  In all supersymmetric theories, gravitinos, with mass suppressed by the\nPlanck scale, are an obvious candidate for dark matter; but if gravitinos ever\nreached thermal equilibrium, such dark matter is apparently either too abundant\nor too hot, and is excluded. However, in theories with an axion, a saxion\ncondensate is generated during an early era of cosmological history and its\nlate decay dilutes dark matter. We show that such dilution allows previously\nthermalized gravitinos to account for the observed dark matter over very wide\nranges of gravitino mass, keV < $m_{3/2}$ < TeV, axion decay constant, $10^9$\nGeV < $f_a$ < $10^{16}$ GeV, and saxion mass, 10 MeV < $m_s$ < 100 TeV.\nConstraints on this parameter space are studied from BBN, supersymmetry\nbreaking, gravitino and axino production from freeze-in and saxion decay, and\nfrom axion production from both misalignment and parametric resonance\nmechanisms. Large allowed regions of $(m_{3/2}, f_a, m_s)$ remain, but differ\nfor DFSZ and KSVZ theories. Superpartner production at colliders may lead to\nevents with displaced vertices and kinks, and may contain saxions decaying to\n$(WW,ZZ,hh), gg, \\gamma \\gamma$ or a pair of Standard Model fermions. Freeze-in\nmay lead to a sub-dominant warm component of gravitino dark matter, and saxion\ndecay to axions may lead to dark radiation.\n", "  Collective measurements on large quantum systems together with a majority\nvoting strategy can lead to a violation of the CHSH Bell inequality. In\npresence of many entangled pairs, this violation decreases quickly with the\nnumber of pairs, and vanishes for some critical pair number that is a function\nof the noise present in the system. Here, we show that a different binning\nstrategy can lead to a more substantial Bell violation when the noise is\nsufficiently small. Given the relation between the critical pair number and the\nsource noise, we then present an experiment where the critical pair number is\nused to quantify the quality of a high visibility photon pair source. Our\nresults demonstrate nonlocal correlations using collective measurements\noperating on clusters of more than 40 photon pairs.\n", "  We consider two-qubit undergoing local dissipation and subject to local\ndriving. We then determine the optimal Markovian feedback action to preserve\ninitial entanglement as well as to create stationary entanglement with the help\nof an XY interaction Hamiltonian. Such feedback actions are worked out in a way\nnot depending on the initial two-qubit state, whence called universal.\n", "  Electronic, lattice, and spin interactions at the interfaces between\ncrystalline complex transition metal oxides can give rise to a wide range of\nfunctional electronic and magnetic phenomena not found in bulk. At\nhetero-interfaces, these interactions may be enhanced by combining oxides where\nthe polarity changes at the interface. The physical structure between non-polar\nSrTiO$_3$ and polar La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$(x=0.2) is investigated using high\nresolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction to directly determine the role of\nstructure in compensating the polar discontinuity. At both the oxide-oxide\ninterface and vacuum-oxide interfaces, the lattice is found to expand and\nrumple along the growth direction. The SrTiO$_3$/La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$\ninterface also exhibits intermixing of La and Sr over a few unit cells. The\nresults, hence, demonstrate that polar distortions and ionic intermixing\ncoexist and both pathways play a significant role at interfaces with polar\ndiscontinuities.\n", "  We discuss dynamical response functions near quantum critical points,\nallowing for both a finite temperature and detuning by a relevant operator.\nWhen the quantum critical point is described by a conformal field theory (CFT),\nconformal perturbation theory and the operator product expansion can be used to\nfix the first few leading terms at high frequencies. Knowledge of the high\nfrequency response allows us then to derive non-perturbative sum rules. We\nshow, via explicit computations, how holography recovers the general results of\nCFT, and the associated sum rules, for any holographic field theory with a\nconformal UV completion -- regardless of any possible new ordering and/or\nscaling physics in the IR. We numerically obtain holographic response functions\nat all frequencies, allowing us to probe the breakdown of the asymptotic\nhigh-frequency regime. Finally, we show that high frequency response functions\nin holographic Lifshitz theories are quite similar to their conformal\ncounterparts, even though they are not strongly constrained by symmetry.\n", "  We compute the two-loop anomalous dimension matrix in the scalar sector of\nplanar ${\\cal N}=3$ flavored ABJM theory. Using coordinate Bethe ansatz, we\nobtain the reflection matrix and confirm that the boundary Yang-Baxter\nequations are satisfied. This establishes the integrability of this theory in\nthe scalar sector at the two-loop order.\n", "  In conventional superconductors, very narrow superconducting fluctuation\nregions are observed above $T_c$ because of the strong overlapping of Cooper\npairs in a coherence volume. In the bulk form of iron chalcogenide\nsuperconductor FeSe, it is argued that the system may locate in the crossover\nregion of BCS to BEC, indicating a strong superconducting fluctuation. In this\nrespect, we have carried out measurements of magnetization, specific heat and\nNernst effect on FeSe single crystals in order to investigate the\nsuperconducting fluctuation effect near $T_c$. The region of diamagnetization\ninduced by superconducting fluctuation seems very narrow above $T_c$. The\ncrossing point of temperature dependent magnetization curves measured at\ndifferent magnetic fields, which appears in many systems of cuprate\nsuperconductors and is regarded as indication of strong critical fluctuation,\nis however absent. The magnetization data can be scaled based on the\nGinzburg-Landau fluctuation theory for a quasi-two-dimensional system, but the\nscaling result cannot be described by the theoretical function of the\nfluctuation theory because of the limited fluctuation regions. The specific\nheat jump near $T_c$ is rather sharp without the trace of strong\nsuperconducting fluctuation. This is also supported by the Nernst effect\nmeasurements which indicate a very limited region for vortex motion above\n$T_c$. Associated with very small value of Ginzburg number and further\nanalyses, we conclude that the superconducting fluctuation is very weak above\n$T_c$ in this material. Our results are strongly against the picture of\nsignificant phase fluctuation in FeSe single crystals, although the system has\na very limited overlapping of Cooper pairs in the coherence volume. This\ndichotomy provides new insights into the superconducting mechanism when the\nsystem is with a dilute superfluid density.\n", "  We study the statistical and dynamical aspects of a translation-invariant\nHamiltonian, without quench disorder, as an example of the manifestation of the\nphenomenon of many-body localization. This is characterized by the breakdown of\nthermalization and by information preservation of initial preparations at long\ntimes. To realize this, we use quasi-periodic long-range interactions, which\nare now achievable in high-finesse cavity experiments, to find evidence\nsuggestive of a divergent time-scale in which charge inhomogeneities in the\ninitial state survive asymptotically. This is reminiscent of a glassy behavior,\nwhich appears in the ground-state of this system, being also present at\ninfinite temperatures.\n", "  Measurements of cosmic microwave background spectral distortions have\nprofound implications for our understanding of physical processes taking place\nover a vast window in cosmological history. Foreground contamination is\nunavoidable in such measurements and detailed signal-foreground separation will\nbe necessary to extract cosmological science. We present MCMC-based spectral\ndistortion detection forecasts in the presence of Galactic and extragalactic\nforegrounds for a range of possible experimental configurations, focusing on\nthe Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) as a fiducial concept. We consider\nmodifications to the baseline PIXIE mission (operating 12 months in distortion\nmode), searching for optimal configurations using a Fisher approach. Using only\nspectral information, we forecast an extended PIXIE mission to detect the\nexpected average non-relativistic and relativistic thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich\ndistortions at high significance (194$\\sigma$ and 11$\\sigma$, respectively),\neven in the presence of foregrounds. The $\\Lambda$CDM Silk damping $\\mu$-type\ndistortion is not detected without additional modifications of the instrument\nor external data. Galactic synchrotron radiation is the most problematic source\nof contamination in this respect, an issue that could be mitigated by combining\nPIXIE data with future ground-based observations at low frequencies ($\\nu <\n15-30$GHz). Assuming moderate external information on the synchrotron spectrum,\nwe project an upper limit of $|\\mu| < 3.6\\times 10^{-7}$ (95\\% c.l.), slightly\nmore than one order of magnitude above the fiducial $\\Lambda$CDM signal from\nthe damping of small-scale primordial fluctuations, but a factor of $\\simeq\n250$ improvement over the current upper limit from COBE/FIRAS. This limit could\nbe further reduced to $|\\mu| < 9.4\\times 10^{-8}$ (95\\% c.l.) with more\noptimistic assumptions about low-frequency information. (Abridged)\n", "  Starting from the relativistic form of the Bonn potential as a bare\nnucleon-nucleon interaction, the full Relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock\n(RBHF) equations are solved for finite nuclei in a fully self-consistent basis.\nThis provides a relativistic ab initio calculation of the ground state\nproperties of finite nuclei without any free parameters and without three-body\nforces. The convergence properties for the solutions of these coupled equations\nare discussed in detail at the example of the nucleus $^{16}$O. The binding\nenergies, radii, and spin-orbit splittings of the doubly magic nuclei $^{4}$He,\n$^{16}$O, and $^{40}$Ca are calculated and compared with the earlier RBHF\ncalculated results in a fixed Dirac Woods-Saxon basis and other\nnon-relativistic ab initio calculated results based on pure two-body forces.\n", "  We study the Quantum Focussing Conjecture (QFC) in curved spacetime. Noting\nthat quantum corrections from integrating out massive fields generally induce a\nGauss-Bonnet term, we study Einstein-Hilbert-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and show for\n$d\\ge 5$ spacetime dimensions that weakly-curved solutions can violate the\nassociated QFC for either sign of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling. The nature of the\nviolation shows that -- so long as the Gauss-Bonnet coupling is non-zero -- it\nwill continue to arise for local effective actions containing arbitrary further\nhigher curvature terms, and when gravity is coupled to generic $d\\ge 5$\ntheories of massive quantum fields. The argument also implies violations of a\nrecently-conjectured form of the generalized covariant entropy bound. The\npossible validity of the QFC and covariant entropy bound in $d\\le 4$ spacetime\ndimensions remains open.\n", "  In 1967, Z. Rieder, J. L. Lebowitz and E. Lieb (RLL) introduced a model of\nheat conduction on a crystal that became a milestone problem of non-equilibrium\nstatistical mechanics. Along with its inability to reproduce Fourier's Law -\nwhich subsequent generalizations have been trying to amend - the RLL model is\nalso characterized by awkward cusps at the ends of the non-equilibrium chain,\nan effect that has endured all these years without a satisfactory answer. In\nthis paper, we first show that such trait stems from the insufficiency of\npinning interactions between the chain and the substrate. Assuming the\npossibility of pinning the chain, the analysis of the temperature profile in\nthe space of parameters reveals that for a proper combination of the border and\nbulk pinning values, the temperature profile may shift twice between the RLL\ncuspidal behavior and the expected monotonic local temperature evolution along\nthe system, as a function of the pinning. At those inversions, the temperature\nprofile along the chain is characterized by perfect plateaux: at the first\nthreshold, the cumulants of the heat flux reach their maxima and the vanishing\nof the two-point velocity correlation function for all sites of the chain so\nthat the system behaves similarly to a \"phonon box\". On the other hand, at the\nsecond change of the temperature profile, we still have the vanishing of the\ntwo-point correlation function but only for the bulk, which explains the\nemergence of the temperature plateau and thwarts the reaching of the maximal\nvalues of the cumulants of the heat flux.\n", "  Complex networks analyses of many physical, biological and social phenomena\nshow remarkable structural regularities, yet, their application in studying\nhuman past interaction remains underdeveloped. Here, we present an innovative\nmethod for identifying community structures in the archaeological record that\nallow for independent evaluation of the copper using societies in the Balkans,\nfrom c. 6200 to c. 3200 BC. We achieve this by exploring modularity of\nnetworked systems of these societies across an estimated 3000 years. We employ\nchemical data of copper-based objects from 79 archaeological sites as the\nindependent variable for detecting most densely interconnected sets of nodes\nwith a modularity maximization method. Our results reveal three dominant\nmodular structures across the entire period, which exhibit strong spatial and\ntemporal significance. We interpret patterns of copper supply among prehistoric\nsocieties as reflective of social relations, which emerge as equally important\nas physical proximity. Although designed on a variable isolated from any\narchaeological and spatiotemporal information, our method provides\narchaeologically and spatiotemporally meaningful results. It produces models of\nhuman interaction and cooperation that can be evaluated independently of\nestablished archaeological systematics, and can find wide application on any\nquantitative data from archaeological and historical record.\n", "  The method based on fast Fourier transforms proposed by G. Rom\\'an-P\\'erez\nand J. M. Soler [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 096102 (2009)], which allows for a\ncomputationally fast implementation of the nonlocal van der Waals (vdW)\nfunctionals, has significantly contributed to making the vdW functionals\npopular in solid-state physics. However, the Rom\\'an-P\\'erez-Soler method\nrelies on a plane-wave expansion of the electron density; therefore it can not\nbe applied readily to all-electron densities for which an unaffordable number\nof plane waves would be required for an accurate expansion. In this work, we\npresent the results for the lattice constant and binding energy of solids that\nwere obtained by applying a smoothing procedure to the all-electron density\ncalculated with the linearized augmented plane-wave method. The smoothing\nprocedure has the advantages of being very simple to implement, basis-set\nindependent, and allowing the calculation of the potential. It is also shown\nthat the results agree very well with those from the literature that were\nobtained with the projector augmented wave method.\n", "  We propose Graphene Klein tunnel transistors (GKTFET) as a way to enforce\ncurrent saturation while maintaining large mobility for high speed radio\nfrequency (RF) applications. The GKTFET consists of a sequence of angled\ngraphene p-n junctions (GPNJs). Klein tunneling creates a collimation of\nelectrons across each GPNJ, so that the lack of substantial overlap between\ntransmission lobes across successive junctions creates a gate-tunable transport\ngap without significantly compromising the on-current. Electron scattering at\nthe device edge tends to bleed parasitic states into the gap, but the resulting\npseudogap is still sufficient to create a saturated output ($I_D-V_D$)\ncharacteristic and a high output resistance. The modulated density of states\ngenerates a higher transconductance ($g_m$) and unity current gain cut-off\nfrequency ($f_T$) than GFETs. More significantly the high output resistance\nmakes the unity power gain cut-off frequency ($f_{max}$) of GKTFETs\nconsiderably larger than GFETs, making analog GKTFET potentially useful for RF\nelectronics. Our estimation shows the $f_T$/$f_{max}$ of a GKTFET with 1 $\\mu$m\nchannel reaches 33 GHz/17 GHz, and scale up to 350 GHz/53 GHz for 100 nm\nchannel (assuming a single, scalable trapezoidal gate). The $f_{max}$ of a\nGKTFET is 10 times higher than a GFET with the same channel length.\n", "  We review our results for the dynamics of isolated many-body quantum systems\ndescribed by one-dimensional spin-1/2 models. We explain how the evolution of\nthese systems depends on the initial state and the strength of the perturbation\nthat takes them out of equilibrium; on the Hamiltonian, whether it is\nintegrable or chaotic; and on the onset of multifractal eigenstates that occurs\nin the vicinity of the transition to a many-body localized phase. We unveil\ndifferent behaviors at different time scales. We also discuss how information\nabout the spectrum of a many-body quantum system can be extracted by the sole\nanalysis of its time evolution, giving particular attention to the so-called\ncorrelation hole. This approach is useful for experiments that routinely study\ndynamics, but have limited or no direct access to spectroscopy, as experiments\nwith cold atoms and trapped ions.\n", "  We propose an efficient method to compute the vacuum polarization energy of\nstatic field configurations that do not allow a decomposition into symmetric\nand anti-symmetric channels in one space dimension. In particular we compute\nthe vacuum polarization energy of the kink soliton in the $\\phi^6$ model. We\nlink the dependence of this energy on the position of the center of the soliton\nto the different masses of the quantum fluctuations at negative and positive\nspatial infinity.\n", "  We demonstrate the compression of electron pulses in a high-brightness\nultrafast electron diffraction (UED) instrument using phase-locked microwave\nsignals directly generated from a mode-locked femtosecond oscillator.\nAdditionally, a continuous-wave phase stabilization system that accurately\ncorrects for phase fluctuations arising in the compression cavity from both\npower amplification and thermal drift induced detuning was designed and\nimplemented. An improvement in the microwave timing stability from 100 fs to 5\nfs RMS is measured electronically and the long-term arrival time stability\n($>$10 hours) of the electron pulses improves to below our measurement\nresolution of 50 fs. These results demonstrate sub-relativistic ultrafast\nelectron diffraction with compressed pulses that is no longer limited by\nlaser-microwave synchronization.\n", "  We report the mechanically induced formation of a silicon-hydrogen covalent\nbond and its application in engineering nanoelectronic devices. We show that\nusing the tip of a non-contact atomic force microscope (NC-AFM), a single\nhydrogen atom could be vertically manipulated. When applying a localized\nelectronic excitation, a single hydrogen atom is desorbed from the hydrogen\npassivated surface and can be transferred to the tip apex as evidenced from a\nunique signature in frequency shift curves. In the absence of tunnel electrons\nand electric field in the scanning probe microscope junction at 0 V, the\nhydrogen atom at the tip apex is brought very close to a silicon dangling bond,\ninducing the mechanical formation of a silicon-hydrogen covalent bond and the\npassivation of the dangling bond. The functionalized tip was used to\ncharacterize silicon dangling bonds on the hydrogen-silicon surface, was shown\nto enhance the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) contrast, and allowed NC-AFM\nimaging with atomic and chemical bond contrasts. Through examples, we show the\nimportance of this atomic scale mechanical manipulation technique in the\nengineering of the emerging technology of on-surface dangling bond based\nnanoelectronic devices.\n", "  New insights into phase separation in colloidal suspensions are provided via\na new dynamical theory based on the Polydisperse Lattice-Gas model. The model\ngives a simplified description of polydisperse colloids, incorporating a\nhard-core repulsion combined with polydispersity in the strength of the\nattraction between neighbouring particles. Our mean-field equations describe\nthe local concentration evolution for each of an arbitrary number of species,\nand for an arbitrary overall composition of the system. We focus on the\npredictions for the dynamics of colloidal gas-liquid phase separation after a\nquench into the coexistence region. The critical point and the relevant\nspinodal curves are determined analytically, with the latter depending only on\nthree moments of the overall composition. The results for the early-time\nspinodal dynamics show qualitative changes as one crosses a 'quenched' spinodal\nthat excludes fractionation and so allows only density fluctuations at fixed\ncomposition. This effect occurs for dense systems, in agreement with a\nconjecture by Warren that, at high density, fractionation should be generically\nslow because it requires inter-diffusion of particles. We verify this\nconclusion by showing that the observed qualitative changes disappear when\ndirect particle-particle swaps are allowed in the dynamics. Finally, the rich\nbehaviour beyond the spinodal regime is examined, where we find that the\nevaporation of gas bubbles with strongly fractionated interfaces causes\nlong-lived composition heterogeneities in the liquid phase; we introduce a\ntwo-dimensional density histogram method that allows such effects to be easily\nvisualized for an arbitrary number of particle species.\n", "  NuSTAR is a highly sensitive focusing hard X-ray (HXR) telescope and has\nobserved several small microflares in its initial solar pointings. In this\npaper, we present the first joint observation of a microflare with NuSTAR and\nHinode/XRT on 2015 April 29 at ~11:29 UT. This microflare shows heating of\nmaterial to several million Kelvin, observed in Soft X-rays (SXRs) with\nHinode/XRT, and was faintly visible in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) with SDO/AIA.\nFor three of the four NuSTAR observations of this region (pre-, decay, and post\nphases) the spectrum is well fitted by a single thermal model of 3.2-3.5 MK,\nbut the spectrum during the impulsive phase shows additional emission up to 10\nMK, emission equivalent to A0.1 GOES class. We recover the differential\nemission measure (DEM) using SDO/AIA, Hinode/XRT, and NuSTAR, giving\nunprecedented coverage in temperature. We find the pre-flare DEM peaks at ~3 MK\nand falls off sharply by 5 MK; but during the microflare's impulsive phase the\nemission above 3 MK is brighter and extends to 10 MK, giving a heating rate of\nabout $2.5 \\times 10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$. As the NuSTAR spectrum is purely\nthermal we determined upper-limits on the possible non-thermal bremsstrahlung\nemission. We find that for the accelerated electrons to be the source of the\nheating requires a power-law spectrum of $\\delta \\ge 7$ with a low energy\ncut-off $E_{c} \\lesssim 7$ keV. In summary, this first NuSTAR microflare\nstrongly resembles much more powerful flares.\n", "  From a systematic analysis of the energy-dependence of four\nantibaryon-to-baryon ratios relative to the antikaon-to-kaon ratio, we propose\nan alternative approach determining the strange-quark chemical potential\n($\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}}$). It is found that $\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}}$ generically genuinely\nequals one-fifth the baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{b}}$). An\nadditional quantity depending on $\\mu_{\\mathrm{b}}$ and the freezeout\ntemperature ($T$) should be added in order to assure averaged strangeness\nconversation. This quantity gives a genuine estimation for the possible\nstrangeness enhancement with the increase in the collision energy. At the\nchemical freezeout conditioned to constant entropy density normalized to\ntemperature cubed, various particle ratios calculated at $T$ and\n$\\mu_{\\mathrm{b}}$ and the resultant $\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}}$ excellently agree with\nthe statistical-thermal calculations.\n", "  In this paper, we identified the magnetic source locations of 142 quasi-\nhomologous (QH) coronal mass ejections (CMEs), of which 121 are from solar\ncycle (SC) 23 and 21 from SC 24. Among those CMEs, 63% originated from the same\nsource location as their predecessor (defined as S-type), while 37% origi-\nnated from a different location within the same active region as their\npredecessor (defined as D-type). Their distinctly different waiting time\ndistribution, peaking around 7.5 and 1.5 hours for S- and D-type CMEs, suggests\nthat they might involve different physical mechanisms with different\ncharacteristic time scales. Through detailed analysis based on non-linear force\nfree (NLFF) coronal mag- netic field modeling of two exemplary cases, we\npropose that the S-type QH CMES might involve a recurring energy release\nprocess from the same source location (by magnetic free energy replenishment),\nwhereas the D-type QH CMEs can happen when a flux tube system disturbed by a\nnearby CME.\n", "  We discuss the dynamics of sympathetic cooling of atomic mixtures in\nrealistic, nonlinear trapping potentials using a microscopic effective model\ndeveloped earlier for harmonic traps. We contrast the effectiveness of\ndifferent atomic traps, such as Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic traps and optical\ndipole traps, and the role their intrinsic nonlinearity plays in speeding up or\nslowing down thermalization between the two atomic species. This discussion\nincludes cases of configurations with lower effective dimensionality. From a\nmore theoretical standpoint, our results provide the first exploration of a\ngeneralized Caldeira-Leggett model with nonlinearities both in the trapping\npotential as well as in the interspecies interactions, and no limitations on\ntheir coupling strength.\n", "  Cell phone technology generates massive amounts of data. Although this data\nhas been gathered for billing and logging purposes, today it has a much higher\nvalue, because its volume makes it very useful for big data analyses. In this\nproject, we analyze the viability of using cell phone records to lower the cost\nof urban and transportation planning, in particular, to find out how people\ntravel in a specific city (in this case, Buenos Aires, in Argentina). We use\nanonymized cell phone data to estimate the distribution of the population in\nthe city using different periods of time. We compare those results with\ntraditional methods (urban polling) using data from Buenos Aires\norigin-destination surveys. Traditional polling methods have a much smaller\nsample, in the order of tens of thousands (or even less for smaller cities), to\nmaintain reasonable costs. Furthermore, these studies are performed at most\nonce per decade, in the best cases, in Argentina and many other countries. Our\nobjective is to prove that new methods based on cell phone data are reliable,\nand can be used indirectly to keep a real-time track of the flow of people\namong different parts of a city. We also go further to explore new\npossibilities opened by these methods.\n", "  A differential measurement scheme is proposed which allows for a clear\nobservation of the giant thermal effect for the Casimir force, that was\nrecently predicted to occur in graphene systems at short separation distances.\nThe difference among the Casimir forces acting between a metal-coated sphere\nand the two halves of a dielectric plate, one uncoated and the other coated\nwith graphene, is calculated in the framework of the Dirac model using the\nrigorous formalism of the polarization tensor. It is shown that in the proposed\nconfiguration both the difference among the Casimir forces and its thermal\ncontributioncan be easily measured using already existing experimental setups.\nAn observation of the giant thermal effect should open opportunities for\nmodulation and control of dispersion forces in micromechanical systems based on\ngraphene and other novel 2D-materials.\n", "  We forecast the prospective constraints on the ionized gas model $f_{\\rm\ngas}(z)$ at different evolutionary epochs via the tomographic cross-correlation\nbetween kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect and the reconstructed momentum\nfield at different redshifts. The experiments we consider are the Planck and\nCMB Stage-4 survey for CMB and the SDSS-III for the galaxy spectroscopic\nsurvey. We calculate the tomographic cross-correlation power spectrum, and use\nthe Fisher matrix to forecast the detectability of different $f_{\\rm gas}(z)$\nmodels. We find that for constant $f_{\\rm gas}$ model, Planck can constrain the\nerror of $f_{\\rm gas}$ ($\\sigma_{f_{\\rm gas}}$) at each redshift bin to $\\sim\n0.2$, whereas four cases of CMB-S4 can achieve $\\sigma_{f_{\\rm gas}} \\sim\n10^{-3}$. For $f_{\\rm gas}(z)=f_{\\rm gas,0}/(1+z)$ model the error budget will\nbe slightly broadened. We also investigate the model $f_{\\rm gas}(z)=f_{\\rm\ngas,0}/(1+z)^{\\alpha}$. Planck is unable to constrain the index of redshift\nevolution, but the CMB-S4 experiments can constrain the index $\\alpha$ to the\nlevel of $\\sigma_{\\alpha} \\sim 0.01$--$0.1$. The tomographic cross-correlation\nmethod will provide an accurate measurement of the ionized gas evolution at\ndifferent epochs of the Universe.\n", "  We present a magnetic field confining coil with a sub-$10^{-3}$ field\nuniformity over a large fraction of the coil. The structure is entirely made\nout of printed circuit boards (PCBs). The PCB design allows to tailor the path\nof wires to fit the required geometry. We measure the field uniformity with\ncesium magnetometers in a field range from 1 to 10 $\\mu\\mathrm{T}$. Our\napplication uses such a coil for an atomic magnetometry-based current\ncontroller.\n", "  For $N$ hard-core bosons on an arbitrary lattice with $d$ sites and\nindependent of additional interaction terms we prove that the hard-core\nconstraint itself already enforces a universal upper bound on the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate given by $N_{max}=(N/d)(d-N+1)$. This bound can only be attained for\none-particle states $|\\varphi\\rangle$ with equal amplitudes with respect to the\nhard-core basis (sites) and when the corresponding $N$-particle state\n$|\\Psi\\rangle$ is maximally delocalized. This result is generalized to the\nmaximum condensate possible within a given sublattice. We observe that such\nmaximal local condensation is only possible if the mode entanglement between\nthe sublattice and its complement is minimal. We also show that the maximizing\nstate $|\\Psi\\rangle$ is related to the ground state of a bosonic `Hubbard star'\nshowing Bose-Einstein condensation.\n", "  This work has been presented by RJCV to obtain his PhD degree at Fluminense\nFederal University, in March of 2017. We focused on the synthesis of compounds\nand then on their magneto-strucutral characterization; mainly due to the\ninterplay of these physical properties. We have prepared intermetallic alloys\n(including Heusler alloys) and perovskite oxides (manganites and cobaltites);\nin bulk and nanoparticles. A thorough analysis of the influence of the\nmorphology and crystal structure on the magnetic properties of these compounds\nis addressed.\n", "  Time has a fundamentally different character in quantum mechanics and in\ngeneral relativity. In quantum theory events unfold in a fixed time order while\nin general relativity temporal order is influenced by the distribution of\nmatter. When the distribution of matter requires a quantum description,\ntemporal order is expected to become non-classical -- a scenario beyond the\nscope of current theories. Here we provide a direct description of such a\nscenario. We consider a massive body in a spatial superposition and show how it\nleads to \"entanglement\" of temporal orders between time-like events in the\nresulting space-time. This entanglement enables accomplishing a task, violation\nof a Bell inequality, that is impossible under classical temporal order.\nViolation of the inequality means that temporal order becomes non-classical --\nit cannot be described by locally defined classical variables. Our approach\nprovides a quantitative method for investigating quantum aspects of space-time\nand gravity.\n", "  We estimate differential rapidity cross sections for $\\Psi$ and $\\Upsilon$\nproduction via p-Pb collisions at 8 TeV. We use the mixed heavy quark hybrid\ntheory in which the $J/\\Psi(1S),\\Upsilon(1S),\\Upsilon(2S)$ are standard mesons\nwhile the $\\Psi(2S)$ and $\\Upsilon(3S)$ are mixed hybrids, approximately 50%\nstandard $|q \\bar{q}>$ states and 50% hybrid $|q \\bar{q} g>$ states. This is an\nextension of previous work on heavy-quark state production via A-A collisions\nat RHIC.\n", "  Sean Carroll has recently argued that theories predicting that observations\nare dominated by Boltzmann Brains should be rejected because they are\ncognitively unstable: \"they cannot simultaneously be true and justifiably\nbelieved.\" While such Boltzmann Brain theories are indeed cognitively unstable,\none does not need to appeal to this argumentation to reject them. Instead, they\nmay be ruled out by conventional Bayesian reasoning, which is sufficient to\nkeep Boltzmann Brains at bay.\n", "  We propose a proof-of-principle experiment to encode one logical qubit in\nnoise protected subspace of three identical spins in a methyl group. The\nsymmetry analysis of the wavefunction shows that this fermionic system exhibits\na symmetry correlation between the spatial degree of freedom and the spin\ndegree of freedom. We show that one can use this correlation to populate the\nnoiseless subsystem by relying on the interaction between the electric dipole\nmoment of the methyl group with a circularly polarized microwave field. Logical\ngates are implemented by controlling both the intensity and phase of the\napplied field.\n", "  The properties of bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) are known to vary in\nterms of their parameters. In this work, an experimental approach, including\npattern recognition concepts and methods such as principal component analysis\n(PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), was used to experimentally\ninvestigate the variation among BJTs belonging to integrated circuits known as\ntransistor arrays. It was shown that a good deal of the devices variance can be\ncaptured using only two PCA axes. It was also verified that, though\nsubstantially small variation of parameters is observed for BJT from the same\narray, larger variation arises between BJTs from distinct arrays, suggesting\nthe consideration of device characteristics in more critical analog designs. As\na consequence of its supervised nature, LDA was able to provide a substantial\nseparation of the BJT into clusters, corresponding to each transistor array. In\naddition, the LDA mapping into two dimensions revealed a clear relationship\nbetween the considered measurements. Interestingly, a specific mapping\nsuggested by the PCA, involving the total harmonic distortion variation\nexpressed in terms of the average voltage gain, yielded an even better\nseparation between the transistor array clusters.\n", "  We report the experimental generation of a class of spin-orbit vector modes\nof light via an asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer, obtained from an input\nbeam prepared in a product state of its spin and orbital degrees of freedom.\nThese modes contain a spatially varying polarization structure which may be\ncontrollably propagated about the beam axis by varying the retardance between\nthe vertical and horizontal polarization components of the light. Additionally,\ntheir transverse spatial intensity distributions may be continuously\nmanipulated by tuning the input polarization parameters. In the case of an\nanalogous biphoton input, we predict that this device will exhibit biphoton\n(Hong-Ou-Mandel) interference in conjunction with the aforementioned tunable\nmode transformations.\n", "  Dielectric screening is greatly important to an accurate calculation of the\nexciton binding energies in two-dimensional materials. In this work, we\ncalculate the dielectric function and 2D polarizability of multilayer (up to\nthree) phosphorene sheets using Density Functional Theory. The 2D\npolarizabilities are then used in the dielectric screening of the excitonic\ninteraction in multilayer phosphorene quantum dots. In the limit of large\nquantum dots, excitonic gaps are shown to exhibit very good agreement with\nstate-of-the-art measurements of the optical gaps of multilayer phosphorene\nsheets deposited in different substrates.\n", "  When modeling vehicular traffic flow on highway networks via macroscopic\nmodels, suitable coupling conditions at the network nodes are crucial.\nFrequently, the evolution of traffic flow on each network edge is described in\na lane-averaged fashion using a single-class Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model.\nAt off-ramps, split ratios (i.e., what percentage of traffic exits the highway)\nare prescribed that can be drawn from historic data. In this situation,\nclassical FIFO coupling conditions yield unrealistic results, in that a clogged\noff-ramp yields zero flux through the node. As a remedy, non-FIFO conditions\nhave been proposed. However, as we demonstrate here, those lead to spurious\nre-routing of vehicles. Then, a new coupling model, FIFOQ, is presented that\npreserves the desirable properties of non-FIFO models, while not leading to any\nspurious re-routing.\n", "  We discuss the occurrence of subcritical star formation in the outskirts of\nsome galactic discs and across LSB galaxies, contrary to the picture that star\nformation happens only when the gas surface density is above a critical\nthreshold density. This raises the question of whether the Toomre Q-criterion\nfor gas alone is valid for correlating the gas distribution to star formation\nor rather some effective Q-parameter, taking account of components such as\nstars, dark matter and magnetic fields, is more representative of the\ncorrelation between gas instability and star formation activity. As a potential\ncandidate, we investigate the role of dark matter in triggering subcritical\nstar formation, particularly at the outskirts where dark matter is dominant.\nIndeed, our axisymmetric analysis favours the picture that dark matter\ncontributes to disc instability at the subcritical regime where gas seems\nstable when dark matter is neglected.\n", "  We present an analysis of the entangling quantum kicked top focusing on the\nfew qubit case and the initial condition dependence of the time-averaged\nentanglement $S_Q$ for spin-coherent states. We show a very strong connection\nbetween the classical phase space and the initial condition dependence of $S_Q$\neven for the extreme case of two spin-$1/2$ qubits. This correlation is not\nrelated directly to chaos in the classical dynamics. We introduce a measure of\nthe behavior of a classical trajectory which correlates far better with the\nentanglement and show that the maps of classical and quantum initial-condition\ndependence are both organized around the symmetry points of the Hamiltonian. We\nalso show clear (quasi-)periodicity in entanglement as a function of number of\nkicks and of kick strength.\n", "  The low energy behaviour of Quantum Chromodynamics makes unreliable an\nexpansion in terms of its coupling strength, since nothing guarantees the\nconvergence of such expansion. To overcomer such difficulty one resorts to\nLattice QCD or Effective Field Theories. In this thesis we compute hadronic\nprocesses at low energies, using Resonance Chiral Lagrangians as the effective\ntheory of QCD. The processes we study are important background on the search\nfor Lepton Flavor Violation, Lepton Universality Violation, Lepton Number\nViolation, Second Class Currents and study the Hadronic light-by-light\ncontribution to the Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the muon. All such processes\nare of great interest since all of them are to be studied with an increased\nprecision in the very near future by different experiments.\n", "  In this paper, the first complete photometric light curves in the B, V, and R\npassbands for an eclipsing binary LO Com are presented, and the photometric\nsolution for the LO Com is derived by analyzing these light curves by using the\nWilson and Devinney code. From the photometric solution, it is found that the\nLO Com is a W-type W UMa binary with a mass ratio of q={m}2/{m}1=2.478 and a\ncontact degree of f=(3.2+/- 0.25) % . By combining the two new minimum times\nwith those published earlier in the literature, we have found that the (O - C)\ncurve shows a downward parabolic variation corresponding to a long-term\ndecrease in the orbital period with a rate of {d}P/{d}t=-1.18*{10}-7 days yr-1.\nThis long-term decrease in its orbital period may be caused by mass transfer\nfrom the more massive component to the less massive one.\n", "  The glassy state is known to undergo slow structural relaxation, where the\nsystem progressively explores lower free-energy minima which are either\namorphous (ageing) or crystalline (devitrification). Recently, there is growing\ninterest in the unusual intermittent collective displacements of a large number\nof particles known as \"avalanches\". However, their structural origin and\ndynamics are yet to be fully addressed. Here, we study hard-sphere glasses\nwhich either crystallise or age depending on the degree of size polydispersity,\nand show that a small number of particles are thermodynamically driven to\nrearrange in regions of low density and bond orientational order. This causes a\ntransient loss of mechanical equilibrium which facilitates a large cascade of\nmotion. Combined with previously identified phenomenology, we have a complete\nkinetic pathway for structural change which is common to both ageing and\ncrystallisation. Furthermore, this suggests that transient force balance is\nwhat distinguishes glasses from supercooled liquids.\n", "  Solar system small bodies come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, which\nare achieved following very individual evolutional paths through billions of\nyears. This paper focuses on the reshaping process of rubble-pile asteroids\ndriven by meteorite impacts. In our study, numerous possible equilibrium\nconfigurations are obtained via Monte Carlo simulation, and the structural\nstability of these configurations is determined via eigen analysis of the\ngeometric constructions. The eigen decomposition reveals a connection between\nthe cluster's reactions and the types of external disturbance. Numerical\nsimulations are performed to verify the analytical results. The gravitational\nN-body code pkdgrav is used to mimic the responses of the cluster under\nintermittent non-dispersive impacts. We statistically confirm that the\nstability index, the total gravitational potential and the volume of inertia\nellipsoid show consistent tendency of variation. A common regime is found in\nwhich the clusters tend towards crystallization under intermittent impacts,\ni.e., only the configurations with high structural stability survive under the\nexternal disturbances. The results suggest the trivial non-disruptive impacts\nmight play an important role in the rearrangement of the constituent blocks,\nwhich may strengthen these rubble piles and help to build a robust structure\nunder impacts of similar magnitude. The final part of this study consists of\nsystematic simulations over two parameters, the projectile momentum and the\nrotational speed of the cluster. The results show a critical value exists for\nthe projectile momentum, as predicted by theory, below which all clusters\nbecome responseless to external disturbances; and the rotation proves to be\nsignificant for it exhibits an \"enhancing\" effect on loose-packed clusters,\nwhich coincides with the observation that several fast-spinning asteroids have\nlow bulk densities.\n", "  The magnetic response related to paramagnetic Meissner effect (PME) is\nstudied in a high quality single crystal ZrB12 with non-monotonic vortex-vortex\ninteractions. We observe the expulsion and penetration of magnetic flux in the\nform of vortex clusters with increasing temperature. A vortex phase diagram is\nconstructed which shows that the PME can be explained by considering the\ninterplay among the flux compression, the different temperature dependencies of\nthe vortex-vortex and the vortex-pin interactions, and thermal fluctuations.\nSuch a scenario is in good agreement with the results of the magnetic\nrelaxation measurements.\n", "  We report on results concerning a partially aggregated Stock Flow Consistent\n(SFC) macroeconomic model in the stationary state where the sectors of banks\nand firms are aggregated, the sector of households is dis-aggregated, and the\nprobability density function (pdf) of the wealth of households is exogenous,\nconstrained by econometric data. It is shown that the equality part of the\nconstraint can be reduced to a single constant-sum equation, which relates this\nproblem to the study of continuous mass transport problems, and to the sum of\niid random variables. Existing results can thus be applied, and provide\nmarginal probabilities, and the location of the critical point before\ncondensation occurs. Various numerical experiments are performed using Monte\nCarlo sampling of the hit-and-run type, using wealth and income data for\nFrance.\n", "  Recently, a measurement of the vector-boson scattering process with same-sign\nW bosons has been reported by the CMS collaboration. Hence it is of prime\nimportance to have precise predictions with next-to-leading order (NLO)\naccuracy. In these proceedings, we report on a recent NLO electroweak\ncomputation to the full process ${\\rm p}{\\rm p}\\to\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu{\\rm e}^+\\nu_{\\rm\ne}{\\rm j}{\\rm j}$. As realistic experimental event selections are applied to\nthe final state, it can directly be compared with experimental measurements.\nThis is particularly important as the corrections turn out to be surprisingly\nlarge and even exceed the NLO QCD corrections. The NLO electroweak predictions\nare presented at the cross-section and differential distribution level.\n", "  The structure, composition and electrophysical characteristics of\nlow-temperature silicon dioxide films under influence of various technology\nfactors, such as ion implantation, laser irradiation, thermal and photonic\nannealing, have been studied. Silicon dioxide films have been obtained by\nmonosilane oxidation using plasma chemical method, reactive cathode sputtering,\nand tetraethoxysilane pyrolysis. In the capacity of substrates, germanium,\nsilicon, gallium arsenide and gallium nitride were used. Structure and\ncomposition of the dielectric films were analyzed by methods of infrared\ntransmission spectroscopy and frustrated internal reflectance spectroscopy.\nAnalysis of modification efficiency of low-temperature silicon dioxide films\nhas been made depending on the substrate type, structure and properties of the\nfilms, their moisture permeability, dielectric deposition technique, type and\ndose of implantation ions, temperature and kind of annealing.\n", "  Because final properties of nanoscale polymeric structures are largely\ndetermined by the solid-state microstructure of the confined polymer, it is\nimperative not only to understand how the microstructure of polymers develops\nunder nanoscale confinement but also to establish means to manipulate it. Here\nwe present a series of processing strategies, adapted from methods used in bulk\npolymer processing, that allow to control the solidification of polymer\nnanostructures. Firstly, we show that supramolecular nucleating agents can be\nreadily used to modify the crystallization kinetics of confined poly(vinylidene\nfluoride) (PVDF). In addition, we demonstrate that microstructural features\nthat are not traditionally affected by nucleating agents, such as the\norientation of crystals, can be tuned with the crystallization temperature\napplied. Interestingly, we also show that high crystallization temperatures and\nlong annealing periods induce the formation of the modification of PVDF, hence\nenabling the simple production of ferro/piezoelectric nanostructures. We\nanticipate that the approaches presented here can open up a plethora of new\npossibilities for the processing of polymer-based nanostructures with tailored\nproperties and functionalities.\n", "  This paper proposes that common measures for network transitivity, based on\nthe enumeration of transitive triples, do not reflect the theoretical\nstatements about transitivity they aim to describe. These statements are often\nformulated as comparative conditional probabilities, but these are not directly\nreflected by simple functions of enumerations. We think that a better approach\nis obtained by considering the linear regression coefficient of ties\n$i\\,\\rightarrow\\,j$ on the number of two-paths\n$i\\,\\rightarrow\\,k\\rightarrow\\,j$ for the $(n-2)$ possible intermediate nodes\n$k$. Two measures of transitivity based on correlation coefficients between the\nexistence of a tie and the existence, or the number, of two-paths are\ndeveloped, and called \"Transitivity Phi\" and \"Transitivity Correlation\". Some\ndesirable properties for these measures are studied and compared to existing\nclustering coefficients, in both random (Erd\\\"os-Renyi) and in stylized\nnetworks (windmills). Furthermore, it is shown that under the condition of zero\nTransitivity Correlation, the total number of transitive triples is determined\nby four underlying features of any directed graph: size, density, reciprocity,\nand the covariance between indegrees and outdegrees. Also, it is demonstrated\nthat plotting conditional probability of ties, given the number of two-paths,\nprovides valuable insights into empirical regularities and irregularities of\ntransitivity patterns.\n", "  Assigning boundary conditions, such as acoustic impedance, to the frequency\ndomain thermoviscous wave equations (TWE), derived from the linearized\nNavier-Stokes equations (LNSE) poses a Helmholtz problem, solution to which\nyields a discrete set of complex eigenfunctions and eigenvalue pairs. The\nproposed method -- the inverse Helmholtz solver (iHS) -- reverses such\nprocedure by returning the value of acoustic impedance at one or more unknown\nimpedance boundaries (IBs) of a given domain, via spatial integration of the\nTWE for a given real-valued frequency with assigned conditions on other\nboundaries. The iHS procedure is applied to a second-order spatial\ndiscretization of the TWEs on an unstructured staggered grid arrangement. Only\nthe momentum equation is extended to the center of each IB face where pressure\nand velocity components are co-located and treated as unknowns. The iHS is\nfinally closed via assignment of the surface gradient of pressure phase over\nthe IBs, corresponding to assigning the shape of the acoustic waveform at the\nIB. The iHS procedure can be carried out independently for different\nfrequencies, making it embarrassingly parallel, and able to return the complete\nbroadband complex impedance distribution at the IBs in any desired frequency\nrange to arbitrary numerical precision. The iHS approach is first validated\nagainst Rott's theory for viscous rectangular and circular ducts. The impedance\nof a toy porous cavity with a complex geometry is then reconstructed and\nvalidated with companion fully compressible unstructured Navier-Stokes\nsimulations resolving the cavity geometry. Verification against one-dimensional\nimpedance test tube calculations based on time-domain impedance boundary\nconditions (TDIBC) is also carried out. Finally, results from a preliminary\nanalysis of a thermoacoustically unstable cavity are presented.\n", "  The measurement of shear stress acting on a biologically relevant surface is\na challenging problem, particularly in the complex environment of, for example,\nthe vasculature. While an experimental method for the direct detection of wall\nshear stress via the imaging of a synthetic biology nanorod has recently been\ndeveloped, the data interpretation so far has been limited to phenomenological\nrandom walk modelling, small angle approximation, and image analysis techniques\nwhich do not take into account the production of an image from a 3D subject. In\nthis report we develop a mathematical and statistical framework to estimate\nshear stress from rapid imaging sequences based firstly on stochastic modelling\nof the dynamics of a tethered Brownian fibre in shear flow, and secondly on\nnovel model-based image analysis, which reconstructs phage positions by solving\nthe inverse problem of image formation. This framework is tested on\nexperimental data, providing the first mechanistically rational analysis of the\nnovel assay. What follows further develops the established theory for an\nuntethered particle in a semi-dilute suspension, which is of relevance to, for\nexample, the study of Brownian nanowires without flow, and presents new ideas\nin the field of multidisciplinary image analysis.\n", "  The Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method is a powerful tool for radiation\nphysicists, and several general-purpose software packages are commonly applied\nin a myriad of different radiation physics fields today. In medical physics,\ncharged particle detectors for proton Computed Tomography are under\ndevelopment, a modality introduced in order to increase the accuracy of proton\nradiation therapy. MC simulations are helpful during the development and\noptimization phase of such detector systems. In order to justify the usage of\nMC for such purposes, the simulation output must be validated against\nexperimental or theoretical data, or even cross-checked between different MC\nsoftware packages. In this study, we compare three general-purpose MC software\npackages (GATE/Geant4, MCNP6 and FLUKA) with respect to how they predict the\nspatial distribution of the stopping position of protons. They are compared to\neach other and to semi-empirical data, using the mean proton range, the\nlongitudinal and lateral variation of individual proton ranges, and the\nfraction of primary protons lost to nuclear interactions. This comparison is\nperformed in two homogeneous materials and in a detector geometry designed for\nproton Computed Tomography. The three MC software packages agree well, and\nsufficiently reproduce the semi-empirical data. Some discrepancies are\nobserved, such as less lateral beam spreading in GATE/Geant4, and a small\ndeficiency in the MCNP6 proton range in water: This is consistent with\npreviously published data. Due to the general agreement, the choice of\nsimulation framework may be made on personal preferences. It is important to\nnote that the choice of physics packages, simulation parameter settings and\nmaterial definitions are important aspects when performing MC simulations, both\nduring the preparation, execution and interpretation of the simulation results.\n", "  This work is concerned with an inverse problem of identifying the current\nsource distribution of the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations from\nmulti-frequency measurements. Motivated by the Fourier method for the scalar\nHelmholtz equation and the polarization vector decomposition, we propose a\nnovel method for determining the source function in the full vector Maxwell's\nsystem. Rigorous mathematical justifications of the method are given and\nnumerical examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and\neffectiveness of the method.\n", "  Straining graphene results in the appearance of a pseudo-magnetic field which\nalters its local electronic properties. Applying a pressure difference between\nthe two sides of the membrane causes it to bend/bulge resulting in a resistance\nchange. We find that the resistance changes linearly with pressure for bubbles\nof small radius while the response becomes non-linear for bubbles that stretch\nalmost to the edges of the sample. This is explained as due to the strong\ninterference of propagating electronic modes inside the bubble. Our\ncalculations show that high gauge factors can be obtained in this way which\nmakes graphene a good candidate for pressure sensing.\n", "  Recently, a new class of supernovae Ia was discovered: the supernovae Iax;\nthe increasing sample of these objects share common features as lower\nmaximum-light velocities and typically lower peak magnitudes. In our scenario,\nthe progenitors of the SNe Iax are very massive white dwarfs, possibly hybrid\nC+O+Ne white dwarfs; due to the accretion from a binary companion, they reach\nthe Chandrasekhar mass and undergo a central carbon deflagration, but the\ndeflagration is quenched when it reaches the outer O +Ne layer. This class of\nSNe Ia are expected to be rarer than standard SNe Ia and do not affect the\nchemical evolution in the solar neighbourhood; however, they have a short delay\ntime and they could influence the evolution of metal-poor systems. Therefore,\nwe have included in a stochastic chemical evolution model for the dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy Ursa minor the contribution of SNe Iax. The model predicts a\nspread in [Mn/Fe] in the ISM medium at low metallicity and - at the same time -\na decrease of the [alpha/Fe] elements, as in the classical time delay model.\nThis is in surprising agreement with the observed abundances in stars of Ursa\nminor and provide a strong indication to the origin of this new classes of\nSNIa.\n", "  The contact angle of a liquid drop on a rigid surface is determined by the\nclassical theory of Young-Laplace. For chemically homogeneous surfaces, this\nangle is a constant.\n  We study the minimal-energy configurations of liquid drops on rough surfaces.\nHere the actual angle is still constant for homogeneous surfaces, but the\napparent angle can fluctuate widely. A limit theorem is introduced for minimal\nenergy configuration, where the rigid surface converges to a smooth one, but\nthe roughness parameter is kept constant. It turns out that the limit of\nminimal energy configurations correspond to liquid drop on a smooth surface\nwith an appropriately defined effective chemical interaction energy. It turns\nout that the effective chemical interaction depends linearly on the roughness\nin a certain range of parameters, corresponding to full wetting. Outside this\nrange the most stable configuration corresponds to a partial wetting and the\neffective interaction energy depends on the geometry in an essential way.\n  This result partially justifies and extends Wenzel and Cassie's laws and can\nbe used to deduce the actual inclination angle in the most stable state, where\nthe apparent one is known by measurement. This, in turn, may be applied to\ndeduce the roughness parameter if the interfacial energy is known, or visa\nversa.\n", "  The universality of the route to chaos is analytically proven for countably\ninfinite number of maps by proposing the Super Generalized Boole (SGB)\ntransformations. As one of the route to chaos, intermittency route was studied\nby Pomeau and Manneville numerically. They conjectured the universality in Type\n1 intermittency, that the critical exponent of the Lyapunov exponent is $1/2$\nin Type 1 intermittency. In order to prove their conjecture, we showed that for\ncertain parameter ranges, the SGB transformations are exact and preserve the\nCauchy distribution. Using the property of exactness, we proved that the\ncritical exponent is $1/2$ for countably infinite number of maps where Type 1\nintermittency occurs.\n", "  In this paper, we show a comparison of different definitions of the\ntopological charge on the lattice. We concentrate on one small-volume ensemble\nwith 2 flavours of dynamical, maximally twisted mass fermions and use three\nmore ensembles to analyze the approach to the continuum limit. We investigate\nseveral fermionic and gluonic definitions. The former include the index of the\noverlap Dirac operator, the spectral flow of the Wilson--Dirac operator and the\nspectral projectors. For the latter, we take into account different\ndiscretizations of the topological charge operator and various smoothing\nschemes to filter out ultraviolet fluctuations: the gradient flow, stout\nsmearing, APE smearing, HYP smearing and cooling. We show that it is possible\nto perturbatively match different smoothing schemes and provide a well-defined\nsmoothing scale. We relate the smoothing parameters for cooling, stout and APE\nsmearing to the gradient flow time $\\tau$. In the case of hypercubic smearing\nthe matching is performed numerically. We investigate which conditions have to\nbe met to obtain a valid definition of the topological charge and\nsusceptibility and we argue that all valid definitions are highly correlated\nand allow good control over topology on the lattice.\n", "  Radio astronomy observatories with high throughput back end instruments\nrequire real-time data processing. While computing hardware continues to\nadvance rapidly, development of real-time processing pipelines remains\ndifficult and time-consuming, which can limit scientific productivity.\nMotivated by this, we have developed Bifrost: an open-source software framework\nfor rapid pipeline development. Bifrost combines a high-level Python interface\nwith highly efficient reconfigurable data transport and a library of computing\nblocks for CPU and GPU processing. The framework is generalizable, but\ninitially it emphasizes the needs of high-throughput radio astronomy pipelines,\nsuch as the ability to process data buffers as if they were continuous streams,\nthe capacity to partition processing into distinct data sequences (e.g.,\nseparate observations), and the ability to extract specific intervals from\nbuffered data. Computing blocks in the library are designed for applications\nsuch as interferometry, pulsar dedispersion and timing, and transient search\npipelines. We describe the design and implementation of the Bifrost framework\nand demonstrate its use as the backbone in the correlation and beamforming back\nend of the Long Wavelength Array station in the Sevilleta National Wildlife\nRefuge, NM.\n", "  In previous papers we introduced the notion of special Bohr - Sommerfeld\nlagrangian cycles on a compact simply connected symplectic manifold with\ninteger symplectic form, and presented the main interesting case: compact\nsimply connected algebraic variety with an ample line bundle such that the\nspace of Bohr - Sommerfeld lagrangian cycles with respect to a compatible\nKahler form of the Hodge type and holomorphic sections of the bundle is finite.\nThe main problem appeared in this way is singular components of the\ncorresponding lagrangian shadows (or sceletons of the corresponding Weinstein\ndomains) which are hard to distinguish or resolve. In the present text we avoid\nthis difficulty presenting the points of the moduli space of special Bohr -\nSommerfeld lagrangian cycles by exact compact lagrangian submanifolds on the\ncomplements $X \\backslash D_{\\alpha}$ modulo Hamiltonian isotopies, where\n$D_{\\alpha}$ is the zero divisor of holomorphic section $\\alpha$. In a sense it\ncorresponds to the usage of gauge classes of hermitian connections instead of\npure holomorphic structures in the theory of the moduli space of (semi) stable\nvector bundles.\n", "  Quantum correlations: entanglement and quantumness of correlations are main\nresource for quantum information theory. In this chapter it is presented the\nscenarios which quantumness of correlations plays an interesting role in\nentanglement distillation protocol. By means of Koashi - Winter relation, it is\ndiscussed that quantumness of correlations are related to the irreversibility\nof the entanglement distillation protocol. The activation protocol is\nintroduced, and it is proved that quantumness of correlations can create\ndistillable entanglement between the system and the measurement apparatus\nduring a local measurement process.\n", "  This article is divided into three parts. First, a systematic derivation of\nthe Hawking radiation is given in three different ways. The information loss\nproblem is then discussed in great detail. The last part contains a concise\ndiscussion of black hole thermodynamics. This article was published as chapter\n$6$ of the IOP book \"Lectures on General Relativity, Cosmology and Quantum\nBlack Holes\" (July $2017$).\n", "  In this work, we study different quantum thermodynamic functions (QTFs) of a\ncold atom subjected to an artificial non-Abelian uniform magnetic field and\nlinearly coupled to a quantum heat bath through either usual\ncoordinate-coordinate coupling or through momentum variables. The bath is\nmodelled as a collection of independent quantum harmonic oscillators. In each\nof the coupling scheme, the effect of the non-Abelian magnetic field on\ndifferent QTFs are explicitly demonstrated for a U(2) gauge transformation. In\neach case, we show that the free energy has a different expression than that\nfor the Abelian case. We consider two illustrative heat bath spectrum (Ohmic\nbath and Drude model) to evaluate explicit closed form expressions of free\nenergy (F), specific heat (C), and entropy (S) in the low temperature limit for\neach of the above mentioned coupling scheme. The dependence of different QTFs\non the non-Abelian magnetic field are pointed out even if the gauge potential\nis uniform in space.\n", "  This article deals with the prediction of thermomechanical properties of\nfiber reinforced composites using several micromechanics models. These include\nstrength of material approach, Halpin-Tsai equations, multi-phase mechanics of\nmaterials approaches, multi-phase Mori-Tanaka models, composite cylindrical\nassemblage model, Voigt-Reuss models, modified mixture rule, Cox model,\neffective medium approach and method of cells. Several composite systems\nreinforced with short and long, aligned, random and wavy reinforcements were\nconsidered. In addition, different aspects such as fiber-matrix interphase,\nfiber-matrix interfacial thermal resistance, fiber geometry, and multiple types\nof reinforcements were considered to model the composites systems. The current\nstudy also presents some important preliminary concepts and application of\ndeveloped micromechanics models to advanced nanocomposites such as carbon\nnanotube reinforced composite. Main contribution of the current work is the\ninvestigation of several analytical micromechanical models, while most of the\nexisting studies on the subject deal with only one or two approaches\nconsidering few aspects.\n", "  In these lecture notes I describe the theory of QCD and its application,\nthrough perturbation theory, at particle colliders.\n", "  These notes represent a summary of three lectures on flavour and CP\nviolation, given at the CERNs European School of High Energy Physics in 2014.\nThey cover flavour physics within the standard model, phenomenology of CP\nviolation in meson mixing and decays, as well as constraints of flavour\nobservableson physics beyond the standard model. In preparing the lectures (and\nconsequently this summary) I drew heavily from several existing excellent and\nexhaustive sets of lecture notes and reviews on flavour physics and CP\nviolation [1]. The reader is encouraged to consult those as well as the\noriginal literature for a more detailed study.\n", "  These lectures are a brief introduction to supersymmetry.\n", "  Physics simulations are widely used to improve the learning process in\nscience and engineering education. Deployment of a computational physics\nsimulation/model is extremely complex given the fact that both knowledge and\nskills for the science equations and the computational and programming aspects\nare required for a fully functional simulation, typically requiring a science\neducator and computer scientists/developer to work together. However, when\nusing Easy JavaScript Simulation (EjsS) modeling toolkit, the instructor can be\nboth the science educator and computer programmer, only needing to define the\nsimulation variables, model and view, and the modeling toolkit can generate the\ncomputer codes for the physics simulation. Moreover, the programming aspects\ncan become even more complex if simulations require being optimized for both\nAndroid and iOS mobile devices. The current version of EjsS provides\ninstructors with an authoring tool that includes facilities for the creation of\nsuch JavaScript simulations as mobile apps, thus simplifying the purely\nprogramming aspects. This paper presents a new and novel EjsS functionality to\ngenerate physics simulation apps for iOS and Android. The generation process is\nbased on the integration of the Ionic/Cordova and AngularJS technologies into\nEjsS. Finally, we present several working examples based on the works of Open\nSource Physics at Singapore.\n", "  We theoretically study the magnetism induced by the proximity effect in the\nnormal metal of ferromagnetic Josephson junction composed of two $s$-wave\nsuperconductors separated by ferromagnetic metal/normal metal/ferromagnetic\nmetal junction (${S}/{F}/{N}/{F}/{S}$ junction). We calculate the magnetization\nin the $N$ by solving the Eilenberger equation. We show that the magnetization\narises in the ${N}$ when the product of anomalous Green's functions of the\nspin-triplet even-frequency odd-parity Cooper pair and spin-singlet\nodd-frequency odd-parity Cooper pair in the ${N}$ has a finite value. The\ninduced magnetization $M(d,\\theta)$ can be decomposed into two parts,\n$M(d,\\theta)=M^{\\rm I}(d)+M^{\\rm II}(d,\\theta)$, where $d$ is the thickness of\n$N$ and $\\theta$ is superconducting phase difference between two ${S}$s.\nTherefore, $\\theta$ dependence of $M(d,\\theta)$ allows us to control the\namplitude of magnetization by changing $\\theta$. The variation of $M(d,\\theta)$\nwith $\\theta$ is indeed the good evidence of the magnetization induced by the\nproximity effect, since some methods of magnetization measurement pick up total\nmagnetization in the ${S}/{F}/{N}/{F}/{S}$ junction.\n", "  The cause of the screening of the weak interactions at long distances puzzled\nthe high-energy community for more nearly half a century. With the discovery of\nthe Higgs boson a new era started with direct experimental information on the\nphysics behind the breaking of the electroweak symmetry. This breaking plays a\nfundamental role in our understanding of particle physics and sits at the\nhigh-energy frontier beyond which we expect new physics that supersedes the\nStandard Model. The Higgs boson (inclusive and differential) production and\ndecay rates offer a new way to probe this frontier.\n", "  The main theme of the lectures covered the experimental work at hadron\ncolliders, with a clear focus on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and on the\nroadmap that led finally to the discovery of the Higgs boson. The lectures were\nnot a systematic course on machine and detector technologies, but rather tried\nto give a physics-motivated overview of many experimental aspects that were all\nrelevant for making the discovery. The actual lectures covered a much broader\nscope than what is documented here in this writeup. The successful concepts for\nthe experiments at the LHC have benefitted from the experience gained with\nprevious generations of detectors at lower-energy machines. The lectures\nincluded also an outlook to the future experimental programme at the LHC, with\nits machine and experiments upgrades, as well as a short discussion of possible\nfacilities at the high energy frontier beyond LHC.\n", "  In these three lectures I review the need to go beyond the Standard Glashow-\nWeinberg-Salam Model and discuss some of the approaches that are explored in\nthis direction.\n", "  The three-dimensional picture of quarks and gluons in the proton is set to be\nrevealed through Deeply virtual Compton scattering while a critically important\npuzzle in the one-dimensional picture remains, namely, the origins of the EMC\neffect. Incoherent nuclear DVCS, i.e. DVCS on a nucleon inside a nucleus, can\nreveal the 3D partonic structure of the bound nucleon and shed a new light on\nthe EMC effect. However, the Fermi motion of the struck nucleon, off-shell\neffects and final-state interactions (FSIs) complicate this parton level\ninterpretation. We propose here a measurement of incoherent DVCS with a tagging\nof the recoiling spectator system (nucleus A-1) to systematically control\nnuclear effects. Through spectator-tagged DVCS, a fully detected final state\npresents a unique opportunity to systematically study these nuclear effects and\ncleanly observe possible modification of the nucleon's quark distributions.\n  We propose to measure the DVCS beam-spin asymmetries (BSAs) on $^4$He and\ndeuterium targets. The reaction $^4$He$(e,e^{\\prime}\\gamma\\,p\\,^3$H$)$ with a\nfully detected final state has the rare ability to simultaneously quantify\nFSIs, measure initial nucleon momentum, and provide a sensitive probe to other\nnuclear effects at the parton level. The DVCS BSA on a (quasi-free) neutron\nwill be measured by tagging a spectator proton with a deuteron target.\nSimilarly, a bound neutron measurement detects a spectator $^3$He off a $^4$He\ntarget. These two observables will allow for a self-contained measurement of\nthe neutron off-forward EMC Effect.\n", "  We investigate the long-period fluctuations in the brightness of the Sun as a\nstar using the measurements of sunlight reflected from the planets (Jupiter,\nMars) when the light hits the field of view of the LASCO C3 coronagraph (Large\nAngle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment).\n", "  In this paper, we study the long-time behaviour of solutions to the\nVlasov-Fokker-Planck equation where the confining potential is non-convex. This\nis a nonlocal nonlinear partial differential equation describing the time\nevolution of the probability distribution of a particle moving under the\ninfluence of a non-convex potential, an interaction potential, a friction force\nand a stochastic force. Using the free-energy approach, we show that under\nsuitable assumptions solutions of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation converge to\nan invariant probability.\n", "  We compute the perturbative expression of Wilson loops up to order $g^4$ for\nSU($N$) lattice gauge theories with Wilson action on a finite box with twisted\nboundary conditions. Our formulas are valid for any dimension and any\nirreducible twist. They contain as a special case that of the 4-dimensional\nTwisted Eguchi-Kawai model for a symmetric twist with flux $k$. Our results\nallow us to analyze the finite volume corrections as a function of the flux. In\nparticular, one can quantify the approach to volume independence at large $N$\nas a function of flux $k$. The contribution of fermion fields in the adjoint\nrepresentation is also analyzed.\n", "  Complex systems have been widely studied by social and natural scientists in\nterms of their dynamics and their structure. Scholars of cities and urban\nplanning have incorporated complexity theories from qualitative and\nquantitative perspectives. From a structural standpoint, the urban form may be\ncharacterized by the morphological complexity of its circulation networks -\nparticularly their density, resilience, centrality, and connectedness. This\ndissertation unpacks theories of nonlinearity and complex systems, then\ndevelops a framework for assessing the complexity of urban form and street\nnetworks. It introduces a new tool, OSMnx, to collect street network and other\nurban form data for anywhere in the world, then analyze and visualize them.\nFinally, it presents a large empirical study of 27,000 street networks,\nexamining their metric and topological complexity relevant to urban design,\ntransportation research, and the human experience of the built environment.\n"]}
