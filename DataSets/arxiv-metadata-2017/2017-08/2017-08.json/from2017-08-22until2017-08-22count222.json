Our\nclassification is based on the notion of quaternion type. Using this\nclassification we develop a method for analyzing of commutators and\nanticommutators of Clifford algebra elements. This method allows us to find out\nand prove a number of new properties of Clifford algebra elements.\n", "  We illustrate the dimensional regularization technique using a simple problem\nfrom elementary electrostatics. We contrast this approach with the cutoff\nregularization approach, and demonstrate that dimensional regularization\npreserves the translational symmetry. We then introduce a Minimal Subtraction\n(MS) and a Modified Minimal Subtraction (MS-Bar) scheme to renormalize the\nresult. Finally, we consider dimensional transmutation as encountered in the\ncase of compact extra-dimensions.\n", "  In this paper we further develop the method of quaternion typification of\nClifford algebra elements suggested by the author in the previous paper. On the\nbasis of new classification of Clifford algebra elements it is possible to\nreveal and prove a number of new properties of Clifford algebra. We use k-fold\ncommutators and anticommutators. In this paper we consider Clifford and\nexterior degrees and elementary functions of Clifford algebra elements.\n", "  There are numerous characterizations of Shannon entropy and Tsallis entropy\nas measures of information obeying certain properties. Using work by Faddeev\nand Furuichi, we derive a very simple characterization. Instead of focusing on\nthe entropy of a probability measure on a finite set, this characterization\nfocuses on the `information loss', or change in entropy, associated with a\nmeasure-preserving function. Information loss is a special case of conditional\nentropy: namely, it is the entropy of a random variable conditioned on some\nfunction of that variable. We show that Shannon entropy gives the only concept\nof information loss that is functorial, convex-linear and continuous. This\ncharacterization naturally generalizes to Tsallis entropy as well.\n", "  Noether's theorem links the symmetries of a quantum system with its conserved\nquantities, and is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. Here we prove a version\nof Noether's theorem for Markov processes. In quantum mechanics, an observable\ncommutes with the Hamiltonian if and only if its expected value remains\nconstant in time for every state. For Markov processes that no longer holds,\nbut an observable commutes with the Hamiltonian if and only if both its\nexpected value and standard deviation are constant in time for every state.\n", "  We show that general relativity can be viewed as a higher gauge theory\ninvolving a categorical group, or 2-group, called the teleparallel 2-group. On\nany semi-Riemannian manifold M, we first construct a principal 2-bundle with\nthe Poincare 2-group as its structure 2-group. Any flat metric-preserving\nconnection on M gives a flat 2-connection on this 2-bundle, and the key\ningredient of this 2-connection is the torsion. Conversely, every flat strict\n2-connection on this 2-bundle arises in this way if M is simply connected and\nhas vanishing 2nd deRham cohomology. Extending from the Poincare 2-group to the\nteleparallel 2-group, a 2-connection includes an additional piece: a coframe\nfield. Taking advantage of the teleparallel reformulation of general\nrelativity, which uses a coframe field, a flat connection and its torsion, this\nlets us rewrite general relativity as a theory with a 2-connection for the\nteleparallel 2-group as its only field.\n", "  Understanding the exceptional Lie groups as the symmetry groups of simpler\nobjects is a long-standing program in mathematics. Here, we explore one famous\nrealization of the smallest exceptional Lie group, G2. Its Lie algebra acts\nlocally as the symmetries of a ball rolling on a larger ball, but only when the\nratio of radii is 1:3. Using the split octonions, we devise a similar, but more\nglobal, picture of G2: it acts as the symmetries of a 'spinorial ball rolling\non a projective plane', again when the ratio of radii is 1:3. We explain this\nratio in simple terms, use the dot product and cross product of split octonions\nto describe the G2 incidence geometry, and show how a form of geometric\nquantization applied to this geometry lets us recover the imaginary split\noctonions and these operations.\n", "  In the model of holographic dark energy, there is a notorious problem of\ncircular reasoning between the introduction of future event horizon and the\naccelerating expansion of the universe. We examine the problem after dividing\ninto two parts, the causality problem of the equation of motion and the\ncircular logic on the use of the future event horizon. We specify and isolate\nthe root of the problem from causal equation of motion as a boundary condition,\nwhich can be determined from the initial data of the universe. We show that\nthere is no violation of causality if it is defined appropriately and the\ncircular logic problem can be reduced to an initial value problem.\n", "  Maximum entropy models are increasingly being used to describe the collective\nactivity of neural populations with measured mean neural activities and\npairwise correlations, but the full space of probability distributions\nconsistent with these constraints has not been explored. We provide upper and\nlower bounds on the entropy for the {\\em minimum} entropy distribution over\narbitrarily large collections of binary units with any fixed set of mean values\nand pairwise correlations. We also construct specific low-entropy distributions\nfor several relevant cases. Surprisingly, the minimum entropy solution has\nentropy scaling logarithmically with system size for any set of first- and\nsecond-order statistics consistent with arbitrarily large systems. We further\ndemonstrate that some sets of these low-order statistics can only be realized\nby small systems. Our results show how only small amounts of randomness are\nneeded to mimic low-order statistical properties of highly entropic\ndistributions, and we discuss some applications for engineered and biological\ninformation transmission systems.\n", "  How phase transitions affect the motion of moist atmospheric air remains\ncontroversial. In the early 2000s two distinct differential equations of motion\nwere proposed. Besides their contrasting formulations for the acceleration of\ncondensate, the equations differ concerning the presence/absence of a term\nequal to the rate of phase transitions multiplied by the difference in velocity\nbetween condensate and air. This term was interpreted in the literature as the\n\"reactive motion\" associated with condensation. The reasoning behind this\n\"reactive motion\" was that when water vapor condenses and droplets begin to\nfall the remaining gas must move upwards to conserve momentum. Here we show\nthat the two contrasting formulations imply distinct assumptions about how\ngaseous air and condensate particles interact. We show that these assumptions\ncannot be simultaneously applicable to condensation and evaporation. \"Reactive\nmotion\" leading to an upward acceleration of air during condensation does not\nexist. The \"reactive motion\" term can be justified for evaporation only; it\ndescribes the downward acceleration of air. We emphasize the difference between\nthe equations of motion (i.e., equations constraining velocity) and those\nconstraining momentum (i.e., equations of motion and continuity combined). We\nshow that, owing to the imprecise nature of the continuity equations,\nconsideration of total momentum can be misleading and that this led to the\n\"reactive motion\" controversy. Finally, we provide a revised and generally\napplicable equation for the motion of moist air.\n", "  Anderson, Craciun, and Kurtz have proved that a stochastically modelled\nchemical reaction system with mass-action kinetics admits a stationary\ndistribution when the deterministic model of the same system with mass-action\nkinetics admits an equilibrium solution obeying a certain \"complex balance\"\ncondition. Here we present a proof of their theorem using tools from the theory\nof second quantization: Fock space, annihilation and creation operators, and\ncoherent states. This is an example of \"stochastic mechanics\", where we take\ntechniques from quantum mechanics and replace amplitudes by probabilities.\n", "  We construct the quantum curve for the Gromov-Witten theory of the complex\nprojective line.\n", "  Maldacena and Susskind have proposed a correspondence between wormholes and\nentanglement, dubbed ER=EPR. We study this in the context of 3d topological\nquantum field theory, where we show that the formation of a wormhole is the\nsame process as creating a particle-antiparticle pair. A key feature of the\nER=EPR proposal is that certain apparently entangled degrees of freedom turn\nout to be the same. We name this phenomenon \"fake entanglement\", and show how\nit arises in our topological quantum field theory model.\n", "  We give a new characterization of relative entropy, also known as the\nKullback-Leibler divergence. We use a number of interesting categories related\nto probability theory. In particular, we consider a category FinStat where an\nobject is a finite set equipped with a probability distribution, while a\nmorphism is a measure-preserving function $f: X \\to Y$ together with a\nstochastic right inverse $s: Y \\to X$. The function $f$ can be thought of as a\nmeasurement process, while s provides a hypothesis about the state of the\nmeasured system given the result of a measurement. Given this data we can\ndefine the entropy of the probability distribution on $X$ relative to the\n\"prior\" given by pushing the probability distribution on $Y$ forwards along\n$s$. We say that $s$ is \"optimal\" if these distributions agree. We show that\nany convex linear, lower semicontinuous functor from FinStat to the additive\nmonoid $[0,\\infty]$ which vanishes when $s$ is optimal must be a scalar\nmultiple of this relative entropy. Our proof is independent of all earlier\ncharacterizations, but inspired by the work of Petz.\n", "  In the present paper, directivity patterns of laser-generated sound in solids\nare investigated theoretically. Two main approaches to the calculation of\ndirectivity patterns of laser-generated sound are discussed for the most\nimportant case of thermo-optical regime of generation. The first approach,\nwhich is widely used in practice, is based on the simple modelling of the\nequivalent thermo-optical source as a mechanical dipole comprising two\nhorizontal forces applied to the surface in opposite directions. The second\napproach is based on the rigorous theory that takes into account all\nacoustical, optical and thermal parameters of a solid material and all\ngeometrical and physical parameters of a laser beam. Directivity patterns of\nlaser-generated bulk longitudinal and shear elastic waves, as well as the\namplitudes of generated Rayleigh surface waves, are calculated for different\nvalues of physical and geometrical parameters and compared with the directivity\npatterns calculated in case of dipole-source representation. It is demonstrated\nthat the simple approach using a dipole-source representation of\nlaser-generated sound is rather limited, especially for description of\ngenerated longitudinal acoustic waves. A practical criterion is established to\ndefine the conditions under which the dipole-source representation gives\npredictions with acceptable errors. It is shown that, for radiation in the\nnormal direction to the surface, the amplitudes of longitudinal waves are\nespecially sensitive to the values of thermal parameters and of the acoustic\nreflection coefficient from a free solid surface. A discussion is given on the\npossibility of using such a high sensitivity to the values of the reflection\ncoefficient for investigation of surface properties of real solids.\n", "  Control theory uses \"signal-flow diagrams\" to describe processes where\nreal-valued functions of time are added, multiplied by scalars, differentiated\nand integrated, duplicated and deleted. These diagrams can be seen as string\ndiagrams for the symmetric monoidal category FinVect_k of finite-dimensional\nvector spaces over the field of rational functions k = R(s), where the variable\ns acts as differentiation and the monoidal structure is direct sum rather than\nthe usual tensor product of vector spaces. For any field k we give a\npresentation of FinVect_k in terms of the generators used in signal flow\ndiagrams. A broader class of signal-flow diagrams also includes \"caps\" and\n\"cups\" to model feedback. We show these diagrams can be seen as string diagrams\nfor the symmetric monoidal category FinRel_k, where objects are still\nfinite-dimensional vector spaces but the morphisms are linear relations. We\nalso give a presentation for FinRel_k. The relations say, among other things,\nthat the 1-dimensional vector space k has two special commutative\ndagger-Frobenius structures, such that the multiplication and unit of either\none and the comultiplication and counit of the other fit together to form a\nbimonoid. This sort of structure, but with tensor product replacing direct sum,\nis familiar from the \"ZX-calculus\" obeyed by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space\nwith two mutually unbiased bases.\n", "  Using spectral sequences techniques we compute the bihamiltonian cohomology\ngroups of the pencil of Poisson brackets of dispersionless KdV hierarchy. In\nparticular this proves a conjecture of Liu and Zhang about the vanishing of\nsuch cohomology groups.\n", "  The geometry of the dual amplituhedron is generally described in reference to\na particular triangulation. A given triangulation manifests only certain\naspects of the underlying space while obscuring others, therefore understanding\nthis geometry without reference to a particular triangulation is desirable. In\nthis note we introduce a new formalism for computing the volumes of general\npolytopes in any dimension. We define new \"vertex objects\" and introduce a\ncalculus for expressing volumes of polytopes in terms of them. These\nexpressions are unique, independent of any triangulation, manifestly depend\nonly on the vertices of the underlying polytope, and can be used to easily\nderive identities amongst different triangulations. As one application of this\nformalism, we obtain new expressions for the volume of the tree-level,\n$n$-point NMHV dual amplituhedron.\n", "  In this article we present a possible way to make usual quantum mechanics\nfully compatible with physical realism, defined as the statement that the goal\nof physics is to study entities of the natural world, existing independently\nfrom any particular observer's perception, and obeying universal and\nintelligible rules. Rather than elaborating on the quantum formalism itself, we\npropose to modify the quantum ontology, by requiring that physical properties\nare attributed jointly to the system, and to the context in which it is\nembedded. In combination with a quantization principle, this non-classical\ndefinition of physical reality sheds new light on counter-intuitive features of\nquantum mechanics such as the origin of probabilities, non-locality, and the\nquantum-classical boundary.\n", "  We consider parameter estimations with probes being the boundary\ndriven/dissipated non- equilibrium steady states of XXZ spin 1/2 chains. The\nparameters to be estimated are the dissipation coupling and the anisotropy of\nthe spin-spin interaction. In the weak coupling regime we compute the scaling\nof the Fisher information, i.e. the inverse best sensitivity among all\nestimators, with the number of spins. We find superlinear scalings and\ntransitions between the distinct, isotropic and anisotropic, phases. We also\nlook at the best relative error which decreases with the number of particles\nfaster than the shot-noise only for the estimation of anisotropy.\n", "  We study the set of solutions $(\\omega_{g,n})_{g \\geq 0,n \\geq 1}$ of\nabstract loop equations. We prove that $\\omega_{g,n}$ is determined by its\npurely holomorphic part: this results in a decomposition that we call \"blobbed\ntopological recursion\". This is a generalization of the theory of the\ntopological recursion, in which the initial data $(\\omega_{0,1},\\omega_{0,2})$\nis enriched by non-zero symmetric holomorphic forms in $n$ variables\n$(\\phi_{g,n})_{2g - 2 + n > 0}$. In particular, we establish for any solution\nof abstract loop equations: (1) a graphical representation of $\\omega_{g,n}$ in\nterms of $\\phi_{g,n}$; (2) a graphical representation of $\\omega_{g,n}$ in\nterms of intersection numbers on the moduli space of curves; (3) variational\nformulae under infinitesimal transformation of $\\phi_{g,n}$ ; (4) a definition\nfor the free energies $\\omega_{g,0} = F_g$ respecting the variational formulae.\nWe discuss in detail the application to the multi-trace matrix model and\nenumeration of stuffed maps.\n", "  We analyze Chiodo's formulas for the Chern classes related to the r-th roots\nof the suitably twisted integer powers of the canonical class on the moduli\nspace of curves. The intersection numbers of these classes with psi-classes are\nreproduced via the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. As an\napplication, we prove that the Johnson-Pandharipande-Tseng formula for the\norbifold Hurwitz numbers is equivalent to the topological recursion for the\norbifold Hurwitz numbers. In particular, this gives a new proof of the\ntopological recursion for the orbifold Hurwitz numbers.\n", "  In this paper we present an example of a derivation of an ELSV-type formula\nusing the methods of topological recursion. Namely, for orbifold Hurwitz\nnumbers we give a new proof of the spectral curve topological recursion, in the\nsense of Chekhov, Eynard, and Orantin, where the main new step compared to the\nexisting proofs is a direct combinatorial proof of their quasi-polynomiality.\nSpectral curve topological recursion leads to a formula for the orbifold\nHurwitz numbers in terms of the intersection theory of the moduli space of\ncurves, which, in this case, appears to coincide with a special case of the\nJohnson-Pandharipande-Tseng formula.\n", "  The kinetic energy budget of the atmosphere's meridional circulation cells is\nanalytically assessed. In the upper atmosphere kinetic energy generation grows\nwith increasing surface temperature difference \\$\\Delta T_s\\$ between the cold\nand warm ends of a circulation cell; in the lower atmosphere it declines. A\nrequirement that kinetic energy generation is positive in the lower atmosphere\nlimits the poleward cell extension \\$L\\$ of Hadley cells via a relationship\nbetween \\$\\Delta T_s\\$ and surface pressure difference \\$\\Delta p_s\\$: an upper\nlimit exists when \\$\\Delta p_s\\$ does not grow with increasing \\$\\Delta T_s\\$.\nThis pattern is demonstrated here using monthly data from MERRA re-analysis.\nKinetic energy generation along air streamlines in the boundary layer does not\nexceed \\$40\\$~J~mol\\$^{-1}\\$; it declines with growing \\$L\\$ and reaches zero\nfor the largest observed \\$L\\$ at 2~km height. The limited meridional cell size\nnecessitates the appearance of heat pumps -- circulation cells with negative\nwork output where the low-level air moves towards colder areas. These cells\nconsume the positive work output of the heat engines -- cells where the\nlow-level air moves towards the warmer areas -- and can in theory drive the\nglobal efficiency of atmospheric circulation down to zero. Relative\ncontributions of \\$\\Delta p_s\\$ and \\$\\Delta T_s\\$ to kinetic energy generation\nare evaluated: \\$\\Delta T_s\\$ dominates in the upper atmosphere, while \\$\\Delta\np_s\\$ dominates in the lower. Analysis and empirical evidence indicate that the\nnet kinetic power output on Earth is dominated by surface pressure gradients,\nwith minor net kinetic energy generation in the upper atmosphere. The role of\ncondensation in generating surface pressure gradients is discussed.\n", "  We compute the bi-Hamiltonian cohomology of an arbitrary dispersionless\nPoisson pencil in a single dependent variable using a spectral sequence method.\nAs in the KdV case, we obtain that $BH^p_d(\\hat{F}, d_1,d_2)$ is isomorphic to\n$\\mathbb{R}$ for $(p,d)=(0,0)$, to $C^\\infty (\\mathbb{R})$ for $(p,d)=(1,1)$,\n$(2,1)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,3)$, and vanishes otherwise.\n", "  We define the concept of an \"open\" Markov process, or more precisely,\ncontinuous-time Markov chain, which is one where probability can flow in or out\nof certain states called \"inputs\" and \"outputs\". One can build up a Markov\nprocess from smaller open pieces. This process is formalized by making open\nMarkov processes into the morphisms of a dagger compact category. We show that\nthe behavior of a detailed balanced open Markov process is determined by a\nprinciple of minimum dissipation, closely related to Prigogine's principle of\nminimum entropy production. Using this fact, we set up a functor mapping open\ndetailed balanced Markov processes to open circuits made of linear resistors.\nWe also describe how to \"black box\" an open Markov process, obtaining the\nlinear relation between input and output data that holds in any steady state,\nincluding nonequilibrium steady states with a nonzero flow of probability\nthrough the system. We prove that black boxing gives a symmetric monoidal\ndagger functor sending open detailed balanced Markov processes to Lagrangian\nrelations between symplectic vector spaces. This allows us to compute the\nsteady state behavior of an open detailed balanced Markov process from the\nbehaviors of smaller pieces from which it is built. We relate this black box\nfunctor to a previously constructed black box functor for circuits.\n", "  We present theoretical and practical properties of the affine-invariant\nensemble sampler Markov chain Monte Carlo method. In high dimensions the\naffine-invariant ensemble sampler shows unusual and undesirable properties. We\ndemonstrate this with an $n$-dimensional correlated Gaussian toy problem with a\nknown mean and covariance structure, and analyse the burn-in period. The\nburn-in period seems to be short, however upon closer inspection we discover\nthe mean and the variance of the target distribution do not match the expected,\nknown values. This problem becomes greater as $n$ increases. We therefore\nconclude that the affine-invariant ensemble sampler should be used with caution\nin high dimensional problems. We also present some theoretical results\nexplaining this behaviour.\n", "  We present a study of a star formation prescription in which star formation\nefficiency depends on local gas density and turbulent velocity dispersion, as\nsuggested by direct simulations of SF in turbulent giant molecular clouds\n(GMCs). We test the model using a simulation of an isolated Milky Way-sized\ngalaxy with a self-consistent treatment of turbulence on unresolved scales. We\nshow that this prescription predicts a wide variation of local star formation\nefficiency per free-fall time, $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff} \\sim 0.1 - 10\\%$, and gas\ndepletion time, $t_{\\rm dep} \\sim 0.1 - 10$ Gyr. In addition, it predicts an\neffective density threshold for star formation due to suppression of\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$ in warm diffuse gas stabilized by thermal pressure. We show\nthat the model predicts star formation rates in agreement with observations\nfrom the scales of individual star-forming regions to the kiloparsec scales.\nThis agreement is non-trivial, as the model was not tuned in any way and the\npredicted star formation rates on all scales are determined by the distribution\nof the GMC-scale densities and turbulent velocities $\\sigma$ in the cold gas\nwithin the galaxy, which is shaped by galactic dynamics. The broad agreement of\nthe star formation prescription calibrated in the GMC-scale simulations with\nobservations, both gives credence to such simulations and promises to put star\nformation modeling in galaxy formation simulations on a much firmer theoretical\nfooting.\n", "  In this paper we revisit several recent results on monotone and strictly\nmonotone Hurwitz numbers, providing new proofs. In particular, we use various\nversions of these numbers to discuss methods of derivation of quantum spectral\ncurves from the point of view of KP integrability and derive new examples of\nquantum curves for the families of double Hurwitz numbers.\n", "  We discuss the recently observed \"loophole free\" violation of Bell's\ninequalities in the framework of a physically realist view of quantum\nmechanics, which requires that physical properties are attributed jointly to a\nsystem, and to the context in which it is embedded. This approach is clearly\ndifferent from classical realism, but it does define a meaningful \"quantum\nrealism\" from a general philosophical point of view. Consistently with Bell\ntest experiments, this quantum realism embeds some form of non-locality, but\ndoes not contain any action at a distance, in agreement with quantum mechanics.\n", "  The contribution of the valence electrons to the Compton profiles of the\nalkali metals is calculated using density functional theory. We show that the\nCompton profiles can be modeled by a $q-$Gaussian distribution, which is\ncharacterized by an anisotropic, element dependent parameter $q$. Thereby we\nderive an unexpected scaling behavior of the Compton profiles of all alkali\nmetals.\n", "  We present a detailed study of two novel methods for shaping the light\noptical wavefront by employing a transmissive spatial light modulator (SLM).\nConventionally, optical Airy beams are created by employing SLMs in the\nso-called all phase mode. In the first method, a numerically simulated lens\nphase distribution is loaded directly onto the SLM, together with the cubic\nphase distribution. An Airy beam is generated at the focal plane of the\nnumerical lens. We provide for the first time a quantitative properties of the\nformed Airy beam. We derive the formula for deflection of the intensity maximum\nof the so formed Airy beam, which is different to the quadratic deflection\ntypical of Airy beams. We cross-validate the derived formula by both\nsimulations and experiment. The second method is based on the fact that a\nsystem consisting of a transmissive SLM sandwiched between two polarisers can\ncreate a transmission function with negative values. This observation alone has\nthe potential for various other wavefront modulations where the transmission\nfunction requires negative values. As an example for this method, we\ndemonstrate that a wavefront can be modulated by passing the SLM system with\ntransmission function with negative values by loading an Airy function\ndistribution directly onto SLM. Since the Airy function is a real-valued\nfunction but also with negative values, an Airy beam can be generated by direct\ntransfer of the Airy function distribution onto such an SLM system. In this\nway, an Airy beam is generated immediately behind the SLM. As both new methods\ndo not employ a physical lens, the two setups are more compact than\nconventional setups for creating Airy beams. We compare the performance of the\ntwo novel methods and the properties of the created Airy beams.\n", "  The power of atmospheric circulation is a key measure of the Earth's climate\nsystem. The mismatch between predictions and observations under a warming\nclimate calls for a reassessment of how atmospheric power $W$ is defined,\nestimated and constrained. Here we review published formulations for $W$ and\nshow how they differ when applied to a moist atmosphere. Three factors, a\nnon-zero source/sink in the continuity equation, the difference between\nvelocities of gaseous air and condensate, and interaction between the gas and\ncondensate modifying the equations of motion, affect the formulation of $W$.\nStarting from the thermodynamic definition of mechanical work, we derive an\nexpression for $W$ from an explicit consideration of the equations of motion\nand continuity. Our analyses clarify how some past formulations are incomplete\nor invalid. Three caveats are identified. First, $W$ critically depends on the\nboundary condition for gaseous air velocity at the Earth's surface. Second,\nconfusion between gaseous air velocity and mean velocity of air and condensate\nin the expression for $W$ results in gross errors despite the observed\nmagnitudes of these velocities are very close. Third, $W$ expressed in terms of\nmeasurable atmospheric parameters, air pressure and velocity, is\nscale-specific; this must be taken into account when adding contributions to\n$W$ from different processes. We present a formulation of the atmospheric power\nbudget, which distinguishes three components of $W$: the kinetic power\nassociated with horizontal pressure gradients ($W_K$), the gravitational power\nof precipitation ($W_P$) and the condensate loading ($W_c$). We use MERRA and\nNCAR/NCEP re-analyses to evaluate the atmospheric power budget at different\nscales: $W_K$ increases with temporal resolution approaching our theoretical\nestimate for condensation-induced circulation when all convective motion is\nresolved.\n", "  We study the spontaneous decay of an impurity coupled to a linear array of\nbosonic cavities forming a single-band photonic waveguide. The average\nfrequency of the emitted photon is different from the frequency for\nsingle-photon resonant scattering, which perfectly matches the bare frequency\nof the excited state of the impurity. We study how the energy of the excited\nstate of the impurity influences the spatial profile of the emitted photon. The\nfarther the energy is from the middle of the photonic band, the farther the\nwave packet is from the causal limit. In particular, if the energy lies in the\nmiddle of the band, the wave packet is localized around the causal limit.\nBesides, the occupation of the excited state of the impurity presents a rich\ndynamics: it shows an exponential decay up to intermediate times, this is\nfollowed by a power-law tail in the long-time regime, and it finally reaches an\noscillatory stationary regime. Finally, we show that this phenomenology is\nrobust under the presence of losses, both in the impurity and the cavities.\n", "  Single crystals of undoped CaFe2As2 were grown by a FeAs self-flux method,\nand the crystals were quenched in ice-water rapidly after high temperature\ngrowth. The quenched crystal undergoes a collapsed tetragonal structural phase\ntransition around 80 K revealed by the temperature dependent X-ray diffraction\nmeasurements. Superconductivity below 25 K was observed in the collapsed phase\nby resistivity and magnetization measurements. The isothermal magnetization\ncurve measured at 2 K indicates that this is a typical type-II superconductor.\nFor comparison, we systematically characterized the properties of the furnace\ncooled, quenched, and post-annealed single crystals, and found strong internal\ncrystallographic strain existing in the quenched samples, which is the key for\nthe occurrence of superconductivity in the undoped CaFe2As2 single crystals.\n", "  Despite the dangers associated with tropical cyclones and their rainfall, the\norigins of storm moisture remains unclear. Existing studies have focused on the\nregion 40-400 km from the cyclone center. It is known that the rainfall within\nthis area cannot be explained by local processes alone but requires imported\nmoisture. Nonetheless, the dynamics of this imported moisture appears unknown.\nHere, considering a region up to three thousand kilometers from storm center,\nwe analyze precipitation, atmospheric moisture and movement velocities for\nNorth Atlantic hurricanes. Our findings indicate that even over such large\nareas a hurricane's rainfall cannot be accounted for by concurrent evaporation.\nWe propose instead that a hurricane consumes pre-existing atmospheric water\nvapor as it moves. The propagation velocity of the cyclone, i.e. the difference\nbetween its movement velocity and the mean velocity of the surrounding air\n(steering flow), determines the water vapor budget. Water vapor available to\nthe hurricane through its movement makes the hurricane self-sufficient at about\n700 km from the hurricane center obviating the need to concentrate moisture\nfrom greater distances. Such hurricanes leave a dry wake, whereby rainfall is\nsuppressed by up to 40 per cent compared to its long-term mean. The inner\nradius of this dry footprint approximately coincides with the radius of\nhurricane self-sufficiency with respect to water vapor. We discuss how Carnot\nefficiency considerations do not constrain the power of such open systems that\ndeplete the pre-existing moisture. Our findings emphasize the incompletely\nunderstood role and importance of atmospheric moisture supplies, condensation\nand precipitation in hurricane dynamics.\n", "  We study the loop $O(n)$ model on the honeycomb lattice. By means of local\nnon-planar deformations of the lattice, we construct a discrete stress-energy\ntensor. For $n\\in [-2,2]$, it gives a new observable satisfying a part of\nCauchy-Riemann equations. We conjecture that it is approximately\ndiscrete-holomorphic and converges to the stress-energy tensor in the\ncontinuum, which is known to be a holomorphic function with the Schwarzian\nconformal covariance. In support of this conjecture, we prove it for the case\nof $n=1$ which corresponds to the Ising model. Moreover, in this case, we show\nthat the correlations of the discrete stress-energy tensor with primary fields\nconverge to their continuous counterparts, which satisfy the OPEs given by the\nCFT with central charge $c=1/2$.\n  Proving the conjecture for other values of $n$ remains a challenge. In\nparticular, this would open a road to establishing the convergence of the\ninterface to the corresponding $\\mathrm{SLE}_\\kappa$ in the scaling limit.\n", "  Localized representation of the Kohn-Sham subspace plays an important role in\nquantum chemistry and materials science. The recently developed selected\ncolumns of the density matrix (SCDM) method [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 11, 1463,\n2015] is a simple and robust procedure for finding a localized representation\nof a set of Kohn-Sham orbitals from an insulating system. The SCDM method\nallows the direct construction of a well conditioned (or even orthonormal) and\nlocalized basis for the Kohn-Sham subspace. The SCDM algorithm avoids the use\nof an optimization procedure and does not depend on any adjustable parameters.\nThe most computationally expensive step of the SCDM method is a column pivoted\nQR factorization that identifies the important columns for constructing the\nlocalized basis set. In this paper, we develop a two stage approximate column\nselection strategy to find the important columns at much lower computational\ncost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this process using the dissociation\nprocess of a BH$_3$NH$_3$ molecule, an alkane chain and a supercell with 256\nwater molecules. Numerical results for the large collection of water molecules\nshow that two stage localization procedure can be more than 30 times faster\nthan the original SCDM algorithm and compares favorably with the popular\nWannier90 package.\n", "  We model a sonic black hole analog in a quasi one-dimensional Bose-Einstein\ncondensate, using a Gross-Pitaevskii equation matching the configuration of a\nrecent experiment by Steinhauer [Nat. Phys. 10, 864 (2014)]. The model agrees\nwell with important features of the experimental observations, demonstrating\ntheir hydrodynamic nature. We find that a zero-frequency bow wave is generated\nat the inner (white hole) horizon, which grows in proportion to the square of\nthe background condensate density. The relative motion of the black and white\nhole horizons produces a Doppler shift of the bow wave at the black hole, where\nit stimulates the emission of monochromatic Hawking radiation. The mechanism is\nconfirmed using temporal and spatial windowed Fourier spectra of the\ncondensate. Mean field behavior similar to that in the experiment can thus be\nfully explained without the presence of self-amplifying Hawking radiation.\n", "  Ion channels play a key role in regulating cell behavior and in electrical\nsignaling. In these settings, polar and charged functional groups -- as well as\nprotein response -- compensate for dehydration in an ion-dependent way, giving\nrise to the ion selective transport critical to the operation of cells.\nDehydration, though, yields ion-dependent free-energy barriers and thus is\npredicted to give rise to selectivity by itself. However, these barriers are\ntypically so large that they will suppress the ion currents to undetectable\nlevels. Here, we establish that graphene displays a measurable dehydration-only\nmechanism for selectivity of $\\mathrm{K}^+$ over $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$. This\nfundamental mechanism -- one that depends only on the geometry and hydration --\nis the starting point for selectivity for all channels and pores. Moreover,\nwhile we study selectivity of $\\mathrm{K}^+$ over $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$, we find that\ndehydration-based selectivity functions for all ions, i.e., cation over cation\nselectivity (e.g., $\\mathrm{K}^+$ over $\\mathrm{Na}^+$). Its likely detection\nin graphene pores resolves conflicting experimental results, as well as\npresents a new paradigm for characterizing the operation of ion channels and\nengineering molecular/ionic selectivity in filtration and other applications.\n", "  We study the massive ODE/IM correspondence for modified $B_2^{(1)}$ affine\nToda field equation. Based on the $\\psi$-system for the solutions of the\nassociated linear problem, we obtain the Bethe ansatz equations. We also\ndiscuss the T-Q relations, the T-system and the Y-system, which are shown to be\nrelated to those of the $A_3/{\\bf Z}_2$ integrable system. We consider the case\nthat the solution of the linear problem has a monodromy around the origin,\nwhich imposes nontrivial boundary conditions for the T-/Y-system. The\nhigh-temperature limit of the T- and Y-system and their monodromy dependence\nare studied numerically.\n", "  Nanoscale magnetic junction provides a useful approach to act as the building\nblock for magnetoresistive random access memories (MRAM), where one of the key\nissues is to control the magnetic domain configuration. Here, we study the\ndomain structure and the magnetic switching in the Permalloy (Fe20Ni80)\nnanoscale magnetic junctions with different thicknesses by using micromagnetic\nsimulations. It is found that both the 90-degree and 45-degree domain walls can\nbe formed between the junctions and the wire arms depending on the thickness of\nthe device. The magnetic switching fields show distinct thickness dependencies\nwith a broad peak varying from 7 nm to 22 nm depending on the junction sizes,\nand the large magnetic switching fields favor the stability of the MRAM\noperation.\n", "  Nanoscale CoFeB amorphous films have been synthesized on GaAs(100) and\nstudied with X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM). We have found that the ratios of the orbital to spin magnetic\nmoments of both the Co and Fe in the ultrathin amorphous film have been\nenhanced by more than 300% compared with those of the bulk crystalline Co and\nFe, and in specifically, a large orbital moment of 0.56*10^-6 B from the Co\natoms has been observed and at the same time the spin moment of the Co atoms\nremains comparable to that of the bulk hcp Co. The results indicate that the\nlarge uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) observed in the ultrathin CoFeB film\non GaAs(100) is related to the enhanced spin-orbital coupling of the Co atoms\nin the CoFeB. This work offers experimental evidences of the correlation\nbetween the UMA and the elementary specific spin and orbital moments in the\nCoFeB amorphous film on the GaAs(100) substrate, which is significant for\nspintronics applications.\n", "  The exotic normal state of iron chalcogenide superconductor FeSe, which\nexhibits vanishing magnetic order and possesses an electronic nematic order,\ntriggered extensive explorations of its magnetic ground state. To understand\nits novel properties, we study the ground state of a highly frustrated spin-$1$\nsystem with bilinear-biquadratic interactions using unbiased large-scale\ndensity matrix renormalization group. Remarkably, with increasing biquadratic\ninteractions, we find a paramagnetic phase between N\\'eel and stripe magnetic\nordered phases. We identify this phase as a candidate of nematic quantum spin\nliquid by the compelling evidences, including vanished spin and quadrupolar\norders, absence of lattice translational symmetry breaking, and a persistent\nnon-zero lattice nematic order in the thermodynamic limit. The established\nquantum phase diagram natually explains the observations of enhanced spin\nfluctuations of FeSe in neutron scattering measurement and the phase transition\nwith increasing pressure. This identified paramagnetic phase provides a new\npossibility to understand the novel properties of FeSe.\n", "  In this work we consider minimally-coupled boson stars immersed in a tidal\nenvironment and compute their tidal deformability to leading order. We also\ndescribe an approximate correspondence between Newtonian boson star\nconfigurations (described by the Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Poisson equations) and\ndynamical dark matter clumps (described by the collisionless Boltzmann\nequation). This allows us to map our results for the tidal deformability of\nboson stars to approximate statements for dark matter clumps.\n", "  We develop a sheaf theory approach to toric noncommutative geometry which\nallows us to formalize the concept of mapping spaces between two toric\nnoncommutative spaces. As an application we study the `internalized'\nautomorphism group of a toric noncommutative space and show that its Lie\nalgebra has an elementary description in terms of braided derivations.\n", "  While topological quantum computation is intrinsically fault-tolerant at zero\ntemperature, it loses its topological protection at any finite temperature. We\npresent a scheme to protect the information stored in a system supporting\nnon-cyclic anyons against thermal and measurement errors. The correction\nprocedure builds on the work of G\\'acs [Gacs 1986] and Harrington [Harrington\n2004] and operates as a local cellular automaton. In contrast to previously\nstudied schemes, our scheme is valid for both abelian and non-abelian anyons\nand accounts for measurement errors. We analytically prove the existence of a\nfault-tolerant threshold for a certain class of non-Abelian anyon models, and\nnumerically simulate the procedure for the specific example of Ising anyons.\nThe result of our simulations are consistent with a threshold between $10^{-4}$\nand $10^{-3}$.\n", "  It was recently shown that a finite imbalance between electron densities in\nthe $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{K}'$ valleys of bilayer graphene induces a\nmagnetoelectric coupling. Here we explore ramifications of this electronically\ntunable magnetoelectric effect for the optical conductivity and dielectric\npermittivity of this material. Our results augment current understanding of\nlongitudinal magnetoresistance and magnetocapacitance in unconventional\nmaterials.\n", "  In this paper we consider some Lie groups in complexified Clifford algebras.\nUsing relations between operations of conjugation in Clifford algebras and\nmatrix operations we prove isomorphisms between these groups and classical\nmatrix groups (symplectic, orthogonal, linear, unitary) in the cases of\narbitrary dimension and arbitrary signature. Also we obtain isomorphisms of\ncorresponding Lie algebras which are direct sums of subspaces of quaternion\ntypes. Spin group is a subgroup of all considered groups and it coincides with\none of them in the cases $n\\leq 5$. We present classical matrix Lie groups that\ncontain spin group in the case of arbitrary dimension.\n", "  Here we report the synthesis and discovery of superconductivity in a novel\nternary iridium-arsenide compound BaIr2As2. The polycrystalline BaIr2As2 sample\nwas synthesized by a high temperature and high pressure method. Crystal\nstructural analysis indicates that BaIr2As2 crystallizes in the ThCr2Si2-type\nlayered tetragonal structure with space group I4/mmm (No. 139), and the lattice\nparameters were refined to be a = 4.052(9) {\\AA} and c = 12.787(8) {\\AA}. By\nthe electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements we found\ntype-II superconductivity in the new BaIr2As2 compound with a Tc (critical\ntemperature) of 2.45 K, and an upper critical field u0Hc2(0) about 0.2 T. Low\ntemperature specific heat measurements gave a Debye temperature about 202 K and\na distinct specific jump with delta Ce/{\\gamma}Tc = 1.36, which is close to the\nvalue of BCS weak coupling limit and confirms the bulk superconductivity in\nthis new BaIr2As2 compound.\n", "  Many theories describing physics beyond the Standard Model rely on a large\nseparation of scales. Large scale separation arises in models with mass-split\nflavors if the system is conformal in the ultraviolet but chirally broken in\nthe infrared. Because of the conformal fixed point, these systems exhibit\nhyperscaling and a highly constrained resonance spectrum. We derive\nhyperscaling relations and investigate the realization of one such system with\nfour light and eight heavy flavors. Our numerical simulations confirm that both\nlight-light and heavy-heavy resonance masses show hyperscaling and depend only\non the ratio of the light and heavy flavor masses. The heavy-heavy spectrum is\nqualitatively different from QCD and exhibits quarkonia with masses not\nproportional to the constituent quark mass. These resonances are only a few\ntimes heavier than the light-light ones, which would put them within reach of\nthe LHC.\n", "  The early star-forming Universe is still poorly constrained, with the\nproperties of high-redshift stars, the first heating sources, and reionization\nhighly uncertain. This leaves observers planning 21-cm experiments with little\ntheoretical guidance. In this work we explore the possible range of\nhigh-redshift parameters including the star formation efficiency and the\nminimal mass of star-forming halos; the efficiency, spectral energy\ndistribution, and redshift evolution of the first X-ray sources; and the\nhistory of reionization. These parameters are only weakly constrained by\navailable observations, mainly the optical depth to the cosmic microwave\nbackground. We use realistic semi-numerical simulations to produce the global\n21-cm signal over the redshift range $z = 6-40$ for each of 193 different\ncombinations of the astrophysical parameters spanning the allowed range. We\nshow that the expected signal fills a large parameter space, but with a fixed\ngeneral shape for the global 21-cm curve. Even with our wide selection of\nmodels we still find clear correlations between the key features of the global\n21-cm signal and underlying astrophysical properties of the high redshift\nUniverse, namely the Ly$\\alpha$ intensity, the X-ray heating rate, and the\nproduction rate of ionizing photons. These correlations can be used to directly\nlink future measurements of the global 21-cm signal to astrophysical quantities\nin a mostly model-independent way. We identify additional correlations that can\nbe used as consistency checks.\n", "  It has been suggested that the internal dynamics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies\n(dSphs) can be used to test whether or not ultralight axions with $m_a\\sim\n10^{-22}\\text{eV}$ are a preferred dark matter candidate. However, comparisons\nto theoretical predictions tend to be inconclusive for the simple reason that\nwhile most cosmological models consider only dark matter, one observes only\nbaryons. Here we use realistic kinematic mock data catalogs of Milky Way dSph's\nto show that the \"mass-anisotropy degeneracy\" in the Jeans equations leads to\nbiased bounds on the axion mass in galaxies with unknown dark matter halo\nprofiles. In galaxies with multiple chemodynamical components this bias can be\npartly removed by modelling the mass enclosed within each subpopulation.\nHowever, analysis of the mock data reveals that the least-biased constraints on\nthe axion mass result from fitting the luminosity-averaged velocity dispersion\nof the individual chemodynamical components directly. Applying our analysis to\ntwo dSph's with reported stellar subcomponents, Fornax and Sculptor, and\nassuming that the halo profile has not been acted on by baryons, yields core\nradii $r_{c}>1.5$ kpc and $r_c> 1.2$ kpc respectively, and $m_a<0.4\\times\n10^{-22}\\text{eV}$ at 97.5\\% confidence. These bounds are in tension with the\nnumber of observed satellites derived from simple (but conservative) estimates\nof the subhalo mass function in Milky Way-like galaxies. We discuss how\nbaryonic feedback might affect our results, and the impact of such a small\naxion mass on the growth of structures in the Universe.\n", "  Exciting peculiarities of Planck-scale physics have immediate effects on the\nBekenstein-Hawking radiation emitted from black holes (BHs). In this paper,\nusing the tunneling formalism, we determine the Bekenstein-Hawking temperature\nfor the vector particles from a backreacted black hole (BBH) constructed from a\nconformal scalar field surrounded by a BTZ (Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli) BH.\nThen, under the effect of the generalized uncertainty principle, we extend our\ncalculations for scalar particles to understand the effects of quantum gravity.\nThen, we calculate an evaporation time for the BBH, the total number of\nBekenstein-Hawking particles, and the quantum corrections of the number. We\nobserve that remnants of the BH evaporation occur and that they affect the\nBekenstein-Hawking temperature of the BBH as well as the total number of\nBekenstein-Hawking particles.\n", "  In this letter, cosmology of a simple NMDC gravity with $\\xi R\n\\phi_{,\\mu}\\phi^{,\\mu}$ term and a free kinetic term is considered in flat\ngeometry and in presence of dust matter. A logarithm field transformation\n$\\phi' = \\mu \\ln \\phi$ is proposed phenomenologically. Assuming slow-roll\napproximation, equation of motion, scalar field solution and potential are\nderived as function of kinematic variables. The field solution and potential\nare found straightforwardly for power-law, de-Sitter and super-acceleration\nexpansions. Slow-roll parameters and slow-roll condition are found to depend on\nmore than one variable. At large field the re-scaling effect can enhance the\nacceleration. For slow-rolling field, the negative coupling $\\xi$ could enhance\nthe effect of acceleration.\n", "  Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPA) have become key devices in quantum\nscience and technology with superconducting circuits. In particular, they can\nbe utilized as quantum-limited amplifiers or as a source of squeezed microwave\nfields. Here, we report on the detailed measurements of five flux-driven JPAs,\nthree of them exhibiting a hysteretic dependence of the resonant frequency\nversus the applied magnetic flux. We model the measured characteristics by\nnumerical simulations based on the two-dimensional potential landscape of the\ndc superconducting quantum interference devices (dc-SQUID), which provide the\nJPA nonlinearity, for a finite screening parameter $\\beta_\\mathrm{L}\\,{>}\\,0$\nand demonstrate excellent agreement between the numerical results and the\nexperimental data. Furthermore, we study the nondegenerate response of\ndifferent JPAs and accurately describe the experimental results with our\ntheory.\n", "  The fractal dimension growth of urban form can be described with sigmoid\nfunctions such as logistic function due to squashing effect. The sigmoid curves\nof fractal dimension suggest a type of spatial replacement dynamics of urban\nevolution. How to understand the underlying rationale of the fractal dimension\ncurves is a pending problem. This study is based on two previous findings.\nFirst, normalized fractal dimension proved to equal normalized spatial entropy;\nsecond, a sigmoid function proceeds from an urban-rural interaction model.\nDefining urban space-filling measurement by spatial entropy, and defining rural\nspace-filling measurement by information gain, we can construct a new\nurban-rural interaction and coupling model. From this model, we can derive the\nlogistic equation of fractal dimension growth strictly. This indicates that\nurban growth results from the unity of opposites between spatial entropy\nincrease and information increase. In a city, an increase in spatial entropy is\naccompanied by a decrease in urban land availability. An inference is that\nurban growth struggles between the force of urban space-filling and the force\nof urban space-saving. This work presents a set of urban models of spatial\ndynamics, which help us understand urban evolution from the angle of view of\nentropy and fractals.\n", "  We present an open-source retrieval code named HELIOS-Retrieval (hereafter\nHELIOS-R), designed to obtain chemical abundances and temperature-pressure\nprofiles from inverting the measured spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres. In\nthe current implementation, we use an exact solution of the radiative transfer\nequation, in the pure absorption limit, in our forward model, which allows us\nto analytically integrate over all of the outgoing rays (instead of performing\nGaussian quadrature). Two chemistry models are considered: unconstrained\nchemistry (where the mixing ratios are treated as free parameters) and\nequilibrium chemistry (enforced via analytical formulae, where only the\nelemental abundances are free parameters). The nested sampling algorithm allows\nus to formally implement Occam's Razor based on a comparison of the Bayesian\nevidence between models. We perform a retrieval analysis on the measured\nspectra of the HR 8799b, c, d and e directly imaged exoplanets. Chemical\nequilibrium is disfavored by the Bayesian evidence for HR 8799b, c and d. We\nfind supersolar C/O, C/H and O/H values for the outer HR 8799b and c\nexoplanets, while the inner HR 8799d and e exoplanets have substellar C/O,\nsubstellar C/H and superstellar O/H values. If these retrieved properties are\nrepresentative of the bulk compositions of the exoplanets, then they are\ninconsistent with formation via gravitational instability (without late-time\naccretion) and consistent with a core accretion scenario in which late-time\naccretion of ices occurred differently for the inner and outer exoplanets. For\nHR 8799e, we find that spectroscopy in the K band is crucial for constraining\nC/O and C/H. HELIOS-R is publicly available as part of the Exoclimes Simulation\nPlatform (ESP; www.exoclime.org).\n", "  We present a heuristic derivation of Born's rule and unitary transforms in\nQuantum Mechanics, from a simple set of axioms built upon a physical\nphenomenology of quantization. This approach naturally leads to the usual\nquantum formalism, within a new realistic conceptual framework that is\ndiscussed in details. Physically, the structure of Quantum Mechanics appears as\na result of the interplay between the quantized number of \"modalities\"\naccessible to a quantum system, and the continuum of \"contexts\" that are\nrequired to define these modalities. Mathematically, the Hilbert space\nstructure appears as a consequence of a specific \"extra-contextuality\" of\nmodalities, closely related to the hypothesis of Gleason's theorem, and\nconsistent with its conclusions.\n", "  Our knowledge about the universe has increased tremendously in the last three\ndecades or so --- thanks to the progress in observations --- but our\nunderstanding has improved very little. There are several fundamental questions\nabout our universe for which we have no answers within the current,\noperationally very successful, approach to cosmology. Worse still, we do not\neven know how to address some of these issues within the conventional approach\nto cosmology. This fact suggests that we are missing some important theoretical\ningredients in the overall description of the cosmos. I will argue that these\nissues --- some of which are not fully appreciated or emphasized in the\nliterature --- demand a paradigm shift: We should not think of the universe as\ndescribed by a specific solution to the gravitational field equations; instead,\nit should be treated as a special physical system governed by a different\nmathematical description, rooted in the quantum description of spacetime. I\nwill outline how this can possibly be done.\n", "  Condensed matter systems with flat bands close to the Fermi level generally\nexhibit, due to their very large density of states, extraordinary high critical\nordering temperatures of symmetry breaking orders, such as superconductivity\nand magnetism. Here we show that the critical temperatures follow one of two\nuniversal curves with doping away from a flat band depending on the ordering\nchannel, which completely dictates both the general order competition and the\nphase diagram. Notably, we find that orders in the particle-particle channel\n(superconducting orders) survive decisively further than orders in the\nparticle-hole channel (magnetic or charge orders) because the channels have\nfundamentally different polarizabilities. Thus, even if a magnetic or charge\norder initially dominates, superconducting domes are still likely to exist on\nthe flanks of flat bands. We apply these general results to both the\ntopological surface flat bands of rhombohedral ABC-stacked graphite and to the\nvan Hove singularity of graphene.\n", "  Using large resolution numerical simulations of GK turbulence, spanning an\ninterval ranging from the end of the fluid scales to the electron gyroradius,\nwe study the energy transfers in the perpendicular direction for a\nproton-electron plasma in a slab magnetic geometry. In addition, to aid our\nunderstanding of the nonlinear cascade, we use an idealized test representation\nfor the energy transfers between two scales, mimicking the dynamics of\nturbulence in an infinite inertial range. For GK turbulence, a detailed\nanalysis of nonlinear energy transfers that account for the separation of\nenergy exchanging scales is performed. We show that locality functions\nassociated with the energy cascade across dyadic (i.e. multiple of two)\nseparated scales achieve an asymptotic state, recovering clear values for the\nlocality exponents. We relate these exponents to the energy exchange between\ntwo scales, diagnostics that are less computationally intensive than the\nlocality functions. It is the first time asymptotic locality is shown to exist\nfor GK turbulence and the contributions made by highly non-local interactions,\npreviously reported in the literature, are explained as very local transfers of\nenergy that occur between wavenumbers within the same dyadic signal. The\nresults presented here and their implications are discussed from the\nperspective of previous findings reported in the literature and the idea of\nuniversality of GK turbulence.\n", "  We present the development of the first ultrafast transmission electron\nmicroscope (UTEM) driven by localized photoemission from a field emitter\ncathode. We describe the implementation of the instrument, the photoemitter\nconcept and the quantitative electron beam parameters achieved. Establishing a\nnew source for ultrafast TEM, the G\\\"ottingen UTEM employs nano-localized\nlinear photoemission from a Schottky emitter, which enables operation with\nfreely tunable temporal structure, from continuous wave to femtosecond pulsed\nmode. Using this emission mechanism, we achieve record pulse properties in\nultrafast electron microscopy of 9 {\\AA} focused beam diameter, 200 fs pulse\nduration and 0.6 eV energy width. We illustrate the possibility to conduct\nultrafast imaging, diffraction, holography and spectroscopy with this\ninstrument and also discuss opportunities to harness quantum coherent\ninteractions between intense laser fields and free electron beams.\n", "  We derive a set of modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck (mPNP) equations for ion\ntransport from the variation of the free energy functional which includes the\nmany-body Coulomb correlation in media of variable dielectric coefficient. The\ncorrelation effects are considered through the Debye charging process in which\nthe self energy of an ion is governed by the generalized Debye-H\\\"uckel\nequation. We develop the asymptotic expansions of the self energy taking the\nion radius as the small parameter such that the multiscale model can be solved\nefficiently by numerical methods. It is shown that the variations of the energy\nfunctional give the self-energy-modified PNP equations which satisfy a proper\nweak formulation. We present numerical results from different asymptotic\nexpansions with a semi-implicit conservative numerical method and investigate\nthe effect of the Coulomb correlation.\n", "  We study pattern formation for a variational model displaying competition\nbetween a local term penalizing interfaces and a non-local term favoring\noscillations. By means of a $\\Gamma$--convergence analysis, we show that as the\nparameter J converges to a critical value J c, the minimizers converge to\nperiodic one-dimensional stripes. A similar analysis has been previously\nperformed by other authors for related discrete systems. In that context, a\ncentral point is that each \" angle \" comes with a strictly positive\ncontribution to the energy. Since this is not anymore the case in the\ncontinuous setting, we need to overcome this difficulty by slicing arguments\nand a rigidity result.\n", "  This review presents the state of the art in strain and ripple-induced\neffects on the electronic and optical properties of graphene. It starts by\nproviding the crystallographic description of mechanical deformations, as well\nas the diffraction pattern for different kinds of representative deformation\nfields. Then, the focus turns to the unique elastic properties of graphene, and\nto how strain is produced. Thereafter, various theoretical approaches used to\nstudy the electronic properties of strained graphene are examined, discussing\nthe advantages of each. These approaches provide a platform to describe exotic\nproperties, such as a fractal spectrum related with quasicrystals, a mixed\nDirac-Schr\\\"odinger behavior, emergent gravity, topological insulator states,\nin molecular graphene and other 2D discrete lattices. The physical consequences\nof strain on the optical properties are reviewed next, with a focus on the\nRaman spectrum. At the same time, recent advances to tune the optical\nconductivity of graphene by strain engineering are given, which open new paths\nin device applications. Finally, a brief review of strain effects in\nmultilayered graphene and other promising 2D materials like silicene and\nmaterials based on other group-IV elements, phosphorene, dichalcogenide- and\nmonochalcogenide-monolayers is presented, with a brief discussion of interplays\namong strain, thermal effects, and illumination in the latter material family.\n", "  We studied the finite-size giant magnons in\n$\\text{AdS}_4\\times\\text{CP}^3_{\\beta}$ background using the classical spectral\ncurve constructed in this paper. We computed the finite-size corrections to the\ndispersion relations for the $RP^3$ giant magnons using our twisted algebraic\ncurve based on the method proposed in arXiv:0810.1246, in which the authors\ncomputed the finite-size corrections of giant magnons in\n$\\text{AdS}_4\\times\\text{CP}^3$ by introducing a finite-size resolvent\n$G_{\\text{finite}}(x)$. We obtained exactly the same result as in\narXiv:1106.3686, where a totally different approach was used.\n", "  We study the quantum corrections to the generalized Proca theory via matter\nloops. We consider two types of interactions, linear and nonlinear in the\nvector field. Calculating the one-loop correction to the vector field\npropagator, three- and four-point functions, we show that the non-linear\ninteractions are harmless, although they renormalize the theory. The linear\nmatter-vector field interactions introduce ghost degrees of freedom to the\ngeneralized Proca theory. Treating the theory as an effective theory, we\ncalculate the energy scale up to which the theory remains healthy.\n", "  Considerably different properties emerge in nanomaterials as a result of\nquantum confinement and edge effects. In this study, the electronic and\nmagnetic properties of quasi zero dimensional silicene nanoflakes (SiNFs) are\ninvestigated using first principles calculations. Whilst the zigzag edged\nhexagonal SiNFs exhibit nonmagnetic semiconducting character, the zigzag edged\ntriangular SiNFs are magnetic semiconductors. One effective method of\nharnessing the properties of silicene is hydrogenation owing to its\nreversibility and controllability. From bare SiNFs to half hydrogenated and\nthen to fully hydrogenated, a triangular SiNF experiences a change from\nferrimagnetic to very strong ferromagnetic, and then to non-magnetic.\nNonetheless, a hexagonal SiNF undergoes a transfer from nonmagnetic to very\nstrong ferromagnetic, then to nonmagnetic. The half hydrogenated SiNFs produce\na large spin moment that is directly proportional to the square of the flakes\nsize. It has been revealed that the strong induced spin magnetizations align\nparallel and demonstrates a collective character by large range ferromagnetic\nexchange coupling, giving rise to its potential use in spintronic circuit\ndevices. Spin switch models are offered as an example of one of the potential\napplications of SiNFs in tuning the transport properties by controlling the\nhydrogen coverage.\n", "  The symmetry properties of the dynamical matrix are well described in\nmultiple classic textbooks. This short paper revisits the issue to demonstrate\nalternative form of dynamical matrix which explicitly shows its symmetry and\nreality in common cases.\n", "  One of simplest and most widely used error model in working with quantum\ncircuits is the Pauli Twirling Approximation (PTA). Restricting ourselves to\nanalysis of free dynamics of qubits we show explicitly how application of PTA\nis equivalent to ignoring most of the quantum back action of the system and\ngive a general argument as to why this approximation leads to low logical error\nrates in fault tolerant stabilizer circuits as compared to other quantum\nchannels. We provide numerical evidence that PTA's performance in modeling\nnoise gets worse as number of qubits increase.\n", "  Several recent studies have reported different intrinsic correlations between\nthe AGN mid-IR luminosity ($L_{MIR}$) and the rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity\n($L_{X}$) for luminous quasars. To understand the origin of the difference in\nthe observed $L_{X}-L_{MIR}$ relations, we study a sample of 3,247\nspectroscopically confirmed type 1 AGNs collected from Bo\\\"{o}tes, XMM-COSMOS,\nXMM-XXL-North, and the SDSS quasars in the Swift/XRT footprint spanning over\nfour orders of magnitude in luminosity. We carefully examine how different\nobservational constraints impact the observed $L_{X}-L_{MIR}$ relations,\nincluding the inclusion of X-ray non-detected objects, possible X-ray\nabsorption in type 1 AGNs, X-ray flux limits, and star formation contamination.\nWe find that the primary factor driving the different $L_{X}-L_{MIR}$ relations\nreported in the literature is the X-ray flux limits for different studies. When\ntaking these effects into account, we find that the X-ray luminosity and mid-IR\nluminosity (measured at rest-frame $6\\mu m$, or $L_{6\\mu m}$) of our sample of\ntype 1 AGNs follow a bilinear relation in the log-log plane: $\\log L_X\n=(0.84\\pm0.03)\\times\\log L_{6\\mu m}/10^{45}{\\rm erg\\;s^{-1}} + (44.60\\pm0.01)$\nfor $L_{6\\mu m} < 10^{44.79}{\\rm erg\\;s^{-1}} $, and $\\log L_X =\n(0.40\\pm0.03)\\times\\log L_{6\\mu m}/10^{45}{\\rm erg\\;s^{-1}} +(44.51\\pm0.01)$\nfor $L_{6\\mu m} \\geq 10^{44.79}{\\rm erg\\;s^{-1}} $. This suggests that the\nluminous type 1 quasars have a shallower $L_{X}-L_{MIR}$ correlation than the\napproximately linear relations found in local Seyfert galaxies. This result is\nconsistent with previous studies reporting a luminosity-dependent\n$L_{X}-L_{MIR}$ relation, and implies that assuming a linear $L_{X}-L_{MIR}$\nrelation to infer the neutral gas column density for X-ray absorption might\noverestimate the column densities in luminous quasars.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a generalization of the $S$-duality of\nfour-dimensional quantum electrodynamics ($\\text{QED}_4$) to $\\text{QED}_4$\nwith fractionally charged excitations, the fractional $S$-duality. Such\n$\\text{QED}_4$ can be obtained by gauging the $\\text{U(1)}$ symmetry of a\ntopologically ordered state with fractional charges. When time-reversal\nsymmetry is imposed, the axion angle ($\\theta$) can take a nontrivial but still\ntime-reversal invariant value $\\pi/t^2$ ($t\\in\\mathbb{Z}$). Here, $1/t$\nspecifies the minimal electric charge carried by bulk excitations. Such states\nwith time-reversal and $\\text{U(1)}$ global symmetry (fermion number\nconservation) are fractional topological insulators (FTI). We propose a\ntopological quantum field theory description, which microscopically justifies\nthe fractional $S$-duality. Then, we consider stacking operations (i.e., a\ndirect sum of Hamiltonians) among FTIs. We find that there are two\ntopologically distinct classes of FTIs: type-I and type-II. Type-I\n($t\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\rm odd}$) can be obtained by directly stacking a\nnon-interacting topological insulator and a fractionalized gapped fermionic\nstate with minimal charge $1/t$ and vanishing $\\theta$. But type-II\n($t\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\rm even}$) cannot be realized through any stacking. Finally,\nwe study the Surface Topological Order of fractional topological insulators.\n", "  Motivated by the proposal of topological quantum paramagnet in the diamond\nlattice antiferromagnet NiRh$_2$O$_4$, we propose a minimal model to describe\nthe magnetic interaction and properties of the diamond material with the\nspin-one local moments. Our model includes the first and second neighbor\nHeisenberg interactions as well as a local single-ion spin anisotropy that is\nallowed by the spin-one nature of the local moment and the tetragonal symmetry\nof the system. We point out that there exists a quantum phase transition from a\ntrivial quantum paramagnet when the single-ion spin anisotropy is dominant to\nthe magnetic ordered states when the exchange is dominant. Due to the\nfrustrated spin interaction, the magnetic excitation in the quantum\nparamagnetic state supports extensively degenerate band minima in the spectra.\nAs the system approaches the transition, extensively degenerate bosonic modes\nbecome critical at the criticality, giving rise to unusual magnetic properties.\nOur phase diagram and experimental predictions for different phases provide a\nguildeline for the identification of the ground state for NiRh$_2$O$_4$.\nAlthough our results are fundamentally different from the proposal of\ntopological quantum paramagnet, it represents interesting possibilities for\nspin-one diamond lattice antiferromagnets.\n", "  The violation of Stokes--Einstein (SE) relation $D\\sim (\\eta/T)^{-1}$ between\nthe shear viscosity $\\eta$ and the translational diffusion constant $D$ at\ntemperature $T$ is of great importance for characterizing anomalous dynamics of\nsupercooled water. Determining which time scales play key roles in the SE\nviolation remains elusive without the measurement of $\\eta$. Here we provide\ncomprehensive simulation results of the dynamic properties involving $\\eta$ and\n$D$ in TIP4P/2005 supercooled water. This enabled the thorough identification\nof the appropriate time scales for SE relation $D\\eta/T$. In particular, it is\ndemonstrated that the temperature dependence of various time scales associated\nwith structural relaxation, hydrogen bond breakage, stress relaxation, and\ndynamic heterogeneities can be definitely classified into only two classes.\nThat is, we propose the generalized SE relations that exhibit \"violation\" or\n\"preservation\". The classification depends on the examined time scales that are\ncoupled or decoupled with the diffusion. On the basis of the classification, we\nexplain the physical origins of the violation in terms of the increase in the\nplateau modulus and the nonexponentiality of stress relaxation. This implies\nthat the mechanism of SE violation is attributed to the attained solidity upon\nsupercooling, which is in accord with the growth of non-Gaussianity and\nspatially heterogeneous dynamics.\n", "  The role of permutation gates for universal quantum computing is\ninvestigated. The \\lq magic' of computation is clarified in the permutation\ngates, their eigenstates, the Wootters discrete Wigner function and\nstate-dependent contextuality (following many contributions on this subject). A\nfirst classification of main types of resulting magic states in low dimensions\n$d \\le 9$ is performed.\n", "  High-energy gamma-ray emission from supernova remnants (SNRs) has provided a\nunique perspective for studies of Galactic cosmic-ray acceleration. Tycho's SNR\nis a particularly good target because it is a young, type Ia SNR that is\nwell-studied over a wide range of energies and located in a relatively clean\nenvironment. Since the detection of gamma-ray emission from Tycho's SNR by\nVERITAS and Fermi-LAT, there have been several theoretical models proposed to\nexplain its broadband emission and high-energy morphology. We report on an\nupdate to the gamma-ray measurements of Tycho's SNR with 147 hours of VERITAS\nand 84 months of Fermi-LAT observations, which represents about a factor of two\nincrease in exposure over previously published data. About half of the VERITAS\ndata benefited from a camera upgrade, which has made it possible to extend the\nTeV measurements toward lower energies. The TeV spectral index measured by\nVERITAS is consistent with previous results, but the expanded energy range\nsoftens a straight power-law fit. At energies higher than 400 GeV, the\npower-law index is $2.92 \\pm 0.42_{\\mathrm{stat}} \\pm 0.20_{\\mathrm{sys}}$. It\nis also softer than the spectral index in the GeV energy range, $2.14 \\pm\n0.09_{\\mathrm{stat}} \\pm 0.02_{\\mathrm{sys}}$, measured by this study using\nFermi--LAT data. The centroid position of the gamma-ray emission is coincident\nwith the center of the remnant, as well as with the centroid measurement of\nFermi--LAT above 1 GeV. The results are consistent with an SNR shell origin of\nthe emission, as many models assume. The updated spectrum points to a lower\nmaximum particle energy than has been suggested previously.\n", "  We discuss properties of the \"beamsplitter addition\" operation, which\nprovides a non-standard scaled convolution of random variables supported on the\nnon-negative integers. We give a simple expression for the action of\nbeamsplitter addition using generating functions. We use this to give a\nself-contained and purely classical proof of a heat equation and de Bruijn\nidentity, satisfied when one of the variables is geometric.\n", "  In this paper, we study the non commutative quantum dynamics of the spinorial\nfield in the presence of a gravitational background within DeWitt's approach.\nBy employing the vierbein formalism in the temporal state of non commutative\nfour-dimensional space time, we also analyze the first level correction of the\nsolution and Green's function in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor. The\neffect of the gravitational background is imposed at least up to the first\norder of the Riemann curvature tensor.\n", "  In shift-symmetric Horndeski theories, a static and spherically symmetric\nblack hole can support linearly time-dependent scalar hair. However, it was\nshown that such a solution generically suffers from ghost or gradient\ninstability in the vicinity of the horizon. In the present paper, we explore\nthe possibility to avoid the instability, and present a new example of theory\nand its black hole solution with a linearly time-dependent scalar\nconfiguration. We also discuss the stability of solutions with static scalar\nhair for a special case where nonminimal derivative coupling to the Einstein\ntensor appears.\n", "  We present the first world-wide inter-laboratory comparison of small-angle\nX-ray scattering (SAXS) for nanoparticle sizing. The measurands in this\ncomparison are the mean particle radius, the width of the size distribution and\nthe particle concentration. The investigated sample consists of dispersed\nsilver nanoparticles, surrounded by a stabilizing polymeric shell of\npoly(acrylic acid). The silver cores dominate the X-ray scattering pattern,\nleading to the determination of their radii size distribution using: i)\nGlatter's Indirect Fourier Transformation method, ii) classical model fitting\nusing SASfit and iii) a Monte Carlo fitting approach using McSAS. The\napplication of these three methods to the collected datasets produces\nconsistent mean number- and volume-weighted core radii of R$_n$ = 2.76 nm and\nR$_v$ = 3.20 nm, respectively. The corresponding widths of the log-normal radii\ndistribution of the particles were $\\sigma_n$ = 0.65 nm and $\\sigma_v$ = 0.71\nnm. The particle concentration determined using this method was 3.00 $\\pm$ 0.38\ng/L (4.20 $\\pm$ 0.73 $\\times$ 10$^{-6}$ mol/L). We show that the results are\nslightly biased by the choice of data evaluation procedure, but that no\nsubstantial differences were found between the results from data measured on a\nvery wide range of instruments: the participating laboratories at synchrotron\nSAXS beamlines, commercial and home-made instruments were all able to provide\ndata of high quality. Our results demonstrate that SAXS is a qualified method\nfor revealing particle size distributions in the sub-20 nm region (at least),\nout of reach for most other analytical methods.\n", "  We provide a systematic comparison of the many-body localization transition\nin spin chains with nonrandom quasiperiodic vs. random fields. We find evidence\nthat these belong to two separate universality classes: one dominated by\n\"intrinsic\" intra-sample randomness, and the second dominated by external\ninter-sample quenched randomness. We show that the effects of inter-sample\nvariations are strongly growing, but not yet dominant, at the system sizes\nprobed by exact-diagonalization studies on random models. Thus, the observed\nfinite-size critical scaling collapses in such studies appear to be in a\npreasymptotic regime near the nonrandom universality class, but showing signs\nof the initial crossover towards the quenched-disorder dominated universality\nclass. We also show that the MBL phase is more stable for the quasiperiodic\nmodel as compared to the random one, and the transition in the quasiperiodic\nmodel suffers less from certain finite-size effects. Altogether, our results\nmotivate the need for a greater focus on quasiperiodic models in theoretical\nstudies of the MBL transition.\n", "  Noncommutative spacetimes are widely believed to model some properties of the\nquantum structure of spacetime at the Planck regime. In this contribution the\nconstruction of (anti-)de Sitter noncommutative spacetimes obtained through\nquantum groups is reviewed. In this approach the quantum deformation parameter\n$z$ is related to a Planck scale, and the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ plays\nthe role of a second deformation parameter of geometric nature, whose limit\n$\\Lambda\\to 0$ provides the corresponding noncommutative Minkowski spacetimes.\n", "  I describe an approach which relates classical gravity to the quantum\nmicrostructure of spacetime. In this approach, the field equations arise from\nmaximizing the density of states of the matter plus geometry. The former is\nidentified using the thermodynamics of null surfaces. The latter arises from\nthe existence of a zero-point length in the spacetime which associates an\ninternal degree of freedom with each event in the spacetime, in the form of a\nfluctuating vector of constant norm. The density of states, as well as the\nresulting gravitational field equations, remain invariant when a constant is\nadded to the matter Lagrangian, which is a symmetry of the matter sector. The\ncosmological constant arises as an integration constant and renders the amount\nof cosmic information accessible to an eternal observer finite. The relation\nbetween the cosmological constant and the cosmic information allows us to\ndetermine the numerical value of cosmological constant from the information\ncontent of the quantum spacetime, within the context of cosmology.\n", "  We show that $\\frak{su}(2)$ Lie algebras of coordinate operators related to\nquantum spaces with $\\frak{su}(2)$ noncommutativity can be conveniently\nrepresented by $SO(3)$-covariant poly-differential involutive representations.\nWe show that the quantized plane waves obtained from the quantization map\naction on the usual exponential functions are determined by polar decomposition\nof operators combined with constraint stemming from the Wigner theorem for\n$SU(2)$. Selecting a subfamily of $^*$-representations, we show that the\nresulting star-product is equivalent to the Kontsevich product for the Poisson\nmanifold dual to the finite dimensional Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$. We\ndiscuss the results, indicating a way to extend the construction to any\nsemi-simple non simply connected Lie group and present noncommutative scalar\nfield theories which are free from perturbative UV/IR mixing.\n", "  The energy efficiency and power of a three-terminal thermoelectric nanodevice\nare studied by considering elastic tunneling through a single quantum dot.\nFacilitated by the three-terminal geometry, the nanodevice is able to generate\nsimultaneously two electrical powers by utilizing only one temperature bias.\nThese two electrical powers can add up constructively or destructively,\ndepending on their signs. It is demonstrated that the constructive addition\nleads to the enhancement of both energy efficiency and output power for various\nsystem parameters. In fact, such enhancement, dubbed as thermoelectric\ncooperative effect, can lead to maximum efficiency and power no less than when\nonly one of the electrical power is harvested.\n", "  We study the unidirectional transport of two-particle quantum wavepackets in\na regular one-dimensional lattice. We show that the bound-pair state component\nbehaves differently from unbound states when subjected to an external pulsed\nelectric field. Thus, strongly entangled particles exhibit a quite distinct\ndynamics when compared to a single particle system. With respect to centroid\nmotion, our numerical results are corroborated with an analytical expression\nobtained using a semi-classical approach. The wavefunction profile reveals that\nthe particle-particle interaction induces the splitting of the initial\nwavepacket into two branches that propagate with specific directions and drift\nvelocities. With a proper external field tunning, the wavepacket components can\nperform an unidirectional transport on the same or opposite directions. The\namplitude of each mode is related to the degree of entanglement betweem\nparticles, which presents a non-monotonic dependence on the interaction\nstrength.\n", "  The broadband and ultrafast photoresponse of graphene has been extensively\nstudied in recent years, although the photoexcited carrier dynamics is still\nfar from being completely understood. Different experimental approaches imply\neither one of two fundamentally different scattering mechanisms for hot\nelectrons. One is high-energy optical phonons, while the other is\ndisorder-driven supercollisions with acoustic phonons. However, the concurrent\nrelaxation via both optical and acoustic phonons has not been considered so\nfar, hindering the interpretation of different experiments within a unified\nframework. Here we expand the optical phonon-mediated cooling model, to include\nelectron scattering with the acoustic phonons. By assuming the enhancement of\nelectron-acoustic phonon supercollisions from the localized defect at the\nphotothermoelectric current-generating interface, we provide a broader\nperspective to the ultrafast photoresponse of graphene, highlighting the\npreviously overlooked effect of the interface for cooling dynamics. We show\nthat the transient photothermoelectric response, which has been attributed\nexclusively to supercollisions, can be successfully explained without rejecting\nthe established optical phonon relaxation pathway, demonstrating that the two\ncooling mechanisms are not mutually exclusive but complement each other.\n", "  We investigate real- and lattice-spin currents controlled by strain in a\nsilicene-based junction, where chemical potential, perpendicular electric field\nand circularly polarized light are applied into the strained barrier. We find\nthat the junction yields strain filtering effect with perfect strain control of\nreal- (or lattice-) spin currents. (i) By applying electric field without\ncircularly polarized light we show that total current is carried by pure\nlattice-spin up (or down) electrons tunable by strain. (ii) When circularly\npolarized light is irradiated onto silicene sheet without applying electric\nfield, total current is carried by pure real-spin up (or down) electrons\ntunable by strain. High conductance peaks associated with pure real-(or\nlattice-) spin currents in case ii(or i) occur at specific magnitude of strain,\nyielding strain filtering effect. Magnitudes of filtered strain due to pure\nreal- (or lattice-) spin currents may be tunable by varying chemical potential.\nSensitivity may be enhanced by increasing thickness of strained barrier.\nSignificantly, (iii) when both perpendicular electric field and circularly\npolarized light are applied, the total current is carried by three species of\nelectron groups tunable by strain. This may lead to controllable numbers of\nelectron species to transport. This result shows that strain filtering effect\nin a silicene-based junction is quite different from that in graphene junction.\nOur work reveals potential of silicene as a nano-electro-mechanical device and\nspin-valleytronic applications.\n", "  Projected Hartree-Fock theory provides an accurate description of many kinds\nof strong correlation but does not properly describe weakly correlated systems.\nCoupled cluster theory, in contrast, does the opposite. It therefore seems\nnatural to combine the two so as to describe both strong and weak correlations\nwith high accuracy in a relatively black-box manner. Combining the two\napproaches, however, is made more difficult by the fact that the two techniques\nare formulated very differently. In earlier work, we showed how to write\nspin-projected Hartree-Fock in a coupled-cluster-like language. Here, we fill\nin the gaps in that earlier work. Further, we combine projected Hartree-Fock\nand coupled cluster theory in a variational formulation and show how the\ncombination performs for the description of the Hubbard Hamiltonian and for\nseveral small molecular systems.\n", "  Entanglement is one of the most fascinating properties of quantum mechanical\nsystems; when two particles are entangled the measurement of the properties of\none of the two allows to instantaneously know the properties of the other,\nwhatever the distance separating them. In parallel with fundamental research on\nthe foundations of quantum mechanics performed on complex experimental set-ups,\nwe assist today to a bourgeoning of quantum information technologies bound to\nexploit entanglement for a large variety of applications such as secure\ncommunications, metrology and computation. Among the different physical systems\nunder investigation, those involving photonic components are likely to play a\ncentral role and in this context semiconductor materials exhibit a huge\npotential in terms of integration of several quantum components in miniature\nchips. In this article we review the recent progress in the development of\nsemiconductor devices emitting entangled photons. We will present the physical\nprocesses allowing to generate entanglement and the tools to characterize it;\nwe will give an overview of major recent results of the last years and\nhighlight perspectives for future developments.\n", "  Confined to a two-dimensional plane, electrons in a strong magnetic field\ntravel along the edge in one-dimensional quantum Hall channels that are\nprotected against backscattering. These channels can be used as solid-state\nanalogues of monochromatic beams of light, providing a unique platform for\nstudying electron interference. Electron interferometry is regarded as one of\nthe most promising routes for studying fractional and non-Abelian statistics\nand quantum entanglement via two-particle interference. However, creating an\nedge-channel interferometer in which electron-electron interactions play an\nimportant role requires a clean system and long phase coherence lengths. Here\nwe realize electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometers with record visibilities of\nup to 98% using spin- and valley-polarized edge channels that co-propagate\nalong a PN junction in graphene. We find that inter-channel scattering between\nsame-spin edge channels along the physical graphene edge can be used to form\nbeamsplitters, while the absence of inter-channel scattering along gate-defined\ninterfaces can be used to form isolated interferometer arms. Surprisingly, our\ninterferometer is robust to dephasing effects at energies an order of magnitude\nlarger than observed in pioneering experiments on GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells.\nOur results shed light on the nature of edge-channel equilibration and open up\nnew possibilities for studying exotic electron statistics and quantum\nphenomena.\n", "  In this paper, the calorimetric power measurement method for electron\ncyclotron resonance heating system on EAST are presented. This method requires\nmeasurement of the water flow through the cooling circuits and the input and\noutput water temperatures in each cooling circuit. Usually, the inlet water\ntemperature is controlled to be stable to get more accurate results. The\ninfluence of the inlet water temperature change on the measurement results is\nanalyzed for the first time in this paper. A novel temperature calibration\nmethod is proposed also. This kind of calibration method is accurate and\neffective, and can be easily implemented.\n", "  We employ quantum kinetic theory to investigate local quantum physics in the\nbackground of spherically symmetric and neutral black holes formed through the\ngravitational collapse. For this purpose in mind, we derive and study the\ncovariant Wigner distribution function $\\mathcal{W}(x,p)$ near to and far away\nfrom the black-hole horizon. We find that the local density of the particle\nnumber is negative in the near-horizon region, while the entropy density is\nimaginary. These pose a question whether kinetic theory is applicable in the\nnear-horizon region. We elaborate on that and propose a possible interpretation\nof how this result might nevertheless be self-consistently understood.\n", "  Motivated by the recent proposal of the spinon Fermi surface spin liquids for\nseveral candidate materials such as YbMgGaO4, we explore the experimental\nconsequences of the external magnetic fields on this exotic state.\nSpecifically, we focus on the weak field regime where the spin liquid state is\nwell preserved and the spinon remain to be a good description of the magnetic\nexcitations. From the spin-1/2 nature of the spinon excitation, we predict the\nunique features of the spinon continuum when the weak magnetic field is applied\nto the system. Due to the small energy scale of the exchange interactions\nbetween the local moments in the spin liquid candidate like YbMgGaO4, our\nproposal for the spectral weight shifts and spectral crossing in the magnetic\nfields can be immediately tested by inelastic neutron scattering experiments.\nSeveral other experimental aspects about the spinon Fermi surface and the\nspinon excitations are discussed and proposed. Our work provides an\nexperimental scheme to examine the fractionalized spinon excitation and the\ncandidate spin liquid states in YbMgGaO4, the 6H-B phase of Ba3NiSb2O9 and\nother relevant materials.\n", "  The failures of single-reference coupled cluster for strongly correlated\nmany-body systems is flagged at the mean-field level by the spontaneous\nbreaking of one or more physical symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Restoring the\nsymmetry of the mean-field determinant by projection reveals that coupled\ncluster fails because it factorizes high-order excitation amplitudes\nincorrectly. However, symmetry-projected mean-field wave functions do not\naccount sufficiently for dynamic (or weak) correlation. Here we pursue a merger\nof symmetry projection and coupled cluster theory, following previous work\nalong these lines that utilized the simple Lipkin model system as a testbed [J.\nChem. Phys. 146, 054110 (2017)]. We generalize the concept of a\nsymmetry-projected mean-field wave function to the concept of a symmetry\nprojected state, in which the factorization of high-order excitation amplitudes\nin terms of low-order ones is guided by symmetry projection and is not\nexponential, and combine them with coupled cluster theory in order to model the\nground state of the Agassi Hamiltonian. This model has two separate channels of\ncorrelation and two separate physical symmetries which are broken under strong\ncorrelation. We show how the combination of symmetry collective states and\ncoupled cluster is effective in obtaining correlation energies and order\nparameters of the Agassi model throughout its phase diagram.\n", "  We investigate the role of Hund's coupling in the spin-wave excitations of\nthe ($\\pi, 0$) ordered magnetic state within a five-orbital tight-binding model\nfor iron pnictides. To differentiate between the roles of intraorbital Coulomb\ninteraction and Hund's coupling, we focus on the self-consistently obtained\nmean-field SDW state with a fixed magnetic moment obtained by using different\nsets of interaction parameters. We find that the Hund's coupling is crucial for\nthe description of various experimentally observed characteristics of the\nspin-wave excitations including the anisotropy, energy-dependent behavior, and\nspin-wave spectral weight distribution.\n", "  The Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) is a powerful framework for\nstudying factorization of amplitudes and cross sections in QCD. While\nfactorization at leading power has been well studied, much less is known at\nsubleading powers in the $\\lambda\\ll 1$ expansion. In SCET subleading soft and\ncollinear corrections to a hard scattering process are described by power\nsuppressed operators, which must be fixed case by case, and by well established\npower suppressed Lagrangians, which correct the leading power dynamics of soft\nand collinear radiation. Here we present a complete basis of power suppressed\noperators for $gg \\to H$, classifying all operators which contribute to the\ncross section at $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^2)$, and showing how helicity selection\nrules significantly simplify the construction of the operator basis. We perform\nmatching calculations to determine the tree level Wilson coefficients of our\noperators. These results are useful for studies of power corrections in both\nresummed and fixed order perturbation theory, and for understanding the\nfactorization properties of gauge theory amplitudes and cross sections at\nsubleading power. As one example, our basis of operators can be used to\nanalytically compute power corrections for $N$-jettiness subtractions for $gg$\ninduced color singlet production at the LHC.\n", "  AX J1745.6-2901 is an X-ray binary located at only 1.45 arcmin from Sgr A*,\nshowcasing a strong X-ray dust scattering halo. We combine Chandra and\nXMM-Newton observations to study the halo around this X-ray binary. Our study\nshows two major thick dust layers along the line of sight (LOS) towards AX\nJ1745.6-2901. The LOS position and $N_{H}$ of these two layers depend on the\ndust grain models with different grain size distribution and abundances. But\nfor all the 19 dust grain models considered, dust Layer-1 is consistently found\nto be within a fractional distance of 0.11 (mean value: 0.05) to AX\nJ1745.6-2901 and contains only (19-34)% (mean value: 26%) of the total LOS\ndust. The remaining dust is contained in Layer-2, which is distributed from the\nEarth up to a mean fractional distance of 0.64. A significant separation\nbetween the two layers is found for all the dust grain models, with a mean\nfractional distance of 0.31. Besides, an extended wing component is discovered\nin the halo, which implies a higher fraction of dust grains with typical sizes\n$\\lesssim$ 590 \\AA\\ than considered in current dust grain models. Assuming AX\nJ1745.6-2901 is 8 kpc away, dust Layer-2 would be located in the Galactic disk\nseveral kpc away from the Galactic Centre (GC). The dust scattering halo biases\nthe observed spectrum of AX J1745.6-2901 severely in both spectral shape and\nflux, and also introduces a strong dependence on the size of the instrumental\npoint spread function and the source extraction region. We build Xspec models\nto account for this spectral bias, which allow us to recover the intrinsic\nspectrum of AX J1745.6-2901 free from dust scattering opacity. If dust Layer-2\nalso intervenes along the LOS to Sgr A* and other nearby GC sources, a\nsignificant spectral correction for the dust scattering opacity would be\nnecessary for all these GC sources.\n", "  We investigate cosmic string networks in the Abelian Higgs model using data\nfrom a campaign of large-scale numerical simulations on lattices of up to\n$4096^3$ grid points. We observe scaling or self-similarity of the networks\nover a wide range of scales, and estimate the asymptotic values of the mean\nstring separation in horizon length units $\\dot{\\xi}$ and of the mean square\nstring velocity $\\bar v^2$ in the continuum and large time limits. The scaling\noccurs because the strings lose energy into classical radiation of the scalar\nand gauge fields of the Abelian Higgs model. We quantify the energy loss with a\ndimensionless radiative efficiency parameter, and show that it does not vary\nsignificantly with lattice spacing or string separation. This implies that the\nradiative energy loss underlying the scaling behaviour is not a lattice\nartefact, and justifies the extrapolation of measured network properties to\nlarge times for computations of cosmological perturbations. We also show that\nthe core growth method, which increases the defect core width with time to\nextend the dynamic range of simulations, does not introduce significant\nsystematic error. We compare $\\dot{\\xi}$ and $\\bar v^2$ to values measured in\nsimulations using the Nambu-Goto approximation, finding that the latter\nunderestimate the mean string separation by about 25%, and overestimate $\\bar\nv^2$ by about 10%. The scaling of the string separation implies that string\nloops decay by the emission of massive radiation within a Hubble time in field\ntheory simulations, in contrast to the Nambu-Goto scenario which neglects this\nenergy loss mechanism. String loops surviving for only one Hubble time emit\nmuch less gravitational radiation than in the Nambu-Goto scenario, and are\nconsequently subject to much weaker gravitational wave constraints on their\ntension.\n", "  We investigate the possibility that Dark Matter arises as a composite state\nof a fundamental confining dynamics, together with the Higgs boson. We focus on\nthe minimal SU(4)$\\times$SU(4)/SU(4) model which has both a Dark Matter and a\nHiggs candidates arising as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. At the same time, a\nsimple underlying gauge-fermion theory can be defined providing an existence\nproof of, and useful constraints on, the effective field theory description. We\nfocus on the parameter space where the Dark Matter candidate is mostly a gauge\nsinglet. We present a complete calculation of its relic abundance and find\npreferred masses between 500 GeV to a few TeV. Direct Dark Matter detection\nalready probes part of the parameter space, ruling out masses above 1 TeV,\nwhile Indirect Detection is relevant only if non-thermal production is assumed.\nThe prospects for detection of the odd composite scalars at the LHC are also\nestablished.\n", "  We present a comprehensive 5-43 GHz VLBA study of the blazar 3C 273 initiated\nafter an onset of a strong $\\gamma$-ray flare in this source. We have analyzed\nthe kinematics of new-born components, light curves, and position of the\napparent core to pinpoint the location of the $\\gamma$-ray emission. Estimated\nlocation of the $\\gamma$-ray emission zone is close to the jet apex, 2 pc to 7\npc upstream from the observed 7 mm core. This is supported by ejection of a new\ncomponent. The apparent core position was found to be inversely proportional to\nfrequency. The brightness temperature in the 7 mm core reached values up to at\nleast $10^{13}$ K during the flare. This supports the dominance of particle\nenergy density over that of magnetic field in the 7 mm core. Particle density\nincreased during the radio flare at the apparent jet base, affecting\nsynchrotron opacity. This manifested itself as an apparent core shuttle along\nthe jet during the 7 mm flare. It is also shown that a region where optical\ndepth decreases from $\\tau\\sim1$ to $\\tau<<1$ spans over several parsecs along\nthe jet. The jet bulk flow speed estimated at the level of 12c on the basis of\ntime lags between 7 mm light curves of stationary jet features is 1.5 times\nhigher than that derived from VLBI apparent kinematics analysis.\n", "  We study asymptotic safety of models of the higher derivative quantum gravity\nwith and without matter. The beta functions are derived by utilizing the\nfunctional renormalization group, and non-trivial fixed points are found. It\nturns out that all couplings in gravity sector, namely the cosmological\nconstant, the Newton constant, and the $R^2$ and $R_{\\mu\\nu}^2$ coupling\nconstants, are relevant in case of higher derivative pure gravity. For the\nHiggs-Yukawa model non-minimal coupled with higher derivative gravity, we find\na stable fixed point at which the scalar-quartic and the Yukawa coupling\nconstants become relevant. The relevant Yukawa coupling is crucial to realize\nthe finite value of the Yukawa coupling constants in the standard model.\n", "  If a significant fraction of the dark matter in the Universe is made of an\nultra-light scalar field, named fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with a mass $m_a$ of\nthe order of $10^{-22}-10^{-21}$ eV, then its de Broglie wavelength is large\nenough to impact the physics of large scale structure formation. In particular,\nthe associated cut-off in the linear matter power spectrum modifies the\nstructure of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the scales probed by the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest of distant quasars. We study this effect by making use of\ndedicated cosmological simulations which take into account the hydrodynamics of\nthe IGM. We explore heuristically the amplitude of quantum pressure for the FDM\nmasses considered here and conclude that quantum effects should not modify\nsignificantly the non-linear evolution of matter density at the scales relevant\nto the measured Lyman-$\\alpha$ flux power, and for $m_a \\geq 10^{-22}$ eV. We\nderive a scaling law between $m_a$ and the mass of the well-studied thermal\nwarm dark matter (WDM) model that is best adapted to the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest\ndata, and differs significantly from the one infered by a simple linear\nextrapolation. By comparing FDM simulations with the Lyman-$\\alpha$ flux power\nspectra determined from the BOSS survey, and marginalizing over relevant\nnuisance parameters, we exclude FDM masses in the range $10^{-22} \\leq m_a <\n2.3\\times 10^{-21}$ eV at 95 % CL. Adding higher-resolution Lyman-$\\alpha$\nspectra extends the exclusion range up to $2.9\\times 10^{-21}$ eV. This\nprovides a significant constraint on FDM models tailored to solve the\n\"small-scale problems\" of $\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments, we present here an ab initio study of the\nimpact of the phonon transport on the thermal conductance and thermoelectric\nfigure of merit of C$_{60}$-based single-molecule junctions. To be precise, we\ncombine density functional theory with nonequilibrium Green's function\ntechniques to compute these two quantities in junctions with either a C$_{60}$\nmonomer or a C$_{60}$ dimer connected to gold electrodes, taking into account\nthe contributions of both electrons and phonons. Our results show that for\nC$_{60}$ monomer junctions phonon transport plays a minor role in the thermal\nconductance and, in turn, in the figure of merit, which can reach relatively\nhigh values on the order of 0.1, depending on the contact geometry. At the\ncontrary, phonons completely dominate the thermal conductance in C$_{60}$ dimer\njunctions and strongly reduce the figure of merit as compared to monomer\njunctions. Thus, claims that by stacking C$_{60}$ molecules one could achieve\nhigh thermoelectric performance, which have been made without considering the\nphonon contribution, are not justified. Moreover, we analyze the relevance of\nnear-field thermal radiation for the figure of merit of these junctions within\nthe framework of fluctuational electrodynamics. We conclude that photon\ntunneling can be another detrimental factor for the thermoelectric performance,\nwhich has been overlooked so far in the field of molecular electronics. Our\nstudy illustrates the crucial roles that phonon transport and photon tunneling\ncan play when critically assessing the performance of molecular junctions as\npotential nanoscale thermoelectric devices.\n", "  The $D \\bar{D}^*$ interaction via a $\\pi \\psi$ intermediate state is studied\ncarefully in the isospin $I=1$ sector. By solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nin the unitary coupled-channel approximation, we obtain the S-wave amplitude as\na function of the total energy of the system in the center of mass frame. A\nresonance state is generated dynamically in the 3900MeV region, which might\ncorrespond to the $Zc(3900)$ particle. Moreover, the loop function of a vector\nmeson and a pseudoscalar meson is deduced explicitly in the dimensional\nregularization scheme and the contribution of the longitudinal part of the\nvector meson propagator is taken into account. The initial and final\npolarization vectors in the vertex of the vector meson and the pseudoscalar\nmeson are eliminated when the Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved, and it is\ncertified that the amplitude is still unitary in the calculation.\n", "  In the wake of intense research on metamaterials the two-dimensional\nanalogue, known as metasurfaces, has attracted progressively increasing\nattention in recent years due to the ease of fabrication and smaller insertion\nlosses, while enabling an unprecedented control over spatial distributions of\ntransmitted and reflected optical fields. Metasurfaces represent optically thin\nplanar arrays of resonant subwavelength elements that can be arranged in a\nstrictly or quasi periodic fashion, or even in an aperiodic manner, depending\non targeted optical wavefronts to be molded with their help. This paper reviews\na broad subclass of metasurfaces, viz. gradient metasurfaces, which are devised\nto exhibit spatially varying optical responses resulting in spatially varying\namplitudes, phases and polarizations of scattered fields. Starting with\nintroducing the concept of gradient metasurfaces, we present classification of\ndifferent metasurfaces from the viewpoint of their responses, differentiating\nelectrical-dipole, geometric, reflective and Huygens' metasurfaces. The\nfundamental building blocks essential for the realization of metasurfaces are\nthen discussed in order to elucidate the underlying physics of various physical\nrealizations of both plasmonic and purely dielectric metasurfaces. We then\noverview the main applications of gradient metasurfaces, including waveplates,\nflat lenses, spiral phase plates, broadband absorbers, color printing,\nholograms, polarimeters and surface wave couplers. The review is terminated\nwith a short section on recently developed nonlinear metasurfaces, followed by\nthe outlook presenting our view on possible future developments and\nperspectives for future applications.\n", "  We present a model that explains why galaxies form stars on a time scale\nsignificantly longer than the time scales of processes governing the evolution\nof interstellar gas. We show that gas evolves from a non-star-forming to a\nstar-forming state on a relatively short time scale and thus the rate of this\nevolution does not limit the star formation rate. Instead, the star formation\nrate is limited because only a small fraction of star-forming gas is converted\ninto stars before star-forming regions are dispersed by feedback and dynamical\nprocesses. Thus, gas cycles into and out of star-forming state multiple times,\nwhich results in a long time scale on which galaxies convert gas into stars.\nOur model does not rely on the assumption of equilibrium and can be used to\ninterpret trends of depletion times with the properties of observed galaxies\nand the parameters of star formation and feedback recipes in simulations. In\nparticular, the model explains how feedback self-regulates the star formation\nrate in simulations and makes it insensitive to the local star formation\nefficiency. We illustrate our model using the results of an isolated\n$L_*$-sized galaxy simulation that reproduces the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt\nrelation for both molecular and atomic gas. Interestingly, the relation for\nmolecular gas is almost linear on kiloparsec scales, although a nonlinear\nrelation is adopted in simulation cells. We discuss how a linear relation\nemerges from non-self-similar scaling of the gas density PDF with the average\ngas surface density.\n", "  We perform MHD simulations in full GR of uniformly rotating stars that are\nmarginally unstable to collapse. Our simulations model the direct collapse of\nsupermassive stars (SMSs) to seed black holes (BHs) that can grow to become the\nsupermassive BHs at the centers of quasars and AGNs. They also crudely model\nthe collapse of massive Pop III stars to BHs, which could power a fraction of\ndistant, long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The initial stellar models we adopt are\n$\\Gamma = 4/3$ polytropes seeded with a dynamically unimportant dipole magnetic\nfield (B field). We treat initial B-field configurations either confined to the\nstellar interior or extending out from the interior into the stellar exterior.\nThe BH formed following collapse has mass $M_{BH} \\simeq 0.9M$ (where $M$ is\nthe mass of the initial star) and spin $a_{BH}/M_{BH}\\simeq 0.7$. A massive,\nhot, magnetized torus surrounds the remnant BH. At $\\Delta t\\sim\n400-550M\\approx 2000-2700(M/10^6M_\\odot)$s following the gravitational wave\n(GW) peak amplitude, an incipient jet is launched. The disk lifetime is $\\Delta\nt\\sim 10^5(M/10^6M_\\odot)$s, and the jet luminosity is $L_{EM}\\sim 10^{51-52}$\nergs/s. If $\\gtrsim 1-10\\%$ of this power is converted into gamma rays, SWIFT\nand FERMI could potentially detect these events out to large redshifts $z\\sim\n20$. Thus, SMSs could be sources of ultra-long GRBs and massive Pop III stars\ncould be the progenitors that power a fraction of the long GRBs observed at\nredshift $z \\sim 5-8$. GWs are copiously emitted during the collapse, and peak\nat $\\sim 15(10^6 M_{\\odot}/M)\\rm mHz$ ($\\sim 0.15(10^4 M_{\\odot}/M)\\rm Hz$),\ni.e., in the LISA (DECIGO/BBO) band; optimally oriented SMSs could be\ndetectable by LISA (DECIGO/BBO) at $z \\lesssim 3$ ($z \\lesssim 11$). Hence\n$10^4 M_{\\odot}$ SMSs collapsing at $z\\sim 10$ are promising multimessenger\nsources of coincident gravitational and electromagnetic waves.\n", "  We discuss black hole solutions of Einstein gravity in presence of nonlinear\nelectrodynamics in dS spacetime. Considering prescribed entropy, thermodynamic\nvolume of dS spacetime, We investigate properties of the effective\nthermodynamic quantities under influence of nonlinearity parameter $\\alpha$.\nThey show a similar phase transition and criticality properties with that of\nblack holes in AdS spacetime. And the nonlinearity parameter $\\alpha$ combined\nwith electric charge is found to have effects on the phase structure. By the\nEhrenfest equations we prove the critical phase transition is a second order\nequilibrium transition.\n", "  This letter calculates the exact fundamental limits of the first ({\\beta})\nand second ({\\gamma}) hyperpolarizabilities using Monte-Carlo sampling of\nenergy spectra and transition moments constrained by the diagonal\nThomas-Reiche-Kuhn (TRK) sum rules and filtered by the off-diagonal TRK sum\nrules. The upper bounds of {\\beta} and {\\gamma} are determined from these\nquantities by applying error-refined extrapolation to perfect compliance to the\nsum rules. The method yields the largest diagonal component of the\nhyperpolarizabilities for an arbitrary number of interacting electrons in any\nnumber of dimensions without the necessity for exotic interactions or\nunconventional spectra. The results show that the fundamental limits agree with\nthose achieved by potential optimization and direct solution of mechanical\nHamiltonians, about 30% (40%) below original estimates of the limits for\n{\\beta} ({\\gamma}), and show that the special cases that lead to divergent\nnonlinearities in the many-state catastrophe are not physically realizable.\nThus, this letter shows for the first time that the fundamental limits are\nrigorously exact and are achievable without exotic material designs.\n", "  The coherence times achieved with continuous dynamical decoupling techniques\nare often limited by fluctuations in the driving amplitude. In this work, we\nuse time-dependent phase-modulated continuous driving to increase the\nrobustness against such fluctuations in a dense ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy\ncenters in diamond. Considering realistic experimental errors in the system, we\nidentify the optimal modulation strength, and demonstrate an improvement of an\norder of magnitude in the spin-preservation of arbitrary states over\nconventional single continuous driving. The phase-modulated driving exhibits\ncomparable results to previously examined amplitude-modulated techniques, and\nis expected to outperform them in experimental systems having higher phase\naccuracy. The proposed technique could open new avenues for quantum information\nprocessing and many body physics, in systems dominated by high frequency\nspin-bath noise, for which pulsed dynamical decoupling is less effective.\n", "  The reduction of the \\emph{K2}'s Campaign 9 (K2C9) microlensing data is\nchallenging mostly because of the very crowded field and the unstable pointing\nof the spacecraft. In this work, we present the first method that can extract\nmicrolensing signals from this K2C9 data product. The raw light curves and the\nastrometric solutions are first derived, using the techniques from\nSoares-Furtado et al. and Huang et al. for \\emph{K2} dense field photometry. We\nthen minimize and remove the systematic effect by performing simultaneous\nmodeling with the microlensing signal. We also derive precise $(K_p-I)$ vs.\n$(V-I)$ color-color relations that can predict the microlensing source flux in\nthe \\emph{Kepler} bandpass. By implementing the color-color relation in the\nlight curve modeling, we show that the microlensing parameters can be better\nconstrained. In the end, we use two example microlensing events,\nOGLE-2016-BLG-0980 and OGLE-2016-BLG-0940, to test our method.\n", "  We study systems made of periodic arrays of one dimensional quantum wires,\ncoupled by Coulomb interaction. Using bosonization an interacting metallic\nfixed point is obtained, which is shown to be a higher dimensional analogue of\nthe Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, or a sliding Luttinger liquid. This non-Fermi\nliquid metallic state, however, is unstable in the presence of weak interwire\nbackscatterings, which favor charge density wave states and suppress pairing.\nDepending on the effective strength of the Coulomb repulsion and the size of\ninterwire spacing various charge density wave states are stabilized, including\nWigner crystal states. Our method allows for the determination of the specific\nordering patterns, and corresponding energy and temperature scales.\n", "  Integrable models provide an exact description for a wide variety of physical\nphenomena. For example nested integrable systems contain different species of\ninteracting particles with a rich phenomenology in their collective behavior,\nwhich is the origin of the unconventional phenomenon of spin-charge separation.\nSo far, however, most of the theoretical work in the study of non-equilibrium\ndynamics of integrable systems has been focusing on models with an elementary\n(i.e., not nested) Bethe ansatz. In this work we explicitly investigate quantum\nquenches in nested integrable systems, by generalizing the application of the\nQuench Action approach. Specifically, we consider the spin-$1$ Lai-Sutherland\nmodel, described, in the thermodynamic limit, by the theory of two different\nspecies of Bethe-ansatz particles, each one forming an infinite number of bound\nstates. We focus on the situation where the quench dynamics starts from a\nsimple matrix product state for which the overlaps with the eigenstates of the\nHamiltonian are known. We fully characterize the post-quench steady state and\nperform several consistency checks for the validity of our results. Finally, we\nprovide predictions for the propagation of entanglement and mutual information\nafter the quench, which can be used as signature of the quasi-particle content\nof the model.\n", "  We realise a feedback-controlled optical Fabry-Perot cavity in which the\ntransmitted cavity output is used to modulate the input amplitude fluctuations.\nThe resulting phase-dependent fluctuations of the in-loop optical field, which\nmay be either sub-shot- or super-shot-noise, can be engineered to favorably\naffect the optomechanical interaction with a nanomechanical membrane placed\nwithin the cavity. Here we show that in the super-shot-noise regime\n(\"anti-squashed light\") the in-loop field has a strongly reduced effective\ncavity linewidth, corresponding to an increased optomechanical cooperativity.\nIn this regime feedback improves the simultaneous resolved sideband cooling of\ntwo nearly degenerate membrane mechanical modes by one order of magnitude.\n", "  We report on growth and characterization of individual InAsP/GaInP quantum\ndots with variable nominal As molar fraction. Magneto-photoluminescence\nexperiments reveal QD emission in a wide range from 1.3 to 1.8 eV confirming\nincorporation of As into quantum dots. Transmission electron microscopy reveals\na core-cap structure of InAsP quantum dots with an InAs-rich core capped by an\nInP-rich layer. Inside the core, an As molar fraction up to x=0.12 is observed.\nThe heavy hole g-factor is found to be strongly dependent on As molar fraction,\nwhile the electron g-factor is close to the InP values. This suggests type-II\ncarrier confinement in the studied InAsP dots with holes (electrons) localized\nin the core (cap) region. Finally, dynamic nuclear polarization is observed\nwhich allows for further insight into structural properties using nuclear\nmagnetic resonance.\n", "  The Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) provides scale-fixed perturbative\nQCD predictions which are independent of the choice of the renormalization\nscheme, as well as the choice of the initial renormalization scale. In this\narticle, we will test the PMC by comparing its predictions for the strong\ncoupling \\alpha^s_{g_1}(Q), defined from the Bjorken sum rule, with predictions\nusing conventional pQCD scale-setting. The two results are found to be\ncompatible with each other and with the available experimental data. However,\nthe PMC provides a significantly more precise determination, although its\ndomain of applicability (Q \\gtrsim 1.5 GeV) does not extend to as small values\nof momentum transfer as that of a conventional pQCD analysis (Q \\gtrsim 1 GeV).\nWe suggest that the PMC range of applicability could be improved by a modified\nintermediate scheme choice or using a single effective PMC scale.\n", "  We predict the thermal counterpart of the anomalous Josephson effect in\nsuperconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor junctions with non-coplanar magnetic\ntexture. The heat current through the junction is shown to have the\nphase-sensitive interference component proportional to $\\cos(\\theta -\n\\theta_0)$, where $\\theta$ is the Josephson phase difference and $\\theta_0$ is\nthe texture-dependent phase shift. In the generic tri-layer magnetic structure\nwith the spin-filtering tunnel barrier $\\theta_0$ is determined by the spin\nchirality of magnetic configuration and can be considered as the direct\nmanifestation of the energy transport with participation of spin-triplet Cooper\npairs. In case of the ideal spin filter the phase shift is shown to be robust\nagainst spin relaxation caused by the spin-orbital scattering. Possible\napplications of the coupling between heat flow and magnetic precession are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Our paper [Phys. Rev. A 93, 052512 (2016)], proposing a novel form of single\ndeterminant wave function that admits non-idempotent 1-electron density\nmatrices, has recently received a Comment [Phys. Rev. A ??, 0????? (2017)]\nsuggesting a number of flaws: The form of the 1-electron density matrix that we\nproposed is deemed invalid; None of the currently known functionals are given\nin terms of the 1-electron density matrix but known only in the basis where the\ndensity matrix is diagonal; In NOFT the energy is not invariant with respect to\nunitary transformations of the orbitals; The M\\\"uller functional we used\nsuffers from serious shortcomings; In NOFT there detachment energies should be\nobtained from the extended Koopmans theorem. Below we will address these\ncriticisms in sequence.\n", "  We investigate the spin Hall effect (SHE) of electrons described by the Dirac\nequation, which is used as an effective model near the $L$-points in bismuth.\nBy considering short-range nonmagnetic impurities, we calculate the extrinsic\nas well as intrinsic contributions on an equal footing. The vertex corrections\nare taken into account within the ladder type and the so-called skew-scattering\ntype. The intrinsic SHE which we obtain is consistent with that of Fuseya et\nal. [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 81, 93704 (2012)]. It is found that the extrinsic\ncontribution dominates the intrinsic one when the system is (semi)metallic. The\nextrinsic SHE due to the skew scattering is proportional to $\\Delta / n_{\\rm i}\nu$, where $2\\Delta$ is the band gap, $n_{\\rm i}$ is the impurity concentration,\nand $u$ is the strength of the impurity potential.\n", "  We present SkyFACT (Sky Factorization with Adaptive Constrained Templates), a\nnew approach for studying, modeling and decomposing diffuse gamma-ray emission.\nLike most previous analyses, the approach relies on predictions from cosmic-ray\npropagation codes like GALPROP and DRAGON. However, in contrast to previous\napproaches, we account for the fact that models are not perfect and allow for a\nvery large number ($\\gtrsim10^5$) of nuisance parameters to parameterize these\nimperfections. We combine methods of image reconstruction and adaptive\nspatio-spectral template regression in one coherent hybrid approach. To this\nend, we use penalized Poisson likelihood regression, with regularization\nfunctions that are motivated by the maximum entropy method. We introduce\nmethods to efficiently handle the high dimensionality of the convex\noptimization problem as well as the associated semi-sparse covariance matrix,\nusing the L-BFGS-B algorithm and Cholesky factorization. We test the method\nboth on synthetic data as well as on gamma-ray emission from the inner Galaxy,\n$|\\ell|<90^\\circ$ and $|b|<20^\\circ$, as observed by the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope. We finally define a simple reference model that removes most of the\nresidual emission from the inner Galaxy, based on conventional diffuse emission\ncomponents as well as components for the Fermi bubbles, the Fermi Galactic\ncenter excess, and extended sources along the Galactic disk. Variants of this\nreference model can serve as basis for future studies of diffuse emission in\nand outside the Galactic disk.\n", "  Selective ion transport is a hallmark of biological ion channel behavior but\nis a major challenge to engineer into artificial membranes. Here, we\ndemonstrate, with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, that bare graphene\nnanopores yield measurable ion selectivity that varies over one to two orders\nof magnitude simply by changing the pore radius and number of graphene layers.\nMonolayer graphene does not display dehydration-induced selectivity until the\npore radius is small enough to exclude the first hydration layer from inside\nthe pore. Bi- and tri-layer graphene, though, display such selectivity already\nfor a pore size that barely encroaches on the first hydration layer, which is\ndue to the more significant water loss from the second hydration layer.\nMeasurement of selectivity and activation barriers from both first and second\nhydration layer barriers will help elucidate the behavior of biological ion\nchannels. Moreover, the energy barriers responsible for selectivity -- while\nsmall on the scale of hydration energies -- are already relatively large, i.e.,\nmany $k_B$. For separation of ions from water, therefore, one can exchange\nlonger, larger radius pores for shorter, smaller radius pores, giving a\npractical method for maintaining exclusion efficiency while enhancing other\nproperties (e.g., water throughput).\n", "  How to effectively construct robust quantum gates for time-varying noise is a\nvery important but still outstanding problem. Here we develop a systematic\nmethod to find pulses for quantum gate operations robust against both low- and\nhigh-frequency (comparable to the qubit transition frequency) stochastic\ntime-varying noise. Our approach, taking into account the noise properties of\nquantum computing systems, can output single smooth pulses in the presence of\nmulti-sources of noise. Furthermore, our method can be applied to different\nsystem models and noise models, and will make essential steps toward\nconstructing high-fidelity and robust quantum gates for fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation. Finally, we discuss and compare the gate operation performance by\nour method with that by the filter-transfer-function method.\n", "  We propose a bosonic Josephson junction (BJJ) in two nonlinear mechanical\nresonator coupled through two-phonon exchange interaction induced by quadratic\noptomechanical couplings. The nonlinear dynamic equations and effective\nHamiltonian are derived to describe behaviors of the BJJ. We show that the BJJ\ncan work in two different dynamical regimes: Josephson oscillation and\nmacroscopic self-trapping. The system can transfer from one regime to the other\none when the self-interaction and asymmetric parameters exceed their critical\nvalues. We predict that a transition from Josephson oscillation to macroscopic\nself-trapping can be induced by the phonon damping in the asymmetric BJJs. Our\nresults opens up a way to demonstrate BJJ with two-phonon exchange interaction\nand can be applied to other systems, such as the optical and microwave systems.\n", "  Effective supergravity inflationary models induced by anti-D3 brane\ninteraction with the moduli fields in the bulk geometry have a geometric\ndescription. The K\\\"ahler function carries the complete geometric information\non the theory. The non-vanishing bisectional curvature plays an important role\nin the construction. The new geometric formalism, with the nilpotent superfield\nrepresenting the anti-D3 brane, allows a powerful generalization of the\nexisting inflationary models based on supergravity. They can easily incorporate\narbitrary values of the Hubble parameter, cosmological constant and gravitino\nmass. We illustrate it by providing generalized versions of polynomial chaotic\ninflation, T- and E-models of $\\alpha$-attractor type, disk merger. We also\ndescribe a multi-stage cosmological attractor regime, which we call cascade\ninflation.\n", "  Studies on out-of-equilibrium dynamics have paved a way to realize a new\nstate of matter. Especially, superconductor-like properties above room\ntemperatures recently suggested in copper oxides achieved by selectively\nexciting vibrational phonon modes by laser have inspired studies on an\nalternative and general strategy to be pursued for high temperature\nsuperconductivity. Here, we show that the superconductivity can be enhanced by\nirradiating laser to correlated electron systems owing to two mechanisms:\nFirst, the effective attractive interaction of carriers is enhanced by the\ndynamical localization mechanism, which drives the system into strong coupling\nregions. Secondly, the irradiation allows reaching uniform and enhanced\nsuperconductivity dynamically stabilized without deteriorating into equilibrium\ninhomogeneities that suppress superconductivity. The dynamical\nsuperconductivity is subject to the Higgs oscillations during and after the\nirradiation. Our finding shed light on a way to enhance superconductivity that\nis inaccessible in equilibrium in strongly correlated electron systems.\n", "  The excited states of polyatomic systems are rather complex, and often\nexhibit meta-stable dynamical behaviors. Static analysis of reaction pathway\noften fails to sufficiently characterize excited state motions due to their\nhighly non-equilibrium nature. Here, we proposed a time series guided\nclustering algorithm to generate most relevant meta-stable patterns directly\nfrom ab initio dynamic trajectories. Based on the knowledge of these\nmeta-stable patterns, we suggested an interpolation scheme with only a concrete\nand finite set of known patterns to accurately predict the ground and excited\nstate properties of the entire dynamics trajectories. As illustrated with the\nexample of sinapic acids, the estimation error for both ground and excited\nstate is very close, which indicates one could predict the ground and excited\nstate molecular properties with similar accuracy. These results may provide us\nsome insights to construct an excited state force field with compatible energy\nterms as traditional ones.\n", "  We show that the Hilbert space of physical states on a pure $Z_2$ gauge\nlattice in $1 + 1$ and $2 + 1$ dimensions is geometrically separable if the\nfundamental physical degrees of freedom are taken to be the plaquettes. This\nresults in a physical entanglement entropy that is not affected by gauge\nfixing. We introduce a lattice model that is physically equivalent to the\noriginal and whose entanglement entropy, calculated using link degrees of\nfreedom, is the same as the entanglement entropy calculated using physical\nstates. We also show that, for non-physical gauge link states, entanglement\nentropy quantifies constraints between gauge choices in plaquettes adjacent to\nthe boundary.\n", "  The Hamiltonian structure of ideal translationally symmetric extended MHD\n(XMHD) is obtained by employing a method of Hamiltonian reduction on the\nthree-dimensional noncanonical Poisson bracket of XMHD. The existence of the\ncontinuous spatial translation symmetry allows the introduction of Clebsch-like\nforms for the magnetic and velocity fields. Upon employing the chain rule for\nfunctional derivatives, the 3D Poisson bracket is reduced to its symmetric\ncounterpart. The sets of symmetric Hall, Inertial, and extended MHD Casimir\ninvariants are identified, and used to obtain energy-Casimir variational\nprinciples for generalized XMHD equilibrium equations with arbitrary\nmacroscopic flows. The obtained set of generalized equations is cast into\nGrad-Shafranov-Bernoulli (GSB) type, and special cases are investigated: static\nplasmas, equilibria with longitudinal flows only, and Hall MHD equilibria,\nwhere the electron inertia is neglected. The barotropic Hall MHD equilibrium\nequations are derived as a limiting case of the XMHD GSB system, and a\nnumerically computed equilibrium configuration is presented that shows the\nseparation of ion-flow from electromagnetic surfaces.\n", "  The cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ used to be a freedom in Einstein's theory\nof general relativity, where one had a proclivity to set it to zero purely for\nconvenience. The signs of $\\Lambda$ or $\\Lambda$ being zero would describe\nuniverses with different properties. For instance, the conformal structure of\nspacetime directly depends on $\\Lambda$: null infinity $\\mathcal{I}$ is a\nspacelike, null, or timelike hypersurface, if $\\Lambda>0$, $\\Lambda=0$, or\n$\\Lambda<0$, respectively. Recent observations of distant supernovae have\ntaught us that our universe expands at an accelerated rate, and this can be\naccounted for by choosing $\\Lambda>0$ in Einstein's theory of general\nrelativity. A quantity that depends on the conformal structure of spacetime,\nespecially on the nature of $\\mathcal{I}$, is the Bondi mass which in turn\ndictates the mass loss of an isolated gravitating system due to energy carried\naway by gravitational waves. This problem of extending the Bondi mass to a\nuniverse with $\\Lambda>0$ has spawned intense research activity over the past\nseveral years. Some aspects include a closer inspection on the conformal\nproperties, working with linearisation, attempts using a Hamiltonian\nformulation based on \"linearised\" asymptotic symmetries, as well as obtaining\nthe general asymptotic solutions of de Sitter-like spacetimes. We consolidate\non the progress thus far from the various approaches that have been undertaken,\nas well as discuss the current open problems and possible directions in this\narea.\n", "  The adsorption behavior of toxic gas molecules (NO, CO, NO2, and NH3) on\ngraphene-like BC3 are investigated using first-principle density functional\ntheory (DFT). The most stable adsorption configurations, adsorption\nenergies,binding distances,charge transfers,electronic band structures,and the\nconductance modulations are calculated to deeply understand the impacts of the\nmolecules above on the electronic and transport properties of the BC3\nmonolayer. The graphene-like BC3 monolayer is a semiconductor with a band gap\nof 0.733 eV. The semi-metal graphene has a low sensitivity to the\nabovementioned molecules. However, it is discovered that all the above gas\nmolecules are chemically adsorbed on the BC3 sheet with the adsorption energies\nless than -1 eV. The NO2 gas molecule is totally dissociated into NO and O\nspecies through the adsorption process, while the other gas molecules retain\ntheir molecular forms. The amounts of charge transfer upon adsorption of CO and\nNH3 gas molecules on BC3 are found to be small. Hence, the band gap changes in\nBC3 as a result of interactions with CO and NH3 are only 4.63% and 16.7%,\nindicating that the BC3-based sensor has a low and moderate sensitivity to CO\nand NH3, respectively. Contrariwise, upon adsorption of NO or NO2 on BC3, a\nsignificant charge is transferred from the molecules to the BC3 sheet, causing\na semiconductor-metal transition. It is found that the BC3-based sensor has\nhigh potential for NO detection due to the significant conductance changes,\nmoderate adsorption energy, and short recovery time. More excitingly, the BC3\nis a likely catalyst for dissociation of the NO2 gas molecule. Our findings\ndivulge promising potential of the graphene-like BC3 as a highly sensitive\nmolecular sensor for NO and NH3 detection and a catalyst for NO2 dissociation\n", "  We present a consistent microscopic study of spin pumping effects for both\nmetallic and insulating ferromagnets. As for metallic case, we present a simple\nquantum mechanical picture of the effect as due to the electron spin flip as a\nresult of a nonadiabatic (off-diagonal) spin gauge field. The effect of\ninterface spin-orbit interaction is briefly discussed. We also carry out\nfield-theoretic calculation to discuss on the equal footing the spin current\ngeneration and torque effects such as enhanced Gilbert damping constant and\nshift of precession frequency both in metallic and insulating cases. For thick\nferromagnetic metal, our study reproduces results of previous theories such as\nthe correspondence between the dc component of the spin current and enhancement\nof the damping. For thin metal and insulator, the relation turns out to be\nmodified. For the insulating case, driven locally by interface $sd$ exchange\ninteraction due to magnetic proximity effect, physical mechanism is distinct\nfrom the metallic case. Further study of proximity effect and interface\nspin-orbit interaction would be crucial to interpret experimental results in\nparticular for insulators.\n", "  In this letter, we have investigated the deflection angle of light by\nwormholes using a new geometrical method known as Gibbons-Werner method (GW).\nIn particular we have calculated the deflection angle of light in the weak\nlimit approximation in two wormhole spacetime geometries: Ellis wormhole and\nJanis-Newman-Winnicour (JNW) wormhole. We have employed the famous Gauss-Bonnet\ntheorem (GBT) to the Ellis wormhole optical geometry and JNW wormhole optical\ngeometry, respectively. By using GBT, we computed the deflection angles in\nleading orders by these wormholes and our results were compared with the ones\nin the literature.\n", "  The past several years have seen renewed interest in the use of\nsymmetry-projected Hartree-Fock for the description of strong correlations.\nUnfortunately, these symmetry-projected mean-field methods do not adequately\naccount for dynamic correlation. Presumably, this shortcoming could be\naddressed if one could combine symmetry-projected Hartree-Fock with a many-body\nmethod such as coupled cluster theory, but this is by no means straightforward\nbecause the two techniques are formulated in very different ways. However, we\nhave recently shown that the singlet $S^2$-projected unrestricted Hartree-Fock\nwave function can in fact be written in a coupled cluster-like wave function:\nthat is, the spin-projected unrestricted Hartree-Fock wave function can be\nwritten as a polynomial of a double-excitation operator acting on some\nclosed-shell reference determinant. Here, we extend this result and show that\nthe spin-projected generalized Hartree-Fock wave function (which has both $S^2$\nand $S_z$ projection) is likewise a polynomial of low-order excitation\noperators acting on a closed-shell determinant, and provide a closed-form\nexpression for the resulting polynomial coefficients. We include a few\npreliminary applications of the combination of this spin-projected Hartree-Fock\nand coupled cluster theory to the Hubbard Hamiltonian, and comment on\ngeneralizations of the methodology. Results here are not for production level,\nbut a similarity transformed theory that combines the two offers the promise of\nbeing accurate for both weak and strong correlation, and particularly may offer\nsignificant improvements in the intermediate correlation regime where neither\nprojected Hartree-Fock nor coupled cluster is particularly accurate.\n", "  Subject of this paper falls under the broad heading of the propagation of\ndisturbances causing transition in a fully developed spiral annular flow. The\nproblem is approached through reformulation of the linearised equations of\nmotion governing small-amplitude disturbances in a parameter space that differs\nfrom that conventionally employed for this purpose. The alternative parameter\nspace comprises a suitably defined Reynolds number that is formed with a\nresultant characteristic velocity which is a vector sum of the axial and\nazimuthal characteristic velocities, a swirl parameter that is the ratio of the\nazimuthal to the axial characteristic velocity, and the ratio of the annular\ngap to the mean diameter of the cylinders. In the limits of the swirl parameter\nassuming very small or very large values, the newly derived generalised\nOrr-Sommerfeld and Squire equations for disturbance propagation in the revised\nparameter space reduce to the corresponding equations that are known and well\nestablished for the limiting cases of disturbance propagation as the swirl\nparameter goes to zero or infinity respectively. Furthermore, they also lead\nnaturally to the criterion that determines from the equations themselves the\nanalytical expression for the location of the critical layer in spiral annular\nflow, the scaling behaviour of the thickness of the critical layer with the\nReynolds number and the swirl parameter, and the equation governing the\ndynamics of the flow in the critical layer. They thus explicitly reveal the\neffect of swirl on the critical layer.\n", "  We introduce the Convex Hull of Admissible Modularity Partitions (CHAMP)\nalgorithm to prune and prioritize different network community structures\nidentified across multiple runs of possibly various computational heuristics.\nGiven a set of partitions, CHAMP identifies the domain of modularity\noptimization for each partition ---i.e., the parameter-space domain where it\nhas the largest modularity relative to the input set---discarding partitions\nwith empty domains to obtain the subset of partitions that are \"admissible\"\ncandidate community structures that remain potentially optimal over indicated\nparameter domains. Importantly, CHAMP can be used for multi-dimensional\nparameter spaces, such as those for multilayer networks where one includes a\nresolution parameter and interlayer coupling. Using the results from CHAMP, a\nuser can more appropriately select robust community structures by observing the\nsizes of domains of optimization and the pairwise comparisons between\npartitions in the admissible subset. We demonstrate the utility of CHAMP with\nseveral example networks. In these examples, CHAMP focuses attention onto\npruned subsets of admissible partitions that are 20-to-1785 times smaller than\nthe sets of unique partitions obtained by community detection heuristics that\nwere input into CHAMP.\n", "  Space-based transit surveys such as K2 and TESS allow the detection of small\ntransiting planets with orbital periods beyond 10 days. Few of these warm\nNeptunes are currently known around stars bright enough to allow for detailed\nfollow-up observations dedicated to their atmospheric characterization. The\n21-day period and 3.95 $R_\\oplus$ planet HD106315c has been discovered based on\nthe observation of two of its transits by K2. We have observed HD106315 using\nthe 1.2m Euler telescope equipped with the EulerCam camera on two instances to\nconfirm the transit using broad band photometry and refine the planetary\nperiod. Based on two observed transits of HD106315c, we detect its $\\sim$1 mmag\ntransit and obtain a precise measurement of the planetary ephemerids, which are\ncritical for planning further follow-up observations. We have used the attained\nprecision together with the predicted yield from the TESS mission to evaluate\nthe potential for ground-based confirmation of Neptune-sized planets found by\nTESS. We find that 1-meter-class telescopes on the ground equipped with precise\nphotometers could substantially contribute to the follow-up of 162 TESS\ncandidates orbiting stars with magnitudes of $V \\leq 14$. Out of these, 74\nplanets orbit stars with $V \\leq 12$ and 12 planets orbit $V \\leq 10$, which\nmakes these candidates high-priority objects for atmospheric characterization\nwith high-end instrumentation.\n", "  We examine the momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum of structured\nmonochromatic optical fields in dispersive inhomogeneous isotropic media. There\nare two bifurcations in this general problem: the Abraham-Minkowski dilemma and\nthe kinetic (Poynting-like) versus canonical (spin-orbital) pictures. We show\nthat the kinetic Abraham momentum describes the energy flux and group velocity\nof the wave in the medium. At the same time, we introduce novel canonical\nMinkowsky-type momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum densities of the\nfield. These quantities exhibit fairly natural forms, analogous to the\nBrillouin energy density, as well as multiple advantages as compared with\npreviously considered formalisms. We apply this general theory to inhomogeneous\nsurface plasmon-polariton (SPP) waves at a metal-vacuum interface and show that\nSPPs carry a \"super-momentum\", proportional to the wave vector $k_{p} >\n\\omega/c$, and a transverse spin, which can change its sign depending on the\nfrequency $\\omega$.\n", "  This paper proposes a novel method to filter out the false alarm of LiDAR\nsystem by using the temporal correlation of target reflected photons. Because\nof the inevitable noise, which is due to background light and dark counts of\nthe detector, the depth imaging of LiDAR system exists a large estimation\nerror. Our method combines the Poisson statistical model with the different\ndistribution feature of signal and noise in the time axis. Due to selecting a\nproper threshold, our method can effectively filter out the false alarm of\nsystem and use the ToFs of detected signal photons to rebuild the depth image\nof the scene. The experimental results reveal that by our method it can fast\ndistinguish the distance between two close objects, which is confused due to\nthe high background noise, and acquire the accurate depth image of the scene.\nOur method need not increase the complexity of the system and is useful in\npower-limited depth imaging.\n", "  We introduce a practical calculation scheme for the description of excited\nelectron dynamics in molecular aggregated systems within a locally group\ndiabatic Fock representation. This scheme makes it easy to analyze the\ninteracting time-dependent excitations of local sites in complex systems. In\naddition, light-electron couplings are considered. The present scheme is\nintended for investigations on the migration dynamics of excited electrons in\nlight-energy conversion systems. The scheme was applied to two systems: a\nnaphthalene(NPTL)-tetracyanoethylene(TCNE) dimer and a 20-mer circle of\nethylene molecules. Through local group analyses of the dynamical electrons, we\nobtained an intuitive understanding of the electron transfers between the\nmonomers.\n", "  Given sufficient examples, recently introduced machine learning models enable\nrapid, yet accurate, predictions of properties of new molecules. Extrapolation\nto larger molecules with differing composition is prohibitive due to all the\nspecific chemistries which would be required for training. We address this\nproblem by exploiting redundancies due to chemical similarity of repeating\nbuilding blocks each represented by an effective {\\underline a}tom in\n{\\underline m}olecule: The \"am-on\". In analogy to the DNA sequence in a gene\nencoding its function, constituting amons encode a query molecule's properties.\nThe use of amons affords highly accurate machine learning predictions of\nquantum properties of arbitrary query molecules in real time. We investigate\nthis approach for predicting energies of various covalently and non-covalently\nbonded systems. After training on the few amons detected, very low prediction\nerrors can be reached, on par with experimental uncertainty. Systems studied\ninclude two dozen large biomolecules, eleven thousand medium sized organic\nmolecules, large common polymers, water clusters, doped $h$BN sheets, bulk\nsilicon, and Watson-Crick DNA base pairs. Conceptually, the amons extend\nMendeleev's table to account for the chemical environments of elements. They\nrepresent an important stepping stone to machine learning based virtual\nchemical space exploration campaigns.\n", "  We report on the characterization, including residual phase noise and\nfractional frequency instability, of fiber-coupled PPLN non-linear crystals.\nThese components are devoted to frequency doubling 871 nm light from an\nextended-cavity diode laser to produce a 435.5 nm beam, corresponding to the\nytterbium ion electric quadrupole clock transition. We measure doubling\nefficiencies of up to 117.5 %/W. Using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and an\noriginal noise rejection technique, the residual phase noise of the doublers is\nestimated to be lower than ${\\rm -35\\, dBrad^2/Hz}$ at 1 Hz, making these\nmodules compatible with up-to-date optical clocks and ultra-stable cavities.\nThe influence of external parameters such as pump laser frequency and intensity\nis investigated, showing that they do not limit the stability of the\nfrequency-doubled signal. Our results demonstrate that such compact,\nfiber-coupled modules are suitable for use in ultra-low phase noise\nmetrological experiments, including transportable optical atomic clocks.\n", "  Phase transitions between different states of matter can profoundly modify\nthe order in physical systems, with the emergence of ferromagnetic or\ntopological order constituting important examples. Correlations allow to\nquantify the degree of order and classify different phases. Here we report\nmeasurements of first-order spatial correlations in a harmonically trapped\ntwo-dimensional photon gas below, at, and above the critical particle number\nfor Bose-Einstein condensation, using interferometric measurements of the\nemission of a dye-filled optical microcavity. For the uncondensed gas, the\ntransverse coherence decays on a length scale determined by the thermal de\nBroglie wavelength of the photons, which shows the expected scaling with\ntemperature. At the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation true long-range order\nemerges, and we observe quantum statistical effects as the thermal wave packets\noverlap. The excellent agreement with equilibrium Bose gas theory prompts\nmicrocavity photons as promising candidates for studies of critical scaling and\nuniversality in optical quantum gases.\n", "  We investigate the topological phase derived by time-reversal breaking fields\nin a nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected two-dimensional Dirac semimetal. When the\nnonsymmorphic symmetry is preserved even in the presence of the field, the\ntwo-dimensional electronic states change into two distinct topological phases\nwith the insulating gap. One phase is well-known as quantum Hall states with\nchiral edge modes accompanying the Hall current, but the other one is an\nunconventional topological phase with helical edge modes in the absence of\ntime-reversal symmetry.\n", "  Energetic ionized gas outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) have\nbeen studied as a key phenomenon related to AGN feedback. To probe the\nkinematics of the gas in the narrow line region, [O III] ${\\lambda}$5007 has\nbeen utilized in a number of studies, showing non-virial kinematic properties\ndue to AGN outflows. In this paper, we statistically investigate whether the\nH-alpha emission line is influenced by AGN driven outflows, by measuring the\nkinematic properties based on the H-alpha line profile, and by comparing them\nwith those of [O III]. Using the spatially integrated spectra of ~37,000 Type 2\nAGNs at z < 0.3 selected from the SDSS DR7, we find a non-linear correlation\nbetween H-alpha velocity dispersion and stellar velocity dispersion, which\nreveals the presence of the non-gravitational component, especially for AGNs\nwith a wing component in H-alpha. The large H-alpha velocity dispersion and\nvelocity shift of luminous AGNs are clear evidence of AGN outflow impacts on\nhydrogen gas, while relatively smaller kinematic properties compared to those\nof [O III] imply that the observed outflow effect on the H-alpha line is weaker\nthan the case of [O III].\n", "  The well-known Jarzynski equality, often written in the form $e^{-\\beta\\Delta\nF}=\\langle e^{-\\beta W}\\rangle$, provides a non-equilibrium means to measure\nthe free energy difference $\\Delta F$ of a system at the same inverse\ntemperature $\\beta$ based on an ensemble average of non-equilibrium work $W$.\nThe accuracy of Jarzynski's measurement scheme was known to be determined by\nthe variance of exponential work, denoted as ${\\rm var}\\left(e^{-\\beta\nW}\\right)$. However, it was recently found that ${\\rm var}\\left(e^{-\\beta\nW}\\right)$ can systematically diverge in both classical and quantum cases. Such\ndivergence will necessarily pose a challenge in the applications of Jarzynski\nequality because it may dramatically reduce the efficiency in determining\n$\\Delta F$. In this work, we present a deformed Jarzynski equality for both\nclassical and quantum non-equilibrium statistics, in efforts to reuse\nexperimental data that already suffers from a diverging ${\\rm\nvar}\\left(e^{-\\beta W}\\right)$. The main feature of our deformed Jarzynski\nequality is that it connects free energies at different temperatures and it may\nstill work efficiently subject to a diverging ${\\rm var}\\left(e^{-\\beta\nW}\\right)$. The conditions for applying our deformed Jarzynski equality may be\nmet in experimental and computational situations. If so, then there is no need\nto redesign experimental or simulation methods. Furthermore, using the deformed\nJarzynski equality, we exemplify the distinct behaviors of classical and\nquantum work fluctuations for the case of a time-dependent driven harmonic\noscillator dynamics and provide insights into the essential performance\ndifferences between classical and quantum Jarzynski equalities.\n", "  \"Optimal\" criteria for quantization are presented and compared to classical\ncriteria and predictions. Thereby several existing approaches involving hull\ncomputations for convex correlation polytopes are reviewed, discussed and\nexploited. Increasingly intertwined contexts impose ever tighter conditions on\nobservables which gradually cannot be satisfied by (quasi-)classical systems.\nIn these regimes, observables of quantized systems clearly outperform classical\nones.\n", "  The maximum coercivity that can be achieved for a given hard magnetic alloy\nis estimated by computing the energy barrier for the nucleation of a reversed\ndomain in an idealized microstructure without any structural defects and\nwithout any soft magnetic secondary phases. For\nSm$_{1-z}$Zr$_z$(Fe$_{1-y}$Co$_y$)$_{12-x}$Ti$_x$ based alloys, which are\nconsidered an alternative to Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B magnets with lower rare-earth\ncontent, the coercive field of a small magnetic cube is reduced to 60 percent\nof the anisotropy field at room temperature and to 50 percent of the anisotropy\nfield at elevated temperature (473K). This decrease of the coercive field is\ncaused by misorientation, demagnetizing fields and thermal fluctuations.\n", "  While computing the Fermi degeneracy pressure of electrons in a white dwarf\nstar within the framework of hydrostatic equilibrium, we depart from the extant\npractice of treating the electrons as a free fermion gas, by including the\neffect of the star's self-gravity as an effective gravitational potential. By\nthe star's self gravity, we mean the gravitational field due to the star\nitself, resulting from the mass of its constituent atoms, the mass of the atom\nbeing effectively the mass of the proton. Modifying the free particle\nHamiltonian with this effective potential, we employ first order quantum\nmechanical perturbation theory to compute the degeneracy pressure, in order to\nstudy the effect of inclusion of this self-gravity of the star on the\nChandrasekhar limiting mass. The final effect is found to be non-trivial, but\nperhaps a shade too small to alter any major observational result.\n", "  Complexions are phase-like interfacial features that can influence a wide\nvariety of properties, but the ability to predict which material systems can\nsustain these features remains limited. Amorphous complexions are of particular\ninterest due to their ability to enhance diffusion and damage tolerance\nmechanisms, as a result of the excess free volume present in these structures.\nIn this paper, we propose a set of materials selection rules aimed at\npredicting the formation of amorphous complexions, with an emphasis on (1)\nencouraging the segregation of dopants to the interfaces and (2) lowering the\nformation energy for a glassy structure. To validate these predictions, binary\nCu-rich metallic alloys encompassing a range of thermodynamic parameter values\nwere created using sputter deposition and subsequently heat treated to allow\nfor segregation and transformation of the boundary structure. All of the alloys\nstudied here experienced dopant segregation to the grain boundary, but\nexhibited different interfacial structures. Cu-Zr and Cu-Hf formed nanoscale\namorphous intergranular complexions while Cu-Nb and Cu-Mo retained crystalline\norder at their grain boundaries, which can mainly be attributed to differences\nin the enthalpy of mixing. Finally, using our newly formed materials selection\nrules, we extend our scope to a Ni-based alloy to further validate our\nhypothesis, as well as make predictions for a wide variety of transition metal\nalloys.\n", "  MAGIC is a system of two Cherenkov telescopes designed to perform\nobservations of gamma rays with energies from about 50 GeV to tens of TeV. A\nlow energy threshold and an excellent low energy performance make it a powerful\ninstrument for studies of high energy processes in Active Galactic Nuclei\n(AGN). The MAGIC Collaboration dedicates about 40% of the telescopes' time to\nsuch observations, both monitoring of known emitters, and Target of Opportunity\nobservations of flaring events. In this presentation we will discuss the recent\nhighlights of the MAGIC AGN program. In particular, multi year monitoring of\nradio galaxies, such as M87, and strong peculiar blazars, such as PG 1553+113,\nwill be presented together with new discoveries based on the Target Of\nOpportunity program.\n", "  PKS1510-089 is a flat spectrum radio quasar located at a redshift of 0.36. It\nis one of only a few such sources detected in very-high-energy (VHE, >100 GeV)\ngamma rays. Though PKS1510-089 is highly variable at GeV energies, until\nrecently no variability has been observed in the VHE band. In 2015 May\nPKS1510-089 showed a high state in optical and in the GeV range. A VHE\ngamma-ray flare was detected with MAGIC at that time, showing the first\ninstance of VHE gamma-ray flux variability on the time scale of days in this\nsource. We will present the MAGIC results from this observation, discuss their\ntemporal and spectral properties in the multi-wavelength context and present\nmodelling of such emission in the external Compton scenario.\n", "  We discuss how visions for the futures of humanity in space and SETI are\nintertwined, and are shaped by prior work in the fields and by science fiction.\nThis appears in the language used in the fields, and in the sometimes implicit\nassumptions made in discussions of them. We give examples from articulations of\nthe so-called Fermi Paradox, discussions of the settlement of the Solar System\n(in the near future) and the Galaxy (in the far future), and METI. We argue\nthat science fiction, especially the campy variety, is a significant\ncontributor to the \"giggle factor\" that hinders serious discussion and funding\nfor SETI and Solar System settlement projects. We argue that humanity's\nlong-term future in space will be shaped by our short-term visions for who goes\nthere and how. Because of the way they entered the fields, we recommend\navoiding the term \"colony\" and its cognates when discussing the settlement of\nspace, as well as other terms with similar pedigrees. We offer examples of\nscience fiction and other writing that broaden and challenge our visions of\nhuman futures in space and SETI. In an appendix, we use an analogy with the\nwell-funded and relatively uncontroversial searches for the dark matter\nparticle to argue that SETI's lack of funding in the national science portfolio\nis primarily a problem of perception, not inherent merit.\n", "  Many people see a human face or animals in the pattern of the maria on the\nmoon. Although the pattern corresponds to the actual variation in composition\nof the lunar surface, the culture and environment of each society influence the\nrecognition of these objects (i.e., symbols) as specific entities. In contrast,\na convolutional neural network (CNN) recognizes objects from characteristic\nshapes in a training data set. Using CNN, this study evaluates the\nprobabilities of the pattern of lunar maria categorized into the shape of a\ncrab, a lion and a hare. If Mare Frigoris (a dark band on the moon) is included\nin the lunar image, the lion is recognized. However, in an image without Mare\nFrigoris, the hare has the highest probability of recognition. Thus, the\nrecognition of objects similar to the lunar pattern depends on which part of\nthe lunar maria is taken into account. In human recognition, before we find\nsimilarities between the lunar maria and objects such as animals, we may be\npersuaded in advance to see a particular image from our culture and environment\nand then adjust the lunar pattern to the shape of the imagined object.\n", "  Weyl fermions have not been found in nature as elementary particles, but they\nemerge as nodal points in the band structure of electronic and classical wave\ncrystals. Novel phenomena such as Fermi arcs and chiral anomaly have fueled the\ninterest in these topological points which are frequently perceived as\nmonopoles in momentum space. Here we report the experimental observation of\ngeneralized optical Weyl points inside the parameter space of a photonic\ncrystal with a specially designed four-layer unit cell. The reflection at the\nsurface of a truncated photonic crystal exhibits phase vortexes due to the\nsynthetic Weyl points, which in turn guarantees the existence of interface\nstates between photonic crystals and any reflecting substrates. The reflection\nphase vortexes have been confirmed for the first time in our experiments which\nserve as an experimental signature of the generalized Weyl points. The\nexistence of these interface states is protected by the topological properties\nof the Weyl points and the trajectories of these states in the parameter space\nresembles those of Weyl semimetal \"Fermi arcs surface states\" in momentum\nspace. Tracing the origin of interface states to the topological character of\nthe parameter space paves the way for a rational design of strongly localized\nstates with enhanced local field.\n", "  Two techniques that employ equally spaced trains of optical pulses to map an\noptical high frequency into a low frequency modulation of the signal that can\nbe detected in real time are compared. The development of phase-stable optical\nfrequency combs has opened up new avenues to metrology and spectroscopy. The\nability to generate a series of frequency spikes with precisely controlled\nseparation permits a fast, highly accurate sampling of the material response.\nRecently, pairs of frequency combs with slightly different repetition rates\nhave been utilized to down-convert material susceptibilities from the optical\nto microwave regime where they can be recorded in real time. We show how this\none-dimensional dual comb technique can be extended to multiple dimensions by\nusing several combs. We demonstrate how nonlinear susceptibilities can be\nquickly acquired using this technique. In a second class of techniques,\nsequences of ultrafast mode locked laser pulses are used to recover pathways of\ninteractions contributing to nonlinear susceptibilities by using a\nphoto-acoustic modulation varying along the sequences. We show that these\ntechniques can be viewed as a time-domain analogue of the multiple frequency\ncomb scheme. %We compare the two techniques: in both, an optical high frequency\nis mapped into a low frequency modulation of the signal that can be detected in\nreal time.\n", "  As is well known, some aspects of General Relativity and Cosmology can be\nreproduced without even using Einstein's equation. As an illustration, the 0 -\n0 component of the Schwarzschild space can be obtained by the requirement that\nthe geodesic of slowly mov- ing particles match the Newtonian equation. Given\nthis result, we shall show here that the remaining component (grr) can be\nobtained by requiring that the inside of a Newtonian ball of dust matched at a\nfree falling radius with the external space of unspecified type. This matching\ndetermines the external space to be of Schwarzschild type. By this, it is also\npossi- ble to determine that the constant of integration that appears in the\nNewtonian Cosmology, coincides with the spatial curvature of the FLRW metric.\nAll we assumed was some classical boundary conditions and basic assumptions.\n", "  We provide new insight on the origin of the cold high-V$_{\\rm los}$ peaks\n($\\sim$200 kms$^{-1}$) in the Milky Way bulge discovered in the APOGEE\ncommissioning data \\citep{Nidever2012}. Here we show that such kinematic\nbehaviour present in the field regions towards the Galactic bulge is not likely\nassociated with orbits that build the boxy/peanut (B/P) bulge. To this purpose,\na new set of test particle simulations of a kinematically cold stellar disk\nevolved in a 3D steady-state barred Milky Way galactic potential, has been\nanalysed in detail. Especially bar particles trapped into the bar are\nidentified through the orbital Jacobi energy $E_{J}$, which allows us to\nidentify the building blocks of the B/P feature and investigate their kinematic\nproperties. Finally, we present preliminary results showing that the\nhigh-V$_{\\rm los}$ features observed towards the Milky Way bulge are a natural\nconsequence of a large-scale \\textit{midplane} particle structure, which is\nunlikely associated with the Galactic bar.\n", "  We discuss how photoproduction and electroproduction processes will provide a\nprecise tool to study nuclear structure in the small-$x$ region in the future\nElectron-Ion Collider. In particular, we emphasize how exclusive vector meson\nproduction at the EIC can be used to accurately map the gluonic density profile\nof nuclei, including its event-by-event fluctuations. In addition, we show how\nmeasurements of the total diffractive cross section will be sensitive to\nsaturation effects.\n", "  We discuss searches for Axion-like Particles which are coupled predominantly\nto photons from proton- or electron beam-dumps. In particular, we scrutinize\nthe present state of exclusions from SLAC 141 in the mass range of $\\sim$ 10-30\nMeV\n", "  The detection of molecular species in the atmospheres of earth-like\nexoplanets orbiting nearby stars requires an optical system that suppresses\nstarlight and maximizes the sensitivity to the weak planet signals at small\nangular separations. Achieving sufficient contrast performance on a segmented\naperture space telescope is particularly challenging due to unwanted\ndiffraction within the telescope from amplitude and phase discontinuities in\nthe pupil. Apodized vortex coronagraphs are a promising solution that\ntheoretically meet the performance needs for high contrast imaging with future\nsegmented space telescopes. We investigate the sensitivity of apodized vortex\ncoronagraphs to the expected aberrations, including segment co-phasing errors\nin piston and tip/tilt as well as other low-order and mid-spatial frequency\naberrations. Coronagraph designs and their associated telescope requirements\nare identified for conceptual HabEx and LUVOIR telescope designs.\n", "  I describe a method for computer algebra that helps with laborious\ncalculations typically encountered in theoretical microhydrodynamics. The\nprogram mimics how humans calculate by matching patterns and making\nreplacements according to the rules of algebra and calculus. This note gives an\noverview and walks through an example, while the accompanying code repository\ncontains the implementation details, a tutorial, and more examples. The code\nrepository is attached as supplementary material to this note, and maintained\nat https://github.com/jeinarsson/matte\n", "  We construct an entangled quantum Otto engine based on spin-1/2 systems\nundergoing Dzyaloshinski-Moriya (DM) interaction within a varying magnetic\nfield. We investigate the influence of the DM interaction on basic\nthermodynamic quantities, including heat transfer, work done, and efficiency\nand find that the DM interaction importantly influences the engine's\nthermodynamics. We obtain an expression for engine efficiency, finding it to\nyield the same efficiency for antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling. A\nnew upper bound, nontrivially consistent with the second law of thermodynamics,\nis derived for engine efficiency in the case of non-zero DM interaction.\n", "  Turbulence remains an unsolved multidisciplinary science problem. As one of\nthe most well-known examples in turbulent flows, knowledge of the logarithmic\nmean velocity profile (MVP), so called the log law of the wall, plays an\nimportant role everywhere turbulent flow meets the solid wall, such as fluids\nin any kind of channels, skin friction of all types of transportations, the\natmospheric wind on a planetary ground, and the oceanic current on the seabed.\nHowever, the mechanism of how this log-law MVP is formed under the multiscale\nnature of turbulent shears remains one of the greatest interests of turbulence\npuzzles. To untangle the multiscale coupling of turbulent shear stresses, we\nexplore for a known fundamental tool in physics. Here we present how to\nreproduce the log-law MVP with the even harmonic modes of fixed-end standing\nwaves. We find that when these harmonic waves of same magnitude are considered\nas the multiscale turbulent shear stresses, the wave envelope of their\nsuperposition simulates the mean shear stress profile of the wall-bounded flow.\nIt implies that the log-law MVP is not expectedly related to the turbulent\nscales in the inertial subrange associated with the Kolmogorov energy cascade,\nrevealing the dissipative nature of all scales involved. The MVP with reduced\nharmonic modes also shows promising connection to the understanding of flow\ntransition to turbulence. The finding here suggests the simple harmonic waves\nas good agents to help unravel the complex turbulent dynamics in wall-bounded\nflow.\n", "  The ancestor philosophers' dream of thousands of new worlds is finally\nrealised: about 3500 extrasolar planets have been discovered in the\nneighborhood of our Sun. Most of them are very different from those we used to\nknow in our Solar System. Others orbit their parent star inside the belt known\nas Habitable Zone where a rocky planet with the appropriate climate could have\nthe availability of liquid water on its surface. Those planets, in HZ or not,\nwill be the object of observation that will be performed by new\nspace-/ground-based instrumentation. Space missions, such as JWST and the very\nrecently proposed ARIEL (ESA M-Class Mission), or ground based instruments\n(SPHERE@VLT, GPI@GEMINI and EPICS@ELT) have been proposed and built to measure\nthe atmospheric transmission, reflection and emission spectra over a wide\nwavelength range. Most of exoplanets have local counterparts in the Solar\nSystem planets that are available for comparative studies, but there are also\ninteresting outsider cases like super Earths. In our own system, proto-planet\nevolution was flanked by an active prebiotic chemistry that brought about the\nemergency of life on the Earth. The search for life signatures requires the\nknowledge of planet atmospheres, main objective of future exoplanetary space\nexplorations. As, for now, we have only one example of life in the universe, we\nare bound to study terrestrial organisms to assess possibilities of life on\nother planets and guide our search for possible extinct or extant life on other\nplanetary bodies. The planet atmosphere characteristics and possible\nbiosignatures will be inferred by studying such composite spectrum in order to\nidentify the emission/absorption lines/bands from atmospheric molecules as\nwater, carbon monoxide, methane, ammonia etc.\n", "  We introduce a topological theory to study quasiparticles in interacting\nand/or disordered many-body systems, which have a finite lifetime due to\ninelastic and/or elastic scattering. The one-body quasiparticle Hamiltonian\nincludes both the Bloch Hamiltonian of band theory and the self-energy due to\ninteractions, which is non-Hermitian when quasiparticle lifetime is finite. We\nstudy the topology of non-Hermitian quasiparticle Hamiltonians in momentum\nspace, whose energy spectrum is complex. The interplay of band structure and\nquasiparticle lifetime is found to have remarkable consequences in zero- and\nsmall-gap systems. In particular, we predict the existence of topological\nexceptional point and bulk Fermi arc in Dirac materials with two distinct\nquasiparticle lifetimes.\n", "  HD66051 is an eclipsing system with an orbital period of about 4.75 d that\nexhibits out-of-eclipse variability with the same period. New multicolour\nphotometric observations confirm the longevity of the secondary variations,\nwhich we interpret as a signature of surface inhomogeneities on one of the\ncomponents. Using archival and newly acquired high-resolution spectra, we have\nperformed a detailed abundance analysis. The primary component is a slowly\nrotating late B-type star ($T_{\\rm eff} = 12500\\pm200$ K; $\\log g = 4.0$,\n$v\\sin i = 27\\pm2$ km s$^{-1}$) with a highly peculiar composition reminiscent\nof the singular HgMn-related star HD 65949, which seems to be its closest\nanalogue. Some light elements as He, C, Mg, Al are depleted, while Si and P are\nenhanced. Except for Ni, all the iron-group elements, as well as most of the\nheavy elements, and in particular the REE elements, are overabundant. The\nsecondary component was estimated to be a slowly rotating A-type star ($T_{\\rm\neff} \\sim 8000$ K; $\\log g = 4.0$, $v\\sin i \\sim 18$ km s$^{-1}$). The unique\nconfiguration of HD\\,66051 opens up intriguing possibilities for future\nresearch, which might eventually and significantly contribute to the\nunderstanding of such diverse phenomena as atmospheric structure, mass\ntransfer, magnetic fields, photometric variability and the origin of chemical\nanomalies observed in HgMn stars and related objects.\n", "  Agent-Based Computing is a diverse research domain concerned with the\nbuilding of intelligent software based on the concept of \"agents\". In this\npaper, we use Scientometric analysis to analyze all sub-domains of agent-based\ncomputing. Our data consists of 1,064 journal articles indexed in the ISI web\nof knowledge published during a twenty year period: 1990-2010. These were\nretrieved using a topic search with various keywords commonly used in\nsub-domains of agent-based computing. In our proposed approach, we have\nemployed a combination of two applications for analysis, namely Network\nWorkbench and CiteSpace - wherein Network Workbench allowed for the analysis of\ncomplex network aspects of the domain, detailed visualization-based analysis of\nthe bibliographic data was performed using CiteSpace. Our results include the\nidentification of the largest cluster based on keywords, the timeline of\npublication of index terms, the core journals and key subject categories. We\nalso identify the core authors, top countries of origin of the manuscripts\nalong with core research institutes. Finally, our results have interestingly\nrevealed the strong presence of agent-based computing in a number of\nnon-computing related scientific domains including Life Sciences, Ecological\nSciences and Social Sciences.\n", "  Raman spectra obtained by the inelastic scattering of light by crystalline\nsolids contain contributions from first-order vibrational processes (e.g. the\nemission or absorption of one phonon, a quantum of vibration) as well as\nhigher-order processes with at least two phonons being involved. At second\norder, coupling with the entire phonon spectrum induces a response that may\nstrongly depend on the excitation energy, and reflects complex processes more\ndifficult to interpret. In particular, excitons (i.e. bound electron-hole\npairs) may enhance the absorption and emission of light, and couple strongly\nwith phonons in resonance conditions. We design and implement a\nfirst-principles methodology to compute second-order Raman scattering,\nincorporating dielectric responses and phonon eigenstates obtained from\ndensity-functional theory and many-body theory. We demonstrate our approach for\nthe case of silicon, relating frequency-dependent relative Raman intensities,\nthat are in excellent agreement with experiment, to different vibrations and\nregions of the Brillouin zone. We show that exciton-phonon coupling, computed\nfrom first principles, indeed strongly affect the spectrum in resonance\nconditions. The ability to analyze second-order Raman spectra thus provides\ndirect insight into this interaction.\n", "  In this paper we present a novel Formal Agent-Based Simulation framework\n(FABS). FABS uses formal specification as a means of clear description of\nwireless sensor networks (WSN) sensing a Complex Adaptive Environment. This\nspecification model is then used to develop an agent-based model of both the\nwireless sensor network as well as the environment. As proof of concept, we\ndemonstrate the application of FABS to a boids model of self-organized flocking\nof animals monitored by a random deployment of proximity sensors.\n", "  We perform quantum calculations of fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields\nin $AA$ collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. We find that in the quantum\npicture the field fluctuations are much smaller than predictions of the\nclassical Monte-Carlo simulation with the Woods-Saxon nuclear density.\n", "  In the context of stochastic two-phase flow in porous media, we introduce a\nnovel and efficient method to estimate the probability distribution of the\nwetting saturation field under uncertain rock properties in highly\nheterogeneous porous systems, where streamline patterns are dominated by\npermeability heterogeneity, and for slow displacement processes (viscosity\nratio close to unity). Our method, referred to as the frozen streamline\ndistribution method (FROST), is based on a physical understanding of the\nstochastic problem. Indeed, we identify key random fields that guide the\nwetting saturation variability, namely fluid particle times of flight and\ninjection times. By comparing saturation statistics against full-physics Monte\nCarlo simulations, we illustrate how this simple, yet accurate FROST method\nperforms under the preliminary approximation of frozen streamlines. Further, we\ninspect the performance of an accelerated FROST variant that relies on a\nsimplification about injection time statistics. Finally, we introduce how\nquantiles of saturation can be efficiently computed within the FROST framework,\nhence leading to robust uncertainty assessment.\n", "  The knowledge of effective masses is a key ingredient to analyze numerous\nproperties of semiconductors, like carrier mobilities, (magneto-)transport\nproperties, or band extrema characteristics yielding carrier densities and\ndensity of states. Currently, these masses are usually calculated using\nfinite-difference estimation of density functional theory (DFT) electronic band\ncurvatures. However, finite differences require an additional convergence study\nand are prone to numerical noise. Moreover, the concept of effective mass\nbreaks down at degenerate band extrema. We assess the former limitation by\ndeveloping a method that allows to obtain the Hessian of DFT bands directly,\nusing density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). Then, we solve the latter\nissue by adapting the concept of `transport equivalent effective mass' to the\n$\\vec{k} \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{p}}$ framework. The numerical noise inherent to\nfinite-difference methods is thus eliminated, along with the associated\nconvergence study. The resulting method is therefore more general, more robust\nand simpler to use, which makes it especially appropriate for high-throughput\ncomputing. After validating the developed techniques, we apply them to the\nstudy of silicon, graphane, and arsenic. The formalism is implemented into the\nABINIT software and supports the norm-conserving pseudopotential approach, the\nprojector augmented-wave method, and the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. The\nderived expressions also apply to the ultrasoft pseudopotential method.\n", "  A Si-based monolithic laser is highly desirable for full integration of\nSi-photonics. Lasing from direct bandgap group-IV GeSn alloy has opened a\ncompletely new venue from the traditional III-V integration approach. We\ndemonstrated optically pumped GeSn lasers on Si with broad wavelength coverage\nfrom 2 to 3 {\\mu}m. The GeSn alloys were grown using newly developed approaches\nwith an industry standard chemical vapor deposition reactor and low-cost\ncommercially available precursors. The achieved maximum Sn composition of 17.5%\nexceeded the generally acknowledged Sn incorporation limits for using similar\ndeposition chemistries. The highest lasing temperature was measured as 180 K\nwith the active layer thickness as thin as 260 nm. The unprecedented lasing\nperformance is mainly due to the unique growth approaches, which offer\nhigh-quality epitaxial materials. The results reported in this work show a\nmajor advance towards Si-based mid-infrared laser sources for integrated\nphotonics.\n", "  To realize nanomechanical graphene-based pressure and gas sensors, it is\nbeneficial to have a method to electrically readout the static displacement of\na suspended graphene membrane. Capacitive readout, typical in\nmicro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), gets increasingly challenging as one\nstarts shrinking the dimensions of these devices, since the expected\nresponsivity of such devices is below 0.1 aF/Pa. To overcome the challenges of\ndetecting small capacitance changes, we design an electrical readout device\nfabricated on top of an insulating quartz substrate, maximizing the\ncontribution of the suspended membrane to the total capacitance of the device.\nThe capacitance of the drum is further increased by reducing the gap size to\n110 nm. Using external pressure load, we demonstrate successful detection of\ncapacitance changes of a single graphene drum down to 50 aF, and pressure\ndifferences down to 25 mbar.\n", "  A Fermi liquid model for hadrons has been suggested for the hadrons in\nmedium. The hadrons are supposed to behave like quasi particle as Fermi\nexcitation while in the medium and the effective mass of the hadrons have been\nestimated using Fermi liquid model. Considering a momentum dependent potential\ninside the medium to describe the interaction, the effective masses of the\nhadrons are estimated. The temperature dependence of effective masses has also\nbeen studied. The possibility of describing masses of the quarks as Fermi\nexcitation has been investigated. Compressibility, specific heats, density of\nstates in medium has been studied. The potential depth for light and singly\nheavy baryons in medium has been extracted. The results are found to be very\ninteresting and compared with the other studies available in literature.\n", "  We study quantum correlations and discord in a bipartite continuous variable\nhybrid system formed by linear combinations of coherent states $|\\alpha\\rangle$\nand single photon added coherent states (SPACS) of the form\n$|\\psi\\rangle_{\\text{dp(pa)}}= \\mathcal{N}/\\sqrt{2} (\\hat{a}^\\dagger\n|\\alpha\\rangle_a |\\alpha\\rangle_b \\pm \\hat{b}^\\dagger |\\alpha\\rangle_a\n|\\alpha\\rangle_b)$. We stablish a relationship between the quantum discord with\na local observable (the quadrature variance for one sub-system) under the\ninfluence of scattering and phase fluctuation noise. For the pure states the\nquantum correlations are characterized by means of measurement induced\ndisturbance (MID) with simultaneous quadrature measurements. In a scenario\nwhere homodyne conditional measurements are available we show that the MID\nprovides an easy way to select optimal phases to obtain information of the\nmaximal correlations in the channels. The quantum correlations of these\nentangled states with channel losses are quantitatively characterized with the\nquantum discord (QD) with a displaced qubit projector. We observe that as\nscattering increases, QD decreases monotonically. At the same time for the\nstate $|\\psi\\rangle_{\\text{dp}}$, QD is more resistant to high phase\nfluctuations when the average photon number $n_0$ is bigger than zero, but if\nphase fluctuations are low, QD is more resistant if $n_0=0$. For the dp model\nwith scattering, we obtain an analytical expression of the QD as a function of\nthe observable quadrature variance in a local sub-system. This relation allows\nus to have a way to obtain the degree of QD in the channel by just measuring a\nlocal property observable such as the quadrature variance. For the other model\nthis relation still exists but is explored numerically. This relation is an\nimportant result that allows to identify quantum processing capabilities in\nterms of just local observables.\n", "  Dopant concentration and $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ phase fraction is studied in doped\nW thin films. Oxygen doped $\\beta$ W films are found to have 9.0~$\\pm$~0.9\nat.\\% of oxygen as measured from \\ac{SIMS}. Whereas, nitrogen doped $\\beta$ W\nfilms have 0.15~$\\pm$~0.02 at.\\% of nitrogen, much lower than the theoretically\npredicted value of 11 at.\\%. $\\beta$-W films partially phase transform to\n$\\alpha$ by annealing at 175~$^{\\circ}$C, up to maximum time of 72 hours. Weak\ndependence between dopant concentration and phase fraction is observed in the\nannealed films. The growth exponent of the phase transformation was calculated\nto be $<$1 in both the films, indicating a non-uniform nucleation of the\n$\\alpha$ phase.\n", "  Here we show a photonic design for tunable dual-wavelength generation\ndeploying optical nonlinear mode coupling of two coupled III-V semiconductor\nmicroring resonators (MRRs) connected to a pump and drop waveguide buses. Here\none of the two rings contains a grating, while the other has a planar surface.\nThe underling mechanism for the dual wavelength generation originates from the\nresonance-detuning of the spectra resulting in non-linear mode mixing.\nTunability of the wavelengths is achieved by altering the grating depth of the\nMRR and the power coupling coefficients. For the grating design of the MRR we\nselect a trapezoidal-profiled apodized grating to gain low reflectivity at\nsidelobes. A time-domain travelling wave (TDTW) analysis gives a InGaAsP core\nrefractive index of 3.3 surrounded by a grating InP cladding with n=3.2. We\nfurther confirm that the propagation of a Gaussian pulse input with 10 mW power\nand bandwidth of 0.76 ps is well confined within the mode propagation of the\nsystem. Taken together our results show a 2:1 fan-out of two spectrally\nseparate signals for compact and high functional sources on chip.\n", "  We study the bulk and surface nonlinear modes of the modified one-dimensional\ndiscrete nonlinear Schroedinger (mDNLS) equation. A linear and a modulational\nstability analysis of the lowest-order modes is carried out. While for the\nfundamental bulk mode there is no power threshold, the fundamental surface mode\nneeds a minimum power level to exist. Examination of the time evolution of\ndiscrete solitons in the limit of strongly localized modes, suggests ways to\nmanage the Peierls- Nabarro barrier, facilitating in this way a degree of\nsteering. The long-time propagation of an initially localized excitation shows\nthat, at long evolution times, nonlinear effects become negligible and as a\nresult, the propagation becomes ballistic. The similarity of all these results\nto the ones obtained for the DNLS equation, points out to the robustness of the\ndiscrete soliton phenomenology.\n", "  We theoretically study noise-induced phase switch phenomena in an inertial\nmajority-vote (IMV) model introduced in a recent paper [Phys. Rev. E 95, 042304\n(2017)]. The IMV model generates a strong hysteresis behavior as the noise\nintensity $f$ goes forward and backward, a main characteristic of a first-order\nphase transition, in contrast to a second-order phase transition in the\noriginal MV model. Using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation for the\nmaster equation, we reduce the problem to finding the zero-energy trajectories\nin an effective Hamiltonian system, and the mean switching time depends\nexponentially on the associated action and the number of particles $N$. Within\nthe hysteresis region, we find that the actions along the optimal forward\nswitching path from ordered phase (OP) to disordered phase (DP) and its\nbackward path, show distinct variation trends with $f$, and intersect at\n$f=f_c$ that determines the coexisting line of OP and DP. This results in a\nnonmonotonic dependence of the mean switching time between two symmetric OPs on\n$f$, with a minimum at $f_c$ for sufficiently large $N$. Finally, the\ntheoretical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  Tiered assessment is a differentiated assessment strategy where students can\nchoose to attempt advanced assessment tasks. We discuss the use of tiered\nassessment in second and third year electromagnetics courses.\n", "  Aharonov, Jones, and Landau [Algorithmica 55, 395 (2009)] have presented a\npolynomial quantum algorithm for approximating the Jones polynomial. We\ninvestigate the bipartite entanglement properties in AJL's algorithm for\nthree-strand braids. We re-describe AJL's algorithm as an equivalent algorithm\nwhich involves three work qubits in some mixed state coupled to a single\ncontrol qubit. Furthermore, we use the Peres entanglement criterion to study\nthe entanglement features of the state before measurements present in the\nre-described algorithm for all bipartitions. We show that the state is a\nproduct state relative to the bipartition between the first work qubit and the\nothers. And it has no entanglement between the control qubit and work ones. We\nalso prove a sufficient and necessary condition for its entanglement between\nthe second (third) work qubit and the others. Moreover, we discuss the relation\nbetween its bipartite entanglement and elementary crossings in the three-strand\nbraid group. We find that braids whose trace closures are topologically\nidentical may have different entanglement properties in AJL's algorithm.\n", "  In the theory of the Navier-Stokes equations, the viscous fluid in\nincompressible flow is modelled as a homogeneous and dense assemblage of\nconstituent \"fluid particles\" with viscous stress proportional to rate of\nstrain. The crucial concept of fluid flow is the velocity of the particle that\nis accelerated by the pressure and viscous interaction around it. In this\npaper, by virtue of the alternative constituent \"micro-finite element\", we\nintroduce a set of new intrinsic quantities, called the vortex fields, to\ncharacterise the relative orientation between elements and the feature of\nmicro-eddies in the element, while the description of viscous interaction in\nfluid returns to the initial intuition that the interlayer friction is\nproportional to the slip strength. Such a framework enables us to reconstruct\nthe dynamics theory of viscous fluid, in which the flowing fluid can be\nmodelled as a finite covering of elements and consequently indicated by a\nspace-time differential manifold that admits complex topological evolution.\n", "  The interactions between PM2.5 and meteorological factors play a crucial role\nin air pollution analysis. However, previous studies that have researched the\nrelationships between PM2.5 concentration and meteorological conditions have\nbeen mainly confined to a certain city or district, and the correlation over\nthe whole of China remains unclear. Whether or not spatial and seasonal\nvariations exit deserves further research. In this study, the relationships\nbetween PM2.5 concentration and meteorological factors were investigated in 74\nmajor cities in China for a continuous period of 22 months from February 2013\nto November 2014, at season, year, city, and regional scales, and the spatial\nand seasonal variations were analyzed. The meteorological factors were relative\nhumidity (RH), temperature (TEM), wind speed (WS), and surface pressure (PS).\nWe found that spatial and seasonal variations of their relationships with PM2.5\ndo exist. Spatially, RH is positively correlated with PM2.5 concentration in\nNorth China and Urumqi, but the relationship turns to negative in other areas\nof China. WS is negatively correlated with PM2.5 everywhere expect for Hainan\nIsland. PS has a strong positive relationship with PM2.5 concentration in\nNortheast China and Mid-south China, and in other areas the correlation is\nweak. Seasonally, the positive correlation between PM2.5 concentration and RH\nis stronger in winter and spring. TEM has a negative relationship with PM2.5 in\nautumn and the opposite in winter. PS is more positively correlated with PM2.5\nin autumn than in other seasons. Our study investigated the relationships\nbetween PM2.5 and meteorological factors in terms of spatial and seasonal\nvariations, and the conclusions about the relationships between PM2.5 and\nmeteorological factors are more comprehensive and precise than before.\n", "  Computational modelling has made many useful contributions to the field of\noptical tweezers. One aspect in which it can be applied is the simulation of\nthe dynamics of particles in optical tweezers. This can be useful for systems\nwith many degrees of freedom, and for the simulation of experiments. While\nmodelling of the optical force is a prerequisite for simulation of the motion\nof particles in optical traps, non-optical forces must also be included; the\nmost important are usually Brownian motion and viscous drag. We discuss some\napplications and examples of such simulations. We review the theory and\npractical principles of simulation of optical tweezers, including the choice of\nmethod of calculation of optical force, numerical solution of the equations of\nmotion of the particle, and finish with a discussion of a range of open\nproblems.\n", "  We investigate the effects of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a\nthree-orbital impurity model with Kanamori interaction using the numerical\nrenormalization group method. We focus on the impurity occupancy $N_d=2$\nrelevant to the dynamical mean-field theory studies of Hund's metals. Depending\non the strength of SOC $\\lambda$ we identify three regimes: usual Hund's\nimpurity for $|\\lambda|<\\lambda_c$, van-Vleck non-magnetic impurity for\n$\\lambda > \\lambda_c$, and a $J=2$ impurity for $\\lambda < -\\lambda_c$. They\nall correspond to a Fermi liquid but with very different quasiparticle phase\nshifts and different physical properties. The crossover between these regimes\nis controlled by an emergent scale, the orbital Kondo temperature, $\\lambda_c\n=T_K^\\mathrm{orb}$ that drops with increasing interaction strength. This\nimplies that oxides with strong electronic correlations are more prone to the\neffects of the spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  We look for possible (partial) compositeness properties of the bottom quark\naccording to the Composite Standard Model (CSM) concept in the same way this\nwas previously done for Higgs boson and top quark. After looking at the direct\nform factor effects appearing in $e^+e^-\\to b\\bar b$ we analyze the more\ncomplex features of the $e^+e^-, gg, \\gamma\\gamma \\to b\\bar b H, b\\bar b Z,\nt\\bar b W^-$ processes. We emphasize typical differences appearing between CSM\nconcerving and CSM violating cases. We also mention the possible appearence of\nan effective bottom mass.\n", "  We study a special case at which the analytical solution of the\nLippmann-Schwinger integral equation for the partial wave two-body Coulomb\ntransition matrix for likely charged particles at negative energy is possible.\nWith the use of the Fock's method of the stereographic projection of the\nmomentum space onto the four-dimensional unit sphere, the analytical\nexpressions for s-, p- and d-wave partial Coulomb transition matrices for\nrepulsively interacting particles at bound-state energy have been derived.\n", "  Satellite and ground-based observations are used to explore the composite\noceanic - atmospheric link known as the El Ni\\~no/La Ni\\~na Southern\nOscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, which is closely associated with extreme weather\nevents (e.g. heat waves, tornadoes, floods and droughts), incidence of epidemic\ndiseases (e.g. malaria), severe coral bleaching, etc. The ENSO temporal\nevolution depends on the energy exchange between the coupled ocean/atmosphere\nsystem. Its cycle has an average period of about four years, but there is\nconsiderable modulation of it from several sources and this is not yet fully\nunderstood. This paper aims to give a better insight to the global signature of\nENSO evolution considering both the continuous natural interactions taking\nplace between ocean and atmosphere, and anthropogenic effects. The results\nobtained could be employed to elucidate the development of more accurate\nadvanced modelling of ocean - atmosphere interactions, thereby improving\nclimate change projections.\n", "  It is typically assumed that the kinetic and magnetic helicities play a\ncrucial role in the growth of large-scale dynamo. In this paper we demonstrate\nthat helicity is not essential for the amplification of large-scale magnetic\nfield. For this purpose, we perform nonhelical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulation, and show that the large-scale magnetic field can grow in nonhelical\nMHD when random external forcing is employed at scale $1/10$ the box size. The\nenergy fluxes and shell-to-shell transfer rates computed using the numerical\ndata show that the large-scale magnetic energy grows due to the energy\ntransfers from the velocity field at the forcing scales.\n", "  We construct a five-mode helical dynamo model containing three velocity and\ntwo magnetic modes and solve it analytically. This model exhibits dynamo\ntransition via supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. We show that the critical\nmagnetic Reynolds number for dynamo transition ($\\mathrm{Rm}_c$) asymptotes to\nconstant values for very low and very high magnetic Prandtl numbers\n($\\mathrm{Pm}$). Beyond dynamo transition, secondary bifurcations lead to\nperiodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamo states as the forcing amplitude is\nincreased and chaos appears through a quasi-periodic route.\n", "  We have observed the well-kown quantum Hall effect (QHE) in epitaxial\ngraphene grown on silicon carbide (SiC) by using, for the first time, only\ncommercial NdFeB permanent magnets at low temperature. The relatively large and\nhomogeneous magnetic field generated by the magnets, together with the high\nquality of the epitaxial graphene films, enables the formation of\nwell-developed quantum Hall states at Landau level filling factors $\\nu=\\pm 2$,\ncommonly observed with superconducting electro-magnets. Furthermore, the\nchirality of the QHE edge channels can be changed by a top gate. These results\ndemonstrate that basic QHE physics are experimentally accessible in graphene\nfor a fraction of the price of conventional setups using superconducting\nmagnets, which greatly increases the potential of the QHE in graphene for\nresearch and applications.\n", "  Measuring the imprint of primordial gravitational waves in the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) polarisation field is one of the main goals in\nmodern cosmology. However, the so called $B$-mode polarisation can be generated\nby different sources besides the primary one predicted by inflationary\ntheories, known as secondary $B$-mode signal. Among them, CMB lensing and\nastrophysical foregrounds play an important role. Moreover, a partial sky\nanalysis leads to a leakage between $E$-modes and $B$-modes. In this article,\nwe use the well known Minkowski functionals (MF) statistics to study the\nsignificance of this leakage in the CMB lensing $B$-mode signal. We find that\nthe MF can detect the $E$-to-$B$ leakage contamination, thus it should not be\nneglected in future CMB data analysis.\n", "  In both WMAP and Planck observations on the temperature anisotropy of cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) radiation a number of large-scale anomalies were\ndiscovered in the past years, including the CMB parity asymmetry in the low\nmultipoles. By defining a directional statistics, we find that the CMB parity\nasymmetry is directional dependent, and the preferred axis is stable, which\nmeans that it is independent of the chosen CMB map, the definition of the\nstatistic, or the CMB masks. Meanwhile, we find that this preferred axis\nstrongly aligns with those of the CMB quadrupole, octopole, as well as those of\nother large-scale observations. In addition, all of them aligns with the CMB\nkinematic dipole, which hints to the non-cosmological origin of these\ndirectional anomalies in cosmological observations.\n", "  We suggest a novel approach for wide-field imaging of the neural network\ndynamics of brain slices that uses highly sensitivity magnetometry based on\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. In-vitro recordings in brain slices\nis a proven method for the characterization of electrical neural activity and\nhas strongly contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms that govern\nneural information processing. However, traditional recordings can only acquire\nsignals from a few positions simultaneously, which severely limits their\nability to characterize the dynamics of the underlying neural networks. We\nsuggest to radically extend the scope of this method using the wide-field\nimaging of the neural magnetic fields across the slice by means of NV\nmagnetometry. Employing comprehensive computational simulations and theoretical\nanalyses, we characterize the spatiotemporal characteristics of the neural\nmagnetic fields and derive the required key performance parameters of an\nimaging setup based on NV magnetometry. In particular, we determine how the\ntechnical parameters determine the achievable spatial resolution for an optimal\nreconstruction of the neural currents from the measured field distributions.\nFinally, we compare the imaging of neural slice activity with that of a single\nplanar pyramidal cell. Our results suggest that imaging of neural slice\nactivity will be possible with the upcoming generation of NV magnetic field\nsensors, while imaging of the activity of a single planar cell remains more\nchallenging.\n", "  The initial mass function for the stars is often modeled by a lognormal\ndistribution. This paper is devoted to demonstrating the advantage of\nintroducing a left and right truncated lognormal probability density function,\nwhich is characterized by four parameters. Its normalization constant, mean,\nthe variance, second moment about the origin and distribution function are\ncalculated. The chi-square test and the Kolmogorov--Smirnov test are performed\non four samples of stars.\n", "  Our study exploits the Constant Intensity Cut principles applied\nsimultaneously to muonic and electromagnetic detectors of cosmic rays. We use\nthe fact that the ordering of events according to their signal sizes induced in\ndifferent types of surface detectors provides information about the mass\ncomposition of primary cosmic-ray beam, with low sensitivity to details of\nhadronic interactions. Composition analysis at knee energies is performed using\nMonte Carlo simulations for extensive air showers having maxima located far\naway from a hypothetical observatory. Another type of a hypothetical\nobservatory is adopted to examine composition of ultra-high energy primaries\nwhich initiate vertical air showers with maxima observed near surface\ndetectors.\n", "  In this paper, we consider a system of a massless Klein-Gordon field coupled\nto a static source. The total Hamiltonian is a self-adjoint operator on a boson\nFock space. We consider annihilation operators in the Heisenberg picture and\ndefine a sesquilinear form. Under infrared regularity conditions, it is proven\nthat the sesquilinear form is a solution of the classical field equation.\n", "  We study the partitioning of cosolute particles in a thin film of a\nsemi-flexible polymer network by a combination of coarse-grained\n(implicit-solvent) stochastic dynamics simulations and mean-field theory. We\nfocus on a wide range of solvent qualities and cosolute-network interactions\nfor selected polymer flexibilities. Our investigated ensemble\n(isothermal-isobaric) allows the network to undergo a volume transition from\nextended to collapsed state while the cosolutes can distribute in bulk and\nnetwork, correspondingly. We find a rich topology of equilibrium states of the\nnetwork and transitions between them, qualitatively depending on solvent\nquality, polymer flexibility, and cosolute-network interactions. In particular,\nwe find a novel `cosolute-induced' collapsed state, where strongly attractive\ncosolutes bridge network monomers albeit the latter interact mutually\nrepulsive. Finally, the cosolutes' global partitioning `landscape', computed as\na function of solvent quality and cosolute-network interactions, exhibits very\ndifferent topologies depending on polymer flexibility. The simulation results\nare supported by theoretical predictions obtained with a two-component\nmean-field approximation for the Helmholtz free energy that considers the chain\nelasticity and the particle interactions in terms of a virial expansion. Our\nfindings have implications on the interpretation of transport processes and\npermeability in hydrogel films, as realized in filtration or macromolecular\ncarrier systems.\n", "  We have explored the outskirts of dark matter haloes out to 2.5 times the\nvirial radius using a large sample of halos drawn from Illustris, along with a\nset of zoom simulations (MUGS). Using these, we make a systematic exploration\nof the shape profile beyond R$_{vir}$. In the mean sphericity profile of\nIllustris halos we identify a dip close to the virial radius, which is robust\nacross a broad range of masses and infall rates. The inner edge of this feature\nmay be related to the virial radius and the outer edge with the splashback\nradius. Due to the high halo-to-halo variation this result is visible only on\naverage. However, in four individual halos in the MUGS sample, a decrease in\nthe sphericity and a subsequent recovery is evident close to the splashback\nradius. We find that this feature persists for several Gyr, growing with the\nhalo. This feature appears at the interface between the spherical halo density\ndistribution and the filamentary structure in the environment. The shape\nfeature is strongest when there is a high rate of infall, implying that the\neffect is due to the mixing of accreting and virializing material. The\nfilamentary velocity field becomes rapidly mixed in the halo region inside the\nvirial radius, with the area between this and the splashback radius serving as\nthe transition region. We also identify a long-lasting and smoothly evolving\nsplashback region in the radial density gradient in many of the MUGS halos.\n", "  It is shown that the universal steady Euler flow field, independent of\nboundary shape or symmetry, in a toroidal domain with fixed boundary obeys a\nnonlinear Beltrami equation, with the nonlinearity arising from a\nBoltzmann-like, velocity-dependent factor. Moreover, this is a relaxed velocity\nfield, in the sense that it extremizes the total kinetic energy in the domain\nunder free variations of the velocity field, constrained only by tangential\nvelocity and vorticity boundary conditions and conservation of total fluid\nhelicity and entropy. This is analogous to Woltjer-Taylor relaxation of plasma\nmagnetic field to a stationary state. However, unlike the magnetic field case,\nattempting to derive slow, quasi-relaxed dynamics from Hamilton's action\nprinciple, with constant total fluid helicity as a constraint, fails to agree,\nin the static limit, with the nonlinear Beltrami solution of the Euler\nequations. Nevertheless, an action principle that gives a quasi-relaxed\ndynamics that does agree can be formulated, by introducing a potential\nrepresentation of the velocity field and defining an analogue of the magnetic\nhelicity as a new constraint. A Hamiltonian form of quasi-relaxed fluid\ndynamics is also given.\n", "  The textbook thermophoretic force which acts on a body in a fluid is\nproportional to the local temperature gradient. The same is expected to hold\nfor the macroscopic drift behavior of a diffusive cluster or molecule\nphysisorbed on a solid surface. The question we explore here is whether that is\nstill valid on a 2D membrane such as graphene at short sheet length. By means\nof a non-equilibrium molecular dynamics study of a test system -- a gold\nnanocluster adsorbed on free-standing graphene clamped between two temperatures\n$\\Delta T$ apart -- we find a phoretic force which for submicron sheet lengths\nis parallel to, but basically independent of, the local gradient magnitude.\nThis identifies a thermophoretic regime that is ballistic rather than\ndiffusive, persisting up to and beyond a hundred nanometer sheet length.\nAnalysis shows that the phoretic force is due to the flexural phonons, whose\nflow is known to be ballistic and distance-independent up to relatively long\nmean-free paths. Yet, ordinary harmonic phonons should only carry crystal\nmomentum and, while impinging on the cluster, should not be able to impress\nreal momentum. We show that graphene, and other membrane-like monolayers,\nsupport a specific anharmonic connection between the flexural corrugation and\nlongitudinal phonons whose fast escape leaves behind a 2D-projected mass\ndensity increase endowing the flexural phonons, as they move with their group\nvelocity, with real momentum, part of which is transmitted to the adsorbate\nthrough scattering. The resulting distance-independent ballistic thermophoretic\nforce is not unlikely to possess practical applications.\n", "  The existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life forms among the thousands\nof billions of galaxies that dance in the Universe is beyond doubt. Meeting\nwith one of them is only a matter of time. SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial\nIntelligence) has been searching for them for only half a century. However, the\ncrucial question today is whether we will have time to establish contact given\nthe multiple threats that humanity puts on itself. Therefore, it seems urgent\nto launch a program complementary to SETI which could be called STI (Search for\nTerrestrial Intelligence).\n", "  Due to their broad spectral width, ultrashort lasers provide new\npossibilities to shape light beams and control their properties, in particular\nthrough the use of spatio-temporal couplings. In this context, we present a\ntheoretical investigation of the linear propagation of ultrashort laser beams\nthat combine temporal chirp and a standard aberration known as longitudinal\nchromatism. When such beams are focused in a vacuum, or in a linear medium, the\ninterplay of these two effects can be exploited to set the velocity of the\nresulting intensity peak to arbitrary values within the Rayleigh length, i.e.\nprecisely where laser pulses are generally used. Such beams could find\ngroundbreaking applications in the control of laser-matter interactions, in\nparticular for laser-driven particle acceleration.\n", "  One of the varieties of pores, often found in natural or artificial building\nmaterials, are the so-called blind pores of dead-end or saccate type.\nThree-dimensional model of such kind of pore has been developed in this work.\nThis model has been used for simulation of water vapor interaction with\nindividual pore by molecular dynamics in combination with the diffusion\nequation method. Special investigations have been done to find dependencies\nbetween thermostats implementations and conservation of thermodynamic and\nstatistical values of water vapor - pore system. The two types of evolution of\nwater-pore system have been investigated: drying and wetting of the pore. Full\nresearch of diffusion coefficient, diffusion velocity and other diffusion\nparameters has been made.\n", "  In the present work, we studied the q-deformed Morse and harmonic oscillator\nsystems with appropriate canonical commutation algebra. The analytic solutions\nfor eigenfunctions and energy eigenvalues are worked out using time-independent\nSchrodinger equation and It is also noted that these wave functions are\nsensitive to variation in the parameters involved.\n", "  A new exact solution of Einstein's field equations on the background of\nparaboloidal spacetime using Karmarkar condition is reported. The physical\nacceptability conditions of the model are investigated and found that the model\nis compatible with a number of compact star candidates like Her X-1, LMC X-4,\nEXO 1785-248, PSR J1903+327, Vela X-1 and PSR J1614-2230. A noteworthy feature\nof the model is that it is geometrically significant and simple in form.\n", "  In search of a reliable methodology for the prediction of light absorption\nand emission of Ce$^{3+}$-doped luminescent materials, 13 representative\nmaterials are studied with first-principles and semiempirical approaches. In\nthe first-principles approach, that combines constrained density-functional\ntheory and $\\Delta$SCF, the atomic positions are obtained for both ground and\nexcited states of the Ce$^{3+}$ ion. The structural information is fed into\nDorenbos' semiempirical model. Absorption and emission energies are calculated\nwith both methods and compared with experiment. The first-principles approach\nmatches experiment within 0.3 eV, with two exceptions at 0.5 eV. In contrast,\nthe semiempirical approach does not perform as well (usually more than 0.5 eV\nerror). The general applicability of the present first-principles scheme, with\nan encouraging predictive power, opens a novel avenue for crystal site\nengineering and high-throughput search for new phosphors and scintillators.\n", "  We have extended the biquaternionic Dirac's equation to include interactions\nwith photons. The electric field is found to be perpendicular to the matter\nmagnetic field, and the magnetic field is perpendicular to the matter inertial\nfield. Inertial and magnetic masses are found to be conserved separately. The\nmagnetic mass density is a consequence of the coupling between the vector\npotential and the matter inertial field. The presence of the vector and scalar\npotentials, and the matter inertial and magnetic fields are found to modify the\nstandard form of the derived Maxwell's equations. The resulting interacting\nelectrodynamics equations are found to generalize those of axion-like fields of\nFrank Wilczek or Chern-Simons equations. The axion field satisfies massive\nKlein-Gordon equation if Lorenz gauge condition is violated. Therefore, axion\ncould be our massive photon. The electromagnetic field vector,\n$\\vec{F}=\\vec{E}+ic\\vec{B}$, is found to satisfy massive Dirac's equation in\naddition to the fact that $\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{F}=0$, where $\\vec{E}$ and\n$\\vec{B}$ are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively.\n", "  Superconducting detectors are now well-established tools for low-light\noptics, and in particular quantum optics, boasting high-efficiency, fast\nresponse and low noise. Similarly, lithium niobate is an important platform for\nintegrated optics given its high second-order nonlinearity, used for high-speed\nelectro-optic modulation and polarization conversion, as well as frequency\nconversion and sources of quantum light. Combining these technologies addresses\nthe requirements for a single platform capable of generating, manipulating and\nmeasuring quantum light in many degrees of freedom, in a compact and\npotentially scalable manner. We will report on progress integrating tungsten\ntransition-edge sensors (TESs) and amorphous tungsten silicide superconducting\nnanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) on titanium in-diffused lithium\nniobate waveguides. The travelling-wave design couples the evanescent field\nfrom the waveguides into the superconducting absorber. We will report on\nsimulations and measurements of the absorption, which we can characterize at\nroom temperature prior to cooling down the devices. Independently, we show how\nthe detectors respond to flood illumination, normally incident on the devices,\ndemonstrating their functionality.\n", "  We model the spread of news as a social learning game on a network. Agents\ncan either endorse or oppose a claim made in a piece of news, which itself may\nbe either true or false. Agents base their decision on a private signal and\ntheir neighbors' past actions. Given these inputs, agents follow strategies\nderived via multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and receive utility from\nacting in accordance with the veracity of claims. Our framework yields\nstrategies with agent utility close to a theoretical, Bayes optimal benchmark,\nwhile remaining flexible to model re-specification. Optimized strategies allow\nagents to correctly identify most false claims, when all agents receive\nunbiased private signals. However, an adversary's attempt to spread fake news\nby targeting a subset of agents with a biased private signal can be successful.\nEven more so when the adversary has information about agents' network position\nor private signal. When agents are aware of the presence of an adversary they\nre-optimize their strategies in the training stage and the adversary's attack\nis less effective. Hence, exposing agents to the possibility of fake news can\nbe an effective way to curtail the spread of fake news in social networks. Our\nresults also highlight that information about the users' private beliefs and\ntheir social network structure can be extremely valuable to adversaries and\nshould be well protected.\n", "  The astronomical community continues to be interested in suitable\nprogrammable slit masks for use in multi-object spectrometers (MOSs) on space\nmissions. There have been ground-based MOS utilizing digital micromirror\ndevices (DMDs) and they have proven to be highly accurate and reliable\ninstruments. This paper summarizes the results of a continuing study to\ninvestigate the performance of DMDs under conditions associated with space\ndeployment. This includes the response of DMDs to radiation, to the vibration\nand mechanical shock loads associated with launch, and the operability of DMD\nunder cryogenic temperatures. The optical contrast ratio and a study of the\nlong-term reflectance of a bare device have also been investigated. The results\nof the radiation testing demonstrate that DMDs in orbit would experience\nnegligible heavy-ion induced single event upset (SEU) rate burden, we predict\nSEU rate of 5.6 micromirrors per 24 hours. Vibration and mechanical shock\ntesting was performed according to the NASA General Environmental Verification\nStandard (GEVS), no mirrors failed in the devices tested. The results of low\ntemperature testing suggest that DMDs are not affected by the thermal load and\noperate smoothly at temperatures at least as low as 78 K. The reflectivity of a\nbare DMD did not measurably change even after being exposed to ambient\nconditions over a period of 13 months. The measured contrast ratio (on state vs\noff state of the DMD micromirrors) was greater than 6000/:1 when illuminated\nwith an f/4 optical beam. Overall, DMDs are extremely robust and promise to\nprovide a reliable alternative to micro shutter arrays (MSA) to be used in\nspace as remotely programmable slit masks for MOS design.\n", "  Gyrokinetic theory is a basis for treating magnetised plasma dynamics slower\nthan particle gyrofrequencies where the scale of the background is larger than\nrelevant gyroradii. The energy of field perturbations can be comparable to the\nthermal energy but smaller than the energy of the background magnetic field.\nProperly applied, it is a low-frequency gauge transform rather than a treatment\nof particle orbits, and more a representation in terms of gyrocenters rather\nthan particles than an approximation. By making all transformations and\napproximations in the field/particle Lagrangian one preserves exact energetic\nconsistency so that time symmetry ensures energy conservation and spatial\naxisymmetry ensures toroidal angular momentum conservation. This method draws\non earlier experience with drift kinetic models while showing the independence\nof gyrokinetic representation from particularities of Lie transforms or\nspecific ordering limits, and that the essentials of low-frequency\nmagnetohydrodynamics, including the equilibrium, are recovered. It gives a\nuseful basis for total-f electromagnetic gyrokinetic computation. Various\nversions of the representation based upon choice of parallel velocity space\ncoordinate are illustrated.\n", "  We consider capillary condensation transitions occurring in open slits of\nwidth $L$ and finite height $H$ immersed in a reservoir of vapour. In this case\nthe pressure at which condensation occurs is closer to saturation compared to\nthat occurring in an infinite slit ($H=\\infty$) due to the presence of two\nmenisci which are pinned near the open ends. Using macroscopic arguments we\nderive a modified Kelvin equation for the pressure, $p_{cc}(L;H)$, at which\ncondensation occurs and show that the two menisci are characterised by an edge\ncontact angle $\\theta_e$ which is always larger than the equilibrium contact\nangle $\\theta$, only equal to it in the limit of macroscopic $H$. For walls\nwhich are completely wet ($\\theta=0$) the edge contact angle depends only on\nthe aspect ratio of the capillary and is well described by $\\theta_e\\approx\n\\sqrt{\\pi L/2H}$ for large $H$. Similar results apply for condensation in\ncylindrical pores of finite length. We have tested these predictions against\nnumerical results obtained using a microscopic density functional model where\nthe presence of an edge contact angle characterising the shape of the menisci\nis clearly visible from the density profiles. Below the wetting temperature\n$T_w$ we find very good agreement for slit pores of widths of just a few tens\nof molecular diameters while above $T_w$ the modified Kelvin equation only\nbecomes accurate for much larger systems.\n", "  A tabletop low-noise differential amplifer with a bandwidth of 100 kHz is\npresented. Low voltage drifts of the order of 100 nV/day are reached by\nthermally stabilizing relevant amplifer components. The input leakage current\nis below 100 fA. Input-stage errors are reduced by extensive circuitry. Voltage\nnoise, current noise, input capacitance and input current are extraordinarily\nlow. The input resistance is larger than 1 TOhm. The amplifers were tested with\nand deployed for electrical transport measurements of quantum devices at\ncryogenic temperatures.\n", "  A model of the oscillatory component of interaction of inner boundaries is\nstudied; and the features of generation of the composite structure in interim\nasymptotics are considered. A model of a multiscale net of inner boundaries was\nused to obtain analytical expressions for calculating the force fields of the\nSierpinski prefractal and its modifications.\n", "  Zero-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provides complementary analysis\nmodalities to those of high-field NMR and allows for ultra-high-resolution\nspectroscopy and measurement of untruncated spin-spin interactions. Unlike for\nthe high-field case, however, universal quantum control -- the ability to\nperform arbitrary unitary operations -- has not been experimentally\ndemonstrated in zero-field NMR. This is because the Larmor frequency for all\nspins is identically zero at zero field, making it challenging to individually\naddress different spin species. We realize a composite-pulse technique for\narbitrary independent rotations of $^1$H and $^{13}$C spins in a two-spin\nsystem. Quantum-information-inspired randomized benchmarking and state\ntomography are used to evaluate the quality of the control. We experimentally\ndemonstrate single-spin control for $^{13}$C with an average gate fidelity of\n$0.9960(2)$ and two-spin control via a controlled-not (CNOT) gate with an\nestimated fidelity of $0.99$. The combination of arbitrary single-spin gates\nand a CNOT gate is sufficient for universal quantum control of the nuclear spin\nsystem. The realization of complete spin control in zero-field NMR is an\nessential step towards applications to quantum simulation,\nentangled-state-assisted quantum metrology, and zero-field NMR spectroscopy.\n", "  We consider a class of non-equilibrium pure states, which are generally\npresent in an isolated quantum statistical system. These are states of the form\n$|\\Psi\\rangle=e^{-{\\beta H \\over 2}} U e^{{\\beta H \\over 2}} |\\Psi_0\\rangle$,\nwhere $U$ is a unitary made out of simple operators and $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$ is a\ntypical equilibrium pure state with sharply peaked energy. We argue that in a\nsystem with a holographic dual these states have a natural interpretation as an\nAdS black hole with transient excitations behind the horizon. We explore the\ninterpretation of these states as pure states undergoing a time-dependent\nspontaneous fluctuation out of equilibrium. While these states are atypical and\nthe microscopic phases of the wavefunction are correlated with the matrix\nelements of simple operators, the states are partly disguised as equilibrium\nstates due to cancellations between contributions from different coarse-grained\nenergy bins. These cancellations are guaranteed by the KMS condition of the\nunderlying equilibrium state $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$. However, in correlators which\ninclude the Hamiltonian $H$ these cancellations are spoiled and the\nnon-equilibrium nature of the state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ can be detected. We discuss\nconnections with the proposal that local observables behind the horizon are\nrealized as state-dependent operators. The states studied in this paper may be\nuseful for implementing an analogue of the \"traversable wormhole\" protocol for\na 1-sided black hole, which could potentially allow us to extract the\nexcitation from behind the horizon. We include some pedagogical background\nmaterial.\n", "  Voltage control effects provide an energy-efficient means of tailoring\nmaterial properties, especially in highly integrated nanoscale devices.\nHowever, only insulating and semiconducting systems can be controlled so far.\nIn metallic systems, there is no electric field due to electron screening\neffects and thus no such control effect exists. Here we demonstrate that\nmetallic systems can also be controlled electrically through ionic not\nelectronic effects. In a Pt/Co structure, the control of the metallic Pt/Co\ninterface can lead to unprecedented control effects on the magnetic properties\nof the entire structure. Consequently, the magnetization and perpendicular\nmagnetic anisotropy of the Co layer can be independently manipulated to any\ndesired state, the efficient spin toques can be enhanced about 3.5 times, and\nthe switching current can be reduced about one order of magnitude. This ability\nto control a metallic system may be extended to control other physical\nphenomena.\n", "  A stress is applied at the flat face and the apex of a prismatic\npiezoelectric crystal. The voltage generated at these points differs in order\nof magnitude. The result may be used to nondestructively test the uniformity of\nsurfaces of piezoelectric crystals.\n"]}
