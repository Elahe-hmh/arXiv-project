This incorporates a top-down approach that implements\na system-level criterion based on specification of the full system dynamics,\napplied at every level of error correction concatenation. This leads to more\naccurate determinations of error thresholds than could previously be obtained.\nThis is demonstrated both formally and with an explicit numerical example. The\nbasis for our approach is the Quantum Computer Condition (QCC), an inequality\ngoverning the evolution of a quantum computer. We show that all known coding\nschemes are actually special cases of the QCC. We demonstrate this by\nintroducing a new, operator theoretic form of entanglement assisted quantum\nerror correction, which incorporates as special cases all known error\ncorrecting protocols, and is itself a special case of the QCC.\n", "  We study some collective phenomena that may happen in a multiverse scenario.\nFirst, it is posed an interaction scheme between universes whose evolution is\ndominated by a cosmological constant. As a result of the interaction, the value\nof the cosmological constant of one of the universes becomes very close to zero\nat the expense of an increasing value of the cosmological constant of the\npartner universe. Second, we found normal modes for a 'chain' of interacting\nuniverses. The energy spectrum of the multiverse, being this taken as a\ncollective system, splits into a large number of levels, some of which\ncorrespond to a value of the cosmological constant very close to zero. We\nfinally point out that the multiverse may be much more than the mere sum of its\nparts.\n", "  The third quantization formalism of quantum cosmology adds simplicity and\nconceptual insight into the quantum description of the multiverse. Within such\na formalism, the existence of squeezed and entangled states raises the question\nof whether the complementary principle of quantum mechanics has to be extended\nto the quantum description of the whole space-time manifold. If so, the\n'particle' description entails the consideration of a multiverse scenario and\nthe 'wave' description induces us to consider as well correlations and\ninteractions among the universes of the multiverse.\n", "  Inter-universal entanglement may even exist in a multiverse in which there is\nno common space-time among the universes. In particular, the entanglement\nbetween the expanding and contracting branches of the universe might have\nobservable consequences in the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of one\nsingle branch, making therefore testable the whole multiverse proposal, at\nleast in principle.\n", "  The creation of universes in entangled pairs may avoid the initial\nsingularity and it would have observable consequences in a large macroscopic\nuniverse like ours, at least in principle. In this paper we describe the\ncreation of an entangled pair of universes from a double instanton, which\navoids the initial singularity, in the case of a homogeneous and isotropic\nuniverse with a conformally coupled massless scalar field. The thermodynamical\nproperties of inter-universal entanglement might have observable consequences\non the properties of our single universe provided that the thermodynamics of\nentanglement is eventually related to the classical formulation of\nthermodynamics.\n", "  We investigate the inclusive Higgs boson production in proton-proton\ncollisions at high energies in the framework of kt-factorization QCD approach.\nThe attention is focused on the dominant off-shell gluon-gluon fusion\nsubprocess, where the transverse momentum of incoming gluons are taken into\naccount. The transverse momentum dependent (or unintegrated) gluon densities of\nthe proton are determined using the CCFM evolution equation as well as the\nKimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription. We study the theoretical uncertainties of\nour calculations and perform the comparison with the results of traditional\npQCD evaluations. Our predictions agree well with the first experimental data\ntaken by the ATLAS collaboration at the LHC. We argue that further studies of\nthe Higgs boson production are capable of constraining the unintegrated gluon\ndensities of the proton.\n", "  With Gaia in orbit since December 2013 it is time to look at the future of\nfundamental astrometry and a time frame of 50 years is needed in this matter. A\nspace mission with Gaia-like astrometric performance is required, but not\nnecessarily a Gaia-like satellite. It should be studied whether this can be\nobtained within the budget of a medium-size ESA mission. A dozen science issues\nfor a Gaia successor mission in twenty years, with launch about 2033, are\npresented and in this context also other possibilities for absolute astrometry\nwith milliarcsecond (mas) or sub-mas accuracies are discussed. The three\npowerful techniques: VLBI, the MICADO camera on the E-ELT, and the LSST are\ndescribed and documented by literature references and by an extensive\ncorrespondence with leading astronomers who readily responded with all the\ninformation I needed. In brief, the two Gaia-like missions would provide an\nastrometric foundation for all branches of astronomy from the solar system and\nstellar systems, including exo-planet systems, to compact galaxies, quasars and\ndark matter (DM) substructures by data which cannot be surpassed in the next 50\nyears. - In April 2017 ESA selected our proposal Hobbs et al. (2016) for study\nof a detector with NIR sensitivity for a Gaia successor mission, called\nGaiaNIR.\n", "  Astrometric issues for solar system studies are discussed. An overview gives\nreferences and cover all aspects of the solar system where astrometry is\nimportant: orbits of planets, moons, asteroids and NEOs, masses of asteroids,\noccultations of asteroids and KBOs, and families of asteroids and KBOs. The\nroles of astrometry from the ground, from Gaia and from a Gaia successor are\ndiscussed, but not small-field astrometry from space. It appears from work with\nCCD cameras at the 1.55 m astrometric reflector in Flagstaff that an accuracy\nof 1 mas is the best possible from the ground during one night observing when\nusing ordinary telescopes, i.e. without wave-front correctors, and for field\nsizes larger than 2 arcmin. It has been seen that the same accuracies can be\nreached with the much larger 4-m class telescope on Hawaii although it is not\nspecifically designed for astrometry. The accuracy of 1 mas from the ground\nrefers mainly to non-moving point sources, but it is expected that 1 mas can be\nreached from the ground for solar system bodies from many nights of\nobservations when phase effects are taken into account.\n", "  If we apply the path integral formulation in order to analyze the particle\ncreation process of black-holes inside the non-linear formulation of massive\ngravity, it is possible to demonstrate that the effect of the extra-degrees of\nfreedom is to deform the periodicity of the poles of the propagator in the\ncomplex $t$-plane. This might create the effect of extra-particle creation\nprocess at scales where the extra-degrees of freedom become relevant. For\nstationary solutions, depending on the values taken by the free parameters of\nthe theory, the periodicity structure of the propagator reveal two effects. The\nfirst one is a shift on the positions of the pole of the propagator with\nrespect to the GR case, affecting then the instant at which the particles are\ndetected. The second one is the existence of branch points, affecting then the\nperception of particles. The branch point can be finite (including the zero\norder case) or infinite depending on the free-parameters of the theory.\n", "  The study of nuclei farther from the valley of $\\beta$-stability goes\nhand-in-hand with shorter-lived nuclei produced in smaller abundances than\ntheir more stable counterparts. The measurement, to high precision, of nuclear\nmasses therefore requires innovations in technique in order to keep up.\nTRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science (TITAN) facility deploys three\nion traps, with a fourth in the commissioning phase, to perform and support\nPenning trap mass spectrometry and in-trap decay spectroscopy on some of the\nshortest-lived nuclei ever studied. We report on recent advances and updates to\nthe TITAN facility since the 2012 EMIS Conference.\n  TITAN's charge breeding capabilities have been improved and in-trap decay\nspectroscopy can be performed in TITAN's electron beam ion trap (EBIT). Higher\ncharge states can improve the precision of mass measurements, reduce the\nbeam-time requirements for a given measurement, improve beam purity and opens\nthe door to access, via in-trap decay and recapture, isotopes not available\nfrom the ISOL method. This was recently demonstrated during TITAN's mass\nmeasurement of $^{30}$Al. The EBIT's decay spectroscopy setup was commissioned\nwith a successful branching ratio and half-life measurement of $^{124}$Cs.\n  Charge breeding in the EBIT increases the energy spread of the ion bunch sent\nto the Penning trap for mass measurement so a new Cooler Penning Trap (CPET),\nwhich aims to cool highly charge ions with an electron plasma, is undergoing\nonline commissioning. Already, CPET has demonstrated the trapping and\nself-cooling of a room-temperature electron plasma which was stored for several\nminutes. A new detector has been installed inside the CPET magnetic field which\nwill allow for in-magnet charged particle detection.\n", "  We study the direct and inverse scattering problem for the one-dimensional\nSchr\\\"odinger equation with steplike potentials. We give necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the scattering data to correspond to a potential with\nprescribed smoothness and prescribed decay to their asymptotics. These results\nare important for solving the Korteweg-de Vries equation via the inverse\nscattering transform.\n", "  We show that the long-time behavior of solutions to the Korteweg-de Vries\nshock problem can be described as a slowly modulated one-gap solution in the\ndispersive shock region. The modulus of the elliptic function (i.e., the\nspectrum of the underlying Schr\\\"odinger operator) depends only on the size of\nthe step of the initial data and on the direction, $\\frac{x}{t}=const.$, along\nwhich we determine the asymptotic behavior of the solution. In turn, the phase\nshift (i.e., the Dirichlet spectrum) in this elliptic function depends also on\nthe scattering data, and is computed explicitly via the Jacobi inversion\nproblem.\n", "  The concept of local fractional derivative was introduced in order to be able\nto study the local scaling behavior of functions. However it has turned out to\nbe much more useful. It was found that simple equations involving these\noperators naturally incorporate the fractal sets into the equations. Here, the\nscope of these equations has been extended further by considering different\npossibilities for the known function. We have also studied a separable local\nfractional differential equation along with its method of solution.\n", "  This is a personal account of how I became an astronomer. Fascinated by the\nstars and planets in the dark sky over Lolland, an island 100 km south of\nCopenhagen, the interest in astronomy was growing. Encouraged by my teachers, I\npolished mirrors and built telescopes with generous help from the local\nblacksmith and I observed light curves of variable stars. Studies at the\nCopenhagen University from 1950 gradually led me deeper into astronomy,\nespecially astrometry (the astronomy of positions), guided by professor Bengt\nStr\\\"omgren and my mentor dr. phil. Peter Naur. I was lucky to take part in the\nbuildup of the new observatory at Brorfelde during the first difficult years\nand the ideas I gathered there have contributed to the two astrometry\nsatellites Hipparcos and Gaia launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) in\nrespectively 1989 and 2013.\n", "  The Baltic meetings of astronomers from Northern Germany and Scandinavia\nbegan in 1957 and gathered up to 70 participants. Reports of the presentations\nare available from all meetings, providing an overview of the interests of\nastronomers in this part of the world 50 years ago. Most interesting to see for\na young astronomer in our days, I think, is that a large part of the time was\nabout astrometry. This focus on astrometry was the basis for the scientific\nknowhow which made the idea of space astrometry realistic, resulting in the\napproval by ESA of the first astrometry satellite Hipparcos in 1980 which\nbrought a revolution of high-precision astrometry of positions, motions and\ndistances of stars. The correspondence with ten observatories shows that only\none of them has any archive of letters at all from the 1950s, that is in\nCopenhagen where about 7000 letters on scientific and administrative matters\nare extant. - These letters have now been stored in the Rigsarkivet.\n", "  The analysis of data sets arising from multiple sensors has drawn significant\nresearch attention over the years. Traditional methods, including kernel-based\nmethods, are typically incapable of capturing nonlinear geometric structures.\nWe introduce a latent common manifold model underlying multiple sensor\nobservations for the purpose of multimodal data fusion. A method based on\nalternating diffusion is presented and analyzed; we provide theoretical\nanalysis of the method under the latent common manifold model. To exemplify the\npower of the proposed framework, experimental results in several applications\nare reported.\n", "  The formation of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is an unavoidable\noutcome of galaxy evolution via successive mergers. However, the mechanism that\ndrives their orbital evolution from parsec separations down to the\ngravitational wave (GW) dominated regime is poorly understood, and their final\nfate is still unclear. If such binaries are embedded in gas-rich and turbulent\nenvironments, as observed in remnants of galaxy mergers, the interaction with\ngas clumps (such as molecular clouds) may efficiently drive their orbital\nevolution. Using numerical simulations, we test this hypothesis by studying the\ndynamical evolution of an equal-mass, circular MBHB accreting infalling\nmolecular clouds. We investigate different orbital configurations, modelling a\ntotal of 13 systems to explore different possible impact parameters and\nrelative inclinations of the cloud-binary encounter. We focus our study on the\nprompt, transient phase during the first few orbits when the dynamical\nevolution of the binary is fastest, finding that this evolution is dominated by\nthe exchange of angular momentum through gas capture by the individual black\nholes and accretion. Building on these results, we construct a simple model for\nevolving a MBHB interacting with a sequence of clouds, which are randomly drawn\nfrom reasonable populations with different levels of anisotropy in their\nangular momenta distributions. We show that the binary efficiently evolves down\nto the GW emission regime within a few hundred million years, overcoming the\n'final parsec' problem regardless of the stellar distribution.\n", "  We have obtained general expressions for the intensity of radiation,\ndecelerating force, the rate of heating and acceleration of a small polarizable\nparticle under the conditions of Cherenkov friction: at relativistic motion\nparallel to the surface of thick transparent dielectric plate. Comparison with\nthe results of other authors is given.\n", "  The nearby (6.5 pc) star HD 219134 was recently shown by Motalebi et al.\n(2015) and Vogt et al. (2015) to host several planets, the innermost of which\nis transiting. We present twenty-seven years of radial velocity observations of\nthis star from the McDonald Observatory Planet Search program, and nineteen\nyears of stellar activity data. We detect a long-period activity cycle measured\nin the Ca II $S_{HK}$ index, with a period of $4230 \\pm 100$ days (11.7 years),\nvery similar to the 11-year Solar activity cycle. Although the period of the\nSaturn-mass planet HD 219134 h is close to half that of the activity cycle, we\nargue that it is not an artifact due to stellar activity. We also find a\nsignificant periodicity in the $S_{HK}$ data due to stellar rotation with a\nperiod of 22.8 days. This is identical to the period of planet f identified by\nVogt et al. (2015), suggesting that this radial velocity signal might be caused\nby rotational modulation of stellar activity rather than a planet. Analysis of\nour radial velocities allows us to detect the long-period planet HD 219134 h\nand the transiting super-Earth HD 219134 b. Finally, we use our long time\nbaseline to constrain the presence of longer-period planets in the system,\nexcluding to $1\\sigma$ objects with $M\\sin i>0.36 M_J$ at 12 years\n(corresponding to the orbital period of Jupiter) and $M\\sin i>0.72 M_J$ at a\nperiod of 16.4 years (assuming a circular orbit for an outer companion).\n", "  Electrical circuits with transient elements can be good examples of systems\nwhere non--steady irreversible processes occur, so in the same way as a steady\nstate energy converter, we use the formal construction of the first order\nirreversible thermodynamic (FOIT) to describe the energetics of these circuits.\nIn this case, we propose an isothermic model of two meshes with transient and\npassive elements, besides containing two voltage sources (which can be\nfunctions of time); this is a non--steady energy converter model. Through the\nKirchhoff equations, we can write the circuit phenomenological equations. Then,\nwe apply an integral transformation to linearise the dynamic equations and\nrewrite them in algebraic form, but in the frequency space. However, the same\nsymmetry for steady states appears (cross effects). Thus, we can study the\nenergetic performance of this converter model by means of two parameters: the\n\"force ratio\" and the \"coupling degre\". Furthermore, it is possible to obtain\nthe characteristic functions (dissipation function, power output, efficiency,\netc.). They allow us to establish a simple optimal operation regime of this\nenergy converter. As an example, we obtain the converter behavior for the\nmaximum efficient power regime (MPE).\n", "  Let the vector bundle $\\mathcal{E}$ be a deformation of the tangent bundle\nover the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$. We compute the ring structure of sheaf\ncohomology valued in exterior powers of $\\mathcal{E}$, also known as the\npolymology. This is the first part of a project studying the quantum sheaf\ncohomology of Grassmannians with deformations of the tangent bundle, a\ngeneralization of ordinary quantum cohomology rings of Grassmannians. A\ncompanion physics paper [arXiv:1512.08586] describes physical aspects of the\ntheory, including a conjecture for the quantum sheaf cohomology ring, and\nnumerous examples.\n", "  We study the behavior of spinless fermions in superconducting state, in which\nthe phases of the superconducting order parameter depend on the direction of\nthe link. We find that the energy of the superconductor depends on the phase\ndifferences of the superconducting order parameter. The solutions for the\nphases corresponding to the energy minimuma, lead to a topological\nsuperconducting state with the nontrivial Chern numbers. We focus our\nquantitative analysis on the properties of topological states of\nsuperconductors with different crystalline symmetry and show that the phase\ntransition in the topological superconducting state is result of spontaneous\nbreaking of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. The\npeculiarities in the chiral gapless edge modes behavior are studied, the Chern\nnumbers are calculated.\n", "  Cosmic voids found in galaxy surveys are defined based on the galaxy\ndistribution in redshift space. We show that the large scale distribution of\nvoids in redshift space traces the fluctuations in the dark matter density\nfield \\delta(k) (in Fourier space with \\mu being the line of sight projected\nk-vector): \\delta_v^s(k) = (1 + \\beta_v \\mu^2) b^s_v \\delta(k), with a beta\nfactor that will be in general different than the one describing the\ndistribution of galaxies. Only in case voids could be assumed to be quasi-local\ntransformations of the linear (Gaussian) galaxy redshift space field, one gets\nequal beta factors \\beta_v=\\beta_g=f/b_g with f being the growth rate, and b_g,\nb^s_v being the galaxy and void bias on large scales defined in redshift space.\nIndeed, in our mock void catalogs we measure void beta factors being in good\nagreement with the galaxy one. Further work needs to be done to confirm the\nlevel of accuracy of the beta factor equality between voids and galaxies, but\nin general the void beta factor needs to be considered as a free parameter for\nRSD studies.\n", "  In this paper we use 1D quantum mechanical systems with Higgs-like\ninteraction potential to study the emergence of topological objects at finite\ntemperature. Two different model systems are studied, the standard double-well\npotential model and a newly introduced discrete kink model. Using Monte-Carlo\nsimulations as well as analytic methods, we demonstrate how kinks become\nabundant at low temperatures. These results may shed useful insights on how\ntopological phenomena may occur in QCD.\n", "  Suspensions of self-motile, elongated particles are a topic of significant\ncurrent interest, exemplifying a form of `active matter'. Examples include\nself-propelling bacteria, algae and sperm, and artificial swimmers. Ericksen's\nmodel of a transversely-isotropic fluid [J. L. Ericksen, Colloid Polym. Sci.\n173(2):117-122 (1960)] treats suspensions of non-motile particles as a\ncontinuum with an evolving preferred direction; this model describes fibrous\nmaterials as diverse as extracellular matrix, textile tufts and plant cell\nwalls. Director-dependent effects are incorporated through a modified stress\ntensor with four viscosity-like parameters. By making fundamental connections\nwith recent models for active suspensions, we propose a modification to\nEricksen's model, mainly the inclusion of self motility; this can be considered\nthe simplest description of an oriented suspension including\ntransversely-isotropic effects. Motivated by the fact that\ntransversely-isotropic fluids exhibit modified flow stability, we conduct a\nlinear stability analysis of two distinct cases, aligned and isotropic\nsuspensions of elongated active particles. Novel aspects include the\nanisotropic rheology and translational diffusion. In general anisotropic\neffects increase the instability of small perturbations, whilst translational\ndiffusion stabilises a range of wave-directions and, in some cases, a finite\nrange of wave-numbers, thus emphasising that both anisotropy and translational\ndiffusion can have important effects in these systems.\n", "  We study the production of spin 1/2 gravitinos in a thermal Universe. Taking\ninto account supersymmetry breaking due to the finite thermal energy density of\nthe Universe, there is a large enhancement in the cross section of production\nof these gravitino states. We consider gravitinos with zero temperature masses\nof 0.1 eV, 1 keV, 100 GeV and 30 TeV as representative of gauge mediated,\ngravity mediated and anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios. We find\nthat the abundance of gravitinos produced in the early Universe is very high\nfor gravitinos of mass 1 keV and 100 GeV. The gravitino abundances can be\nsufficiently suppressed if the reheat temperature is less than 100 GeV and\n$4\\cdot 10^4$ gev respectively. However such low reheat temperatures will rule\nout many models of baryogenesis including those via leptogenesis.\n", "  Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we investigate\nthe structure, stability, optical modes and electronic band gap of a distorted\ntetragonal MoS$_2$ monolayer (T'-MoS$_2$). Our simulated scanning tunnel\nmicroscopy (STM) images of T'-MoS$_2$ are dramatically similar with those STM\nimages which were identified as K$_{x}$(H$_{2}$O)$_{y}$MoS$_{2}$ from a\nprevious experimental study. This similarity suggests that T'-MoS$_2$ might\nhave already been observed in experiment but was unexpectedly misidentified.\nFurthermore, we verify the stability of T'-MoS$_2$ from thermal, mechanical and\ndynamic aspects, by \\emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulation, elastic\nconstants evaluation and phonon band structure calculation based on density\nfunctional perturbation theory, respectively. In addition, we calculate the\neigenfrequencies and eigenvectors of the optical modes of T'-MoS$_2$ at\n$\\Gamma$ point and distinguish their Raman and infrared activity by pointing\nout their irreducible representations using group theory; at the same time, we\ncompare the Raman modes of T'-MoS$_2$ with those of H-MoS$_2$ and T-MoS$_2$.\nOur results provide a useful guidance for further experimental identification\nand characterization of T'-MoS$_2$.\n", "  The focus of this work is a correspondence between the Hilbert space\noperators on one hand, and doubly periodic generalized functions on the other.\nThe linear map that implements it, referred to as the Q-transform, enables a\ndirect application of the classical Harmonic Analysis in a study of quantum\nsystems. In particular, the Q-transform makes it possible to reinterpret the\ndynamic of a quantum observable as a (typically nonlocal) dynamic of a\nclassical observable. From this point of view we carry out an analysis of an\nopen quantum system whose dynamics are governed by an asymptotically harmonic\nHamiltonian and compact type Lindblad operators. It is established that the\ninitial value problem of the equivalent nonlocal but classical evolution is\nwell posed in the appropriately chosen Sobolev spaces.\n  The second set of results pertains to a generalization of the basic\nQ-transform and highlights a certain type of asymptotic redundancy. This\nphenomenon, referred to as the broadband redundancy, is a consequence of a\nwell-known property of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, namely, the\nuniform distribution modulo one of their ordinates. Its relevance to the\nanalysis of quantum dynamics is only a special instance of its utility in\nharmonic analysis in general. It remains to be seen if the phenomenon is\nsignificant also in the physical sense, but it appears well-justified---in\nparticular, by the results presented here---to pose such a question.\n", "  The detection of an electron bunch exiting a strong magnetic field can prove\nchallenging due to the small mass of the electron. If placed too far from a\nsolenoid's entrance, a detector outside the magnetic field will be too small to\nreliably intersect with the exiting electron beam because the light electrons\nwill follow the diverging magnetic field outside the solenoid. The TITAN group\nat TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada, has made use of advances in the practice and\nprecision of photochemical machining (PCM) to create a new kind of charge\ncollecting detector called the \"mesh detector.\" The TITAN mesh detector was\nused to solve the problem of trapped electron detection in the new Cooler\nPEnning Trap (CPET) currently under development at TITAN. This thin array of\nwires etched out of a copper plate is a novel, low profile, charge agnostic\ndetector that can be made effectively transparent or opaque at the user's\ndiscretion.\n", "  We have investigated theoretically (with micromagnetic simulations and plane\nwave method) and experimentally (with ferromagnetic resonance and Brillouin\nlight scattering) three types of antidot lattices (ADLs) based on permalloy\nthin films with increased complexity of the unit cell: simple square,\nbi-component square and wave-like ADL. We have found that placing a small\nadditional antidot in the center of the unit cell of the square ADL modify\nsignificantly the spin wave spectrum and its dependence on the orientation of\nthe in-plane magnetic field. We also check the further changes of spin wave\nspectrum resulting from the introduction of air-gaps connecting small and large\nantidots. In particular, the presence of small antidots change the dependence\nof the frequency of the fundamental mode on the angle of the in-plane applied\nmagnetic field. The air-gaps strongly discriminates the propagation of spin\nwaves in two principal direction of ADL lattice, orthogonal to each other. In\nspite of these spectral changes, the spatial distribution of the spin wave\namplitude generally preserves some similarities for all three structures. We\nalso highlighted out the role of defects in the ADL in the observed spectra.\nThe obtained results can be interesting for the magnonics applications of the\nmagnonic crystals.\n", "  In this note we discuss how several results characterizing the qualitative\nbehavior of solutions to the nonlinear Poisson equation can be generalized to\nharmonic maps with potential between complete Riemannian manifolds. This\nincludes gradient estimates, monotonicity formulas and Liouville theorems under\ncurvature and energy assumptions.\n", "  We consider the problem of quantum and stochastic confinement for\ndrift-diffusion equations on domains $ \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb R^d$. We obtain\nvarious sufficient conditions on the behavior of the coefficients near the\nboundary of $\\Omega$ which ensure the essential self-adjointness or stochastic\ncompleteness of the symmetric form of the drift-diffusion operator,\n$-\\frac{1}{\\rho_\\infty}\\,\\nabla\\cdot \\rho_\\infty\\mathbb D\\nabla$. The proofs\nare based on the method developed in [29] for quantum confinement on bounded\ndomains in $\\mathbb R^d$. In particular for stochastic confinement we combine\nthe Liouville property with Agmon type exponential estimates for weak\nsolutions.\n", "  This paper is written as one chapter in a collection of essays on neutrino\nphysics for beginning graduate students. The text presents important\nexperimental methods and issues for those interested in searches for sterile\nneutrinos. Other essays in the collection, written by other authors, will cover\nintroduction to neutrinos in the Standard Model, a description of the theory,\nand discussion of details of detectors, thus these aspects are not covered\nhere. However, beyond these points, this represents a self-contained tutorial\non experimental studies of sterile neutrino oscillations, covering such issues\nas signals vs. limits, designing experiments, and performing and interpreting\nglobal fits to the oscillation data.\n", "  Starting from the general Berry phase theory of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction (DMI) we derive an expression for the linear contribution of the\nspin-orbit interaction (SOI). Thereby, we show analytically that at the first\norder in SOI DMI is given by the ground-state spin current. We verify this\nfinding numerically by ab-initio calculations in Mn/W(001) and Co/Pt(111)\nmagnetic bilayers. We show that despite the strong SOI from the 5$d$ heavy\nmetals DMI is well-approximated by the first order in SOI, while the\nground-state spin current is not. We decompose the SOI-linear contribution to\nDMI into two parts. One part has a simple interpretation in terms of the Zeeman\ninteraction between the spin-orbit field and the spin misalignment that\nelectrons acquire in magnetically noncollinear textures. This interpretation\nprovides also an intuitive understanding of the symmetry of DMI on the basis of\nthe spin-orbit field and it explains in a simple way why DMI and ground-state\nspin currents are related. Moreover, we show that energy currents driven by\nmagnetization dynamics and associated to DMI can be explained by\ncounter-propagating spin currents that carry energy due to their Zeeman\ninteraction with the spin-orbit field. Finally, we discuss options to modify\nDMI by nonequilibrium spin currents excited by electric fields or light.\n", "  Leading order ($\\alpha^4$) finite size corrections in muonic deuterium are\nevaluated within a few body formalism for the $\\mu^- p n$ system in muonic\ndeuterium and found to be sensitive to the input of the deuteron wave function.\nWe show that this sensitivity, taken along with the precise deuteron charge\nradius determined from muonic atom spectroscopy can be used to determine the\nelusive deuteron D-state probability, $P_D$, for a given model of the\nnucleon-nucleon (NN) potential. The radius calculated with a $P_D$ of 4.3\\% in\nthe chiral NN models and about 5.7\\% in the high precision NN potentials is\nfavoured most by the $\\mu^-d$ data.\n", "  The investigation of the ultimate limits imposed by quantum mechanics on\namplification represents an important topic both on a fundamental level and\nfrom the perspective of potential applications. We propose here a novel setup\nfor an optomechanical amplifier, constituted by a mechanical resonator\ndispersively coupled to an optomechanical cavity asymmetrically driven around\nboth mechanical sidebands. We show that, on general grounds, the present\namplifier operates in a novel regime-- which we here call phase-mixing\namplification. At the same time, for a suitable choice of parameters, the\namplifier proposed here operates as a phase-sensitive amplifier. Furthermore,\nwe show that both configurations allow amplification below the standard quantum\nlimit in a parameter range compatible with current experiments in microwave\ncircuit optomechanics.\n", "  We show that the counter-rotating terms of the dispersive qubit-cavity Rabi\nmodel can produce relatively large and nonmonotonic Bloch-Siegert shifts in the\ncavity frequency as the system is driven through a quantum-to-classical\ntransition. Using a weak microwave probe tone, we demonstrate experimentally\nthis effect by monitoring the resonance frequency of a microwave cavity coupled\nto a transmon and driven by a microwave field with varying power. In the weakly\ndriven regime (quantum phase), the Bloch-Siegert shift appears as a small\nconstant frequency shift, while for strong drive (classical phase) it presents\nan oscillatory behaviour as a function of the number of photons in the cavity.\nThe experimental results are in agreement with numerical simulations based on\nthe quasienergy spectrum.\n", "  Recent experiments have revealed that beyond-mean-field corrections are much\nmore relevant in weakly-interacting dipolar condensates than in their\nnon-dipolar counterparts. We show that in quasi-one-dimensional geometries\nquantum corrections in dipolar and non-dipolar condensates are strikingly\ndifferent due to the peculiar momentum dependence of the dipolar interactions.\nThe energy correction of the condensate presents not only a modified density\ndependence, but it may even change from attractive to repulsive at a critical\ndensity due to the surprising role played by the transversal directions. The\nanomalous quantum correction translates into a strongly modified physics for\nquantum-stabilized droplets and dipolar solitons. Moreover, and for similar\nreasons, quantum corrections of three-body correlations, and hence of\nthree-body losses, are strongly modified by the dipolar interactions. This\nintriguing physics can be readily probed in current experiments with magnetic\natoms.\n", "  Producing monolayers and few-layers in high yield with environment-stability\nis still a challenge in hafnium disulphide (HfS2), which is a layered\ntwo-dimensional material of group-IV transition metal dichalcogenides, to\nreveal its unlocked electronic and optoelectronic applications. For the first\ntime, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate a simple and cost-effective\nmethod to grow layered belt-like nano-crystals of HfS2 with surprisingly large\ninterlayer spacing followed by its chemical exfoliation. Various microscopic\nand spectroscopic techniques reveal these as-grown crystals exfoliate into\nsingle or few layers in some minutes using solvent assisted ultrasonification\nmethod in N-Cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone. The exfoliated nanosheets of HfS2 exhibit\nan indirect bandgap of 1.3 eV with high stability against ambient degradation.\nFurther, we demonstrate that these nanosheets holds potential for electronic\napplications by fabricating field-effect transistors based on few layered HfS2\nexhibiting field-effect mobility of 0.95 cm2/V-s with a high current modulation\nratio (Ion/Ioff) of 10^4 in ambient. The method is scalable and has potential\nsignificance for both academy and industry.\n", "  We present a numerical study of dense colloidal suspensions in\npressure-driven microchannel flow in two dimensions. The colloids are modeled\nas elastic and frictional spheres suspended in a Newtonian fluid, which we\nsimulate using the method of multi-particle collision dynamics. The model\nreproduces periodic velocity and density pulse trains, traveling upstream in\nthe microchannel, which are found in experiments conducted by L. Isa et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 058302 (2009)]. We show that colloid-wall friction and\nthe resultant force chains are crucial for the formation of these pulses. With\nincreasing colloid density first solitary jams occur, which become periodic\npulse trains at intermediate densities and unstable solitary pulses at high\ndensities. We formulate a phenomenological continuum model and show how these\nspatio-temporal flow and density profiles can be understood as homoclinic and\nperiodic orbits in traveling-wave equations.\n", "  Due to the self-referencing aspect, consciousness is placed in a unique\nnon-computable position among natural phenomena. Non-computable consciousness\nwas previously analyzed on the basis of self-referential cyclical time. This\npaper extends the cyclical model of vacuum observation and posits that choice,\nor the experience of reality, may be expressed as the initial part of the\nself-referencing loop, while the conscious awareness of the experience is the\nother part of the loop. In particular, the inseparability of the two sides of\nthe loop is established through the cyclical time process, which bears a\nresemblance to Heidegger's analysis of existence. The cyclical looping model is\nalso discussed in terms of Wittgenstein's analysis of language as attaching\nsemantic meaning, or continuous or infinite conscious awareness, to physical\nreality. We also discuss the proposed model of subjectivity and cyclical time -\nas opposed to objectivity and linear time - which may be considered similar to\nHebrew thought.\n", "  We provide a recipe to extract the supersymmetric Casimir energy of theories\ndefined on primary Hopf surfaces directly from the superconformal index. It\ninvolves an $\\mathrm{SL(3,\\mathbb{Z})}$ transformation acting on the complex\nstructure moduli of the background geometry. In particular, the known relation\nbetween Casimir energy, index and partition function emerges naturally from\nthis framework, allowing rewriting of the latter as a modified elliptic\nhypergeometric integral. We show this explicitly for $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SQCD and\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for all classical gauge\ngroups, and conjecture that it holds more generally. We also use our method to\nderive an expression for the Casimir energy of the nonlagrangian\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT with $\\mathrm{E_6}$ flavour symmetry. Furthermore, we\npredict an expression for Casimir energy of the $\\mathcal{N}=1$\n$\\mathrm{SP(2N)}$ theory with $\\mathrm{SU(8)\\times U(1)}$ flavour symmetry that\nis part of a multiple duality network, and for the doubled $\\mathcal{N}=1$\ntheory with enhanced $\\mathrm{E}_7$ flavour symmetry.\n", "  A search for the rare two-body charmless baryonic decay $B^+ \\to p\n\\bar\\Lambda$ is performed with $pp$ collision data, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of $3\\,\\mbox{fb}^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment\nat centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. An excess of $B^+ \\to p \\bar\\Lambda$\ncandidates with respect to background expectations is seen with a statistical\nsignificance of 4.1 standard deviations, and constitutes the first evidence for\nthis decay. The branching fraction, measured using the $B^+ \\to K^0_{\\mathrm S}\n\\pi^+$ decay for normalisation, is \\begin{eqnarray} \\mathcal{B}(B^+ \\to p\n\\bar\\Lambda) & = & ( 2.4 \\,^{+1.0}_{-0.8} \\pm 0.3 ) \\times 10^{-7} \\,,\n\\nonumber \\end{eqnarray} where the first uncertainty is statistical and the\nsecond systematic.\n", "  We work on a parallelizable time-orientable Lorentzian 4-manifold and prove\nthat in this case the notion of spin structure can be equivalently defined in a\npurely analytic fashion. Our analytic definition relies on the use of the\nconcept of a non-degenerate two-by-two formally self-adjoint first order linear\ndifferential operator and gauge transformations of such operators. We also give\nan analytic definition of spin structure for the 3-dimensional Riemannian case.\n", "  The spatio-temporal evolution of nonlinear oscillations in multi-species\nplasma is revisited to provide more insight into the physics of phase mixing by\nconstructing two sets of nonlinear solutions up to the second order. The first\nsolution exhibits perfect oscillations in the linear regime and phase mixing\nappears only nonlinearly in the second order as a response to the ponderomotive\nforces. This response can be both direct and indirect. The indirect\ncontribution of the ponderomotive forces appears through self-consistently\ngenerated low frequency fields. Furthermore, the direct and indirect\ncontributions of the ponderomotive forces on the phase mixing process is\nexplored and it is found that the indirect contribution is negligible in an\nelectron-ion plasma and it disappears in the case of electron-positron plasma,\nyet represents an equal contribution in the electron-positron-ion plasma.\nHowever, the second solution does not exhibit any phase mixing due to the\nabsence of ponderomotive forces but results in an undistorted nonlinear\ntraveling wave. These investigations have relevance for\nlaboratory/astrophysical multi-species plasma.\n", "  Motivated by recent synthetic and theoretical progress we consider magnetism\nin crystals of multi-nuclear organometallic complexes. We calculate the\nHeisenberg symmetric exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya antisymmetric\nexchange. We show how, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the interplay of\nelectronic correlations and quantum interference leads to a quasi-one\ndimensional effective spin model in a typical tri-nuclear complex,\nMo$_3$S$_7$(dmit)$_3$, despite its underlying three dimensional band structure.\nWe show that both intra- and inter-molecular spin-orbit coupling can cause an\neffective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Furthermore, we show that, even\nfor an isolated pair of molecules the relative orientation of the molecules\ncontrols the nature of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling. We show that\ninterference effects also play a crucial role in determining the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Thus, we argue, that multi-nuclear\norganometallic complexes represent an ideal platform to investigate the effects\nof Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions on quantum magnets.\n", "  We demonstrate control of a trapped-ion quantum harmonic oscillator in a\nsqueezed Fock state basis, using engineered Hamiltonians analogous to the\nJaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings forms. We demonstrate that for\nsqueezed Fock states with low $n$ the engineered Hamiltonians reproduce the\n$\\sqrt{n}$ scaling of the matrix elements which is typical of Jaynes-Cummings\nphysics, and also examine deviations due to the finite wavelength of our\ncontrol fields. Starting from a squeezed vacuum state, we apply sequences of\nalternating transfer pulses which allow us to climb the squeezed Fock state\nladder, creating states up to excitations of $n = 6$ with up to 8.7 dB of\nsqueezing, as well as demonstrating superpositions of these states. These\ntechniques offer access to new sets of states of the harmonic oscillator which\nmay be applicable for precision metrology or quantum information science.\n", "  Based on a sample of $1.31$ billion $J/\\psi$ events collected with the BESIII\ndetector, we report the study of the doubly radiative decay $\\eta^\\prime\\to\n\\gamma\\gamma\\pi^0$ for the first time, where the $\\eta^\\prime$ meson is\nproduced via the $J/\\psi\\to \\gamma\\eta^\\prime$ decay. The branching fraction of\n$\\eta^\\prime\\to \\gamma\\gamma\\pi^0$ inclusive decay is measured to be ${\\cal\nB}(\\eta^\\prime\\to \\gamma\\gamma\\pi^0)_{\\text{Incl.}}$ =\n$(3.20\\pm0.07\\mbox{(stat)}\\pm0.23\\mbox{(sys)})\\times 10^{-3}$, while the\nbranching fractions of the dominant process\n$\\eta^\\prime\\rightarrow\\gamma\\omega$ and the non-resonant component are\ndetermined to be ${\\cal B}(\\eta^\\prime\\to \\gamma\\omega)\\times {\\cal\nB}(\\omega\\to \\gamma\\pi^0) = (23.7 \\pm1.4\\mbox{(stat)}\\pm1.8\\mbox{(sys)})\\times\n10^{-4}$ and ${\\cal B}(\\eta^\\prime\\to \\gamma\\gamma\\pi^0)_{\\text{NR}} =\n(6.16\\pm0.64\\mbox{(stat)} \\pm0.67\\mbox{(sys)})\\times 10^{-4}$, respectively. In\naddition, the $M^2_{\\gamma\\gamma}$-dependent partial widths of the inclusive\ndecay are also presented.\n", "  A search for the charmless $B^{0}_{s} \\to \\eta^{\\prime}\\phi$ decay is\nperformed using $pp$ collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at\ncentre-of-mass energies of $7$ and $8$ TeV, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. No signal is observed and upper limits on the\n$B^{0}_{s} \\to \\eta^{\\prime}\\phi$ branching fraction are set to $0.82\\times\n10^{-6}$ at $90\\%$ and $1.01\\times 10^{-6}$ at $95\\%$ confidence level.\n", "  We investigate dynamical coupling between water and amino acid side-chain\nresidues in solvation dynamics by selecting residues often used as natural\nprobes, namely tryptophan, tyrosine and histidine, located at different\npositions on protein surface and having various degrees of solvent exposure.\nSuch differently placed residues are found to exhibit different timescales of\nrelaxation. The total solvation response, as measured by the probe is\ndecomposed in terms of its interactions with (i) protein core, (ii) side-chain\natoms and (iii) water molecules. Significant anti cross-correlations among\nthese contributions are observed as a result of side-chain assisted energy flow\nbetween protein core and hydration layer, which is important for the proper\nfunctionality of a protein. It is also observed that there are rotationally\nfaster as well as slower water molecules than that of bulk solvent, which are\nconsidered to be responsible for the multitude of timescales that are observed\nin solvation dynamics. We also establish that slow solvation derives a\nsignificant contribution from protein side-chain fluctuations. When the motion\nof the protein side-chains is forcefully quenched, solvation either becomes\nfaster or slower depending on the location of the probe.\n", "  In this article we propose a new design methodology allowing us to control\nboth ampli- tude and phase of electromagnetic waves from a cylindrical incident\nwave. This results in isotropic materials and does not resort to transformation\noptics or its quasi-conformal approximations. Our method leads to\ntwo-dimensional isotropic, inhomogeneous material profiles of permittivity and\npermeability, to which a general class of scattering-free wave solutions arise.\nOur design is based on the separation of the complex wave solution into\namplitude and phase. We give two types of examples to validate our methodology.\n", "  Odd index pairings of $K_1$-group elements with Fredholm modules are of\nrelevance in index theory, differential geometry and applications such as to\ntopological insulators. For the concrete setting of operators on a Hilbert\nspace over a lattice, it is shown how to calculate the resulting index as the\nsignature of a suitably constructed finite-dimensional matrix, more precisely\nthe finite volume restriction of what we call the spectral localizer. In\npresence of real symmetries, secondary $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariants can be\nobtained as the sign of the Pfaffian of the spectral localizer. These results\nreconcile two complementary approaches to invariants of topological insulators.\n", "  We present a complete analysis for double soft limit of graviton scattering\namplitude using the formalism proposed by Cachazo, He and Yuan. Our results\nagree with that obtained via BCFW recursion relations in arXiv:1504.05558. In\naddition we find precise relations between degenerate and nondegenerate\nsolutions of scattering equations with local and nonlocal terms in the soft\nfactor.\n", "  Quantum states of light having a Wigner function with negative values\nrepresent a key resource in quantum communication and quantum information\nprocessing. Here, we present the generation of such a state at the\ntelecommunication wavelength of 1550nm. The state is generated by means of\nphoton subtraction from a weakly squeezed vacuum state and is heralded by the\n`click' of a single photon counter. Balanced homodyne detection is applied to\nreconstruct the Wigner function, also yielding the state's photon number\ndistribution. The heralding photons are frequency up-converted to 532nm to\nallow for the use of a room-temperature (silicon) avalanche photo diode. The\nWigner function reads W(0,0)=-0.063 +/- 0.004 at the origin of phase space,\nwhich certifies negativity with more than 15 standard deviations.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a Sinai-oscillator\ntrap under a monochromatic driving force. Such a trap is formed by a harmonic\npotential and a repulsive disk located in the center vicinity corresponding to\nthe first experiments of condensate formation by Ketterle group in 1995. We\nargue that the external driving allows to model the regime of weak wave\nturbulence with the Kolmogorov energy flow from low to high energies. We show\nthat in a certain regime of weak driving and weak nonlinearity such a turbulent\nenergy flow is defeated by the Anderson localization that leads to localization\nof energy on low energy modes. A critical threshold is determined above which\nthe turbulent flow to high energies becomes possible. We argue that this\nphenomenon can be studied with ultra cold atoms in magneto-optical traps.\n", "  X-ray echo spectroscopy, a space-domain counterpart of neutron spin echo, is\na recently proposed inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) technique. X-ray echo\nspectroscopy relies on imaging IXS spectra, and does not require x-ray\nmonochromatization. Due to this, the echo-type IXS spectrometers are broadband,\nand thus have a potential to simultaneously provide dramatically increased\nsignal strength, reduced measurement times, and higher resolution compared to\nthe traditional narrow-band scanning-type IXS spectrometers. The theory of\nx-ray echo spectrometers presented in [1] is developed here further with a\nfocus on questions of practical importance, which could facilitate optical\ndesign and assessment of the feasibility and performance of the echo\nspectrometers. Among others, the following questions are addressed: spectral\nresolution, refocusing condition, echo spectrometer tolerances, refocusing\ncondition adjustment, effective beam size on the sample, spectral window of\nimaging and scanning range, impact of the secondary source size on the spectral\nresolution, angular dispersive optics, focusing and collimating optics, and\ndetector's spatial resolution. Examples of optical designs and characteristics\nof echo spectrometers with 1-meV and 0.1-meV resolutions are presented.\n", "  The stability of intrinsic point defects in Be$_{12}$X intermetallics (where\nX = Ti, V, Mo or W) are predicted using density functional theory simulations\nand discussed with respect to fusion energy applications. Schottky disorder is\nfound to be the lowest energy complete disorder process, closely matched by Be\nFrenkel disorder in the cases of Be$_{12}$V and Be$_{12}$Ti. Antitisite and X\nFrenkel disorder are of significantly higher energy. Small clusters of point\ndefects including Be divacancies, Be di-interstitials and accommodation of the\nX species on two Be sites were considered. Some di-interstitial, divacancy and\nX$_{2Be}$ combinations exhibit negative binding enthalpy (i.e. clustering is\nfavourable), although this is orientationally dependent. None of the Be$_{12}$X\nintermetallics are predicted to exhibit significant non-stoichiometry, ruling\nout non-stoichiometry as a mechanism for accommodating Be depletion due to\nneutron transmutation.\n", "  A prominent feature of quantum spin liquids is fractionalization of the spin\ndegree of freedom. Fractionalized excitations have their own dynamics in\ndifferent energy scales, and hence, affect finite-temperature ($T$) properties\nin a peculiar manner even in the paramagnetic state harboring the quantum spin\nliquid state. We here present a comprehensive theoretical study of the spin\ndynamics in a wide $T$ range for the Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice, whose\nground state is such a quantum spin liquid. In this model, the\nfractionalization occurs to break up quantum spins into itinerant matter\nfermions and localized gauge fluxes, which results in two crossovers at very\ndifferent $T$ scales. Extending the previous study for the isotropic coupling\ncase [J. Yoshitake, J. Nasu, and Y. Motome, Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\\textbf 117}$,\n157203 (2016)], we calculate the dynamical spin structure factor, the NMR\nrelaxation rate, and the magnetic susceptibility while changing the anisotropy\nin the exchange coupling constants, by using the dynamical mean-field theory\nand the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method based on a Majorana fermion\nrepresentation. We find that the system exhibits peculiar behaviors below the\nhigh-$T$ crossover whose temperature is comparable to the average of the\nexchange constants, reflecting the spin fractionalization in the paramagnetic\nregion. Among them, the dichotomy between the static and dynamical spin\ncorrelations is unusual behavior hardly seen in conventional magnets. We\ndiscuss the relation between the dichotomy and the spatial configuration of\ngauge fluxes. Our results could stimulate further experimental and theoretical\nanalyses of candidate materials for the Kitaev quantum spin liquids.\n", "  In this note, we prove an ${L^{\\frac{n}{2}}}$-energy gap result for\nYang-Mills connections on a principal $G$-bundle over a compact manifold\nwithout using Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality (arXiv:1502.00668).\n", "  We study frictionless and non-adhesive contact between elastic half-spaces\nwith self-affine surfaces. Using a recently suggested corrective technique, we\nensure an unprecedented accuracy in computation of the true contact area\nevolution under increasing pressure. This accuracy enables us to draw\nconclusions on the role of the surface's spectrum breadth (Nayak parameter) in\nthe contact area evolution. We show that for a given normalized pressure, the\ncontact area decreases logarithmically with the Nayak parameter. By linking the\nNayak parameter with the Hurst exponent (or fractal dimension), we show the\neffect of the latter on the true contact area. This effect, undetectable for\nsurfaces with poor spectral content, is quite strong for surfaces with rich\nspectra. Numerical results are compared with analytical models and other\navailable numerical results. A phenomenological equation for the contact area\ngrowth is suggested with coefficients depending on the Nayak parameter. Using\nthis equation, the pressure-dependent friction coefficient is deduced based on\nthe adhesive theory of friction. Some observations on Persson's model of rough\ncontact, whose prediction does not depend on Nayak parameter, are reported.\nOverall, the paper provides a unifying picture of rough elastic contact and\nclarifies discrepancies between preceding results.\n", "  We present dynamical measurements from the KMOS (K-band Multi-Object\nSpectrograph) Deep Survey (KDS), which is comprised of 77 typical star-forming\ngalaxies at z $\\simeq$ 3.5 in the mass range 9.0 < log(M$_{\\star}$/M$_{\\odot}$)\n< 10.5. These measurements constrain the internal dynamics, the intrinsic\nvelocity dispersions ({\\sigma}$_{int}$) and rotation velocities (V$_{C}$) of\ngalaxies in the high redshift Universe. The mean velocity dispersion of the\ngalaxies in our sample is {\\sigma}$_{int}$ = $70.8^{+3.3}_{-3.1}$ km s$^{-1}$,\nrevealing that the increasing average {\\sigma}$_{int}$ with increasing\nredshift, reported for z $\\lesssim2$, continues out to z $\\simeq$ 3.5. Only 34\n$\\pm$ 8% of our galaxies are rotation-dominated (V$_{C}$/{\\sigma}$_{int}$ > 1),\nwith the sample average V$_{C}$/{\\sigma}$_{int}$ value much smaller than at\nlower redshift. After carefully selecting comparable star-forming samples at\nmultiple epochs, we find that the rotation-dominated fraction evolves with\nredshift with a z$^{-0.2}$ dependence. The rotation-dominated KDS galaxies show\nno clear offset from the local rotation velocity-stellar mass (i.e.\nV$_{C}$-M$_{\\star}$) relation, although a smaller fraction of the galaxies are\non the relation due to the increase in the dispersion-dominated fraction. These\nobservations are consistent with a simple equilibrium model picture, in which\nrandom motions are boosted in high redshift galaxies by a combination of the\nincreasing gas fractions, accretion efficiency, specific star-formation rate\nand stellar feedback and which may provide significant pressure support against\ngravity on the galactic disk scale.\n", "  In the future-included real action theory whose path runs over not only past\nbut also future, we demonstrate a theorem, which states that the normalized\nmatrix element of a Hermitian operator $\\hat{\\cal O}$ defined in terms of the\nfuture state at the final time $T_B$ and the fixed past state at the initial\ntime $T_A$ becomes real for the future state selected such that the absolute\nvalue of the transition amplitude from the past state to the future state is\nmaximized. This is a special version of our previously proposed theorem for the\nfuture-included complex action theory. We find that though the maximization\nprinciple leads to the reality of the normalized matrix element in the\nfuture-included real action theory, it does not specify the future and past\nstates so much as in the case of the future-included complex action theory. In\naddition, we argue that the normalized matrix element seems to be more natural\nthan the usual expectation value. Thus we speculate that the functional\nintegral formalism of quantum theory could be most elegant in the\nfuture-included complex action theory.\n", "  We report on the local control of the transition frequency of a spin-$1/2$\nencoded in two Rydberg levels of an individual atom by applying a\nstate-selective light shift using an addressing beam. With this tool, we first\nstudy the spectrum of an elementary system of two spins, tuning it from a\nnon-resonant to a resonant regime, where \"bright\" (superradiant) and \"dark\"\n(subradiant) states emerge. We observe the collective enhancement of the\nmicrowave coupling to the bright state. We then show that after preparing an\ninitial single spin excitation and letting it hop due to the spin-exchange\ninteraction, we can freeze the dynamics at will with the addressing laser,\nwhile preserving the coherence of the system. In the context of quantum\nsimulation, this scheme opens exciting prospects for engineering inhomogeneous\nXY spin Hamiltonians or preparing spin-imbalanced initial states.\n", "  We analyze the secular evolution of hierarchical triple systems in the\npost-Newtonian approximation to general relativity. We expand the Newtonian\nthree-body equations of motion in powers of the ratio $a/A$, where $a$ and $A$\nare the semimajor axis of the inner binary's orbit and of the orbit of the\nthird body relative to the center of mass of the inner binary, respectively.\nThe leading order \"quadrupole\" terms, of order $(a/A)^3$ relative to the\n$1/a^2$ acceleration within the inner binary, are responsible for the\nwell-known Kozai-Lidov oscillations of orbital inclination and eccentricity.\nThe octupole terms, of order $(a/A)^4$ have been shown to allow the inner orbit\nto \"flip\" from prograde relative to the outer orbit to retrograde and back, and\nto permit excursions to very large eccentricities. We carry the expansion of\nthe equations of motion to hexadecapole order, corresponding to contributions\nof order $(a/A)^5$. We also include the leading orbital effects of\npost-Newtonian theory, namely the pericenter precessions of the inner and outer\norbits. Using the Lagrange planetary equations for the orbit elements of both\nbinaries, we average over orbital timescales, obtain the equations for the\nsecular evolution of the elements through hexadecapole order, and employ them\nto analyze cases of astrophysical interest. We find that, for the most part,\nthe orbital flips found at octupole order are robust against both relativistic\nand hexadecapole perturbations. We show that, for equal-mass inner binaries,\nwhere the octupole terms vanish, the hexadecapole contributions can alone\ngenerate orbital flips and excursions to very large eccentricities.\n", "  We study discrete $\\beta$-ensembles as introduced in [17]. We obtain rigidity\nestimates on the particle locations, i.e. with high probability, the particles\nare close to their classical locations with an optimal error estimate. We prove\nthe edge universality of the discrete $\\beta$-ensembles, i.e. for $\\beta\\geq\n1$, the distribution of extreme particles converges to the Tracy-Widom $\\beta$\ndistribution. As far as we know, this is the first proof of general Tracy-Widom\n$\\beta$ distributions in the discrete setting. A special case of our main\nresults implies that under the Jack deformation of the Plancherel measure, the\ndistribution of the lengths of the first few rows in Young diagrams, converges\nto the Tracy-Widom $\\beta$ distribution, which answers an open problem in [39].\nOur proof relies on Nekrasov's (or loop) equations, a multiscale analysis and a\ncomparison argument with continuous $\\beta$-ensembles.\n", "  A pair of type-II Dirac cones in PdTe$_2$ was recently predicted by theories\nand confirmed in experiments, making PdTe$_2$ the first material that processes\nboth superconductivity and type-II Dirac fermions. In this work, we study the\nevolution of Dirac cones in PdTe$_2$ under hydrostatic pressure by the\nfirst-principles calculations. Our results show that the pair of type-II Dirac\npoints disappears at 6.1 GPa. Interestingly, a new pair of type-I Dirac points\nfrom the same two bands emerges at 4.7 GPa. Due to the distinctive band\nstructures compared with those of PtSe$_2$ and PtTe$_2$, the two types of Dirac\npoints can coexist in PdTe$_2$ under proper pressure (4.7-6.1 GPa). The\nemergence of type-I Dirac cones and the disappearance of type-II Dirac ones are\nattributed to the increase/decrease of the energy of the states at $\\Gamma$ and\n$A$ point, which have the anti-bonding/bonding characters of interlayer Te-Te\natoms. On the other hand, we find that the superconductivity of PdTe$_2$\nslightly decreases with pressure. The pressure-induced different types of Dirac\ncones combined with superconductivity may open a promising way to investigate\nthe complex interactions between Dirac fermions and superconducting\nquasi-particles.\n", "  We demonstrate the active tuning of all-dielectric metasurfaces exhibiting\nhigh-quality factor (high-Q) resonances. The active control is provided by\nembedding the asymmetric silicon meta-atoms with liquid crystals, which allows\nthe relative index of refraction to be controlled through heating. It is found\nthat high quality factor resonances ($Q=270\\pm30$) can be tuned over more than\nthree resonance widths. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using\nall-dielectric metasurfaces to construct tunable narrow-band filters.\n", "  We develop a no-go theorem for two-dimensional bosonic systems with crystal\nsymmetries: if there is a half-integer spin at a rotation center, where the\npoint-group symmetry is $\\mathbb D_{2,4,6}$, such a system must have a\nground-state degeneracy protected by the crystal symmetry. Such a degeneracy\nindicates either a broken-symmetry state or a unconventional state of matter.\nComparing to the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem, our result counts the spin at\neach rotation center, instead of the total spin per unit cell, and therefore\nalso applies to certain systems with an even number of half-integer spins per\nunit cell.\n", "  We present a novel approach for a combined analysis of X-ray and\ngravitational lensing data and apply this technique to the merging galaxy\ncluster MACS J0416.1$-$2403. The method exploits the information on the\nintracluster gas distribution that comes from a fit of the X-ray surface\nbrightness, and then includes the hot gas as a fixed mass component in the\nstrong lensing analysis. With our new technique, we can separate the\ncollisional from the collision-less diffuse mass components, thus obtaining a\nmore accurate reconstruction of the dark matter distribution in the core of a\ncluster. We introduce an analytical description of the X-ray emission coming\nfrom a set of dual Pseudo-Isothermal Elliptical (dPIE) mass distributions,\nwhich can be directly used in most lensing softwares. By combining\n\\emph{Chandra} observations with Hubble Frontier Fields imaging and MUSE\nspectroscopy in MACS J0416.1$-$2403, we measure a projected gas over total mass\nfraction of approximately $10\\%$ at $350$ kpc from the cluster center. Compared\nto the results of a more traditional cluster mass model (diffuse halos plus\nmember galaxies), we find a significant difference in the cumulative projected\nmass profile of the dark matter component and that the dark matter to total\nmass fraction is almost constant, out to more than $350$ kpc. In the coming era\nof large surveys, these results show the need of multi-probe analyses for\ndetailed dark matter studies in galaxy clusters.\n", "  We consider slowly evolving, i.e. ADIABATIC, operational regime within a\ntransmission level (continental scale) natural gas pipeline system. This allows\nus to introduce a set of nodal equations of reduced complexity describing gas\ntransients in injection/consumption UNBALANCED (so-called line-pack) cases. We\ndiscuss, in details, construction of the UNBALANCED ADIABATIC (UA)\napproximation on the basic example of a single pipe. The UA approximation is\nexpected to play a significant \"model reduction\" role in solving control,\noptimization and planning problems relevant for flawless functioning of modern\nnatural gas networks.\n", "  Dense suspensions are non-Newtonian fluids which exhibit strong shear\nthickening and normal stress differences. Using numerical simulation of\nextensional and shear flows, we investigate how rheological properties are\ndetermined by the microstructure which is built under flows and by the\ninteractions between particles. By imposing extensional and shear flows, we can\nassess the degree of flow-type dependence in regimes below and above\nthickening. Even when the flow-type dependence is hindered, nondissipative\nresponses, such as normal stress differences, are present and characterise the\nnon-Newtonian behaviour of dense suspensions.\n", "  The term dark radiation is used both to describe a noninteracting neutrino\nspecies and as a correction to the Friedmann Equation in the simplest\nfive-dimensional RS-II brane-world cosmology. In this paper we consider the\nconstraints on both meanings of dark radiation based upon the newest results\nfor light-element nuclear reaction rates, observed light-element abundances and\nthe power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Adding dark\nradiation during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) alters the Friedmann expansion\nrate causing the nuclear reactions to freeze out at a different temperature.\nThis changes the final light element abundances at the end of BBN. Its\ninfluence on the CMB is to change the effective expansion rate at the surface\nof last scattering. We find that the BBN constraint reduces the allowed range\nfor both types of dark radiation at 10 Mev to between $-12.1\\%$ and $+6.2\\%$ of\nthe {\\bf total} background energy density at 10 Mev. Combining this result with\nfits to the CMB power spectrum, produces different results for particle vs.\nbrane-world dark radiation. In the brane-world, the range decreases to $-6.0\\%$\nto $+6.2\\%$. Thus, we find, that the ratio of dark radiation to the background\ntotal relativistic mass energy density $\\rho_{\\rm DR}/\\rho$ is consistent with\nzero although there remains a very slight preference for a positive (rather\nthan negative) contribution.\n", "  We provide a complete and self-contained proof of spectral and dynamical\nlocalization for the one-dimensional Anderson model, starting from the\npositivity of the Lyapunov exponent provided by F\\\"urstenberg's theorem. That\nis, a Schr\\\"odinger operator in $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})$ whose potential is given\nby independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables almost surely\nhas pure point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions and its\nunitary group exhibits exponential off-diagonal decay, uniformly in time. This\nis achieved by way of a new result: for the Anderson model, one typically has\nLyapunov behavior for all generalized eigenfunctions. We also explain how to\nobtain analogous statements for extended CMV matrices whose Verblunsky\ncoefficients are i.i.d., as well as for half-line analogs of these models.\n", "  We report the fully-scalable fabrication of a large array of hybrid\nmolybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) - silicon dioxide (SiO$_2$) one-dimensional,\nfree-standing photonic-crystal cavities capable of enhancement of the MoS$_2$\nphotoluminescence at the narrow cavity resonance. We demonstrate continuous\ntunability of the cavity resonance wavelength across the entire emission band\nof MoS$_2$ simply by variation of the photonic crystal periodicity. Device\nfabrication started by substrate-scale growth of MoS$_2$ using chemical vapor\ndeposition (CVD) on non-birefringent thermal oxide on a silicon wafer; it was\nfollowed by lithographic fabrication of a photon crystal nanocavity array on\nthe same substrate at more than 50% yield of functional devices. Our cavities\nexhibit three dominant modes with measured linewidths less than 0.2 nm,\ncorresponding to quality factors exceeding 4000. All experimental findings are\nfound to be in excellent agreement with finite difference time domain\nsimulations.\n", "  We present a formulation of Double Field Theory with a Drinfeld double as\nextended spacetime. It makes Poisson-Lie T-duality (including abelian and\nnon-abelian T-duality as special cases) manifest. This extends the scope of\npossible applications of the theory, which so far captured abelian T-duality\nonly, considerably. The full massless bosonic subsector (NS/NS and R/R) of type\nII string theories is covered.\n", "  The theoretical and numerical models for gravity driven coating flow on upper\ncylinder and sphere are formulated. Using a perturbation method, the governing\nequations which depend on one Bond number $Bo$ are derived for a liquid film\nflow down the outside of a horizontal cylinder and a sphere. They can be\nsimplified to one-dimensional form due to the symmetries. The general structure\nof the two-dimensional and axisymmetric capillary waves under high $Bo$\ncondition is focused on. An asymptotic theory is used to solve for the\nfree-surface profiles in the outer and inner region, respectively. Even though\nthe evolution in the outer region is essentially different, there are inherent\nsimilarities in the inner region because the capillary ridges are proved to\ndegenerate into the one-parameter family in high $Bo$ limit. Using appropriate\nnumerical techniques, some parametric studies are performed on the profiles of\nthe capillary waves. The spreading of the front recorded from the outer\nsolutions quantitatively accords with the scaling laws in a top region at early\ntime, but deviates obviously at later time. The comparison between the\ncomposite solutions constructed using the asymptotic theory and direct\nsolutions calculated from the evolution equations is highlighted via both the\nglobal and local features. Agreement between the composite solutions and the\ndirect solutions is good for high $Bo$ cases. This asymptotic behavior is\ncommon on both of cylindrical and spherical surfaces and not affected by the\npartial wetting process.\n", "  We study quintessential inflation with an inverse hyperbolic type potential\n$V(\\phi) = {V_0}/{\\cosh \\left( {\\phi^n}/{\\lambda^n} \\right)}$, where $V_0$,\n$\\lambda$ and \"n\" are parameters of the theory. We obtain a bound on $\\lambda$\nfor different values of the parameter n. The spectral index and the\ntensor-to-scalar-ratio fall in the $1 \\sigma$ bound given by the Planck 2015\ndata for $n \\geq 5$ for certain values of $\\lambda$. However for $3 \\leq n < 5$\nthere exist values of $\\lambda$ for which the spectral index and the\ntensor-to-scalar-ratio fall only within the $2 \\sigma$ bound of the Planck\ndata. Furthermore, we show that the scalar field with the given potential can\nalso give rise to late time acceleration if we invoke the coupling to massive\nneutrino matter. We also consider the instant preheating mechanism with Yukawa\ninteraction and put bounds on the coupling constants for our model using the\nnucleosynthesis constraint on relic gravity waves produced during inflation.\n", "  A lot of scientific works are published in different areas of science,\ntechnology, engineering and mathematics. It is not easy, even for experts, to\njudge the quality of authors, papers and venues (conferences and journals). An\nobjective measure to assign scores to these entities and to rank them is very\nuseful. Although, several metrics and indexes have been proposed earlier, they\nsuffer from various problems. In this paper, we propose a graph-based analytics\nframework to assign scores and to rank authors, papers and venues. Our\nalgorithm considers only the link structures of the underlying graphs. It does\nnot take into account other aspects, such as the associated texts and the\nreputation of these entities. In the limit of large number of iterations, the\nsolution of the iterative equations gives the unique entity scores. This\nframework can be easily extended to other interdependent networks.\n", "  Using the methods of symplectic geometry, we establish the existence of a\ncanonical transformation from potential model Hamiltonians of standard form in\na Euclidean space to an equivalent geometrical form on a manifold, where the\ncorresponding motions are along geodesic curves. The advantage of this\nrepresentation is that it admits the computation of geometric deviation as a\ntest for local stability, shown in previous studies to be a very effective\ncriterion for the stability of the orbits generated by the potential model\nHamiltonian. We describe here an algorithm for finding the generating function\nfor the canonical transformation and describe some of the properties of this\nmapping under local diffeomorphisms. We give a convergence proof for this\nalgorithm for the one-dimensional case, and provide a precise geometric\nformulation of geodesic deviation which relates the stability of the motion in\nthe geometric form to that of the Hamiltonian standard form. We discuss the\nrelation of bounded domains in the two representations for which Morse theory\nwould be applicable. Numerical computations for some interesting examples will\nbe presented in forthcoming papers.\n", "  This is a review of two-dimensional conformal field theory including some of\nthe relations to integrable models. An effort is made to develop the basic\nformalism in a way which is as elementary and flexible as possible at the same\ntime. Some advanced topics like conformal field theory on higher genus surfaces\nand relations to the isomonodromic deformation problem are discussed, for other\ntopics we offer a first guide to the literature.\n", "  We define new deformable families of vertex operator algebras\n$\\mathfrak{A}[\\mathfrak{g}, \\Psi, \\sigma]$ associated to a large set of\nS-duality operations in four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory. They are\ndefined as algebras of protected operators for two-dimensional supersymmetric\njunctions which interpolate between a Dirichlet boundary condition and its\nS-duality image. The $\\mathfrak{A}[\\mathfrak{g}, \\Psi, \\sigma]$ VOAs are\nequipped with two $\\mathfrak{g}$ affine vertex subalgebras whose levels are\nrelated by the S-duality operation. They compose accordingly under a natural\nconvolution operation and can be used to define an action of the S-duality\noperations on a certain space of VOAs equipped with a $\\mathfrak{g}$ affine\nvertex subalgebra. We give a self-contained definition of the S-duality action\non that space of VOAs. The space of conformal blocks (in the derived sense,\ni.e. chiral homology) for $\\mathfrak{A}[\\mathfrak{g}, \\Psi, \\sigma]$ is\nexpected to play an important role in a broad generalization of the quantum\nGeometric Langlands program. Namely, we expect the S-duality action on VOAs to\nextend to an action on the corresponding spaces of conformal blocks. This\naction should coincide with and generalize the usual quantum Geometric\nLanglands correspondence. The strategy we use to define the\n$\\mathfrak{A}[\\mathfrak{g}, \\Psi, \\sigma]$ VOAs is of broader applicability and\nleads to many new results and conjectures about deformable families of VOAs.\n", "  We propose to measure tagged deep inelastic scattering from light nuclei\n(deuterium and $^4$He) by detecting the low energy nuclear spectator recoil (p,\n$^3$H and $^3$He) in addition to the scattered electron. The proposed\nexperiment will provide stringent tests leading to clear differentiation\nbetween the many models describing the EMC effect, by accessing the bound\nnucleon virtuality through its initial momentum at the point of interaction.\nIndeed, conventional nuclear physics explanations of the EMC effect mainly\nbased on Fermi motion and binding effects yield very different predictions than\nmore exotic scenarios, where bound nucleons basically loose their identity when\nembedded in the nuclear medium. By distinguishing events where the interacting\nnucleon was slow, as described by a mean field scenario, or fast, very likely\nbelonging to a correlated pair, will clearly indicate which phenomenon is\nrelevant to explain the EMC effect. An important challenge for such\nmeasurements using nuclear spectators is the control of the theoretical\nframework and, in particular, final state interactions. This experiment will\ndirectly provide the necessary data needed to test our understanding of\nspectator tagging and final state interactions in $^2$H and $^4$He and their\nimpact on the semi-inclusive measurements of the EMC effect described above.\n", "  In this talk I discuss the status and future prospects of testing the Higgs\nself-couplings at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) as well as several Beyond\nStandard Model (BSM) scenarios that could be probed via Higgs pair production\nin the coming years.\n", "  I present a preliminary version of {\\tt APFEL++}, a C++ rewriting of the\nFortran 77 evolution code {\\tt APFEL}. In this contribution I discuss the new\nphilosophy adopted for the numerical computation of the convolutions,\ndemonstrate the ability to reproduce old results in an accurate and fast way,\nand present an original application to the computation of the semi-inclusive\ndeep-inelastic-scattering cross section to next-to-leading order in QCD.\n", "  I present a determination of the photon PDF from a fit to the recent ATLAS\nmeasurements of high-mass Drell-Yan lepton-pair production at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$\nTeV. This analysis is based on the {\\tt xFitter} framework interfaced to the\n{\\tt APFEL} program, that accounts for NLO QED effects, and to the {\\tt\naMCfast} code to account for the photon-initiated contributions within {\\tt\nMadGraph5\\_aMC@NLO}. The result is compared with other recent determinations of\nthe photon PDF finding a general good agreement.\n", "  This article deals with the first detection of gravitational waves by the\nadvanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors\non 14 September 2015, where the signal was generated by two stellar mass black\nholes with masses 36 $ M_{\\odot}$ and 29 $ M_{\\odot}$ that merged to form a 62\n$ M_{\\odot}$ black hole, releasing 3 $M_{\\odot}$ energy in gravitational waves,\nalmost 1.3 billion years ago. We begin by providing a brief overview of\ngravitational waves, their sources and the gravitational wave detectors. We\nthen describe in detail the first detection of gravitational waves from a\nbinary black hole merger. We then comment on the electromagnetic follow up of\nthe detection event with various telescopes. Finally, we conclude with the\ndiscussion on the tests of gravity and fundamental physics with the first\ngravitational wave detection event.\n", "  The stellar halos of galaxies encode their accretion histories. In\nparticular, the median metallicity of a halo is determined primarily by the\nmass of the most massive accreted object. We use hydrodynamical cosmological\nsimulations from the APOSTLE project to study the connection between the\nstellar mass, the metallicity distribution, and the stellar age distribution of\na halo and the identity of its most massive progenitor. We find that the\nstellar populations in an accreted halo typically resemble the old stellar\npopulations in a present-day dwarf galaxy with a stellar mass $\\sim 0.2-0.5$\ndex greater than that of the stellar halo. This suggest that had they not been\naccreted, the primary progenitors of stellar halos would have evolved to\nresemble typical nearby dwarf irregulars.\n", "  By means of molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the formation of\nsingle-chain nanoparticles through intramolecular cross-linking of polymer\nchains, in the presence of their precursors acting as purely steric crowders in\nconcentrated solution. In the case of the linear precursors, the structure of\nthe resulting SCNPs is weakly affected by the density at which the synthesis is\nperformed. Crowding has significant effects if ring precursors are used: higher\nconcentrations lead to the formation of SCNPs with more compact and spherical\nmorphologies. Such SCNPs retain in the swollen state (high dilution) the\ncrumpled globular conformations adopted by the ring precursors in the crowded\nsolutions. Increasing the concentration of both the linear and ring precursors\nup to $30 \\%$ leads to faster formation of the respective SCNPs.\n", "  We show that the coherence between different bacteriochlorophyll-a (BChla)\nsites in the Fenna-Mathews-Olson complex is an essential ingredient for\nexcitation energy transfer between various sites. The coherence delocalizes the\nexcitation energy, which results in the redistribution of excitation among all\nthe BChla sites in the steady state. We further show that the system remains\npartially coherent at the steady state. In our numerical simulation of the\nnon-Markovian density matrix equation, we consider both the inhomogeneity of\nthe protein environment and the effect of active vibronic modes.\n", "  $\\alpha$-graphyne is a two-dimensional sheet of $sp$-$sp^2$ hybridized carbon\natoms in a honeycomb lattice. While the geometrical structure is similar to\nthat of graphene, the hybridized triple bonds give rise to electronic structure\nthat is different from that of graphene. Similar to graphene, $\\alpha$-graphyne\ncan be stacked in bilayers with two stable configurations, but the different\nstackings have very different electronic structures: one is predicted to have\ngapless parabolic bands and the other a tunable band gap which is attractive\nfor applications. In order to realize applications, it is crucial to understand\nwhich stacking is more stable. This is difficult to model, as the stability is\na result of weak interlayer van der Waals interactions which are not well\ncaptured by density functional theory (DFT). We have used quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations that accurately include van der Waals interactions to calculate the\ninterlayer binding energy of bilayer graphyne and to determine its most stable\nstacking mode. Our results show that interlayer bindings of $sp$- and\n$sp^{2}$-bonded carbon networks are significantly underestimated in a Kohn-Sham\nDFT approach, even with an exchange-correlation potential corrected to include,\nin some approximation, van der Waals interactions. Finally, our quantum Monte\nCarlo calculations reveal that the interlayer binding energy difference between\nthe two stacking modes is only 0.9(4) meV/atom. From this we conclude that the\ntwo stable stacking modes of bilayer $\\alpha$-graphyne are almost degenerate\nwith each other, and both will occur with about the same probability at room\ntemperature unless there is a synthesis path that prefers one stacking over the\nother.\n", "  In this paper, we survey recent progress on the Null Penrose Conjecture,\nincluding a proof of the conjecture for smooth null cones that are foliated by\ndoubly convex spheres.\n", "  This editorial introduces the J. Phys. B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical\nPhysics Special Issue \"Atomic and Molecular Processes in the Ultracold Regime,\nthe Chemical Regime and Astrophysics\" dedicated to Professor Alexander Dalgarno\n(1928-2015). After a brief biographical review, short summaries of the\ncontributed papers and their relations to some of Prof. Dalgarno's work are\ngiven.\n", "  It has been recently shown by H.Weber and J.C. Mourrat, for the\ntwo-dimensional Ising-Kac model at critical temperature, that the fluctuation\nfield of the magnetization, under the Glauber dynamic, converges in\ndistribution to the solution of a non linear ill-posed SPDE: the dynamical\n$\\Phi^4_2$ equation. In this article we consider the case of the multivatiate\nstochastic quantization equation $\\Phi^{2n}_2$ on the two-dimensional torus,\nand we answer to a conjecture of H.Weber and H.Shen. We show that it is\npossible to find a state space for a spin system on the two-dimensional\ndiscrete torus undergoing Glauber dynamic with ferromagnetic Kac potential,\nsuch that the fluctuation field converges in distribution to $\\Phi^{2n}_2$.\n", "  Theoretical descriptions of the Seebeck coefficient in terms of the\ndifferential electrical conductivity given by Cutler and Mott is the foundation\nof later works in terms of transmission function from the thermoelectric\ntransport theory. On the other hand, recent studies in the literature have\nshown the relation between the Seebeck coefficient and chemical potential of\nelectrons. In this work, this relation is rigorously derived from fundamental\nthermodynamics, and an formalism for the parameter-free calculation of the\nSeebeck coefficient based on the electronic density-of-states from\nfirst-principles calculations is presented. Numerical results are given using\nthe n-type La3-xTe4 thermoelectric material as the prototype. With the rigid\nband approximation, the calculated temperature dependences of the Seebeck\ncoefficients of La3-xTe4 as a function of carrier concentration show excellent\nagreements with experimental data.\n", "  Binary mixtures of dry grains avalanching down a slope are experimentally\nstudied in order to determine the interaction among coarse and fine grains and\ntheir effect on the deposit morphology. The distance travelled by the massive\nfront of the avalanche over the horizontal plane of deposition area is measured\nas a function of mass content of fine particles in the mixture, grain-size\nratio, and flume tilt. A sudden transition of the runout is detected at a\ncritical content of fine particles, with a dependence on the grain-size ratio\nand flume tilt. This transition is explained as two simultaneous avalanches in\ndifferent flowing regimes (a viscous-like one and an inertial one) competing\nagainst each other and provoking a full segregation and a split-off of the\ndeposit into two well-defined, separated deposits. The formation of the distal\ndeposit, in turn, depends on a critical amount of coarse particles. This allows\nthe condensation of the pure coarse deposit around a small, initial seed\ncluster, which grows rapidly by braking and capturing subsequent colliding\ncoarse particles. For different grain-size ratios and keeping a constant total\nmass, the change in the amount of fines needed for the transition to occur is\nfound to be always less than 7%. For avalanches with a total mass of 4 kg we\nfind that, most of the time, the runout of a binary avalanche is larger than\nthe runout of monodisperse avalanches of corresponding constituent particles,\ndue to lubrication on the coarse-dominated side or to drag by inertial\nparticles on the fine-dominated side.\n", "  We demonsrtate electrical spin injection and detection in $n$-type Ge\n($n$-Ge) at room temperature using four-terminal nonlocal spin-valve and\nHanle-effect measurements in lateral spin-valve (LSV) devices with\nHeusler-alloy Schottky tunnel contacts. The spin diffusion length\n($\\lambda$$_{\\rm Ge}$) of the Ge layer used ($n \\sim$ 1 $\\times$ 10$^{19}$\ncm$^{-3}$) at 296 K is estimated to be $\\sim$ 0.44 $\\pm$ 0.02 $\\mu$m.\nRoom-temperature spin signals can be observed reproducibly at the low bias\nvoltage range ($\\le$ 0.7 V) for LSVs with relatively low resistance-area\nproduct ($RA$) values ($\\le$ 1 k$\\Omega$$\\mu$m$^{2}$). This means that the\nSchottky tunnel contacts used here are more suitable than ferromagnet/MgO\ntunnel contacts ($RA \\ge$ 100 k$\\Omega$$\\mu$m$^{2}$) for developing Ge\nspintronic applications.\n", "  We present a unique method for solving for the Reynolds stress in turbulent\ncanonical flows, which is based on momentum balance for a control volume moving\nat the local mean velocity. Comparisons with experimental and computational\ndata in simple geometries show quite good agreement. An alternate picture for\nthe turbulence momentum transport is offered, based on the closed-form\nexpression for the Reynolds stress. The turbulence momentum balance is verified\nusing DNS data. This approach has potential applications in aerodynamics, and\nalso represents a possible method for determining the Reynolds stress in more\ncomplex flows.\n", "  The levelling of a thin liquid film has been analysed experimentally,\ntheoretically, and numerically. The purpose of this contribution is to compare\nsolutions from two different finite element models: one based on the 2D\nNavier-Stokes equations, and the other based on a simplification thereof, known\nas the lubrication approximation. The latter is significantly less\ncomputationally expensive, hence it is desirable to know in which parameter\nrange this approximation is valid. As a benchmark problem, we consider the\nclassical dam-break problem. This paper establishes the validity window of the\nlubrication approximation in terms of the Reynolds number, Froude number, and\nfilm aspect ratio. To validate the solutions produced by the solver,\nexperimental data has been obtained for the levelling of silicone oil. The free\nsurface velocity measured experimentally is compared to that produced by the\ntwo numerical models and found to have relatively good agreement. The\nlubrication approximation is then compared with the Navier-Stokes model for a\nrange of Reynolds and Froude numbers, and for a range of film aspect ratios.\nThe results show that the lubrication approximation is remarkably robust and\nparticularly accurate for low Reynolds and Froude numbers, for which inertial\neffects are negligible. Using fixed Reynolds and Froude numbers of 100 and 0.01\nrespectively, the lubrication approximation is accurate for aspect ratios up to\n1%.\n", "  The recombination of charges is an important process in organic photonic\ndevices because the process influences the device characteristics such as the\ndriving voltage, efficiency and lifetime. By combining the dipole trap theory\nwith the drift-diffusion model, we report that the stationary dipole moment\n({\\mu}0) of the dopant is a major factor determining the recombination\nmechanism in the dye-doped organic light emitting diodes when the trap depth\n({\\Delta}Et) is larger than 0.3 eV where any de-trapping effect becomes\nnegligible. Dopants with large {\\mu}0 (e.g., homoleptic Ir(III) dyes) induce\nlarge charge trapping on them, resulting in high driving voltage and\ntrap-assisted-recombination dominated emission. On the other hand, dyes with\nsmall {\\mu}0 (e.g., heteroleptic Ir(III) dyes) show much less trapping on them\nno matter what {\\Delta}Et is, leading to lower driving voltage, higher\nefficiencies and Langevin recombination dominated emission characteristics.\nThis finding will be useful in any organic photonic devices where trapping and\nrecombination sites play key roles.\n", "  A new approach to prevent spurious behavior caused by conventional\nshock-capturing schemes when solving stiff detonation waves problems is\nintroduced in the present work. Due to smearing of discontinuous solution by\nthe excessive numerical dissipation, conventional shock-capturing schemes have\ndifficulties to obtain the correct location of detonation front without enough\ngrids resolution. To overcome the excessive numerical errors around\ndiscontinuities by traditional discretized schemes used in non-reacting high\nspeed compressible flow, we introduce a new shock-capturing scheme in which\nbesides linear function constructed by MUSCL (Monotone Upstream-centered\nSchemes for Conservation Law) scheme, a step like THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola\nfor INterface Capturing) function is also employed as another candidate in the\nreconstruction process. The final reconstruction function is determined by\nboundary variation diminishing (BVD) algorithm by which numerical dissipation\naround discontinuities can be reduced significantly. The new resulted\nshock-capturing scheme is named MUSCL-THINC-BVD. One- and two-dimensional\ncomparative numerical tests about stiff detonation waves problems are conducted\nwith the 5th order WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) and\nMUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme respectively, which show MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme can\ncapture the correct position of detonation waves with improved resolution while\nWENO scheme, in spite of higher order, produces spurious waves. Compared with\nother existing methods which involves extra treatments by accepting the smeared\nout discontinuities profiles, the current method obtain the correct but also\nsharp detonation front by fundamentally reducing numerical dissipation errors\nfrom shock-capturing schemes. Thus the proposed approach is an effective but\nsimple method to solve stiff detonation problems.\n", "  Transverse mode-coupling instability (TMCI) is known to limit bunch\nintensity. Since space charge (SC) changes the spectra of the collective modes,\nit affects the TMCI threshold as well. In agreement with results of M.\nBlaskiewicz and V. Balbekov, we found that, when the wake is negative or it\nessentially negative, the instability threshold increases as fast as the space\ncharge tune shift when the latter is large enough. In contrast, for oscillating\nwakes, when the oscillations are sufficiently pronounced, the threshold\ndependence on SC is non-monotonic; at sufficiently high SC tune shift the\nthreshold goes inversely proportional to that.\n", "  Accelerators and detectors are expensive, both in terms of money and human\neffort. It is thus important to invest effort in performing a good statistical\nanalysis of the data, in order to extract the best information from it. This\nseries of five lectures deals with practical aspects of statistical issues that\narise in typical High Energy Physics analyses.\n", "  We analyze the finite lifetimes of the topologically protected electrons in\nthe surface state of Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 due to elastic scattering off surface\nvacancies and as a function of energy. The scattering rates are decomposed into\nsurface-to-surface and surface-to-bulk contributions, giving us new fundamental\ninsights into the scattering properties of the topological surface states\n(TSS). If the number of possible final bulk states is much larger than the\nnumber of final surface states, then the surface-to-bulk contribution is of\nimportance, otherwise the surface-to-surface contribution dominates.\nAdditionally, we find defect resonances that have a significant impact on the\nscattering properties of the TSS. They can strongly change the lifetime of the\nsurface state to vary between tens of fs to ps at surface defect concentrations\nof 1 at%.\n", "  We investigate an efficient, generic method for evaluating the performance of\nquantum annealing devices that does not require the prior knowledge of the true\nground state of the benchmark problem. This approach exploits symmetry\nproperties inherent to the ground states of a composite Hamiltonian comprising\nthe benchmark problem Hamiltonian and its symmetric counterpart. Using this\nmethod, we compare the performance of two generations of D-Wave machines.\nAlthough the probability of finding solutions with the required symmetry of the\nground states has not been drastically increased, our results suggest that the\ncurrent generation of D-Wave machine notably outperforms its predecessor in\nfinding states closer to those with the required symmetry.\n", "  A junction between two boundaries of a topological superconductor (TSC),\nmediated by localized edge modes of Majorana fermions, is investigated. The\ntunneling of fermions across the junction depends on the magnetic flux. It\nbreaks the time-reversal symmetry at the boundary of the sample. The persistent\ncurrent is determined by the emergence of Majorana edge modes. The structure of\nthe edge modes depends on the magnitude of the tunneling amplitude across the\njunction. It is shown that there are two different regimes, which correspond to\nstrong and weak tunneling of Majorana fermions, distinctive in the persistent\ncurrent behavior. In a strong tunneling regime, the fermion parity of edge\nmodes is not conserved and the persistent current is a $2\\pi$-periodic function\nof the magnetic flux. When the tunneling is weak the chiral Majorana states,\nwhich are propagating along the edges have the same fermion parity. They form a\n$4\\pi$-phase periodic persistent current along the boundaries. The regions in\nthe space of parameters, which correspond to the emergence of $2\\pi$- and of\n$4\\pi$-harmonics, are numerically determined. The peculiarities in the\npersistent current behavior are studied.\n", "  In holography there is a one-to-one correspondence between physical\nobservables in the bulk and boundary theories. To define physical observables,\nhowever, regularisation needs to be implemented in both sides of the\ncorrespondence. It is arguable whether the correspondence should extend to\nregularisation and renormalisation scheme which are not physical in the\nconventional sense. However, if we are to take the renormalisation group (RG)\ninterpretation of holography seriously, its precise understanding appears to\nrequire the matching of regularisations and renormalisation schemes in the bulk\nand boundary theories. We address this question in the AdS_5/CFT_4\ncorrespondence by considering a simplest physical quantity, the Casimir energy\nof the N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory on R x S^3, in a {\\zeta}-function\nregularisation and show that there are choices of scheme which match the bulk\nAdS result including the radial cutoff dependent corrections when the cutoff is\nkept finite. We further discuss the implication of this result to the RG\ninterpretation of holography.\n", "  This is the writeup of the lectures on neutrino physics delivered at various\nschools: TASI and Trieste in 2013 and the CERN-Latin American School in 2015.\nThe topics discussed in this lecture include: general properties of neutrinos\nin the SM, the theory of neutrino masses and mixings (Dirac and Majorana),\nneutrino oscillations both in vacuum and in matter, as well as an overview of\nthe experimental evidence for neutrino masses and of the prospects in neutrino\noscillation physics. We also briefly review the relevance of neutrinos in\nleptogenesis and in beyond-the-Standard-Model physics.\n", "  ALTO is a concept/project in the exploratory phase since 2013 aiming to build\na wide-field VHE gamma-ray observatory at very high altitude in the Southern\nhemisphere. The operation of such an observatory will complement the Northern\nhemisphere observations performed by HAWC and will make possible the\nexploration of the central region of our Galaxy and the hunt for PeVatrons, and\nto search for extended Galactic objects such as the Vela Supernova Remnant and\nthe Fermi bubbles. The ALTO project is aiming for a substantial improvement of\nthe Water Cherenkov Detection Technique by increasing the altitude of the\nobservatory in order to lower the energy threshold, by using a layer of\nscintillator below the water tank to optimize the S/B discrimination, by\nminimizing the size of the tanks and having a more compact array to sample the\nair-shower footprints with better precision, and by using precise electronics\nwhich will provide time-stamped waveforms to improve the angular and energy\nresolution. ALTO is designed to have as low an energy threshold as possible so\nas to act as a fast trigger alert to other observatories, primarily to the\nSouthern part of CTA, for transient Galactic and extra-galactic phenomena. The\nwide FoV resulting from the detection technique allows the survey of a large\nportion of the sky continuously, thus giving the possibility to access emission\nfrom Gamma-Ray Bursts, Active Galactic Nuclei and X-ray binary flares, and\nextended emissions of both Galactic (Vela SNR, Fermi bubbles) and\nextra-galactic (AGN radio lobes) origin. The ALTO observatory will be composed\nof about a thousand detection units, each of which consists of a Water\nCherenkov Detector positioned above a liquid Scintillation Detector,\ndistributed within an area of about 200 m in diameter. The project is in the\ndesign study phase which is soon to be followed by a prototyping phase.\n", "  Ordered FePdCu nanoisland arrays were formed by annealing at 600oC, which\ncaused solid state dewetting of [Cu/Fe/Pd] multilayers deposited on\nself-assembled SiO2 nanospheres with size of 100 nm. A single FePdCu island was\nformed on the top of each SiO2 nanosphere. The structure of the obtained system\nwas studied by x-ray diffraction (XRD), while its magnetic properties by SQUID\nmagnetometry. Partially ordered L10 alloy appeared in the annealed films,\nleading to magnetic hardening of the material. The paper presents the influence\nof the patterning on the system properties. It is shown that templated\ndewetting is a method providing nanoislands with well controlled sizes and\npositions. The role of copper admixture in controlling the structural and\nmagnetic properties is also discussed.\n", "  ALTO is a wide field-of-view air shower detector array for very-high-energy\n(VHE) gamma-ray astronomy, proposed to be installed in the Southern Hemisphere\nat an altitude of about 5.1 km above sea level. The array will use water\nCherenkov detectors, as in the HAWC observatory, but combined with scintillator\ndetectors, to detect air showers induced by VHE gamma rays in the atmosphere.\nIt is being designed to attain a lower energy threshold, better energy and\nangular resolution, and improved sensitivity. The array will consist of about\n1250 small-sized (3.6 m diameter) detector units distributed over a circular\narea of about 160 m in diameter. Each detector unit will consist of a water\nCherenkov detector and a liquid scintillation detector underneath which will\npreferentially identify muons, facilitating the background (cosmic ray)\nrejection, thereby improving the sensitivity. The background rejection will be\nfurther enhanced by the close-packed arrangement and the small size of the\ndetectors which will allow a fine sampling of air-shower footprints at the\nground. In this contribution, we present the Monte-Carlo simulation of the\nexperiment performed using CORSIKA and GEANT4 simulation packages. The expected\nperformance of the array in terms of reconstruction accuracies of the shower\ncore and arrival direction, as well as preliminary estimate of the trigger\nenergy threshold after preliminary selection cuts for a point-like gamma-ray\nsource are presented.\n", "  Permutation patterns-based approaches, such as permutation entropy (PerEn),\nhave been widely and successfully used to analyze data. However, these methods\nhave two main shortcomings. First, when a series is symbolized based on\npermutation patterns, repetition as an unavoidable phenomenon in data is not\ntook in to account. Second, they consider only the order of amplitude values\nand so, some information regarding the amplitude values themselves may be\nignored. To address these deficiencies, we have very recently introduced\ndispersion patterns and subsequently, dispersion entropy (DispEn). In this\npaper, we investigate the effect of different linear and non-linear mapping\napproaches, used in the algorithm of DispEn, on the characterization of\nsignals. We also inspect the sensitivity of different parameters of DispEn to\nnoise. Moreover, we introduce frequency-based DispEn (FDispEn) as a measure to\ndeal with only the frequency of time series. The results suggest that DispEn\nand FDispEn with the log-sigmoid mapping approach, unlike PerEn, can detect\noutliers. Furthermore, the original and frequency-based forbidden dispersion\npatterns are introduced to discriminate deterministic from stochastic time\nseries. The computation times show that DispEn and FDispEn are considerably\nfaster than PerEn. Finally, we find that DispEn and FDispEn outperform PerEn to\ndistinguish various dynamics of biomedical signals. Due to their advantages\nover existing entropy methods, DispEn and FDispEn are expected to be widely\nused for the characterization of a wide variety of real-world time series.\n", "  NIFTy, \"Numerical Information Field Theory\", is a software framework designed\nto ease the development and implementation of field inference algorithms. Field\nequations are formulated independently of the underlying spatial geometry\nallowing the user to focus on the algorithmic design. Under the hood, NIFTy\nensures that the discretization of the implemented equations is consistent.\nThis enables the user to prototype an algorithm rapidly in 1D and then apply it\nto high-dimensional real-world problems. This paper introduces NIFTy 3, a major\nupgrade to the original NIFTy framework. NIFTy 3 allows the user to run\ninference algorithms on massively parallel high performance computing clusters\nwithout changing the implementation of the field equations. It supports\nn-dimensional Cartesian spaces, spherical spaces, power spaces, and product\nspaces as well as transforms to their harmonic counterparts. Furthermore, NIFTy\n3 is able to treat non-scalar fields. The functionality and performance of the\nsoftware package is demonstrated with example code, which implements a real\ninference algorithm from the realm of information field theory. NIFTy 3 is\nopen-source software available under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3)\nat https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/ift/NIFTy/\n", "  Spatio-temporal evolution of a non-relativistic electrostatic waves in a cold\nplasma has been studied in the wave-breaking regime using a 1D particle-in-cell\nsimulation. It is found that plasma gets heated after the wave-breaking but a\nfraction of initial energy always remains with the remnant wave in the form of\nBGK mode in warm plasma. An interesting finding of this work is that the\nfrequency of the resultant BGK wave is found be below electron plasma frequency\nwhich decreases with increasing initial amplitude. Moreover, the acceleration\nmechanism after the wave-breaking is also found to be different from the\nprevious work. In order to explain the results observed in the numerical\nexperiments, a simplified theoretical model is constructed which exhibits a\ngood agreement with the simulation. These investigations have direct relevance\nin wake-field acceleration experiments.\n", "  We consider the linear problem for water-waves created by sources on the\nbottom and the free surface in a 3-D basin having slowly varying profile\n$z=-D(x)$. The fluid verifies Euler-Poisson equations. These (non-linear)\nequations have been given a Hamiltonian form by Zakharov, involving canonical\nvariables $(\\xi(x,t),\\eta(x,t))$ describing the dynamics of the free surface;\nvariables $(\\xi,\\eta)$ are related by the free surface Dirichlet-to-Neumann\n(DtN) operator. For a single variable $x\\in{\\bf R}$ and constant depth, DtN\noperator was explicitely computed in terms of a convergent series. Here we\nneglect quadratic terms in Zakharov equations, and consider the linear response\nto a disturbance of $D(x)$ harmonic in time when the wave-lenght is small\ncompared to the depth of the basin. We solve the Green function problem for a\nmatrix-valued DtN operator, at the bottom and the free-surface.\n", "  We recall the motivations for the Compositeness Standard Model(CSM) concept,\nits precise description, the procedures for its applications and the particular\nconstraints that it requires. We present its most spectacular predictions for\ntypical processes observable at present and future colliders. To the previous\nresults we add the treatment of the inclusive processes $e^+e^- \\to H,Z,W~or~t+\nanything$.\n", "  We study the spontaneous symmetry breaking of dipolar Bose--Einstein\ncondensates trapped in stacks of two-well systems, which may be effectively\nbuilt as one-dimensional trapping lattices sliced by a repelling laser sheet.\nIf the potential wells are sufficiently deep, the system is modeled by coupled\ndiscrete Gross--Pitaevskii equations with nonlocal self- and cross-interaction\nterms representing dipole--dipole interactions. When the dipoles are not\npolarized perpendicular or parallel to the lattice, the cross-interaction is\nasymmetric, replacing the familiar symmetric two-component solitons with a new\nspecies of cross-symmetric or -asymmetric ones. The orientation of the dipole\nmoments and the interwell hopping rate strongly affect the shapes of the\ndiscrete two-component solitons as well as the characteristics of the\ncross-symmetry breaking and the associated phase transition. The sub- and\nsuper-critical types of cross-symmetry breaking can be controlled by either the\nhopping rate between the components or the total norm of the solitons. The\neffect of the interplay between the contact nonlinearity and the dipole angle\non the cross-symmetry breaking is also discussed.\n", "  The European School of High-Energy Physics is intended to give young\nphysicists an introduction to the the- oretical aspects of recent advances in\nelementary particle physics. These proceedings contain lecture notes on the\ntheory of quantum chromodynamics, Higgs physics, Flavour physics and CP\nviolation, and Supersymmetry.\n", "  These proceedings are of interest to staff and students in accelerator\nlaboratories, university departments and companies working in or having an\ninterest in the field of new acceleration techniques. Following introductory\nlectures on plasma and laser physics, the course covers the different\ncomponents of a plasma wake accelerator and plasma beam systems. Topical\nseminars and an overview about alternative new techniques like dielectric\naccelerators are included. Lectures on the experimental studies and their\nlatest results, on diagnostic tools and state of the art wake acceleration\nfacilities, both present and planned, complement the theoretical part.\n", "  We study quantum transport through two-terminal nanoscale devices in contact\nwith two particle reservoirs at different temperatures and chemical potentials.\nWe discuss the general expressions controlling the electric charge current,\nheat currents and the efficiency of energy transmutation in steady conditions\nin the linear regime.\n  With focus in the parameter domain where the electron system acts as a\npower-generator, we elaborate workable expressions for optimal efficiency and\nthermoelectric pameters of nanoscale devices. The general concepts are set at\nwork in the paradigmatic cases of Lorentzian resonances and antiresonances, and\nthe encompassing Fano transmission function: the treatments are fully analytic,\nin terms of the trigamma functions and Bernoulli numbers. From the general\ncurves here reported describing transport through the above model transmission\nfunctions, useful guidelines for optimal efficiency and thermopower can be\ninferred for engineering nanoscale devices in energy regions where they show\nsimilar transmission functions.\n", "  Molecular Dynamics (MD) codes predict the fundamental properties of matter by\nfollowing the trajectories of a collection of interacting model particles. To\nexploit diverse modern manycore hardware, efficient codes must use all\navailable parallelism. At the same time they need to be portable and easily\nextendible by the domain specialist (physicist/chemist) without detailed\nknowledge of this hardware. To address this challenge, we recently described a\nnew Domain Specific Language (DSL) for the development of performance portable\nMD codes based on a \"Separation of Concerns\": a Python framework automatically\ngenerates efficient parallel code for a range of target architectures.\n  Electrostatic interactions between charged particles are important in many\nphysical systems and often dominate the runtime. Here we discuss the inclusion\nof long-range interaction algorithms in our code generation framework. These\nalgorithms require global communications and careful consideration has to be\ngiven to any impact on parallel scalability. We implemented an Ewald summation\nalgorithm for electrostatic forces, present scaling comparisons for different\nsystem sizes and compare to the performance of existing codes. We also report\non further performance optimisations delivered with OpenMP shared memory\nparallelism.\n", "  The solar wind is highly structured in fast and slow flows. These two\ndynamical regimes remarkably differ not only for the average values of magnetic\nfield and plasma parameters but also for the type of fluctuations they\ntransport. Fast wind is characterized by large amplitude, incompressible\nfluctuations, mainly Alfv\\'{e}nic, slow wind is generally populated by smaller\namplitude and less Alfv\\'{e}nic fluctuations, mainly compressive. The typical\ncorotating fast stream is characterized by a stream interface, a fast wind\nregion and a slower rarefaction region formed by the trailing expansion edge of\nthe stream. Moving {between these two regions}, from faster to slower wind, we\nobserve the following behavior: a) the power level of magnetic fluctuations\nwithin the inertial range largely decreases, keeping the typical Kolmogorov\nscaling; b) at proton scales, for about one decade right beyond the high\nfrequency break, the spectral index becomes flatter and flatter towards a value\naround -2.7; c) at higher frequencies, before the electron scales, the spectral\nindex remains around -2.7 and, {based on suitable observations available for\n$4$ corotating streams}, the power level does not change, irrespective of the\nflow speed. All these spectral features, characteristic of high speed streams,\nsuggest the existence of a sort of magnetic field background spectrum. This\nspectrum would be common to both faster and slower wind but, any time the\nobserver would cross the inner part of a fluxtube channeling the faster wind\ninto the interplanetary space, a turbulent and large amplitude Alfv\\'{e}nic\nspectrum would be superposed to it.\n", "  This short note presents some variant schemes of boundary variation\ndiminishing (BVD) algorithm in one dimension with the results of numerical\ntests for linear advection equation to facilitate practical use. In spite of\nbeing presented in 1D fashion, all the schemes are simple and easy to implement\nin multi-dimensions on structured and unstructured grids for nonlinear and\nsystem equations.\n", "  Theoretical arguments and cosmological observations suggest that Einstein's\ntheory of general relativity needs to be modified at high energies. One of the\nbest motivated higher-curvature extensions of general relativity is\nEinstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, in which a scalar field is coupled to\nquadratic curvature invariants. This theory is inspired by an effective\nstring-theory model and its predictions dramatically differ from Einstein's\ntheory in high-curvature regions - such as the interior of black holes and the\nearly universe - where it aims at resolving curvature singularities. In this\nwork we derive cosmological solutions in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity\nfor quadratic and for exponential coupling functions, and for any spatial\ncurvature. We discuss already known solutions and find new nonsingular,\ninflationary, and bouncing solutions. We study the linear stability of these\nsolutions and the absence of ghosts, finding that all the aforementioned\nsolutions are unstable against tensor perturbations. We then introduce a\nsimple, quadratic potential for the scalar field. In some cases the presence of\na mass term cures the tensor instability. The proposed model is therefore a\nviable and attractive candidate for inflation, and one in which the scalar\nfield is naturally provided by the gravitational sector.\n", "  The optical observations of wide fields of view encounter the problem of\nselection of best exposure time. As there are usually plenty of objects\nobserved simultaneously, the quality of photometry of the brightest ones is\nalways better than of the dimmer ones. Frequently all of them are equally\ninteresting for the astronomers and thus it is desired to have all of them\nmeasured with the highest possible accuracy.\n  In this paper we present a novel optimization algorithm dedicated for the\ndivision of exposure time into sub-exposures, which allows to perform\nphotometry with more balanced noise budget. Thanks to the proposed technique,\nthe photometric precision of dimmer objects is increased at the expense of the\nmeasurement fidelity of the brightest ones. We tested the method on real\nobservations using two telescope setups demonstrating its usefulness and good\nagreement with the theoretical expectations. The main application of our\napproach is a wide range of sky surveys, including the ones performed by the\nspace telescopes. The method can be applied for planning virtually any\nphotometric observations, in which the objects of interest show a wide range of\nmagnitudes.\n", "  Fe$_{2}$VAl and Fe$_{2}$TiSn are full Heusler compounds with non-magnetic\nground state. The two compouds are good thermoelectric materials. PBE and\nLDA(PW92) are the two most commonly used density functionals to study the\nHeusler compounds. Along with these two well studied exchange-correlation\nfunctionals, recently developed PBEsol, mBJ and SCAN functionals are employed\nto study the two compounds. Using the five functionals equilibrium lattice\nparameter and bulk modulus are calculated. Obtained values are compared with\nexperimental reports wherever available. Electronic structure properties are\nstudied by calculating dispersion curves, total and partial density of states.\nFor Fe$_{2}$VAl, band gap of 0.22 eV is obtained from the mBJ potential which\nis in reasonable agreement with experimental value while, for Fe$_{2}$TiSn band\ngap of 0.68 eV is obtained. Fe$_{2}$VAl is predicted to be semimetallic with\ndifferent values of negative gaps from LDA,PBEsol,PBE and SCAN functionals.\nWhereas, Fe$_{2}$TiSn is found to be semimetallic(semiconducting) from\nLDA,PBEsol(PBE,SCAN) functionals employed calculations. From the dispersion\ncurve effective mass values are also computed to see the contribution to the\nSeebeck coefficient. In Fe$_{2}$TiSn, a flat band is present along the\n$\\Gamma$-X direction with calculated value of effective mass $\\sim$36 more than\nthe mass of electron. The improvements or inadequacies among the functionals in\nexplaining the properties of full Heusler alloys for thermoelectric application\nare thus observed through this study.\n", "  Galaxy mergers play a crucial role in the formation of massive galaxies and\nthe buildup of their bulges. An important aspect of the merging process is the\nin-spiral of the supermassive black-holes (SMBHs) to the centre of the merger\nremnant and the eventual formation of a SMBH binary. If both the SMBHs are\naccreting they will form a dual or binary active galactic nucleus (DAGN). The\nfinal merger remnant is usually very bright and shows enhanced star formation.\nIn this paper we summarize the current sample of DAGN from previous studies and\ndescribe methods that can be used to identify strong DAGN candidates from\noptical and spectroscopic surveys. These methods depend on the Doppler\nseparation of the double peaked AGN emission lines, the nuclear velocity\ndispersion of the galaxies and their optical/UV colours. We describe two high\nresolution, radio observations of DAGN candidates that have been selected based\non their double peaked optical emission lines (DPAGN). We also examine whether\nDAGN host galaxies have higher star formation rates (SFRs) compared to merging\ngalaxies that do not appear to have DAGN. We find that the SFR is not higher\nfor DAGN host galaxies. This suggests that the SFRs in DAGN host galaxies is\ndue to the merging process itself and not related to the presence of two AGN in\nthe system.\n", "  In this paper, results of quantum calculations are presented for feedback\ncooling of an optically trapped nanoparticle in the laser-shot-noise-dominant\nregime. We numerically investigate the system using both parametric and force\nfeedback cooling schemes. For the same measurement efficiency, the cooling\nlimit from the force feedback is lower than that from the parametric feedback.\nWe also develop a set of semi-classical equations for feedback cooling that\naccurately match the quantum results. It is demonstrated, by rescaling the\nsemi-classical equations, that the cooling dynamics is uniquely determined by\nthe parameter set: the feedback strength, the measurement efficiency and the\nchange of occupation number over one oscillation period due to the shot noise.\nThe minimum occupation number is determined by the measurement efficiency and\nthe change of occupation number over one period.\n", "  We propose a mathematical model for computing drug release from multi-layer\ncapsules. The diffusion problem in such heterogeneous layer-by-layer composite\nmedium is described by a system of coupled partial differential equations,\nwhich we solve analytically using separation of variables. In addition to the\nconventional interlayer continuous mass transfer boundary conditions, we\nconsider also the case of finite mass transfer resistance, which corresponds to\nthe case of a coated capsule. The drug concentration in the core and through\nall layers, as well as in the external release medium, is then given in terms\nof a Fourier series that we compute numerically to characterize the drug\nrelease mechanism.\n", "  We measured the work of separation of single and few-layer MoS2 membranes\nfrom a SiOx substrate using a mechanical blister test, and found a value of 220\n+- 35 mJ/m^2. Our measurements were also used to determine the 2D Young's\nmodulus of a single MoS2 layer to be 160 +- 40 N/m. We then studied the\ndelamination mechanics of pressurized MoS2 bubles, demonstrating both stable\nand unstable transitions between the bubbles' laminated and delaminated states\nas the bubbles were inflated. When they were deflated, we observed edge pinning\nand a snap-in transition which are not accounted for by the previously reported\nmodels. We attribute this result to adhesion hysteresis and use our results to\nestimate the work of adhesion of our membranes to be 42 +- 20 mJ/m^2.\n"]}
