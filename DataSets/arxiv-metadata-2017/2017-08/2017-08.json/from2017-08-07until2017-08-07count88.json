The spectrum and results are generally consistent with previous\nresults, though the power spectrum error bars are slightly smaller and there\nare small shifts at high ell. The small improvement in error bars is obtained\nat very low numerical cost but does not significantly improve parameter\nconstraints. I discuss the accuracy of the likelihood model and how constraints\non the optical depth translate into constraints on the reionization history\nallowing for helium reionization. In the appendices I propose a simple\nreionization parameterization that determines the history in terms of a\nmid-point reionization redshift, and suggest a new likelihood approximation for\nchi-squared-like distributions with varying skewness.\n", "  We demonstrate nuclear double resonance for nanometer-scale volumes of spins\nwhere random fluctuations rather than Boltzmann polarization dominate. When the\nHartmann-Hahn condition is met in a cross-polarization experiment, flip-flops\noccur between two species of spins and their fluctuations become coupled. We\nuse magnetic resonance force microscopy to measure this effect between 1H and\n13C spins in 13C-enriched stearic acid. The development of a cross-polarization\ntechnique for statistical ensembles adds an important tool for generating\nchemical contrast in nanometer-scale magnetic resonance.\n", "  The observation of the $Y(4140)$ structure in $B^\\pm\\rightarrow J/\\psi\\,\\phi\nK^\\pm$ decays produced in $\\bar{p} p $ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=1.96~\\TeV$ is\nreported with a statistical significance greater than 5 standard deviations. A\nfit to the $J/\\psi\\,\\phi$ mass spectrum is performed assuming the presence of a\nBreit-Wigner resonance. The fit yields a signal of $19^{+6}_{-5}$ resonance\nevents, and resonance mass and width of\n  $4143.4^{+2.9}_{-3.0}(\\mathrm{stat})\\pm0.6(\\mathrm{syst})~\\MeVcc$ and\n$15.3^{+10.4}_{-6.1}(\\mathrm{stat})\\pm2.5(\\mathrm{syst})~\\MeVcc$ respectively.\nThe parameters of this resonance-like structure are consistent with values\nreported from an earlier CDF analysis.\n", "  We consider discrete Schr\\\"odinger operators of the form $H=-\\Delta +V$ on\n$\\ell^2(\\Z^d)$, where $\\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian and $V$ is a bounded\npotential. Given $\\Gamma \\subset \\Z^d$, the $\\Gamma$-trimming of $H$ is the\nrestriction of $H$ to $\\ell^2(\\Z^d\\setminus\\Gamma)$, denoted by $H_\\Gamma$. We\ninvestigate the dependence of the ground state energy $E_\\Gamma(H)=\\inf \\sigma\n(H_\\Gamma)$ on $\\Gamma$. We show that for relatively dense proper subsets\n$\\Gamma$ of $\\Z^d$ we always have $E_\\Gamma(H)>E_\\emptyset(H)$. We use this\nlifting of the ground state energy to establish Wegner estimates and\nlocalization at the bottom of the spectrum for $\\Gamma$-trimmed Anderson\nmodels, i.e., Anderson models with the random potential supported by the set\n$\\Gamma$\n", "  The nuclear spins in nanostructured semiconductors play a central role in\nquantum applications. The nuclear spins represent a useful resource for\ngenerating local magnetic fields but nuclear spin noise represents a major\nsource of dephasing for spin qubits. Controlling the nuclear spins enhances the\nresource while suppressing the noise. NMR techniques are challenging: the group\nIII and V isotopes have large spins with widely different gyromagnetic ratios;\nin strained material there are large atom-dependent quadrupole shifts; and\nnanoscale NMR is hard to detect. We report NMR on 100,000 nuclear spins of a\nquantum dot using chirped radiofrequency pulses. Following polarization, we\ndemonstrate a reversal of the nuclear spin. We can flip the nuclear spin back\nand forth a hundred times.We demonstrate that chirped NMR is a powerful way of\ndetermining the chemical composition, the initial nuclear spin temperatures and\nquadrupole frequency distributions for all the main isotopes. The key\nobservation is a plateau in the NMR signal as a function of sweep rate: we\nachieve inversion at the first quantum transition for all isotopes\nsimultaneously. These experiments represent a generic technique for\nmanipulating nanoscale inhomogeneous nuclear spin ensembles and open the way to\nprobe the coherence of such mesoscopic systems.\n", "  We explore the properties of discrete random Schroedinger operators in which\nthe random part of the potential is supported on a sub-lattice. In particular,\nwe provide new conditions on the sub-lattice under which Anderson localisation\nhappens at strong disorder, and provide examples in which it can be ruled out.\n", "  By using a phase-field crystal (PFC) model, the liquid-crystal growth of the\nplastic triangular phase is simulated with emphasis on crystal shape and\ntopological defect formation. The equilibrium shape of a plastic triangular\ncrystal (PTC) grown from a isotropic phase is compared with that grown from a\ncolumnar/smectic A (CSA) phase. While the shape of a PTC nucleus in the\nisotropic phase is almost identical to that of a classical PFC model, the shape\nof a PTC nucleus in CSA is affected by the orientation of stripes in the CSA\nphase, and irregular hexagonal, elliptical, octagonal, and rectangular shapes\nare obtained. Concerning the dynamics of the growth process we analyse the\ntopological structure of the nematic-order, which starts from nucleation of\n$+\\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\\frac{1}{2}$ disclination pairs at the PTC growth front\nand evolves into hexagonal cells consisting of $+1$ vortices surrounded by six\nsatellite $-\\frac{1}{2}$ disclinations. It is found that the orientational and\nthe positional order do not evolve simultaneously, the orientational order\nevolves behind the positional order, leading to a large transition zone, which\ncan span over several lattice spacings.\n", "  We study experimental and cosmological constraints on the extension of the\nStandard Model by three right handed neutrinos with masses between those of the\npion and W boson. We combine for the first time direct, indirect and\ncosmological constraints in this mass range. This includes experimental\nconstraints from neutrino oscillation data, neutrinoless double $\\beta$ decay,\nelectroweak precision data, lepton universality, searches for rare lepton\ndecays, tests of CKM unitarity and past direct searches at colliders or fixed\ntarget experiments. On the cosmological side, big bang nucleosynthesis has the\nmost pronounced impact. Our results can be used to evaluate the discovery\npotential of searches for heavy neutrinos at LHCb, BELLE II, SHiP, ATLAS, CMS\nor a future lepton collider.\n", "  In this work we establish a density-functional reformulation of coupled\nmatter-photon problems subject to general external electromagnetic fields and\ncharge currents. We first show that for static minimally-coupled matter-photon\nsystems an external electromagnetic field is equivalent to an external charge\ncurrent. We employ this to show that scalar external potentials and transversal\nexternal charge currents are in a one-to-one correspondence to the expectation\nvalues of the charge density and the vector-potential of the correlated\nmatter-photon ground state. This allows to establish a Maxwell-Kohn-Sham\napproach, where in conjunction with the usual single-particle Kohn-Sham\nequations a classical Maxwell equation has to be solved. In the magnetic\nmean-field limit this reduces to a current-density-functional theory that does\nnot suffer from non-uniqueness problems and if furthermore the magnetic field\nis zero recovers standard density-functional theory.\n", "  We introduce a new approach for proving localization (pure point spectrum\nwith exponentially decaying eigenfunctions, dynamical localization) for the\nAnderson model at high disorder. In contrast to the usual strategy, we do not\nstudy finite volume Green's functions. Instead, we perform a multiscale\nanalysis based on finite volume eigensystems (eigenvalues and eigenfunctions).\nInformation about eigensystems at a given scale is used to derive information\nabout eigensystems at larger scales. This eigensystem multiscale analysis\ntreats all energies of the finite volume operator at the same time,\nestablishing level spacing and localization of eigenfunctions in a fixed box\nwith high probability. A new feature is the labeling of the eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions by the sites of the box.\n", "  Isolation of a system from its environment is often desirable, from precision\nmeasurements to control of individual quantum systems; however, dissipation can\nalso be a useful resource. Remarkably, engineered dissipation enables the\npreparation of quantum states of atoms, ions or superconducting qubits as well\nas their stabilization. This is achieved by a suitably engineered coupling to a\ndissipative cold reservoir formed by electromagnetic modes. Similarly, in the\nfield of cavity electro- and optomechanics, the control over mechanical\noscillators utilizes the inherently cold, dissipative nature of the\nelectromagnetic degree of freedom. Breaking from this paradigm, recent\ntheoretical work has considered the opposite regime in which the dissipation of\nthe mechanical oscillator dominates and provides a cold, dissipative reservoir\nto an electromagnetic mode. Here we realize this reversed dissipation regime in\na microwave cavity optomechanical system and realize a quasi-instantaneous,\ncold reservoir for microwave light. Coupling to this reservoir enables to\nmanipulate the susceptibility of the microwave cavity, corresponding to\ndynamical backaction control of the microwave field. Additionally, we observe\nthe onset of parametric instability, i.e. the stimulated emission of microwaves\n(masing). Equally important, the reservoir can function as a useful quantum\nresource. We evidence this by employing the engineered cold reservoir to\nimplement a large gain (above 40 dB) phase preserving microwave amplifier that\noperates 0.87 quanta above the limit of added noise imposed by quantum\nmechanics. Such a dissipative cold reservoir forms the basis of microwave\nentanglement schemes, the study of dissipative quantum phase transitions,\namplifiers with unlimited gain-bandwidth product and non-reciprocal devices,\nthereby extending the available toolbox of quantum-limited microwave\nmanipulation techniques.\n", "  Background: Neutron stars are astronomical systems with nucleons submitted to\nextreme conditions. Due to the long range coulomb repulsion between protons,\nthe system has structural inhomogeneities. These structural inhomogeneities\narise also in expanding systems, where the fragment distribution is highly\ndependent on the thermodynamic conditions (temperature, proton fraction, ...)\nand the expansion velocity.\n  Purpose: We aim to find the different regimes of fragment distribution, and\nthe existence of infinite clusters.\n  Method: We study the dynamics of the nucleons with a semiclassical molecular\ndynamics model. Starting with an equilibrium configuration, we expand the\nsystem homogeneously until we arrive to an asymptotic configuration (i. e. very\nlow final densities). We study the fragment distribution throughout this\nexpansion.\n  Results: We found the typical regimes of the asymptotic fragment distribution\nof an expansion: u-shaped, power law and exponential. Another key feature in\nour calculations is that, since the interaction between protons is long range\nrepulsive, we do not have always an infinite fragment. We found that, as\nexpected, the faster the expansion velocity is, the quicker the infinite\nfragment disappears.\n  Conclusions: We have developed a novel graph-based tool for the\nidentification of infinite fragments, and found a transition from U-shaped to\nexponential fragment mass distribution with increasing expansion rate.\n", "  Kitaev's honeycomb lattice spin model is a remarkable exactly solvable model,\nwhich has a particular type of spin liquid (Kitaev spin liquid) as the ground\nstate. Although its possible realization in iridates and $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has\nbeen vigorously discussed recently, these materials have substantial non-Kitaev\ndirect exchange interactions and do not have a spin liquid ground state. We\npropose metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with Ru$^{3+}$ (or Os$^{3+}$) forming\nthe honeycomb lattice as promising candidates for a more ideal realization of\nKitaev-type spin models where the direct exchange interaction is strongly\nsuppressed. The great flexibility of MOFs allows generalization to other\nthree-dimensional lattices, for potential realization of a variety of spin\nliquids such as a Weyl spin liquid.\n", "  Coherence, the stability of the relative phase between quantum states, lies\nat the heart of quantum mechanics. Applications such as precision measurement,\ninterferometry, and quantum computation are enabled by physical systems that\nhave quantum states with robust coherence. With the creation of molecular\nensembles at sub-$\\mu$K temperatures, diatomic molecules have become a novel\nsystem under full quantum control. Here, we report on the observation of stable\ncoherence between a pair of nuclear spin states of ultracold fermionic NaK\nmolecules in the singlet rovibrational ground state. Employing microwave\nfields, we perform Ramsey spectroscopy and observe coherence times on the scale\nof one second. This work opens the door for the exploration of single molecules\nas a versatile quantum memory. Switchable long-range interactions between\ndipolar molecules can further enable two-qubit gates, allowing quantum storage\nand processing in the same physical system. Within the observed coherence time,\n$10^4$ one- and two-qubit gate operations will be feasible.\n", "  Private comparison is a primitive for many cryptographic tasks, and recently\nseveral schemes for the quantum private comparison (QPC) have been proposed,\nwhere two users can compare the equality of their secrets with the help of a\nsemi-honest third party (TP) without knowing each other's secret and without\ndisclosing the same to the TP. In the exisiting schemes, secrecy is obtained by\nusing conjugate coding, and considering all participants as quantum users who\ncan perform measurement(s) and/or create states in basis other than\ncomputational basis. In contrast, here we propose two new protocols for QPC,\nfirst of which does not use conjugate coding (uses orthogonal states only) and\nthe second one allows the users other than TP to be classical whose activities\nare restricted to either reflecting a quantum state or measuring it in\ncomputational basis. Further, the performance of the protocols is evaluated\nunder various noise models.\n", "  We consider the numerical investigation of surface bound orientational order\nusing unit tangential vector fields by means of a gradient-flow equation of a\nweak surface Frank-Oseen energy. The energy is composed of intrinsic and\nextrinsic contributions, as well as a penalization term to enforce the unity of\nthe vector field. Four different numerical discretizations, namely a discrete\nexterior calculus approach, a method based on vector spherical harmonics, a\nsurface finite-element method, and an approach utilizing an implicit surface\ndescription, the diffuse interface method, are described and compared with each\nother for surfaces with Euler characteristic 2. We demonstrate the influence of\ngeometric properties on realizations of the Poincare-Hopf theorem and show\nexamples where the energy is decreased by introducing additional orientational\ndefects.\n", "  Tensor network models reproduce important structural features of holography,\nincluding the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy and quantum\nerror correction in the entanglement wedge. Yet only little is known about\ntheir multipartite entanglement structure, which has been of considerable\nrecent interest. In this work, we study tensor networks formed from random\nstabilizer states and show that here the tripartite entanglement question has a\nsharp answer: The average number of GHZ triples that can be extracted from a\nstabilizer tensor network is small, implying that the entanglement is\npredominantly bipartite. Previously, such a result was only known for single\ntensors. As a consequence, we obtain a new operational interpretation of the\nmonogamy of the Ryu-Takayanagi mutual information and an entropic diagnostic\nfor higher-partite entanglement. To establish our results, we derive a\nferromagnetic spin model for the average tripartite entanglement of stabilizer\ntensor networks and develop novel techniques for evaluating higher moments of\nrandom stabilizer states.\n", "  In this paper we introduce a two-component system, depending on a parameter\n$b$, which generalises the Camassa-Holm ($b=1$) and Novikov equations ($b=2$).\nBy investigating its Lie algebra of classical and higher symmetries up to order\n$3$, we found that for $b\\neq 2$ the system admits a $3$-dimensional algebra of\npoint symmetries and apparently no higher symmetries, whereas for $b=2$ it has\na $6$-dimensional algebra of point symmetries and also higher order symmetries.\nAlso we provide all conservation laws, with first order characteristics, which\nare admitted by the system for $b=1,2$. In addition, for $b=2$, we show that\nthe system is a particular instance of a more general system which admits an\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(3,\\mathbb{R})$-valued zero-curvature representation. Finally, we\nfound that the system admits peakon solutions and, in particular, for $b=2$\nthere exist 1-peakon solutions with non-constant amplitude.\n", "  Entropy plays a key role in statistical physics of complex systems, which in\ngeneral exhibit diverse aspects of emergence on different scales. However, it\nstill remains not fully resolved how entropy varies with the coarse-graining\nlevel and the description scale. In this paper, we consider a Yule-type growth\nmodel, where each element is characterized by its size being either continuous\nor discrete. Entropy is then defined directly from the probability distribution\nof the states of all elements as well as from the size distribution of the\nsystem. Probing in detail their relations and time evolutions, we find that\nheterogeneity in addition to correlations between elements could induce loss of\ninformation during the coarse-graining procedure. It is also revealed that the\nexpansion of the size space domain depends on the description level, leading to\na difference between the continuous description and the discrete one.\n", "  We provide an $A_4$ based flavor symmetric scenario to accommodate the\ninverse seesaw mechanism for explaining light neutrino masses and mixing. We\nfind that the lepton mixing, in particular the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern and\nits deviation through nonzero $\\theta_{13}$, is originated solely from the\nflavor structure of the lepton number violating contribution of the neutral\nlepton mass matrix. Here we discuss in detail how a nonzero value of\n$\\theta_{13}$ is correlated with the other parameters in the framework and its\nimpact on the Dirac CP phase $\\delta$. We also analyze the non-unitarity\neffects on lepton mixing matrix and its implication in terms of the lepton\nflavor violating decays, etc..\n", "  A plastic scintillator bar with dimensions 300 cm x 2.5 cm x 11 cm was\nexposed to a focused muon beam to study its light yield and timing\ncharacteristics as a function of position and angle of incidence. The\nscintillating light was read out at both ends by photomultiplier tubes whose\npulse shapes were recorded by waveform digitizers. Results obtained with the\nWAVECATCHER and SAMPIC digitizers are analyzed and compared. A discussion of\nthe various factors affecting the timing resolution is presented. Prospects for\napplications of plastic scintillator technology in large-scale particle physics\ndetectors with timing resolution around 100 ps are provided in light of the\nresults.\n", "  We report an experimental realisation of a quantum random number generator\nusing a plasmonic beamsplitter. Free-space single photons are converted into\npropagating single surface plasmon polaritons on a gold stripe waveguide via a\ngrating. The surface plasmons are then guided to a region where they are\nscattered into one of two possible outputs. The presence of a plasmonic\nexcitation in a given output determines the value of a random bit generated\nfrom the quantum scattering process. Using a stream of single surface plasmons\ninjected into the beamsplitter we achieve a quantum random number generation\nrate of 2.37 Mbits/s even in the presence of loss. We characterise the quality\nof the random number sequence generated, finding it to be comparable to\nsequences from other quantum photonic-based devices. The compact nature of our\nnanophotonic device makes it suitable for tight integration in on-chip\napplications, such as in quantum computing and communication schemes.\n", "  In Bayesian statistics probability distributions express beliefs. However,\nfor many problems the beliefs cannot be computed analytically and\napproximations of beliefs are needed. We seek a loss function that quantifies\nhow \"embarrassing\" it is to communicate a given approximation. We reproduce and\ndiscuss an old proof showing that there is only one ranking under the\nrequirements that (1) the best ranked approximation is the non-approximated\nbelief and (2) that the ranking judges approximations only by their predictions\nfor actual outcomes. The loss function that is obtained in the derivation is\nequal to the Kullback-Leibler divergence when normalized. This loss function is\nfrequently used in the literature. However, there seems to be confusion about\nthe correct order in which its functional arguments, the approximated and\nnon-approximated beliefs, should be used. The correct order ensures that the\nrecipient of a communication is only deprived of the minimal amount of\ninformation. We hope that the elementary derivation settles the apparent\nconfusion. For example when approximating beliefs with Gaussian distributions\nthe optimal approximation is given by moment matching. This is in contrast to\nmany suggested computational schemes.\n", "  Subradiant excitations, originally predicted by Dicke, have posed a\nlong-standing challenge in physics owing to their weak radiative coupling to\nenvironment. Here we engineer massive subradiance in planar metamaterial arrays\nas a spatially extended eigenmode comprising over 1000 metamolecules. By\ncomparing the near- and far-field response in large-scale numerical simulations\nwith those in experimental observations we identify correlated\nmultimetamolecule subradiant states that dominate the total excitation energy.\nWe show that spatially extended many-body subradiance can also exist in\nplasmonic metamaterial arrays at optical frequencies.\n", "  Indirect detection of dark matter is a major avenue for discovery. However,\nbaryonic backgrounds are diverse enough to mimic many possible signatures of\ndark matter. In this work, we study the newly proposed technique of dark matter\nvelocity spectroscopy\\,\\cite{speckhard2016}. The non-rotating dark matter halo\nand the Solar motion produce a distinct longitudinal dependence of the signal\nwhich is opposite in direction to that produced by baryons. Using collisionless\ndark matter only simulations of Milky Way like halos, we show that this new\nsignature is robust and holds great promise. We develop mock observations by\nhigh energy resolution X-ray spectrometer on a sounding rocket, the Micro-X\nexperiment, to our test case, the 3.5 keV line. We show that by using six\ndifferent pointings, Micro-X can exclude a constant line energy over various\nlongitudes at $\\geq$ 3$\\sigma$. The halo triaxiality is an important effect and\nit will typically reduce the significance of this signal. We emphasize that\nthis new {\\it smoking gun in motion} signature of dark matter is general, and\nis applicable to any dark matter candidate which produces a sharp photon\nfeature in annihilation or decay.\n", "  Nanostructured and architectured copper niobium composite wires are excellent\ncandidates for the generation of intense pulsed magnetic fields (>90T) as they\ncombine both high strength and high electrical conductivity. Multi-scaled Cu-Nb\nwires are fabricated by accumulative drawing and bundling (a severe plastic\ndeformation technique), leading to a multiscale, architectured, and\nnanostructured microstructure exhibiting a strong fiber crystallographic\ntexture and elongated grain shapes along the wire axis. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive study of the effective elastic behavior of this composite\nmaterial by three multi-scale models accounting for different microstructural\ncontents: two mean-field models and a full-field finite element model. As the\nspecimens exhibit many characteristic scales, several scale transition steps\nare carried out iteratively from the grain scale to the macro-scale. The\ngeneral agreement among the model responses allows suggesting the best strategy\nto estimate the effective behavior of Cu-Nb wires and save computational time.\nThe importance of crystallographical and morphological textures in various\ncases is discussed. Finally, the models are validated by available experimental\ndata with a good agreement.\n", "  Neutrons travel along straight lines in free space, but only survive for a\ndistance which depends on their energy. Thus, detecting neutrons in space in\nprinciple provides directional and distance information. Apart from secondary\nneutrons produced by cosmic-ray interactions in the Earth atmosphere, which are\nthe dominant background, direct neutron emission is caused by solar flares,\nwith clear time correlation with X-rays, which can be measured from few tens\nMeV up to few GeV. There is no detectable astrophysical source up to the PeV\nscale, when neutrons coming from supernova remnants may reach the Earth before\ndecaying. In addition, ultra high energy neutrons are the most plausible\nexplanation for the measured anisotropy of cosmic-ray showers produced in the\natmosphere above $10^{18}$ eV. From the GeV to the PeV scale, the expected\nneutron flux is very low and not too different from the antiproton flux, as the\nsame cosmic-ray collisions with the interstellar medium which can produce\nantiprotons can also produce neutrons and antineutrons. This background flux of\ncosmic-ray neutrons is very low and has not yet been detected. Measuring the\nneutron energy spectrum in space is a very effective way of searching for\ndecays of exotic particles. For example, dark matter could consist of Weakly\nInteracting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which may annihilate into final states\nwith particle and antiparticle pairs. Consequently, a number of indirect WIMP\nsearches are being carried on, focusing on positron and antiproton spectra.\nHowever, no experiment is presently foreseen to look for \"bumps\" in the neutron\nenergy spectrum, which is virtually background free. Here we consider the\nimplications of a measurement of the neutron energy spectrum in astronomy and\nastrophysics and list the interesting energy regions in the search for WIMPs.\n", "  In the presence of an applied magnetic field introducing Zeeman spin\nsplitting, a superconducting (SC) proximitized one-dimensional (1D) nanowire\nwith spin-orbit coupling can pass through a topological quantum phase\ntransition developing zero-energy topological Majorana bound states (MBSs) on\nthe wire ends. One of the promising experimental platforms in this context is a\nCoulomb blockaded island, where by measuring the two-terminal conductance one\ncan in principle investigate the MBS properties. We theoretically study the\ntunneling transport of a single electron across the superconducting Coulomb\nblockaded nanowire at finite temperature to obtain the generic conductance\nequation. By considering all possible scenarios where only MBSs are present at\nthe ends of the nanowire, we compute the nanowire conductance as a function of\nthe magnetic field, the temperature, and the gate voltage. In the simplest 1D\ntopological SC model, the oscillations of the conductance peak spacings (OCPSs)\narising from the MBSs overlap from the two wire ends manifest an increasing\noscillation amplitude with increasing magnetic field (in agreement with\ntheories without Coulomb blockade and in disagreement with a recent\nexperimental observation). We develop a generalized finite temperature master\nequation theory including not only multiple subbands in the nanowire, but also\nthe possibility of ordinary Andreev bound states in the non-topological regime.\nInclusion of all four effects (temperature, multiple subbands, Andreev bound\nstates, and MBSs) provides a complete picture of the tunneling transport\nproperties. Based on this complete theory, we indeed obtain OCPSs whose\namplitudes decrease with increasing magnetic field in qualitative agreement\nwith recent experimental results, but this happens only for rather high\ntemperatures with multisubband occupancy and the presence of both Andreev bound\nstates and MBSs.\n", "  We study cosmological perturbations in mimetic matter scenario with a general\nhigher derivative function. We calculate the quadratic action and show that\nboth the kinetic term and the gradient term have the wrong sings. We perform\nthe analysis in both comoving and Newtonian gauges and confirm that the\nHamiltonians and the associated instabilities are consistent with each other in\nboth gauges. The existence of instabilities is independent of the specific form\nof higher derivative function which generates gradients for mimetic field\nperturbations. It is verified that the ghost instability in mimetic\nperturbations is not associated with the higher derivative instabilities such\nas the Ostrogradsky ghost.\n", "  This Letter demonstrates control over multiphoton absorption processes in\ndriven two-level systems, which include for example superconducting qubits or\nlaser-irradiated graphene, through spectral shaping of the driving pulse.\nStarting from calculations based on Floquet theory, we use differential\nevolution, a general purpose optimization algorithm, to find the Fourier\ncoefficients of the driving function that suppress a given multiphoton\nresonance in the strong field-regime. We show that the suppression of the\ntransition probability is due to the coherent superposition of high-order\nFourier harmonics which closes the dynamical gap between the Floquet states of\nthe two-level system.\n", "  In this work, we study the late-time cosmological solutions of\nf(R,T)=g(R)+h(-T) models assuming that the conservation of the energy-momentum\ntensor (EMT) is violated. We perform our analysis through constructing an\nautonomous dynamical system for the equations of motion. We study the stability\nproperties of solutions via considering linear perturbations about the related\nequilibrium points. These parameters which are constructed out of the functions\ng(R) and h(-T) play the main role in finding the late time behavior of the\nsolutions.\n", "  Quantum control of the pathway along which a Rydberg electron field ionizes\nis experimentally and computationally demonstrated. Selective field ionization\nis typically done with a slowly rising electric field pulse. The $(1/n^*)^4$\nscaling of the classical ionization threshold leads to a rough mapping between\narrival time of the electron signal and principal quantum number of the Rydberg\nelectron. This is complicated by the many avoided level crossings that the\nelectron must traverse on the way to ionization, which in general leads to\nbroadening of the time-resolved field ionization signal. In order to control\nthe ionization pathway, thus directing the signal to the desired arrival time,\na perturbing electric field produced by an arbitrary waveform generator is\nadded to a slowly rising electric field. A genetic algorithm evolves the\nperturbing field in an effort to achieve the target time-resolved field\nionization signal.\n", "  In this work we demonstrate a simple way to implement the quantum inverse\nscattering method to find eigenstates of spin-1/2 XXX Gaudin magnets in an\narbitrarily oriented magnetic field. The procedure differs vastly from the most\nnatural approach which would be to simply orient the spin quantisation axis in\nthe same direction as the magnetic field through an appropriate rotation.\nInstead, we define a modified realisation of the rational Gaudin algebra and\nuse the quantum inverse scattering method which allows us, within a slightly\nmodified implementation, to build an algebraic Bethe ansatz using the same\nunrotated reference state (pseudovacuum) for any external field. This common\nframework allows us to easily write determinant expressions for certain scalar\nproducts which would be highly non-trivial in the rotated system approach.\n", "  The current understanding of pinned Brownian bridges is based on the\nOnsager-Machlup (OM) functional. The continuous-time limit of the OM functional\ncan be expressed either by using the Fokker-Planck equation or by using the\nRadon-Nikodym derivative with the help of the Girsanov theorem and Ito's lemma.\nThe resulting expression, called here, the Ito-Girsanov (IG) measure, has been\nused as a basis of algorithms designed to create ensembles of transition paths,\npaths that are constrained to start in one free energy basin and end in\nanother. Here we explore the underlying formalism and show that the IG measure\noriginates in an expression that is only conditionally convergent. Thus without\na sound mathematical foundation, the IG measure produces unphysical results\nwhen used in computer algorithms that are designed to elucidate chemical\ntransitions.\n", "  We study thermal and electrical transport in metals and superconductors near\na quantum phase transition where antiferromagnetic order disappears. The same\ntheory can also be applied to quantum phase transitions involving the loss of\ncertain classes of intrinsic topological order. For a clean superconductor, we\nrecover and extend the well-known universal results. The heat conductivity for\ncommensurate and incommensurate antiferromagnetism coexisting with\nsuperconductivity shows a markedly different doping dependence near the quantum\ncritical point, thus allowing to distinguish the states. In the dirty limit,\nthe results for the conductivities are qualitatively similar for the metal and\nthe superconductor. In this regime, the geometric properties of the Fermi\nsurface allow for a very good phenomenological understanding of the numerical\nresults on the conductivities. In the simplest model, we find that the\nconductivities do not track the doping evolution of the Hall coefficient, in\ncontrast to recent experimental findings. We propose a doping dependent\nscattering rate, possibly due to quenched short-range charge fluctuations below\noptimal doping, to consistently describe both the Hall data and the\nlongitudinal conductivities.\n", "  The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-ray Observatory is an\nextensive air shower detector operating in central Mexico, which has recently\ncompleted its first two years of full operations. If for a burst like GRB\n130427A at a redshift of 0.34 and a high-energy component following a power law\nwith index -1.66, the high-energy component is extended to higher energies with\nno cut-off other than from extragalactic background light attenuation, HAWC\nwould observe gamma rays with a peak energy of $\\sim$300 GeV. This paper\nreports the results of HAWC observations of 64 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected\nby $\\mathit{Swift}$ and $\\mathit{Fermi}$, including three GRBs that were also\ndetected by the Large Area Telescope ($\\mathit{Fermi}$-LAT). An ON/OFF analysis\nmethod is employed, searching on the time scale given by the observed light\ncurve at keV-MeV energies and also on extended time scales. For all GRBs and\ntime scales, no statistically significant excess of counts is found and upper\nlimits on the number of gamma rays and the gamma-ray flux are calculated. GRB\n170206A, the third brightest short GRB detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor\non board the $\\mathit{Fermi}$ satellite ($\\mathit{Fermi}$-GBM) and also\ndetected by the LAT, occurred very close to zenith. The LAT measurements can\nneither exclude the presence of a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) component nor\nconstrain its spectrum. Instead, the HAWC upper limits constrain the expected\ncut-off in an additional high-energy component to be less than $100~\\rm{GeV}$\nfor reasonable assumptions about the energetics and redshift of the burst.\n", "  The nanodomain pattern in ferroelectric/dielectric superlattices transforms\nto a uniform polarization state under above-bandgap optical excitation. X-ray\nscattering reveals a disappearance of domain diffuse scattering and an\nexpansion of the lattice. The reappearance of the domain pattern occurs over a\nperiod of seconds at room temperature, suggesting a transformation mechanism in\nwhich charge carriers in long-lived trap states screen the depolarization\nfield. A Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire model predicts changes in lattice parameter\nand a critical carrier concentration for the transformation.\n", "  Based on the two-particle irreducible (2PI) formalism to next-to-leading\norder in the $1/N$ expansion, we study the thermalization of overpopulated\nsystems in scalar $O(N)$ theories with moderate coupling. We focus in\nparticular on the growth of soft modes, and examine whether this can lead to\nthe formation of a transient Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) when the initial\noccupancy is high enough. For the value of the coupling constant used in our\nsimulations, we find that while the system rapidly approaches the condensation\nthreshold, the formation of a BEC is eventually hindered by particle number\nchanging processes.\n", "  We construct two possible candidates for the non-relativistic\n$\\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra in 4 space-time dimensions by contracting the\noriginal relativistic $\\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra. The $\\mathfrak{bms}_4$\nalgebra is infinite-dimensional, and it contains the generators of the\nPoincar\\'e algebra, together with the so-called super-translations. Similarly,\nthe proposed $\\mathfrak{nrbms}_4$ algebras can be regarded as two\ninfinite-dimensional extensions of the Bargmann algebra. We also study a\ncanonical realisation of one these algebras in terms of the Fourier modes of a\nfree Schr\\\"odinger field, mimicking the canonical realisation of the\nrelativistic $\\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra using a free Klein-Gordon field.\n", "  We apply the higher order tensor renormalization group to two and three\ndimensional relativistic fermion systems on the lattice. In order to perform a\ncoarse-graining of tensor networks including Grassmann variables, we introduce\nGrassmann higher order tensor renormalization group. We test the validity of\nthe new algorithm by comparing its results with those of exact or previous\nmethods.\n", "  Using HST, we identify circumnuclear ($100$-$500$ pc scale) structures in\nnine new H$_2$O megamaser host galaxies to understand the flow of matter from\nkpc-scale galactic structures down to the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at\ngalactic centers. We double the sample analyzed in a similar way by Greene et\nal. (2013) and consider the properties of the combined sample of 18 sources. We\nfind that disk-like structure is virtually ubiquitous when we can resolve\n$<200$ pc scales, in support of the notion that non-axisymmetries on these\nscales are a necessary condition for SMBH fueling. We perform an analysis of\nthe orientation of our identified nuclear regions and compare it with the\norientation of megamaser disks and the kpc-scale disks of the hosts. We find\nmarginal evidence that the disk-like nuclear structures show increasing\nmisalignment from the kpc-scale host galaxy disk as the scale of the structure\ndecreases. In turn, we find that the orientation of both the $\\sim100$ pc scale\nnuclear structures and their host galaxy large-scale disks is consistent with\nrandom with respect to the orientation of their respective megamaser disks.\n", "  Herein, we report the magneto-transport and exchange bias effect in a \"314 -\ntype\" oxygen - vacancy ordered material with composition\nSrCo$_{0.85}$Fe$_{0.15}$O$_{2.62}$. This material exhibits a ferrimagnetic\ntransition above room temperature, at 315 K. The negative magnetoresistance\nstarts to appear from room temperature (-1.3 $\\%$ at 295 K in 70 kOe) and\nreaches a sizable value of 58 $\\%$ at 4 K in 70 kOe. Large exchange bias effect\nis observed below 315 K when the sample is cooled in the presence of a magnetic\nfield. The coexistence of nearly compensated and ferrimagnetic regions in the\nlayered structure originate magnetoresistance and exchange bias in this sample.\nThe appearance of a sizable magnetoresistance and giant exchange bias effect,\nespecially near room temperature indicates that \"314-type\" cobaltates are a\npromising class of material systems for the exploration of materials with\npotential applications as magnetic sensors or in the area of spintronics.\n", "  Recent observations suggest that intensive molecular cloud collision can\ntrigger massive star/cluster formation. The most important physical process\ncaused by the collision is a shock compression. In this paper, the influence of\na shock wave on the evolution of a molecular cloud is studied numerically by\nusing isothermal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations with the effect of\nself-gravity. Adaptive-mesh-refinement and sink particle techniques are used to\nfollow long-time evolution of the shocked cloud. We find that the shock\ncompression of turbulent inhomogeneous molecular cloud creates massive\nfilaments, which lie perpendicularly to the background magnetic field as we\nhave pointed out in a previous paper. The massive filament shows global\ncollapse along the filament, which feeds a sink particle located at the\ncollapse center. We observe high accretion rate dot{M}_acc > 10^{-4} M_sun/yr\nthat is high enough to allow the formation of even O-type stars. The most\nmassive sink particle achieves M>50 M_sun in a few times 10^5 yr after the\nonset of the filament collapse.\n", "  We present an all optical technique to prepare a sample of $^{39}$K in a\nmagnetically-insensitive state with 95\\% purity while maintaining a temperature\nof 6 $\\mu$K. This versatile preparation scheme is particularly well suited to\nperforming matter-wave interferometry with species exhibiting closely-separated\nhyperfine levels, such as the isotopes of lithium and potassium, and opens new\npossibilities for metrology with these atoms. We demonstrate the feasibility of\nsuch measurements by realizing an atomic gravimeter and a Ramsey-type\nspectrometer, both of which exhibit a state-of-the-art sensitivity for cold\npotassium.\n", "  Dynamics of active deformable particles in an external Poiseuille flow is\ninvestigated. In order to make the analysis general, we employ time-evolution\nequations derived from symmetry considerations that take into account an\nelliptical shape deformation. First, we clarify the relation of our model to\nthat of rigid active particles. Then, we study the dynamical modes that active\ndeformable particles exhibit by changing the strength of the external flow. We\nemphasize the difference between the active particles that tend to self-propel\nparallel to the elliptical shape deformation and those self-propelling\nperpendicularly. In particular, a swinging motion around the centerline far\nfrom the channel walls is discussed in detail.\n", "  We report observations of an eruptive X2.8 flare on 2013 May 13, which shows\ntwo distinct episodes of energy release in the impulsive phase. The first\nepisode is characterized by the eruption of a magnetic flux rope, similar to\nthe energy-release process in most standard eruptive flares. While the second\nepisode, which is stronger than the first normal one and shows enhanced\nhigh-energy X-ray and even $\\gamma$-ray emissions, is closely associated with\nmagnetic reconnection of a large-scale loop in the aftermath of the eruption.\nThe reconnection inflow of the loop leg is observed in the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 304 \\r{A} passband and\naccelerates towards the reconnection region to a speed as high as $\\sim$130\nkm/s. Simultaneously the corresponding outflow jets are observed in the AIA hot\npassbands with a speed of $\\sim$740 km/s and mean temperature of $\\sim$14 MK.\nRHESSI observations show a strong burst of hard X-ray (HXR) and $\\gamma$-ray\nemissions with hard electron spectra of $\\delta\\approx3$, exhibiting a\nsoft-hard-harder behavior. A distinct altitude decrease of the HXR loop-top\nsource coincides with the inward swing of the loop leg observed in the AIA 304\n\\r{A} passband, which is suggested to be related to the coronal implosion. This\nfast inflow of magnetic flux contained in the loop leg greatly enhances the\nreconnection rate and results in very efficient particle acceleration in the\nsecond-step reconnection, which also helps to achieve a second higher\ntemperature peak up to T $\\approx$ 30 MK.\n", "  Silicon single-photon detectors (SPDs) are the key devices for detecting\nsingle photons in the visible wavelength range. Here we present high detection\nefficiency silicon SPDs dedicated to the generation of multiphoton entanglement\nbased on the technique of high-frequency sine wave gating. The silicon\nsingle-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) components are acquired by disassembling\n6 commercial single-photon counting modules (SPCMs). Using the new quenching\nelectronics, the average detection efficiency of SPDs is increased from 68.6%\nto 73.1% at a wavelength of 785 nm. These sine wave gating SPDs are then\napplied in a four-photon entanglement experiment, and the four-fold coincidence\ncount rate is increased by 30% without degrading its visibility compared with\nthe original SPCMs.\n", "  The free energy of a static quark-antiquark pair is obtained in an\ninteracting dyon ensemble near the deconfinement temperature. Comparing the\nresults with the noninteracting case, we observe that the string tension\nbetween the quark-antiquark pair increases for the interacting ensemble. As a\nresult, the confinement temperature decreases.\n", "  The Pristine survey is a narrow-band, photometric survey focused around the\nwavelength region of the Ca II H & K absorption lines, designed to efficiently\nsearch for extremely metal-poor stars. In this work, we use the first results\nof a medium-resolution spectroscopic follow-up to refine the selection criteria\nfor finding extremely metal-poor stars ($\\textrm{[Fe/H]} \\leq -3.0$) in the\nPristine survey. We consider methods by which stars can be selected from\navailable broad-band and infrared photometry plus the additional Pristine\nnarrow-band photometry. The spectroscopic sample presented in this paper\nconsists of 205 stars in the magnitude range $14 < V < 18$. Applying the\nphotometric selection criteria cuts the sample down to 149 stars, and from\nthese we report a success rate of 70% for finding stars with $\\textrm{[Fe/H]}\n\\leq -2.5$ and 22% for finding stars with $\\textrm{[Fe/H]} \\leq -3.0$. These\nstatistics compare favourably with other surveys that search for extremely\nmetal-poor stars, namely an improvement by a factor of $\\sim 4-5$ for\nrecovering stars with $\\textrm{[Fe/H]} \\leq -3.0$. In addition, Pristine covers\na fainter magnitude range than its predecessors, and can thus probe deeper into\nthe Galactic halo.\n", "  The total area of silicon in cell phone camera sensors worldwide surpasses\nthat in any experiment to date. Based on semiconductor technology similar to\nthat found in modern astronomical telescopes and particle detectors, these\nsensors can detect ionizing radiation in addition to photons. The Distributed\nElectronic Cosmic-ray Observatory (DECO) uses the global network of active cell\nphones in order to detect cosmic rays and other energetic particles such as\nthose produced by radioactive decays. DECO consists of an Android application,\ndatabase, and public data browser available to citizen scientists around the\nworld (https://wipac.wisc.edu/deco). Candidate cosmic-ray events have been\ndetected on all seven continents and can be categorized by the morphology of\ntheir corresponding images. We present the DECO project, a novel particle\ndetector with wide applications in public outreach and education.\n", "  The behaviour of sports balls during impact defines some special features of\neach sport. The velocity of the game, the accuracy of passes or shots, the\ncontrol of the ball direction after impact, the risks of injury, are all set by\nthe impact mechanics of the ball. For inflated sports balls, those\ncharacteristics are finely tuned by the ball inner pressure. As a consequence,\ninflation pressures are regulated for sports played with inflated balls.\nDespite a good understanding of ball elasticity, the source of energy\ndissipation for inflated balls remains controversial. We first give a clear\nview of non-dissipative impact mechanics. Second we review, analyse and\nestimate the different sources of energy dissipation of the multi-physics\nphenomena that occur during the impact. Finally, we propose several experiments\nto decide between gas compression, shell visco-elastic dissipation, solid\nfriction, sound emission or shell vibrations as the major source of energy\ndissipation.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the performance of different approximate\nvariants of the EOM-CCSD method for calculation of ionization potential, as\ncompared to EOM-CCSDT reference values. The errors in the various approximate\nvariants of the EOM-CCSD method are quite different for different kind of\nionized states. None of the approximate variants including the original\nEOM-CCSD method gives a uniform performance over outer valence, inner valence,\nand core ionization, favoring one or other, depending upon nature of the\napproximation used.\n", "  The coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos off nuclei has eluded detection\nfor four decades, even though its predicted cross-section is the largest by far\nof all low-energy neutrino couplings. This mode of interaction provides new\nopportunities to study neutrino properties, and leads to a miniaturization of\ndetector size, with potential technological applications. We observe this\nprocess at a 6.7-sigma confidence level, using a low-background, 14.6-kg\nCsI[Na] scintillator exposed to the neutrino emissions from the Spallation\nNeutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Characteristic\nsignatures in energy and time, predicted by the Standard Model for this\nprocess, are observed in high signal-to-background conditions. Improved\nconstraints on non-standard neutrino interactions with quarks are derived from\nthis initial dataset.\n", "  The well-known fact following from the Holmgren-John-Tataru uniqueness\ntheorem is a local approximate boundary $L_2$-controllability of the dynamical\nsystem governed by the wave equation. Generalizing this result, we establish\nthe controllability in certain classes of differentiable functions in the\ndomains filled up with waves.\n", "  The dynamics of photo-excited charge carriers, particularly their transport\nand interactions with defects and interfaces, play an essential role in\ndetermining the performance of a wide range of solar and optoelectronic\ndevices. A thorough understanding of these processes requires tracking the\nmotion of photocarriers in both space and time simultaneously with extremely\nhigh resolutions, which poses a significant challenge for previously developed\ntechniques, mostly based on ultrafast optical spectroscopy. Scanning ultrafast\nelectron microscopy (SUEM) is a recently developed photon-pump-electron-probe\ntechnique that combines the spatial resolution of scanning electron microscopes\n(SEM) and the temporal resolution of femtosecond ultrafast lasers. Despite many\nrecent excellent reviews for the ultrafast electron microscopy, we dedicate\nthis article specifically to SUEM, where we review the working principle and\ncontrast mechanisms of SUEM in the secondary-electron-detection mode from a\nusers' perspective and discuss the applications of SUEM to directly image\nphotocarrier dynamics in various materials. Furthermore, we propose future\ntheoretical and experimental directions for better understanding and fully\nutilizing the SUEM measurements to obtain detailed information about the\ndynamics of photocarriers. To conclude, we envision the potential of expanding\nSUEM into a versatile platform for probing photophysical processes beyond\nphotocarrier dynamics.\n", "  Rovibrational states of the four dimers formed by the light and the heavy\nisotopologues of the methane and the water molecules are computed using a\npotential energy surface taken from the literature. The general rovibrational\nenergy-level pattern characteristic to all systems studied is analyzed\nemploying two models of a dimer: the rigidly rotating complex and the coupled\nsystem of two rigidly rotating monomers. The rigid-rotor model highlights the\npresence of rovibrational sequences corresponding to formally negative\nrotational excitation energies, which is explained in terms of the\ncoupled-rotors picture.\n", "  We compare a global high resolution resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\nsimulation of Earth's magnetosphere with observations from the Magnetospheric\nMultiscale (MMS) constellation for a southward IMF magnetopause crossing during\nOctober 16, 2015 that was previously identified as an electron diffusion region\n(EDR) event. The simulation predicts a complex time-dependent magnetic topology\nconsisting of multiple separators and flux ropes. Despite the topological\ncomplexity, the predicted distance between MMS and the primary separator is\nless than 0.5 Earth radii. These results suggest that global magnetic topology,\nrather than local magnetic geometry alone, determines the location of the\nelectron diffusion region at the dayside magnetopause.\n", "  We consider a model of neutron-nuclear wave burning. The wave of nuclear\nburning of the medium is initiated by an external neutron source and is the\nbasis for the new generation reactors -- the so-called \"traveling-wave\nreactors\". We develop a model of nuclear wave burning, for which it is possible\nto draw an analogy with a mechanical dissipative system. Within the framework\nof the new model, we show that two burning modes are possible depending on the\ncontrol parameters: a traveling autowave and a wave driven by an external\nneutron source. We find the autowave to be possible for certain neutron\nenergies only, and the wave velocity has a continuous spectrum bounded below.\n", "  Unless we change direction, we are likely to wind up where we are headed.\n(Ancient Chinese proverb)\n", "  We have found many Earth-sized worlds but we have no way of determining if\ntheir surfaces are Earth-like. This makes it impossible to quantitatively\ncompare habitability, and pretending we can risks damaging the field.\n", "  Knowledge of the ancient geology and tectonics of the Earth owes much to\npaleo-magnetism. However, it is thought that paleo-magnetism has the\nincapability in providing paleo-longitude. To obtain this important location\nparameter many other indirect methods have been developed based on different\nassumptions. Here we present a direct method to derive the paleo-longitude from\nthe usual paleo-magnetic measurements. This method takes into account the\ncontributions to the Earth's magnetic potential from additional dipoles with\ntheir axes in the equatorial plane, which were omitted by the traditional\npaleo-magnetism. Two explicit formulae for inferring the longitude are\nobtained. It is shown in synthetic experiments that longitudes can be perfectly\nderived through these formulae, from the measured components of magnetic field\n($B_x, B_y, B_z$), or declination ($D$) and inclination($I$). The errors are\nmainly from $B_x,B_z$ or $I$. Thus these two explicit formulae can be used in\npaleo-magnetism as an alternative approach to estimate the paleo-longitude. By\nthis direct approach, we infer the synthetic paleo-longitudes for the reference\npoints in the continents of North America, Eurasia, and India for the last 200\nMa and a reference paleo-longitude for Indo-Asia collision based on\npaleo-magnetic data. The synthetic trajectories of these reference points,\nwhich determined by synthetic paleo-longitudes and paleo-latitudes, show the\nmovements of these three continents had their own respective properties. All of\nthem included different both translation and rotation in four phases. The\npaleo-longitude for India-Asia collision was at ${132.6^{-27.2}_{+14.7}}^\\circ\n$E.\n", "  We study the effect of Stacking Fault Energy (SFE) on the deformation\nbehaviour of copper and copper-aluminium alloys using Molecular Dynamics (MD)\nsimulation. We find that both yield stress and the magnitude of stress drop at\nyield decrease with increasing Al content. This \"anomalous\" softening behaviour\nis explained on the basis of nucleation controlled yielding behaviour. Further,\nthe decrease in stress drop is rationalised in terms of the stored energy\navailable at yielding - we show that this decreases with increasing Al. As a\nresult, the maximum dislocation density is found to decrease with increasing Al\ncontent. Finally, we show that the yield stress calculated using a continuum\nmodel of homogeneous nucleation of partial loops agrees well with the yield\nstress seen in the simulations.\n", "  Contributions of the Fluorescence detector Array of Single-pixel Telescopes\n(FAST) to the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference, 12-20 July 2017, Busan,\nKorea\n", "  Negative capacitance (NC) in ferroelectrics, which stems from the imperfect\nscreening of polarization, is considered a viable approach to lower voltage\noperation in the field-effect transistors (FETs) used in logic switches. In\nthis paper, we discuss the implications of the transient nature of negative\ncapacitance for its practical application. It is suggested that the NC effect\nneeds to be characterized at the proper time scale to identify the type of\ncircuits where functional NC-FETs can be used effectively.\n", "  In 2004 Denmark introduced a compulsory integrated science course the most\npopular upper secondary study program. One of the nation-wide course aims are\nfor students to \"achieve knowledge about some of the central scientific issues\nand their social, ethical, and historical perspectives\". This is to be done via\ncollaboration between the subjects, and often involves physics and another\nscientific subject. The official teaching plans further state that mathematics\nmust be used for analysing data. We use network analysis to study six different\nimplementations of the course in terms of the structure of different kinds of\nteaching/learning activities. By creating networks maps of each lesson, we show\nthat teaching/learning activities in the course seldom tends to address how\nsciences can work together to solve a problem, but rather stages each natural\nscience as a distinct and separate activity with a distinct identity.\n", "  The search for axions has gained ground in recent years, with laboratory\nsearches for cold dark matter (CDM) axions, relativistic solar axions and\nultra-light axions the subject of extensive literature. In particular, the\ninterest in axions as a CDM candidate has been motivated by its potential to\naccount for all of the inferred value of $\\Omega_{DM} \\sim 0.26$ in the\nstandard $\\Lambda CDM$ model. Indeed, the value of $\\Omega_{DM} \\sim 0.26$\ncould be provided by a light axion. We investigate the possibility of\ncomplementing existing axion search experiments with radio telescope\nobservations in an attempt to detect axion conversion in astrophysical magnetic\nfields. Searching for a CDM axion signal from a large-scale astrophysical\nenvironment provides new challenges, with the magnetic field structure playing\na crucial role in both the rate of interaction and the properties of the\nobserved photon. However, with a predicted frequency in the radio band (200MHz\n- 200GHz) and a distinguishable spectral profile, next generation radio\ntelescopes may offer new opportunities for detection. The SKA-mid telescope has\na planned frequency range of 0.4 - 13.8GHz with optimal sensitivity in the\nrange $\\sim$ 2 - 7 GHz. Considering observations at $\\sim 500$MHz, the limiting\nsensitivity is expected to be $\\sim 0.04$mK based on a 24 hour integration\ntime. This compares with a predicted CDM axion all-sky signal temperature of\n$\\sim 0.04$mK using SKA Phase 1 telescopes and up to $\\sim 1.17$mK using a\ncollecting area of (1km)$^2$ as planned for Phase 2.\n", "  Transient effects at excitation of high-Q resonant modes at a leading front\nof a laser pulse and their decomposition at its trailing edge during the pulse\nscattering by a particle are discussed. The main attention is paid to the\nnonradiating (anapole) mode excited in a high-index cylinder. The problem is\nstudied both analytically and numerically. It is shown that the anapole is a\nsteady but essentially nonequilibrium mode, which can exist if and only if the\nhost particle is irradiated by a continuous incident wave. As soon as the\nincident wave is switched off the anapole becomes a radiating mode and\ncollapses very fast owing to extensive radiative losses. It ruins the hopes to\nemploy the anapole-like excitations as storages for the \"frozen light.\"\n", "  We summarize the outcome of the 12th meeting of the International\nAstronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration (IACHEC), held at the UCLA\nconference center in Lake Arrowhead (California) in March 2017. 56 scientists\ndirectly involved in the calibration of operational and future high-energy\nmissions gathered during 3.5 days to discuss the status of the X-ray payload\ninter-calibration, as well as possible ways to improve it. The \"Thermal\nSupernovas Remnant\" (SNR) Working Group presented a recently published paper on\n1E0102.2-7219 as a calibration standard in the 0.5-1.0 keV band. A new method\nto measure the high-energy spectrum of the Crab Nebula and pulsar with NuSTAR\nwithout using its optics may yield a new absolute flux standard in the 3-7 keV\nband. A new ACIS contamination model - released with CALDB version 4.7.3 -\nleads to a significant improvement in modeling the spectral, spatial, and\ntemporal properties of the contaminant. The first calibration results of the\nscientific payload on board Hitomi confirm the excellent performance of the\ninstruments before the spacecraft operation problems leading to its loss.\nFinally, the meeting discussed extensively a novel statistic approach to\nformally identify in which direction the effective areas of different\ninstruments would need to be changed to bring them into concordance. This\nmethod could inform future further calibration efforts.\n", "  A novel formulation of second-order relativistic viscous fluid dynamics based\non the effective Boltzmann equation for quasi-particles with medium-dependent\nmasses is briefly reviewed.~The evolution equations for the shear and bulk\ndissipative corrections, and the corresponding transport coefficients, are\npresented. Resulting approach allows for thermodynamically-consistent\nincorporation of lattice QCD equation of state in the fluid dynamical\nframework.\n", "  Advanced telescopes, such as ALMA and JWST, are likely to show that the\nchemical universe may be even more complex than currently observed, requiring\nastrochemical modelers to improve their models to account for the impact of new\ndata. However, essential input information for gas-grain models, such as\nbinding energies of molecules to the surface, have been derived experimentally\nonly for a handful of species, leaving hundreds of species with highly\nuncertain estimates. We present in this paper a systematic study of the effect\nof uncertainties in the binding energies on an astrochemical two-phase model of\na dark molecular cloud, using the rate equations approach. A list of\nrecommended binding energy values based on a literature search of published\ndata is presented. Thousands of simulations of dark cloud models were run, and\nin each simulation a value for the binding energy of hundreds of species was\nrandomly chosen from a normal distribution. Our results show that the binding\nenergy of H$_{2}$ is critical for the surface chemistry. For high binding\nenergy, H$_{2}$ freezes out on the grain forming an H$_{2}$ ice. This is not\nphysically realistic and we suggest a change in the rate equations. The\nabundance ranges found are in reasonable agreement with astronomical ice\nobservations. Pearson correlation coefficients revealed that the binding energy\nof HCO, HNO, CH$_{2}$, and C correlate most strongly with the abundance of\ndominant ice species. Finally, the formation route of complex organic molecules\nwas found to be sensitive to the branching ratios of H$_{2}$CO hydrogenation.\n", "  In this article we present very intuitive, easy to follow, yet mathematically\nrigorous, approach to the so called data fitting process. Rather than\nminimizing the distance between measured and simulated data points, we prefer\nto find such an area in searched parameters' space that generates simulated\ncurve crossing as many acquired experimental points as possible, but at least\nhalf of them. Such a task is pretty easy to attack with interval calculations.\nThe problem is, however, that interval calculations operate on guaranteed\nintervals, that is on pairs of numbers determining minimal and maximal values\nof measured quantity while in vast majority of cases our measured quantities\nare expressed rather as a pair of two other numbers: the average value and its\nstandard deviation. Here we propose the combination of interval calculus with\nbasic notions from probability and statistics. This approach makes possible to\nobtain the results in familiar form as reliable values of searched parameters,\ntheir standard deviations, and their correlations as well. There are no\nassumptions concerning the probability density distributions of experimental\nvalues besides the obvious one that their variances are finite. Neither the\nsymmetry of uncertainties of experimental distributions is required (assumed)\nnor those uncertainties have to be `small.' As a side effect, outliers are\nquietly and safely ignored, even if numerous.\n", "  Many physically important mechanical systems may be described with a Lie\ngroup $G$ as configuration space. According to the well-known Noether's\ntheorem, underlying symmetries of the Lie group may be used to considerably\nreduce the complexity of the problems. However, these reduction techniques,\nused without care for general problems (waves, field theory), may lead to\nuncomfortable infinite dimensional spaces. As an alternative, the\n\\emph{covariant} formulation allows to consider a finite dimensional\nconfiguration space by increasing the number of independent variables. But the\ngeometric elements needed for reduction, adapted to the specificity of\ncovariant problems which admit Lie groups as configuration space, are difficult\nto apprehend in the literature (some are even missing to our knowledge). To\nfill this gap, this article reconsiders the historical geometric construction\nmade by E. Cartan in this particular \"covariant Lie group\" context. Thus, and\nit is the main interest of this work, the Poincar\\'e-Cartan and\nmulti-symplectic forms are obtained for a principal $G$ bundle. It allows to\nformulate the \\emph{Euler-Poincar\\'e equations} of motion and leads to a\nNoether's current form defined in the dual Lie algebra.\n", "  Extragalactic relativistic jets are composed by charged particles and\nmagnetic fields, as inferred from the synchrotron emission that we receive from\nthem. The Larmor radii of the particles propagating along the magnetic field\nare much smaller than the scales of the problem, providing the necessary\ncoherence to the system to treat is as a flow. We can thus study them using\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamics. As a first step, we have studied the\nstructure of steady-state configurations of jets by using numerical\nsimulations. We have used a helical field configuration and have changed\ndifferent relevant parameters that control the way in which the energy flux is\ndistributed in jets (namely, the proportion of the energy flux carried by\ninternal, kinetic or magnetic energy). Our results show significant differences\namong the different kinds of jets. Finally, we also report on results based on\nsynthetic maps of our simulated jets.\n", "  Understanding lithium solvation and transport in ionic liquids is important\ndue to their possible application in electrochemical devices. Using\nfirst-principles simulations aided by a metadynamics approach we study the\nfree-energy landscape for lithium ions at infinite dilution in ethylammonium\nnitrate, a protic ionic liquid. We analyze the local structure of the liquid\naround the lithium cation and obtain a quantitative picture in agreement with\nexperimental findings. Our simulations show that the lowest two free energy\nminima correspond to conformations with the lithium ion being solvated either\nby three or four nitrate ions with a transition barrier between them of 0.2\n\\eV. Other less probable conformations having different solvation pattern are\nalso investigated.\n", "  Incomplete stacking dislocations are predicted to form at edges of the\nshorter upper layer in two-dimensional hexagonal bilayers upon stretching the\nlonger bottom layer. A concept of the edge Burgers vector is introduced to\ndescribe such dislocations by analogy with the Burgers vector of standard bulk\ndislocations. Analytical solutions for the structure and energy of edge\nstacking dislocations in bilayer graphene are obtained depending on the\nmagnitude of elongation and angles between the edge Burgers vector, direction\nof elongation and edge. The barrier for penetration of stacking dislocations\ninside the bilayer is estimated. The possibilities to measure the barrier to\nrelative motion of graphene layers and strain of graphene on a substrate by\nobservation of edge stacking dislocations are discussed.\n", "  We consider spin systems with nearest-neighbor interactions on an $n$-vertex\n$d$-dimensional cube of the integer lattice graph $\\mathbb{Z}^d$. We study the\neffects that exponential decay with distance of spin correlations, specifically\nthe strong spatial mixing condition (SSM), has on the rate of convergence to\nequilibrium distribution of non-local Markov chains. We prove that SSM implies\n$O(\\log n)$ mixing of a block dynamics whose steps can be implemented\nefficiently. We then develop a methodology, consisting of several new\ncomparison inequalities concerning various block dynamics, that allow us to\nextend this result to other non-local dynamics. As a first application of our\nmethod we prove that, if SSM holds, then the relaxation time (i.e., the inverse\nspectral gap) of general block dynamics is $O(r)$, where $r$ is the number of\nblocks. A second application of our technology concerns the Swendsen-Wang\ndynamics for the ferromagnetic Ising and Potts models. We show that SSM implies\nan $O(1)$ bound for the relaxation time. As a by-product of this implication we\nobserve that the relaxation time of the Swendsen-Wang dynamics in square boxes\nof $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is $O(1)$ throughout the subcritical regime of the $q$-state\nPotts model, for all $q \\ge 2$. We also prove that for monotone spin systems\nSSM implies that the mixing time of systematic scan dynamics is $O(\\log n (\\log\n\\log n)^2)$. Systematic scan dynamics are widely employed in practice but have\nproved hard to analyze. Our proofs use a variety of techniques for the analysis\nof Markov chains including coupling, functional analysis and linear algebra.\n", "  Suspended fibres significantly alter fluid rheology, as exhibited in for\nexample solutions of DNA, RNA and synthetic biological nanofibres. It is of\ninterest to determine how this altered rheology affects flow stability.\nMotivated by the fact thermal gradients may occur in biomolecular analytic\ndevices, and recent stability results, we examine the problem of\nRayleigh-B\\'enard convection of the transversely-isotropic fluid of Ericksen. A\ntransversely-isotropic fluid treats these suspensions as a continuum with an\nevolving preferred direction, through a modified stress tensor incorporating\nfour viscosity-like parameters. We consider the linear stability of a\nstationary, passive, transversely-isotropic fluid contained between two\nparallel boundaries, with the lower boundary at a higher temperature than the\nupper. To determine the marginal stability curves the Chebyshev collocation\nmethod is applied, and we consider a range of initially uniform preferred\ndirections, from horizontal to vertical, and three orders of magnitude in the\nviscosity-like anisotropic parameters. Determining the critical wave and\nRayleigh numbers we find that transversely-isotropic effects delay the onset of\ninstability; this effect is felt most strongly through the incorporation of the\nanisotropic shear viscosity, although the anisotropic extensional viscosity\nalso contributes. Our analysis confirms the importance of anisotropic rheology\nin the setting of convection.\n", "  Since 2010 IceCube observed around 50 high-energy neutrino events of cosmic\norigin above 60 TeV, but the astrophysical sources of these events are still\nunknown. We recently proposed high-energy emitting BL Lac (HBL) objects as\ncandidate emitters of high-energy neutrinos. Assuming a direct proportionality\nbetween high-energy gamma-ray and very-high energy neutrino fluxes, we\ncalculated the expected neutrino event number in a year for IceCube and the\npresently under construction Km3NeT. To give a value of the significance of a\ndetection we considered also the background for the single sources. To this aim\nwe derived the through-going muon rate, generated by muon neutrino including\nthe effect of Earth absorption, the density of the Earth and the cross section\n$\\nu N$. Applying this calculation both to HBL sources and the atmospherical\nneutrino background, we can calculate the expected significance of the\ndetection by IceCube, showing that our scenario is compatible with a no\ndetection of HBL.\n", "  In spite of the high potential of endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) for\napplication in biology, medicine and molecular electronics and recent efforts\nin EMF synthesis, the variety of EMFs accessible by conventional synthetic\nmethods remains limited and does not include, for example, EMFs of late\ntransition metals. We propose a method in which EMF formation is initiated by\nelectron irradiation in aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission\nelectron spectroscopy (AC-HRTEM) of a metal cluster surrounded by amorphous\ncarbon inside a carbon nanotube serving as a nano-reactor and apply this method\nfor synthesis of nickel EMFs. The use of ACHRTEM makes it possible not only to\nsynthesize new, previously unattainable nanoobjects but also to study in situ\nthe mechanism of structural transformations. Molecular dynamics simulations\nusing the state-of-the-art approach for modeling the effect of electron\nirradiation are performed to rationalise the experimental observations and to\nlink the observed processes with conditions of bulk EMF synthesis.\n", "  Low-energy neutron-${}^{19}$C scattering is studied in the three-body\n  $n + n + {}^{18}$C model using a realistic $nn$ potential and a number of\nshallow and deep $n$-${}^{18}$C potentials, the latter supporting deeply-bound\nPauli-forbidden states that are projected out. Exact Faddeev-type three-body\nscattering equations for transition operators including two- and three-body\nforces are solved in the momentum-space partial-wave framework. Phase shift,\ninelasticity parameter, and cross sections are calculated. For the elastic\n$n$-${}^{19}$C scattering in the $J^\\Pi=0^+$ partial wave the signatures of the\nEfimov physics, i.e., the pole in the effective-range expansion and the elastic\ncross section minimum, are confirmed for both shallow and deep models, but with\nclear quantitative differences between them, indicating the importance of a\nproper treatment of deeply-bound Pauli-forbidden states. In contrast, the\ninelasticity parameter is mostly correlated with the asymptotic normalization\ncoefficient of the ${}^{19}$C bound state. Finally, in the regime of very weak\n${}^{19}$C binding and near-threshold (bound or virtual) excited ${}^{20}$C\nstate the standard Efimovian behaviour of the $n$-${}^{19}$C scattering length\nand cross section was confirmed, resolving the discrepancies between earlier\nstudies by other authors [I. Mazumdar, A. R. P. Rau, V. S. Bhasin, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 97 (2006) 062503; M. T. Yamashita, T. Frederico, L. Tomio, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 99 (2007) 269201].\n", "  The pulsed radiation from PSR B0833-45 (Vela) has a phased-averaged spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) of an apparently simple structure across a wide\nenergy range, from optical light to hard gamma-rays. However, the Vela pulses\nin narrow energy bands reveal astonishing complexity of the directional pattern\nof the radiation. These pulses are, therefore, a unique clue to the underlying\nradiative processes. We present the results of a 3D modeling of the Vela\nradiation properties within an outer-gap scenario. We show how the inverse\nCompton scattering of photons by primary and secondary particles in its\nmagnetic and non-magnetic regimes reproduces qualitatively, and in some cases\nquantitatively, the observed energy-dependent pulses of Vela.\n", "  Transformation of amorphous carbon clusters into fullerenes under high\ntemperature is studied using molecular dynamics simulations at microsecond\ntimes. Based on the analysis of both structure and energy of the system, it is\nfound that fullerene formation occurs in two stages. Firstly, fast\ntransformation of the initial amorphous structure into a hollow sp$^2$ shell\nwith a few chains attached occurs with a considerable decrease of the potential\nenergy and the number of atoms belonging to chains and to the amorphous domain.\nThen, insertion of remaining carbon chains into the sp$^2$ network takes place\nat the same time with the fullerene shell formation. Two types of defects\nremaining after the formation of the fullerene shell are revealed: 7-membered\nrings and single one-coordinated atoms. One of the fullerene structures\nobtained contains no defects at all, which demonstrates that defect-free carbon\ncages can be occasionally formed from amorphous precursors directly without\ndefect healing. No structural changes are observed after the fullerene\nformation, suggesting that defect healing is a slow process in comparison with\nthe fullerene shell formation. The schemes of the revealed reactions of chain\natoms insertion into the fullerene shell just before its completion are\npresented. The results of the performed simulations are summarized within the\nparadigm of fullerene formation due to selforganization of the carbon system.\n", "  We use computer simulation to study the layer-by-layer growth of particle\nstructures in a lattice gas, taking the number of incorporated vacancies as a\nmeasure of the quality of the grown structure. By exploiting a dynamic scaling\nrelation between structure quality in and out of equilibrium, we determine that\nthe best quality of structure is obtained, for fixed observation time, with\nstrong interactions and far-from-equilibrium growth conditions. This result\ncontrasts with the usual assumption that weak interactions and mild\nnonequilibrium conditions are the best way to minimize errors during assembly.\n", "  We present a model of the dynamical transition of atomic displacements in\nproteins. Increased mean-square displacement at higher temperatures is caused\nby softening of the vibrational force constant by electrostatic and van der\nWaals forces from the protein-water thermal bath. Vibrational softening passes\nthrough a nonergodic dynamical transition when the relaxation time of the\nforce-force correlation function enters, with increasing temperature, the\ninstrumental observation window. Two crossover temperatures are identified. The\nlower crossover, presently connected to the glass transition, is related to the\ndynamical unfreezing of rotations of water molecules within nanodomains\npolarized by charged surface residues of the protein. The higher crossover\ntemperature, usually assigned to the dynamical transition, marks the onset of\nwater translations. All crossovers are ergodicity breaking transitions\ndepending on the corresponding observation windows. Allowing stretched\nexponential relaxation of the protein-water thermal bath significantly improves\nthe theory-experiment agreement when applied to solid protein samples studied\nby Moessbauer spectroscopy.\n", "  Scintillating, cryogenic bolometers are widely used in the field of rare\nevent searches. Their main advantages are an excellent energy resolution and\nparticle identification on an event-by-event basis. The sensitivity of\nexperiments applying this detector technique can be limited by the performance\nof the light channel and the presence of external backgrounds in the region of\ninterest. In the framework of the CRESST-II experiment, we developed and\nsuccessfully tested a novel detector design addressing both challenges. Using a\nlarge scale ($\\approx$\\unit[60]{cm$^2$}), beaker-shaped silicon light absorber,\nthe signal height recorded in the light channel is improved by a factor 2.5\ncompared to conventional CRESTT-II detector modules. In combination with a\nlarge carrier crystal, a true $4\\pi$ veto system is established which allows to\ntag external background sources.\n", "  We describe a new method for determining proper motions of extended objects,\nand a pipeline developed for the application of this method. We then apply this\nmethod to an analysis of four epochs of [S~II] HST images of the HH~1 jet\n(covering a period of $\\sim 20$~yr).\n  We determine the proper motions of the knots along the jet, and make a\nreconstruction of the past ejection velocity time-variability (assuming\nballistic knot motions). This reconstruction shows an \"acceleration\" of the\nejection velocities of the jet knots, with higher velocities at more recent\ntimes. This acceleration will result in an eventual merging of the knots in\n$\\sim 450$~yr and at a distance of $\\sim 80\"$ from the outflow source, close to\nthe present-day position of HH~1.\n", "  An innovative model is presented for merging of bubbles inside a liquid\nmetal. The proposed model is based on forming a thin film (narrow channel)\nbetween merging bubbles during growth. Rupturing of the film occurs when an\noscillation in velocity and pressure arises inside the channel followed by\nmerging of the bubbles. The proposed model based on lattice Boltzmann Method is\ncapable of simulating merging bubbles in micro, meso, and macro-scales with no\nlimitation on the number of bubbles. Experimental studies reveal a good\nconsistency between modeling results and real conditions.\n", "  We discuss several topics related to the notion of strong hyperbolicity which\nare of interest in general relativity. After introducing the concept and\nshowing its relevance we provide some covariant definitions of strong\nhyperbolicity. We then prove that is a system is strongly hyperbolic with\nrespect to a given hypersurface, then it is also strongly hyperbolic with\nrespect to any near by one.\n  We then study for how much these hypersurfaces can be deformed and discuss\nthen causality, namely what is the maximal propagation speed in any given\ndirection.\n  To show that the concept is needed in the area of general relativity we\ndiscuss two results for which the theory of symmetric hyperbolic systems shows\nto be insufficient. The first deals with the hyperbolicity analysis of systems\nwhich are second order in space derivatives, they include certain versions of\nthe ADM and the BSSN families of equations.\n  The second result deals with systems having constraints. The question posed\nis which hyperbolicity properties, if any, are inherited from the original\nevolution system by the subsidiary system satisfied by the constraint\nquantities. The answer is that, subject to some condition on the constraints,\nif the evolution system is strongly hyperbolic then the subsidiary system is\nalso strongly hyperbolic and the causality properties of both are identical.\n"]}
