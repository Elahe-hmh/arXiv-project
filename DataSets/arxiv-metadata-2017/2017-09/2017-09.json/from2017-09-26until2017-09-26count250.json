fields, relativistic point particles,\nand DBI branes. We examine two novel features that arise for DBI brane\ntunneling: the rate can sometimes increase as the barrier gets higher; and the\ninstanton \"wrinkles\". We show that these features can be understood as the\neffect of the quantum sea of virtual brane-antibrane pairs. This sea\nexponentially augments the decay rate, with possible cosmological consequences.\n", "  Two extreme members of the cobaltite series, LaCoO3 and DyCoO3, were\ninvestigated by the electrical resistivity and thermopower measurements up to\n800-1000 K. Special attention was given to effects of extra holes or electrons,\nintroduced by light doping of Co sites by Mg2+ or Ti4+ ions. The experiments on\nthe La based compounds were complemented with magnetic measurements. The study\nshows that both kinds of charge carriers induce magnetic states on surrounding\nCoIII sites and form thus thermally stable polarons of large total spin. Their\nitinerancy is characterized by low temperature resistivity, which is of\nArrhenius type r~exp(EA/kT) for the hole (CoIV) doped samples, while an unusual\ndependence r~1/Tn (n=8-10) is observed for the electron (CoII) doped samples.\nAt higher temperatures, additional hole carriers are massively populated in the\nCoIII background, leading to a resistivity drop. This transition become evident\nat ~300 K and 450 K and culminates at TI-M=540 and 780 K for the La and Dy\nbased samples, respectively.\n  The electronic behaviours of the cobaltites are explained considering two\nexcitation processes in parent compounds. The first one is related to a local\nexcitation from the diamagnetic LS CoIII to close-lying paramagnetic HS CoIII\nstate. Secondarily, a metallic phase of the IS CoIII character is formed\nthrough a charge transfer mechanism between LS/HS pairs. The magnetic polarons\nassociated with doped carriers are interpreted as droplets of such IS phase.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss some subtle concepts, such as coordinate,\nmeasurement, simultaneity, Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction, singularity in\nfundamental physics. The explanations of these concepts in textbooks are\nusually incomplete and lead to puzzles. Some long-standing paradoxes such as\nthe Ehrenfest one are caused by misinterpretation of these concepts. The\nanalysis shows these concepts all have simple and naive meanings, and can be\nwell understood using suitable logical procedure. The discussion may shed light\non some famous paradoxes, and provide some new insights into the structure and\nfeatures of a promising unified field theory.\n", "  A new Monte Carlo code for the simulation of the channeling of\nultrarelativistic charged projectiles in single crystals is presented. A\ndetailed description of the underlying physical model and the computation\nalgorithm is given. First results obtained with the code for the channeling of\n855 MeV electrons in Silicon crystal are presented. The dechanneling lengths\nfor (100), (110) and (111) crystallographic planes are estimated. In order to\nverify the code, the dependence of the intensity of the channeling radiation on\nthe crystal dimension along the beam direction is calculated. A good agreement\nof the obtained results with recent experimental data is observed.\n", "  Particle aspects of two-dimensional conformal field theories are\ninvestigated, using methods from algebraic quantum field theory. The results\ninclude asymptotic completeness in terms of (counterparts of) Wigner particles\nin any vacuum representation and the existence of (counterparts of)\ninfraparticles in any charged irreducible product representation of a given\nchiral conformal field theory. Moreover, an interesting interplay between the\ninfraparticle's direction of motion and the superselection structure is\ndemonstrated in a large class of examples. This phenomenon resembles the\nelectron's momentum superselection expected in quantum electrodynamics.\n", "  A convenient framework to treat massless two-dimensional scattering theories\nhas been established by Buchholz. In this framework, we show that the\nasymptotic algebra and the scattering matrix completely characterize the given\ntheory under asymptotic completeness and standard assumptions.\n  Then we obtain several families of interacting wedge-local nets by a purely\nvon Neumann algebraic procedure. One particular case of them coincides with the\ndeformation of chiral CFT by Buchholz-Lechner-Summers. In another case, we\nmanage to determine completely the strictly local elements. Finally, using\nLongo-Witten endomorphisms on the U(1)-current net and the free fermion net, a\nlarge family of wedge-local nets is constructed.\n", "  In the first part, we have constructed several families of interacting\nwedge-local nets of von Neumann algebras. In particular, there has been\ndiscovered a family of models based on the endomorphisms of the U(1)-current\nalgebra of Longo-Witten.\n  In this second part, we further investigate endomorphisms and interacting\nmodels. The key ingredient is the free massless fermionic net, which contains\nthe U(1)-current net as the fixed point subnet with respect to the U(1) gauge\naction. Through the restriction to the subnet, we construct a new family of\nLongo-Witten endomorphisms on the U(1)-current net and accordingly interacting\nwedge-local nets in two-dimensional spacetime. The U(1)-current net admits the\nstructure of particle numbers and the S-matrices of the models constructed here\ndo mix the spaces with different particle numbers of the bosonic Fock space.\n", "  Two recent deformation schemes for quantum field theories on the\ntwo-dimensional Minkowski space, making use of deformed field operators and\nLongo-Witten endomorphisms, respectively, are shown to be equivalent.\n", "  Facing the threats of infectious diseases, we take various actions to protect\nourselves, but few studies considered an evolving system with competing\nstrategies. In view of that, we propose an evolutionary epidemic model coupled\nwith human behaviors, where individuals have three strategies: vaccination,\nself-protection and laissez faire, and could adjust their strategies according\nto their neighbors' strategies and payoffs at the beginning of each new season\nof epidemic spreading. We found a counter-intuitive phenomenon analogous to the\nwell-known \\emph{Braess's Paradox}, namely a better condition may lead to worse\nperformance. Specifically speaking, increasing the successful rate of\nself-protection does not necessarily reduce the epidemic size or improve the\nsystem payoff. This phenomenon is insensitive to the network topologies, and\ncan be well explained by a mean-field approximation. Our study demonstrates an\nimportant fact that a better condition for individuals may yield a worse\noutcome for the society.\n", "  Crystal and magnetic structures of the $x=0.2$ member of La$_{\\rm\n0.8-x}$Tb$_{\\rm x}$Ca$_{0.2}$CoO$_3$ perovskite series have been determined\nfrom the powder neutron diffraction. Enhancement of the diffraction peaks due\nto ferromagnetic or cluster glass ordering is observed below $T_C=55$ K. The\nmoments evolve at first on Co sites, and ordering of Ising-type Tb$^{3+}$\nmoments is induced at lower temperatures by a molecular field due to Co ions.\nThe final magnetic configuration is collinear F$_x$ for cobalt subsystem, while\nit is canted F$_x$C$_y$ for terbium ions. The rare-earth moments align along\nlocal Ising axes within \\textit{ab}-plane of the orthorhombic $Pbnm$ structure.\nThe behavior in external fields up to $70-90$ kOe has been probed by the\nmagnetization and heat capacity measurements. The dilute terbium ions\ncontribute to significant coercivity and remanence that both steeply increase\nwith decreasing temperature. A remarkable manifestation of the Tb$^{3+}$ Ising\ncharacter is the observation of a low-temperature region of anomalously large\nlinear term of heat capacity and its field dependence. Similar behaviours are\ndetected also for other terbium dopings $x=0.1$ and 0.3.\n", "  A unifying description of lattice potentials generated by aperiodic\none-dimensional sequences is proposed in terms of their local reflection or\nparity symmetry properties. We demonstrate that the ranges and axes of local\nreflection symmetry possess characteristic distributional and dynamical\nproperties which can be determined for every aperiodic binary lattice. A\nstriking aspect of such a property is given by the return maps of sequential\nspacings of local symmetry axes, which typically traverse few-point symmetry\norbits. This local symmetry dynamics allows for a classification of inherently\ndifferent aperiodic lattices according to fundamental symmetry principles.\nIllustrating the local symmetry distributional and dynamical properties for\nseveral representative binary lattices, we further show that the renormalized\naxis spacing sequences follow precisely the particular type of underlying\naperiodic order. Our analysis thus reveals that the long-range order of\naperiodic lattices is characterized in a compellingly simple way by its local\nsymmetry dynamics.\n", "  The orthoperovskites TbCoO$_3$ and DyCoO$_3$ with Co$^{3+}$ in a non-magnetic\nlow-spin state have been investigated by neutron diffraction down to 0.25 K.\nMagnetic ordering is evidenced below $T_N=3.3$ K and 3.6 K, respectively, and\nthe ordered arrangements are of canted type, A$_x$G$_y$ for TbCoO$_3$ and\nG$_x$A$_y$ for DyCoO$_3$ in Bertaut's notation. The experiments are confronted\nwith the first-principle calculations of the crystal field and magnetism of\nTb$^{3+}$ and Dy$^{3+}$ ions, located in the $Pbnm$ structure on sites of $C_s$\npoint symmetry. Both these ions exhibit an Ising behavior, which originates in\nthe lowest energy levels, in particular in accidental doublet of non-Kramers\nTb$^{3+}$ ($4f^8$ configuration) and in ground Kramers doublet of Dy$^{3+}$\n($4f^9$) and it is the actual reason for the non-collinear AFM structures. Very\ngood agreement between the experiment and theory is found. For comparison,\ncalculations of the crystal field and magnetism for other systems with Kramers\nions, NdCoO$_3$ and SmCoO$_3$, are also included.\n", "  We explore the surprisingly rich energy landscape of origami-like folding\nplanar structures. We show that the configuration space of rigid-paneled\ndegree-4 vertices, the simplest building blocks of such systems, consists of at\nleast two distinct branches meeting at the flat state. This suggests that\ngeneric vertices are at least bistable, but we find that the nonlinear nature\nof these branches allows for vertices with as many as five distinct stable\nstates. In vertices with collinear folds and/or symmetry, more branches emerge\nleading to up to six stable states. Finally, we introduce a procedure to tile\narbitrary 4-vertices while preserving their stable states, thus allowing the\ndesign and creation of multistable origami metasheets.\n", "  We prove that the Grothendieck-Springer simultaneous resolution viewed as a\ncorrespondence between the adjoint quotient of a Lie algebra and its maximal\ntorus is Lagrangian in the sense of shifted symplectic structures. As\nHamiltonian spaces can be interpreted as Lagrangians in the adjoint quotient,\nthis allows one to reduce a Hamiltonian $G$-space to a Hamiltonian $H$-space\nwhere $H$ is the maximal torus of $G$. We show that this procedure coincides\nwith an algebraic version of symplectic implosion of Guillemin, Jeffrey and\nSjamaar. We explain how to obtain generalizations of this picture to\nquasi-Hamiltonian spaces and their elliptic version.\n", "  We study rigidity percolation transitions in two-dimensional central-force\nisostatic lattices, including the square and the kagome lattices, as\nnext-nearest-neighbor bonds (\"braces\") are randomly added to the system. In\nparticular, we focus on the differences between regular lattices, which are\nperfectly periodic, and generic lattices with the same topology of bonds but\nwhose sites are at random positions in space. We find that the regular square\nand kagome lattices exhibit a rigidity percolation transition when the number\nof braces is $\\sim L\\ln L$, where $L$ is the linear size of the lattice. This\ntransition exhibits features of both first order and second order transitions:\nthe whole lattice becomes rigid at the transition, whereas there exists a\ndiverging length scale. In contrast, we find that the rigidity percolation\ntransition in the generic lattices occur when the number of braces is very\nclose to the number obtained from the Maxwell's law for floppy modes, which is\n$\\sim L$. The transition in generic lattices is a very sharp first-order-like\ntransition, at which the addition of one brace connects all small rigid regions\nin the bulk of the lattice, leaving only floppy modes on the edge. We\ncharacterize these transitions using numerical simulations and develop analytic\ntheories capturing each transition. Our results relate to other interesting\nproblems including jamming and bootstrap percolation.\n", "  We study the existence and stability criteria for circular geodesics of\nspherically symmetric tidal charged black hole~(BH). We investigate in details\nthe equatorial causal geodesics of the tidal charged BH in comparison with\nspherically symmetric Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m BH spacetime. We particularly\nfocused on both the null circular geodesics and time-like circular geodesics.\nUsing the effective potential diagram, we have compared the geodesic structure\nbetween two spacetimes. We have derived the ISCO~(innermost stable circular\norbit), MBCO~(marginally bound circular orbit) and CPO~(circular photon orbit)\nfor both the space-times. Moreover, we have derived the \\emph{quasi-normal\nmodes~(QNM) frequency} in the \\emph{eikonal limit} for both the spacetimes via\nLyapunov exponent. In the Appendix section, we have shown that a spherically\nsymmetric tidal-charged BH can act as particle accelerators with ultra-high\ncenter-of-mass~(CM) energy in the limiting case of \\emph{maximal BH tidal\ncharge~($q$)} and it is possible when two neutral particles are colliding near\nthe horizon.\n", "  We investigate how material rigidity acts as a key control parameter for the\nfailure of solids under stress. In both experiments and simulations, we\ndemonstrate that material failure can be continuously tuned by varying the\nunderlying rigidity of the material while holding the amount of disorder\nconstant. As the rigidity transition is approached, failure due to the\napplication of uniaxial stress evolves from brittle cracking to system-spanning\ndiffuse breaking. This evolution in failure behavior can be parameterized by\nthe width of the crack. As a system becomes more and more floppy, this crack\nwidth increases until it saturates at the system size. Thus, the spatial extent\nof the failure zone can be used as a direct probe for material rigidity.\n", "  Study of the polarized heavy quarkonium production in recently proposed QCD\nfactorization formalism requires knowledge of a large number of input\nfragmentation functions (FFs) from a single parton or a heavy quark-antiquark\npair to a polarized heavy quarkonium. In this paper, we calculate these FFs at\nthe input scale in terms of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization. We\nderive all relevant polarized NRQCD long-distance matrix elements based\nsymmetries and propose a self-consistent scheme to define them in arbitrary $d$\ndimensions. We then calculate polarized input FFs contributed from all $S$-wave\nand $P$-wave NRQCD intermediate states. With our calculation of the polarized\ninput FFs, and the partonic hard part available in literatures, the QCD\nfactorization formalism is ready to be applied to polarized heavy quarkonium\nproduction.\n", "  Recently, large families of two-dimensional quantum field theories with\nfactorizing S-matrices have been constructed by the operator-algebraic methods,\nby first showing the existence of observables localized in wedge-shaped\nregions. However, these constructions have been limited to the class of\nS-matrices whose components are analytic in rapidity in the physical strip.\n  In this work, we construct candidates for observables in wedges for scalar\nfactorizing S-matrices with poles in the physical strip and show that they\nweakly commute on a certain domain. We discuss some technical issues concerning\nfurther developments, especially the self-adjointness of the candidate\noperators here and strong commutativity between them.\n", "  The lazy random walk, where the walker has some probability of staying put,\nis a useful tool in classical algorithms. We propose a quantum analogue, the\nlackadaisical quantum walk, where each vertex is given $l$ self-loops, and we\ninvestigate its effects on Grover's algorithm when formulated as search for a\nmarked vertex on the complete graph of $N$ vertices. For the discrete-time\nquantum walk using the phase flip coin, adding a self-loop to each vertex\nboosts the success probability from 1/2 to 1. Additional self-loops, however,\ndecrease the success probability. Using instead the Ambainis, Kempe, and Rivosh\n(2005) coin, adding self-loops simply slows down the search. These coins also\ndiffer in that the first is faster than classical when $l$ scales less than\n$N$, while the second requires that $l$ scale less than $N^2$. Finally,\ncontinuous-time quantum walks differ from both of these discrete-time\nexamples---the self-loops make no difference at all. These behaviors generalize\nto multiple marked vertices.\n", "  We introduce a class of (2+1)-dimensional stochastic growth processes, that\ncan be seen as irreversible random dynamics of discrete interfaces.\n\"Irreversible\" means that the interface has an average non-zero drift.\nInterface configurations correspond to height functions of dimer coverings of\nthe infinite hexagonal or square lattice. The model can also be viewed as an\ninteracting driven particle system and in the totally asymmetric case the\ndynamics corresponds to an infinite collection of mutually interacting\nHammersley processes.\n  When the dynamical asymmetry parameter $(p-q)$ equals zero, the\ninfinite-volume Gibbs measures $\\pi_\\rho$ (with given slope $\\rho$) are\nstationary and reversible. When $p\\ne q$, $\\pi_\\rho$ are not reversible any\nmore but, remarkably, they are still stationary. In such stationary states, we\nfind that the average height function at any given point $x$ grows linearly\nwith time $t$ with a non-zero speed: $\\mathbb E Q_x(t):=\\mathbb\nE(h_x(t)-h_x(0))= V(\\rho) t$ while the typical fluctuations of $Q_x(t)$ are\nsmaller than any power of $t$ as $t\\to\\infty$.\n  In the totally asymmetric case of $p=0,q=1$ and on the hexagonal lattice, the\ndynamics coincides with the \"anisotropic KPZ growth model\" introduced by A.\nBorodin and P. L. Ferrari. For a suitably chosen, \"integrable\", initial\ncondition (that is very far from the stationary state), they were able to\ndetermine the hydrodynamic limit and a CLT for interface fluctuations on scale\n$\\sqrt{\\log t}$, exploiting the fact that in that case certain space-time\nheight correlations can be computed exactly.\n", "  We study the wave equation on one-dimensional self-similar fractal structures\nthat can be analyzed by the spectral decimation method. We develop efficient\nnumerical approximation techniques and also provide uniform estimates obtained\nby analytical methods.\n", "  We show that normalized currents of integration along the common zeros of\nrandom $m$-tuples of sections of powers of $m$ singular Hermitian big line\nbundles on a compact K\\\"ahler manifold distribute asymptotically to the wedge\nproduct of the curvature currents of the metrics. If the Hermitian metrics are\nH\\\"older with singularities we also estimate the speed of convergence.\n", "  The precise tracking of micron sized colloidal particles - held in the\nvicinity of each other using optical tweezers - is an elegant way to gain\ninformation about the particle-particle pair interaction potential. The\naccuracy of the method, however, relies strongly on the tracking precision.\nParticularly the elimination of systematic errors in the position detection due\nto overlapping particle diffraction patterns remains a great challenge. Here we\npropose a template based particle finding algorithm that circumvents these\nproblems by tracking only a fraction of the particle image that is\ninsignificantly affected by nearby colloids. Under realistic experimental\nconditions we show that our algorithm significantly reduces systematic errors\ncompared to standard tracking methods. Moreover our approach should in\nprinciple be applicable to almost arbitrary shaped particles as the template\ncan be adapted to any geometry.\n", "  We establish a construction of the bulk local operators in AdS by considering\nCFT at finite energy scale. Without assuming any prior knowledge about the\nbulk, the normalizable solution to the bulk free field equation automatically\nappears in the field theory arguments. In the radial quantization formalism, we\nfind a properly regularized version of our initial construction. Possible\ngeneralizations beyond pure AdS are also discussed.\n", "  Local existence and well posedness for a class of solutions for the Euler\nPoisson system is shown. These solutions have a density $\\rho$ which either\nfalls off at infinity or has compact support. The solutions have finite mass,\nfinite energy functional and include the static spherical solutions for the\nadiabatic constant $\\gamma=\\frac{6}{5}$. The result is achieved by using\nweighted Sobolev spaces of fractional order and a new non linear estimate which\nallows to estimate the physical density by the regularised non linear matter\nvariable. Gamblin also has studied this setting but using very different\nfunctional spaces. However we believe that the functional setting we use is\nmore appropriate to describe a physical isolated body and more suitable to\nstudy the Newtionan limit.\n", "  We propose a simple architecture based on multimode quantum memories for\ncollective readout of classical information keyed using a pair coherent states,\nexemplified by the well-known binary phase shift keying format. Such a\nconfiguration enables demonstration of the superadditivity effect in classical\ncommunication over quantum channels, where the transmission rate becomes\nenhanced through joint detection applied to multiple channel uses. The proposed\nscheme relies on the recently introduced idea to prepare Hadamard sequences of\ninput symbols that are mapped by a linear optical transformation onto the pulse\nposition modulation format [Guha, S. {\\em Phys. Rev. Lett.}\\ {\\bf 2011}, {\\em\n106}, 240502]. We analyze two versions of readout based on direct detection and\nan optional Dolinar receiver which implements the minimum-error measurement for\nindividual detection of a binary coherent state alphabet.\n", "  Extended Clifford circuits straddle the boundary between classical and\nquantum computational power. Whether such circuits are efficiently classically\nsimulable seems to depend delicately on the ingredients of the circuits. While\nsome combinations of ingredients lead to efficiently classically simulable\ncircuits, other combinations, which might just be slightly different, lead to\ncircuits which are likely not. We extend the results of Jozsa and Van den Nest\n[Quant. Info. Comput. 14, 633 (2014)] by studying two further extensions of\nClifford circuits. First, we consider how the classical simulation complexity\nchanges when we allow for more general measurements. Second, we investigate\ndifferent notions of what it means to \"classically simulate\" a quantum circuit.\nThese further extensions give us 24 new combinations of ingredients compared to\nJozsa and Van den Nest, and we give a complete classification of their\nclassical simulation complexities. Our results provide more examples where\nseemingly modest changes to the ingredients of Clifford circuits lead to\n\"large\" changes in the classical simulation complexities of the circuits, and\nalso include new examples of extended Clifford circuits that exhibit \"quantum\nsupremacy\", in the sense that it is not possible to efficiently classically\nsample from the output distributions of such circuits, unless the polynomial\nhierarchy collapses.\n", "  Using the model of parametric interaction based on the spatio-spectral\nSchmidt modes and generalized parametric approximation, we analyze coherence\nand mode structure of ultra-intense twin beams generated in the regime with\npump depletion. We show that the increase of spatial and spectral coherence\nwith the increasing pump power observed for moderate powers is replaced by the\ndecrease for the pump powers at which pump depletion occurs. This behavior of\ncoherence is opposed to that exhibited by the number of spatio-spectral modes\neffectively constituting the twin beam. The conditions for maximal coherence\nare analyzed considering pump-beam parameters (spectral width, transverse\nradius). The existence of additional coherence maxima occurring at even higher\npump powers is predicted and explained by the oscillatory evolution of the\nmodes' populations.\n", "  Using a first-principles noncollinear wave-function-matching method, we\nstudied the spin-transfer torques (STTs) in CoFe/Mg-B-O/CoFe(001) magnetic\ntunnel junctions (MTJs), where three different types of B-doped MgO in the\nspacer are considered, including B atoms replacing Mg atoms (Mg$_3$BO$_4$), B\natoms replacing O atoms (Mg$_4$BO$_3$), and B atoms occupying interstitial\npositions (Mg$_4$BO$_4$) in MgO. A strong asymmetric angular dependence of STT\ncan be obtained both in ballistic CoFe/Mg$_3$BO$_4$ and CoFe/Mg$_4$BO$_4$ based\nMTJs, whereas a nearly symmetric STT curve is observed in the junctions based\non CoFe/Mg$_4$BO$_3$. Furthermore, the asymmetry of the angular dependence of\nSTT can be suppressed significantly by the disorder of B distribution. Such\nskewness of STTs in the CoFe/Mg-B-O/CoFe MTJs could be attributed to the\ninterfacial resonance states induced by the B diffusion into MgO spacer. The\npresent investigation demonstrates the feasibility of effectively enhancing\nmicrowave output power in MgO based spin torque oscillator (STO) by doping the\nB atoms into MgO spacer.\n", "  A brief summary of the various observations and constraints that underlie\nsolar dynamo research are presented. The arguments that indicate that the solar\ndynamo is an alpha-omega dynamo of the Babcock-Leighton type are then shortly\nreviewed. The main open questions that remain are concerned with the subsurface\ndynamics, including why sunspots emerge at preferred latitudes as seen in the\nfamiliar butterfly wings, why the cycle is about 11 years long, and why the\nsunspot groups emerge tilted with respect to the equator (Joy's law). Next, we\nturn to magnetic helicity, whose conservation property has been identified with\nthe decline of large-scale magnetic fields found in direct numerical\nsimulations at large magnetic Reynolds numbers. However, magnetic helicity\nfluxes through the solar surface can alleviate this problem and connect theory\nwith observations, as will be discussed.\n", "  We present a lattice QCD determination of the vector and scalar form factors\nof the semileptonic $K \\to \\pi \\ell \\nu$ decay which are relevant for the\nextraction of the CKM matrix element $|V_{us}|$ from experimental data. Our\nresults are based on the gauge configurations produced by the European Twisted\nMass Collaboration with $N_f = 2+1+1$ dynamical fermions, which include in the\nsea, besides two light mass degenerate quarks, also the strange and the charm\nquarks. We use data simulated at three different values of the lattice spacing\nand with pion masses as small as $210$ MeV. Our final result for the vector\nform factor at zero momentum transfer is $f_+(0) = 0.9709 (46)$, where the\nuncertainty is both statistical and systematic combined in quadrature. Using\nthe latest experimental value of $f_+(0) |V_{us}|$ from $K_{\\ell 3}$ decays, we\nobtain $|V_{us}| = 0.2230 (11)$, which allows to test the unitarity constraint\nof the Standard Model below the permille level once the determination of\n$|V_{ud}|$ from superallowed nuclear $\\beta$ decays is adopted. A slight\ntension with unitarity at the level of $\\sim 2$ standard deviations is\nobserved. Moreover we present our results for the semileptonic scalar\n$f_0(q^2)$ and vector $f_+(q^2)$ form factors in the whole range of values of\nthe squared four-momentum transfer $q^2$ measured in $K_{\\ell 3}$ decays,\nobtaining a very good agreement with the momentum dependence of the\nexperimental data. We provide a set of synthetic data points representing our\nresults for the vector and scalar form factors at the physical point for\nseveral selected values of $q^2$.\n", "  In the present work the Rabi Problem, involving the response of a spin 1/2\nparticle subjected to a magnetic field, is considered in a second quantized\napproach. In this concrete physical scenario, we show that the second\nquantization procedure can be applied directly in a non-covariant theory. The\nproposed development explicits not only the relation between the full quantum\ntreatment of the problem and the semiclassical Rabi model, but also the\nconnection of these approaches with the Jaynes-Cummings model. The consistency\nof the method is checked in the semiclassical limit. The treatment is then\nextended to the matter component of the Rabi problem so that the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation is directly quantized. Considering the spinorial field, the appearance\nof a negative energy sector implies a specific identification between\nSchr\\\"odinger's and Maxwell's theories. The generalized theory is consistent,\nstrictly quantum and non-relativistic.\n", "  The elastic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of Mo_{2}TiAlC_{2} are\ninvestigated by first-principles calculations. Our results indicate that the a\naxis is stiffer than c axis within 0~100 GPa. Elastic constants calculations\npredict the large stability range of Mo_{2}TiAlC_{2} under pressure. Several\nimportant thermodynamic properties are discussed detailedly, including the\nDebye temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, and heat capacity etc. The\nbonding properties are studied from the elastic quantities and electronic\nproperties. The electronic properties are investigated, including the energy\nband structure, density of states, and so on. The evidence of the instability\nof Mo_{3}AlC_{2} and stability of Mo_{2}TiAlC_{2} are successfully obtained.\n", "  Dispersing graphite in water to obtain true (single layer) graphene (SLG) in\nbulk quantity in a liquid has been an unreachable goal for materials scientists\nin the last decade. Likewise, a diagnostic tool for identifying solubilized SLG\nin situ has been long awaited. Homogeneous stable dispersions of SLG in water\nare obtained by mixing graphenide (negatively charged graphene) solutions in\ntetrahydrofuran (THF) with degassed water and evaporating the organic solvent.\nIn situ Raman spectroscopy of these aqueous dispersions shows all the expected\ncharacteristics of single layer graphene, including an intense 2D band of\nLorentzian shape and linewidth of 28 cm-1. Transmission electron and atomic\nforce microscopies on deposits confirm SLG character. The resulting\nadditive-free stable water dispersions contain 0.16 mg/mL of SLG.\n", "  We propose a scheme to realize a lossless propagation of linear and nonlinear\nAiry surface polaritons (SPs) via active Raman gain (ARG). The system we\nsuggest is a planar interface superposed by a negative index metamaterial\n(NIMM) and a dielectric, where three-level quantum emitters are doped. By using\nthe ARG from the quantum emitters and the destructive interference effect\nbetween the electric and magnetic responses from the NIMM, we show that not\nonly the Ohmic loss of the NIMM but also the light absorption of the quantum\nemitters can be completely eliminated. As a result, non-diffractive Airy SPs\nmay propagate for very long distance without attenuation. We also show that the\nKerr nonlinearity of the system can be largely enhanced due to the introduction\nof the quantum emitters and hence lossless Airy surface polaritonic solitons\nwith very low power can be generated in the system.\n", "  Lattice networks with dissipative interactions can be used to describe the\nmechanics of discrete meso-structures of materials such as 3D-printed\nstructures and foams. This contribution deals with the crack initiation and\npropagation in such materials and focuses on an adaptive multiscale approach\nthat captures the spatially evolving fracture. Lattice networks naturally\nincorporate non-locality, large deformations, and dissipative mechanisms taking\nplace inside fracture zones. Because the physically relevant length scales are\nsignificantly larger than those of individual interactions, discrete models are\ncomputationally expensive. The Quasicontinuum (QC) method is a multiscale\napproach specifically constructed for discrete models. This method reduces the\ncomputational cost by fully resolving the underlying lattice only in regions of\ninterest, while coarsening elsewhere. In this contribution, the (variational)\nQC is applied to damageable lattices for engineering-scale predictions. To deal\nwith the spatially evolving fracture zone, an adaptive scheme is proposed.\nImplications induced by the adaptive procedure are discussed from the\nenergy-consistency point of view, and theoretical considerations are\ndemonstrated on two examples. The first one serves as a proof of concept,\nillustrates the consistency of the adaptive schemes, and presents errors in\nenergies. The second one demonstrates the performance of the adaptive QC scheme\nfor a more complex problem.\n", "  We study the influence of Rydberg dressed interactions in a one-dimensional\n(1D) Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). We show that a 1D geometry offers several\nadvantages over 3D for observing BEC Rydberg dressing. The effects of dressing\nare studied by investigating collective BEC dynamics after a rapid switch-off\nof the Rydberg dressing interaction. The results can be interpreted as an\neffective modification of the s-wave scattering length. We include this\nmodification in an analytical model for the 1D BEC, and compare it to numerical\ncalculations of Rydberg dressing under realistic experimental conditions.\n", "  The BeatBox simulation environment combines flexible script language user\ninterface with the robust computational tools, in order to setup cardiac\nelectrophysiology in-silico experiments without re-coding at low-level, so that\ncell excitation, tissue/anatomy models, stimulation protocols may be included\ninto a BeatBox script, and simulation run either sequentially or in parallel\n(MPI) without re-compilation. BeatBox is a free software written in C language\nto be run on a Unix-based platform. It provides the whole spectrum of multi\nscale tissue modelling from 0-dimensional individual cell simulation,\n1-dimensional fibre, 2-dimensional sheet and 3-dimensional slab of tissue, up\nto anatomically realistic whole heart simulations, with run time measurements\nincluding cardiac re-entry tip/filament tracing, ECG, local/global samples of\nany variables, etc. BeatBox solvers, cell, and tissue/anatomy models\nrepositories are extended via robust and flexible interfaces, thus providing an\nopen framework for new developments in the field. In this paper we give an\noverview of the BeatBox current state, together with a description of the main\ncomputational methods and MPI parallelisation approaches.\n", "  The null result in the LHC may indicate that the standard model is not\ndrastically modified up to very high scales such as the GUT/string scale.\nHaving this in the mind, we suggest a novel leptogenesis scenario realized in\nthe false vacuum of the Higgs field. If the Higgs field develops a large vacuum\nexpectation value in the early universe, a lepton number violating process is\nenhanced, which we use for baryogenesis. To demonstrate the scenario, several\nmodels are discussed. For example, we show that the observed baryon asymmetry\nis successfully generated in the standard model with higher-dimensional\noperators.\n", "  Intense spatio-spectral twin beams generated in the regime with pump\ndepletion are analyzed applying a suggested quantum model that treats the\nsignal, idler and pump fields in the same way. The model assumes the signal and\nidler fields in the form of the generalized superposition of signal and noise\nand reveals nonzero signal coherent components in both fields, contrary to the\nmodels developed earlier. The influence of coherent components on the\nproperties of intense twin beams is elucidated. The interference pattern formed\nin the process of sum-frequency generation and that of the Hong-Ou-Mandel\ninterferometer are shown to be able to experimentally confirm the presence of\ncoherent components.\n", "  In this paper we complete the presentation of a new hybrid $2\\times2$D flux\ntransport dynamo (FTD) model of the solar cycle based on the Babcock-Leighton\nmechanism of poloidal magnetic field regeneration via the surface decay of\nbipolar magnetic regions (BMRs). This hybrid model is constructed by allowing\nthe surface flux transport (SFT) simulation described in Lemerle et al. 2015 to\nprovide the poloidal source term to an axisymmetric FTD simulation defined in a\nmeridional plane, which in turn generates the BMRs required by the SFT. A key\naspect of this coupling is the definition of an emergence function describing\nthe probability of BMR emergence as a function of the spatial distribution of\nthe internal axisymmetric magnetic field. We use a genetic algorithm to\ncalibrate this function, together with other model parameters, against observed\ncycle 21 emergence data. We present a reference dynamo solution reproducing\nmany solar cycle characteristics, including good hemispheric coupling, phase\nrelationship between the surface dipole and the BMR-generating internal field,\nand correlation between dipole strength at cycle maximum and peak amplitude of\nthe next cycle. The saturation of the cycle amplitude takes place through the\nquenching of the BMR tilt as a function of the internal field. The observed\nstatistical scatter about the mean BMR tilt, built into the model, acts as a\nsource of stochasticity which dominates amplitude fluctuations. The model thus\ncan produce Dalton-like epochs of strongly suppressed cycle amplitude lasting a\nfew cycles and can even shut off entirely following an unfavorable sequence of\nemergence events.\n", "  We propose a novel method for reducing the number of variables in quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization problems, using a quantum annealer (or any\nsampler) to fix the value of a large portion of the variables to values that\nhave a high probability of being optimal. The resulting problems are usually\nmuch easier for the quantum annealer to solve, due to their being smaller and\nconsisting of disconnected components. This approach significantly increases\nthe success rate and number of observations of the best known energy value in\nsamples obtained from the quantum annealer, when compared with calling the\nquantum annealer without using it, even when using fewer annealing cycles. Use\nof the method results in a considerable improvement in success metrics even for\nproblems with high-precision couplers and biases, which are more challenging\nfor the quantum annealer to solve. The results are further enhanced by applying\nthe method iteratively and combining it with classical pre-processing. We\npresent results for both Chimera graph-structured problems and embedded\nproblems from a real-world application.\n", "  Simultaneous Kerr comb formation and second-harmonic generation with on-chip\nmicroresonators can greatly facilitate comb self-referencing for optical clocks\nand frequency metrology. Moreover, the presence of both second- and third-order\nnonlinearities results in complex cavity dynamics that is of high scientific\ninterest but is still far from well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the\ninteraction between the fundamental and the second-harmonic waves can provide\nan entirely new way of phase-matching for four-wave mixing in optical\nmicroresonators, enabling the generation of optical frequency combs in the\nnormal dispersion regime, under conditions where comb creation is ordinarily\nprohibited. We derive new coupled time-domain mean-field equations and obtain\nsimulation results showing good qualitative agreement with our experimental\nobservations. Our findings provide a novel way of overcoming the dispersion\nlimit for simultaneous Kerr comb formation and second-harmonic generation,\nwhich might prove especially important in the near-visible to visible range\nwhere several atomic transitions commonly used for stabilization of optical\nclocks are located and where the large normal material dispersion is likely to\ndominate.\n", "  We propose a limited class of models, describing interacting chiral\nmultiplets with a non-minimal coupling to a vector multiplet, in curved\nsuperspace of $N=1$ supergravity. Those models are suitable for the\ninflationary model building in supergravity with inflaton assigned to a massive\nvector multiplet and spontaneous SUSY breaking in Minkowski vacuum after\ninflation, for any values of the inflationary parameters $n_s$ and $r$, and any\nscale of SUSY breaking.\n", "  Using the shuffle structure of the graphs, we introduce a new kind of the\nHopf algebraic structure for tagged graphs with, or without loops. Like a\nquantum group structure, its product is non-commutative. With the help of the\nHopf algebraic structure, after taking account symmetry of the tagged graphs,\nwe reconstruct the topological recursion on spectral curves proposed by B.\nEynard and N. Orantin, which includes the one-loop equations of various matrix\nintegrals as special cases.\n", "  The transport coefficients induced by the Anderson-Witting approximation of\nthe collision term in the relativistic Boltzmann equation are derived for close\nto equilibrium flows in general relativity. Using the tetrad formalism, it is\nshown that the expression for these coefficients is the same as that obtained\non flat space-time, in agreement with the generalized equivalence principle.\n", "  A quadrature-based finite-difference lattice Boltzmann model is developed\nthat is suitable for simulating relativistic flows of massless particles. We\nbriefly review the relativistc Boltzmann equation and present our model. The\nquadrature is constructed such that the stress-energy tensor is obtained as a\nsecond order moment of the distribution function. The results obtained with our\nmodel are presented for a particular instance of the Riemann problem (the Sod\nshock tube). We show that the model is able to accurately capture the behavior\nacross the whole domain of relaxation times, from the hydrodynamic to the\nballistic regime. The property of the model of being extendable to arbitrarily\nhigh orders is shown to be paramount for the recovery of the analytical result\nin the ballistic regime.\n", "  We define the hitting time for a model of continuous-time open quantum walks\nin terms of quantum jumps. Our starting point is a master equation in Lindblad\nform, which can be taken as the quantum analogue of the rate equation for a\nclassical continuous-time Markov chain. The quantum jump method is well known\nin the quantum optics community and has also been applied to simulate open\nquantum walks in discrete time. This method however, is well-suited to\ncontinuous-time problems. It is shown here that a continuous-time hitting\nproblem is amenable to analysis via quantum jumps: The hitting time can be\ndefined as the time of the first jump. Using this fact, we derive the\ndistribution of hitting times and explicit exressions for its statistical\nmoments. Simple examples are considered to illustrate the final results. We\nthen show that the hitting statistics obtained via quantum jumps is consistent\nwith a previous definition for a measured walk in discrete time\n[Phys.~Rev.~A~{\\bf 73}, 032341 (2006)] (when generalised to allow for\nnon-unitary evolution and in the limit of small time steps). A caveat of the\nquantum-jump approach is that it relies on the final state (the state which we\nwant to hit) to share only incoherent edges with other vertices in the graph.\nWe propose a simple remedy to restore the applicability of quantum jumps when\nthis is not the case and show that the hitting-time statistics will again\nconverge to that obtained from the measured discrete walk in appropriate\nlimits.\n", "  We consider a bipartite quantum system $S$ (including parties $A$ and $B$),\ninteracting with an environment $E$ through a localized quantum dynamics\n$\\mathcal{F}_{SE}$ . We call a quantum dynamics $\\mathcal{F}_{SE}$ localized\nif, e.g., the party $A$ is isolated from the environment and only $B$ interacts\nwith the environment: $\\mathcal{F}_{SE}=id_{A}\\otimes \\mathcal{F}_{BE}$, where\n$id_{A}$ is the identity map on the part $A$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{BE}$ is a\ncompletely positive (CP) map on the both $B$ and $E$. We will show that the\nreduced dynamics of the system is also localized as\n$\\mathcal{E}_{S}=id_{A}\\otimes \\bar{\\mathcal{E}}_{B}$, where\n$\\bar{\\mathcal{E}}_{B}$ is a CP map on $B$, if and only if the initial state of\nthe system-environment is a Markov state. We then generalize this result to the\ntwo following cases: when both $A$ and $B$ interact with a same environment,\nand when each party interacts with its local environment.\n", "  While pyrochlore iridate thin films are theoretically predicted to possess a\nvariety of emergent topological properties, experimental verification of these\npredictions can be obstructed by the challenge in thin film growth. Here we\nreport on the pulsed laser deposition and characterization of thin films of a\nrepresentative pyrochlore compound Bi2Ir2O7. The films were epitaxially grown\non yttria-stabilized zirconia substrates and have lattice constants that are a\nfew percent larger than that of the bulk single crystals. The film composition\nshows a strong dependence on the oxygen partial pressure.\nDensity-functional-theory calculations indicate the existence of Bi_Ir antisite\ndefects, qualitatively consistent with the high Bi: Ir ratio found in the\nfilms. Both Ir and Bi have oxidation states that are lower than their nominal\nvalues, suggesting the existence of oxygen deficiency. The iridate thin films\nshow a variety of intriguing transport characteristics, including multiple\ncharge carriers, logarithmic dependence of resistance on temperature,\nantilocalization corrections to conductance due to spin-orbit interactions, and\nlinear positive magnetoresistance.\n", "  We give a quantum algorithm for solving semidefinite programs (SDPs). It has\nworst-case running time $n^{\\frac{1}{2}} m^{\\frac{1}{2}} s^2\n\\text{poly}(\\log(n), \\log(m), R, r, 1/\\delta)$, with $n$ and $s$ the dimension\nand row-sparsity of the input matrices, respectively, $m$ the number of\nconstraints, $\\delta$ the accuracy of the solution, and $R, r$ a upper bounds\non the size of the optimal primal and dual solutions. This gives a square-root\nunconditional speed-up over any classical method for solving SDPs both in $n$\nand $m$. We prove the algorithm cannot be substantially improved (in terms of\n$n$ and $m$) giving a $\\Omega(n^{\\frac{1}{2}}+m^{\\frac{1}{2}})$ quantum lower\nbound for solving semidefinite programs with constant $s, R, r$ and $\\delta$.\n  The quantum algorithm is constructed by a combination of quantum Gibbs\nsampling and the multiplicative weight method. In particular it is based on a\nclassical algorithm of Arora and Kale for approximately solving SDPs. We\npresent a modification of their algorithm to eliminate the need for solving an\ninner linear program which may be of independent interest.\n", "  Microresonator-based Kerr frequency comb (microcomb) generation can\npotentially revolutionize a variety of applications ranging from\ntelecommunications to optical frequency synthesis. However, phase-locked\nmicrocombs have generally had low conversion efficiency limited to a few\npercent. Here we report experimental results that achieve ~30% conversion\nefficiency (~200 mW on-chip comb power excluding the pump) in the fiber\ntelecommunication band with broadband mode-locked dark-pulse combs. We present\na general analysis on the efficiency which is applicable to any phase-locked\nmicrocomb state. The effective coupling condition for the pump as well as the\nduty cycle of localized time-domain structures play a key role in determining\nthe conversion efficiency. Our observation of high efficiency comb states is\nrelevant for applications such as optical communications which require high\npower per comb line.\n", "  This paper presents the QAMDiagnos, a model of Quantum Associative Memory\n(QAM) that can be a helpful tool for medical staff without experience or\nlaboratory facilities, for the diagnosis of four tropical diseases (malaria,\ntyphoid fever, yellow fever and dengue) which have several similar signs and\nsymptoms. The memory can distinguish a single infection from a polyinfection.\nOur model is a combination of the improved versions of the original linear\nquantum retrieving algorithm proposed by Ventura and the non-linear quantum\nsearch algorithm of Abrams and Lloyd. From the given simulation results, it\nappears that the efficiency of recognition is good when particular signs and\nsymptoms of a disease are inserted given that the linear algorithm is the main\nalgorithm. The non-linear algorithm helps confirm or correct the diagnosis or\ngive some advice to the medical staff for the treatment. So, our QAMDiagnos\nthat has a friendly graphical user interface for desktop and smart-phone is a\nsensitive and a low-cost diagnostic tool that enables rapid and accurate\ndiagnosis of four tropical diseases.\n", "  In our previous paper (Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 89}, 165430 (2014)) we have found\nthat in graphene, in distinction to the four occupied bands, which can be\ndescribed by the simple tight-binding model (TBM) with four atomic orbitals per\natom, the two lowest lying at the $\\Gamma$-point unoccupied bands (one of them\nof a $\\sigma$ type and the other of a $\\pi$ type) can not be described by such\nmodel. In the present work we suggest a minimalistic model for these two bands,\nbased on (nearly) free electrons model (FEM), which correctly describes the\nsymmetry of these bands, their dispersion law and their localization with\nrespect to the graphene plane.\n", "  We present some generalizations of quantum information inequalities involving\ntracial positive linear maps between $C^*$-algebras. Among several results, we\nestablish a noncommutative Heisenberg uncertainty relation. More precisely, we\nshow that if $\\Phi: \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{B}$ is a tracial positive linear\nmap between $C^*$-algebras , $\\rho \\in \\mathcal{A}$ is a $\\Phi$-density element\nand $A,B$ are self-adjoint operators of $\\mathcal{A}$ such that $ {\\rm\nsp}(\\mbox{-i}\\rho^\\frac{1}{2}[A,B]\\rho^\\frac{1}{2}) \\subseteq [m,M] $ for some\nscalers $0<m<M$, then under some conditions \\begin{eqnarray}\\label{inemain1}\nV_{\\rho,\\Phi}(A)\\sharp V_{\\rho,\\Phi}(B)\\geq\n\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{K_{m,M}(\\rho[A,B])}} \\left|\\Phi(\\rho [A,B])\\right|,\n\\end{eqnarray} where $K_{m,M}(\\rho[A,B])$ is the Kantorovich constant of the\noperator $\\mbox{-i}\\rho^\\frac{1}{2}[A,B]\\rho^\\frac{1}{2}$ and\n$V_{\\rho,\\Phi}(X)$ is the generalized variance of $X$.\\\\ In addition, we use\nsome arguments differing from the scalar theory to present some inequalities\nrelated to the generalized correlation and the generalized\nWigner--Yanase--Dyson skew information.\n", "  We propose and analyze two distinct routes toward realizing interacting\nsymmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases via periodic driving. First, we\ndemonstrate that a driven transverse-field Ising model can be used to engineer\ncomplex interactions which enable the emulation of an equilibrium SPT phase.\nThis phase remains stable only within a parametric time scale controlled by the\ndriving frequency, beyond which its topological features break down. To\novercome this issue, we consider an alternate route based upon realizing an\nintrinsically Floquet SPT phase that does not have any equilibrium analog. In\nboth cases, we show that disorder, leading to many-body localization, prevents\nrunaway heating and enables the observation of coherent quantum dynamics at\nhigh energy densities. Furthermore, we clarify the distinction between the\nequilibrium and Floquet SPT phases by identifying a unique micromotion-based\nentanglement spectrum signature of the latter. Finally, we propose a unifying\nimplementation in a one-dimensional chain of Rydberg-dressed atoms and show\nthat protected edge modes are observable on realistic experimental time scales.\n", "  We investigate the competition between the electron-vibron interaction\n(interaction with the Jahn-Teller phonons) and the Coulomb repulsion in a\nsystem with local pairing of electrons on the triply degenerate lowest\nunoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The electron-vibron interaction radically\nchanges conductivity and magnetic properties of alkali-doped fullerides AnC60,\nwhich should be antiferromagnetic Mott insulators: we have found that materials\nwith n=1,2 and A=K,Rb are conductors but not superconductors; n=3 and A=K,Rb\nare conductors (superconductors at low temperatures), but with A=Cs are Mott\ninsulators at normal pressure; n=2,4 are nonmagnetic Mott insulators. We have\nshown that superconductivity, conductivity and insulation of these materials\nhave common nature. Based on the alkali-doped fullerides we propose a\nhypothetical material with a significantly higher critical temperature using\nthe model of superconductivity with the external pair potential formulated in a\nwork K.V. Grigorishin Phys. Lett. A 381 3089 (2017).\n", "  Topological magnetic textures - like skyrmions - have become a major player\nin the design of next-generation magnetic storage technology due to their\nstability and the control of their motion by ultra-low current densities. A\nmajor challenge to develop this new skyrmion-based technology is to achieve the\ncontrolled and deterministic creation of magnetic skyrmions without the need of\ncomplex setups. We demonstrate a solution to this challenge by showing how to\ncreate skyrmions and other magnetic textures in ferromagnetic thin films by\nmeans of a homogeneous DC current and without requiring Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteractions. This is possible by exploiting a static loss of stability arising\nfrom the interplay of current-induced spin-transfer torque and a spatially\ninhomogeneous magnetization, which can be achieved, e.g., by locally\nengineering the anisotropy, the magnetic field, or other magnetic interactions.\nThe magnetic textures are created controllably, efficiently, and periodically\nwith a period that can be tuned by the applied current strength. We propose\nspecific experimental setups realizable with simple materials, such as cobalt\nbased materials, to observe the periodic formation of skyrmions. We show that\nadding chiral interactions will not influence the basics of the generations but\nthen influence the consequent dynamics with respect to the stabilization of\ntopological textures. Our findings allow for the production of skyrmions on\ndemand in simple ferromagnetic thin films by homogeneous DC currents.\n", "  A central question in quantum computation is to identify the resources that\nare responsible for quantum speed-up. Quantum contextuality has been recently\nshown to be a resource for quantum computation with magic states for odd-prime\ndimensional qudits and two-dimensional systems with real wavefunctions. The\nphenomenon of state-independent contextuality poses a priori an obstruction to\ncharacterizing the case of regular qubits, the fundamental building block of\nquantum computation. Here, we establish contextuality of magic states as a\nnecessary resource for a large class of quantum computation schemes on qubits.\nWe illustrate our result with a concrete scheme related to measurement-based\nquantum computation.\n", "  The quasiclassical theory in terms of equations for the Green's functions\n(Eilenberger equations) is generalized in order to allow for quantitative\ndescription of the magneto-electric effects and proximity-induced triplet\ncorrelations in the presence of spin-orbit coupling in hybrid superconducting\nsystems. The formalism is valid under the condition that the spin-orbit\ncoupling is weak with respect to the Fermi energy, but exceeds the\nsuperconducting energy scale considerably. On the basis of the derived\nformalism it is shown that the triplet correlations in the spin-orbit coupled\nnormal metal can be induced by proximity to a singlet superconductor without\nany exchange or external magnetic field. They contain an odd-frequency\neven-momentum component, which is stable against disorder. The value of the\nproximity-induced triplet correlations is of the order of\n$\\Delta_{so}/\\varepsilon_F$, that is absent in the framework of the standard\nquasiclassical approximation, but can be described by our theory. The spin\npolarization, induced by the Josephson current flowing through the\nsuperconductor/Rashba metal/superconductor junction, is also calculated.\n", "  Here we propose the existence of a non-static ground state in the Kondo\ninsulator SmB6, with a unique accompany-type valence fluctuation of Sm ions in\nits bulk. Whether SmB6 is a fashion of time crystal is an intriguing issue.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of model microswimmers under confinement, in\ncylindrical geometries, by means of three dimensional direct numerical\ncalculations with fully resolved hydrodynamics. Such swimmers are known to show\ncollective alignment in bulk, and we confirmed that similar alignment can be\nobserved even in pipes, although the volume fraction dependency shows\nqualitative differences. By comparing the structural information, we\ninvestigated the cause of such differences. We found an order/disorder phase\ntransition for a specific type of swimmers, as the size of the pipe becomes\ncomparable to the size of the swimmers. Such dynamics are found not to depend\non the geometry of confinement.\n", "  We study quench dynamics and equilibration in one-dimensional quantum\nhydrodynamics, which provides effective descriptions of the density and\nvelocity fields in gapless quantum gases. We show that the information content\nof the large time steady state is inherently connected to the presence of\nballistically moving localised excitations. When such excitations are present,\nthe system retains memory of initial correlations up to infinite times, thus\nevading decoherence. We demonstrate this connection in the context of the\nLuttinger model, the simplest quantum hydrodynamic model, and in the quantum\nKdV equation. In the standard Luttinger model, memory of all initial\ncorrelations is preserved throughout the time evolution up to infinitely large\ntimes, as a result of the purely ballistic dynamics. However nonlinear\ndispersion or interactions, when separately present, lead to spreading and\ndelocalisation that suppress the above effect by eliminating the memory of\nnon-Gaussian correlations. We show that, for any initial state that satisfies\nsufficient clustering of correlations, the steady state is Gaussian in terms of\nthe bosonised or fermionised fields in the dispersive or interacting case\nrespectively. On the other hand, when dispersion and interaction are\nsimultaneously present, a semiclassical approximation suggests that\nlocalisation is restored as the two effects compensate each other and solitary\nwaves are formed. Solitary waves, or simply solitons, are experimentally\nobserved in quantum gases and theoretically predicted based on semiclassical\napproaches, but the question of their stability at the quantum level remains to\na large extent an open problem. We give a general overview on the subject and\ndiscuss the relevance of our findings to general out of equilibrium problems.\n", "  In this work we used dissipative particle dynamics simulations to study the\ncopolymerization process in the presence of spatial heterogeneities caused by\nincompatibility between polymerizing monomers. The polymer sequence details as\nwell as the resulting system spatial structure in the case if phase segregation\noccurs during the chain growth can be predicted using the method. We performed\nthe model verification with the available literature data on styrene-acrylic\nacid copolymerization in the bulk and a very good agreement between\nexperimental and simulated data for both chain average composition and triad\nfractions was observed. Next, we studied the system properties for a model\nsymmetric reaction process with the reactivity ratios r1 = r2 = 0.5 at\ndifferent compositions and Flory-Huggins parameters \\c{hi}. We found that the\nsystem average copolymer \"composition-feed\" curve does not depend on the\n\\c{hi}-value, but there are significant changes in the copolymer sequences\ncaused by the density fluctuations. Finally, we investigated the formation of\ngradient copolymers during living styrene-acrylic acid copolymerization at a\nhighly asymmetrical feed composition.\n", "  Hydrodynamical simulations are increasingly able to accurately model physical\nsystems on stellar, galactic, and cosmological scales, however, the utility of\nthese simulations is often limited by our ability to directly compare them with\nthe datasets produced by observers: spectra, photometry, etc. To address this\nproblem, we have created Trident}, a Python-based, open-source tool for\npost-processing hydrodynamical simulations to produce synthetic absorption\nspectra and related data. Trident} can (i) create absorption-line spectra for\nany trajectory through a simulated dataset mimicking both background quasar and\ndown-the-barrel configurations, (ii) reproduce the spectral characteristics of\ncommon instruments like the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, (iii) operate across\nthe ultraviolet, optical and infrared using customizable absorption line lists,\n(iv) trace simulated physical structures directly to spectral features, (v)\napproximate the presence of ion species absent from the simulation outputs,\n(vi) generate column density maps for any ion, and (vii) provide support for\nall major astrophysical hydrodynamical codes. The focus of Trident's\ndevelopment is for using simulated datasets to better interpret observations of\nthe circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM), but it remains\na general tool applicable in other contexts.\n", "  We consider conformal gravity boundary conditions and outline the highest\ndimensional non-trivial asymptotic symmetry algebras of conformal gravity. The\nhighest among them is five dimensional and leads to a global geon solution.\n", "  Port-based teleportation (PBT), introduced in 2008, is a type of quantum\nteleportation protocol which transmits the state to the receiver without\nrequiring any corrections on the receiver's side. Evaluating the performance of\nPBT was computationally intractable and previous attempts succeeded only with\nsmall systems. We study PBT protocols and fully characterize their performance\nfor arbitrary dimensions and number of ports. We develop new mathematical tools\nto study the symmetries of the measurement operators that arise in these\nprotocols and belong to the algebra of partially transposed permutation\noperators. First, we develop the representation theory of the mentioned algebra\nwhich provides an elegant way of understanding the properties of subsystems of\na large system with general symmetries. In particular, we introduce the theory\nof the partially reduced irreducible representations which we use to obtain a\nsimpler representation of the algebra of partially transposed permutation\noperators and thus explicitly determine the properties of any PBT scheme for\nfixed dimension in polynomial time.\n", "  Electro-quasistatic field problems involving nonlinear materials are commonly\ndiscretized in space using finite elements. In this paper, it is proposed to\nsolve the resulting system of ordinary differential equations by an explicit\nRunge-Kutta-Chebyshev time-integration scheme. This mitigates the need for\nNewton-Raphson iterations, as they are necessary within fully implicit time\nintegration schemes. However, the electro-quasistatic system of ordinary\ndifferential equations has a Laplace-type mass matrix such that parts of the\nexplicit time-integration scheme remain implicit. An iterative solver with\nconstant preconditioner is shown to efficiently solve the resulting multiple\nright-hand side problem. This approach allows an efficient parallel\nimplementation on a system featuring multiple graphic processing units.\n", "  In this study we analyze {\\sl Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)} and Hi-C\nimages in order to investigate absolute limits for the finest loop strands. We\ndevelop a model of the occurrence-size distribution function of coronal loop\nwidths, characterized by a lower limit of widths $w_{min}$, a peak width $w_p$,\na peak occurrence number $n_p$, and a power law slope $a$. Our data analysis\nincludes automated tracing of curvi-linear features with the OCCULT-2 code,\nautomated sampling of the cross-sectional widths of coronal loops, and fitting\nof the theoretical size distribution to the observed distribution. With\nMonte-Carlo simulations and variable pixel sizes $\\Delta x$ we derive a first\ndiagnostic criterion to discriminate whether the loop widths are unresolved\n$(w_p/\\Delta x \\approx 2.5\\pm0.2)$, or fully resolved (if $w_p/\\Delta x >\n2.7$). For images with resolved loop widths we can apply a second diagnostic\ncriterion that predicts the lower limit of loop widths, $w_{min} \\approx 3\n(\\Delta x_{crit}-0.37\")$ as a function of the critical resolution $\\Delta\nx_{crit}$. We find that the loop widths are marginally resolved in AIA images,\nbut are fully resolved in Hi-C images, where our model predicts a lower limit\nof loop widths at $w_{min} \\approx 100$ km and a most frequent (peak) value at\n$w_p \\approx 300$ km, in agreement with recent results of Brooks et al. This\nresult agrees with the statistics of photospheric granulation sizes and thus\nsupports coronal heating mechanisms operating on the macroscopic scale of\nphotospheric magneto-convection, rather than nanoflare heating models with\nunresolved microscopic scales.\n", "  It is discussed breaking the isotopic symmetry as the tool of studying the\nmechanism production and nature of light scalar mesons.\n", "  There is an emerging class of microfluidic bioreactors which possess\nlong-term, closed circuit perfusion under sterile conditions with in vivo-like\nflow parameters. Integrated into microfluidics, peristaltic-like pneumatically\nactuated displacement micropumps are able to meet these requirements. We\npresent both a theoretical and experimental characterization of such pumps. In\norder to examine volume flow rate, we have developed a mathemati- cal model\ndescribing membrane motion under external pressure. The viscoelasticity of the\nmembrane and hydrodynamic resistance of the microfluidic channel have been\ntaken into account. Unlike other models, the developed model includes only the\nphysical parameters of the pump and allows the estimation of their impact on\nthe resulting flow. The model has been validated experimentally.\n", "  The single-layered ruthenate Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has attracted a great deal of\ninterest as a spin-triplet superconductor with an order parameter that may\npotentially break time reversal invariance and host half-quantized vortices\nwith Majorana zero modes. While the actual nature of the superconducting state\nis still a matter of controversy, it has long been believed that it condenses\nfrom a metallic state that is well described by a conventional Fermi liquid. In\nthis work we use a combination of Fourier transform scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy (FT-STS) and momentum resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy\n(M-EELS) to probe interaction effects in the normal state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Our\nhigh-resolution FT-STS data show signatures of the \\beta-band with a distinctly\nquasi-one-dimensional (1D) character. The band dispersion reveals surprisingly\nstrong interaction effects that dramatically renormalize the Fermi velocity,\nsuggesting that the normal state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is that of a 'correlated\nmetal' where correlations are strengthened by the quasi 1D nature of the bands.\nIn addition, kinks at energies of approximately 10meV, 38meV and 70meV are\nobserved. By comparing STM and M-EELS data we show that the two higher energy\nfeatures arise from coupling with collective modes. The strong correlation\neffects and the kinks in the quasi 1D bands may provide important information\nfor understanding the superconducting state. This work opens up a unique\napproach to revealing the superconducting order parameter in this compound.\n", "  For time integration of transient eddy current problems commonly implicit\ntime integration methods are used, where in every time step one or several\nnonlinear systems of equations have to be linearized with the Newton-Raphson\nmethod due to ferromagnetic materials involved. In this paper, a generalized\nSchur-complement is applied to the magnetic vector potential formulation, which\nconverts a differential-algebraic equation system of index 1 into a system of\nordinary differential equations (ODE) with reduced stiffness. For the time\nintegration of this ODE system of equations, the explicit Euler method is\napplied. The Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL) stability criterion of explicit time\nintegration methods may result in small time steps. Applying a pseudo-inverse\nof the discrete curl-curl operator in nonconducting regions of the problem is\nrequired in every time step. For the computation of the pseudo-inverse, the\npreconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is used. The cascaded Subspace\nExtrapolation method (CSPE) is presented to produce suitable start vectors for\nthese PCG iterations. The resulting scheme is validated using the TEAM 10\nbenchmark problem.\n", "  Are quantum states real? This most fundamental question in quantum mechanics\nhas not yet been satisfactorily resolved, although its realistic interpretation\nseems to have been rejected by various delayed-choice experiments. Here, to\naddress this long-standing issue, we present a quantum twisted double-slit\nexperiment. By exploiting the subluminal feature of twisted photons, the real\nnature of a photon during its time in flight is revealed for the first time. We\nfound that photons' arrival times were inconsistent with the states obtained in\nmeasurements but agreed with the states during propagation. Our results\ndemonstrate that wavefunctions describe the realistic existence and evolution\nof quantum entities rather than a pure mathematical abstraction providing a\nprobability list of measurement outcomes. This finding clarifies the long-held\nmisunderstanding of the role of wavefunctions and their collapse in the\nevolution of quantum entities.\n", "  Results are reported from a search for physics beyond-the-standard-model,\nsuch as supersymmetry, in final states with at least three charged leptons, in\nany combination of electrons or muons. The data sample corresponds to an\nintegrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at\nsqrt(s) = 13 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2015. Two jets\nare required in each event, providing good sensitivity to strong production of\ngluinos and squarks. The search regions, sensitive to a range of different\nsupersymmetry scenarios, are defined using the number of jets tagged as\noriginating from bottom quarks, the sum of the magnitudes of the transverse\nmomenta of the jets, the imbalance in the overall transverse momentum in the\nevent, and the invariant mass of opposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs. The\nevent yields observed in data are consistent with the expected background\ncontributions from standard model processes. These results are used to derive\nlimits in terms of R-parity conserving simplified models of supersymmetry that\ndescribe strong production of gluinos and squarks. Model-independent limits are\npresented to facilitate the reinterpretation of the results in a broad range of\nscenarios for physics beyond the standard model.\n", "  Phase diffusion invariably accompanies all phase estimation strategies --\nquantum or classical. A precise estimation of the former can often provide\nvaluable understanding of the physics of the phase generating phenomena itself.\nWe theoretically examine the performance of fixed-particle number probe states\nin the simultaneous estimation of phase and collective phase diffusion. We\nderive analytical quantum limits associated with the simultaneous local\nestimation of phase and phase diffusion within the quantum Cramer-Rao bound\nframework in the regimes of large and small phase diffusive noise. The former\nis for a general fixed-particle number state and the latter for Holland Burnett\nstates, for which we show quantum-enhanced estimation of phase as well as phase\ndiffusion. We next investigate the simultaneous attainability of these quantum\nlimits using projective measurements acting on a single copy of the state in\nterms of a trade-off relation. In particular, we are interested how this\ntrade-off varies as a function of the dimension of the state. We derive an\nanalytical bound for this trade-off in the large phase diffusion regime for a\nparticular form of the measurement, and show that the maximum of 2, set by the\nquantum Cramer-Rao bound, is attainable. Further, we show numerical evidence\nthat as diffusion approaches zero, the optimal trade-off relation approaches 1\nfor Holland-Burnett states. These numerical results are valid in the small\nparticle number regime and suggest that the trade-off for estimating one\nparameter with quantum-limited precision leads to a complete lack of precision\nfor the other parameter as the diffusion strength approaches zero. Finally, we\nprovide numerical results showing behaviour of the trade-off for a general\nvalue of phase diffusion when using Holland-Burnett probe states.\n", "  We consider a periodically $\\delta$-kicked Graphene system with the kicking\napplied in the $\\hat{z}$ direction. This is known to open a gap at the Dirac\npoints by breaking inversion symmetry through the introduction of a\ntime-varying staggered sub-lattice potential. We look here at the topological\nproperties of the gap closing-opening transition that occurs as functions of\nthe driving amplitude. The dependence of the driving induced mass-term and the\nBerry curvature on the strength of the driving is computed. The Chern number\nfor the gapped-out points is computed numerically and it's variation with the\ndriving amplitude is studied. We observe that though the z-kicked Graphene\nsystem being time-reversal invariant remains topologically trivial in the bulk,\nit still permits a quantification of the topological changes that occur at\nindividual gaps with changes in the sign of the mass term. Note:In Sec.II\nC,page 5, equations 10 & 11 have typos (in the denominators of these equations\n,the parentheses appearing after $\\cos^2(\\alpha_z)$ should appear before\nit).Eq.12 has a missing term which is independent of the wavevector.This\nfollows from there being typos in eq.9 where in the numerators of the\ncoefficients of $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ the $\\alpha_z$ multiplied to the second\nterm has to be dropped in both cases.This follows through to eqs. 10,11 and 12.\n", "  In numerical simulations of classical and quantum lattice systems, 2d corner\ntransfer matrices (CTMs) and 3d corner tensors (CTs) are a useful tool to\ncompute approximate contractions of infinite-size tensor networks. In this\npaper we show how the numerical CTMs and CTs can be used, {\\it additionally\\/},\nto extract universal information from their spectra. We provide examples of\nthis for classical and quantum systems, in 1d, 2d and 3d. Our results provide,\nin particular, practical evidence for a wide variety of models of the\ncorrespondence between $d$-dimensional quantum and $(d+1)$-dimensional\nclassical spin systems. We show also how corner properties can be used to\npinpoint quantum phase transitions, topological or not, without the need for\nobservables. Moreover, for a chiral topological PEPS we show by examples that\ncorner tensors can be used to extract the entanglement spectrum of half a\nsystem, with the expected symmetries of the $SU(2)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model\ndescribing its gapless edge for $k=1,2$. We also review the theory behind the\nquantum-classical correspondence for spin systems, and provide a new numerical\nscheme for quantum state renormalization in 2d using CTs. Our results show that\nbulk information of a lattice system is encoded holographically in\nefficiently-computable properties of its corners.\n", "  We investigate the impact of a fourth sterile neutrino at reactor and\nSpallation Neutron Source neutrino detectors. Specifically, we explore the\ndiscovery potential of the TEXONO and COHERENT experiments to subleading\nsterile neutrino effects through the measurement of the coherent elastic\nneutrino-nucleus scattering event rate. Our dedicated $\\chi^2$-sensitivity\nanalysis employs realistic nuclear structure calculations adequate for high\npurity sub-keV threshold Germanium detectors.\n", "  Acting with non-Abelian T-duality on the $S^3$ inside the $AdS_5$ subspace of\n$AdS_5\\times S^5$ with $N$ units of flux, we generate a new half-BPS solution\nwith $SU(2|4)$ symmetry that belongs to the Lin-Lunin-Maldacena class of\ngeometries. The analysis of the asymptotics, quantised charges and probe branes\nin this geometry suggests an interpretation as the gravity dual to the\nBerenstein-Maldacena-Nastase Plane Wave Matrix Model, in a particular vacuum\nassociated to a partition of $N$, in which the multiplicity of each $SU(2)$\nirreducible representation is equal to its dimension. This vacuum is\ninterpreted in M-theory in terms of giant gravitons backreacting in the\nmaximally supersymmetric pp-wave geometry. Consistently with this, we show that\nthe non-Abelian T-dual solution exactly agrees with the Penrose limit of the\nsuperstar solution in $AdS_7\\times S^4$. This suggests an interesting global\ncompletion of the non-Abelian T-dual solution in terms of an M5-brane geometry.\n", "  Quantum memories matched to single photon sources will form an important\ncornerstone of future quantum network technology. We demonstrate such a memory\nin warm Rb vapor with on-demand storage and retrieval, based on\nelectromagnetically induced transparency. With an acceptance bandwidth of\n$\\delta f$ = 0.66~GHz the memory is suitable for single photons emitted by\nsemiconductor quantum dots. In this regime, vapor cell memories offer an\nexcellent compromise between storage efficiency, storage time, noise level, and\nexperimental complexity, and atomic collisions have negligible influence on the\noptical coherences. Operation of the memory is demonstrated using attenuated\nlaser pulses on the single photon level. For 50 ns storage time we measure\n$\\eta_{\\textrm{e2e}}^{\\textrm{50ns}} = 3.4(3)\\%$ \\emph{end-to-end efficiency}\nof the fiber-coupled memory, with an \\emph{total intrinsic efficiency}\n$\\eta_{\\textrm{int}} = 17(3)\\%$. Straightforward technological improvements can\nboost the end-to-end-efficiency to $\\eta_{\\textrm{e2e}} \\approx 35\\%$; beyond\nthat increasing the optical depth and exploiting the Zeeman substructure of the\natoms will allow such a memory to approach near unity efficiency.\n  In the present memory, the unconditional readout noise level of $9\\cdot\n10^{-3}$ photons is dominated by atomic fluorescence, and for input pulses\ncontaining on average $\\mu_{1}=0.27(4)$ photons the signal to noise level would\nbe unity.\n", "  We investigate electronic excitations in La2-x(Br,Sr)xCuO4 using resonant\ninelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the oxygen K edge. RIXS spectra of the\nhole-doped cuprates show clear momentum dependence below 1 eV. The spectral\nweight exhibits positive dispersion and shifts to higher energy with increasing\nhole concentration. Theoretical calculation of the dynamical charge structure\nfactor on oxygen orbitals in a three-band Hubbard model is consistent with the\nexperimental observation of the momentum and doping dependence, and therefore\nthe dispersive mode is ascribed to intraband charge excitations which have been\nobserved in electron-doped cuprates.\n", "  Thermal fluctuations of nanomagnets driven by spin-polarized currents are\ntreated via the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation as generalized to include both\nthe random thermal noise field and Slonczewski spin-transfer torque terms. The\nmagnetization reversal time of such a nanomagnet is then evaluated for wide\nranges of damping by using a method which generalizes the solution of the\nso-called Kramers turnover problem for mechanical Brownian particles, thereby\nbridging the very low damping and intermediate damping Kramers escape rates, to\nthe analogous magnetic turnover problem. The reversal time is then evaluated\nfor a nanomagnet with the free energy density given in the standard form of\nsuperimposed easy-plane and in-plane easy-axis anisotropies with the dc bias\nfield along the easy axis.\n", "  Direct imaging of exoplanets requires establishing and maintaining a high\ncontrast dark field (DF) within the science image to a high degree of precision\n(10^-10). Current approaches aimed at establishing the DF, such as electric\nfield conjugation (EFC), have been demonstrated in the lab and have proven\ncapable of high contrast DF generation. The same approaches have been\nconsidered for the maintenance of the DF as well. However, these methods rely\non phase diversity measurements which require field modulation; this interrupts\nthe DF and consequently competes with the science acquisition. In this paper,\nwe introduce and demonstrate spatial linear dark field control (LDFC) as an\nalternative technique by which the high contrast DF can be maintained without\nmodulation. Once the DF has been established by conventional EFC, spatial LDFC\nlocks the high contrast state of the DF by operating a closed-loop around the\nlinear response of the bright field (BF) to wavefront variations that modify\nboth the BF and the DF. We describe here the fundamental operating principles\nof spatial LDFC and provide numerical simulations of its operation as a DF\nstabilization technique that is capable of wavefront correction within the DF\nwithout interrupting science acquisition.\n", "  In the present paper, assuming the Multiple Point Principle (MPP) as a new\nlaw of Nature, we considered the existence of the two degenerate vacua of the\nUniverse: a) the first Electroweak (EW) vacuum at $v_1\\approx 246$ GeV -- \"true\nvacuum\", and b) the second Planck scale \"false vacuum\" at $v_2 \\sim 10^{18}$\nGeV. In these vacua we investigated different topological defects. The main aim\nof this paper is an investigation of the black-hole-hedgehogs configurations as\ndefects of the false vacuum. In the framework of the $f(R)$ gravity, described\nby the Gravi-Weak unification model, we considered a black-hole solution, which\ncorresponds to a \"hedgehog\" -- global monopole, that has been \"swallowed\" by\nthe black-hole with mass core $M_{BH}\\sim 10^{18}$ GeV and radius $\\delta\\sim\n10^{-21}$ GeV$^{-1}$. Considering the results of the hedgehog lattice theory in\nthe framework of the $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills gauge-invariant theory with hedgehogs\nin the Wilson loops, we have used the critical value of temperature for the\nhedgehogs confinement phase ($T_c\\sim 10^{18}$ GeV). This result gave us the\npossibility to conclude that the SM shows a new physics (with contributions of\nthe $SU(2)$-triplet Higgs bosons) at the scale $\\sim 10$ TeV. Theory predicts\nthe stability of the EW-vacuum and the accuracy of the MPP.\n", "  We investigate the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in the winds ejected by\naccretion disks formed in neutron star mergers. We compute the element\nformation in disk outflows from hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnants of\nvariable lifetime, including the effect of angular momentum transport in the\ndisk evolution. We employ long-term axisymmetric hydrodynamic disk simulations\nto model the ejecta, and compute r-process nucleosynthesis with tracer\nparticles using a nuclear reaction network containing $\\sim 8000$ species. We\nfind that the previously known strong correlation between HMNS lifetime,\nejected mass, and average electron fraction in the outflow is directly related\nto the amount of neutrino irradiation on the disk, which dominates mass\nejection at early times in the form of a neutrino-driven wind. Production of\nlanthanides and actinides saturates at short HMNS lifetimes ($\\lesssim 10$ ms),\nwith additional ejecta contributing to a blue optical kilonova component for\nlonger-lived HMNSs. We find good agreement between the abundances from the disk\noutflow alone and the solar r-process distribution only for short HMNS\nlifetimes ($\\lesssim 10$ ms). For longer lifetimes, the rare-earth and third\nr-process peaks are significantly under-produced compared to the solar pattern,\nrequiring additional contributions from the dynamical ejecta. The\nnucleosynthesis signature from a spinning black hole (BH) can only overlap with\nthat from a HMNS of moderate lifetime ($\\lesssim 60$ ms). Finally, we show that\nangular momentum transport not only contributes with a late-time outflow\ncomponent, but that it also enhances the neutrino-driven component by moving\nmaterial to shallower regions of the gravitational potential, in addition to\nproviding additional heating.\n", "  We combine Gaia DR1, PS1, SDSS and 2MASS astrometry to measure proper motions\nfor 350 million sources across three-fourths of the sky down to a magnitude of\n$m_r\\sim20$\\,. Using positions of galaxies from PS1, we build a common\nreference frame for the multi-epoch PS1, single-epoch SDSS and 2MASS data, and\ncalibrate the data in small angular patches to this frame. As the Gaia DR1\nexcludes resolved galaxy images, we choose a different approach to calibrate\nits positions to this reference frame: we exploit the fact that the proper\nmotions of stars in these patches are {\\it linear}. By simultaneously fitting\nthe positions of stars at different epochs of -- Gaia DR1, PS1, SDSS, and 2MASS\n-- we construct an extensive catalog of proper motions dubbed GPS1. GPS1 has a\ncharacteristic systematic error of less than 0.3 \\masyr\\, and a typical\nprecision of $ 1.5-2.0$\\masyr. The proper motions have been validated using\ngalaxies, open clusters, distant giant stars and QSOs. In comparison with other\npublished faint proper motion catalogs, GPS1's systematic error ($<0.3$ \\masyr)\nshould be nearly an order of magnitude better than that of PPMXL and UCAC4\n($>2.0$ \\masyr). Similarly, its precision ($\\sim 1.5$ \\masyr) is a four-fold\nimprovement relative to PPMXL and UCAC4 ($\\sim 6.0$ \\masyr). For QSOs, the\nprecision of GPS1 is found to be worse ($\\sim 2.0-3.0$\\masyr), possibly due to\ntheir particular differential chromatic refraction (DCR). The GPS1 catalog will\nbe released on-line and available via the VizieR Service and VO Service.\n(===GPS1 is available with VO TAP Query now, see\nhttp://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/~tian/GPS1/ for details=== )\n", "  Optical tweezers have enabled important insights into intracellular transport\nthrough the investigation of motor proteins, with their ability to manipulate\nparticles at the microscale, affording femto Newton force resolution. Its use\nto realize a constant force clamp has enabled vital insights into the behavior\nof motor proteins under different load conditions. However, the varying nature\nof disturbances and the effect of thermal noise pose key challenges to force\nregulation. Furthermore, often the main aim of many studies is to determine the\nmotion of the motor and the statistics related to the motion, which can be at\nodds with the force regulation objective. In this article, we propose a mixed\nobjective H2-Hinfinity optimization framework using a model-based design, that\nachieves the dual goals of force regulation and real time motion estimation\nwith quantifiable guarantees. Here, we minimize the Hinfinity norm for the\nforce regulation and error in step estimation while maintaining the H2 norm of\nthe noise on step estimate within user specified bounds. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of the framework through extensive simulations and an experimental\nimplementation using an optical tweezer setup with live samples of the motor\nprotein kinesin; where regulation of forces below 1 pico Newton with errors\nbelow 10 percent is obtained while simultaneously providing real time estimates\nof motor motion.\n", "  The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem and its extensions forbid trivial\nphases from arising in certain quantum magnets. Constraining infrared behavior\nwith the ultraviolet data encoded in the microscopic lattice of spins, these\ntheorems tie the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking to the emergence of\nexotic phases like quantum spin liquids. In this work, we take a new\ntopological perspective on these theorems, by arguing they originate from an\nobstruction to \"trivializing\" the lattice under smooth, symmetric deformations,\nwhich we call the \"lattice homotopy problem.\" We conjecture that all LSM-like\ntheorems for quantum magnets (many previously-unknown) can be understood from\nlattice homotopy, which automatically incorporates the full spatial symmetry\ngroup of the lattice, including all its point-group symmetries. One consequence\nis that any spin-symmetric magnet with a half-integer moment on a site with\neven-order rotational symmetry must be a spin liquid. To substantiate the\nclaim, we prove the conjecture in two dimensions for some physically relevant\nsettings.\n", "  We present a magnetic phase diagram of rare-earth pyrochlore\n$\\rm{Yb_2Ti_2O_7}$ in a $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ magnetic field. Using heat\ncapacity, magnetization, and neutron scattering data, we show an unusual\nfield-dependence of a first-order phase boundary, wherein a small applied field\nincreases the ordering temperature. The zero-field ground state has\nferromagnetic domains, while the spins polarize along $\\langle 111 \\rangle$\nabove 0.65T. A classical Monte Carlo analysis of published Hamiltonians does\naccount for the critical field in the low T limit. However, this analysis fails\nto account for the large bulge in the reentrant phase diagram, suggesting that\neither long-range interactions or quantum fluctuations govern low field\nproperties.\n", "  We study the coupling between conventional (Maxwell) and emergent\nelectrodynamics in quantum spin ice, a 3+1-dimensional $U(1)$ quantum spin\nliquid. We find that a uniform electric field can be used to tune the\nproperties of both the ground state and excitations of the spin liquid. In\nparticular, it induces emergent birefringence, rendering the speed of the\nemergent light anisotropic and polarization-dependent. A sufficiently strong\nelectric field triggers a quantum phase transition into new $U(1)$ quantum spin\nliquid phases which trap emergent electric $\\pi$-fluxes. The flux patterns of\nthese new phases depend on the direction of the electric field. Strikingly,\nsome of the canonical pinch points in the spin structure factor, characteristic\nof classical spin ice, emerge near the phase transition, while they are absent\nin the quantum spin liquid phases. Estimating the electric field strength\nrequired, we find that this transition is potentially accessible\nexperimentally. Finally, we propose a minimal mechanism by which an oscillating\nelectric field can generate emergent radiation inside a quantum spin ice\nmaterial with non-Kramers spin doublets.\n", "  We study the problem of initiation of excitation waves in the FitzHugh-Nagumo\nmodel. Our approach follows earlier works and is based on the idea of\napproximating the boundary between basins of attraction of propagating waves\nand of the resting state as the stable manifold of a critical solution. Here,\nwe obtain analytical expressions for the essential ingredients of the theory by\nsingular perturbation using two small parameters, the separation of time scales\nof the activator and inhibitor, and the threshold in the activator's kinetics.\nThis results in a closed analytical expression for the strength-duration curve.\n", "  We explore the feasibility of using fast-slow asymptotic to eliminate the\ncomputational stiffness of the discrete-state, continuous-time deterministic\nMarkov chain models of ionic channels underlying cardiac excitability. We focus\non a Markov chain model of the fast sodium current, and investigate its\nasymptotic behaviour with respect to small parameters identified in different\nways.\n", "  The theory of Hitchin systems is something like a \"global theory of Lie\ngroups\", where one works over a Riemann surface rather than just at a point.\nWe'll describe how one can take this analogy a few steps further by attempting\nto make precise the class of rich geometric objects that appear in this story\n(including the non-compact case), and discuss their classification, outlining a\ntheory of \"Dynkin diagrams\" as a step towards classifying some examples of such\nobjects.\n", "  In conventional insulating magnets, heat is carried by magnons and phonons.\nIn contrast, when the magnets harbor a quantum spin liquid state, emergent\nquasiparticles from the fractionalization of quantum spins can carry heat.\nHere, we investigate unconventional thermal transport yielded by such exotic\ncarriers, in both longitudinal and transverse components, for the Kitaev model,\nwhose ground state is exactly shown to be a quantum spin liquid with fractional\nexcitations described as itinerant Majorana fermions and localized $Z_2$\nfluxes. We find that the longitudinal thermal conductivity exhibits a broad\npeak at very different temperatures between the zero and nonzero frequency\ncomponents, reflecting the spin fractionalization. On the other hand, the\ntransverse thermal conductivity induced by the magnetic field shows\nnonmonotonic temperature dependence, due to thermal excitations of the\nlocalized $Z_2$ fluxes. In the low-temperature limit, the temperature-linear\ncoefficient rapidly approaches a quantized value, as expected from the\ntopologically nontrivial nature of itinerant Majorana fermions. The\ncharacteristic behaviors provide experimentally-accessible evidences of\nfractional excitations in the proximity to Kitaev quantum spin liquid.\n", "  We derive third order transport coefficients of skewness for a phase-space\nkinetic model that considers the processes of scattering collisions, trapping,\ndetrapping and recombination losses. The resulting expression for the skewness\ntensor provides an extension to Fick's law which is in turn applied to yield a\ncorresponding generalised advection-diffusion-skewness equation. A physical\ninterpretation of trap-induced skewness is presented and used to describe an\nobserved negative skewness due to traps. A relationship between skewness,\ndiffusion, mobility and temperature is formed by analogy with Einstein's\nrelation. Fractional transport is explored and its effects on the flux\ntransport coefficients are also outlined.\n", "  Continuous gravitational waves from neutron stars could provide an invaluable\nresource to learn about their interior physics. A common search method involves\nmatched filtering a modeled template against the noisy gravitational-wave data\nto find signals. This method suffers a mismatch (i.e., relative loss of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio) if the signal deviates from the template. One possible\ninstance in which this may occur is if the neutron star undergoes a glitch, a\nsudden rapid increase in the rotation frequency seen in the timing of many\nradio pulsars. In this work, we use a statistical characterization of the\nglitch rate and size in radio pulsars to estimate how often neutron star\nglitches would occur within the parameter space of continuous\ngravitational-wave searches and how much mismatch putative signals would suffer\nin the search due to these glitches. We find that for many previous and\npotential future searches continuous-wave signals have an elevated probability\nof undergoing one or more glitches and that these glitches will often lead to a\nsubstantial fraction of the signal-to-noise ratio being lost. This could lead\nto a failure to identify candidate gravitational-wave signals in the initial\nstages of a search and also to the false dismissal of candidates in subsequent\nfollow-up stages.\n", "  Rydberg atoms have attracted considerable interest due to their huge\ninteraction among each other and with external fields. They demonstrate\ncharacteristic scaling laws in dependence on the principal quantum number $n$\nfor features such as the magnetic field for level crossing. While bearing\nstriking similarities to Rydberg atoms, fundamentally new insights may be\nobtained for Rydberg excitons, as the crystal environment gives easy optical\naccess to many states within an exciton multiplet. Here we study experimentally\nand theoretically the scaling of several characteristic parameters of Rydberg\nexcitons with $n$. From absorption spectra in magnetic field we find for the\nfirst crossing of levels with adjacent principal quantum numbers a $B_r \\propto\nn^{-4}$ dependence of the resonance field strength, $B_r$, due to the dominant\nparamagnetic term unlike in the atomic case where the diamagnetic contribution\nis decisive. By contrast, in electric field we find scaling laws just like for\nRydberg atoms. The resonance electric field strength scales as $E_r \\propto\nn^{-5}$. We observe anticrossings of the states belonging to multiplets with\ndifferent principal quantum numbers. The energy splittings at the avoided\ncrossings scale as $n^{-4}$ which we relate to the crystal specific deviation\nof the exciton Hamiltonian from the hydrogen model. We observe the exciton\npolarizability in the electric field to scale as $n^7$. In magnetic field the\ncrossover field strength from a hydrogen-like exciton to a magnetoexciton\ndominated by electron and hole Landau level quantization scales as $n^{-3}$.\nThe ionization voltages demonstrate a $n^{-4}$ scaling as for atoms. The width\nof the absorption lines remains constant before dissociation for high enough\n$n$, while for small $n \\lesssim 12$ an exponential increase with the field is\nfound. These results are in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations.\n", "  The composite fermion (CF) formalism produces wave functions that are not\nalways linearly independent. This is especially so in the low angular momentum\nregime in the lowest Landau level, where a subclass of CF states, known as\nsimple states, gives a good description of the low energy spectrum. For the\ntwo-component Bose gas, explicit bases avoiding the large number of redundant\nstates have been found. We generalize one of these bases to the $M$-component\nBose gas and prove its validity. We also show that the numbers of linearly\nindependent simple states for different values of angular momentum are given by\ncoefficients of $q$-multinomials.\n", "  In this study we refine a CME model presented in an earlier study on the\nglobal energetics of solar flares and associated CMEs, and apply it to all\n(860) GOES M- and X-class flare events observed during the first 7 years\n(2010-2016) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission, which doubles the\nstatistics of the earlier study. The model refinements include: (1) the CME\ngeometry in terms of a 3D sphere undergoing self-similar adiabatic expansion;\n(2) the inclusion of solar gravitational deceleration during the acceleration\nand propagation of the CME, which discriminates eruptive and confined CMEs; (4)\na self-consistent relationship between the CME center-of-mass motion detected\nduring EUV dimming and the leading-edge motion observed in white-light\ncoronagraphs; (5) the equi-partition of the CME kinetic and thermal energy; and\n(6) the Rosner-Tucker-Vaiana (RTV) scaling law. The refined CME model is\nentirely based on EUV dimming observations (using AIA/SDO data) and complements\nthe traditional white-light scattering model (using LASCO/SOHO data), and both\nmodels are independently capable to determine fundamental CME parameters such\nas the CME mass, speed, and energy. Comparing the two methods we find that: (1)\nLASCO is less sensitive than AIA in detecting CMEs (in 24$\\%$ of the cases);\n(2) CME masses below $m_{cme} \\sim 10^{14}$ g are under-estimated by LASCO; (3)\nAIA and LASCO masses, speeds, and energy agree closely in the statistical mean\nafter elimination of outliers; (4) the CMEs parameters of the speed $v$,\nemission measure-weighted flare peak temperature $T_e$, and length scale $L$\nare consistent with the following scaling laws (derived from first principles):\n$v \\propto T_e^{1/2}$, $v \\propto (m_{cme})^{1/4}$, and $m_{cme} \\propto L^2$.\n", "  In this paper we present the co-simulation of a PID class power converter\ncontroller and an electrical circuit by means of the waveform relaxation\ntechnique. The simulation of the controller model is characterized by a\nfixed-time stepping scheme reflecting its digital implementation, whereas a\ncircuit simulation usually employs an adaptive time stepping scheme in order to\naccount for a wide range of time constants within the circuit model. In order\nto maintain the characteristic of both models as well as to facilitate model\nreplacement, we treat them separately by means of input/output relations and\npropose an application of a waveform relaxation algorithm. Furthermore, the\nmaximum and minimum number of iterations of the proposed algorithm are\nmathematically analyzed. The concept of controller/circuit coupling is\nillustrated by an example of the co-simulation of a PI power converter\ncontroller and a model of the main dipole circuit of the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  We propose a quantum simulation of the quantum Rabi model in an atomic\nquantum dot, which is a single atom in a tight optical trap coupled to the\nquasiparticle modes of a superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate. This widely\ntunable setup allows to simulate the ultrastrong coupling regime of\nlight-matter interaction in a system which enjoys an amenable characteristic\ntimescale, paving the way for an experimental analysis of the transition\nbetween the Jaynes-Cummings and the quantum Rabi dynamics using cold-atom\nsystems. Our scheme can be naturally extended to simulate multi-qubit quantum\nRabi models. In particular, we discuss the appearance of effective two-qubit\ninteractions due to phononic exchange, among other features.\n", "  We consider a disordered graphene layer with anisotropic Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling subjected to a longitudinal electric field. Using the linear response\ntheory we calculate current-induced spin polarization including in-plane normal\nand parallel components with respect to the electric field direction. Unlike\nthe case of isotropic Rashba spin-orbit where the normal component of spin\npolarization is linear in terms of Fermi energy around the Dirac point,\nanisotropic Rashba spin-orbit can result in non-linear dependence of this\ncomponent at such energies within the Lifshitz points. Furthermore, we show\nthat anisotropic Rashba interaction allows for tuning the direction of spin\npolarization from perpendicular direction to the parallel one such that for\ncertain values of Rashba parameters the magnitudes of both components can also\nbe quenched. The effect of carriers scattering on randomly distributed\nnon-magnetic disorders is also taken into account by calculating vertex\ncorrection. This results in modification of spin polarization components\ndepending on the relative strength of Rashba parameters.\n", "  We report a new internal gauge symmetry of the n-dimensional Palatini action\nwith cosmological term (n>3) that is the generalization of three-dimensional\nlocal translations. This symmetry is obtained through the direct application of\nthe converse of Noether's second theorem on the theory under consideration. We\nshow that diffeomorphisms can be expressed as linear combinations of it and\nlocal Lorentz transformations with field-dependent parameters up to terms\ninvolving the variational derivatives of the action. As a result, the new\ninternal symmetry together with local Lorentz transformations can be adopted as\nthe fundamental gauge symmetries of general relativity. Although their gauge\nalgebra is open in general, it allows us to recover, without resorting to the\nequations of motion, the very well-known Lie algebra satisfied by translations\nand Lorentz transformations in three dimensions. We also report the analog of\nthe new gauge symmetry for the Holst action with cosmological term, finding\nthat it explicitly depends on the Immirzi parameter. The same result concerning\nits relation to diffeomorphisms and the open character of the gauge algebra\nalso hold in this case. Finally, we consider the non-minimal coupling of a\nscalar field to gravity in n dimensions and establish that the new gauge\nsymmetry is affected by this matter field. Our results indicate that general\nrelativity in dimension greater than three can be thought of as a gauge theory.\n", "  During their first observational run, the two Advanced LIGO detectors\nattained an unprecedented sensitivity, resulting in the first direct detections\nof gravitational-wave signals and GW151226, produced by stellar-mass binary\nblack hole systems. This paper reports on an all-sky search for gravitational\nwaves (GWs) from merging intermediate mass black hole binaries (IMBHBs). The\ncombined results from two independent search techniques were used in this\nstudy: the first employs a matched-filter algorithm that uses a bank of filters\ncovering the GW signal parameter space, while the second is a generic search\nfor GW transients (bursts). No GWs from IMBHBs were detected, therefore, we\nconstrain the rate of several classes of IMBHB mergers. The most stringent\nlimit is obtained for black holes of individual mass $100\\,M_\\odot$, with spins\naligned with the binary orbital angular momentum. For such systems, the merger\nrate is constrained to be less than $0.93~\\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\\,yr}^{-1}$ in\ncomoving units at the $90\\%$ confidence level, an improvement of nearly 2\norders of magnitude over previous upper limits.\n", "  We review recent progress in studies of nuclear final-state interactions in\ndeep inelastic scattering (DIS) off the lightest nuclei tagged by a recoil\nnucleon. These processes hold a lot of potential for resolving the outstanding\nissues related to the dynamics of hadronization in QCD. Within the minimal Fock\ncomponent framework, valid at large Bjorken $x$, the main features of the\ntheoretical approach based on the virtual nucleon approximation are elaborated.\nIn this approach, the strong final-state interaction of the DIS products with\nthe nuclear fragments is described by an effective eikonal amplitude, whose\nparameters can be extracted from the analysis of semi-inclusive DIS off the\ndeuteron target. The extraction of the $Q^2$ and $W$ mass dependences of these\nparameters gives a new observable in studying the QCD structure of DIS final\nstates. Another important feature of tagged DIS off the lightest nuclei is the\npossibility of performing pole extrapolation with a high degree of accuracy.\nSuch extrapolation allows an extraction of the neutron structure function in a\nmodel independent way due to suppression of the final-state interaction in the\non-shell limit of the struck nucleon propagator. We review the first\napplication of the pole extrapolation to recent experimental data. Finally, we\noutline the extension of the framework to inclusive DIS, including a polarized\ndeuteron target as well as its application to the tagged DIS reactions for\nfuture experiments at fixed target and collider energies.\n", "  In this paper we study the combinatorics of quasi-trigonometric solutions of\nthe classical Yang-Baxter equation, arising from simple vector bundles on a\nnodal Weierstrass cubic.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of protecting the state of a quantum system that\ngoes through noise by measurements and operations before and after the noise\nprocess. We extend our previous result on nonexistence of \"truly quantum\"\nprotocols that protect an unknown qubit state against the depolarizing noise\nbetter than \"classical\" ones [Phys. Rev. A, 95, 022321 (2017)] in two\ndirections. First, we show that the statement is also true in any\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, which was previously conjectured, the\noptimal protocol is either the do nothing protocol or the discriminate and\nreprepare protocol, depending on the strength of the noise. Second, in the case\nof a qubit, we show that essentially the same conclusion holds for any unital\nnoise. These results describe the fundamental limitations in quantum mechanics\nfrom the viewpoint of control theory.\n", "  The two-dimensional character and reduced screening in monolayer\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) lead to the ubiquitous formation of\nrobust excitons with binding energies orders of magnitude larger than in bulk\nsemiconductors. Focusing on neutral excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, that\ndominate the optical response in TMDs, it is shown that they can provide\nfingerprints for magnetic proximity effects in magnetic heterostructures. These\nproximity effects cannot be described by the widely used single-particle\ndescription, but instead reveal the possibility of a conversion between\noptically inactive and active excitons by rotating the magnetization of the\nmagnetic substrate. With recent breakthroughs in fabricating Mo- and W-based\nmagnetic TMD-heterostructures, this emergent optical response can be directly\ntested experimentally.\n", "  In various situations where wave transport is preeminent, like in wireless\ncommunication, a strong established transmission is present in a complex\nscattering environment. We develop a novel approach to describe emerging\nfluctuations, which combines a transmitting channel and a chaotic background in\na unified effective Hamiltonian. Modeling such a background by random matrix\ntheory, we derive exact non-perturbative results for both transmission and\nreflection distributions at arbitrary absorption that is typically present in\nreal systems. Remarkably, in such a complex scattering situation, the transport\nis governed by only two parameters: an absorption rate and the ratio of the\nso-called spreading width to the natural width of the transmission line. In\nparticular, we find that the established transmission disappears sharply when\nthis ratio exceeds unity. The approach exemplifies the role of the chaotic\nbackground in dephasing the deterministic scattering.\n", "  Weak lensing convergence statistics is a powerful tool to probe dark energy.\nDark energy plays an important role to the structure formation and the effects\ncan be detected through the convergence power spectrum, bi-spectrum etc. One of\nthe most promising and simplest dark energy model is the $ \\Lambda $CDM.\nHowever, it is worth investigating different dark energy models with evolving\nequation of state of the dark energy. In this work, detectability of different\ndark energy models from $ \\Lambda $CDM model has been explored through\nconvergence power spectrum and bi-spectrum.\n", "  I present a simple phenomenological model for the observed linear scaling of\nthe stellar mass in old globular clusters (GCs) with $z=0$ halo mass in which\nthe stellar mass in GCs scales linearly with progenitor halo mass at $z=6$\nabove a minimum halo mass for GC formation. This model reproduces the observed\n$M_{\\rm GCs}-M_{\\rm halo}$ relation at $z=0$ and results in a prediction for\nthe minimum halo mass at $z=6$ required for hosting one GC: $M_{\\rm\nmin}(z=6)=1.07 \\times 10^9\\,M_{\\odot}$. Translated to $z=0$, the mean threshold\nmass is $M_{\\rm halo}(z=0) \\approx 2\\times 10^{10}\\,M_{\\odot}$. I explore the\nobservability of GCs in the reionization era and their contribution to cosmic\nreionization, both of which depend sensitively on the (unknown) ratio of GC\nbirth mass to present-day stellar mass, $\\xi$. Based on current detections of\n$z \\gtrsim 6$ objects with $M_{1500} < -17$, values of $\\xi > 10$ are strongly\ndisfavored; this, in turn, has potentially important implications for GC\nformation scenarios. Even for low values of $\\xi$, some observed high-$z$\ngalaxies may actually be GCs, complicating estimates of reionization-era galaxy\nultraviolet luminosity functions and constraints on dark matter models. GCs are\nlikely important reionization sources if $5 \\lesssim \\xi \\lesssim 10$. I also\nexplore predictions for the fraction of accreted versus in situ GCs in the\nlocal Universe and for descendants of systems at the halo mass threshold of GC\nformation (dwarf galaxies). An appealing feature of the model presented here is\nthe ability to make predictions for GC properties based solely on dark matter\nhalo merger trees.\n", "  The cointercalation of sodium with the solvent organic molecule into graphite\ncan resolve difficulty of forming the stage-I Na-graphite intercalation\ncompound, which is a predominant anode of Na-ion battery. To clarify the\nmechanism of such cointercalation, we investigate the atomistic structure,\nenergetics, electrochemical properties, ion and electron conductance, and\ncharge transferring upon de/intercalation of the solvated Na-diglyme ion into\ngraphite with {\\it ab initio} calculations. It is found that the\nNa(digl)$_2$C$_n$ compound has the negatively lowest intercalation energy at\n$n\\approx$21, the solvated Na(digl)$_2$ ion diffuses fast in the interlayer\nspace, and their electronic conductance can be enhanced compared to graphite.\nThe calculations reveal that the diglyme molecules as well as Na atom donates\nelectrons to the graphene layer, resulting in the formation of ionic bonding\nbetween the graphene layer and the moiety of diglyme molecule. This work will\ncontribute to the development of innovative anode materials for alkali-ion\nbattery applications.\n", "  The Bose-Einstein condensation of $\\alpha$ partciles in the multicomponent\nenvironment of dilute, warm nuclear matter is studied. We consider the cases of\nmatter composed of light clusters with mass numbers $A\\leq 4$ and matter that\nin addition these clusters contains $\\isotope[56]{Fe}$ nuclei. We apply the\nquasiparticle gas model which treats clusters as bound states with infinite\nlife-time and binding energies independent of temperature and density. We show\nthat the $\\alpha$ particles can form a condensate at low temperature $T\\le 2$\nMeV in such matter in the first case. When the $\\isotope[56]{Fe}$ nucleus is\nadded to the composition the cluster abundances are strongly modified at low\ntemperatures, with an important implication that the $\\alpha$ condensation at\nthese temperatures is suppressed.\n", "  Small bodies of the Solar system, like asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects,\ncometary nuclei, planetary satellites, with diameters smaller than one thousand\nkilometers usually have irregular shapes, often resembling dumb-bells, or\ncontact binaries. The spinning of such a gravitating dumb-bell creates around\nit a zone of chaotic orbits. We determine its extent analytically and\nnumerically. We find that the chaotic zone swells significantly if the rotation\nrate is decreased, in particular, the zone swells more than twice if the\nrotation rate is decreased ten times with respect to the \"centrifugal breakup\"\nthreshold. We illustrate the properties of the chaotic orbital zones in\nexamples of the global orbital dynamics about asteroid 243 Ida (which has a\nmoon, Dactyl, orbiting near the edge of the chaotic zone) and asteroid 25143\nItokawa.\n", "  The recent discovery of excellent thermoelectric properties and topological\nsurface states in SnTe-based compounds has attracted extensive attention in\nvarious research areas. Indium doped SnTe is of particular interest because,\ndepending on the doping level, it can either generate resonant states in the\nbulk valence band leading to enhanced thermoelectric properties, or induce\nsuperconductivity that coexists with topological states. Here we report on the\nvapor deposition of In-doped SnTe nanowires and the study of their surface\noxidation and thermoelectric properties. The nanowire growth is assisted by Au\ncatalysts, and their morphologies vary as a function of substrate position and\ntemperature. Transmission electron microscopy characterization reveals the\nformation of amorphous surface in single crystalline nanowires. X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy studies suggest that the nanowire surface is\ncomposed of In2O3, SnO2, Te and TeO2 which can be readily removed by argon ion\nsputtering. Exposure of the cleaned nanowires to atmosphere yields rapid\noxidation of the surface within only one minute. Characterizations of\nelectrical conductivity {\\sigma}, thermopower S, and thermal conductivity\n\\k{appa} were performed on the same In-doped nanowire which shows suppressed\n{\\sigma} and \\k{appa} but enhanced S yielding an improved thermoelectric figure\nof merit ZT than the undoped SnTe.\n", "  We determine the motion of a charge (hole or electron) added to the Mott\ninsulating, antiferromagnetic (AF) ground-state of quasi-2D iridates such as Ba\n2 IrO 4 or Sr 2 IrO 4 . We show that correlation effects, calculated within the\nself-consistent Born approximation, render the hole and electron case very\ndifferent. An added electron forms a spin-polaron, which closely resembles the\nwell-known cuprates, but the situation of a removed electron is far more\ncomplex. Many-body 5d 4 configurations form which can be singlet and triplets\nof total angular momentum J and strongly affect the hole motion between AF\nsublattices. This not only has important ramifications for the interpretation\nof (inverse-)photoemission experiments of quasi-2D iridates but also\ndemonstrates that the correlation physics in electron- and hole-doped iridates\nis fundamentally different.\n", "  We develop a numerical model to study the time-dependent modulation of\ngalactic cosmic rays (GCRs) in the inner heliosphere. In the model a\ntime-delayed modified Parker heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) and a new\ndiffusion coefficient model, NLGCE-F, from Qin \\& Zhang (2014), are adopted. In\naddition, the latitudinal dependence of magnetic turbulence magnitude is\nassumed as $\\sim (1+\\sin^2\\theta)/2$ from the observations of Ulysses, and the\nradial dependence is assumed as $\\sim r^S$, where we choose an expression of\n$S$ as a function of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) tilt angle. We show\nthat the analytical expression used to describe the spatial variation of HMF\nturbulence magnitude agrees well with the Ulysses, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2\nobservations. By numerically calculating the modulation code we get the proton\nenergy spectra as a function of time during the recent solar minimum, it is\nshown that the modulation results are consistent with the PAMELA measurements.\n", "  Atomically thin circuits have recently been explored for applications in\nnext-generation electronics and optoelectronics and have been demonstrated with\ntwo-dimensional lateral heterojunctions. In order to form true 2D circuitry\nfrom a single material, electronic properties must be spatially tunable. Here,\nwe report tunable transport behavior which was introduced into single layer\ntungsten diselenide and tungsten disulfide by focused He$^+$ irradiation.\nPseudo-metallic behavior was induced by irradiating the materials with a dose\nof ~1x10$^{16} He^+/cm^2$ to introduce defect states, and subsequent\ntemperature-dependent transport measurements suggest a nearest neighbor hopping\nmechanism is operative. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron\nenergy loss spectroscopy reveal that Se is sputtered preferentially, and\nextended percolating networks of edge states form within WSe$_2$ at a critical\ndose of 1x10$^{16} He^+/cm^2$. First-principles calculations confirm the\nsemiconductor-to-metallic transition of WSe$_2$ after pore and edge defects\nwere introduced by He$^+$ irradiation. The hopping conduction was utilized to\ndirect-write resistor loaded logic circuits in WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ with a\nvoltage gain of greater than 5. Edge contacted thin film transistors were also\nfabricated with a high on/off ratio (> 10$^6$), demonstrating potential for the\nformation of atomically thin circuits.\n", "  We show that the Active-Day-Fraction calibration method (Willamo et al.\n[2017]) fails for Gustav Sp\\\"orer's sunspot group observations. Sp\\\"orer was\nlabeled a 'perfect observer' on account of his 'observational threshold SS\narea' being determined to be equal to zero, based on the assumption that the\nobserver can see and report all the groups with the area larger than SS, while\nmissing all smaller groups. So, Sp\\\"orer could apparently, according to the ADF\ncalibration method, see and report all groups, regardless of size and should\nnever miss any. This suggests a very direct test: compute the yearly average\ngroup count for both Sp\\\"orer and the 'perfect observer' exemplar, the Royal\nGreenwich Observatory (RGO), and compare them. They should be identical within\na reasonable (very small) error margin. We find that they are not and that RGO\ngenerally reported 45% more groups than Sp\\\"orer, and that therefore, the\nADF-method is not generally applicable\n", "  We present the perturbative renormalization group functions of\n$O(n)$-symmetric $\\phi^4$ theory in $4-2\\varepsilon$ dimensions to the sixth\nloop order in the minimal subtraction scheme. In addition, we estimate diagrams\nwithout subdivergences up to 11 loops and compare these results with the\nasymptotic behaviour of the beta function. Furthermore, we perform a\nresummation to obtain estimates for critical exponents in three and two\ndimensions.\n", "  We present a \\asnmr Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and resistivity study of\nthe effect of 5.5 MeV proton irradiation on the optimal electron doped ($x=$\n0.068) and overdoped ($x=$ 0.107) Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ iron based\nsuperconductors. While the proton induced defects only mildly suppress the\ncritical temperature and increase residual resistivity in both compositions,\nsizable broadening of the NMR spectra was observed in all the irradiated\nsamples at low temperature. The effect is significantly stronger in the\noptimally doped sample where the Curie Weiss temperature dependence of the line\nwidth suggests the onset of ferromagnetic correlations coexisting with\nsuperconductivity at the nanoscale. 1/T$_2$ measurements revealed that the\nenergy barrier characterizing the low energy spin fluctuations of these\ncompounds is enhanced upon proton irradiation, suggesting that the defects are\nlikely slowing down the fluctuations between ($0,\\pi)$ and ($\\pi$,0) nematic\nground states.\n", "  The current exoplanet database includes 5454 confirmed planets and candidate\nplanets observed with the KEPLER mission. We find 932 planet pairs from which\nwe extract distance and orbital period ratios. While earlier studies used the\nTitius-Bode law or a generalized version with logarithmic spacing, which both\nlack a physical model, we employ here the theory of harmonic orbit resonances,\nwhich contains quantized ratios instead, to explain the observed planet\ndistance ratios and to predict undetected exoplanets. We find that the most\nprevailing harmonic ratios are (2:1), (3:2), and (5:3), in 73\\% of the cases,\nwhile alternative harmonic ratios of (5:4), (4:3), (5:2), (3:1) occur in 27\\%\nof the other cases. Our orbital predictions includes 171 exoplanets, 2 Jupiter\nmoons, one Saturn moon, 3 Uranus moons, and 4 Neptune moons. The accuracy of\nthe predicted planet distances amounts to a few percent, which fits the data\nsignificantly better than the Titius-Bode law or a logarithmic spacing. This\ninformation may be useful for targeted exoplanet searches with Kepler data and\nto estimate the number of live-carrying planets in habitable zones.\n", "  We study the relative entanglement entropy (EE) among various primary excited\nstates in two critical spin chains: the S=1/2 XXZ chain and the transverse\nfield Ising chain at criticality. For the S=1/2 XXZ chain, which corresponds to\nc=1 free boson conformal field theory (CFT), we numerically calculate the\nrelative EE by exact diagonalization and find a perfect agreement with the\npredictions by the CFT. For the transverse field Ising chain at criticality,\nwhich corresponds to the c=1/2 Ising CFT, we analytically relate its relative\nEE to that of the S=1/2 XXZ chain and confirm the relation numerically. We also\ncalculate the \"sandwiched\" R\\'enyi relative EE and again the numerical results\nagree well with the analytical predictions. Our results are the first direct\nconfirmation of the CFT predictions on the relative EE of the primary excited\nstates in critical spin chains.\n", "  Diffusion in a two-species 2D system has been simulated using a lattice\napproach. Rodlike particles were considered as linear $k$-mers of two mutually\nperpendicular orientations ($k_x$- and $k_y$-mers) on a square lattice. These\n$k_x$- and $k_y$-mers were treated as species of two kinds. A random sequential\nadsorption model was used to produce an initial homogeneous distribution of\n$k$-mers. The concentration of $k$-mers, $p$, was varied in the range from 0.1\nto the jamming concentration, $p_j$. By means of the Monte Carlo technique,\ntranslational diffusion of the $k$-mers was simulated as a random walk, while\nrotational diffusion was ignored. We demonstrated that the diffusion\ncoefficients are strongly anisotropic and nonlinearly concentration-dependent.\nFor sufficiently large concentrations (packing densities) and $k \\geq 6$, the\nsystem tends toward a well-organized steady state. Boundary conditions (BC)\npredetermine the final state of the system. When periodic BCs are applied along\nboth directions of the square lattice, the system tends to a steady state in\nthe form of diagonal stripes. The formation of stripe domains takes longer time\nthe larger the lattice size, and is observed only for concentrations above a\nparticular critical value. When insulating (zero flux) BCs are applied along\nboth directions of the square lattice, each kind of $k$-mer tries to completely\noccupy a half of the lattice divided by a diagonal, e.g., $k_x$-mers locate in\nthe upper left corner, while the $k_y$-mers are situated in the lower right\ncorner (\"yin-yang\" pattern). From time to time, regions built of $k_x$- and\n$k_y$-mers exchange their locations through irregular patterns. When mixed BCs\nare used (periodic BCs are applied along one direction whereas insulating BCs\nare applied along the other one), the system still tends to form the stripes,\nbut they are unstable and change their spatial orientation.\n", "  We study a system consisting of a Luttinger liquid coupled to a quantum dot\non the boundary. The Luttinger liquid is expressed in terms of fermions\ninteracting via density-density coupling and the dot is modeled as an\ninteracting resonant level on to which the bulk fermions can tunnel. We solve\nthe Hamiltonian exactly and construct all eigenstates. We study both the zero\nand finite temperature properties of the system, in particular we compute the\nexact dot occupation as a function of the dot energy in all parameter regimes.\nThe system is seen to flow from weak to to strong coupling for all values of\nthe bulk interaction, with the flow characterized by a non-perturbative Kondo\nscale. We identify the critical exponents at the weak and strong coupling\nregimes.\n", "  Motivated by the modeling of the temporal structure of the velocity field in\na highly turbulent flow, we propose and study a linear stochastic differential\nequation that involves the ingredients of a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,\nsupplemented by a fractional Gaussian noise, of parameter $H$, regularized over\na (small) time scale $\\epsilon>0$. A peculiar correlation between these two\nplays a key role in the establishment of the statistical properties of its\nsolution. We show that this solution reaches a stationary regime, which\nmarginals, including variance and increment variance, remain bounded when\n$\\epsilon \\to 0$. In particular, in this limit, for any $H\\in ]0,1[$, we show\nthat the increment variance behaves at small scales as the one of a fractional\nBrownian motion of same parameter $H$. From the theoretical side, this approach\nappears especially well suited to deal with the (very) rough case $H<1/2$,\nincluding the boundary value $H=0$, and to design simple and efficient\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  We derive L\\\"{u}scher phaseshift formulas for two-particle states in boxes\nelongated in one of the dimensions. Such boxes offer a cost-effective way of\nvarying the relative momentum of the particles. Boosted states in the elongated\ndirection, which allow wider access to energies, are also considered. The\nformulas for the various scenarios (moving and zero-momentum states in cubic\nand elongated boxes) are compared and relations between them are clarified. The\nresults are applicable to a wide set of meson-meson and meson-baryon elastic\nscattering processes, with the two-particle system having equal or unequal\nmasses.\n", "  The formation of the first stars in the high-redshift Universe is a sensitive\nprobe of the small-scale, particle physics nature of dark matter (DM). We carry\nout cosmological simulations of primordial star formation in ultra-light,\naxion-like particle DM cosmology, with masses of $10^{-22}$ and $10^{-21}\\,{\\rm\neV}$, with de Broglie wavelengths approaching galactic scales ($\\sim$kpc). The\nonset of star formation is delayed, and shifted to more massive host\nstructures. For the lightest DM particle mass explored here, first stars form\nat $z \\sim 7$ in structures with $\\sim 10^9\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$, compared to the\nstandard minihalo environment within the $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter\n($\\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, where $z \\sim 20 - 30$ and $\\sim 10^5 - 10^6\\,{\\rm\nM}_\\odot$. Despite this greatly altered DM host environment, the thermodynamic\nbehaviour of the metal-free gas as it collapses into the DM potential well\nasymptotically approaches a very similar evolutionary track. Thus, the\nfragmentation properties are predicted to remain the same as in $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology, implying a similar mass scale for the first stars. These results\npredict intense starbursts in the axion cosmologies, which may be amenable to\nobservations with the {\\it James Webb Space Telescope}.\n", "  We identify several pairs of 'equivalent' observers defined as observers with\nequal or nearly equal 'observational threshold' areas of sunspots on the solar\ndisk as determined by the 'Active Days Fraction' method [e.g. Willamo et al.,\n2017]. For such pairs of observers, the ADF-method would be expected to map the\nactually observed sunspot group numbers for the individual observers to two\nreconstructed series that are very nearly equal and (it is claimed) represent\n'real' solar activity without arbitrary choices and deleterious,\nerror-accumulating 'daisy-chaining'. We show that this goal has not been\nachieved (for the critical period at the end of the 19th century and the\nbeginning of the 20th), rendering the ADF-methodology suspect and not reliable\nnor useful for studying the long-term variation of solar activity.\n", "  Multicomponent density functional theory (DFT) enables the consistent quantum\nmechanical treatment of both electrons and protons. A major challenge has been\nthe design of electron-proton correlation functionals that produce even\nqualitatively accurate proton densities. Herein an electron-proton correlation\nfunctional, epc17, is derived analogously to the Colle-Salvetti formalism for\nelectron correlation and is implemented within the nuclear-electronic orbital\n(NEO) framework. The NEO-DFT/epc17 method produces accurate proton densities\nefficiently and is promising for diverse applications.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to determine lost works in a molecular engine and\ncompare results with macro (classical) heat engines. Firstly, irreversible\nthermodynamics are reviewed for macro and molecular cycles. Secondly,\nirreversible thermodynamics approaches are applied for a quantum heat engine\nwith -1/2 spin system. Finally, lost works are determined for considered system\nand results show that macro and molecular heat engines obey same limitations.\nMoreover, a quantum thermodynamic approach is suggested in order to explain the\nresults previously obtained from an atomic viewpoint.\n", "  The interplay between magnetism and topology, as exemplified in the magnetic\nskyrmion systems, has emerged as a rich playground for finding novel quantum\nphenomena and applications in future information technology. Magnetic\ntopological insulators (TI) have attracted much recent attention, especially\nafter the experimental realization of quantum anomalous Hall effect. Future\napplications of magnetic TI hinge on the accurate manipulation of magnetism and\ntopology by external perturbations, preferably with a gate electric field. In\nthis work, we investigate the magneto transport properties of Cr doped\nBi2(SexTe1-x)3 TI across the topological quantum critical point (QCP). We find\nthat the external gate voltage has negligible effect on the magnetic order for\nsamples far away from the topological QCP. But for the sample near the QCP, we\nobserve a ferromagnetic (FM) to paramagnetic (PM) phase transition driven by\nthe gate electric field. Theoretical calculations show that a perpendicular\nelectric field causes a shift of electronic energy levels due to the Stark\neffect, which induces a topological quantum phase transition and consequently a\nmagnetic phase transition. The in situ electrical control of the topological\nand magnetic properties of TI shed important new lights on future topological\nelectronic or spintronic device applications.\n", "  We discuss effects of loss of coherence in low energy quantum systems caused\nby or related to gravitation, referred to as gravitational decoherence. These\neffects, resulting from random metric fluctuations, for instance, promise to be\naccessible by relatively inexpensive table-top experiments, way before the\nscales where true quantum gravity effects become important. Therefore, they can\nprovide a first experimental view on gravity in the quantum regime. We will\nsurvey models of decoherence induced both by classical and quantum\ngravitational fluctuations; it will be manifest that a clear understanding of\ngravitational decoherence is still lacking. Next we will review models where\nquantum theory is modified, under the assumption that gravity causes the\ncollapse of the wave functions, when systems are large enough. These models\nchallenge the quantum-gravity interplay, and can be tested experimentally. In\nthe last part we have a look at the state of the art of experimental research.\nWe will review efforts aiming at more and more accurate measurements of gravity\n(G and g) and ideas for measuring conventional and unconventional gravity\neffects on nonrelativistic quantum systems.\n", "  In diffusion MRI (dMRI), a good sampling scheme is important for efficient\nacquisition and robust reconstruction. Diffusion weighted signal is normally\nacquired on single or multiple shells in q-space. Signal samples are typically\ndistributed uniformly on different shells to make them invariant to the\norientation of structures within tissue, or the laboratory coordinate frame.\nThe Electrostatic Energy Minimization (EEM) method, originally proposed for\nsingle shell sampling scheme in dMRI, was recently generalized to multi-shell\nschemes, called Generalized EEM (GEEM). GEEM has been successfully used in the\nHuman Connectome Project (HCP). However, EEM does not directly address the goal\nof optimal sampling, i.e., achieving large angular separation between sampling\npoints. In this paper, we propose a more natural formulation, called Spherical\nCode (SC), to directly maximize the minimal angle between different samples in\nsingle or multiple shells. We consider not only continuous problems to design\nsingle or multiple shell sampling schemes, but also discrete problems to\nuniformly extract sub-sampled schemes from an existing single or multiple shell\nscheme, and to order samples in an existing scheme. We propose five algorithms\nto solve the above problems, including an incremental SC (ISC), a sophisticated\ngreedy algorithm called Iterative Maximum Overlap Construction (IMOC), an 1-Opt\ngreedy method, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method, and a\nConstrained Non-Linear Optimization (CNLO) method. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first work to use the SC formulation for single or multiple shell sampling\nschemes in dMRI. Experimental results indicate that SC methods obtain larger\nangular separation and better rotational invariance than the state-of-the-art\nEEM and GEEM. The related codes and a tutorial have been released in DMRITool.\n", "  A wide variety of real random composites can be studied by means of\nprototypes of multiphase microstructures with a controllable spatial\ninhomogeneity. To create them, we propose a versatile model of randomly\noverlapping super-spheres of a given radius and deformed in their shape by the\nparameter p. With the help of the so-called decomposable entropic measure, a\nclear dependence of the phase inhomogeneity degree on the values of the\nparameter p is found. Thus, a leading trend in changes of the phase\ninhomogeneity can be forecast. It makes searching for possible\nstructure/property relations easier. For the chosen values of p, examples of\ntwo and three-phase prototypical microstructures show how the phase\ninhomogeneity degree evolves at different length scales. The approach can also\nbe applied to preparing the optimal starting configurations in reconstructing\nreal materials.\n", "  Under two different metric ansatzes, the noncommutative geometry inspired\nblack holes (NCBH) in the framework of Rastall gravity are derived and\nanalyzed. We consider the fluid-type matter with the Gaussian-distribution\nsmeared mass density. Taking a Schwarzschild-like metric ansatz, it is shown\nthat the noncommutative geometry inspired Schwarzschild black hole (NCSBH) in\nRastall gravity, unlike its counterpart in general relativity (GR), is not a\nregular black hole. It has at most one event horizon. After showing a finite\nmaximal temperature, the black hole will leave behind a point-like massive\nremnant at zero temperature. Considering a more general metric ansatz and a\nspecial equation of state of the matter, we also find a regular NCBH in Rastall\ngravity, which has a similar geometric structure and temperature to that of\nNCSBH in GR.\n", "  Symmetry breaking together with strong spin-orbit interaction give rise to\nmany exciting phenomena within condensed matter physics. A recent example is\nthe existence of chiral spin textures, which are observed in magnetic systems\nlacking inversion symmetry. These chiral spin textures, including domain walls\nand magnetic skyrmions, are both fundamentally interesting and technologically\npromising. For example, they can be driven very efficiently by electrical\ncurrents, and exhibit many new physical properties determined by their\nreal-space topological characteristics. Depending on the details of the\ncompeting interactions, these spin textures exist in different parameter\nspaces. However, the governing mechanism underlying their physical behaviors\nremain essentially the same. In this review article, the fundamental\ntopological physics underlying these chiral spin textures, the key factors for\nmaterials optimization, and current developments and future challenges will be\ndiscussed. In the end, a few promising directions that will advance the\ndevelopment of skyrmion based spintronics will be highlighted.\n", "  Last few years have witnessed significant enhancement of thermoelectric\nfigure of merit of lead telluride (PbTe) via nanostructuring. Despite the\nexperimental progress, current understanding of the electron transport in PbTe\nis based on either band structure calculation using first principles with\nconstant relaxation time approximation or empirical models, both relying on\nadjustable parameters obtained by fitting experimental data. Here, we report\nparameter-free first-principles calculation of electron and phonon transport\nproperties of PbTe, including mode-by-mode electron-phonon scattering analysis,\nleading to detailed information on electron mean free paths and the\ncontributions of electrons and phonons with different mean free paths to\nthermoelectric transport properties in PbTe. Such information will help to\nrationalize the use and optimization of nanosctructures to achieve high\nthermoelectric figure of merit.\n", "  It is well known that the Milgrom's MOND (modified Newtonian dynamics)\nexplains well the mass discrepancy problem in galaxy rotation curves. The MOND\npredicts a universal acceleration scale below which the Newtonian dynamics is\ninvalid yet. The universal acceleration scale we got from the SPARC dataset is\n$g_{\\dag}=1.02\\times10^{-10} \\rm m~s^{-2}$. Milgrom suggested that the\nacceleration scale may be a fingerprint of cosmology on local dynamics and\nrelated with the Hubble constant $g_{\\dag}\\sim cH_0$. In this paper, we use the\nhemisphere comparison method with the SPARC dataset to investigate the spatial\nanisotropy on the acceleration scale. We find that the hemisphere of the\nmaximum acceleration scale is in the direction $(l,b) =\n({175.5^\\circ}^{+6^\\circ}_{-10^\\circ}, {-6.5^\\circ}^{+8^\\circ}_{-3^\\circ})$\nwith $g_{\\dag,max}=1.10\\times10^{-10} \\rm m~s^{-2}$, while the hemisphere of\nthe minimum acceleration scale is in the opposite direction $(l,b) =\n({355.5^\\circ}^{+6^\\circ}_{-10^\\circ}, {6.5^\\circ}^{+3^\\circ}_{-8^\\circ})$ with\n$g_{\\dag,min}=0.76\\times10^{-10} \\rm m~s^{-2}$. The maximum anisotropy level\nreaches up to $0.37\\pm0.04$. Robust tests present that such a level of\nanisotropy can't be reproduced by a statistically isotropic data. In addition,\nwe show that the spatial anisotropy on the acceleration scale has little\ncorrelation with the non-uniform distribution of the SPARC data points in sky.\nWe also find that the maximum anisotropy direction is close with other\ncosmological preferred directions, especially the direction of the \"Australia\ndipole\" for the fine structure constant.\n", "  A search for heavy resonances with masses above 1 TeV, decaying to final\nstates containing a vector boson and a Higgs boson, is presented. The search\nconsiders hadronic decays of the vector boson, and Higgs boson decays to b\nquarks. The decay products are highly boosted, and each collimated pair of\nquarks is reconstructed as a single, massive jet. The analysis is performed\nusing a data sample collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in\nproton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to\nan integrated luminosity of 35.9 inverse femtobarns. The data are consistent\nwith the background expectation and are used to place limits on the parameters\nof a theoretical model with a heavy vector triplet. In the benchmark scenario\nwith mass-degenerate W' and Z' bosons decaying predominantly to pairs of\nstandard model bosons, for the first time heavy resonances for masses as high\nas 3.3 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, setting the most stringent\nlimit to date on such states decaying into a vector boson and a Higgs boson.\n", "  In this note, the off-shell generalized Abbott-Deser-Tekin (ADT) formalism is\napplied to explore the mass of Kerr-anti-de Sitter (Kerr-AdS) black holes in\nvarious dimensions within asymptotically rotating frames. The cases in four and\nfive dimensions are explicitly investigated. It is demonstrated that the\nasymptotically rotating effect may make the charge be non-integrable or\nunphysical when the asymptotic non-rotating timelike Killing vector associated\nwith the charge is allowed to vary and the fluctuation of the metric is\ndetermined by the variation of all the mass and rotation parameters. To avoid\nsuch a dilemma, we can let the non-rotating timelike Killing vector be fixed or\nperform calculations in the asymptotically static frame. Our results further\nsupport that the ADT formalism is background-dependent.\n", "  In this Reply we reassert the failure of the model $f(R,T)=R+\\alpha T+ \\beta\nT^2$ in providing a transition from deceleration to an accelerated stage as we\nhave pointed out in [H. Velten and Thiago R. P. Caram\\^es, Phys. Rev. D 95\n(2017) 123536]. We remark that the such a Comment is essentially based on a\ntypo which clearly does not propagate to the rest of the equations and then\ndoes not affect our conclusions. Besides, the authors mentioned an equation for\nthe evolution of the scale factor, already previously used in [P.H.R.S. Moraes,\nG. Ribeiro and R.A.C. Correa, Astrophys. Space Sci. {\\bf 361} 227, (2016)],\nwhich we have shown to be wrong and dimensionally inconsistent.\n", "  We consider a quantum system continuously monitored in time which in turn is\ncoupled to an arbitrary dissipative classical system (diagonal reduced density\nmatrix). The quantum and classical dynamics can modify each other, being\ndescribed by an arbitrary time-irreversible hybrid Lindblad equation. Given a\nmeasurement trajectory, a conditional bipartite stochastic state can be\ninferred by taking into account all previous recording information (filtering).\nHere, we demonstrate that the joint quantum-classical state can also be\ninferred by taking into account both past and future measurement results\n(smoothing). The smoothed hybrid state is estimated without involving\ninformation from unobserved measurement channels. Its average over recording\nrealizations recovers the joint time-irreversible behavior. As an application\nwe consider a fluorescent system monitored by an inefficient photon detector.\nThis feature is taken into account through a fictitious classical two-level\nsystem. The average purity of the smoothed quantum state increases over that of\nthe (mixed) state obtained from the standard quantum jump approach.\n", "  Assuming both that our Universe is evolving into a de Sitter space and a\nvanishing cosmological constant, leaves only the option that the observed\nacceleration is provided by a \"kinetic\" energy of a scalar field. From an\neffective field theory point of view, the absence of Ostrogradsky instabilities\nrestricts the choice to shift-symmetric Horndeski theories. Within these\ntheories, we find the conditions for the existence of a de Sitter critical\npoint in a universe filled by matter, radiation and a Horndeski scalar.\nMoreover, we show that this point is a universal attractor and we provide the\ntracking trajectory. Therefore, if a de Sitter fixed point exists within these\nmodels, our Universe will eventually evolve into a de Sitter space. As an\nexample, we have discussed the case of the combined Galileon-Slotheon system,\nin which the Galileon is kinetically non-minimal coupled to the Einstein\ntensor. Interestingly, we have also found that the tracker trajectory of this\nsystem does not follow previous literature assumptions.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the possibility of using strongly lensed\ngravitational waves (GWs) and their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts as\npowerful cosmic rulers. In the EM domain, it has been suggested that joint\nobservations of the time delay ($\\Delta\\tau$) between lensed quasar images and\nthe velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$) of the lensing galaxy (i.e., the combination\n$\\Delta\\tau/\\sigma^{2}$) are able to constrain the cosmological parameters more\nstrongly than $\\Delta\\tau$ or $\\sigma^{2}$ separately. Here, for the first\ntime, we propose that this $\\Delta\\tau/\\sigma^{2}$ method can be applied to the\nstrongly lensed systems observed in both GW and EM windows. Combining the\nredshifts, images and $\\sigma$ observed in the EM domain with the very precise\n$\\Delta\\tau$ derived from lensed GW signals, we expect that accurate\nmultimessenger cosmology can be achieved in the era of third-generation GW\ndetectors. Comparing with the constraints from the $\\Delta\\tau$ method, we\nprove that using $\\Delta\\tau/\\sigma^{2}$ can improve the discrimination between\ncosmological models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that with $\\sim50$ strongly\nlensed GW-EM systems, we can reach a constraint on the dark energy equation of\nstate $w$ comparable to the 580 Union2.1 Type Ia supernovae data. Much more\nstringent constraints on $w$ can be obtained when combining the $\\Delta\\tau$\nand $\\Delta\\tau/\\sigma^{2}$ methods.\n", "  Since the launch of the highly successful and ongoing Swift mission, the\nfield of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has undergone a revolution. The arcsecond GRB\nlocalizations available within just a few minutes of the GRB alert has\nsignified the continual sampling of the GRB evolution through the prompt to\nafterglow phases revealing unexpected flaring and plateau phases, the first\ndetection of a kilonova coincident with a short GRB, and the identification of\nsamples of low-luminosity, ultra-long, and highly dust extinguished GRBs. The\nincreased numbers of GRB afterglows, GRB-supernova detections, redshifts, and\nhost galaxy associations has greatly improved our understanding of what\nproduces and powers these immense, cosmological explosions. Nevertheless, more\nhigh quality data often also reveal greater complexity. In this review, I\nsummarize some of the milestones made in GRB research during the Swift era, and\nhow previous widely accepted theoretical models have had to adapt to\naccommodate the new wealth of observational data.\n", "  The simultaneous creation of multiple electron-positron pairs by localized\nstrong electric fields is studied by utilizing a time- and space-resolved\nquantum field theory approach. It is demonstrated that the number of\nsimultaneously created pairs equals the number of the potential's supercritical\nquasibound states in the Dirac sea. This means it can be controlled by tuning\nthe potential parameters. Furthermore, the energy of the created particles\ncorresponds to the energy of the supercritical quasibound states. The\nsimultaneously created electrons and positrons are statistically correlated,\nwhich is reflected in the spatial distribution and the momentum distribution of\nthese particles and antiparticles.\n", "  Using a geometric measure of entanglement quantification based on Euclidean\ndistance of the Hermitian matrices, we obtain the minimum distance between a\nbipartite bound entangled $n$- qudit density matrix and the maximally mixed\nstate.This minimum distance for which entangled density matrices necessarily\nhave positive partial transpose (PPT) is obtained as\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d^n(d^n-1)}+1}}$, which is also a lower limit for the\nexistence of 1-distillable entangled states. The separable states necessarily\nlie within a minimum distance of $\\frac{R}{1+d^{n-1}}$ from the Identity,where\nR is the radius of the closed ball homeomorphic to the set of density matrices,\nwhich is lesser than the limit for the limit for PPT bound entangled states.\nFurthermore an alternate proof on the non-emptiness of the PPT bound entangled\nstates has also been given.\n", "  In this brief review, we examine the theoretical consistency and viability of\nphantom dark energy. Almost all data sets from cosmological probes are\ncompatible with dark energy of the phantom variety (i.e., equation-of-state\nparameter $w<-1$) and may even favor evolving dark energy, and since we expect\nevery physical entity to have some kind of field description, we set out to\nexamine the case for phantom dark energy as a field theory. We discuss the many\nattempts at frameworks that may mitigate and eliminate theoretical pathologies\nassociated with phantom dark energy. We also examine frameworks that provide an\napparent measurement $w<-1$ while avoiding the need for a phantom field theory.\n", "  We use data from five stellar occultations observed between 2013 and 2016 to\nconstrain Chariklo's size and shape, and the ring reflectivity. We consider\nfour possible models for Chariklo (sphere, Maclaurin spheroid, tri-axial\nellipsoid and Jacobi ellipsoid) and we use a Bayesian approach to estimate the\ncorresponding parameters. The spherical model has a radius $R=129\\pm3$ km. The\nMaclaurin model has equatorial and polar radii $a=b=143^{+3}_{-6}$ km and\n$c=96^{+14}_{-4}$ km, respectively, with density $970^{+300}_{-180}$ kg\nm$^{-3}$. The ellipsoidal model has semiaxes $a=148^{+6}_{-4}$ km,\n$b=132^{+6}_{-5}$ km and $c=102^{+10}_{-8}$ km. Finally, the Jacobi model has\nsemiaxes $a$=157$\\pm$4 km, $b$=139$\\pm$ 4 km and $c$=86$\\pm$1 km, and density\n$796^{+2}_{-4}$ kg m$^{-3}$ . Depending on the model, we obtain topographic\nfeatures of 6-11 km, typical of Saturn icy satellites with similar size and\ndensity. We constrain Chariklo's geometric albedo between 3.1\\% (sphere) and\n4.9\\% (ellipsoid), while the ring $I/F$ reflectivity is less constrained\nbetween 0.6\\% (Jacobi) and 8.9\\% (sphere). The ellipsoid model explains both\nthe optical light curve and the long-term photometry variation of the system,\ngiving a plausible value for the geometric albedo of the ring particles of\n$10-15\\%$. The derived Chariklo's mass of 6-8$\\times10^{18}$ kg places the\nrings close to the 3:1 resonance between the ring mean motion and Chariklo's\nrotation period.\n", "  We have examined the effect of pump-probe photon energy on the amplitude of\ncoherent optical phonons in a prototypical phase change material using a\nfemtosecond time-resolved transmission technique. The photon energy was varied\nbetween 0.8 and 1.0 eV (corresponding to the wavelength of 1550 and 1200 nm), a\nrange over which there is significant optical contrast between the crystalline\nand amorphous phases of Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Te$_{5}$ (GST225). It was found that in\ncrystalline GST225 the coherent phonon amplitude monotonically increases as the\nphoton energy increases, indicating that the phonon amplitude is enhanced by\ninterband optical absorption, which is associated with the imaginary part of\nthe dielectric function. In amorphous GST225, in contrast, the coherent phonon\namplitude does not depend on the photon energy, remaining almost constant over\nthe tuning range. A possible contribution from the polarizability associated\nwith resonant bonding nature of GST225 is discussed.\n", "  Proposed the computerized method for calculating the relative level of order\ncomposites. Correlation between a level of structure order and properties of\nsolids is shown. Discussed the possibility of clarifying the terminology used\nin describing the structure.\n", "  Nowadays, identification and detection community structures in complex\nnetworks is an important factor in extracting useful information from networks.\nLabel propagation algorithm with near linear-time complexity is one of the most\npopular methods for detecting community structures, yet its uncertainty and\nrandomness is a defective factor. Merging LPA with other community detection\nmetrics would improve its accuracy and reduce instability of LPA. Considering\nthis point, in this paper we tried to use edge betweenness centrality to\nimprove LPA performance. On the other hand, calculating edge betweenness\ncentrality is expensive, so as an alternative metric, we try to use local edge\nbetweenness and present LPA-LEB (Label Propagation Algorithm Local Edge\nBetweenness). Experimental results on both real-world and benchmark networks\nshow that LPA-LEB possesses higher accuracy and stability than LPA when\ndetecting community structures in networks.\n", "  Freezing of water is arguably one of the most common phase transitions on\nEarth and almost always happens heterogeneously. Despite its importance, we\nlack a fundamental understanding of what makes substrates efficient ice\nnucleators. Here we address this by computing the ice nucleation (IN) ability\nof numerous model hydroxylated substrates with diverse surface hydroxyl (OH)\ngroup arrangements. Overall, for the substrates considered, we find that\nneither the symmetry of the OH patterns nor the similarity between a substrate\nand ice correlate well with the IN ability. Instead, we find that the OH\ndensity and the substrate-water interaction strength are useful descriptors of\na material's IN ability. This insight allows the rationalization of ice\nnucleation ability across a wide range of materials, and can aid the search and\ndesign of novel potent ice nucleators in the future.\n", "  Whitham modulation theory for the two dimensional Benjamin-Ono (2DBO)\nequation is presented. A system of five quasi-linear first-order partial\ndifferential equations is derived. The system describes modulations of the\ntraveling wave solutions of the 2DBO equation. These equations are transformed\nto a singularity-free hyrdodynamic-like system referred to here as the\n2DBO-Whitham system. Exact reductions of this system are discussed, the\nformulation of initial value problems is considered, and the system is used to\nstudy the transverse stability of traveling wave solutions of the 2DBO\nequation.\n", "  The Chandra Deep Fields (CDFs), being a major thrust among extragalactic\nX-ray surveys and complemented effectively by multiwavelength observations,\nhave critically contributed to our dramatically improved characterization of\nthe 0.5-8 keV cosmic X-ray background sources, the vast majority of which are\ndistant active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and starburst and normal galaxies. In\nthis review, I highlight some recent key observational results, mostly from the\nCDFs, on the AGN demography, the interactions between AGNs and their host\ngalaxies, the evolution of non-active galaxy X-ray emission, and the census of\nX-ray galaxy groups and clusters through cosmic time, after providing the\nnecessary background information. I then conclude by summarizing some\nsignificant open questions and discussing future prospects for moving forward.\n", "  Quantum walks on graphs have shown prioritized benefits and applications in\nwide areas. In some scenarios, however, it may be more natural and accurate to\nmandate high-order relationships for hypergraphs, due to the density of\ninformation stored inherently. Therefore, we can explore the potential of\nquantum walks on hypergraphs. In this paper, by presenting the one-to-one\ncorrespondence between regular uniform hypergraphs and bipartite graphs, we\nconstruct a model for quantum walks on bipartite graphs of regular uniform\nhypergraphs with Szegedy's quantum walks, which gives rise to a quadratic\nspeed-up. Furthermore, we deliver spectral properties of the transition matrix,\ngiven that the cardinalities of the two disjoint sets are different in the\nbipartite graph. Our model provides the foundation for building quantum\nalgorithms on the strength of quantum walks, suah as quantum walks search,\nquantized Google's PageRank and quantum machine learning, based on hypergraphs.\n", "  Purpose: To develop a general phase regularized image reconstruction method,\nwith applications to partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and flow\nimaging.\n  Theory and Methods: The problem of enforcing phase constraints in\nreconstruction was studied under a regularized inverse problem framework. A\ngeneral phase regularized reconstruction algorithm was proposed to enable\nvarious joint reconstruction of partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and\nflow imaging, along with parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS).\nSince phase regularized reconstruction is inherently non-convex and sensitive\nto phase wraps in the initial solution, a reconstruction technique, named phase\ncycling, was proposed to render the overall algorithm invariant to phase wraps.\nThe proposed method was applied to retrospectively under-sampled in vivo\ndatasets and compared with state of the art reconstruction methods.\n  Results: Phase cycling reconstructions showed reduction of artifacts compared\nto reconstructions with- out phase cycling and achieved similar performances as\nstate of the art results in partial Fourier, water-fat and divergence-free\nregularized flow reconstruction. Joint reconstruction of partial Fourier +\nwater-fat imaging + PI + CS, and partial Fourier + divergence-free regularized\nflow imaging + PI + CS were demonstrated.\n  Conclusion: The proposed phase cycling reconstruction provides an alternative\nway to perform phase regularized reconstruction, without the need to perform\nphase unwrapping. It is robust to the choice of initial solutions and\nencourages the joint reconstruction of phase imaging applications.\n", "  Thermionic energy conversion (TEC) using nano materials is an emerging field\nof research. Graphene can stand high temperature as high as 4600 K in vacuum.\nIts work function can be engineered from its high value (for monolayer/bilayer)\n4.6 eV to 3. 7 eV, 3.8 eV, 3.5 eV and 3.4 eV, through the use of K2CO3, Li2CO3,\nRb2CO3, Cs2CO3 as shown by Kwon et al43 and to as low as 0.7 eV as shown by\nYuan et al. Such remarkable property along with good electrical conductivity,\nhigh dielectric constant makes engineered graphene an ideal candidate to be\nused as both emitter and collector in a thermionic energy converter. Since\nlarge size parabolic trough solar concentrator is now available, there is a\ngreat possibility of harnessing solar energy efficiently and cost effectively,\nif complex functional relation of efficiency of solar energy conversion with\nsolar insolation, area of solar concentrator, work functions (We, Wc) &\ntemperatures, emissivity of emitter and collector, space charge control etc.\ncan be understood clearly. Using modified Richardson-Dushman equation this work\nfocuses on theoretical studies of these aspects, excluding the space charge\ncontrol. What is necessary for high efficiency is good combination of (We, Wc),\nwith a difference > 0.5 eV, proper collector temperature and high solar energy\ninput. Such solar energy conversion would reduce the dependence on silicon\nsolar panel and has great potential for future applications.\n", "  The existence of binary supermassive black holes (SBHs) is predicted by\nmodels of hierarchical galaxy formation. To date, only a single binary SBH has\nbeen imaged, at a projected separation of 7.3 parsecs. Here we report the\ndetection of a candidate dual SBH with projected separation of 0.35 pc in the\ngas-rich interacting spiral galaxy NGC 7674 (Mrk 533). This peculiar Seyfert\ngalaxy possesses a $\\sim$0.7 kpc Z-shaped radio jet; the leading model for the\nformation of such sources postulates the presence of an uncoalesced binary SBH\ncreated during the infall of a satellite galaxy. Using very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI), we imaged the central region of Mrk 533 at radio\nfrequencies of 2, 5, 8 and 15 GHz. Two, possibly inverted-spectrum radio cores\nwere detected at 15 GHz only; the 8-15 GHz spectral indices of the two cores\nare $\\ge-0.33$ and $\\ge-0.38$ ($\\pm 30\\%$), consistent with accreting SBHs. We\nderive a jet speed $\\sim0.28c$ from multi-epoch parsec-scale data of the\nhotspot region, and a source age $\\ge8.2\\times10^3$ yrs.\n", "  The detection of Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone of their stars,\nand their spectroscopic characterization in a search for biosignatures,\nrequires starlight suppression that exceeds the current best ground-based\nperformance by orders of magnitude. The required planet/star brightness ratio\nof order 1e-10 at visible wavelengths can be obtained by blocking stellar\nphotons with an occulter, either externally (a starshade) or internally (a\ncoronagraph) to the telescope system, and managing diffracted starlight, so as\nto directly image the exoplanet in reected starlight. Coronagraph instruments\nrequire advancement in telescope aperture (either monolithic or segmented),\naperture obscurations (obscured by secondary mirror and its support struts),\nand wavefront error sensitivity (e.g. line-of-sight jitter, telescope\nvibration, polarization). The starshade, which has never been used in a science\napplication, benefits a mission by being decoupled from the telescope, allowing\na loosening of telescope stability requirements. In doing so, it transfers the\ndifficult technology from the telescope system to a large deployable structure\n(tens of meters to greater than 100 m in diameter) that must be positioned\nprecisely at a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers from the telescope.\nWe describe in this paper a roadmap to achieving the technological capability\nto search for biosignatures on an Earth-like exoplanet from a future space\ntelescope. Two of these studies, HabEx and LUVOIR, include the direct imaging\nof Earth-sized habitable exoplanets as a central science theme.\n", "  The literature on dynamical systems has, for the most part, considered\nself-oscillators (i.e., systems capable of generating and maintaining a\nperiodic motion at the expense of an external energy source with no\ncorresponding periodicity) either as applications of the concepts of limit\ncycle and Hopf bifurcation in the theory of differential equations, or else as\ninstability problems in feedback control systems. Here we outline a\ncomplementary approach, based on physical considerations of work extraction and\nthermodynamic irreversibility. We illustrate the power of this method with two\nconcrete examples: the mechanical instability of rotors that spin at\nsuper-critical speeds, and the hydrodynamic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the\ninterface between fluid layers with different tangential velocities. Our\ntreatment clarifies the necessary role of frictional or viscous dissipation\n(and therefore of irreversibility), while revealing an underlying unity to the\nphysics of many irreversible processes that generate mechanical work and an\nautonomous temporal structure (periodic, quasi-periodic, or chaotic) in the\npresence of an out-of-equilibrium background.\n", "  We present a framework for reducing all possible cohomogeneity-one strings,\ni.e., strings with geometrical symmetry, in a given spacetime to mechanical\nsystems, and for analyzing integrability of the systems. As applications, it is\nclarified whether the systems of cohomogeneity-one strings in $AdS_5$, $AdS_5\n\\times S^5$, and $AdS_5 \\times T^{p,q}$ are integrable or not. This method may\nreveal a different type of hidden symmetry of spacetimes.\n", "  This paper is concerned with uniqueness in inverse acoustic scattering with\nphaseless far-field data at a fixed frequency. The main difficulty of this\nproblem is the so-called translation invariance property of the modulus of the\nfar-field pattern generated by one plane wave as the incident field. Based on\nour previous work (J. Comput. Phys. 345 (2017), 58-73), the translation\ninvariance property of the phaseless far-field pattern can be broken by using\ninfinitely many sets of superpositions of two plane waves as the incident\nfields at a fixed frequency. In this paper, we prove that the obstacle and the\nindex of refraction of an inhomogeneous medium can be uniquely determined by\nthe phaseless far-field patterns generated by infinitely many sets of\nsuperpositions of two plane waves with different directions at a fixed\nfrequency under the condition that the obstacle is a priori known to be a\nsound-soft or non-absorbing impedance obstacle and the index of refraction $n$\nof the inhomogeneous medium is real-valued and satisfies that either $n-1\\ge\nc_1$ or $n-1\\le-c_1$ in the support of $n-1$ for some positive constant $c_1$.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first uniqueness result in inverse\nscattering with phaseless far-field data. Our proofs are based essentially on\nthe limit of the normalized eigenvalues of the far-field operators which is\nalso established in this paper by using a factorization of the far-field\noperators.\n", "  We explore the two-dimensional extended Hubbard model on the triangular\nlattice in the high doping regime. On-site and nearest-neighbour repulsive\ninteractions are treated in a non-perturbative way by means of Extended\nDynamical Mean Field Theory. We compute the low-temperature phase diagram,\ndisplaying a metallic phase and a symmetry-broken phase for strong intersite\nrepulsions. We describe the correlation effects on both single-particle and\ntwo-particle observables in the metallic phase. Whereas single-particle spectra\nfeature a Hubbard satellite typical of strongly correlated systems, local\nsusceptibilities remain close to their non-interacting limit, even for large\non-site repulsions. We argue that this behaviour is typical of the strongly\ndoped case. We also report a region in parameter space with negative static\nlocal screening.\n", "  We investigate the rank of the average mixing matrix of trees, with all\neigenvalues distinct. The rank of the average mixing matrix of a tree on $n$\nvertices with $n$ distinct eigenvalues is upper-bounded by $\\frac{n}{2}$.\nComputations on trees up to $20$ vertices suggest that the rank attains this\nupper bound most of the times. We give an infinite family of trees whose\naverage mixing matrices have ranks which are bounded away from this upper\nbound. We also give a lower bound on the rank of the average mixing matrix of a\ntree.\n", "  G. Srinivasan et al. (1990) proposed a simple and elegant explanation for the\nreduction of the neutron star magnetic dipole moment during binary evolution\nleading to low mass X-ray binaries and eventually to millisecond pulsars:\nQuantized vortex lines in the neutron star core superfluid will pin against the\nquantized flux lines of the proton superconductor. As the neutron star spins\ndown in the wind accretion phase of binary evolution, outward motion of vortex\nlines will reduce the dipole magnetic moment in proportion to the rotation\nrate. The presence of a toroidal array of flux lines makes this mechanism\ninevitable and independent of the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes.\nThe incompressibility of the flux-line array (Abrikosov lattice) determines the\nepoch when the mechanism will be effective throughout the neutron star. Flux\nvortex pinning will not be effective during the initial young radio pulsar\nphase. It will, however, be effective and reduce the dipole moment in\nproportion with the rotation rate during the epoch of spindown by wind\naccretion as proposed by Srinivasan et al. The mechanism operates also in the\npresence of vortex creep.\n", "  We reveal a triangular-lattice planar photonic crystal supports Bloch modes\nwith radially and azimuthally symmetric electric field distributions at the top\nband-edge of the first photonic band. Bifurcated from the corresponding Bloch\nmodes, two cylindrical vector resonant modes are achieved by simply enlarging\nthe central air-hole of the planar photonic crystal, which have high quality\nfactors around 3,000 and small mode volume. The far-field radiations of the two\nresonant modes present high-quality cylindrical vector beam profiles. The\nresonant modes could be optimized by modifying the six nearest neighboring\nair-holes around the central defect. The cylindrically symmetric\ncharacteristics of the resonant mode's near- and far-fields might provide a new\nview to investigate light-matter interactions and device developments in planar\nphotonic crystal cavities.\n", "  The degree of top polarization and strength of $t\\bar{t}$ correlation are\ndependent on production dynamics, decay mechanism, and choice of the\nobservables. At the LHC, measurement of the top polarization and spin\ncorrelations in $t\\bar{t}$ production is possible through various observables\nrelated to the angular distribution of decay leptons. A measurement of\ndifferential distribution provides a precision test of the standard model of\nparticle physics and probes for deviations, which could be a sign of new\nphysics. In particular, the phase space for the super-symmetric partner of the\ntop quark can be constrained. Results from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)\ncollaboration for top quark polarization and spin correlation in the dileptonic\nchannel are reviewed briefly in this proceeding. The measurements are obtained\nusing 19.5 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in pp collisions at the center-of-mass\nenergy of 8 TeV.\n", "  We demonstrate that multiply-coupled spinor polariton condensates can be\noptically tuned through a sequence of spin-ordered phases by changing the\ncoupling strength between nearest neighbors. For closed 4-condensate chains\nthese phases span from ferromagnetic (FM) to antiferromagnetic (AFM), separated\nby an unexpected crossover phase. This crossover phase is composed of\nalternating FM-AFM bonds. For larger 8 condensate chains, we show the critical\nrole of spatial inhomogeneities and demonstrate a scheme to overcome them and\nprepare any desired spin state. Our observations thus demonstrate a fully\ncontrollable non-equilibrium spin lattice.\n", "  Certain theorems of existence, non-existence and uniqueness for boundary\nvalue problems modelling axial symmetric problems in general relativity are\npresented using the Weyl's metric. A solution related to the classical\nPoiseuille of non-relativistic fluid mechanics is also presented.\n", "  Unsteady heat transfer in a harmonic chain is analyzed. Two types of thermal\nperturbations are considered: 1) initial instant temperature perturbation, 2)\nexternal heat supply. Closed equations describing the heat propagation are\nobtained and their analytical solution is constructed.\n", "  We study the dynamical structure of a bimodal galaxy cluster Abell 3653 at\nz=0.1089 by using combined optical and X-ray data. Observations include\narchival data from Anglo-Australian Telescope and X-ray observatories of\nXMM-Newton and Chandra. We draw a global picture for A3653 using galaxy\ndensity, X-ray luminosity and temperature maps. Galaxy distribution has a\nregular morphological shape at the 3 Mpc size. Galaxy density map shows an\nelongation EW direction, which perfectly aligns with the extended diffuse X-ray\nemission. We detect two dominant grouping around two brightest cluster galaxies\n(BCGs). The BCG1 (z=0.1099) can be associated with the main cluster A3653E, and\na foreground subcluster A3563W concentrated at the BCG2 (z=0.1075). Both X-ray\npeaks are dislocated from BCGs by ($\\sim$35 kpc), which suggest an ongoing\nmerger process. We measure the subclusters' gas temperatures 4.67 and 3.66 keV,\nrespectively. Two-body dynamical analysis shows that A3653E & A3653W are very\nlikely (93.5% probability) gravitationally bound. The highly favoured scenario\nsuggests that two subclusters with the mass ratio of 1.4 are colliding close to\nthe plane of sky ($\\alpha$=17$^\\circ$.61) with 2400 km $s^{-1}$, and will\nundergo core passage in 380 Myr. Temperature map also significantly shows a\nshock-heated gas (6.16 keV) in between the subclusters, which confirms the\nsupersonic infalling scenario.\n", "  Understanding the bending mechanics of uncured carbon fibre prepreg is vital\nfor modelling forming processes and the formation of out-of-plane wrinkling\ndefects. This paper presents a modification of standard Dynamic Mechanical\nAnalysis (DMA) to characterise the viscoelastic bending mechanics of uncured\ncarbon fibre prepreg using Timoshenko beam theory. By post-processing DMA\nresults, the analysis provides temperature and rate-dependent values of inter\nand intra-ply shear stiffness for a carbon fibre laminate and each individual\nply with experimental results for AS4/8552 presented. The new methodology\nprovides a means to parametrise process models, and also gives an indication of\noptimal manufacturing conditions to enable defect-free forming and\nconsolidation processes.\n", "  The article describes fabrication and properties of composite fibrous\nscaffolds obtained by electrospinning of the solution of\npoly({\\epsilon}-caprolactone) and arginine in common solvent. The influence of\narginine content on structure, mechanical, surface and biological properties of\nthe scaffolds was investigated. It was found that with an increase of arginine\nconcentration diameter of the scaffold fibers was reduced, which was\naccompanied by an increase of scaffold strength and Young modulus. It was\ndemonstrated that porosity and water contact angle of the scaffold are\nindependent from arginine content. The best cell adhesion and viability was\nshown on scaffolds with arginine concentration from 0.5 to 1 % wt.\n", "  A present prevailing open problem planetary nebulae research, and\nphotoionized gaseous nebulae research at large, is the systematic discrepancies\nin ionic abundances derived from recombination and collisionally excited lines\nin many H II regions and planetary nebulae. Peimbert (1967) proposed that these\ndiscrepancies were due to 'temperature fluctuations' in the plasma, but the\namplitude of such fluctuations remain unexplained by standard phtoionization\nmodeling. In this letter we show that large amplitude temperature oscillations\nare expected to form in gaseous nebulae photoionized by short-period binary\nstars. Such stars yield periodically varying ionizing radiation fields, which\ninduce periodic oscilla- tions in the heating-minus-cooling function across the\nnebula. For flux oscillation periods of a few days any temperature\nperturbations in the gas with frequencies similar to those of the ionizing\nsource will undergo resonant amplification. In this case, the rate of growth of\nthe perturbations increases with the amplitude of the variations of the\nionizing flux and with decreasing nebular equilibrium temperature. We also\npresent a line ratios diagnostic plot that combines [O III] collisional lines\nand O II recombination lines for diagnosing equilibrium and fluctuation am-\nplitude temperatures in gaseous nebulae. When applying this diagnostic to the\nplanetary nebula M 1-42 we find an equilibrium temperature of ~6000 K and a\nresonant temperature fluctuation amplitude (Trtf ) of ~4000 K. This equilibrium\ntemperature is significantly lower than the temperature estimated when\ntemperature perturbations are ignored.\n", "  Spin accumulation induced by spin-orbit coupling is experimentally quantified\nin stack with in-plane magnetic anisotropy via the contribution of spin\naccumulation to Hall resistances. Using a biasing direct current the spin\naccumulation within the structure can be tuned, enabling quantification.\nQuantification shows the spin accumulation can be more than ten percentage of\nlocal magnetization, when the electric current is 1E11 A/m*m. The spin\naccumulation is dependent of the thickness of Ta layer, the trend agrees with\nthat of spin Hall angle indicating the capability of Ta and Pt in generating\nspins.\n", "  The protein folding problem is stated and a list of properties that do not\ndepend upon specific molecules is compiled and analyzed. The relationship of\nthis analysis to future simulations is emphasized. The choice of power and time\nas variables as opposed to energy and time is discussed. A wave motion model is\nreviewed and related to the action in classical mechanics. It is argued that\nthe properties of the action support the idea that folding takes place in small\nsteps. It is explained how catastrophe theory has been employed in wave motion\nmodels and how it can be used in examination of successful simulations\n", "  This paper identifies the salient factors that characterize the inequality\nincome distribution for Romania. Data analysis is rigorously carried out using\nsophisticated techniques borrowed from classical statistics (Theil).\nDecomposition of the inequalities measured by the Theil index is also\nperformed. This study relies on an exhaustive (11.1 million records for 2014)\ndata-set for total personal gross income of Romanian citizens.\n", "  We investigate dynamics and interactions of particles levitated and trapped\nby the thermophoretic force in a vacuum cell. Our analysis is based on footage\ntaken by orthogonal cameras that are able to capture the three dimensional\ntrajectories of the particles. In contrast to spherical particles, which remain\nstationary at the center of the cell, here we report new qualitative features\nof the motion of particles with non-spherical geometry. Singly levitated\nparticles exhibit steady spinning around their body axis and rotation around\nthe symmetry axis of the cell. When two levitated particles approach each\nother, repulsive or attractive interactions between the particles are observed.\nOur levitation system offers a wonderful platform to study interaction between\nparticles in a microgravity environment.\n", "  We present direct images in the H$\\alpha$ and [SII]$\\lambda \\lambda$6717,6731\n$\\text{\\AA}$ lines of the Galactic Supernova Remnant G109.1-1.0 (CTB 109). We\nconfirm that the filaments detected are the optical counterpart of the X-ray\nand radio supernova remnant due to their high [SII]/H$\\alpha$ line-ratios. We\nstudy for the first time the kinematics of the optical counterpart of SNR CTB\n109 using the UNAM scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer PUMA. We estimate a\nsystemic velocity of V$_{LSR}$=-50$\\pm$6 km s$^{-1}$ for this remnant and an\nexpansion velocity of V$_{exp}$=230$\\pm$5 km s$^{-1}$. From this velocity value\nand taking into account previous studies about the kinematics of objects at\nthat Galactic longitude we derive a distance to the SNR CTB 109 of 3.1$\\pm$0.2\nkpc, locating it in the Perseus arm. Using the\n[SII]$\\lambda$6717/[SII]$\\lambda$6731 line-ratio we find an electronic density\nvalue around n$_e$= 580 cm$^{-3}$. Considering that this remnant is evolving in\na low density medium with higher density cloudlets responsible of the optical\nemission, we determine the age and energy deposited in the ISM by the supernova\nexplosion (E$_0$) in both the Sedov-Taylor phase and the radiative phase. For\nboth cases the age is of thousands of years and the E$_0$ is rather typical of\nSNRs containing simple pulsars so that, the energy released to the ISM cannot\nbe used to distinguish between supernova remnants hosting typical pulsars from\nthose hosting powerful magnetars as in the case of CTB 109.\n", "  We have computed the circulation integrations of thermal vorticity with and\nwithout charged currents in dissipative fluids. We find that the relativistic\nKelvin circulation theorem will be modified by the dissipative effects,\ntherefore, the circulation integrations of thermal vorticity may not be\nconserved during the fluid evolution.\n", "  The magnetic and thermal evolution of neutron stars is a very complex process\nwith many nonlinear interactions. For a decent understanding of neutron star\nphysics, these evolutions cannot be considered isolated. A brief overview is\npresented, which describes the main magnetothermal interactions that determine\nthe fate of both isolated neutron stars and accreting ones. Special attention\nis devoted to the interplay of thermal and magnetic evolution at the polar cap\nof radio pulsars. There, a strong meridional temperature gradient is maintained\nover the lifetime of radio pulsars. It may be strong enough to drive\nthermoelectric magnetic field creation which perpetuate a toroidal magnetic\nfield around the polar cap rim. Such a local field component may amplify and\ncurve the poloidal surface field at the cap, forming a strong and small scale\nmagnetic field as required for the radio emission of pulsars\n", "  In this paper, we investigate numerically the trapped modes with near zero\ngroup velocities supported in the ring array composed of dielectric nanorods,\nbased on a two-dimensional model. Two sorts of trapped modes in the ring array\nhave been identified: the BCR trapped modes which correspond to the bound modes\nbelow the light line at the edge of the first Brillouin zone in the\ncorresponding planar structure (namely the infinite linear chain); the\nquasi-BIC trapped modes corresponding to the bound states in the continuum\nsupported in the infinite linear chain. According to the whispering gallery\ncondition, the BCR trapped modes can be supported in the ring array only when\nthe number of dielectric elements N is even, while the quasi-BIC ones always\nexist no matter whether N is odd or even. For both two kind of trapped modes,\nthe lowest one of each kind possesses the highest Q factor, which are ~105 for\nBCR kind and ~1011 for quasi-BIC kind with N=16 respectively, and the radiation\nloss increases dramatically as the structural resonance increases. Finally, the\nbehavior of the Q factor with N is explained numerically for the lowest one of\neach kind of trapped modes. The Q factor scales as Q~exp(0.662N) for the\nquasi-BIC trapped mode and Q~exp(0.325N) for the BCR one. Intriguingly, the Q\nfactor of the quasi-BIC trapped mode can be as large as ~105 even at N=8.\nCompared to the finite linear chain, the structure of ring array exhibits\noverwhelming advantage in Q factor with the same N because there is no\narray-edge radiation loss in the ring array. We note that the principles can\ncertainly be extended to particles of other shapes (such as nanospheres,\nnanodisks, and many other experimentally feasible geometries).\n", "  Basic R & D have been carried out with one small straw tube detector\nprototype with premixed gas of Ar+CO2 in 70:30 and 90:10 ratio. The gain and\nthe energy resolution are measured with Fe55 X-ray source. Effect of\ntemperature and pressure on these parameters are measured. The variation of\ngain and energy resolution with rate per unit length are also measured. The\ndetails of the test set-up, the method of measurement and the test results are\npresented in this paper.\n", "  We report on a recent investigation on heavy quarkonium hybrids that goes\nbeyond the usual Born-Oppenheimer approximation by including not only the\nmixing between nearby hybrid states but also the mixing with quarkonium states.\nWe use a systematic effective field theory framework based on NRQCD together\nwith lattice QCD inputs. Short and long distance constraints from weak coupling\npNRQCD and the QCD effective string theory are also employed. We calculate the\nquarkonium and hybrid spectrum for charmonium and bottomonium, and estimate a\nnumber of decay widths. Most of the isospin zero $XYZ$ resonances fit in our\nspectrum either as quarkonia or as hybrid states. The mixing of hybrid states\nwith quarkonia produces enhanced spin symmetry violations, which are\ninstrumental to understand certain decays. We also present new results on the\nhyperfine splittings.\n", "  A set of density functionals coming from different rungs on Jacob's ladder\nare employed to evaluate the electronic excited states of three Ru(II)\ncomplexes. While most studies on the performance of density functionals compare\nthe vertical excitation energies, in this work we focus on the energy gaps\nbetween the electronic excited states, of the same and different multiplicity.\nExcited state energy gaps are important for example to determine radiationless\ntransition probabilities. Besides energies, a functional should deliver the\ncorrect state character and state ordering. Therefore, wavefunction overlaps\nare introduced to systematically evaluate the effect of different functionals\non the character of the excited states. As a reference, the energies and state\ncharacters from multi-state second-order perturbation theory complete active\nspace (MS-CASPT2) are used. In comparison to MS-CASPT2, it is found that while\nhybrid functionals provide better vertical excitation energies, pure\nfunctionals typically give more accurate excited state energy gaps. Pure\nfunctionals are also found to reproduce the state character and ordering in\ncloser agreement to MS-CASPT2 than the hybrid functionals.\n", "  The friction-induced charging (i.e., tribocharging) and the following\ndischarging (referred here as tribodischarging) are always believed to have\nnegative effects on the daily life and on the industrial production. Thus, how\nto inhibit the tribocharging and the tribodischarging has caused wide public\nconcern. Because the discharge caused by the electrical breakdown of the\nambient gas is generally accompanied with the generation of light, we\ninvestigated here the tribocharging and the tribodischarging by observing the\nlight emitted during friction. We found that the position reversal of the\nfriction pair has a dramatic impact on the intensity of the tribo-induced\nlight. Experimental results show that an intense light is produced when a\nstationary Al2O3 disk is sliding on a rotating SiO2 disk, but only a weak light\nis observed for the case of a stationary SiO2 disk and a rotating Al2O3 disk.\nThis means that the process of the tribocharging and the tribodischarging can\nbe significantly influenced owing to the change in the relative position of the\nfriction couple. The experimentally measured polarities of the tribo-induced\ncharge on the friction surfaces further indicated that the strong discharging\noccurs when the rotating surface is negatively charged. The reason for the\ndifference in the intensity of the tribocharging and tribodischarging can be\nattributed to the combined effects of the contact potential difference and the\ntemperature gradient between the contacting surfaces on the charge transfer\nwhen friction. Finally, a simple, low cost, yet effective approach, i.e., just\nkeep the friction partner whose surface is tribo-induced negatively charged as\nthe stationary one, can be utilized to suppress the intensity of the\ntribocharging and the tribodischarging. This work may provide potential\napplications in numerous areas of science and engineering and also in the\neveryday life.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to explore mathematical aspects associated with\nthe application of the direct interaction approximation (DIA) (Kraichnan\n[1],[2]) to the non-Markovianized stochastic models in the turbulence problem.\nThis process is shown to lead to a functional equation, and construction of\nsolutions of this equation is addressed within the framework of a continued\nfraction representation. The relation of the DIA solution to the perturbative\nsolution is discussed. The DIA procedure is applied to the problem of wave\npropagation in a random medium, which is described by a stochastic differential\nequation, with the characteristics of the medium represented by stochastic\ncoefficients. The results are compared with those given by the perturbative\nprocedure.\n", "  The central goal of this thesis is to develop methods to experimentally study\ntopological phases. We do so by applying the powerful toolbox of quantum\nsimulation techniques with cold atoms in optical lattices. To this day, a\ncomplete classification of topological phases remains elusive. In this context,\nexperimental studies are key, both for studying the interplay between topology\nand complex effects and for identifying new forms of topological order. It is\ntherefore crucial to find complementary means to measure topological properties\nin order to reach a fundamental understanding of topological phases. In one\ndimensional chiral systems, we suggest a new way to construct and identify\ntopologically protected bound states, which are the smoking gun of these\nmaterials. In two dimensional Hofstadter strips (i.e: systems which are very\nshort along one dimension), we suggest a new way to measure the topological\ninvariant directly from the atomic dynamics.\n", "  We present quantities which characterize the sensitivity of\ngravitational-wave observatories to sources at cosmological distances. In\nparticular, we introduce and generalize the horizon, range, response, and reach\ndistances. These quantities incorporate a number of important effects,\nincluding cosmologically well-defined distances and volumes, cosmological\nredshift, cosmological time dilation, and rate density evolution. In addition,\nthese quantities incorporate unique aspects of gravitational wave detectors,\nsuch as the variable sky sensitivity of the detectors and the scaling of the\nsensitivity with inverse distance. An online calculator\n(http://gwc.rcc.uchicago.edu) and python notebook\n(https://github.com/hsinyuc/distancetool) to determine GW distances are\navailable. We provide answers to the question: \"How far can gravitational-wave\ndetectors hear?\"\n", "  Residual stresses may appear in elastic bodies due to the formation of\nmisfits in the micro-structure, driven by plastic deformations, thermal or\ngrowth processes. They are especially widespread in living matter, resulting\nfrom the dynamic remodelling processes aiming at optimizing the overall\nstructural response to environmental physical forces. From a mechanical\nviewpoint, residual stresses are classically modelled through the introduction\nof a virtual incompatible state that collects the local relaxed states around\neach material point. In this work, we instead employ an alternative approach\nbased on a strain energy function that constitutively depends only on the\ndeformation gradient and the residual stress tensor. In particular, our\nobjective is to study the morphological stability of an incompressible sphere,\nmade of a neo-Hookean material and subjected to given distributions of residual\nstresses. Firstly, we perform a linear stability analysis on the pre-stressed\nsolid sphere using the method of incremental deformations. The marginal\nstability conditions are given as a function of a control parameter, being the\ndimensionless variable that represents the characteristic intensity of the\nresidual stresses. Secondly, we perform finite element simulations using a\nmixed formulation in order to investigate the post-buckling morphology in the\nfully nonlinear regime. Considering different distributions of the residual\nstresses, we find that different morphological transitions occur around the\nmaterial domain where the hoop residual stress reaches its maximum compressive\nvalue. The results provide useful guidelines in order to design morphable soft\nspheres, for example by controlling the residual stresses through active\ndeformations. They finally suggest a viable solution for the nondestructive\ncharacterization of residual stresses in soft tissues, such as solid tumors.\n", "  Though the electrical responses of the various polymorphs found in\nferroelectric polycrystalline thin film HfO$_2$ are now well characterized,\nlittle is currently understood of this novel material's grain sub-structure. In\nparticular, the formation of domain and phase boundaries requires investigation\nto better understand phase stabilization, switching, and interconversion. Here,\nwe apply scanning transmission electron microscopy to investigate the atomic\nstructure of boundaries in these materials. In particular, we find\northorhombic/orthorhombic domain walls and coherent orthorhombic/monoclinic\ninterphase boundaries formed throughout individual grains. The results inform\nhow interphase boundaries can impose strain conditions that may be key to phase\nstabilization. Moreover, the atomic structure near interphase boundary walls\nsuggests potential for their mobility under bias, which has been speculated to\noccur in perovskite morphotropic phase boundary systems by mechanisms similar\nto domain boundary motion.\n", "  The following topics are considered: the identification of objects on search\nmaps, the determination of their coordinates at the epoch of 2000, and\nconverting into a machine readable format the published version of E.S.\nBrodskaya and V.F. Shajn catalogue of 1958. The statistics for photometric and\nspectral data from the original catalogue is presented. A digital version of\nthe catalogue is described, as well as its presentation in HTML, VOTable and\nAJS formats and the basic principles of work in the interactive application of\nInternational Virtual Observatory the Aladin sky atlas.\n", "  The low frequency, long wavelength electromagnetic waves, viz, shear Alfven\nwave in quantum electron-positron-ion magneto plasmas, have been examined using\nquantum magneto hydrodynamic model. In this model, we have considered electrons\nand positrons are to be magnetized as well as degenerate whereas ions are\nmagnetized but classical. We have also included the effects of exchange\ncorrelation terms which appear entirely the dynamic equations of electrons and\npositrons. The whole treatment is done using multi-fluid model. Our object is\nto study the shear Alfv\\'en waves propagating in above said system of plasma.\nFor that we have derived the modified dispersion relation of the shear Alfv\\'en\nwaves. Results are relevant to the terrestrial laboratory astrophysics.\n", "  We introduce a map which reproduces qualitatively many fundamental properties\nof the dynamics of heavy particles in fluid flows. These include a uniform rate\nof decrease of volume in phase space, a slow-manifold effective dynamics when\nthe single parameter $s$ (analogous of the Stokes number) approaches zero, the\npossibility of fold caustics in the \"velocity field\", and a minimum, as a\nfunction of $s$, of the Lyapunov (Kaplan-Yorke) dimension of the attractor\nwhere particles accumulate.\n", "  We present a quantu spin liquid state in a spin-1/2 honeycomb lattice with\nrandomness in the exchange interaction. That is, we successfully introduce\nrandomness into the organic radial-based complex and realize a random-singlet\n(RS) state. All magnetic and thermodynamic experimental results indicate the\nliquid-like behaviors, which are consistent with those expected in the RS\nstate. These results demonstrate that the randomness or inhomogeneity in the\nactual systems stabilize the RS state and yield liquid-like behavior.\n", "  Transient dynamics of heat conduction in isotropic fractal media is\ninvestigated. By using the Laplacian operator in non-integer dimension, we\nanalytically and numerically study the impact of dimensionality on the\nevolution of the temperature profile, heat flux and excess energy under certain\ninitial and boundary conditions. We find that larger dimension can promote the\nheat diffusion. Particularly, with randomly distributed absorbing heat sinks in\nthe fractal media, we obtain a non-exponential decay behavior of the heat pulse\ndiffusion, and an optimal dimension for efficient heat absorption depending on\nsink concentrations. Our results may have potential applications in controlling\ntransient heat conduction in fractal media, which will be ubiquitous as porous,\ncomposite, networked materials.\n", "  Research on social contagion dynamics has not yet including a theoretical\nanalysis of the ubiquitous local trend imitation (LTI) characteristic. We\npropose a social contagion model with a tent-like adoption probability\ndistribution to investigate the effect of this LTI characteristic on behavior\nspreading. We also propose a generalized edge-based compartmental theory to\ndescribe the proposed model. Through extensive numerical simulations and\ntheoretical analyses, we find a crossover in the phase transition: when the LTI\ncapacity is strong, the growth of the final behavior adoption size exhibits a\nsecond-order phase transition. When the LTI capacity is weak, we see a\nfirst-order phase transition. For a given behavioral information transmission\nprobability, there is an optimal LTI capacity that maximizes the final behavior\nadoption size. Finally we find that the above phenomena are not qualitatively\naffected by the heterogeneous degree distribution. Our suggested theory agrees\nwith the simulation results.\n", "  We have performed ab-initio calculations using plane-wave ultraviolet\npseudopotential technique based on the density-functional theory (DFT) to study\nthe structural, mechanical, electronic, optical and thermodynamic properties of\northorhombic MgV2O6. The calculated lattice parameters are in good agreement\nwith the available experimental data. The second-order elastic constants and\nthe other relevant quantities such as the Youngs modulus, shear modulus,\nPoissons ratio, compressibility, anisotropy factor, sound velocity, and Debye\ntemperature have been calculated. After analyzing the calculated elastic\nconstants, it is shown that the compound under study is mechanically stable.\nThe analysis of the electronic band structure shows that this compound reveals\nsemiconducting nature with band gap 2.195 eV and the contribution predominantly\ncomes from O-2s states.\n", "  A detailed survey of the current trends and recent advances in rotary\nmechanical circulatory support systems is presented in this paper. Rather than\nclinical reports, the focus is on technological aspects of these rehabilitating\ndevices as a reference for engineers and biomedical researchers. Existing\ntrends in flow regimes, flow control, and bearing mechanisms are summarized.\nSystem specifications and applications of the most prominent continuous-flow\nventricular assistive devices are provided. Based on the flow regime, pumps are\ncategorized as axial flow, centrifugal flow, and mixed flow. Unique\ncharacteristics of each system are unveiled through an examination of the\nstructure, bearing mechanism, impeller design, flow rate, and biocompatibility.\nA discussion on the current limitations is provided to invite more studies and\nfurther improvements.\n", "  Motivated by the recent numerical simulations for doped $t$-$J$ model on\nhoneycomb lattice, we study superconductivity of singlet and triplet pairing on\nhoneycomb lattice Hubbard model. We show that a superconducting state with\ncoexisting spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairings is induced by the\nantiferromagnetic order near half-filling. The superconducting state we obtain\nhas a topological phase transition that separates a topologically trivial state\nand a nontrivial state with Chern number two. Possible experimental realization\nof such a topological superconductivity is also discussed.\n", "  Living cells move thanks to assemblies of actin filaments and myosin motors\nthat range from very organized striated muscle tissue to disordered\nintracellular bundles. The mechanisms powering these disordered structures are\ndebated, and all models studied so far predict that they are contractile. We\nreexamine this prediction through a theoretical treatment of the interplay of\nthree well-characterized internal dynamical processes in actomyosin bundles:\nactin treadmilling, the attachement-detachment dynamics of myosin and that of\ncrosslinking proteins. We show that these processes enable an extensive control\nof the bundle's active mechanics, including reversals of the filaments'\napparent velocities and the possibility of generating extension instead of\ncontraction. These effects offer a new perspective on well-studied in vivo\nsystems, as well as a robust criterion to experimentally elucidate the\nunderpinnings of actomyosin activity.\n", "  A new method is proposed for determining the ground state wave function of a\nquantum many-body system on a quantum computer, without requiring an initial\ntrial wave function that has good overlap with the true ground state. The\ntechnique of Spectral Combing involves entangling an arbitrary initial wave\nfunction with a set of auxiliary qubits governed by a time dependent\nHamiltonian, resonantly transferring energy out of the initial state through a\nplethora of avoided level crossings into the auxiliary system. The number of\navoided level crossings grows exponentially with the number of qubits required\nto represent the Hamiltonian, so that the efficiency of the algorithm does not\nrely on any particular energy gap being large. We give an explicit construction\nof the quantum gates required for the realization of this procedure and explore\nthe results of classical simulations of the algorithm on a small quantum\ncomputer with up to 8 qubits. We show that for certain systems and comparable\nresults, Spectral Combing requires fewer quantum gates to realize than the\nQuantum Adiabatic Algorithm.\n", "  In the present study it is shown that significant impacts on forests can lead\nto large climate fluctuations at global level. This research takes into account\nvarious scenarios for the reconstruction of forest areas using the\ngeo-ecological information-modeling system. This tool is described as a\npossible improvement of the Big Data approach. Its structure includes 24 blocks\nthat combine a series of models and algorithms for the global processing of\nlarge data and their analysis. The key block of this tool is the global model\nof the climate-nature-society system.\n", "  An apparently ideal way to generate continuous bounded stochastic processes\nis to consider the stochastically perturbed motion of a point of small mass in\nan infinite potential well, under overdamped approximation. Here, however, we\nshow that the aforementioned procedure can be fallacious and lead to incorrect\nresults. We indeed provide a counter-example concerning one of the most\nemployed bounded noises, hereafter called Tsallis-Stariolo-Borland (TSB) noise,\nwhich admits the well known Tsallis q-statistics as stationary density. In\nfact, we show that for negative values of the Tsallis parameter q\n(corresponding to sufficiently large diffusion coefficient of the stochastic\nforce), the motion resulting from the overdamped approximation is unbounded. We\nthen investigate the cause of the failure of Kramers first type approximation,\nand we formally show that the solutions of the full Newtonian non-approximated\nmodel are bounded, following the physical intuition. Finally, we provide a new\nfamily of bounded noises extending the TSB noise, the boundedness of whose\nsolutions we formally show.\n", "  In this paper we investigate critical Gagliardo-Nirenberg, Trudinger-type and\nBrezis-Gallouet-Wainger inequalities associated with the positive Rockland\noperators on graded groups, which includes the cases of $\\mathbb R^n$,\nHeisenberg, and general stratified Lie groups. As an application, using the\ncritical Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality the existence of least energy solutions\nof nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger type equations is obtained. We also express the best\nconstant in the critical Gagliardo-Nirenberg and Trudinger inequalities in the\nvariational form as well as in terms of the ground state solutions of the\ncorresponding nonlinear subelliptic equations. The obtained results are already\nnew in the setting of general stratified groups (homogeneous Carnot groups).\nAmong new technical methods, we also extend Folland's analysis of H\\\"older\nspaces from stratified groups to general homogeneous groups.\n", "  We report the relative abundances of the three stable isotopes of silicon,\n$^{28}$Si, $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si, across the Galaxy using the $v = 0, J = 1\n\\to 0$ transition of silicon monoxide. The chosen sources represent a range in\nGalactocentric radii ($R_{\\rm GC}$) from 0 to 9.8 kpc. The high spectral\nresolution and sensitivity afforded by the GBT permit isotope ratios to be\ncorrected for optical depths. The optical-depth-corrected data indicate that\nthe secondary-to-primary silicon isotope ratios $^{29}{\\rm Si}/^{28}{\\rm Si}$\nand $^{30}{\\rm Si}/^{28}{\\rm Si}$ vary much less than predicted on the basis of\nother stable isotope ratio gradients across the Galaxy. Indeed, there is no\ndetectable variation in Si isotope ratios with $R_{\\rm GC}$. This lack of an\nisotope ratio gradient stands in stark contrast to the monotonically decreasing\ntrend with $R_{\\rm GC}$ exhibited by published secondary-to-primary oxygen\nisotope ratios. These results, when considered in the context of the\nexpectations for chemical evolution, suggest that the reported oxygen isotope\nratio trends, and perhaps that for carbon as well, require further\ninvestigation. The methods developed in this study for SiO isotopologue ratio\nmeasurements are equally applicable to Galactic oxygen, carbon and nitrogen\nisotope ratio measurements, and should prove useful for future observations of\nthese isotope systems.\n", "  In this paper, the linear sigma model is studied using a method for finding\nanalytical solutions based on Pad\\'e approximants. Using the solutions of two\nand three traveling waves in 1+3 dimensions we found, we are able to show a\nsolution that is valid for an arbitrary number of bosons and traveling waves.\n", "  Recently, topological semimetals become hot topic in condensed matter\nphysics, including Dirac semimetal, Weyl semimetal, and nodal line semimetal\n(NLSM). In this paper, a new type of node- line semimetal - type-II NLSM is\nproposed based on a two-band cubic lattice model. For type-II NLSM, the zero\nenergy bulk states have a closed loop in momentum space but the (local) Weyl\ncones on nodal line become tilted. The effect of magnetic field and that of\ncorrelation on type-II NLSM are studied. In particular, after considering\nrepulsive interaction and additional spin degrees of freedom, different types\nof long range magnetic orders appear in bulk states. In addition, the\ninteraction-induced ferromagnetic order of surface states may exist. At\ncritical point between type-I NLSM and type-II NLSM, arbitrary tiny interaction\ninduces ferromagnetic order due to a flat band at Fermi surface.\n", "  Here, we report orbital-free density-functional theory (OF DFT) molecular\ndynamics simulations of the displacement cascade in aluminum. The electronic\neffect is our main concern. The displacement threshold energies are calculated\nusing OF DFT and classical molecular dynamics (MD) and the comparison reveals\nthe role of charge bridge. Compared to MD simulation, the displacement spike\nfrom OF DFT has a lower peak and shorter duration time, which is attributed to\nthe effect of electronic damping. The charge density profiles clearly display\nthe existence of depleted zones, vacancy and interstitial clusters. And it is\nfound that the energy exchanges between ions and electrons are mainly\ncontributed by the kinetic energies.\n", "  Extremely fast pattern recognition capabilities are necessary to find and fit\nbillions of tracks at the hardware trigger level produced every second\nanticipated at high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) running conditions. Associative\nMemory (AM) based approaches for fast pattern recognition have been proposed as\na potential solution to the tracking trigger. However, at the HL-LHC, there is\nmuch less time available and speed performance must be improved over previous\nsystems while maintaining a comparable number of patterns. The Vertically\nIntegrated Pattern Recognition Associative Memory (VIPRAM) Project aims to\nachieve the target pattern density and performance goal using 3DIC technology.\nThe first step taken in the VIPRAM work was the development of a 2D prototype\n(protoVIPRAM00) in which the associative memory building blocks were designed\nto be compatible with the 3D integration. In this paper, we present the results\nfrom extensive performance studies of the protoVIPRAM00 chip in both realistic\nHL-LHC and extreme conditions. Results indicate that the chip operates at the\ndesign frequency of 100 MHz with perfect correctness in realistic conditions\nand conclude that the building blocks are ready for 3D stacking. We also\npresent performance boundary characterization of the chip under extreme\nconditions.\n", "  Ferromagnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials are in demand for spintronic\ndevices with all-two-dimensional-materials heterostructures. Here, we\ndemonstrate mechanical exfoliation of magnetic-atom-intercalated transition\nmetal dichalcogenide Cr1/3TaS2 from its bulk crystal; previously such\nintercalated materials were thought difficult to exfoliate. Magnetotransport in\nexfoliated tens-of-nanometres-thick flakes revealed ferromagnetic ordering\nbelow its Curie temperature TC ~ 110 K as well as strong in-plane magnetic\nanisotropy; these are identical to its bulk properties. Further, van der Waals\nheterostructure assembly of Cr1/3TaS2 with another intercalated ferromagnet\nFe1/4TaS2 is demonstrated using a dry-transfer method. The fabricated\nheterojunction composed of Cr1/3TaS2 and Fe1/4TaS2 with a native Ta2O5 oxide\ntunnel barrier in between exhibits tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), revealing\npossible spin injection and detection with these exfoliatable ferromagnetic\nmaterials through the vdW junction.\n", "  The cosmological constant problem has become one of the most important ones\nin modern cosmology. In this paper, we try to construct a model that can avoid\nthe cosmological constant problem and have the potential to explain the\napparent late-time accelerating expansion of the universe in both luminosity\ndistance and angular diameter distance measurement channels. In our model, the\ncore is to modify the relation between cosmological redshift and scale factor\nfor photons. We point out three ways to test our hypothesis: the supernova time\ndilation; the gravitational waves and its electromagnetic counterparts emitted\nby the binary neutron star systems; and the Sandage--Loeb effect. All of this\nmethod is feasible now or in the near future.\n", "  Carbon fibers, especially those constructed from carbon nanotubes (CNTs),\nhave attracted intensive interests from both scientific and engineering\ncommunities due to their outstanding physical properties. In this workHere we\nreport, we find that the recently synthesized recently synthesized ultrathin\ndiamond nanothread (DNT) not only possesses excellent torsional deformation\ncapability, but also has excellent interfacial load transfer efficiency.\nComparing with the (10,10) carbon nanotube bundles, (1) By considering a seven\nstrand fiber, the flattening of nanotubes as observed in (10,10) CNT bundles is\nnot observed in DNTdiamond nanothread bundle, which . This endows the DNT\nbundle withleads to a high torsional elastic limit that is almost three times\nhigherfour times as obtained from the (10,10) CNT bundle. Pull-out tests reveal\nthat (2) Pull-out tests reveal that tthe DNT diamond nanothread bundle has has\nan interface transfer load of more than twice that of the CNT carbon naontube\nbundle, corresponding to an order of magnitude higher in terms of . (3) Tthe\ninterfacial shear strength of the DNT bundle is an order of magnitude higher\nthan that of the CNT bundle. Such high interface load transfer efficiency is\nattributed to the zigzag morphology of DNT, which introduces a strong\nmechanical interlocking effect at the interface through the stick-slip motion\n(totally different from the load transfer mechanism in CNT bundle). The\naforementioned three aspects are commonly used to gauge the performance of\nfibers. Obviously,These intriguing features enable DNT diamond nanothread as\nexhibits excellent potential candidate for constructing next generation carbon\nfibers.\n", "  Advancement of nanotechnology has greatly accelerated the miniaturization of\nmechanical or electronic devices. This work proposes a new nanoscale spring - a\ngraphene nanoribbon-based helicoid (GH) structure by using large-scale\nmolecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the GH structure not only\npossesses an extraordinary high tensile deformation capability, but also\nexhibits unique features not accessible from traditional springs. Specifically,\nits yield strain increases when its inner radius is enlarged, which can exceed\n1000%, and it has three elastic deformation stages including the initial\ndelamination, stable delamination and elastic deformation. Moreover, the\nfailure of the GH is found to be governed by the failure of graphene nanoribbon\nand the inner edge atoms absorb most of the tensile strain energy. Such fact\nleads to a constant elastic limit force (corresponding to the yield point) for\nall GHs. This study has provided a comprehensive understanding of the tensile\nbehaviors of GH, which opens the avenue to design novel nanoscale springs based\non 2D nanomaterials.\n", "  Penta-graphene is the name given to a novel puckered monolayer of carbon\natoms tightly packed into an inerratic pentagonal network, theoretically, which\nexhibits excellent thermal and mechanical stability and can be rolled into\npenta-graphene nanotubes (PGNTs). Herein, we perform the first simulation study\nof mechanical properties of PGNTs under uniaxial tension. In addition to\ncomparable mechanical properties with that of carbon nanotubes (CNT), it is\nfound that PGNTs possess promising extensibility with typical plastic behavior\ndue to the irreversible pentagon-to-polygon structural transformation and the\nhexagon carbon ring becomes the dominating structural motif after the\ntransformation. The plastic characteristic of PGNTs is inherent with\nstrain-rate and tube-diameter independences. Moreover, within ultimate\ntemperature (T<1100 K), tensile deformed PGNTs manifest similar phase\ntransition with an approximate transition ratio from pentagon to hexagon. The\nintrinsic insight provides a fundamental understanding of mechanic properties\nof PGNTs, which should open up a novel perspective for the design of plastic\ncarbon-based nanomaterials.\n", "  Intense spin-down flows allow one to reach high Rm in relatively small\nlaboratory setups using moderate mass of liquid metals. The spin-down flow in\ntoroidal channels was the first flow configuration used for studying dynamo\neffects in non-stationary flows. In this paper, we estimate the effect of\nsmall-scale dynamo in liquid metal spin-down flows realized in laboratory\nexperiments. Our simulations have confirmed the conclusion that the dynamo\neffects observed in the experiments done on gallium are weak -- a slight burst\nof small-scale magnetic energy arises only at the highest available rotation\nvelocity of the channel. In sodium flows, the induction effects are quite\nstrong -- an essential part of kinetic energy of sodium spin-down flows is\nconverted into magnetic energy and dissipates because of Joule heat losses. We\nhave extended our simulations beyond the capabilities of existing laboratory\nfacilities and examined the spin-down flows at the channel rotation velocity\nOmega>> 50 rps. It has been found that $\\Omega\\approx 100$rps is enough to\nreach the equipartition of magnetic and kinetic spectral power density at the\nlowest wave numbers (largest scales), whereas at Omega >= 200rps the intensity\nof the magnetic field becomes comparable to the intensity of velocity field\nfluctuations. We have also studied the influence of the Pm on the efficiency of\nsmall-scale dynamo in spin-down flows. In the experimental spin-down flows, the\nsmall-scale dynamo remains in a quasi-kinematic regime, and magnetic energy is\nmainly dissipated at the same scale, wherein it is converted from kinetic\nenergy. The real small-scale dynamo starts to operate at Pm>10^{-4}, and the\ninertial range of the magnetic energy spectrum appears. Thereupon the energy\ndissipation is postponed to a later time and smaller scales, and the peak of\nturbulent energy (both kinetic and magnetic) slightly increases with Pm.\n", "  We study how much the efficiency of a solar cell as a quantum heat engine\ncould be enhanced by quantum coherence. In contrast to the conventional\napproach that a quantum heat engine is in thermal equilibrium with both hot and\ncold reservoirs, we propose a new description that the quantum heat engine is\nin the cold reservoir and the thermal radiation from the hot reservoir is\ndescribed by the pumping term in the master equation. This pumping term solves\nthe problem of the incorrect mean photon number of the hot reservoir assumed by\nthe previous studies. By solving the master equation, we obtain the\ncurrent-voltage and the power-voltage curves of the photocell for different\npumping rates. We find that, as the photon flux increases, the power output of\nthe photocell increases linearly at first and then becomes saturated, but the\nefficiency decreases rapidly. It is demonstrated that while the power output is\nenhanced significantly by the quantum coherence via the dark state of the\ncoupled donors, the improvement of the efficiency is not significant.\n", "  In this article, we present a Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) QCD analysis to\nstudy the role and influence of different schemes on simultaneous determination\nof the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and strong coupling,\n$\\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$. We perform our analysis based on three different data sets,\nHERA I and II combined data, H1-ZEUS charm combined data, and H1 and ZEUS\nbeauty production cross sections data, in two different Thorne-Roberts (TR or\nRT) and Thorne-Roberts Optimal (RT OPT) schemes. We show in going from RT\nscheme to RT OPT scheme, in addition of reduction the uncertainty of some PDFs,\nspecially for the gluon distribution, we get $\\sim 0.4$~\\% and $\\sim\n0.7$~\\%~improvement in the fit quality and $\\sim 0.9$~\\% and $\\sim\n1.6$~\\%~improvement for the strong coupling, $\\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$, without and\nwith heavy flavor contributions, respectively.\n", "  We report on EPPS16 - the first analysis of NLO nuclear PDFs where LHC p-Pb\ndata (Z, W, dijets) have been directly used as a constraint. In comparison to\nour previous fit EPS09, also data from neutrino-nucleus deeply-inelastic\nscattering and pion-nucleus Drell-Yan process are now included. Much of the\ntheory framework has also been updated from EPS09, including a consistent\ntreatment of heavy quarks in deeply-inelastic scattering. However, the most\nnotable change is that we no longer assume flavour-blind nuclear modifications\nfor valence and sea quarks. This significantly reduces the theoretical bias.\nAll the analysed data are well reproduced and the analysis thereby supports the\nvalidity of collinear factorization in high-energy collisions involving heavy\nnuclei. However, flavour by flavour, the uncertainties are still rather large.\n", "  We consider the production of inclusive W bosons in variety of high-energy\nhadronic collisions: p--p, p--$\\overline{\\rm p}$, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb. In\nparticular, we focus on the resulting distributions of charged leptons from W\ndecay that can be measured with relatively low backgrounds. The leading-order\nexpressions within the collinearly factorized QCD indicate that the\ncenter-of-mass energy dependence at forward/backward rapidities should be well\napproximated by a simple power law. The scaling exponent is related to the\nsmall-$x$ behaviour of the quark distributions, which is largely driven by the\nparton evolution. An interesting consequence is the simple scaling law for the\nlepton charge asymmetry which relates measurements in different collision\nsystems. The expectations are contrasted with the existing data and a very good\noverall agreement is found. Finally, we propose precision observables to be\nmeasured at the LHC.\n", "  The first results presented in our article are the clear definitions of both\nintrinsic and extrinsic discrete curvatures in terms of holonomy and\nplane-angle representation, a clear relation with their deficit angles, and\ntheir clear geometrical interpretations in the first order discrete geometry.\nThe second results are the discrete version of Bianchi identity and\nGauss-Codazzi equation, together with their geometrical interpretations. It\nturns out that the discrete Bianchi identity and Gauss-Codazzi equation, at\nleast in 3-dimension, could be derived from the dihedral angle formula of a\ntetrahedron, while the dihedral angle relation itself is the spherical law of\ncosine in disguise. Furthermore, the continuous infinitesimal curvature 2-form,\nthe standard Bianchi identity, and Gauss-Codazzi equation could be recovered in\nthe continuum limit.\n", "  The non-linear induction problem in an infinite ferromagnetic pate is studied\ntheoretically by means of the truncated region eigenfunction expansion (TREE)\nfor the 2D case. The non-linear formulation is linearised using a fixed-point\niterative scheme, and the solution of the resulting linear problem is\nconstructed in the Fourier domain following the TREE formalism. The calculation\nis carried out for the steady-state response under harmonic excitation and the\nharmonic distortion is derived from the obtained spectrum. This article is\nmeant to be the theoretical part of a study, which will be complemented by the\ncorresponding experimental work in a future communication.\n", "  The paper proposes a simple and efficient method to study the dielectric\nproperties of composite materials modeled using very large random\nresistor-capacitor (RC) networks. The algorithm is based on the Frank-Lobb\nreduction scheme and analyses the frequency dependent AC conductivity,\npermittivity and phase angle of composite materials. The simulation study is\nbased on 1056 samples of random network containing 2*10^6 components randomly\npositioned in different proportion of capacitors. It has been found that these\nproperties exhibit similarities to the universal dielectric response of\ndielectric materials. The results show that there is no variability between\nsamples at low and high frequencies and across the power law.\n", "  Transport in nonequilibrium degenerate quantum systems is investigated.\nTransfer rate depends on parameters of the system. In this paper we investigate\ndependence of the flow (transfer rate) on the angle between \"bright\" vectors\n(which define interaction of the system with the environment). We show that in\nsome approximation for the system under investigation the flow is proportional\nto cosine squared of the angle between \"bright\" vectors. Earlier in\narXiv:1603.07182 it was shown that in this degenerate quantum system excitation\nof non-decaying quantum \"dark\" states is possible, moreover the effectiveness\nof this process is proportional to sine squared of the angle between \"bright\"\nvectors (this phenomenon was discussed as a possible model of excitation of\nquantum coherences in quantum photosynthesis). Thus quantum transport and\nexcitation of dark states are competing processes, dark states can be\nconsidered as a result of leakage of quantum states in quantum thermodynamic\nmachine which performs the quantum transport.\n", "  Spin-1 hadrons have additional structure functions not present for spin 1/2\nhadrons. These could probe novel aspects of hadron structure and QCD dynamics.\nFor the deuteron, the tensor structure function $b_1$ inherently mixes quark\nand nuclear degrees of freedom. These proceedings discuss two standard\nconvolution models applied to calculations of the deuteron $b_1$ structure\nfunctions. We find large differences with the existing HERMES data and other\nconvolution model calculations. This leaves room for non-standard contributions\nto $b_1$ in the deuteron. We also discuss the influence of higher twist nuclear\neffects in the model calculations and data extraction at kinematics covered in\nHERMES and Jefferson Lab.\n", "  We study the impact of recent measurements of charm cross section H1-ZEUS\ncombined data on simultaneous determination of parton distribution functions\n(PDFs) and the strong coupling, $\\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$, in two different schemes. We\nperform several fits based on Thorne-Roberts (RT) and Thorne-Roberts optimal\n(RTOPT) schemes at next-to-leading order (NLO). We show that adding charm cross\nsection H1-ZEUS combined data reduces the uncertainty of the gluon distribution\nand improves the fit quality up to $\\sim 0.4$~\\% and $\\sim 0.9$~\\%~, without\nand with the charm contribution, from the RT scheme to the RTOPT scheme,\nrespectively. We also emphasise the central role of the strong coupling,\n$\\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$, in revealing the impact of charm flavour contribution, when\nit is considered as an extra free parameter. We show that in going from the RT\nscheme to the RT OPT scheme, we get $\\sim 0.9$~\\% and $\\sim 2.0$~\\%~improvement\nin the value of $\\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$, without and with the charm flavour\ncontribution respectively.\n", "  Online algorithm is a well-known computational model. We introduce quantum\nonline algorithms and investigate them with respect to a competitive ratio in\ntwo points of view: space complexity and advice complexity. We start with\nexploring a model with restricted memory and show that quantum online\nalgorithms can be better than classical ones (deterministic or randomized) for\nsublogarithmic space (memory), and they can be better than deterministic online\nalgorithms without restriction for memory. Additionally, we consider\npolylogarithmic space case and show that in this case, quantum online\nalgorithms can be better than deterministic ones as well.\n", "  We propose a method for confirmation of the existence of Population III (Pop\nIII) stars with massive black hole binaries as GW150914 in gravitational wave\n(GW) observation. When we get enough number of events, we want to determine\nwhich model is closer to reality, with and without Pop III stars. We need to\nprepare various \"Pop I/II models\" and various \"Pop I/II/III models\" and\ninvestigate which model is consistent with the events. To demonstrate our\nanalysis, we simulate detections of GW events for some examples of population\nsynthesis models with and without Pop III stars. We calculate the likelihood\nratio with the realistic number of events and evaluate the probability of\nidentifying the existence of Pop III stars. In typical cases, our analysis can\ndistinguish between Pop I/II model and Pop I/II/III model with 90% probability\nby 22 GW signals from black hole-black hole binary mergers.\n", "  Erosion and deposition during flow through porous media can lead to large\nerosive bursts that manifest as jumps in permeability and pressure loss. Here\nwe reveal that the cause of these bursts is the re-opening of clogged pores\nwhen the pressure difference between two opposite sites of the pore surpasses a\ncertain threshold. We perform numerical simulations of flow through porous\nmedia and compare our predictions to experimental results, recovering with\nexcellent agreement shape and power-law distribution of pressure loss jumps,\nand the behavior of the permeability jumps as function of particle\nconcentration. Furthermore, we find that erosive bursts only occur for pressure\ngradient thresholds within the range of two critical values, independent on how\nthe flow is driven. Our findings provide a better understanding of sudden sand\nproduction in oil wells and breakthrough in filtration.\n", "  MHONGOOSE is a deep survey of the neutral hydrogen distribution in a\nrepresentative sample of 30 nearby disk and dwarf galaxies with HI masses from\n10^6 to ~10^{11} M_sun, and luminosities from M_R ~ -12 to M_R ~ -22. The\nsample is selected to uniformly cover the available range in log(M_HI). Our\nextremely deep observations, down to HI column density limits of well below\n10^{18} cm^{-2} - or a few hundred times fainter than the typical HI disks in\ngalaxies - will directly detect the effects of cold accretion from the\nintergalactic medium and the links with the cosmic web. These observations will\nbe the first ever to probe the very low-column density neutral gas in galaxies\nat these high resolutions. Combination with data at other wavelengths, most of\nit already available, will enable accurate modelling of the properties and\nevolution of the mass components in these galaxies and link these with the\neffects of environment, dark matter distribution, and other fundamental\nproperties such as halo mass and angular momentum. MHONGOOSE can already start\naddressing some of the SKA-1 science goals and will provide a comprehensive\ninventory of the processes driving the transformation and evolution of galaxies\nin the nearby universe at high resolution and over 5 orders of magnitude in\ncolumn density. It will be a Nearby Galaxies Legacy Survey that will be\nunsurpassed until the advent of the SKA, and can serve as a highly visible,\nlasting statement of MeerKAT's capabilities.\n", "  In the Bak-Sneppen model, the lowest fitness particle and its two nearest\nneighbors are renewed at each temporal step with a uniform (0,1) fitness\ndistribution. The model presents a critical value that depends on the\ninteraction criteria (two nearest neighbors) and on the update procedure\n(uniform). Here we calculate the critical value for models where one or both\nproperties are changed. We study models with non-uniform updates, models with\nrandom neighbors and models with binary fitness and obtain exact results for\nthe average fitness and for $p_c$.\n", "  English: Solar eruptive events affect the close neighbourhood of the Earth.\nThey also affect human infrastructure, power grids mainly, due to the induction\nof electrical currents. Only recently the attention was drawn not only to large\nflares, but also to estimate the long-term effects of increased solar activity\nby statistical methods. We analyse the failure rates in the main Czech power\ntransmission system operated by the Czech national operator \\v{C}EPS. We show\nthat the effects of solar activity on failure rate in the main Czech power grid\ncannot be excluded even for central-european country.

Prior work has focused on\ntracking daily logs of outdoor mobility without considering relevant context,\nwhich contain a mixture of regular and irregular human movement for a range of\npurposes, and thus diverse effects on the dynamics have been ignored. This\nstudy aims to focus on irregular human movement of different meta-populations\nwith various purposes. We propose approaches to estimate the predictability of\nmobility in different contexts. With our survey data from international and\ndomestic visitors to Australia, we found that the travel patterns of Europeans\nvisiting for holidays are less predictable than those visiting for education,\nwhile East Asian visitors show the opposite patterns, ie, more predictable for\nholidays than for education. Domestic residents from the most populous\nAustralian states exhibit the most unpredictable patterns, while visitors from\nless populated states show the highest predictable movement.\n", "  While conventional shared demand-responsive transportation (SDRT) systems\nmostly operate on a door-to-door policy, the usage of meeting points for the\npick-up and drop-off of user groups can offer several advantages, like fewer\nstops and less total travelled mileage. Moreover, it offers the possibility to\nselect only feasible and well-defined locations where a safe (de-)boarding is\npossible. This paper presents a three-step workflow for solving the SDRT\nproblem with meeting points (SDRT-MP). Firstly, the customers are clustered\ninto similar groups, then meeting (and divergence) points are determined for\neach cluster. Finally, a parallel neighbourhood search algorithm is applied to\ncreate the vehicle routes. Further, a simulation with realistic pick-up and\ndrop-off locations based on map data is performed in order to demonstrate the\nimpact of using meeting points for SDRT systems in contrast to the door-to-door\nservice. Although the average passenger travel time is higher due to enhanced\nwalking and waiting times, the experiment highlights a reduction of operator\nresources required to serve all customers.\n", "  Drivers offering spare seats in their vehicles on long-distance (interurban)\ntrips often have to pick up or drop off passengers in cities en route. In that\ncase it is necessary to agree on a meeting point. Often, this is done by\nproposing well-known locations like train stations, which frequently induces\nunnecessary detours through the inner-city districts. In contrast, meeting\npoints in the vicinity of motorways and arterial roads with good public\ntransport connection can reduce driving time and mileage. This work proposes a\nlocation-based approach to enable a fast and automatic recommendation of\nsuitable pick-up (and drop-off) points for drivers and passengers using a GIS\nworkflow and comprehensive precomputation of travel times.\n", "  In this article we present pictorially the foundation of differential\ngeometry which is a crucial tool for multiple areas of physics, notably general\nand special relativity, but also mechanics, thermodynamics and solving\ndifferential equations. As all the concepts are presented as pictures, there\nare no equations in this article. As such this article may be read by\npre-university students who enjoy physics, mathematics and geometry. However it\nwill also greatly aid the intuition of an undergraduate and masters students,\nlearning general relativity and similar courses. It concentrates on the tools\nneeded to understand Maxwell's equations thus leading to the goal of presenting\nMaxwell's equations as 3 pictures.\n", "  K-line profiles emitted from a warm dense plasma environment are used for\ndiagnostics of Ar droplet plasmas created by high energy laser pulses.\nAnalyzing the temporally and spacially integrated spectra, we infer temperature\ngradients within the Ar droplet from cold temperatures of the order of some 10\neV up to higher temperatures of 250 eV and beyond. To characterize the\ninfluence of the warm and dense environment on the emitters, plasma screening\nis considered within a perturbative approach to the Hamiltonian. The plasma\naffects the many-particle system resulting in energy shifts of emission as well\nas ionization energies due to electron-ion and electron-electron interaction.\nWith this approach we get a good reproduction of spectral features that are\nstrongly influenced by ionization and excitation processes within the plasma.\nComparing with the widely known FLYCHK code and the temperature distribution\ngiven in the original paper, counting for internal degrees of freedom (bound\nstates) and treating pressure ionization within our quantum statistical\napproach results in a more detailed temperature-density-relation and leads to\ndifferent results for the inferred temperature distribution.\n", "  Hamilton's Ricci flow (RF) equations were recently expressed in terms of a\nsparsely-coupled system of autonomous first-order nonlinear differential\nequations for the edge lengths of a d-dimensional piecewise linear (PL)\nsimplicial geometry. More recently, this system of discrete Ricci flow (DRF)\nequations was further simplified by explicitly constructing the Forman-Ricci\ntensor associated to each edge, thereby diagonalizing the first-order\ndifferential operator and avoiding the need to invert large sparse matrices at\neach time step. We recently showed analytically and numerically that these\nequations converge for axisymmetric 3-geometries to the corresponding continuum\nRF equations. We demonstrate here that these DRF equations yield an explicit\nnumerical realization of Thurston's geometrization procedure for a discrete 3D\naxially-symmetric neckpinch geometry by using surgery to explicitly integrate\nthrough its Type-1 neck pinch singularity. A cubic-spline-based adaptive mesh\nwas required to complete the evolution. Our numerically efficient simulations\nyield the expected Thurston decomposition of the sufficiently pinched axially\nsymmetric geometry into its unique geometric structure -- a direct product of\ntwo lobes, each collapsing toward a 3-sphere geometry. The structure of our\ncurvature may be used to better inform one of the vertex and edge weighting\nfactors that appear in the Forman's expression of Ricci curvature on graphs.\n", "  Over the last years, machine learning tools have been successfully applied to\na wealth of problems in high-energy physics. A typical example is the\nclassification of physics objects. Supervised machine learning methods allow\nfor significant improvements in classification problems by taking into account\nobservable correlations and by learning the optimal selection from examples,\ne.g. from Monte Carlo simulations. Even more promising is the usage of deep\nlearning techniques. Methods like deep convolutional networks might be able to\ncatch features from low-level parameters that are not exploited by default\ncut-based methods.\n  These ideas could be particularly beneficial for measurements in heavy-ion\ncollisions, because of the very large multiplicities. Indeed, machine learning\nmethods potentially perform much better in systems with a large number of\ndegrees of freedom compared to cut-based methods. Moreover, many key heavy-ion\nobservables are most interesting at low transverse momentum where the\nunderlying event is dominant and the signal-to-noise ratio is quite low.\n  In this work, recent developments of machine- and deep learning applications\nin heavy-ion collisions with ALICE will be presented, with focus on a deep\nlearning-based b-jet tagging approach and the measurement of low-mass\ndielectrons. While the b-jet tagger is based on a mixture of shallow\nfully-connected and deep convolutional networks, the low-mass dielectron\nmeasurement uses gradient boosting and shallow neural networks. Both methods\nare very promising compared to default cut-based methods.\n", "  It is shown that the dark energy presently observed in our universe can be\nregarded as the energy of a scalar field driving an inflation-like expansion of\na multiverse with ours being a subuniverse among other parallel universes. A\nsimple model of this multiverse is elaborated: Assuming closed space geometry,\nthe origin of the multiverse can be explained by quantum tunneling from\nnothing; subuniverses are supposed to emerge from local fluctuations of\nseparate inflation fields. The standard concept of tunneling from nothing is\nextended to the effect that in addition to an inflationary scalar field, matter\nis also generated, and that the tunneling leads to an (unstable) equilibrium\nstate. The cosmological principle is assumed to pertain from the origin of the\nmultiverse until the first subuniverses emerge. With increasing age of the\nmultiverse, its spatial curvature decays exponentially so fast that, due to\nsharing the same space, the flatness problem of our universe resolves by\nitself. The dark energy density imprinted by the multiverse on our universe is\ntime-dependent, but such that the ratio $w{=}\\varrho/(c^2p)$ of its mass\ndensity and pressure (times $c^2$) is time-independent and assumes a value\n$-1{+}\\epsilon$ with arbitrary $\\epsilon{>}0$. $\\epsilon$ can be chosen so\nsmall, that the dark energy model of this paper can be fitted to the current\nobservational data as well as the cosmological constant model.\n", "  The magnetic transition-metal (TM) @ oxide nanoparticles have been of great\ninterest due to their wide range of applications, from medical sensors in\nmagnetic resonance imaging to photo-catalysis. Although several studies on\nsmall clusters of TM@oxide have been reported, the understanding of the\nphysical electronic properties of TMn@(ZnO)42 is far from sufficient. In this\nwork, the electronic, magnetic and optical properties of TMn@(ZnO)42 (TM = Fe,\nCo and Ni) hetero-nanostructure are investigated using the density functional\ntheory (DFT). It has been found that the core-shell nanostructure Fe13@(ZnO)42,\nCo15@(ZnO)42 and Ni15@(ZnO)42 are the most stable structures. Moreover, it is\nalso predicted that the variation of the magnetic moment and magnetism of Fe,\nCo and Ni in TMn@ZnO42 hetero-nanostructure mainly stems from effective\nhybridization between core TM-3d orbitals and shell O-2p orbitals, and a\nmagnetic moment inversion for Fe15@(ZnO)42 is investigated. Finally, optical\nproperties studied by calculations show a red shift phenomenon in the\nabsorption spectrum compared with the case of (ZnO)48.\n", "  We consider an analytic approach to the elucidation of the role played by\nCoulomb interaction in the formation of the spectrum and angular distributions\nof the electrons produced by above threshold ionization of the atoms. Our\napproach is based on allowance for the multiple scattering of a photoelectron\nby the Coulomb potential of the residual ion, with pickup of a field photon in\neach scattering act. The amplitude of a process with direct ionization of the\natom and subsequent scattering of the photoelectron in the continuum by the\nCoulomb potential of the residual ion are found.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to review and compare the spectral properties of\n(the closed extension of) --$\\Delta$ + U (V $\\ge$ 0) and --$\\Delta$ + iV in L 2\n(R^d) for C $\\infty$ real potentials U or V with polynomial behavior. The case\nwith magnetic field will be also considered. More precisely, we would like to\npresent the existing criteria for: $\\bullet$ essential selfadjointness or\nmaximal accretivity $\\bullet$ Compactness of the resolvent. $\\bullet$ Maximal\ninequalities, i.e. the existence of C > 0 such that, $\\forall$u $\\in$\nC^$\\infty$\\_0 (R ^d), ||u||^2 \\_{H^2 (R^d)} + ||U u||^2 \\_{L^2 (R^d)}$\\le$ C\n||(--$\\Delta$ + U)u||^2\\_{L^2 (R^d)} + ||u||^2\\_{L^2 (R^d)}or similar estimates\nfor $-\\Delta + i V$.\n", "  A clustering algorithm is applied to Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem\ncontinuum and methane band images of Saturns northern hemisphere to objectively\nclassify regional albedo features and aid in their dynamical interpretation.\nThe procedure is based on a technique applied previously to visible-infrared\nimages of Earth. It provides a new perspective on giant planet cloud morphology\nand its relationship to the dynamics and a meteorological context for the\nanalysis of other types of simultaneous Saturn observations. The method\nidentifies six clusters that exhibit distinct morphology, vertical structure,\nand preferred latitudes of occurrence. These correspond to areas dominated by\ndeep convective cells; low contrast areas, some including thinner and thicker\nclouds possibly associated with baroclinic instability; regions with possible\nisolated thin cirrus clouds; darker areas due to thinner low level clouds or\nclearer skies due to downwelling, or due to absorbing particles; and fields of\nrelatively shallow cumulus clouds. The spatial associations among these cloud\ntypes suggest that dynamically, there are three distinct types of latitude\nbands on Saturn: deep convectively disturbed latitudes in cyclonic shear\nregions poleward of the eastward jets; convectively suppressed regions near and\nsurrounding the westward jets; and baroclinically unstable latitudes near\neastward jet cores and in the anti-cyclonic regions equatorward of them. These\nare roughly analogous to some of the features of Earths tropics, subtropics,\nand midlatitudes, respectively. Temporal variations of feature contrast and\ncluster occurrence suggest that the upper tropospheric haze in the northern\nhemisphere may have thickened by 2014.\n", "  Annihilating dark matter particles in nearby subhalos could generate\npotentially observable fluxes of gamma rays, unaccompanied by emission at other\nwavelengths. Furthermore, this gamma-ray emission is expected to be spatially\nextended, providing us with a powerful way to discriminate dark matter subhalos\nfrom other astrophysical gamma-ray sources. Fermi has detected two dark matter\nsubhalo candidates which exhibit a statistically significant degree of spatial\nextension (3FGL J2212.5+0703 and 3FGL J1924.8-1034). It has been argued that\nthe most likely non-dark matter interpretation of these observations is that\nthey are each in fact multiple nearby point sources, too close to one another\non the sky to be individually resolved. In this study, we consider the ability\nof next generation gamma-ray telescopes to spatially resolve the gamma-ray\nemission from subhalo candidates, focusing on the proposed e-ASTROGAM mission.\nWe find that such an instrument could significantly clarify the nature of\nFermi's dark matter subhalo candidates, and provide an unprecedented level of\nsensitivity to the presence of annihilating dark matter in nearby subhalos.\n", "  A disordered array of metal grains with large and random intergrain\nconductances is studied within the one-loop accuracy renormalization group\napproach. While at low level of disorder the dependence of conductivity on log\nT is nonuniversal (it depends on details of the array's geometry), for strong\ndisorder this dependence is described by a universal nonlinear function, which\ndepends only on the array's dimensionality. In two dimensions this function is\nfound numerically. The dimensional crossover in granular films is discussed.\n"]}
