These properties are encoded in the `constitutive\ntensor of the vacuum', a quantity analogous to that used in the description of\nmaterial media. We give a generally covariant derivation of the Fresnel\nequation describing the local properties of the propagation of electromagnetic\nwaves for the case of the most general possible linear constitutive tensor. We\nalso study the particular case in which a light cone structure is induced and\nthe circumstances under which such a structure emerges. In particular, we will\nstudy the relationship between the dual operators defined by the constitutive\ntensor under certain conditions and the existence of a conformal metric.\nClosure and symmetry of the constitutive tensor will be found as conditions\nwhich ensure the existence of a conformal metric. We will also see how the\nmetric components can be explicitly deduced from the constitutive tensor if\nthese two conditions are met. Finally, we will apply the same method to explore\nthe consequences of relaxing the condition of symmetry and how this affects the\nemergence of the light cone.\n", "  Investigating electronic structure and excitations under extreme conditions\ngives access to a rich variety of phenomena. High pressure typically induces\nbehavior such as magnetic collapse and the insulator-metal transition in 3d\ntransition metals compounds, valence fluctuations or Kondo-like characteristics\nin $f$-electron systems, and coordination and bonding changes in molecular\nsolids and glasses. This article reviews research concerning electronic\nexcitations in materials under extreme conditions using inelastic x-ray\nscattering (IXS). IXS is a spectroscopic probe of choice for this study because\nof its chemical and orbital selectivity and the richness of information it\nprovides. Being an all-photon technique, IXS has a penetration depth compatible\nwith high pressure requirements. Electronic transitions under pressure in 3d\ntransition metals compounds and $f$-electron systems, most of them strongly\ncorrelated, are reviewed. Implications for geophysics are mentioned. Since the\nincident X-ray energy can easily be tuned to absorption edges, resonant IXS,\noften employed, is discussed at length. Finally studies involving local\nstructure changes and electronic transitions under pressure in materials\ncontaining light elements are briefly reviewed.\n", "  We investigate the composition of the solid-state materials in the winds\naround S-type AGB stars. The S stars produce dust in their wind that bears a\nresemblance to the dust produced in some O-rich AGB stars. However, the\nreported resemblance is mostly based on IRAS/LRS spectra with limited spectral\nresolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage. We investigate the dust\ncomposition around S stars using ISO/SWS data that surpass the previous studies\nin terms of spectral resolution and wavelength coverage. We compare the dust\nspectra from the 9 sources with the O-rich AGB spectra and a subset of M\nsuper-giants. We constructed average dust emission spectra of the different\ncategories. We report the discovery of several previously unreported dust\nemission features in the S star spectra. The long wavelength spectra of W Aql\nand pi1 Gru exhibit the \"30\" micrometer feature attributed to MgS. Two sources\nexhibit a series of emission bands between 20 and 40 micrometer that we\ntentatively ascribe to Diopside. We show that the 10-20 micrometer spectra of\nthe S stars are significantly different from the O-rich AGB stars. The O-rich\nstars exhibit a structured emission feature that is believed to arise from\namorphous silicate and aluminium-oxide. The S stars lack the substructure found\nin the O-rich stars. Instead they show a smooth peak with a varying\npeak-position from source to source. We suggest that this feature is caused by\na family of related material, whose exact composition determines the peak\nposition. The observed trend mimics the laboratory trend of non-stoichiometric\nsilicates. In this scenario the degree of non-stoichiometry is related to the\nMg to SiO4 ratio, in other words, to the amount of free O available during the\ndust grain growth.\n", "  Here show that, pure affine actions based solely on the Riemann curvature\ntensor lead to Einstein field equations for gravitation. The matter and\nradiation involved are general enough to impose no restrictions on material\ndynamics or vacuum structure. This dynamical equivalence to General Relativity\ncan be realized via also diffeomorphism breaking.\n", "  We present the first study of codoped iron-arsenide superconductors of the\n122 family (Sr/Ba)_(1-x)K_xFe_(2-y)Co_yAs_2 with the purpose to increase the\nupper critical field H_c2 compared to single doped (Sr/Ba)Fe_2As_2 materials.\nH_c2 was investigated by measuring the magnetoresistance in high pulsed\nmagnetic fields up to 64 T. We find, that H_c2 extrapolated to T = 0 is indeed\nenhanced significantly to ~ 90 T for polycrystalline samples of\nBa_0.55K_0.45Fe_1.95Co_0.05As_2 compared to ~75 T for Ba_0.55K_0.45Fe_2As_2 and\nBaFe_1.8Co_0.2As_2 single crystals. Codoping thus is a promising way for the\nsystematic optimization of iron-arsenic based superconductors for\nmagnetic-field and high-current applications.\n", "  We present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of the\nthermodynamic properties: specific heat, magnetization and thermal expansion in\nthe vicinity of the field-induced quantum critical point (QCP) around the lower\ncritical field $H_{c1} \\approx 2$\\,T in DTN . A $T^{3/2}$ behavior in the\nspecific heat and magnetization is observed at very low temperatures at\n$H=H_{c1}$ that is consistent with the universality class of Bose-Einstein\ncondensation of magnons. The temperature dependence of the thermal expansion\ncoefficient at $H_{c1}$ shows minor deviations from the expected $T^{1/2}$\nbehavior. Our experimental study is complemented by analytical calculations and\nQuantum Monte Carlo simulations, which reproduce nicely the measured\nquantities. We analyze the thermal and the magnetic Gr\\\"{u}neisen parameters\nthat are ideal quantities to identify QCPs. Both parameters diverge at $H_{c1}$\nwith the expected $T^{-1}$ power law. By using the Ehrenfest relations at the\nsecond order phase transition, we are able to estimate the pressure\ndependencies of the characteristic temperature and field scales.\n", "  Cluster states are an essential component in one-way quantum computation\nprotocols. We present two schemes to generate addressable continuous-variable\ncluster states from quadrature squeezed cylindrically polarized modes. By\nincluding polarization in addition to the transverse spatial degree of freedom,\nelementary cluster states can be created in which four cluster nodes\nco-propagate within one paraxial vector beam. This approach is fundamentally\ncompatible with existing time-multiplexed schemes that have been used to create\nthe largest cluster states to date. We implement a proof-of-principle\nexperiment of one of the proposed schemes and verify its feasibility by\nmeasuring the quantum correlations between the different nodes of the cluster\nstate.\n", "  A two-dimensional energy-based model of fragmentation of rapidly expanding\ncylinder under plane strain conditions is proposed. The model allows us to\nestimate the average fragment length and the number of fragments produced by\nductile fracture of the cylinder. Comparison of obtained results with published\nexperimental data on the fragmentation of the aluminum rings and cylinders\nshows that they are in good agreement.\n", "  We study the impact of higher order quark-meson scattering processes on the\nchiral phase structure of two-flavour QCD at finite temperature and quark\ndensity. Thermal, density and quantum fluctuations are included within a\nfunctional renormalisation group approach to the quark-meson model. We present\nresults on the chiral phase boundary, the critical endpoint, and the curvature\nof the phase transition line at vanishing density.\n", "  In this work the multifractal analysis of the kinesiological surface\nelectromyographic signal is proposed. The goal was to investigate the level of\nneuromuscular activation during complex movements on the laparoscopic trainer.\nThe basic issue of this work concerns the changes observed in the signal\nobtained from the complete beginner in the field of using laparoscopic tools\nand the same person subjected to the series of training. To quantify the\ncomplexity of the kinesiological sEMG, the nonlinear analysis technique, namely\nthe MultiFractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis was adopted. The analysis was\nbased on the parameters describing the multifractal spectrum -- Hurst exponent\nand the spectrum width. The statistically significant differences for a\nselected group of muscles at the different states (before and after training)\nare presented. Additionally, as the base case, the relaxation state was\nconsidered and compared with the working states.\n", "  These notes summarize two different connections between two discrete\nintegrable systems, the $A_d$ $T$-system and its infinite-rank analog, the\noctahedron relation, and the pentagram map and its various generalizations.\n", "  We have constructed a series of non-rotating quasi-hydrostatic evolutionary\nmodels for the M2 Iab supergiant Betelgeuse ($\\alpha~Orionis$). Our models are\nconstrained by multiple observed values for the temperature, luminosity,\nsurface composition and mass loss for this star, along with the parallax\ndistance and high resolution imagery that determines its radius. We have then\napplied our best-fit models to analyze the observed variations in surface\nluminosity and the size of detected surface bright spots as the result of\nup-flowing convective material from regions of high temperature in the surface\nconvective zone. We also attempt to explain the intermittently observed\nperiodic variability in a simple radial linear adiabatic pulsation model. Based\nupon the best fit to all observed data, we suggest a best progenitor mass\nestimate of $ 20 ^{+5}_{-3} M_\\odot$ and a current age from the start of the\nzero-age main sequence of $8.0 - 8.5$ Myr based upon the observed ejected mass\nwhile on the giant branch.\n", "  We present a new scheme for the compression of one-way quantum messages, in\nthe setting of coherent entanglement assisted quantum communication. For this,\nwe present a new technical tool that we call the convex split lemma, which is\ninspired by the classical compression schemes that use rejection sampling\nprocedure. As a consequence, we show new bounds on the quantum communication\ncost of single-shot entanglement-assisted one-way quantum state redistribution\ntask and for the sub-tasks quantum state splitting and quantum state merging.\nOur upper and lower bounds are tight up to a constant and hence stronger than\npreviously known best bounds for above tasks. Our protocols use explicit\nquantum operations on the sides of Alice and Bob, which are different from the\ndecoupling by random unitaries approach used in previous works. As another\napplication, we present a port-based teleportation scheme which works when the\nset of input states is restricted to a known ensemble, hence potentially saving\nthe number of required ports. Furthermore, in case of no prior knowledge about\nthe set of input states, our average success fidelity matches the known average\nsuccess fidelity, providing a new port-based teleportation scheme with similar\nperformance as appears in literature.\n", "  K-line profiles emitted from a warm dense plasma environment are used for\ndiagnostics of Ar droplet plasmas created by high energy laser pulses. We\nobserve temperature gradients within the Ar droplet from cold temperatures of\nthe order of some 10 eV up to higher temperatures of about 170 eV.\nNon-perturbative wave functions are calculated as well as ionization energies,\nbinding energies and relevant emission energies using a chemical {\\it ab\ninitio} code. The plasma screening is considered within a perturbative approach\nto the Hamiltonian. The plasma effect influences the many-particle system\nresulting in energy shifts due to electron-ion and electron-electron\ninteraction. With this approach we get a good reproduction of spectral features\nthat are strongly influenced by ionization and excitation processes within the\nplasma. Comparing with the widely known FLYCHK code, counting for internal\ndegrees of freedom (bound states) and treating pressure ionization within our\nquantum statistical approach leads to different results for the inferred\ntemperature distribution.\n", "  In this Letter we study the effect of topological zero modes on entanglement\nHamiltonians and entropy of free chiral fermion systems in (1+1)d. We show how\nRiemann-Hilbert solutions combined with finite rank perturbation theory allow\nus to obtain explicit expressions for entanglement Hamiltonians. We consider\nboth chiral Majorana and Dirac fermions, and explore the effects of boundary\nconditions (periodic/anti-periodic for Majorana and generic for Dirac) and\nassociated zero modes on entanglement. In the periodic sector, we derive\nexplicitly the non-local contribution to the entanglement Hamiltonian due to\nthe zero mode, and show an exact expression for the change in entanglement\nentropy due to the zero mode.\n", "  Inspired by Barnard 68, a Bok globule, that undergoes stable oscillations, we\nperform multi-phase hydrodynamic simulations to analyze the stability of Bok\nglobules. We show that a high-density soft molecular core, with an adiabatic\nindex $\\gamma$ = 0.7 embedded in a warm isothermal diffuse gas, must have a\nsmall density gradient to retain the stability. Despite being stable, the\nmolecular core can still collapse spontaneously as it will relax to develop a\nsufficiently large density gradient after tens of oscillations, or a few $10^7$\nyears. However, during its relaxation, the core may abruptly collapse triggered\nby the impingement of small-amplitude, long-wavelength ($\\sim$ 6 $-$ 36 pc)\nsound waves in the warm gas. This triggered collapse mechanism is similar to a\nsonoluminescence phenomenon, where underwater ultrasounds can drive air bubble\ncoalescence. The collapse configuration is found to be different from both\ninside-out and outside-in models of low-mass star formation; nonetheless the\nmass flux is close to the prediction of the inside-out model. The condition and\nthe efficiency for this core collapse mechanism are identified. Generally\nspeaking, a broad-band resonance condition must be met, where the core\noscillation frequency and the wave frequency should match each other within a\nfactor of several. A consequence of our findings predicts the possibility of\npropagating low-mass star formation, for which collapse of cores, within a mass\nrange short of one order of magnitude, takes place sequentially tracing the\nwave front across a region of few tens of pc over $10^7$ years.\n", "  Introduced by the late Per Bak and his colleagues, self-organized criticality\n(SOC) has been one of the most stimulating concepts to come out of statistical\nmechanics and condensed matter theory in the last few decades, and has played a\nsignificant role in the development of complexity science. SOC, and more\ngenerally fractals and power laws, have attacted much comment, ranging from the\nvery positive to the polemical. The other papers in this special issue\n(Aschwanden et al, 2014; McAteer et al, 2014; Sharma et al, 2015) showcase the\nconsiderable body of observations in solar, magnetospheric and fusion plasma\ninspired by the SOC idea, and expose the fertile role the new paradigm has\nplayed in approaches to modeling and understanding multiscale plasma\ninstabilities. This very broad impact, and the necessary process of adapting a\nscientific hypothesis to the conditions of a given physical system, has meant\nthat SOC as studied in these fields has sometimes differed significantly from\nthe definition originally given by its creators. In Bak's own field of\ntheoretical physics there are significant observational and theoretical open\nquestions, even 25 years on (Pruessner, 2012). One aim of the present review is\nto address the dichotomy between the great reception SOC has received in some\nareas, and its shortcomings, as they became manifest in the controversies it\ntriggered. Our article tries to clear up what we think are misunderstandings of\nSOC in fields more remote from its origins in statistical mechanics, condensed\nmatter and dynamical systems by revisiting Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld's original\npapers.\n", "  For any MONDian extended theory of gravity where the rotation curves of\nspiral galaxies are explained through a change in physics rather than the\nhypothesis of dark matter, a generic dynamical behavior is expected for\npressure supported systems: an outer flattening of the velocity dispersion\nprofile occurring at a characteristic radius, where both the amplitude of this\nflat velocity dispersion and the radius at which it appears are predicted to\nshow distinct scalings with the total mass of the system. By carefully\nanalyzing the dynamics of globular clusters and elliptical galaxies, we are\nable to significantly extend the astronomical diversity of objects in which\nMONDian gravity has been tested, from spiral galaxies, to the much larger mass\nrange covered by pressure supported systems. We show that a universal projected\nvelocity dispersion profile accurately describes various classes of pressure\nsupported systems, and further, that the expectations of extended gravity are\nmet, across seven orders of magnitude in mass. These observed scalings are not\nexpected under dark matter cosmology, and would require particular explanations\ntuned at the scales of each distinct astrophysical system.\n", "  Ab initio atomic relaxations often take large numbers of steps and long times\nto converge. An atomic relaxation method based on on-the-flight force learning\nand a corresponding new curved line minimization algorithm is presented to\ndramatically accelerate this process. Results for metal clusters demonstrate\nthe significant speedup of this method compared with conventional\nconjugate-gradient method.\n", "  In this paper, we solve the problem of giving a gauge-theoretic description\nof the natural Dirac structure on a Lie Group which plays a prominent role in\nthe theory of D- branes for the Wess-Zumino-Witten model as well as the theory\nof quasi-Hamiltonian spaces. We describe the structure as an\ninfinite-dimensional reduction of the space of connections over the circle. Our\ninsight is that the formal Poisson structure on the space of connections is not\nan actual Poisson structure, but is itself a Dirac structure, due to the fact\nthat it is defined by an unbounded operator. We also develop general tools for\nreducing Courant algebroids and morphisms between them, allowing us to give a\nprecise correspondence between Hamiltonian loop group spaces and quasi-\nHamiltonian spaces.\n", "  We investigate the light quarkonium spectrum using a covariant\nDyson-Schwinger-Bethe-Salpeter-equation approach to QCD. We discuss splittings\namong as well as orbital angular momentum properties of various states in\ndetail and analyze common features of mass splittings with regard to properties\nof the effective interaction. In particular, we predict the mass of sbars\nexotic 1-+ states, and identify orbital angular momentum content in the\nexcitations of the rho meson. Comparing our covariant model results, the rho\nand its second excitation being predominantly S-wave, the first excitation\nbeing predominantly D-wave, to corresponding conflicting lattice-QCD studies,\nwe investigate the pion-mass dependence of the orbital-angular-momentum\nassignment and find a crossing at a scale of $m_\\pi$ ~ 1.4 GeV. If this\ncrossing turns out to be a feature of the spectrum generated by lattice-QCD\nstudies as well, it may reconcile the different results, since they have been\nobtained at different values of $m_\\pi$.\n", "  We report magnetization, heat capacity, 7Li - nuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR), and muSR (muon spin roration) measurements on the honeycomb 4d5 spin\nliquid candidate Li2RhO3. The magnetization in small magnetic fields provides\nevidence of the partial spin-freezing of a small fraction of Rh4+ -moments at 6\nK, whereas the Curie-Weiss behavior above 100 K suggests a pseudo-spin-1/2\nparamagnet with a moment of about 2.2 muB. The magnetic specific heat (Cm)\nexhibits no field dependence and demonstrates the absence of long range\nmagnetic order down to 0.35 K. Cm/T passes through a broad maximum at about 10\nK and Cm=T^2 at low temperatures. Measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation\nrate (1/T1) reveal a gapless slowing down of spin fluctuations upon cooling\nwith 1/T1=T^2.2. The results from NMR and muSR are consistent with a scenario\nin which a minority of Rh4+ moments are in a ahort-range correlated frozen\nstate and coexist with a majority of moments in a liquid-like state that\ncontinue to fluctuate at low temperatures.\n", "  A useful approach is investigated in order to analyze a class of a stochastic\ndifferential equations that can be encountered in quantum optics problems,\nespecially, in the case of two photon losses on the driven cavity mode. The\npassage to the ordinary coupled differential equations is presented and the\ntreatment of the obtained coupled system is explored. Generalization of the\nproblem to stimulate variable coefficients is discussed and the exact solutions\nare achieved in explicit forms under suitable conditions on the coefficients.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the nature of the fractional quantum Hall state\nin the 1/3-filled second Landau level (SLL) at filling factor $\\nu=7/3$ (and\n8/3 in the presence of the particle-hole symmetry) via exact diagonalization in\nboth torus and spherical geometries. Specifically, we compute the overlap\nbetween the exact 7/3 ground state and various competing states including (i)\nthe Laughlin state, (ii) the fermionic Haffnian state, (iii) the\nantisymmetrized product state of two composite fermion seas at 1/6 filling, and\n(iv) the particle-hole (PH) conjugate of the $Z_4$ parafermion state. All these\ntrial states are constructed according to a guiding principle called the\nbilayer mapping approach, where a trial state is obtained as the\nantisymmetrized projection of a bilayer quantum Hall state with interlayer\ndistance $d$ as a variational parameter. Under the proper understanding of the\nground-state degeneracy in the torus geometry, the $Z_4$ parafermion state can\nbe obtained as the antisymmetrized projection of the Halperin (330) state.\nSimilarly, it is proved in this work that the fermionic Haffnian state can be\nobtained as the antisymmetrized projection of the Halperin (551) state. It is\nshown that, while extremely accurate at sufficiently large positive Haldane\npseudopotential variation $\\delta V_1^{(1)}$, the Laughlin state loses its\noverlap with the exact 7/3 ground state significantly at $\\delta V_1^{(1)}\n\\simeq 0$. At slightly negative $\\delta V_1^{(1)}$, it is shown that the\nPH-conjugated $Z_4$ parafermion state has a substantial overlap with the exact\n7/3 ground state, which is the highest among the above four trial states.\n", "  We calculate the electric conductivity of a gas of relativistic particles\nwith isotropic cross sections using the Boltzmann equation as the starting\npoint. Our analyses is restricted to elastic collisions. We show the perfect\nagreement with previously published numerical results for a massless quark-\ngluon plasma, and give results for the electric conductivity of an interacting\nhadron gas, employing realistic resonance cross sections. These results for the\nelectric conductivity of a hot hadron gas, as created in (ultra-)relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions, are of rich phenomenological as well as theoretical\ninterest and can be compared to, e.g., lattice quantum field theory\ncalculations.\n", "  We investigate the iterated Kronecker product of a square matrix with itself\nand prove an invariance property for symmetric subspaces. This motivates the\ndefinition of an iterated symmetric Kronecker product and the derivation of an\nexplicit formula for its action on vectors. We apply our result for describing\na linear change in the matrix parametrization of semiclassical wave packets.\n", "  We performed Raman studies and a dielectric characterization of the\npseudo-kagome Cu3Bi(SeO3)2O2X (X = Cl, Br). These compounds share competing\nnearest-neighbour ferromagnetic exchange and frustrating next-nearest-neighbour\nantiferromagnetic exchange as well as highly noncollinear magnetic ground\nstate. However, at low temperature they differ with respect to the existence of\ninversion symmetry. For both compounds there exists a pronounced interplay of\npolar phonon modes with quantum magnetic fluctuations. A novel Raman mode\nappears for temperatures below the Neel temperature with a Fano lineshape and\nan enormous intensity that exceeds most of the phonon lines. We discuss a\npossible contribution of longitudinal magnons to this signal. In contrast, one\nmagnon scattering based on linear transvers magnons is excluded based on a\nsymmetry analysis of spin wave representations and Raman tensor calculations.\nThere exists evidence that in these pseudo-kagome compounds magnetic quantum\nfluctuations carry an electric dipole moment. Our data as well as a comparison\nwith previous far-infrared spectra allow us to conclude that Cu3Bi(SeO3)2O2Cl\nchanges its symmetry most likely from Pmmn to P21mn with a second order\nstructural phase transition at T*=120 K and becomes multiferroic.\nCu3Bi(SeO3)2O2Br represents an interesting counter part as it does not show\nthis instability and stays inversion symmetric down to lowest temperatures,\ninvestigated.\n", "  In a recent Rapid Communication [A. Stan, Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{93}, 041103(R)\n(2016)], the reliability of the Keldysh--Kadanoff--Baym equations (KBE) using\ncorrelated selfenergy approximations applied to linear and nonlinear response\nhas been questioned. In particular, the existence of a universal attractor has\nbeen predicted that would drive the dynamics of any correlated system towards\nan unphysical homogeneous density distribution regardless of the system type,\nthe interaction and the many-body approximation. Moreover, it was conjectured\nthat even the mean-field dynamics would be damped. Here, by performing accurate\nsolutions of the KBE for situations studied in that paper, we prove these\nclaims wrong being caused by numerical inaccuracies.\n", "  By combining $n$-type $\\mathrm{Bi_2Te_3}$ and $p$-type $\\mathrm{Sb_2Te_3}$\ntopological insulators, vertically stacked $p$-$n$ junctions can be formed,\nallowing to position the Fermi level into the bulk band gap and also tune\nbetween $n$- and $p$-type surface carriers. Here we use low-temperature\nmagnetotransport measurements to probe the surface and bulk transport modes in\na range of vertical $\\mathrm{Bi_2Te_3/Sb_2Te_3}$ heterostructures with varying\nrelative thicknesses of the top and bottom layers. With increasing thickness of\nthe $\\mathrm{Sb_2Te_3}$ layer we observe a change from $n$- to $p$-type\nbehavior via a specific thickness where the Hall signal is immeasurable.\nAssuming that the the bulk and surface states contribute in parallel, we can\ncalculate and reproduce the dependence of the Hall and longitudinal components\nof resistivity on the film thickness. This highlights the role played by the\nbulk conduction channels which, importantly, cannot be probed using surface\nsensitive spectroscopic techniques. Our calculations are then buttressed by a\nsemi-classical Boltzmann transport theory which rigorously shows the vanishing\nof the Hall signal. Our results provide crucial experimental and theoretical\ninsights into the relative roles of the surface and bulk in the vertical\ntopological $p$-$n$ junctions.\n", "  The quantum internet holds promise for performing quantum communication, such\nas quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution, freely between any\nparties all over the globe. For such a quantum internet protocol, a general\nfundamental upper bound on the performance has been derived [K. Azuma, A.\nMizutani, and H.-K. Lo, arXiv:1601.02933]. Here we consider its converse\nproblem. In particular, we present a protocol constructible from any given\nquantum network, which is based on running quantum repeater schemes in parallel\nover the network. The performance of this protocol and the upper bound restrict\nthe quantum capacity and the private capacity over the network from both sides.\nThe optimality of the protocol is related to fundamental problems such as\nadditivity questions for quantum channels and questions on the existence of a\ngap between quantum and private capacities.\n", "  Using the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model we simultaneously fit the HI mass\nfunction, stellar mass function and galaxy colours. We find good fits to all\nthree observations at z = 0 and to the stellar mass function and galaxy colours\nat z = 2. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques we adjust the\nL-Galaxies parameters to best fit the constraining data. In order to fit the HI\nmass function we must greatly reduce the gas surface density threshold for star\nformation, thus lowering the number of low HI mass galaxies. A simultaneous\nreduction in the star formation efficiency prevents the over production of\nstellar content. A simplified model in which the surface density threshold is\neliminated altogether also provides a good fit to the data. Unfortunately,\nthese changes weaken the fit to the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and raise the\nstar-formation rate density at recent times, suggesting that a change to the\nmodel is required to prevent accumulation of gas onto dwarf galaxies in the\nlocal universe.\n", "  A concept of bypass rewiring is introduced and random bypass rewiring is\nanalytically and numerically investigated with simulations. Our results show\nthat bypass rewiring makes networks robust against removal of nodes including\nrandom failures and attacks. In particular, random bypass rewiring connects all\nnodes except the removed nodes on an even degree infinite network and makes the\npercolation threshold 0 for arbitrary occupation probabilities. In our example,\nthe even degree network is more robust than the original network with random\nbypass rewiring while the original network is more robust than the even degree\nnetworks without random bypass. We propose a greedy bypass rewiring algorithm\nwhich guarantees the maximum size of the largest component at each step,\nassuming which node will be removed next is unknown. The simulation result\nshows that the greedy bypass rewiring algorithm improves the robustness of the\nautonomous system of the Internet under attacks more than random bypass\nrewiring.\n", "  We consider Landau Hamiltonians with a weak coupling random electric\npotential of breather type.\n  Under appropriate assumptions we prove a Wegner estimate.\n  It implies the Hoelder continuity of the integrated density of states.\n  The main challenge is the problem how to deal with non-linear dependence on\nthe random parameters.\n", "  With the advent of ultra-high power lasers the nonlinear nature of the vacuum\nof quantum electrodynamics (QED) can be probed. Due to the highly nonlinear\nstructure of the underlying equations new numerical algorithms are required. A\nnumerical scheme for simulating the nonlinear optical effects of the QED vacuum\nin up to 3 spatial dimensions plus time is derived. Its properties are\ndiscussed. The validity of the numerical approach is verified with the help of\nknown analytic results. The algorithm is used to explore nonlinear all optical\neffects of the nonlinear vacuum for which analytic methods are inefficient or\nimpossible.\n", "  Some physical objects are hardly accessible to direct experimentation. It is\nthen desirable to infer their properties based solely on the interactions they\nhave with systems over which we have control. In this spirit, here we introduce\nschemes for assessing the non-classicality of the inaccessible objects as\ncharacterised by quantum discord. We consider two probes individually\ninteracting with the inaccessible object, but not with each other. The schemes\nare based on monitoring entanglement dynamics between the probes. Our method is\nrobust and experimentally friendly as it allows the probes and the object to be\nopen systems, makes no assumptions about the initial state, dimensionality of\ninvolved Hilbert spaces and details of the probe-object Hamiltonian. We apply\nour scheme to a membrane-in-the-middle optomechanical system, to detect\nsystem-environment correlations in open system dynamics as well as\nnon-classicality of the environment, and we foresee potential benefits for the\ninference of the non-classical nature of gravity.\n", "  In the presence of approximate global symmetries that forbid relevant\ninteractions, strongly coupled light Dark Matter (DM) can appear weakly coupled\nat small energy and generate a sizable relic abundance. Fundamental principles\nlike unitarity restrict these symmetries to a small class, where the leading\ninteractions are captured by effective operators up to dimension-8. Chiral\nsymmetry, spontaneously broken global symmetries and non-linearly realized\nsupersymmetry are examples of this. Their DM candidates (composite fermions,\npseudo Nambu-Goldstone Bosons and Goldstini) are interesting targets for LHC\nmissing-energy searches.\n", "  PSR J1023+0038 (J1023) is a binary system hosting a neutron star and a low\nmass companion. J1023 is the best studied transitional pulsar, alternating a\nfaint eclipsing millisecond radio pulsar state to a brighter X-ray active\nstate. At variance with other Low Mass X-ray binaries, this active state\nreaches luminosities of only ~$10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, showing strong, fast\nvariability. In the active state, J1023 displays: i) a high state\n($L_X\\sim7\\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$, 0.3-80 keV) occurring ~80% of the time\nand during which X-ray pulsations at the neutron star spin period are detected\n(pulsed fraction ~8%); ii) a low state ($L_X~10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$) during\nwhich pulsations are not detected (~<3%); and iii) a flaring state during which\nsporadic flares occur in excess of ~$10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with no pulsation\ntoo. The transition between the high and the low states is very rapid, on a ~10\ns timescale. Here we put forward a plausible physical interpretation of the\nhigh and low states based on the (fast) transition among the propeller state\nand the radio pulsar state. We modelled the XMM-Newton spectra of the high, low\nand radio pulsar states, finding a good agreement with this physical picture.\n", "  We develop a formalism relating nonlocal current continuity to spatial\nsymmetries of subparts in discrete Schr\\\"odinger systems. Breaking of such\nlocal symmetries hereby generates sources or sinks for the associated nonlocal\ncurrents. The framework is applied to locally inversion-(time-) and\ntranslation-(time-) symmetric one-dimensional photonic waveguide arrays with\nHermitian or non-Hermitian effective tight-binding Hamiltonians. For stationary\nstates the nonlocal currents become translationally invariant within symmetric\ndomains, exposing different types of local symmetry. They are further employed\nto derive a mapping between wave amplitudes of symmetry-related sites,\ngeneralizing also the global Bloch and parity mapping to local symmetry in\ndiscrete systems. In scattering setups, perfectly transmitting states are\ncharacterized by aligned invariant currents in attached symmetry domains, whose\nvanishing signifies a correspondingly symmetric density. For periodically\ndriven arrays, the invariance of the nonlocal currents is retained on period\naverage for quasi-energy eigenstates. The proposed theory of symmetry-induced\ncontinuity and local invariants may contribute to the understanding of wave\nstructure and response in systems with localized spatial order.\n", "  Quantum spin Hall (QSH) materials promise revolutionary device applications\nbased on dissipationless propagation of spin currents. They are two-dimensional\n(2D) representatives of the family of topological insulators, which exhibit\nconduction channels at their edges inherently protected against scattering.\nInitially predicted for graphene, and eventually realized in HgTe quantum\nwells, in the QSH systems realized so far, the decisive bottleneck preventing\napplications is the small bulk energy gap of less than 30 meV, requiring\ncryogenic operation temperatures in order to suppress detrimental bulk\ncontributions to the edge conductance. Room-temperature functionalities,\nhowever, require much larger gaps. Here we show how this can be achieved by\nmaking use of a new QSH paradigm based on substrate-supported atomic monolayers\nof a high-Z element. Experimentally, the material is synthesized as honeycomb\nlattice of bismuth atoms, forming \"bismuthene\", on top of the wide-gap\nsubstrate SiC(0001). Consistent with the theoretical expectations, the\nspectroscopic signatures in experiment display a huge gap of ~0.8 eV in\nbismuthene, as well as conductive edge states. The analysis of the\nlayer-substrate orbitals arrives at a QSH phase, whose topological gap - as a\nhallmark mechanism - is driven directly by the atomic spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC). Our results demonstrate how strained artificial lattices of heavy atoms,\nin contact with an insulating substrate, can be utilized to evoke a novel\ntopological wide-gap scenario, where the chemical potential is located well\nwithin the global system gap, ensuring pure edge state conductance. We\nanticipate future experiments on topological signatures, such as transport\nmeasurements that probe the QSH effect via quantized universal conductance,\nnotably at room temperature.\n", "  The response of a cold atom gas with contact interactions to a smoothly\nvarying external harmonic confinement in the non-adiabatic regime is studied.\nThe time variation of the angular frequency is varied such that the system is,\nfor vanishing or infinitely strong contact interactions, scale invariant. The\ntime evolution of the system with broken scale invariance (i.e., the time\nevolution of the system with finite interaction strength), is contrasted with\nthat for a scale invariant system, which exhibits Efimovian-like expansion\ndynamics that is characterized by log-periodic oscillations with unique period\nand amplitude. It is found that the breaking of the scale invariance by the\nfiniteness of the interactions leads to a time dependence of the oscillation\nperiod and amplitude. It is argued, based on analytical considerations for\natomic gases of arbitrary size and numerical results for two one-dimensional\nparticles, that the oscillation pe riod approaches that of the scale-invariant\nsystem at large times. The role of the time-dependent contact in the expansion\ndynamics is analyzed.\n", "  It has long been established that turbulent jets comprise large-scale\ncoherent structures, now more commonly referred to as \"wavepackets\". These\nstructures exhibit a remarkable spatio-temporal organisation, despite\nturbulence.\n  In this work we analyse, from a qualitative point of view, the temporal\ndynamics of axisymmetric wavepackets educed, experimentally, from subsonic\niso-thermal jets. We use the data presented by, where time-series of the\nwavepackets are extracted at different streamwise locations. A thorough\nanalysis is performed, statistical tools are used for estimating the embedding\nand correlation dimensions characterising the dynamical system. System\nidentification is used for computing nonlinear surrogate models. Finally,\ncontrol-oriented linear models are computed.\n  The goal of the contribution is to assess the extent to which non-linear\nmodels are necessary, or appropriate, for description of the temporal\nwave-packet dynamics and to provide a complementary perspective to the current\nmodelling.\n", "  We study the properties and direct detection prospects of an as of yet\nneglected population of dark matter (DM) particles moving in orbits\ngravitationally bound to the Earth. This DM population is expected to form via\nscattering by nuclei in the Earth's interior. We compute fluxes and nuclear\nrecoil energy spectra expected at direct detection experiments for the new DM\npopulation considering detectors with and without directional sensitivity, and\ndifferent types of target materials and DM-nucleon interactions. DM particles\nbound to the Earth manifest as a prominent rise in the low-energy part of the\nobserved nuclear recoil energy spectrum. Ultra-low threshold energies of about\n1 eV are needed to resolve this effect. Its shape is independent of the\nDM-nucleus scattering cross-section normalisation.\n", "  We use the subleading soft-graviton theorem to construct an operator $T_{zz}$\nwhose insertion in the four-dimensional tree-level quantum gravity\n$\\mathcal{S}$-matrix obeys the Virasoro-Ward identities of the energy momentum\ntensor of a two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT$_2$). The celestial\nsphere at Minkowskian null infinity plays the role of the Euclidean sphere of\nthe CFT$_2$, with the Lorentz group acting as the unbroken $SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$\nsubgroup.\n", "  We study survival time statistics in a noisy sample space reducing (SSR)\nprocess. Our simulations suggest that both the mean and standard deviation\nscale as $\\sim N/N^{\\lambda}$, where $N$ is the system size and $\\lambda$ is a\ntunable parameter that characterizes the process. The survival time\ndistribution has the form $\\mathcal{P}_{N}(\\tau)\\sim\nN^{-\\theta}J(\\tau/N^{\\theta})$, where $J$ is a universal scaling function and\n$\\theta = 1-\\lambda$. Analytical insight is provided by a conjecture for the\nequivalence between the survival time statistics in the noisy SSR process and\nthe record statistics in a correlated time series modeled as drifted random\nwalk with Cauchy distributed jumps.\n", "  The Clausius inequality (CI) form of the second law of thermodynamics relates\ninformation changes (entropy) to changes in the first moment of the energy\n(heat and indirectly also work). Are there similar relations between other\nmoments of the energy distribution, and other information measures, or is the\nClausius inequality a one of a kind instance of the energy-information\nparadigm? If there are additional relations, can they be used to make\npredictions on measurable quantities? Changes in the energy distribution beyond\nthe first moment (average heat or work) are especially important in small\nsystems which are often very far from thermal equilibrium. The generalized\nClausius inequalities (GCI's), here derived, provide positive answers to the\ntwo questions above and add another layer to the fundamental connection between\nenergy and information. To illustrate the utility of the new GCI's, we find\nscenarios where the GCI's yield tighter constraints on performance (e.g. in\nthermal machines) compared to the second law. To obtain the GCI's we use the\nBregman divergence - a mathematical tool found to be highly suitable for\nenergy-information studies. The quantum version of the GCI's provides a\nthermodynamic meaning to various quantum coherence measures. It is intriguing\nto fully map the regime of validity of the GCI's and extend the present results\nto more general scenarios including continuous systems and particles exchange\nwith the baths.\n", "  ATLAS measurements of two-particle correlations are presented for $\\sqrt{s} =\n5.02$ and $13$ TeV $pp$ collisions and for $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV\n$p$+Pb collisions at the LHC. The correlation functions are measured as a\nfunction of relative azimuthal angle $\\Delta \\phi$, and pseudorapidity\nseparation $\\Delta \\eta$, using charged particles detected within the\npseudorapidity interval $|\\eta|{<}2.5$. Azimuthal modulation in the long-range\ncomponent of the correlation function, with $|\\Delta\\eta|{>}2$, is studied\nusing a template fitting procedure to remove a \"back-to-back\" contribution to\nthe correlation function that primarily arises from hard-scattering processes.\nIn addition to the elliptic, $\\cos{(2\\Delta\\phi)}$, modulation observed in a\nprevious measurement, the $pp$ correlation functions exhibit significant\n$\\cos{(3\\Delta\\phi)}$ and $\\cos{(4\\Delta\\phi)}$ modulation. The Fourier\ncoefficients $v_{n,n}$ associated with the $\\cos{(n\\Delta\\phi)}$ modulation of\nthe correlation functions for $n =$ $2$-$4$ are measured as a function of\ncharged-particle multiplicity and charged-particle transverse momentum. The\nFourier coefficients are observed to be compatible with $\\cos{(n\\phi)}$\nmodulation of per-event single-particle azimuthal angle distributions. The\nsingle-particle Fourier coefficients $v_n$ are measured as a function of\ncharged-particle multiplicity, and charged-particle transverse momentum for $n\n{=} $ $2$-$4$. The integrated luminosities used in this analysis are, $64$\n$\\mathrm{nb^{-1}}$ for the $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV $pp$ data, $170$\n$\\mathrm{nb^{-1}}$ for the $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV $pp$ data and $28$\n$\\mathrm{nb^{-1}}$ for the $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV $p$+Pb data.\n", "  One major background in direct searches for weakly interacting massive\nparticles (WIMPs) comes from the deposition of radon progeny on detector\nsurfaces. The most dangerous surface background is the $^{206}$Pb recoils\nproduced by $^{210}$Po decays. In this letter, we report the first\ncharacterization of this background in liquid argon. The scintillation signal\nof low energy Pb recoils is measured to be highly quenched in argon, and we\nestimate that the 103keV $^{206}$Pb recoil background will produce a signal\nequal to that of a ~5keV (30keV) electron recoil ($^{40}$Ar recoil). In\naddition, we demonstrate that this dangerous $^{210}$Po surface background can\nbe suppressed by a factor of ~100 or higher using pulse shape discrimination\nmethods, which can make argon dark matter detectors near background-free and\nenhance their potential for discovery of medium- and high-mass WIMPs. We also\ndiscuss the impact on other low background experiments.\n", "  We present a measurement of galaxy-galaxy lensing around a magnitude-limited\n($i_{AB} < 22.5$) sample of galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey Science\nVerification (DES-SV) data. We split these lenses into three\nphotometric-redshift bins from 0.2 to 0.8, and determine the product of the\ngalaxy bias $b$ and cross-correlation coefficient between the galaxy and dark\nmatter overdensity fields $r$ in each bin, using scales above 4 Mpc/$h$\ncomoving, where we find the linear bias model to be valid given our current\nuncertainties. We compare our galaxy bias results from galaxy-galaxy lensing\nwith those obtained from galaxy clustering (Crocce et al. 2016) and CMB lensing\n(Giannantonio et al. 2016) for the same sample of galaxies, and find our\nmeasurements to be in good agreement with those in Crocce et al. (2016), while,\nin the lowest redshift bin ($z\\sim0.3$), they show some tension with the\nfindings in Giannantonio et al. (2016). We measure $b\\cdot r$ to be $0.87\\pm\n0.11$, $1.12 \\pm 0.16$ and $1.24\\pm 0.23$, respectively for the three redshift\nbins of width $\\Delta z = 0.2$ in the range $0.2<z <0.8$, defined with the\nphotometric-redshift algorithm BPZ. Using a different code to split the lens\nsample, TPZ, leads to changes in the measured biases at the 10-20\\% level, but\nit does not alter the main conclusion of this work: when comparing with Crocce\net al. (2016) we do not find strong evidence for a cross-correlation parameter\nsignificantly below one in this galaxy sample, except possibly at the lowest\nredshift bin ($z\\sim 0.3$), where we find $r = 0.71 \\pm 0.11$ when using TPZ,\nand $0.83 \\pm 0.12$ with BPZ.\n", "  The holographic model of V-QCD is used to analyze the physics of QCD in the\nVeneziano large-N limit. An unprecedented analysis of the CP-odd physics is\nperformed going beyond the level of effective field theories. The structure of\nholographic saddle-points at finite $\\theta$ is determined, as well as its\ninterplay with chiral symmetry breaking. Many observables (vacuum energy and\nhigher-order susceptibilities, singlet and non-singlet masses and mixings) are\ncomputed as functions of $\\theta$ and the quark mass $m$. Wherever applicable\nthe results are compared to those of chiral Lagrangians, finding agreement. In\nparticular, we recover the Witten-Veneziano formula in the small $x\\to 0$\nlimit, we compute the $\\theta$-dependence of the pion mass and we derive the\nhyperscaling relation for the topological susceptibility in the conformal\nwindow in terms of the quark mass.\n", "  This thesis is an elaboration of recent results on the holographic\nre-construction of metric-like interactions in higher-spin gauge theories on\nanti-de Sitter space (AdS), employing their conjectured holographic duality\nwith free conformal field theories (CFTs). After reviewing the general approach\nand establishing the necessary intermediate results, we extract explicit\nexpressions for the complete cubic action on AdS$_{d+1}$ and the quartic\nself-interaction of the scalar on AdS$_4$ for the type A minimal bosonic\nhigher-spin theory from the three- and four- point correlation functions of\nsingle-trace operators in the free scalar $O\\left(N\\right)$ vector model. For\nthis purpose tools were developed to evaluate tree-level three-point Witten\ndiagrams involving fields of arbitrary integer spin and the conformal partial\nwave expansions of tree-level four-point Witten diagrams, which are underpinned\nby the ambient space formulation of AdS space and CFT. We also discuss the\nimplications of the holographic duality on the locality properties of\ninteractions in higher-spin gauge theories.\n", "  Bianchi attractors are near horizon geometries with homogeneous symmetries in\nthe spatial directions. We construct supersymmetric Bianchi attractors in\n$\\mathcal{N}=2, d=4,5$ gauged supergravity. In $d=4$ we consider gauged\nsupergravity coupled to vector and hypermultiplets. In $d=5$ we consider gauged\nsupergravity coupled to vector multiplets with a generic gauging of symmetries\nof the scalar manifold and the $U(1)_R$ gauging of the $R$-symmetry. Analyzing\nthe gaugino conditions we show that when the fermionic shifts do not vanish\nthere are no supersymmetric Bianchi attractors. This is analogous to the known\ncondition that for maximally supersymmetric solutions, all the fermionic shifts\nmust vanish. When the central charge satisfies an extremization condition, some\nof the fermionic shifts vanish and supersymmetry requires that the symmetries\nof the scalar manifold do not be gauged. This allows supersymmetric Bianchi\nattractors sourced by massless gauge fields and a cosmological constant. In\nfive dimensions in the Bianchi I class we show that the anisotropic\n$AdS_3\\times\\mathbb{R}^2$ solution is $1/2$ BPS. We also construct a new class\nof $1/2$ BPS Bianchi III geometries labeled by the central charge. When the\ncentral charge takes a special value the Bianchi III geometry reduces to the\nknown $AdS_3\\times\\mathbb{H}^2$ solution. For the Bianchi V and VII classes the\nradial spinor breaks all of supersymmetry. We briefly discuss the conditions\nfor possible massive supersymmetric Bianchi solutions by generalizing the\nmatter content to include tensor, hypermultiplets and a generic gauging on the\nR symmetry.\n", "  Higher moments of multiplicity fluctuations of hadrons produced in central\nnucleus-nucleus collisions are studied within the hadron-resonance gas model in\nthe canonical ensemble. Exact conservation of three charges, baryon number,\nelectric charge, and strangeness, is enforced in the large volume limit.\nMoments up to the forth order of various particles are calculated at SPS, RHIC\nand LHC energies. The asymptotic fluctuations within a simplified model with\nonly one conserved charge in the canonical ensemble are discussed where simple\nanalytical expressions for moments of multiplicity distributions can be\nobtained. Moments products of net-proton, net-kaon, and net-charge\ndistributions in Au + Au collisions at RHIC energies are calculated. The\npseudo-rapidity coverage dependence of net-charge fluctuation is discussed.\n", "  In this paper we quantize superconformal $\\sigma$-models defined by worldline\nsupermultiplets. Two types of superconformal mechanics, with and without a DFF\nterm, are considered. Without a DFF term (Calogero potential only) the\nsupersymmetry is unbroken. The models with a DFF term correspond to deformed\n(if the Calogero potential is present) or undeformed oscillators. For these\n(un)deformed oscillators the classical invariant superconformal algebra acts as\na spectrum-generating algebra of the quantum theory. Besides the $osp(1|2)$\nexamples, we explicitly quantize the superconformally-invariant worldine\n$\\sigma$-models defined by the ${\\cal N}=4$ $(1,4,3)$ supermultiplet (with\n$D(2,1;\\alpha)$ invariance, for $\\alpha\\neq 0,-1$) and by the ${\\cal N}=2$\n$(2,2,0)$ supermultiplet (with two-dimensional target and $sl(2|1)$\ninvariance). The parameter $\\alpha$ is the scaling dimension of the $(1,4,3)$\nsupermultiplet and, in the DFF case, has a direct interpretation as a vacuum\nenergy. In the DFF case, for the $sl(2|1)$ models, the scaling dimension\n$\\lambda$ is quantized (either $\\lambda=\\frac{1}{2}+{\\mathbb Z}$ or\n$\\lambda={\\mathbb Z}$). The ordinary two-dimensional oscillator is recovered,\nafter imposing a superselection restriction, from the $\\lambda=-\\frac{1}{2}$\nmodel. In particular a single bosonic vacuum is selected. The spectrum of the\nunrestricted two-dimensional theory is decomposed into an infinite set of\nlowest weight representations of $sl(2|1)$. Extra fermionic raising operators,\nnot belonging to the original $sl(2|1)$ superalgebra, allow (for\n$\\lambda=\\frac{1}{2}+{\\mathbb Z}$) to construct the whole spectrum from the two\ndegenerate (one bosonic and one fermionic) vacua.\n", "  We uncover anisotropic permeability in microfluidic deterministic lateral\ndisplacement (DLD) arrays. A DLD array can achieve high-resolution bimodal\nsize-based separation of microparticles, including bioparticles, such as cells.\nFor an application with a given separation size, correct device operation\nrequires that the flow remains at a fixed angle to the obstacle array. We\ndemonstrate via experiments and lattice-Boltzmann simulations that subtle array\ndesign features cause anisotropic permeability. Anisotropic permeability\nindicates the microfluidic array's intrinsic tendency to induce an undesired\nlateral pressure gradient. This can cause an inclined flow and therefore local\nchanges in the critical separation size. Thus, particle trajectories can become\nunpredictable and the device useless for the desired separation task.\nAnisotropy becomes severe for arrays with unequal axial and lateral gaps\nbetween obstacle posts and highly asymmetric post shapes. Furthermore, of the\ntwo equivalent array layouts employed with the DLD, the rotated-square layout\ndoes not display intrinsic anisotropy. We therefore recommend this layout over\nthe easier-to-implement parallelogram layout. We provide additional guidelines\nfor avoiding adverse effects of anisotropy on the DLD.\n", "  In electronic topological Dirac semimetals the conduction and valence bands\ntouch at discrete points in the Brillouin zone and form Dirac cones. They are\nrobust against spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and protected by crystal\nsymmetries. They can be driven to different topological phases by breaking the\nsymmetries. In the low-temperature quantum magnetic systems the magnon\ndispersions have similar band structures as the electron dispersions, but with\npositive definite energies. In these magnetic systems SOI manifests in the form\nof the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In this Communication, we\nidentify two types of {\\it magnonic Dirac semimetals} in quasi-two-dimensional\nquantum magnets. The first type is a consequence of topological phase\ntransition between trivial and topological magnon insulators and the second\ntype is intrinsic and protected by crystal symmetries. They are robust against\nDMI and can be driven to a topological magnon phase by breaking the symmetries.\nThey can be manipulated by an external magnetic field and accessible by the\nbulk sensitive inelastic neutron scattering experiments.\n", "  We extend recent theoretical results on the propagation of linear\ngravitational waves (GWs), including their associated memories, in spatially\nflat Friedmann--Lema\\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) universes, for all\nspacetime dimensions higher than 3. By specializing to a cosmology driven by a\nperfect fluid with a constant equation-of-state $w$ -- conformal re-scaling,\ndimension-reduction and Nariai's ansatz may then be exploited to obtain\nanalytic expressions for the graviton and photon Green's functions, allowing\ntheir causal structure to be elucidated. When $0 < w \\leq 1$, the\ngauge-invariant scalar mode admits wave solutions, and like its tensor\ncounterpart, likely contributes to the tidal squeezing and stretching of the\nspace around a GW detector. In addition, scalar GWs in 4D radiation dominated\nuniverses -- like tensor GWs in 4D matter dominated ones -- appear to yield a\ntail signal that does not decay with increasing spatial distance from the\nsource. We then solve electromagnetism in the same cosmologies, and point out a\ntail-induced electric memory effect. Finally, in even dimensional Minkowski\nbackgrounds higher than 2, we make a brief but explicit comparison between the\nlinear GW memory generated by point masses scattering off each other on unbound\ntrajectories and the linear Yang-Mills memory generated by color point charges\ndoing the same -- and point out how there is a \"double copy\" relation between\nthe two.\n", "  The article deals with the analysis of color distribution in noctilucent\nclouds (NLC) in the sky based on multi-wavelength (RGB) CCD-photometry provided\nwith the all-sky camera in Lovozero in the north of Russia (68.0 deg N, 35.1\ndeg E) during the bright expanded NLC performance in the night of August 12,\n2016. Small changes in the NLC color across the sky are interpreted as the\natmospheric absorption and extinction effects combined with the difference in\nthe Mie scattering functions of NLC particles for the three color channels of\nthe camera. The method described in this paper is used to find the effective\nmonodisperse radius of particles about 55 nm. The result of these simple and\ncost-effective measurements is in good agreement with previous estimations of\ncomparable accuracy. Non-spherical particles, Gaussian and lognormal\ndistribution of the particle size are also considered.\n", "  We present a device demonstrating a lithographically patterned transmon\nintegrated with a micromachined cavity resonator. Our two-cavity, one-qubit\ndevice is a multilayer microwave integrated quantum circuit (MMIQC), comprising\na basic unit capable of performing circuit-QED (cQED) operations. We describe\nthe qubit-cavity coupling mechanism of a specialized geometry using an electric\nfield picture and a circuit model, and finally obtain specific system\nparameters using simulations. Fabrication of the MMIQC includes lithography,\netching, and metallic bonding of silicon wafers. Superconducting wafer bonding\nis a critical capability that is demonstrated by a micromachined storage cavity\nlifetime $34.3~\\mathrm{\\mu s}$, corresponding to a quality factor of 2 million\nat single-photon energies. The transmon coherence times are\n$T_1=6.4~\\mathrm{\\mu s}$, and $T_2^{Echo}= 11.7~\\mathrm{\\mu s}$. We measure\nqubit-cavity dispersive coupling with rate $\\chi_{q\\mu}/2\\pi=-1.17~$MHz,\nconstituting a Jaynes-Cummings system with an interaction strength\n$g/2\\pi=49~$MHz. With these parameters we are able to demonstrate cQED\noperations in the strong dispersive regime with ease. Finally, we highlight\nseveral improvements and anticipated extensions of the technology to complex\nMMIQCs.\n", "  We explore observational and theoretical constraints on how galaxies might\ntransition between the \"star-forming main sequence\" (SFMS) and varying \"degrees\nof quiescence\" out to $z=3$. Our analysis is focused on galaxies with stellar\nmass $M_*>10^{10}M_{\\odot}$, and is enabled by GAMA and CANDELS observations, a\nsemi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation, and a cosmological\nhydrodynamical \"zoom in\" simulation with momentum-driven AGN feedback. In both\nthe observations and the SAM, transition galaxies tend to have intermediate\nS\\'ersic indices, half-light radii, and surface stellar mass densities compared\nto star-forming and quiescent galaxies out to $z=3$. We place an observational\nupper limit on the average population transition timescale as a function of\nredshift, finding that the average high-redshift galaxy is on a \"fast track\"\nfor quenching whereas the average low-redshift galaxy is on a \"slow track\" for\nquenching. We qualitatively identify four physical origin scenarios for\ntransition galaxies in the SAM: oscillations on the SFMS, slow quenching, fast\nquenching, and rejuvenation. Quenching timescales in both the SAM and the\nhydrodynamical simulation are not fast enough to reproduce the quiescent\npopulation that we observe at $z\\sim3$. In the SAM, we do not find a clear-cut\nmorphological dependence of quenching timescales, but we do predict that the\nmean stellar ages, cold gas fractions, SMBH masses, and halo masses of\ntransition galaxies tend to be intermediate relative to those of star-forming\nand quiescent galaxies at $z<3$.\n", "  It is argued that a weak value of an observable is a robust property of a\nsingle pre- and post-selected quantum system rather than a statistical\nproperty. During an infinitesimal time a system with a given weak value affects\nother systems as if it were in an eigenstate with eigenvalue equal to the weak\nvalue. This differs significantly from the action of a system pre-selected only\nand possessing a numerically equal expectation value. The weak value has a\nphysical meaning beyond a conditional average of a pointer in the weak\nmeasurement procedure. The difference between the weak value and the\nexpectation value has been demonstrated on the example of photon polarization.\nIn addition, the weak values for systems pre- and post-selected in mixed states\nare considered.\n", "  Linear acceleration in free space is a topic that has been studied for over\n20 years, and its ability to eventually produce high-quality, high energy\nmulti-particle bunches has remained a subject of great interest. Arguments can\ncertainly be made that such an ability is very doubtful. Nevertheless, we chose\nto develop an accurate and truly predictive theoretical formalism to explore\nthis remote possibility in a computational experiment. The formalism includes\nexact treatment of Maxwell's equations, exact relativistic treatment of the\ninteraction among the multiple individual particles, and exact treatment of the\ninteraction at near and far field. Several surprising results emerged. For\nexample, we find that 30 keV electrons (2.5% energy spread) can be accelerated\nto 7.7 MeV (2.5% spread) and to 205 MeV (0.25% spread) using 25 mJ and 2.5 J\nlasers respectively. These findings should hopefully guide and help develop\ncompact, high-quality, ultra-relativistic electron sources, avoiding\nconventional limits imposed by material breakdown or structural constraints.\n", "  In this work we investigate the observability of Inert Doublet Model scalars\nat the LHC operating at the center of mass energy of 14 TeV. The signal\nproduction process is $pp \\to AH^\\pm \\to ZHW^{\\pm}H$ leading to two different\nfinal states of $\\ell^+\\ell^-Hjj H$ and $\\ell^+\\ell^-H\\ell^\\pm\\nu H$ based on\nthe hadronic and leptonic decay channels of the W boson. All the relevant\nbackground processes are considered and an event selection is designed to\ndistinguish the signal from the large Standard Model background. We found that\nsignals of the selected search channels are well observable at the LHC with\nintegrated luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$.\n", "  Using a suite of three large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations,\nHorizon-AGN, Horizon-noAGN (no AGN feedback) and Horizon-DM (no baryons), we\ninvestigate how a typical sub-grid model for AGN feedback affects the evolution\nof the inner density profiles of massive dark matter haloes and galaxies. Based\non direct object-to-object comparisons, we find that the integrated inner mass\nand density slope differences between objects formed in these three simulations\n(hereafter, H_AGN, H_noAGN and H_DM) significantly evolve with time. More\nspecifically, at high redshift (z~5), the mean central density profiles of\nH_AGN and H_noAGN dark matter haloes tend to be much steeper than their H_DM\ncounterparts owing to the rapidly growing baryonic component and ensuing\nadiabatic contraction. By z~1.5, these mean halo density profiles in H_AGN have\nflattened, pummelled by powerful AGN activity (\"quasar mode\"): the integrated\ninner mass difference gaps with H_noAGN haloes have widened, and those with\nH_DM haloes have narrowed. Fast forward 9.5 billion years, down to z=0, and the\ntrend reverses: H_AGN halo mean density profiles drift back to a more cusped\nshape as AGN feedback efficiency dwindles (\"radio mode\"), and the gaps in\nintegrated central mass difference with H_noAGN and H_DM close and broaden\nrespectively. On the galaxy side, the story differs noticeably. Averaged\nstellar profile central densities and inner slopes are monotonically reduced by\nAGN activity as a function of cosmic time, resulting in better agreement with\nlocal observations. As both dark matter and stellar inner density profiles\nrespond quite sensitively to the presence of a central AGN, there is hope that\nfuture observational determinations of these quantities can be used constrain\nAGN feedback models.\n", "  Noncommutative (NC) gravity is constructed on the canonical noncommutative\n(Moyal-Weyl) space-time as a noncommutative $SO(2,3)_\\star$ gauge theory. The\nNC gravity action consists of three different terms: the first term is of\nMac-Dowell Mansouri type, while the other two are generalizations of the\nEinstein-Hilbert action and the cosmological constant term. The expanded NC\ngravity action is then calculated using the Seiberg-Witten (SW) map and the\nexpansion is done up second order in the deformation parameter. We analyze in\ndetails the low energy sector of the full model. We calculate the equations of\nmotion, discuss their general properties and present one solution: the NC\ncorrection to Minkowski space-time. Using this solution, we explain breaking of\nthe diffeomorphism symmetry as a consequence of working in a particular\ncoordinate system given by the Fermi normal coordinates.\n", "  We took spatially resolved slit FORS2 spectra of 19 cluster galaxies at\nz=1.4, and 8 additional field galaxies at 1<z<1.2 using the ESO Very Large\nTelescope. The targets were selected from previous spectroscopic and\nphotometric campaigns. Our spectroscopy was complemented with HST-ACS imaging\nin the F775W and F850LP filters, which is mandatory to derive the galaxy\nstructural parameters accurately. We analyzed the ionized gas kinematics by\nextracting rotation curves from the two-dimensional spectra. Taking into\naccount all geometrical, observational, and instrumental effects, we used these\nrotation curves to derive the intrinsic maximum rotation velocity (Vmax). Vmax\nwas robustly determined for 6 cluster galaxies and 3 field galaxies. Galaxies\nwith sky contamination or insufficient spatial rotation curve extent were not\nincluded in our analysis. We compared our sample to the local B-band\nTully-Fisher relation (TFR) and the local Velocity-Size relation (VSR), finding\nthat cluster galaxies are on average 1.6 mags brighter and a factor 2-3\nsmaller. We tentatively divided our cluster galaxies by total mass (i.e., Vmax)\nto investigate a possible mass dependency in the environmental evolution of\ngalaxies. The average deviation from the local B-band TFR is -0.7 mags for the\nhigh-mass subsample. This mild evolution may be driven by younger stellar\npopulations of distant galaxies with respect to their local counterparts, and\nthus, an increasing luminosity is expected towards higher redshifts. However,\nthe low-mass group is made of 3 highly overluminous galaxies with average TFR\noffsets of -2.4 mags. This deviation can no longer be explained by the gradual\nevolution of SP with lookback time and thus, we suspect that we see rather\ncompact galaxies that got an enhancement of star formation during their infall\ntowards the dense regions of the cluster due to interactions with the\nintracluster medium.\n", "  We present a model for magnetic energy dissipation in a pulsar wind nebula.\nBetter understanding of this process is required to assess the likelihood that\ncertain astrophysical transients may be powered by the spin-down of a\n\"millisecond magnetar.\" Examples include superluminous supernovae, gamma-ray\nbursts, and anticipated electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave\ndetections of binary neutron star coalescence. Our model leverages recent\nprogress in the theory of turbulent magnetic relaxation to specify a\ndissipative closure of the stationary magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind equations,\nyielding predictions of the magnetic energy dissipation rate throughout the\nnebula. Synchrotron losses are treated self-consistently. To demonstrate the\nmodel's efficacy, we show that it can reproduce many features of the Crab\nNebula, including its expansion speed, radiative efficiency, peak photon\nenergy, and mean magnetic field strength. Unlike ideal MHD models of the Crab\n(which lead to the so-called sigma problem) our model accounts for the\ntransition from ultra to weakly magnetized plasma flow, and for the associated\nheating of relativistic electrons. We discuss how the predicted heating rates\nmay be utilized to improve upon models of particle transport and acceleration\nin pulsar wind nebulae. We also discuss implications for the Crab Nebula's\ngamma-ray flares, and point out potential modifications to models of\nastrophysical transients invoking the spin-down of a millisecond magnetar.\n", "  A scenario for gravitational particle creation in a stiff matter dominated\nflat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe is presented. The primary creation of\nscalar particles is calculated using quantum field theory in curved spacetime\nand it is found to be strongly dependent on the scalar mass and the expansion\nparameter of the universe. The particle creation is most effective for a very\nmassive scalar field and large expansion parameter. We apply the results to\ncosmology and calculate an upper bound for the equilibrium temperature of the\nsecondary particles created by the scalar field decay.\n", "  We discuss phenomenology of light scalar sgoldstino in context of CERN\nelectron beam dump experiment NA64. We calculate sgoldstino production rate for\nthis experiment taking into account sgoldstino mixing with the Higgs boson and\nfind a region in the model parameter space which can be tested in NA64.\n", "  We give a path integral formulation of the time evolution of qudits of odd\ndimension. This allows us to consider semiclassical evolution of discrete\nsystems in terms of an expansion of the propagator in powers of $\\hbar$. The\nlargest power of $\\hbar$ required to describe the evolution is a traditional\nmeasure of classicality. We show that the action of the Clifford operators on\nstabilizer states can be fully described by a single contribution of a path\nintegral truncated at order $\\hbar^0$ and so are \"classical,\" just like\npropagation of Gaussians under harmonic Hamiltonians in the continuous case.\nSuch operations have no dependence on phase or quantum interference.\nConversely, we show that supplementing the Clifford group with gates necessary\nfor universal quantum computation results in a propagator consisting of a\nfinite number of semiclassical path integral contributions truncated at order\n$\\hbar^1$ , a number that nevertheless scales exponentially with the number of\nqudits. The same sum in continuous systems has an infinite number of terms at\norder $\\hbar^1$.\n", "  We describe a strategy for code modernisation of Gadget, a widely used\ncommunity code for computational astrophysics. The focus of this work is on\nnode-level performance optimisation, targeting current multi/many-core IntelR\narchitectures. We identify and isolate a sample code kernel, which is\nrepresentative of a typical Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) algorithm.\nThe code modifications include threading parallelism optimisation, change of\nthe data layout into Structure of Arrays (SoA), auto-vectorisation and\nalgorithmic improvements in the particle sorting. We obtain shorter execution\ntime and improved threading scalability both on Intel XeonR ($2.6 \\times$ on\nIvy Bridge) and Xeon PhiTM ($13.7 \\times$ on Knights Corner) systems. First few\ntests of the optimised code result in $19.1 \\times$ faster execution on second\ngeneration Xeon Phi (Knights Landing), thus demonstrating the portability of\nthe devised optimisation solutions to upcoming architectures.\n", "  Systems that exhibit topologically protected edge states are interesting both\nfrom a fundamental point of view as well as for potential applications, the\nlatter because of the absence of back-scattering and robustness to\nperturbations. It is desirable to be able to control and manipulate such edge\nstates. Here, we show that artificial square ices can incorporate both\nfeatures: an interfacial Dzyaloshinksii-Moriya gives rise to topologically\nnon-trivial magnon bands, and the equilibrium state of the spin ice is\nreconfigurable with different configurations having different magnon\ndispersions and topology. The topology is found to develop as odd-symmetry bulk\nand edge magnon bands approach each other, so that constructive band inversion\noccurs in reciprocal space. Our results show that topologically protected bands\nare supported in square spin ices.\n", "  We determine Mg abundances in 6 Gaia benchmark stars using theoretical\none-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic model atmospheres, as well as temporally- and\nspatially-averaged 3D model atmospheres (<3D>). The stars cover a range of Teff\nfrom 4700 to 6500 K, log g from 1.6 to 4.4 dex, and [Fe/H] from -3.0 dex to\nsolar. Spectrum synthesis calculations are performed in local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE) and in non-LTE (NLTE) using the oscillator strengths recently\npublished by Pehlivan Rhodin et al. We find that: a) Mg abundances determined\nfrom the infrared spectra are as accurate as the optical diagnostics, b) the\nNLTE effects on Mg I line strengths and abundances in this sample of stars are\nminor (although for a few Mg I lines the NLTE effects on abundance exceed 0.6\ndex in <3D> and 0.1 dex in 1D, c) the solar Mg abundance is 7.56 +/- 0.05 dex\n(total error), in the excellent agreement with the Mg abundance measured in CI\nchondritic meteorites, d) the 1D NLTE and <3D> NLTE approach can be used with\nconfidence to analyse optical Mg I lines in spectra of dwarfs and sub-giants,\nbut for red giants the Mg I 5711 A line should be preferred, e) low-excitation\nMg I lines are sensitive to the atmospheric structure; for these lines, LTE\ncalculations with <3D> models lead to significant systematic abundance errors.\nThe methods developed in this work will be used to study Mg abundances of a\nlarge sample of stars in the next paper in the series.\n", "  We present an effcient experimental procedure that certifies non vanishing\nquantum capacities for qubit noisy channels. Our method is based on the use of\na fixed bipartite entangled state, where the system qubit is sent to the\nchannel input. A particular set of local measurements is performed at the\nchannel output and the ancilla qubit mode, obtaining lower bounds to the\nquantum capacities for any unknown channel with no need of a quantum process\ntomography. The entangled qubits have a Bell state configuration and are\nencoded in photon polarization. The lower bounds are found by estimating the\nShannon and von Neumann entropies at the output using an optimized basis, whose\nstatistics is obtained by measuring only the three observables\n$\\sigma_{x}\\otimes\\sigma_{x}$, $\\sigma_{y}\\otimes\\sigma_{y}$ and\n$\\sigma_{z}\\otimes\\sigma_{z}$.\n", "  For a perturbation of the state of a Conformal Field Theory (CFT), the\nresponse of the entanglement entropy is governed by the so-called \"first law\"\nof entanglement entropy, in which the change in entanglement entropy is\nproportional to the change in energy. Whether such a first law holds for other\ntypes of perturbations, such as a change to the CFT Lagrangian, remains an open\nquestion. We use holography to study the evolution in time $t$ of entanglement\nentropy for a CFT driven by a $t$-linear source for a conserved $U(1)$ current\nor marginal scalar operator. We find that although the usual first law of\nentanglement entropy may be violated, a first law for the rates of change of\nentanglement entropy and energy still holds. More generally, we prove that this\nfirst law for rates holds in holography for any asymptotically\n$(d+1)$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter metric perturbation whose $t$ dependence\nfirst appears at order $z^d$ in the Fefferman-Graham expansion about the\nboundary at $z=0$.\n", "  Time crystals are proposed states of matter which spontaneously break time\ntranslation symmetry. There is no settled definition of such states. We offer a\nnew definition which follows the traditional recipe for Wigner symmetries and\norder parameters. Supplementing our definition with a few plausible assumptions\nwe find that a) systems with time independent Hamiltonians should not exhibit\nTTSB while b) the recently studied $\\pi$ spin glass/Floquet time crystal can be\nviewed as breaking a global internal symmetry and as breaking time translation\nsymmetry as befits its two names.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of a young merging galaxy cluster\n\\mac~(z=0.43), from {\\it Chandra} X-ray and {\\it Hubble Space Telescope}\narchival data. X-ray observations confirm that the X-ray emitting intra-cluster\nmedium (ICM) in this system is among the hottest (average $T=12.1 \\pm 0.6$ keV)\nand most luminous known. Comparison of X-ray and optical images confirm that\nthis system hosts two merging subclusters SC1 and SC2, separated by a projected\ndistance of about 650\\,kpc. The subcluster SC2 is newly identified in this\nwork, while another subcluster (SC0), previously thought to be part of this\nmerging system, is shown to be possibly a foreground object. Apart from two\nsubclusters, we find a tail-like structure in the X-ray image, extending to a\nprojected distance of $\\sim$1\\,Mpc, along the north-east direction of the\neastern subcluster (SC1). From a surface brightness analysis, we detect two\nsharp surface brightness edges at $\\sim$40$\\arcsec$ ($\\sim$320\\,kpc) and\n$\\sim$80$\\arcsec$ ($\\sim$640\\,kpc) to the east of SC1. The inner edge appears\nto be associated with a merger-driven cold front, while the outer one is likely\nto be due to a shock front, the presence of which, ahead of the cold front,\nmakes this dynamically disturbed cluster interesting. Nearly all the early-type\ngalaxies belonging to the two subclusters, including their BCGs, are part of a\nwell-defined red sequence.\n", "  We consider the Aharonov-Bohm effect on entanglement entropy for one interval\nin (1+1) dimensional conformal field theory on a one dimensional ring. The\nmagnetic field is confined inside the ring, i.e. there is a Wilson loop on the\nring. The Aharonov-Bohm phase factor which is proportional to the Wilson loop\nis represented as insertion of twist operators. We compute exactly the Renyi\nentropy from a four point function of twist operators in a free charged scalar\nfield.\n", "  We provide a universal expression of cross sections for the exclusive vector\nmeson production and Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) in photon-proton\nand photon-nucleus interactions based on the geometric scaling phenomenon. The\ntheoretical parameterization based on the scaling property depends only on the\nsingle variable $\\tau_A = Q^2/Q_{\\mathrm{sat}}^2$, where the saturation scale,\n$Q_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, drives the energy dependence and the corresponding nuclear\neffects. This phenomenological result describes all available data from\nDESY-HERA for $\\rho,\\,\\phi,\\,J/\\psi$ production and DVCS measurements. A\ndiscussion on the size of nuclear shadowing corrections on photon-nucleus\ninteraction is also done.\n", "  This paper addresses the question of observability of neutral Higgs bosons\nthrough the leptonic decay in a two Higgs doublet model (2HDM). Both scalar and\npseudoscalar Higgs bosons ($H,~A$) are considered. The model is set to type IV\nto enhance the leptonic decay. In such a scenario, a signal production process\nlike $e^+e^- \\to A^0H^0 \\to \\tau\\tau \\mu\\mu$ or $\\mu\\mu\\tau\\tau$ would provide\na clear signal on top of the background in a di-muon invariant mass\ndistribution far from the $Z$ boson pole mass. The analysis is based on a\n$\\tau$-id algorithm which preselects events if they have two $\\tau$ jets by\nrequiring a hadronic $\\tau$ decay. Several benchmark points are defined for the\nsearch, requiring a linear collider operating at $\\sqrt{s} =$ 0.5 and 1 TeV. It\nis shown that the signal can be observed on top of the background in all\nbenchmark points at an integrated luminosity of 1000 $fb^{-1}$.\n", "  The objective of this paper is to use transfer functions to comprehend the\nformation of band gaps in locally resonant acoustic metamaterials. Identifying\na recursive approach for any number of serially arranged locally resonant mass\nin mass cells, a closed form expression for the transfer function is derived.\nAnalysis of the end-to-end transfer function helps identify the fundamental\nmechanism for the band gap formation in a finite metamaterial. This mechanism\nincludes (a) repeated complex conjugate zeros located at the natural frequency\nof the individual local resonators, (b) the presence of two poles which flank\nthe band gap, and (c) the absence of poles in the band-gap. Analysis of the\nfinite cell dynamics are compared to the Bloch-wave analysis of infinitely long\nmetamaterials to confirm the theoretical limits of the band gap estimated by\nthe transfer function modeling. The analysis also explains how the band gap\nevolves as the number of cells in the metamaterial chain increases and\nhighlights how the response varies depending on the chosen sensing location\nalong the length of the metamaterial. The proposed transfer function approach\nto compute and evaluate band gaps in locally resonant structures provides a\nframework for the exploitation of control techniques to modify and tune band\ngaps in finite metamaterial realizations.\n", "  We find the $\\ell$-weights and the $\\ell$-weight vectors for the highest\n$\\ell$-weight $q$-oscillator representations of the positive Borel subalgebra\nof the quantum loop algebra $U_q(\\mathcal L(\\mathfrak{sl}_{l+1}))$ for\narbitrary values of $l$. Having this, we establish the explicit relationship\nbetween the $q$-oscillator and prefundamental representations. Our\nconsideration allows us to conclude that the prefundamental representations can\nbe obtained by tensoring $q$-oscillator representations.\n", "  ImageJ is a graphical user interface (GUI) driven, public domain, Java-based,\nsoftware package for general image processing traditionally used mainly in life\nsciences fields. The image processing capabilities of ImageJ are useful and\nextendable to other scientific fields. Here we present AstroImageJ (AIJ), which\nprovides an astronomy specific image display environment and tools for\nastronomy specific image calibration and data reduction. Although AIJ maintains\nthe general purpose image processing capabilities of ImageJ, AIJ is streamlined\nfor time-series differential photometry, light curve detrending and fitting,\nand light curve plotting, especially for applications requiring ultra-precise\nlight curves (e.g., exoplanet transits). AIJ reads and writes standard FITS\nfiles, as well as other common image formats, provides FITS header viewing and\nediting, and is World Coordinate System (WCS) aware, including an automated\ninterface to the astrometry.net web portal for plate solving images. AIJ\nprovides research grade image calibration and analysis tools with a GUI driven\napproach, and easily installed cross-platform compatibility. It enables new\nusers, even at the level of undergraduate student, high school student, or\namateur astronomer, to quickly start processing, modeling, and plotting\nastronomical image data with one tightly integrated software package.\n", "  A central challenge in modern condensed matter physics is developing the\ntools for understanding nontrivial yet unordered states of matter. One\nimportant idea to emerge in this context is that of a \"pseudogap\": the fact\nthat under appropriate circumstances the normal state displays a suppression of\nthe single particle spectral density near the Fermi level, reminiscent of the\ngaps seen in ordered states of matter. While these concepts arose in a solid\nstate context, it is now being explored in cold gases. This article reviews the\ncurrent experimental and theoretical understanding of the normal state of\nstrongly interacting Fermi gases, with particular focus on the phenomonology\nwhich is traditionally associated with the pseudogap.\n", "  Ultrafast optical pump - optical probe and optical pump - terahertz probe\nspectroscopy were performed on vanadium dioxide (VO2) and vanadium sesquioxide\n(V2O3) thin films over a wide temperature range. A comparison of the\nexperimental data from these two different techniques and two different\nvanadium oxides, in particular a comparison of the electronic oscillations\ngenerated by the photoinduced longitudinal acoustic modulation, reveals the\nstrong electron-phonon coupling that exists in the metallic state of both\nmaterials. The low energy Drude response of V2O3 appears more susceptible than\nVO2 to ultrafast strain control. Additionally, our results provide a\nmeasurement of the temperature dependence of the sound velocity in both\nsystems, revealing a four- to fivefold increase in VO2 and a three- to fivefold\nincrease in V2O3 across the phase transition. Our data also confirm\nobservations of strong damping and phonon anharmonicity in the metallic phase\nof VO2, and suggest that a similar phenomenon might be at play in the metallic\nphase of V2O3. More generally, our simple table-top approach provides relevant\nand detailed information about dynamical lattice properties of vanadium oxides,\nopening the way to similar studies in other complex materials.\n", "  In Si, spin-phonon interaction is the primary spin relaxation mechanism. At\nlow temperatures, the absence of spin-phonon relaxation will lead to enhanced\nspin accumulation. Spin accumulation may change the electro-thermal transport\nwithin the material, and thus may serve as an investigative tool for\ncharacterizing spin-mediated behavior. Here we present the first experimental\nproof of spin accumulation induced electro-thermal transport behavior in a Pd\n(1 nm)/Ni80Fe20 (25 nm)/MgO (1 nm)/p-Si (2 um) specimen. The spin accumulation\noriginates from the spin-Hall effect. The spin accumulation changes the\nphononic thermal transport in p-Si causing the observed magneto-electro-thermal\ntransport behavior. We also observe the inverted switching behavior in\nmagnetoresistance measurement at low temperatures in contrast to magnetic\ncharacterization, which is attributed to the canted spin states in p-Si due to\nspin accumulation. The spin accumulation is elucidated by current dependent\nanomalous Hall resistance measurement, which shows a decrease as the electric\ncurrent is increased. This result may open a new paradigm in the field of\nspin-mediated transport behavior in semiconductor and semiconductor\nspintronics.\n", "  We use Lagrangian effective field theory techniques to construct the\nequations of motion for an ideal relativistic fluid whose constituent degrees\nof freedom have microscopic polarization. We discuss the meaning of such a\nsystem, and argue that it is the first term in the EFT appropriate for\ndescribing polarization observables in heavy ion collisions, such as final\nstate particle polarization and chiral magnetic and vortaic effects. We show\nthat this system will generally require non-dissipative dynamics at higher\norder in gradient than second order, leading to potential stability issues\nknown with such systems. We comment on the significance of this in the light of\nconjectured lower limits on viscosity.\n", "  We construct a group field theory model for quantum gravity minimally coupled\nto relativistic scalar fields, defining as well a corresponding discrete\ngravity path integral (and, implicitly, a coupled spin foam model) in its\nFeynman expansion. We also analyze a number of variations of the same model,\nthe corresponding discrete gravity path integrals, its generalization to the\ncoupling of multiple scalar fields and discuss its possible applications to the\nextraction of effective cosmological dynamics from the full quantum gravity\nformalism, in the context of group field theory condensate cosmology.\n", "  The following comment is based on an article by M. Jafarpour and L. Assadi\n[Eur. Phys. J. D 70, 62 (2016), doi:10.1140/epjd/e2016-60555-5] which with an\nexploitation of Scott measure (or generalized Meyer-Wallach measure) the\nentanglement quantity of four-qubit graph states has been calculated. We are to\nreveal that the Scott measure (Q_m) nominates limits for m which would prevent\nus from calculating Q_3 in four-qubit system. Incidentally in a counterexample\nwe will confirm as it was recently concluded in the mentioned article, the Q_2\nquantity is not necessarily always greater than Q_3.\n", "  Determination of the quantum nature of correlations between two spatially\nseparated systems plays a crucial role in quantum information science. Of\nparticular interest is the questions of if and how these correlations enable\nquantum information protocols to be more powerful. Here, we report on a\ndistributed quantum computation protocol in which the input and output quantum\nstates are considered to be classically correlated in quantum informatics.\nNevertheless, we show that the correlations between the outcomes of the\nmeasurements on the output state cannot be efficiently simulated using\nclassical algorithms. Crucially, at the same time, local measurement outcomes\ncan be efficiently simulated on classical computers. We show that the only\nknown classicality criterion violated by the input and output states in our\nprotocol is the one used in quantum optics, namely, phase-space\nnonclassicality. As a result, we argue that the global phase-space\nnonclassicality inherent within the output state of our protocol represents\ntrue quantum correlations.\n", "  We propose two new analysis strategies for studying charm and beauty quarks\nat colliders. The first strategy is aimed at testing the kinematics of\nheavy-flavor quarks within an identified jet. Here, we use the SoftDrop\njet-declustering algorithm to identify two subjets within a large-radius jet,\nusing subjet flavor tagging to test the heavy-quark splitting functions of QCD.\nFor subjets containing a $J / \\psi$ or $\\Upsilon$, this declustering technique\ncan also help probe the mechanism for quarkonium production. The second\nstrategy is aimed at isolating heavy-flavor production from gluon splitting.\nHere, we introduce a new FlavorCone algorithm, which smoothly interpolates from\nwell-separated heavy-quark jets to the gluon-splitting regime where jets\noverlap. Because of its excellent ability to identify charm and beauty hadrons,\nthe LHCb detector is ideally suited to pursue these strategies, though similar\nmeasurements should also be possible at ATLAS and CMS. Together, these SoftDrop\nand FlavorCone studies should clarify a number of aspects of heavy-flavor\nphysics at colliders, and provide crucial information needed to improve\nheavy-flavor modeling in parton-shower generators.\n", "  High-temperature, high-dose, neutron irradiation of W results in the\nformation of Re-rich clusters at concentrations one order of magnitude lower\nthan the thermodynamic solubility limit. These clusters may eventually\ntransform into brittle W-Re intermetallic phases, which can lead to high levels\nof hardening and thermal conductivity losses. Standard theories of radiation\nenhanced diffusion and precipitation cannot explain the formation of these\nprecipitates and so understanding the mechanism by which nonequilibrium\nclusters form under irradiation is crucial to predict materials degradation and\ndevise mitigation strategies. Here we carry out a thermodynamic study of W-Re\nalloys and conduct kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of Re cluster formation in\nirradiated W-2Re alloys using a generalized Hamiltonian for crystals containing\npoint defects parameterized entirely with electronic structure calculations.\nOur model incorporates recently-gained mechanistic information of\nmixed-interstitial solute transport, which is seen to control cluster\nnucleation and growth by forming quasi-spherical nuclei after an average\nincubation time of 20 s at 1800 K. These nuclei are seen to grow by attracting\nmore mixed interstitials bringing solute atoms, which in turns attracts\nvacancies leading to recombination and solute agglomeration. The clusters grow\nto a maximum size of approximately 4-nm radius, and are not fully dense with\nRe, containing 50% or less near the center. Our simulations are in reasonable\nagreement with recent atom probe examinations of ion irradiated W-2Re systems\nat 773 K.\n", "  We perform realistic simulations of the current and future long baseline\nexperiments such as T2K, NO$\\nu$A, DUNE and T2HK in order to determine their\nultimate potential in probing neutrino oscillation parameters. We quantify the\npotential of these experiments to underpin the octant of the atmospheric angle\n$\\theta_{23}$ as well as the value and sign of the CP phase $\\delta_{CP}$.\n", "  We report modulation of a reversible phase transition in VO2 films by\nhydrogen doping. A metallic phase and a new insulating phase are successively\nobserved at room temperature as the doping concentration increases. It is\nsuggested that the polarized charges from doped hydrogens play an important\nrole. These charges gradually occupy V3d-O2p hybridized orbitals and\nconsequently modulate the filling of the VO2 crystal conduction band-edge\nstates, which eventually evolve into new valence band-edge states. This\ndemonstrates the exceptional sensitivity of VO2 electronic properties to\nelectron concentration and orbital occupancy, providing key information for the\nphase transition mechanism.\n", "  Here, the Abraham-Minkowski controversy on the correct definition of the\nlight momentum in a macroscopic medium is revisited with the purpose to\nhighlight that an effective medium formalism necessarily restricts the\navailable information on the internal state of a system, and that this is\nultimately the reason why the dilemma has no universal solution. Despite these\ndifficulties, it is demonstrated that in the limit of no material absorption\nand under steady-state conditions, the time-averaged light (kinetic) momentum\nmay be unambiguously determined by the Abraham result, both for bodies at rest\nand for circulatory flows of matter. The implications of these findings are\ndiscussed in the context of quantum optics of moving media, and we examine in\ndetail the fundamental role of the Minkowski momentum in such a context.\n", "  We report a detailed study of the magnetization modulus as a function of\ntemperature and applied magnetic field under varying angle in\nSr$_{4}$Ru$_{3}$O$_{10}$ close to the metamagnetic transition at\n$H_{c}\\backsimeq 2.5\\,$T for $H \\perp c$. We confirm that the double-feature at\n$H_{c}$ is robust without further splitting for temperatures below 1.8 K down\nto 0.48 K. The metamagnetism in Sr$_{4}$Ru$_{3}$O$_{10}$ is accompanied by a\nreduction of the magnetic moment in the plane of rotation and large\nfield-hysteretic behavior. The double anomaly shifts to higher fields by\nrotating the field from $H\\,\\perp \\,c$ to $H\\,\\parallel\\,c$. We compare our\nexperimental findings with numerical simulations based on spin reorientation\nmodels caused by intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Zeeman effect.\nCrystal anisotropy is able to explain a metamagnetic transition in the\nferromagnetic ordered system Sr$_{4}$Ru$_{3}$O$_{10}$, but a\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya term is crucial to account for a reduction of the\nmagnetic moment as discovered in the experiments.\n", "  Quality of individual photons and their ability to interfere is traditionally\ntested by measuring the Hong-Ou-Mandel photon bunching effect. However, this\nphase insensitive measurement only tests the particle aspect of the quantum\ninterference. Motivated by these limitations, we formulate a witness capable of\nrecognizing both the quality and the coherence of two photons from a single set\nof measurements. We exploit the conditional nonclassical squeezing which is\nsensitive to both the quality of the single photons and their\nindistinguishability and we show that it can be used to irectly reveal both the\nparticle and the wave aspects of the quantum interference. Finally, we\nexperimentally test the witness by applying it to a pair of independent single\nphotons generated on demand.\n", "  During the next solar maximum, two upcoming space-borne X-ray missions, STIX\non board Solar Orbiter and MiSolFA, will perform stereoscopic X-ray\nobservations of solar flares at two different locations: STIX at 0.28 AU (at\nperihelion) and up to inclinations of $\\sim25^{\\circ}$, and MiSolFA in a\nlow-Earth orbit. The combined observations from these cross-calibrated\ndetectors will allow us to infer the electron anisotropy of individual flares\nconfidently for the first time. We simulated both instrumental and physical\neffects for STIX and MiSolFA including thermal shielding, background and X-ray\nCompton backscattering (albedo effect) in the solar photosphere. We predict the\nexpected number of observable flares available for stereoscopic measurements\nduring the next solar maximum. We also discuss the range of useful spacecraft\nobservation angles for the challenging case of close-to-isotropic flare\nanisotropy. The simulated results show that STIX and MiSolFA will be capable of\ndetecting low levels of flare anisotropy, for M1-class or stronger flares, even\nwith a relatively small spacecraft angular separation of 20-30{\\deg}. Both\ninstruments will directly measure the flare X-ray anisotropy of about 40 M- and\nX-class solar flares during the next solar maximum. Near-future stereoscopic\nobservations with Solar Orbiter/STIX and MiSolFA will help distinguishing\nbetween competing flare-acceleration mechanisms, and provide essential\nconstraints regarding collisional and non-collisional transport processes\noccurring in the flaring atmosphere for individual solar flares.\n", "  We employ a weak measurement approach to demonstrate the very existence of\nthe photoexcited interband superposition states in intrinsic graphene. We\npropose an optical two-beam setup where such measurements are possible and\nderive an explicit formula for the differential optical absorption that\ncontains a signature of such states. We provide an interpretation of our\nresults in terms of a non-Markovian weak measurement formalism applied to the\npseudospin degree of freedom coupled with an electromagnetic wave.\n", "  In stimulated Raman scattering, two incident optical waves induce a force\noscillating at the difference of the two light frequencies. This process has\nenabled important applications such as the excitation and coherent control of\nphonons and magnons by femtosecond laser pulses. Here, we experimentally and\ntheoretically demonstrate the so far neglected up-conversion counterpart of\nthis process: THz sum-frequency excitation of a Raman-active phonon mode, which\nis tantamount to two-photon absorption by an optical transition between two\nadjacent vibrational levels. Coherent control of an optical lattice vibration\nof diamond is achieved by an intense terahertz pulse whose spectrum is centered\nat half the phonon frequency of 40 THz. Remarkably, the carrier-envelope phase\nof the driving pulse is directly imprinted on the lattice vibration. New\nprospects in infrared spectroscopy, light storage schemes and lattice\ntrajectory control in the electronic ground state emerge.\n", "  Avenues of Majorana bound states (MBSs) have become one of the primary\ndirections towards a possible realization of topological quantum computation.\nFor a Y-junction of Kitaev quantum wires, we numerically investigate the\nbraiding of MBSs while considering the full quasi-particle background. The two\ncentral sources of braiding errors are found to be the fidelity loss due to the\nincomplete adiabaticity of the braiding operation as well as the hybridization\nof the MBS. The explicit extraction of the braiding phase in the low-energy\nMajorana sector from the full many-particle Hilbert space allows us to analyze\nthe breakdown of the independent-particle picture of Majorana braiding.\nFurthermore, we find nearest-neighbor interactions to significantly affect the\nbraiding performance to the better or worse, depending on the sign and\nmagnitude of the coupling.\n", "  In this Letter we experimentally demonstrate the generation of squeezed,\nbright twin beams which arise due to competing gain and absorption, in a medium\nthat is overall transparent. To accomplish this, we make use of a\nnon-degenerate four-wave mixing process in warm potassium vapor, such that one\nof the twin beams experiences strong on-resonant absorption. At room\ntemperature and above, due to Doppler broadening and smaller frequency\ndetunings compared to other schemes, the ground state hyperfine splittings used\nin the present double-$\\Lambda$ setup are completely overlapped. We show that\ndespite the resulting significant asymmetric absorption of the twin beams,\nquantum correlations may still be generated. Our results also demonstrate that\nthe simplified model of gain, followed by loss, is insufficient to describe the\namount of quantum correlation resulting from the process.\n", "  In this paper, we combine the $\\nu$-Two-Higgs-Doublet-Model ($\\nu$THDM) with\nthe inverse seesaw mechanisms. In this model, the Yukawa couplings involving\nthe sterile neutrinos and the exotic Higgs bosons can be of order one in the\ncase of a large $\\tan \\beta$. We calculated the corrections to the Z-resonance\nparameters $R_{l_i}$, $A_{l_i}$, $N_{\\nu}$, together with the $l_1 \\rightarrow\nl_2 \\gamma$ branching ratios, and the muon anomalous $g-2$. Compared with the\ncurrent bounds and plans for the future colliders, we find that the corrections\nto the electroweak parameters can be contrained or discovered in much of the\nparameter space.\n", "  Motivated by recent measurements of the number density of faint AGN at high\nredshift, we investigate the contribution of quasars to reionization by\ntracking the growth of central supermassive black holes in an update of the\nMeraxes semi-analytic model. The model is calibrated against the observed\nstellar mass function at $z\\sim0.6-7$, the black hole mass function at\n$z\\lesssim0.5$, the global ionizing emissivity at $z\\sim2-5$ and the Thomson\nscattering optical depth. The model reproduces a Magorrian relation in\nagreement with observations at $z<0.5$ and predicts a decreasing black hole\nmass towards higher redshifts at fixed total stellar mass. With the\nimplementation of an opening angle of 80 deg for quasar radiation,\ncorresponding to an observable fraction of ${\\sim}23.4$ per cent due to\nobscuration by dust, the model is able to reproduce the observed quasar\nluminosity function at $z\\sim0.6-6$. The stellar light from galaxies hosting\nfaint AGN contributes a significant or dominant fraction of the UV flux. At\nhigh redshift, the model is consistent with the bright end quasar luminosity\nfunction and suggests that the recent faint $z\\sim4$ AGN sample compiled by\nGiallongo et al. (2015) includes a significant fraction of stellar light.\nDirect application of this luminosity function to the calculation of AGN\nionizing emissivity consequently overestimates the number of ionizing photons\nproduced by quasars by a factor of 3 at $z\\sim6$. We conclude that quasars are\nunlikely to make a significant contribution to reionization.\n", "  We investigate the nonequilibrium response of quasiperiodic systems to\nboundary driving. In particular we focus on the Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper model at\nits metal-insulator transition and the diagonal Fibonacci model. We find that\nopening the system at the boundaries provides a transparent and experimentally\nviable technique to probe its underlying fractality, which is reflected in the\nfractal spatial dependence of simple observables (such as magnetization) in the\nnonequilibrium steady state. We also find that the dynamics in the\nnonequilibrium steady state depends on the length of the chain chosen: generic\nlength chains harbour qualitatively slower transport (different scaling\nexponent) than Fibonacci length chains, which is in turn slower than in the\nclosed system. We conjecture that such fractal nonequilibrium steady states\nshould arise in generic driven critical systems that have fractal properties.\n", "  Let $X = \\{1,-1\\}^\\mathbb{N}$ be the symbolic space endowed with the product\norder. A Borel probability measure $\\mu$ over $X$ is said to satisfy the FKG\ninequality if for any pair of continuous increasing functions $f$ and $g$ we\nhave $\\mu(fg)-\\mu(f)\\mu(g)\\geq 0$.\n  In the first part of the paper we prove the validity of the FKG inequality on\nThermodynamic Formalism setting for a class of eigenmeasures of the dual of the\nRuelle operator, including several examples of interest in Statistical\nMechanics. In addition to deducing this inequality in cases not covered by\nclassical results about attractive specifications our proof has advantage of to\nbe easily adapted for suitable subshifts. We review (and provide proofs in our\nsetting) some classical results about the long-range Ising model on the lattice\n$\\mathbb{N}$ and use them to deduce some monotonicity properties of the\nassociated Ruelle operator and their relations with phase transitions.\n  As is widely known, for some continuous potentials does not exists a positive\ncontinuous eigenfunction associated to the spectral radius of the Ruelle\noperator acting on $C(X)$. Here we employed some ideas related to the\ninvolution kernel in order to solve the main eigenvalue problem in a suitable\nsense - for a class of potentials having low regularity. From this we obtain an\nexplicit tight upper bound for the main eigenvalue (consequently for the\npressure) of the Ruelle operator associated to Ising models with\n$1/r^{2+\\varepsilon}$ interaction energy. Extensions of the Ruelle operator to\nsuitable Hilbert Spaces are considered and a theorem solving to the main\neigenvalue problem (in a weak sense) is obtained by using the Lions-Lax-Milgram\ntheorem.\n", "  The scalar-tensor theory of Damour and Esposito-Far\\`ese recently gained some\nrenewed interest because of its ability to suppress modifications to General\nRelativity in the weak field, while introducing large corrections in the strong\nfield of compact objects through a process called scalarization. A large sector\nof this theory that allows for scalarization, however, has been shown to be in\nconflict with Solar System observations when accounting for the cosmological\nevolution of the scalar field. We here study an extension of this theory by\nendowing the scalar field with a mass to determine whether this allows the\ntheory to pass Solar System constraints upon cosmological evolution for a\nlarger sector of coupling parameter space. We show that the cosmological scalar\nfield goes first through a quiescent phase, similar to the behavior of a\nmassless field, but then it enters an oscillatory phase, with an amplitude (and\nfrequency) that decays (and grows) exponentially. We further show that after\nthe field enters the oscillatory phase, its effective energy density and\npressure are approximately those of dust, as expected from previous\ncosmological studies. Due to these oscillations, we show that the scalar field\ncannot be treated as static today on astrophysical scales, and so we use\ntime-dependent perturbation theory to compute the scalar-field-induced\nmodifications to Solar System observables. We find that these modifications are\nsuppressed when the mass of the scalar field and the coupling parameter of the\ntheory are in a wide range, allowing the theory to pass Solar System\nconstraints, while in principle possibly still allowing for scalarization.\n", "  The possibly unbiased selection process in surveys of the Sunyaev Zel'dovich\neffect can unveil new populations of galaxy clusters. We performed a weak\nlensing analysis of the PSZ2LenS sample, i.e. the PSZ2 galaxy clusters detected\nby the Planck mission in the sky portion covered by the lensing surveys\nCFHTLenS and RCSLenS. PSZ2LenS consists of 35 clusters and it is a\nstatistically complete and homogeneous subsample of the PSZ2 catalogue. The\nPlanck selected clusters appear to be unbiased tracers of the massive end of\nthe cosmological haloes. The mass concentration relation of the sample is in\nexcellent agreement with predictions from the Lambda cold dark matter model.\nThe stacked lensing signal is detected at 14 sigma significance over the radial\nrange 0.1<R<3.2 Mpc/h, and is well described by the cuspy dark halo models\npredicted by numerical simulations. We confirmed that Planck estimated masses\nare biased low by b_SZ= 27+-11(stat)+-8(sys) per cent with respect to weak\nlensing masses. The bias is higher for the cosmological subsample, b_SZ=\n40+-14+-(stat)+-8(sys) per cent.\n", "  Quantum triangles can work as interferometers. Depending on their geometric\nsize and interactions between paths, \"beats\" {\\it and/or} \"steps\" patterns are\nobserved. We show that when inter-level distances between level positions in\nquantum triangles periodically change with time, formation of beats {\\it\nand/or} steps no longer depends only on the geometric size of the triangles but\nalso on the characteristic frequency of the transverse signal. For large-size\ntriangles, we observe the coexistence of beats {\\it and} steps when the\nfrequency of the signal matches that of non-adiabatic oscillations and for\nlarge frequencies, a maximum of four steps instead of two as in the case with\nconstant interactions is observed. Small-size triangles also revealed\ncounter-intuitive interesting dynamics for large frequencies of the field:\nunexpected two-step patterns are observed. When the frequency is large and\ntuned such that it matches the uniaxial anisotropy, three-step patterns are\nobserved. We have equally observed that when the transverse signal possesses a\nstatic part, steps maximize to six. These effects are semi-classically\nexplained in terms of Fresnel integrals and quantum mechanically in terms of\nquantized fields with a photon-induced tunneling process. Our expressions for\npopulations are in excellent agreement with the gross temporal profiles of\nexact numerical solutions. We compare the semi-classical and quantum dynamics\nin the triangle and establish the conditions for their equivalence.\n", "  We report a study of the magnetic field dependence of photoluminescence of\nNV$^-$ centers (negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers) in diamond single\ncrystals. In such a magnetic field dependence characteristic sharp features are\nobserved, which are coming from Level Anti-Crossings (LACs) in a coupled\nelectron-nuclear spin system. For sensitive detection of such LAC-lines we use\nlock-in detection to measure the photoluminescence intensity. This experimental\ntechnique allows us to obtain new LAC lines. Additionally, a remarkably strong\ndependence of the LAC-lines on the modulation frequency is found. Specifically,\nupon decrease of the modulation frequency from 12 kHz to 17 Hz the amplitude of\nthe LAC-lines increases by approximately two orders of magnitude. To take a\nquantitative account for such effects, we present a theoretical model, which\ndescribes the spin dynamics in a coupled electron-nuclear spin system under the\naction of an oscillating external magnetic field. Good agreement between\nexperiments and theory allows us to conclude that the observed effects are\noriginating from coherent spin polarization exchange in a coupled spin system\ncomprising the spin-polarized NV$^-$ center. Our results are of great practical\nimportance allowing one to optimize the experimental conditions for probing\nLAC-derived lines in diamond crystals comprising NV$^-$ centers and for\nindirect detection and identification of other paramagnetic defect centers.\n", "  A striking signal of dark matter beyond the standard model is the existence\nof cores in the centre of galaxy clusters. Recent simulations predict that a\nBrightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) inside a cored galaxy cluster will exhibit\nresidual wobbling due to previous major mergers, long after the relaxation of\nthe overall cluster. This phenomenon is absent with standard cold dark matter\nwhere a cuspy density profile keeps a BCG tightly bound at the centre. We test\nthis hypothesis using cosmological simulations and deep observations of 10\ngalaxy clusters acting as strong gravitational lenses. Modelling the BCG wobble\nas a simple harmonic oscillator, we measure the wobble amplitude, $A_w$, in the\nBAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, finding an upper\nlimit for the CDM paradigm of $A_w < 2$kpc at the 95% confidence limit. We\ncarry out the same test on the data finding a non-zero amplitude of\n$A_w=11.82^{+7.3}_{-3.0}$kpc, with the observations dis-favouring $A_w = 0$ at\nthe 3$\\sigma$ confidence level. This detection of BCG wobbling is evidence for\na dark matter core at the heart of galaxy clusters. It also shows that strong\nlensing models of clusters cannot assume that the BCG is exactly coincident\nwith the large scale halo. While our small sample of galaxy clusters already\nindicates a non-zero $A_w$, with larger surveys, e.g. Euclid, we will be able\nto not only to confirm the effect but also to use it to determine whether or\nnot the wobbling finds its origin in new fundamental physics or astrophysical\nprocess.\n", "  We demonstrate that the measurement of $1/f^{\\alpha}$ noise at the single\nmolecule or nano-object limit is remarkably distinct from the macroscopic\nmeasurement over a large sample. The single particle measurements yield a\nconditional time-dependent spectrum. However, the number of units fluctuating\non the time scale of the experiment is increasing in such a way that the\nmacroscopic measurements appear perfectly stationary. The single particle power\nspectrum is a conditional spectrum, in the sense that we must make a\ndistinction between idler and non-idler units on the time scale of the\nexperiment. We demonstrate our results based on stochastic and deterministic\nmodels, in particular the well known superposition of Lorentzians approach, the\nblinking quantum dot model, and deterministic dynamics generated by non-linear\nmapping. Our results show that the $1/f^\\alpha$ spectrum is inherently\nnonstationary even if the macroscopic measurement completely obscures the\nunderlying time dependence of the phenomena.\n", "  We investigate the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) in an open quantum XXZ\nchain with strong $XY$ plane boundary polarization gradient. Using the general\ntheory developed in [1], we show that in the critical $XXZ$ $|\\Delta|<1$ easy\nplane case, the steady current in large systems under strong driving shows\nresonance-like behaviour, by an infinitesimal change of the spin chain\nanisotropy or other parameters. Alternatively, by fine tuning the system\nparameters and varying the boundary dissipation strength, we observe a change\nof the NESS current from diffusive (of order $1/N$, for small dissipation\nstrength) to ballistic regime (of order 1, for large dissipation strength).\nThis drastic change results from an accompanying structural change of the NESS,\nwhich becomes a pure spin-helix state characterized by a winding number which\nis proportional to the system size. We calculate the critical dissipation\nstrength needed to observe this surprising effect.\n", "  We calculate the plasmon dispersion relation for Coulomb coupled metallic\narmchair graphene nanoribbons and doped monolayer graphene. The crossing of the\nplasmon curves, which occurs for uncoupled 1D and 2D systems, is split by the\ninterlayer Coulomb coupling into a lower and an upper plasmon branch. The upper\nbranch exhibits a highly unusual behavior with endpoints at finite $q$.\nAccordingly, the structure factor shows either a single or a double peak\nbehavior, depending on the plasmon wavelength. The new plasmon structure is\nrelevant to recent experiments, its properties can be controlled by varying the\nsystem parameters, and be used in plasmonic applications.\n", "  We present a halo-independent determination of the unmodulated signal\ncorresponding to the DAMA modulation if interpreted as due to dark matter\nweakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). First we show how a modulated\nsignal gives information on the WIMP velocity distribution function in the\nGalactic rest frame, from which the unmodulated signal descends. Then we\nperform a mathematically-sound profile likelihood analysis in which we profile\nthe likelihood over a continuum of nuisance parameters (namely, the WIMP\nvelocity distribution). As a first application of the method, which is very\ngeneral and valid for any class of velocity distributions, we restrict the\nanalysis to velocity distributions that are isotropic in the Galactic frame. In\nthis way we obtain halo-independent maximum-likelihood estimates and confidence\nintervals for the DAMA unmodulated signal. We find that the estimated\nunmodulated signal is in line with expectations for a WIMP-induced modulation\nand is compatible with the DAMA background+signal rate. Specifically, for the\nisotropic case we find that the modulated amplitude ranges between a few\npercent and about 25% of the unmodulated amplitude, depending on the WIMP mass.\n", "  We present a simple and fast method to simulate spin-torque driven\nmagnetisation dynamics in nano-pillar spin-valve structures. The approach is\nbased on the coupling between a spin transport code based on random matrix\ntheory and a micromagnetics finite-elements software. In this way the spatial\ndependence of both spin transport and magnetisation dynamics is properly taken\ninto account. Our results are compared with experiments. The excitation of the\nspin-wave modes, in- cluding the threshold current for steady state\nmagnetisation precession and the nonlinear frequency shift of the modes are\nreproduced correctly. The giant magneto resistance effect and the magnetisa-\ntion switching also agree with experiment. The similarities with recently\ndescribed spin-caloritronics devices are also discussed.\n", "  In the paper, the question whether truth values can be assigned to the\npropositions before their verification is discussed. To answer this question, a\nnotion of a propositionally noncontextual theory is introduced that in order to\nexplain the verification outcomes provides a map linking each element of a\ncomplete lattice identified with a proposition to a truth value. The paper\ndemonstrates that no model obeying such a theory and at the same time the\nprinciple of bivalence can be consistent with the occurrence of a non-vanishing\n\"two-path\" quantum interference term and the quantum collapse postulate.\n", "  Higgs boson compositeness is a phenomenologically viable scenario addressing\nthe hierarchy problem. In minimal models, the Higgs boson is the only degree of\nfreedom of the strong sector below the strong interaction scale. We present\nhere the simplest extension of such a framework with an additional composite\nspin-zero singlet. To this end, we adopt an effective field theory approach and\ndevelop a set of rules to estimate the size of the various operator\ncoefficients, relating them to the parameters of the strong sector and its\nstructural features. As a result, we obtain the patterns of new interactions\naffecting both the new singlet and the Higgs boson's physics. We identify the\ncharacteristics of the singlet field which cause its effects on Higgs physics\nto dominate over the ones inherited from the composite nature of the Higgs\nboson. Our effective field theory construction is supported by comparisons with\nexplicit UV models.\n", "  We propose a method for implementing automated state transformations on\nsingle-photon multipath qudits encoded in a one-dimensional transverse spatial\ndomain. It relies on transferring the encoding from this domain to the\northogonal one by applying a spatial phase modulation with diffraction\ngratings, merging all the initial propagation paths with a stable\ninterferometric network, and filtering out the unwanted diffraction orders. The\nautomated feature is attained by utilizing a programmable phase-only spatial\nlight modulator (SLM) where properly designed diffraction gratings displayed on\nits screen will implement the desired transformations, including, among others,\nprojections, permutations and random operations. We discuss the losses in the\nprocess which is, in general, inherently nonunitary. Some examples of\ntransformations are presented and, considering a realistic scenario, we analyse\nhow they will be affected by the pixelated structure of the SLM screen. The\nmethod proposed here enables one to implement much more general transformations\non multipath qudits than it is possible with an SLM alone operating in the\ndiagonal basis of which-path states. Therefore, it will extend the range of\napplicability for this encoding in high-dimensional quantum information and\ncomputing protocols as well as fundamental studies in quantum theory.\n", "  Besides the cuprate superconductors lead-doped barium bismuthate still\nattracts intense interest concerning its relatively high critical temperature\nand the nature of its superconductivity in vicinity to a charge density wave\nordered topological insulator. Here we present bilayers of barium bismuthate\nand barium leadate and find two-dimensional superconductivity at their\ninterfaces well described by current-voltage characteristics compatible with a\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Magneto-transport studies\nindependently prove the two-dimensional character of the superconducting\nproperties in these bilayers. The particular dependence of the superconducting\ntransition temperature on the thickness of the barium leadate top layer\nsuggests the formation of the superconducting state to be strain-induced\nthrough the interface.\n", "  We report on the slow magnetization dynamics observed upon the magnetic phase\ntransitions of GaV4S8, a multiferroic compound featuring a long-ranged\ncycloidal magnetic order and a N\\'eel-type skyrmion lattice in a relatively\nbroad temperature range below its Curie temperature. The fundamental difference\nbetween GaV4S8 and the chiral helimagnets, wherein the skyrmion phase was first\ndiscovered, lies within the polar symmetry of GaV4S8, promoting a cycloidal\ninstead of a helical magnetic order and rendering the magnetic phase diagram\nessentially different from that in the cubic helimagnets. Our ac magnetic\nsusceptibility study reveals slow relaxation dynamics at the field-driven phase\ntransitions between the cycloidal, skyrmion lattice and field-polarized states.\nAt each phase boundary, the characteristic relaxation times were found to\nexhibit a strong temperature dependence, starting from the minute range at low\ntemperatures, decreasing to the micro- to millisecond range at higher\ntemperatures.\n", "  Several recent experiments in atomic, molecular and optical systems motivated\na huge interest in the study of quantum long-range %spin systems. Our goal in\nthis paper is to present a general description of their critical behavior and\nphases, devising a treatment valid in $d$ dimensions, with an exponent\n$d+\\sigma$ for the power-law decay of the couplings in the presence of an\n$O(N)$ symmetry. By introducing a convenient ansatz for the effective action,\nwe determine the phase diagram for the $N$-component quantum rotor model with\nlong-range interactions, with $N=1$ corresponding to the Ising model. The phase\ndiagram in the $\\sigma-d$ plane shows a non trivial dependence on $\\sigma$. As\na consequence of the fact that the model is quantum, the correlation functions\nare anisotropic in the spatial and time coordinates for $\\sigma$ smaller than a\ncritical value and in this region the isotropy is not restored even at\ncriticality. Results for the correlation length exponent $\\nu$, the dynamical\ncritical exponent $z$ and a comparison with numerical findings for them are\npresented.\n", "  We investigate the nature of the superconducting state in curved\nnanostructures with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC). In bent nanostructures\nwith inhomogeneous curvature we find a local enhancement or suppression of the\nsuperconducting order parameter, with the effect that can be tailored by tuning\neither the RSOC strength or the carrier density. Apart from the local\nsuperconducting spin-singlet amplitude control, the geometric curvature\ngenerates non-trivial textures of the spin-triplet pairs through a spatial\nvariation of the d-vector. By employing the representative case of an\nelliptically deformed quantum ring, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the\nd-vector strongly depends on the strength of the local curvature and it\ngenerally exhibits a three-dimensional profile whose winding is tied to that of\nthe single electron spin in the normal state. Our findings unveil novel paths\nto manipulate the quantum structure of the superconducting state in RSOC\nnanostructures through their geometry.\n", "  We introduce a novel frequency-dependent incoherent pump scheme with a\nsquare-shaped spectrum as a way to study strongly correlated photons in arrays\nof coupled nonlinear resonators. This scheme can be implemented via a reservoir\nof population-inverted two-level emitters with a broad distribution of\ntransition frequencies. Our proposal is predicted to stabilize a\nnon-equilibrium steady state sharing important features with a zero-temperature\nequilibrium state with a tunable chemical potential. We confirm the efficiency\nof our proposal for the Bose-Hubbard model by computing numerically the steady\nstate for finite system sizes: first, we predict the occurrence of a sequence\nof incompressible Mott-Insulator-like states with arbitrary integer densities\npresenting strong robustness against tunneling and losses. Secondly, for\nstronger tunneling amplitudes or non-integer densities, the system enters a\ncoherent regime analogous to the superfluid state. In addition to an overall\nagreement with the zero-temperature equilibrium state, exotic non-equilibrium\nprocesses leading to a finite entropy generation are pointed out in specific\nregions of parameter space. The equilibrium ground state is shown to be\nrecovered by adding frequency-dependent losses. The promise of this improved\nscheme in view of quantum simulation of the zero temperature many-body physics\nis highlighted.\n", "  Geodesic bulk diagrams were recently shown to be the geometric objects which\ncompute global conformal blocks. We show that this duality continues to hold in\n$p$-adic AdS/CFT, where the bulk is replaced by the Bruhat-Tits tree, an\ninfinite regular graph with no cycles, and the boundary is described by\n$p$-adic numbers, rather than reals. We apply the duality to evaluate the\nfour-point function of scalar operators of generic dimensions using tree-level\nbulk diagrams. Relative to standard results from the literature, we find\nintriguing similarities as well as significant simplifications. Notably, all\nderivatives disappear in the conformal block decomposition of the four-point\nfunction. On the other hand, numerical coefficients in the four-point function\nas well as the structure constants take surprisingly universal forms,\napplicable to both the reals and the $p$-adics when expressed in terms of local\nzeta functions. Finally, we present a minimal bulk action with nearest neighbor\ninteractions on the Bruhat-Tits tree, which reproduces the two-, three-, and\nfour-point functions of a free boundary theory.\n", "  We present resistivity and magnetization measurements on proton-irradiated\ncrystals demonstrating that the superconducting state in the doped topological\nsuperconductor Nb$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (x = 0.25) is surprisingly robust against\ndisorder-induced electron scattering. The superconducting transition\ntemperature $T_c$ decreases without indication of saturation with increasing\ndefect concentration, and the corresponding scattering rates far surpass\nexpectations based on conventional theory. The low-temperature variation of the\nLondon penetration depth $\\Delta\\lambda(T)$ follows a power law\n($\\Delta\\lambda(T)\\sim T^2$) indicating the presence of symmetry-protected\npoint nodes. Our results are consistent with the proposed robust nematic $E_u$\npairing state in this material.\n", "  The Alice instrument on NASA's New Horizons spacecraft observed an\nultraviolet solar occultation by Pluto's atmosphere on 2015 July 14. The\ntransmission vs. altitude was sensitive to the presence of N2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4,\nC2H6, and haze. We derived line-of-sight abundances and local number densities\nfor the 5 molecular species, and line-of-sight optical depth and extinction\ncoefficients for the haze. We found the following major conclusions: 1) We\nconfirmed temperatures in Pluto's upper atmosphere that were colder than\nexpected before the New Horizons flyby, with upper atmospheric temperatures\nnear 65-68 K. The inferred enhanced Jeans escape rates were (3e22-7e22) N2/s\nand (4e25-8e25) CH4/s at the exobase (at a radius of ~2900 km, or an altitude\nof ~1710 km). 2) We measured CH4 abundances from 80 to 1200 km above the\nsurface. A joint analysis of the Alice CH4 and Alice and REX N2 measurements\nimplied a very stable lower atmosphere with a small eddy diffusion coefficient,\nmost likely between 550 and 4000 cm2/s. Such a small eddy diffusion coefficient\nplaced the homopause within 12 km of the surface, giving Pluto a small\nplanetary boundary layer. The inferred CH4 surface mixing ratio was\n~0.28-0.35%. 3) The abundance profiles of the C2Hx hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4,\nC2H6) were not simply exponential with altitude. We detected local maxima in\nline-of-sight abundance near 410 km altitude for C2H4, near 320 km for C2H2,\nand an inflection point or the suggestion of a local maximum at 260 km for\nC2H6. We also detected local minima near 200 km altitude for C2H4, near 170 km\nfor C2H2, and an inflection point or minimum near 170-200 km for C2H6. These\ncompared favorably with models for hydrocarbon production near 300-400 km and\nhaze condensation near 200 km, especially for C2H2 and C2H4 (Wong et al. 2017).\n4) We found haze that had an extinction coefficient approximately proportional\nto N2 density.\n", "  We demonstrate sensing of inhomogeneous dc magnetic fields by employing\nentangled trapped ions, which are shuttled in a segmented Paul trap. As\n\\textit{sensor states}, we use Bell states of the type\n$\\left|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\right>+\\text{e}^{\\text{i}\\varphi}\\left|\\downarrow\\uparrow\\right>$\nencoded in two $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions stored at different locations. Due to the\nlinear Zeeman effect, the relative phase $\\varphi$ serves to measure the\nmagnetic field difference between the constituent locations, while common-mode\nfluctuations are rejected. Consecutive measurements on sensor states encoded in\nthe $\\text{S}_{1/2}$ ground state and in the $\\text{D}_{5/2}$ metastable state\nare used to separate an ac Zeeman shift from the linear dc Zeeman effect. We\nmeasure magnetic field differences over distances of up to $6.2~\\text{mm}$,\nwith accuracies of around 300~fT, sensitivities down to $12~\\text{pT} /\n\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$, and spatial resolutions down to $10~\\text{nm}$. For\noptimizing the information gain while maintaining a high dynamic range, we\nimplement an algorithm for Bayesian frequency estimation.\n", "  Spin-coating technique is very fast, cheap, reproducible, simple and needs\nless material to fabricate films of particulate systems/colloids. Their\nthickness and uniformity may be controlled by means of external fields. We\napply magnetic fields during the spin-coating of a moderately concentrated\nsuperparamagnetic colloid (made of silica coated magnetite particles). We study\nthe influence of different magnetic field configurations (homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous) on the resulting spin-coated deposits and compare experimental\nresults under various conditions. Superparamagnetic colloids behave as,\nnon-Newtonian, magnetorheological fluids. Their viscosity vary significantly\nunder applied magnetic fields. We measure and compare the effect of uniform and\nnon-uniform magnetic fields on their relative effective viscosity, using the\nspin-coated deposits and a previously existing model for simple colloids. The\nmechanisms involved in the deposits formation under different experimental\nconditions are also discussed. In particular, we show that the magnetophoretic\neffect plays an important role in the spin-coating of magnetic colloids\nsubjected to non-uniform magnetic fields. We characterize an effective\nmagnetoviscosity in non-uniform magnetic fields that is largely influenced by\nthe magnetophoretic effect that enhances the flow of the magnetic fluid.\n", "  The dark matter issue is among the most perplexing in contemporary physics.\nThe problem is more enigmatic due to the wide range of possible solutions,\nranging from the ultra-light to the super-massive. String theory gives rise to\nplausible dark matter candidates due to the breaking of the non--Abelian Grand\nUnified Theory (GUT) symmetries by Wilson lines. The physical spectrum then\ncontains states that do not satisfy the quantisation conditions of the unbroken\nGUT symmetry. Given that the Standard Model states are identified with broken\nGUT representations, and provided that any ensuing symmetry breaking is induced\nby components of GUT states, leaves a remnant discrete symmetry that forbid the\ndecay of the Wilsonian states. A class of such states are obtained in a\nheterotic-string derived $Z^\\prime$ model. The model exploits the spinor-vector\nduality symmetry, observed in the fermionic $Z_2\\times Z_2$ heterotic-string\norbifolds, to generate a $Z^\\prime\\in E_6$ symmetry that may remain unbroken\ndown to low energies. The $E_6$ symmetry is broken at the string level with\ndiscrete Wilson lines. The Wilsonian dark matter candidates in the string\nderived model are $SO(10)$, and hence Standard Model, singlets and possess\nnon-$E_6$ $U(1)_{Z^\\prime}$ charges. Depending on the $U(1)_{Z^\\prime}$\nbreaking scale and the reheating temperature they give rise to different\nscenarios for the relic abundance, and in accordance with the cosmological\nconstraints.\n", "  We have studied the magnetotransport properties of a Sb$_2$Se$_2$Te single\ncrystal. Magnetoresistance (MR) is maximum when the magnetic field is\nperpendicular to the sample surface and reaches to a value of 1100\\% at $B$=31\nT with no sign of saturation. MR shows Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) oscillations\nabove $B$=15 T. The frequency spectrum of SdH oscillations consists of three\ndistinct peaks at $\\alpha$=32 T, $\\beta$=80 T and $\\gamma$=117 T indicating the\npresence of three Fermi surface pockets. Among these frequencies, $\\beta$ is\nthe prominent peak in the frequency spectrum of SdH oscillations measured at\ndifferent tilt angles of the sample with respect to the magnetic field. From\nthe angle dependence $\\beta$ and Berry phase calculations, we have confirmed\nthe trivial topology of the $\\beta$-pocket. The cyclotron masses of charge\ncarriers, obtained by using the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula, are found to be\n$m^{*}_{\\beta}=0.16m_o$ and $m^{*}_{\\gamma}=0.63m_o$ for the $\\beta$ and\n$\\gamma$ bands respectively. Large MR of Sb$_2$Se$_2$Te is suitable for\nutilization in electronic instruments such as a computer hard disc, high field\nmagnetic sensors, and memory devices.\n", "  We propose measurement based conditional generation of superposition of\nmotional states of nanomechanical resonator. We consider a two level quantum\nmechanical system coupled with nanomechanical resonator through phonon\nexchange. An interaction, which produces shifts in the state of nanomechanical\nresonator depending on the state of the qubit, is realized by driving qubit\nthrough two resonant lasers. The measurement of the state of quantum mechanical\nsystem produces superposition states of nanomechanical resonator. We show that\nthe quantum interference between states in superposition may lead to arbitrary\nlarge displacement in resonator. We also discuss decoherence of generated\nstates using Wigner function.\n", "  Twist fields emerge in a number of physical applications ranging from\nentanglement entropy to scattering amplitudes in four-dimensional gauge\ntheories. In this work, their vacuum expectation values are studied in the path\nintegral framework. By performing a gauge transformation, their correlation\nfunctions are reduced to field theory of matter fields in external\nAharonov-Bohm vortices. The resulting functional determinants are then analyzed\nwithin the zeta function regularization for the spectrum of Bessel zeros and\nconcise formulas are derived.\n", "  In this paper, the production process $e^- e^+ \\rightarrow A H$ is analyzed\nin the context of the type IV 2HDM and the question of observability of a\nneutral CP-even Higgs boson $H$ at a linear collider operating at $\\sqrt{s}=1$\nTeV is addressed. The CP-odd Higgs is assumed to experience a gauge-Higgs decay\nas $A\\rightarrow ZH$ with hadronic decay of $Z$ boson as the signature of\nsignal events. The production chain is thus $e^+e^- \\rightarrow AH \\rightarrow\nZHH \\rightarrow jj\\ell\\ell\\ell\\ell$ where $\\ell$ is a $\\tau$ or $\\mu$. Four\nbenchmark points with different mass hypotheses are assumed for the analysis.\nThe Higgs mass $m_H$ is assumed to vary within the range 150-300 GeV in\nincrements of 50 GeV. The anti-$k_t$ algorithm is used to perform the jet\nreconstruction. Results indicate that the neutral CP-even Higgs $H$ is\nobservable through this production mechanism using the di-muon invariant mass\ndistribution with possibility of mass measurement. The corresponding signal\nsignificances exceed $5\\sigma$ at integrated luminosity of 3000 $fb^{-1}$.\n", "  We consider a classical problem of control of an inverted pendulum by means\nof a horizontal motion of its pivot point. We suppose that the control law can\nbe non-autonomous and non-periodic w.r.t. the position of the pendulum. It is\nshown that global stabilization of the vertical upward position of the pendulum\ncannot be obtained for any Lipschitz control law, provided some natural\nassumptions. Moreover, we show that there always exists a solution separated\nfrom the vertical position and along which the pendulum never becomes\nhorizontal. Hence, we also prove that global stabilization cannot be obtained\nin the system where the pendulum can impact the horizontal plane (for any\nmechanical model of impact). Similar results are presented for several\nanalogous systems: a pendulum on a cart, a spherical pendulum, and a pendulum\nwith an additional torque control.\n", "  We performed a rate equation analysis on the dynamics of exciton Mott\ntransition (EMT) with assuming a detailed balance between excitons and unbound\nelectron-hole (e-h) pairs. Based on the Saha equation with taking into account\nthe empirical expression for the band-gap renormalization effect caused by the\nunbound e-h pairs, we show that the ionization ratio of excitons exhibits a\nbistability as a function of total e-h pair density at low temperatures. We\ndemonstrate that an incubation time emerges in the dynamics of EMT from\noversaturated exciton gas phase on the verge of the bistable region. The\nincubation time shows a slowing down behavior when the pair density approaches\ntoward the saddle-node bifurcation of the hysteresis curve of the exciton\nionization ratio.\n", "  We realise a phase-sensitive closed-loop control scheme to engineer the\nfluctuations of the pump field which drives an optomechanical system, and show\nthat the corresponding cooling dynamics can be significantly improved. In\nparticular, operating in the counter-intuitive \"anti-squashing\" regime of\npositive feedback and increased field fluctuations, sideband cooling of a\nnanomechanical membrane within an optical cavity can be improved by 7.5~dB with\nrespect to the case without feedback. Close to the quantum regime of reduced\nthermal noise, such feedback-controlled light would allow going well below the\nquantum backaction cooling limit.\n", "  The high-precision cross-section data for the reaction $\\gamma p \\to\nK^{*+}\\Lambda$ reported by the CLAS Collaboration at the Thomas Jefferson\nNational Accelerator Facility have been analyzed based on an effective\nLagrangian approach in the tree-level approximation. Apart from the $t$-channel\n$K$, $\\kappa$, $K^*$ exchanges, the $s$-channel nucleon ($N$) exchange, the\n$u$-channel $\\Lambda$, $\\Sigma$, $\\Sigma^*(1385)$ exchanges, and the\ngeneralized contact term, the contributions from the near-threshold nucleon\nresonances in the $s$-channel are also taken into account in constructing the\nreaction amplitude. It is found that, to achieve a satisfactory description of\nthe differential cross section data, at least two nucleon resonances should be\nincluded. By including the $N(2060){5/2}^-$ resonance, which is responsible for\nthe shape of the angular distribution near the $K^*\\Lambda$ threshold, and one\nof the $N(2000){5/2}^+$, $N(2040){3/2}^+$, $N(2100){1/2}^+$, $N(2120){3/2}^-$\nand $N(2190){7/2}^-$ resonances, one can describe the cross-section data quite\nwell, with the fitted resonance masses and widths compatible with those\nadvocated by the Particle Data Group. The resulted predictions of the beam,\ntarget, and recoil asymmetries are found to be quite different from various\nfits, indicating the necessity of the spin observable data for $\\gamma p \\to\nK^{*+}\\Lambda$ to further pin down the resonance contents and associated\nparameters in this reaction.\n", "  The Efimov effect was first predicted for three particles interacting at an\n$s$-wave resonance in three dimensions. Subsequent study showed that the same\neffect can be realized by considering two-body and three-body interactions in\nmixed dimensions. In this work, we consider the three-body problem of two\nbosonic $A$ atoms interacting with another single $B$ atom in mixed dimensions:\nThe $A$ atoms are confined in a space of dimension $d_A$ and the $B$ atom in a\nspace of dimension $d_B$, and there is an interspecies $s$-wave interaction in\na $d_{\\rm int}$-co-dimensional space accessible to both species. We find that\nwhen the $s$-wave interaction is tuned on resonance, there emerge an infinite\nseries of universal three-body bound states for $\\{d_A,d_B,d_{\\rm\nint}\\}=\\{2,2,0\\}$ and $\\{2,3,1\\}$. Going beyond the Efimov paradigm, the\nbinding energies of these states follow the scaling\n$\\ln|E_n|\\sim-s(n\\pi-\\theta)^2/4$ with the scaling factor $s$ being unity for\nthe former case and $\\sqrt{m_B(2m_A+m_B)}/(m_A+m_B)$ for the latter. We discuss\nhow our mixed dimensional systems can be realized in current cold atom\nexperiment and how the effects of these universal three-body bound states can\nbe detected.\n", "  We present a Keldysh-based derivation of a formula, previously obtained by\nOguri using the Matsubara formalisum, for the linear conductance through a\ncentral, interacting region coupled to non-interacting fermionic leads. Our\nstarting point is the well-known Meir-Wingreen formula for the current, whose\nderivative w.r.t.\\ to the source-drain voltage yields the conductance. We\nperform this derivative analytically, by exploiting an exact flow equation from\nthe functional renormalization group, which expresses the flow w.r.t.\\ voltage\nof the self-energy in terms of the two-particle vertex. This yields a\nKeldysh-based formulation of Oguri's formula for the linear conductance, which\nfacilitates applying it in the context of approximation schemes formulated in\nthe Keldysh formalism. (Generalizing our approach to the non-linear conductance\nis straightforward, but not pursued here.) -- We illustrate our linear\nconductance formula within the context of a model that has previously been\nshown to capture the essential physics of a quantum point contact in the regime\nof the 0.7 anomaly. The model involves a tight-binding chain with a\none-dimensional potential barrier and onsite interactions, which we treat using\nsecond order perturbation theory. We show that numerical costs can be reduced\nsignificantly by using a non-uniform lattice spacing, chosen such that the\noccurence of artificial bound states close to the upper band edge is avoided.\n", "  The merger of colliding black holes (BHs) should lead to the production of\nringdown or quasinormal modes (QNMs), which may very well be sensitive to the\nstate of the interior. We put this idea to the test with a recent proposal that\nthe interior of a BH consists of a bound state of highly excited, long, closed,\ninteracting strings; figuratively, a collapsed polymer. We show that such BHs\ndo indeed have a distinct signature in their QNM spectrum: A new class of modes\nwhose frequencies are parametrically lower than the lowest-frequency mode of a\nclassical BH and whose damping times are parametrically longer. The reason for\nthe appearance of the new modes is that our model contains another scale, the\nstring length, which is parametrically larger than the Planck length. This\ndistinction between the collapsed-polymer model and general-relativistic BHs\ncould be made with gravitational-wave observations and offers a means for\npotentially measuring the strength of the coupling in string theory. For\nexample, GW150914 already allows us to probe the strength of the string\ncoupling near the regime which is predicted by the unification of the\ngravitational and gauge-theory couplings. We also derive bounds on the\namplitude of the collapsed-polymer QNMs that can be placed by current and\nfuture gravitational-wave observations.\n", "  We search for runaway former companions of the progenitors of nearby Galactic\ncore-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution\n(TGAS). We look for candidates for a sample of ten SNRs with distances less\nthan $2\\;\\mathrm{kpc}$, taking astrometry and $G$ magnitude from TGAS and $B,V$\nmagnitudes from the AAVSO Photometric All-Sky Survey (APASS). A simple method\nof tracking back stars and finding the closest point to the SNR centre is shown\nto have several failings when ranking candidates. In particular, it neglects\nour expectation that massive stars preferentially have massive companions. We\nevolve a grid of binary stars to exploit these covariances in the distribution\nof runaway star properties in colour - magnitude - ejection velocity space. We\nconstruct an analytic model which predicts the properties of a runaway star, in\nwhich the model parameters are the properties of the progenitor binary and the\nproperties of the SNR. Using nested sampling we calculate the Bayesian evidence\nfor each candidate to be the runaway and simultaneously constrain the\nproperties of that runaway and of the SNR itself. We identify four likely\nrunaway companions of the Cygnus Loop, HB 21, S147 and the Monoceros Loop. HD\n37424 has previously been suggested as the companion of S147, however the other\nthree stars are new candidates. The favoured companion of HB 21 is the Be star\nBD+50 3188 whose emission-line features could be explained by pre-supernova\nmass transfer from the primary. There is a small probability that the\n$2\\;\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ candidate runaway TYC 2688-1556-1 associated with the\nCygnus Loop is a hypervelocity star. If the Monoceros Loop is related to the\non-going star formation in the Mon OB2 association, the progenitor of the\nMonoceros Loop is required to be more massive than $40\\;\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$\nwhich is in tension with the posterior for HD 261393.\n", "  Here we obtain explicit formulae for bounds on the complex electrical\npolarizability at a given frequency of an inclusion with known volume that\nfollow directly from the quasistatic bounds of Bergman and Milton on the\neffective complex dielectric constant of a two-phase medium. We also describe\nhow analogous bounds on the orientationally averaged bulk and shear\npolarizabilities at a given frequency can be obtained from bounds on the\neffective complex bulk and shear moduli of a two-phase medium obtained by\nMilton, Gibiansky and Berryman, using the quasistatic variational principles of\nCherkaev and Gibiansky. We also show how the polarizability problem and the\nacoustic scattering problem can both be reformulated in an abstract setting as\n\"Y -problems\". In the acoustic scattering context, to avoid explicit\nintroduction of the Sommerfeld radiation condition, we introduce auxilliary\nfields at infinity and an appropriate \"constitutive law\" there, which forces\nthe Sommerfeld radiation condition to hold. As a consequence we obtain\nminimization variational principles for acoustic scattering that can be used to\nobtain bounds on the complex backwards scattering amplitude. Some explicit\nelementary bounds are given.\n", "  Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have recently emerged as\npromising bright single photon sources. In this letter we investigate in\ndetails their optical properties at cryogenic temperatures. In particular, we\nperform temperature resolved photoluminescence studies and measure photon\ncoherence times from the hBN emitters. The obtained value of 81(1) ps\ntranslates to a width of $\\sim$12 GHz which is higher than the Fourier\ntransform limited value of $\\sim$32 MHz. To account for the photodynamics of\nthe emitter, we perform ultrafast spectral diffusion measurements that\npartially account for the coherence times. Our results provide important\ninsight into the relaxation processes in quantum emitters in hBN which is\nmandatory to evaluate their applicability for quantum information processing.\n", "  We discuss recent papers very critical of our Group Sunspot Number Series\n(Svalgaard & Schatten [2016]). Unfortunately, we cannot support any of the\nconcerns they raise. We first show that almost always there is simple\nproportionality between the group counts by different observers and that taking\nthe small, occasional, non-linearities into account makes very little\ndifference. Among other examples: we verify that the RGO group count was\ndrifting the first twenty years of observations. We then show that our group\ncount matches the diurnal variation of the geomagnetic field with high\nfidelity, and that the heliospheric magnetic field derived from geomagnetic\ndata is consistent with our group number series. We evaluate the 'correction\nmatrix' approach [Usoskin et al. 2016] and show that it fails to reproduce the\nobservational data. We clarify the notion of daisy-chaining and point out that\nour group number series has no daisy-chaining for the period 1794-1996 and\ntherefore no accumulation of errors over that span. We compare with the cosmic\nray record for the last 400+ years and find good agreement. We note that the\nActive Day Fraction method (of Usoskin et al.) has the fundamental problem that\nat sunspot maximum, every day is an 'active day' so ADF is nearly always unity\nand thus does not carry information about the statistics of high solar\nactivity. This 'information shadow' occurs for even moderate group numbers and\nthus need to be extrapolated to higher activity. The ADF method also fails for\n'equivalent observers' who should register the same group counts, but do not.\nWe conclude that the criticism of Svalgaard & Schatten [2016] is invalid and\ndetrimental to progress in the important field of long-term variation of solar\nactivity.\n", "  TUS (Tracking Ultraviolet Set-up), the first orbital detector of extreme\nenergy cosmic rays (EECRs), those with energies above 50 EeV, was launched into\norbit on April 28, 2016, as a part of the Lomonosov satellite scientific\npayload. The main aim of the mission is to test a technique of registering\nfluorescent and Cherenkov radiation of extensive air showers generated by EECRs\nin the atmosphere with a space telescope. We present preliminary results of its\noperation in a mode dedicated to registering extensive air showers in the\nperiod from August 16, 2016, to November 4, 2016. No EECRs have been\nconclusively identified in the data yet, but the diversity of ultraviolet\nemission in the atmosphere was found to be unexpectedly rich. We discuss\ntypical examples of data obtained with TUS and their possible origin. The data\nis important for obtaining more accurate estimates of the nocturnal ultraviolet\nglow of the atmosphere, necessary for successful development of more advanced\norbital EECR detectors including those of the KLYPVE (K-EUSO) and JEM-EUSO\nmissions.\n", "  We study entanglement generated between a charge qubit and a bosonic bath due\nto their joint evolution which leads to pure dephasing of the qubit. We tune\nthe parameters of the interaction, so that the decoherence is quantitatively\nindependent of the number of bosonic modes taken into account and investigate,\nhow the entanglement generated depends on the size of the environment. A second\nparameter of interest is the mixedness of the initial state of the environment\nwhich is controlled by temperature. We show analytically that for a pure\ninitial state of the environment, entanglement does not depend on environment\nsize. For mixed initial states of the environment, the generated entanglement\ndecreases with the increase of environment size. This effect is stronger for\nlarger temperatures, when the environment is initially more mixed, but in the\nlimit of an infinitely large environment, no entanglement is created at any\nfinite temperature.\n", "  We propose a new thermal freeze-out mechanism for ultra-heavy dark matter.\nDark matter coannihilates with a lighter unstable species, leading to an\nannihilation rate that is exponentially enhanced relative to standard WIMPs.\nThis scenario destabilizes any potential dark matter candidate. In order to\nremain consistent with astrophysical observations, our proposal necessitates\nvery long-lived states, motivating striking phenomenology associated with the\nlate decays of ultra-heavy dark matter, potentially as massive as the scale of\ngrand unified theories, $M_\\text{GUT} \\sim 10^{16}$ GeV.\n", "  We consider pressure-driven flows in wide microchannels, and discuss how a\ntransverse shear, generated by misaligned superhydrophobic walls, impacts\ncross-sectional spreading of Brownian particles. We show that such a transverse\nshear can induce an advective superdiffusion, which strongly enhances\ndispersion of particles compared to a normal diffusion, and that maximal\ncross-sectional spreading corresponds to a crossover between its subballistic\nand superballistic regimes. This allows us to argue that an advective\nsuperdiffusion can be used for boosting dispersion of particles at smaller\nPeclet numbers compared to known concepts of passive microfluidic mixing. This\nimplies that our superdiffusion scenario allows one efficient mixing of much\nsmaller particles or using much thinner microchannels than methods, which are\ncurrently being exploited.\n", "  Laser interferometers with high circulating power and suspended optics, such\nas the LIGO gravitational wave detectors, experience an optomechanical coupling\neffect known as a parametric instability: the runaway excitation of a\nmechanical resonance in a mirror driven by the optical field. This can saturate\nthe interferometer sensing and control systems and limit the observation time\nof the detector. Current mitigation techniques at the LIGO sites are\nsuccessfully suppressing all observed parametric instabilities, and focus on\nthe behaviour of the instabilities in the Fabry-Perot arm cavities of the\ninterferometer, where the instabilities are first generated. In this paper we\nmodel the full dual-recycled Advanced LIGO design with inherent imperfections.\nWe find that the addition of the power- and signal-recycling cavities shapes\nthe interferometer response to mechanical modes, resulting in up to four times\nas many peaks. Changes to the accumulated phase or Gouy phase in the\nsignal-recycling cavity have a significant impact on the parametric gain, and\ntherefore which modes require suppression.\n", "  We propose and discuss `quantum spin lenses', where quantum states of\ndelocalized spin excitations in an atomic medium are `focused' in space in a\ncoherent quantum process down to (essentially) single atoms. These can be\nemployed to create controlled interactions in a quantum light-matter interface,\nwhere photonic qubits stored in an atomic ensemble are mapped to a quantum\nregister represented by single atoms. We propose Hamiltonians for quantum spin\nlenses as inhomogeneous spin models on lattices, which can be realized with\nRydberg atoms in 1D, 2D and 3D, and with strings of trapped ions. We discuss\nboth linear and non-linear quantum spin lenses: in a non-linear lens, repulsive\nspin-spin interactions lead to focusing dynamics conditional to the number of\nspin excitations. This allows the mapping of quantum superpositions of\ndelocalized spin excitations to superpositions of spatial spin patterns, which\ncan be addressed by light fields and manipulated. Finally, we propose\nmultifocal quantum spin lenses as a way to generate and distribute entanglement\nbetween distant atoms in an atomic lattice array.\n", "  We consider higher dimensional gravity in which the four dimensional\nspacetime and extra dimensions are not treated on an equal footing. The\nanisotropy is implemented in the ADM decomposition of higher dimensional metric\nby requiring the foliation preserving diffeomorphism invariance adapted to the\nextra dimensions, thus keeping the general covariance only for the four\ndimensional spacetime. The conformally invariant gravity can be constructed\nwith an extra (Weyl) scalar field and a real parameter $z$ which describes the\ndegree of anisotropy of conformal transformation between the spacetime and\nextra dimensional metrics. In the zero mode effective 4D action, it reduces to\nfour-dimensional scalar-tensor theory coupled with nonlinear sigma model\ndescribed by extra dimensional metrics. There are no restrictions on the value\nof $z$ at the classical level and possible applications to the cosmological\nconstant problem with a specific choice of $z$ is discussed.\n", "  We investigate the tunable quantum entanglement and the probabilities of\nexcitations in a system of three qubits in a non-stationary cavity due to the\ndynamical Lamb effect, caused by non-adiabatic fast change of the boundary\nconditions of the cavity. The transition amplitudes and the probabilities of\nexcitation of qubits due to the dynamical Lamb effect have been evaluated. The\nconditional concurrence and the conditional residual tangle for each fixed\namount of created photons are introduced and calculated as measures of the\npairwise or three-way dynamical quantum entanglement of the qubits. We also\ngive a prescription on how to increase the values of those quantities by\ncontrolling the frequency of the cavity photons. A physical realization of the\nsystem with three superconducting qubits, coupled to a coplanar waveguide\nentangled due to the non-adiabatic fast change of boundary conditions of the\ncavity is proposed.\n", "  We derive a connection between the fourth coefficient of the short-distance\nTaylor expansion of the one-body correlation function, and the local three-body\ncorrelation function of the Lieb-Liniger model of $\\delta$-interacting spinless\nbosons in one dimension. This connection, valid at arbitrary interaction\nstrength, involves the fourth moment of the density of quasi-momenta.\nGeneralizing recent conjectures, we propose approximate analytical expressions\nfor the fourth coefficient covering the whole range of repulsive interactions,\nvalidated by comparison with accurate numerics. In particular, we find that the\nfourth coefficient changes sign at interaction strength $\\gamma_c\\simeq 3.816$,\nwhile the first three coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the one-body\ncorrelation function retain the same sign throughout the whole range of\ninteraction strengths.\n", "  We study relic gravitational waves in the paradigm of quintessential\ninflation. In this framework, irrespective of the underlying model, inflation\nis followed by the kinetic regime. Thereafter, the field energy density remains\nsub-dominant before the onset of acceleration. We carry out model independent\nanalysis to obtain the temperature at the end of inflation and the estimate for\nupper bound on the Hubble parameter to circumvent the problem due to relic\ngravitational waves. In this process, we used Planck 2015 data to constrain the\ninflationary phase. We demonstrate that the required temperature can be\nproduced by the mechanism of instant preheating. The generic feature of the\nscenario includes the presence of kinetic regime after inflation which results\ninto blue spectrum of gravitational wave background at high frequencies. We\ndiscuss the prospects of detection of relic gravitational wave background in\nthe advanced LIGO and LISA space-born gravitational wave missions. Finally we\nconsider a concrete model to realize the paradigm of quintessential inflation\nand show that inflationary as well as post-inflationary evolution can\nsuccessfully be described by the inflaton potential, $V(\\phi) \\propto\nExp(-\\lambda \\phi^n/\\Mpl^n)(n>1)$, by suitably constraining the parameters of\nthe model.\n", "  We discuss single-diffractive production of dijets. The cross section is\ncalculated within the resolved pomeron picture, for the first time in the\n$k_t$-factorization approach, neglecting transverse momentum of the pomeron. We\nuse Kimber-Martin-Ryskin unintegrated parton (gluon, quark, antiquark)\ndistributions (UPDF) both in the proton as well as in the pomeron or subleading\nreggeon. The UPDFs are calculated based on conventional MMHT2014nlo PDFs in the\nproton and H1 collaboration diffractive PDFs used previously in the analysis of\ndiffractive structure function and dijets at HERA. For comparison we present\nresults of calculations performed within collinear-factorization approach. Our\nresults remaind those obtained in the NLO approach. The calculation is (must\nbe) supplemented by the so-called gap survival factor which may, in general,\ndepend on kinematical variables. We try to describe the existing data from\nTevatron and make detailed predictions for possible LHC measurements. Several\ndifferential distributions are calculated. The $\\overline{E}_T$,\n$\\overline{\\eta}$ and $x_{\\bar p}$ distributions are compared with the Tevatron\ndata. A reasonable agreement is obtained for the first two distributions. The\nlast one requires to introduce a gap survival factor which depends on\nkinematical variables. We discuss how the phenomenological dependence on one\nkinematical variable may influence dependence on other variables such as\n${\\overline E}_T$ and ${\\overline \\eta}$. Several distributions for the LHC are\nshown.\n", "  The mass splitting between the quarkonium spin-singlet state $h$ ($J^{PC} =\n1^{+-}$) and the spin average of the quarkonium spin-triplet states $\\chi$\n($J^{PC} = 0^{++}, 1^{++}, 2^{++}$) is seen to be astonishingly small, not only\nin the charmonium and bottomonium cases where the relevant masses have been\nmeasured, but in positronium as well. We find, both in nonrelativistic quark\nmodels and in NRQCD, that this hyperfine splitting is so small that it can be\nused as a test of the pure $Q\\bar Q$ content of the states. We discuss the $2P$\nstates of charmonium in the vicinity of $3.9$ GeV, where the putative exotics\n$X(3872)$ and $X(3915)$ have been seen and a new $\\chi_{c0}(2P)$ candidate has\nbeen observed at Belle.\n", "  We constrain proton structure fluctuations at small-$x$ by comparing with the\nHERA diffractive vector meson production data, and find that large geometric\nfluctuations in the proton wave function are needed. Hydrodynamical simulations\nof proton-nucleus collisions including the fluctuating proton structure are\nfound to be compatible with the momentum anisotropies measured at the LHC.\n", "  In the context of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), we study the fate of Thiemann\ncomplexifier in homogeneous and isotropic FRW cosmology. The complexifier is\nthe dilatation operator acting on the canonical phase space for gravity and\ngenerates the canonical transformations shifting the Barbero-Immirzi parameter.\nWe focus on the closed algebra consisting in the complexifier, the 3d volume\nand the Hamiltonian constraint, which we call the CVH algebra. In standard\ncosmology, for gravity coupled to a scalar field, the CVH algebra is identified\nas a su(1,1) Lie algebra, with the Hamiltonian as a null generator, the\ncomplexifier as a boost and the su(1,1) Casimir given by the matter density.\nThe loop gravity cosmology approach introduces a regularization length scale\n$\\lambda$ and regularizes the gravitational Hamiltonian in terms of SU(2)\nholonomies. We show that this regularization is compatible with the CVH\nalgebra, if we suitably regularize the complexifier and inverse volume factor.\nThe regularized complexifier generates a generalized version of the Barbero's\ncanonical transformation which reduces to the classical one when $\\lambda\n\\rightarrow 0$. This structure allows for the exact integration of the actions\nof the Hamiltonian constraints and the complexifier. This straightforwardly\nextends to the quantum level: the cosmological evolution is described in terms\nof SU(1,1) coherent states and the regularized complexifier generates unitary\ntransformations. The Barbero-Immirzi parameter is to be distinguished from the\nregularization scale $\\lambda$, it can be rescaled unitarily and the Immirzi\nambiguity ultimately disappears from the physical predictions of the theory.\nFinally, we show that the complexifier becomes the effective Hamiltonian when\ndeparametrizing the dynamics using the scalar field as a clock, thus\nunderlining the deep relation between cosmological evolution and scale\n", "  The reduced density matrix (RDM) is a fundamental contraction of the\nBose-Einstein condensate wave function, encapsulating its one-body properties.\nIt serves as a major analysis tool with which the condensed component of the\ndensity can be identified. Despite its cardinal importance, calculating the\nground-state RDM of trapped interacting bosons is challenging and has been\nfully achieved only for specific models or when the pairwise interaction is\nweak. In this paper we discuss a new approach to compute the RDM based on a\ndouble-walker diffusion Monte Carlo random walk coupled with a stochastic\npermanent calculation. We here describe the new method and study some of its\nstatistical convergence and properties applying it to some model systems.\n", "  We construct various types of degenerate multi-soliton and multi-breather\nsolutions for the sine-Gordon equation based on B\\\"{a}cklund transformations,\nDarboux-Crum transformations and Hirota's direct method. We compare the\ndifferent solution procedures and study the properties of the solutions. Many\nof them exhibit a compound like behaviour on a small timescale, but their\nindividual one-soliton constituents separate for large time. Exceptions are\ndegenerate cnoidal kink solutions that we construct via inverse scattering from\nshifted Lam\\'{e} potentials. These type of solutions have constant speed and do\nnot display any time-delay. We analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the\nsolutions and compute explicit analytic expressions for time-dependent\ndisplacements between the individual one-soliton constituents for any number of\ndegeneracies. When expressed in terms of the soliton speed and spectral\nparameter the expression found is of the same generic form as the one formerly\nfound for the Korteweg de-Vries equation.\n", "  A geometric description of the space of states of a finite-dimensional\nquantum system and of the Markovian evolution associated with the\nKossakowski-Lindblad operator is presented. This geometric setting is based on\ntwo composition laws on the space of observables defined by a pair of\ncontravariant tensor fields. The first one is a Poisson tensor field that\nencodes the commutator product and allows us to develop a Hamiltonian\nmechanics. The other tensor field is symmetric, encodes the Jordan product and\nprovides the variances and covariances of measures associated with the\nobservables. This tensorial formulation of quantum systems is able to describe,\nin a natural way, the Markovian dynamical evolution as a vector field on the\nspace of states. Therefore, it is possible to consider dynamical effects on\nnon-linear physical quantities, such as entropies, purity and concurrence. In\nparticular, in this work the tensorial formulation is used to consider the\ndynamical evolution of the symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors and to read off\nthe corresponding limits as giving rise to a contraction of the initial Jordan\nand Lie products.\n", "  A number of very different approaches to quantum gravity contain a common\nthread, a hint that spacetime at very short distances becomes effectively two\ndimensional. I review this evidence, starting with a discussion of the physical\nmeaning of \"dimension\" and concluding with some speculative ideas of what\ndimensional reduction might mean for physics.\n", "  Recent results have shown that a field non-minimally coupled to the\nelectromagnetic Lagrangian can induce a violation of the Einstein equivalence\nprinciple. { This kind of coupling is present in a very wide class of\ngravitation theories.} In a cosmological context, this would break the validity\nof the cosmic distance duality relation as well as cause a time variation of\nthe fine structure constant. Here, we improve constraints on this scenario by\nusing four different observables: the luminosity distance of type Ia\nsupernovae, the angular diameter distance of galaxy clusters, the gas mass\nfraction of galaxy clusters and the temperature of the cosmic microwave\nbackground at different redshifts. We consider four standard parametrizations\nadopted in the literature and show that, due to a high complementarity of the\ndata, the errors are shrunk between 20\\% and 40\\% depending on the\nparametrization. We also show that our constraints are weakly affected by the\ngeometry considered to describe the galaxy clusters. In short, no violation of\nthe Einstein equivalence principle is detected up to redshifts $\\sim$ 3.\n", "  Semileptonic transitions $\\overline{B} \\to D^{(n)} \\ell \\overline{\\nu}$,\nwhere $D^{(n)} (n \\not = 0)$ is a radially excited meson, have recently\nattracted much attention as a way to understand some puzzles between theory and\ndata. Following closely the formalism of Falk and Neubert for the elastic case,\nwe study the $1/m_Q$ corrections to the heavy quark limit, in which the\ninelastic Isgur-Wise function vanishes at zero recoil, $\\xi^{(n)}(1) = 0\\ (n\n\\not = 0)$. We find simple formulas that involve the derivative\n$\\xi^{(n)'}(1)$, and we propose a number of ways of isolating this quantity in\npractice. We formulate also a generalization to the inelastic case of Luke's\ntheorem. On the other hand, although some $1/m_Q$ HQET results are satisfied in\nthe Bakamjian-Thomas relativistic quark model, we emphasize the problems\nconcerning these corrections in this scheme.\n", "  The effect of micron-sized particles on a low-pressure capacitively-coupled\nrf discharge is studied both experimentally and using numerical simulations. In\nthe laboratory experiments, microparticle clouds occupying a considerable\nfraction of the discharge volume are supported against gravity with the help of\nthe thermophoretic force. The spatiotemporally resolved optical emission\nmeasurements are performed with different arrangements of microparticles. The\nnumerical simulations are carried out on the basis of a one-dimensional hybrid\n(fluid-kinetic) discharge model describing the interaction between plasma and\nmicroparticles in a self-consistent way. The study is focused on the role of\nmicroparticle arrangement in interpreting the spatiotemporal emission\nmeasurements. We show that it is not possible to reproduce simultaneously the\nobserved microparticle arrangement and emission pattern in the framework of the\nconsidered one-dimensional model. This disagreement is discussed and attributed\nto two-dimensional effects, e.g., radial diffusion of the plasma components.\n", "  The optomechanics can generate fantastic effects of optics due to appropriate\nmechanical control. Here we theoretically study effects of slow and fast lights\nin a single-sided optomechanical cavity with an external force. The\nforce-induced transparency of slow/fast light and the force-dependent\nconversion between the slow and fast lights are resulted from effects of the\nrotating-wave approximation (RWA) and the anti-RWA, which can be controlled by\nproperly modifying the effective cavity frequency due to the external force.\nThese force-induced phenomena can be applied to control of the light group\nvelocity and detection of the force variation, which are feasible using current\nlaboratory techniques.\n", "  We introduce a framework for simulating quantum measurements based on\nclassical processing of a set of accessible measurements. Well-known concepts\nsuch as joint measurability and projective simulability naturally emerge as\nparticular cases of our framework, but our study also leads to novel results\nand questions. First, a generalisation of joint measurability is derived, which\nyields a hierarchy for the incompatibility of sets of measurements. A similar\nhierarchy is defined based on the number of outcomes used to perform the\nsimulation of a given measurement. This general approach also allows us to\nidentify connections between different types of simulability and, in\nparticular, we characterise the qubit measurements that are\nprojective-simulable in terms of joint measurability. Finally, we discuss how\nour framework can be interpreted in the context of resource theories.\n", "  Scalar-tensor theories of gravity modify General Relativity by introducing a\nscalar field that couples non-minimally to the metric tensor, while satisfying\nthe weak-equivalence principle. These theories are interesting because they\nhave the potential to simultaneously suppress modifications to Einstein's\ntheory on Solar System scales, while introducing large deviations in the strong\nfield of neutron stars. Scalar-tensor theories can be classified through the\nchoice of conformal factor, a scalar that regulates the coupling between matter\nand the metric in the Einstein frame. The class defined by a Gaussian conformal\nfactor with negative exponent has been studied the most because it leads to\nspontaneous scalarization (i.e. the sudden activation of the scalar field in\nneutron stars), which consequently leads to large deviations from General\nRelativity in the strong field. This class, however, has recently been shown to\nbe in conflict with Solar System observations when accounting for the\ncosmological evolution of the scalar field. We study whether this remains the\ncase when the exponent of the conformal factor is positive, as well as in\nanother class of theories defined by a hyperbolic conformal factor. We find\nthat in both of these scalar-tensor theories, Solar System tests are passed\nonly in a very small subset of parameter space, for a large set of initial\nconditions compatible with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, while we find\nthat it is possible for neutron stars to scalarize, one must carefully select\nthe coupling parameter to do so, and even then, the scalar charge is typically\ntwo orders of magnitude smaller than in the negative exponent case. Our study\nsuggests that future work on scalar-tensor gravity, for example in the context\nof tests of General Relativity with gravitational waves from neutron star\nbinaries, should be carried out within the positive coupling parameter class.\n", "  We report on the experimental characterization of a novel nonlinear\nliquid-filled hollow-core photonic-crystal fiber for the generation of photon\npairs at telecommunication wavelength through spontaneous four-wave-mixing. We\nshow that the optimization procedure in view of this application links the\nchoice of the nonlinear liquid to the design parameters of the fiber, and we\ngive an example of such an optimization at telecom wavelengths. Combining the\nmodeling of the fiber and classical characterization techniques at these\nwavelengths, we identify, for the chosen fiber and liquid combination,\nspontaneous four-wave-mixing phase matching frequency ranges with no Raman\nscattering noise contamination. This is a first step toward obtaining a telecom\nband fibered photon-pair source with a high signal-to-noise ratio.\n", "  We construct effective supergravity theories from customized constrained\nsuperfields which provide a setup consistent both for the description of\ninflation and the subsequent reheating processes. These theories contain the\nminimum degrees of freedom in the bosonic sector required for single-field\ninflation.\n", "  We suggest a description of the beam asymmetry in $p \\bar p$ and $\\Lambda\n\\bar \\Lambda$ photoproduction off the proton $\\vec\\gamma + p \\to p \\bar p + p$\nand $\\vec\\gamma + p \\to \\Lambda \\bar\\Lambda + p$, takes into account the\ncontribution of the scalar mesons $f_0(1370)$, $f_0(1500)$, and $f_0(1710)$.\nThese scalars are considered as mixed states of a glueball and nonstrange and\nstrange quarkonia in the framework based on the use of effective hadronic\nLagrangians. Present results can be used to guide the possible search for this\nreaction by the GlueX Collaboration at JLab. Also, we did an estimate of\ncontribution of heavier scalar meson states $f_0(2020)$, $f_0(2100)$, and\n$f_0(2200)$.\n", "  We calculate the frequencies of collective modes of neutrons, protons and\nelectrons in the outer core of neutron stars. The neutrons and protons are\ntreated in a hydrodynamic approximation and the electrons are regarded as\ncollisionless. The coupling of the nucleons to the electrons leads to Landau\ndamping of the collective modes and to significant dispersion of the low-lying\nmodes. We investigate the sensitivity of the mode frequencies to the strength\nof entrainment between neutrons and protons, which is not well characterized.\nThe contribution of collective modes to the thermal conductivity is evaluated.\n", "  Context. Solar observatories are providing the world-wide community with a\nwealth of data, covering large time ranges, multiple viewpoints, and returning\nlarge amounts of data. In particular, the large volume of SDO data presents\nchallenges: it is available only from a few repositories, and full-disk,\nfull-cadence data for reasonable durations of scientific interest are difficult\nto download practically due to their size and download data rates available to\nmost users. From a scientist's perspective this poses three problems:\naccessing, browsing and finding interesting data as efficiently as possible.\n  Aims. To address these challenges, we have developed JHelioviewer, a\nvisualisation tool for solar data based on the JPEG2000 compression standard\nand part of the open source ESA/NASA Helioviewer Project. Since the first\nrelease of JHelioviewer, the scientific functionality of the software has been\nextended significantly, and the objective of this paper is to highlight these\nimprovements.\n  Methods. The JPEG2000 standard offers useful new features that facilitate the\ndissemination and analysis of high-resolution image data and offers a solution\nto the challenge of efficiently browsing petabyte-scale image archives. The\nJHelioviewer software is open source, platform independent and extendable via a\nplug-in architecture.\n  Results. With JHelioviewer, users can visualise the Sun for any time period\nbetween September 1991 and today. They can perform basic image processing in\nreal time, track features on the Sun and interactively overlay magnetic field\nextrapolations. The software integrates solar event data and a time line\ndisplay. As a first step towards supporting science planning of the upcoming\nSolar Orbiter mission, JHelioviewer offers a virtual camera model that enables\nusers to set the vantage point to the location of a spacecraft or celestial\nbody at any given time.\n", "  We use the Holevo information to estimate distinguishability of microstates\nof a black hole in anti-de Sitter space by measurements one can perform on a\nsubregion of a Cauchy surface of the dual conformal field theory. We find that\nmicrostates are not distinguishable at all until the subregion reaches a\ncertain size and that perfect distinguishability can be achieved before the\nsubregion covers the entire Cauchy surface. We will compare our results with\nexpectations from the entanglement wedge reconstruction, tensor network models,\nand the bit threads interpretation of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.\n", "  We present a search for a neutrino signal from dark matter self-annihilations\nin the Milky Way using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (IceCube). In 1005 days\nof data we found no significant excess of neutrinos over the background of\nneutrinos produced in atmospheric air showers from cosmic ray interactions. We\nderive upper limits on the velocity averaged product of the dark matter\nself-annihilation cross section and the relative velocity of the dark matter\nparticles $\\langle\\sigma_{\\text{A}}v\\rangle$. Upper limits are set for dark\nmatter particle candidate masses ranging from 10 GeV up to 1 TeV while\nconsidering annihilation through multiple channels. This work sets the most\nstringent limit on a neutrino signal from dark matter with mass between 10 GeV\nand 100 GeV, with a limit of $1.18\\cdot10^{-23}\\text{cm}^3\\text{s}^{-1}$ for\n100 GeV dark matter particles self-annihilating via $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ to neutrinos\n(assuming the Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo profile).\n", "  In this paper we present conjoined constraints on several cosmological models\nfrom the expansion history $H(z)$ and cosmic growth $f\\sigma_8(z)$. The models\nwe study include the CPL $w_0w_a$ parametrization, the Holographic Dark Energy\n(HDE) model, the Time varying vacuum ($\\Lambda_t$CDM) model, the Dvali,\nGabadadze and Porrati (DGP) and Finsler-Randers (FRDE) models, a power law\n$f(T)$ model and finally the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model. In all cases we perform a\nsimultaneous fit to the SnIa, CMB, BAO, $H(z)$ and growth data, while also\nfollowing the conjoined visualization of $H(z)$ and $f\\sigma_8(z)$ as in Linder\n(2017). Furthermore, we introduce the Figure of Merit (FoM) in the\n$H(z)-f\\sigma_8(z)$ parameter space as a way to constrain models that jointly\nfit both probes well. We use both the latest $H(z)$ and $f\\sigma_8(z)$ data,\nbut also LSST-like mocks with $1\\%$ measurements and we find that the conjoined\nmethod of constraining the expansion history and cosmic growth simultaneously\nis able not only to place stringent constraints on these parameters but also to\nprovide an easy visual way to discriminate cosmological models. Finally, we\nconfirm the existence of a tension between the growth rate and Planck CMB data\nand we find that the FoM in the conjoined parameter space of\n$H(z)-f\\sigma_8(z)$ can be used to discriminate between the $\\Lambda$CDM model\nand certain classes of modified gravity models, namely the DGP and $f(T)$.\n", "  Suppose we measure the time-dependent spectrum of a single photon. That is,\nwe first send the photon through a set of frequency filters (which we assume to\nhave different filter frequencies but the same finite bandwidth $\\Gamma$), and\nthen record at what time (with some finite precision $\\Delta t$, and with some\nfinite efficiency $\\eta$) and after passing what filter the photon is detected.\nWhat is the POVM (Positive-Operator Valued Measure, the most general\ndescription of a quantum measurement) corresponding to such a measurement? We\nshow how to construct the POVM in various cases, with special interest in the\ncase $\\Gamma\\Delta t\\ll 1$ (time-frequency uncertainty still holds, even in\nthat limit). One application of the formalism is to heralding single photons.\nWe also find a Hong-Ou-Mandel type of interference effect with two photons\nentering a frequency filter.\n", "  For the spin Hall effect arising from strong band-structure spin-orbit\ncoupling, a semiclassical Boltzmann theory reasonably addressing the intriguing\ndisorder effect called side-jump is still absent. In this paper we describe\nsuch a theory of which the key ingredient is the spin-current-counterpart of\nthe semiclassical side-jump velocity (introduced in the context of the\nanomalous Hall effect). Applying this theory to spin Hall effects in a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas with giant Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we find\nlargely enhanced spin Hall angle in the presence of magnetic impurities when\nonly the lower Rashba band is partially occupied.\n", "  An incommensurate phase refers to a solid state in which the period of a\nsuperstructure is incommensurable with the primitive unit cell. Recently the\nincommensurate phase is induced by applying an in-plane strain to hexagonal\nmanganites, which demonstrates single chiral modulation of six domain variants.\nHere we employ Landau theory in combination with the phase-field method to\ninvestigate the incommensurate phase in hexagonal manganites. It is shown that\nthe equilibrium wave length of the incommensurate phase is determined by\ntemperature and the magnitude of the applied strain, and a temperature-strain\nphase diagram is constructed for the stability of the incommensurate phase.\nTemporal evolution of domain structures reveals that the applied strain not\nonly produces the force pulling the vortices and anti-vortices in opposite\ndirections, but also results in the creation and annihilation of\nvortex-antivortex pairs.\n", "  The dissociation of CO2 molecules in plasmas is a subject of enormous\nimportance for fundamental studies and the recent interest in carbon capture\nand carbon-neutral fuels. The vibrational excitation of the CO2 molecule plays\nan important role in the process. The complexity of the present state-to-state\n(STS) models makes it difficult to find out the key parameters. In this paper\nwe propose as an alternative a numerical method based on the diffusion\nformalism developed in the past for analytical studies. The non-linear\nFokker-Planck equation is solved by the time-dependent diffusion Monte Carlo\nmethod. Transport quantities are calculated from STS rate coefficients. The\nasymmetric stretching mode of CO2 is used as a test case. We show that the\nmethod reproduces the STS results or a Treanor distribution depending on the\nchoice of the boundary conditions. A positive drift, whose energy onset is\ndetermined by the vibrational to translational temperature ratio, brings\nmolecules from mid-energy range to dissociation. The high-energy fall of the\ndistribution is observed even neglecting VT processes which are normally\nbelieved to be its cause. Our study explains several puzzling features of\nprevious studies, provides new insights into the control of the dissociation\nrate and a much sought compression of the required data for modeling.\n", "  Simplicial complexes are now a popular alternative to networks when it comes\nto describing the structure of complex systems, primarily because they encode\nmulti-node interactions explicitly. With this new description comes the need\nfor principled null models that allow for easy comparison with empirical data.\nWe propose a natural candidate, the simplicial configuration model. The core of\nour contribution is an efficient and uniform Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler\nfor this model. We demonstrate its usefulness in a short case study by\ninvestigating the topology of three real systems and their randomized\ncounterparts (using their Betti numbers). For two out of three systems, the\nmodel allows us to reject the hypothesis that there is no organization beyond\nthe local scale.\n", "  We report on the results of a de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) measurement performed\non the recently discovered antiferromagnet URhIn$_5$ ($T_N$ = 98 K), a\n5\\textit{f}-analogue of the well studied heavy fermion antiferromagnet\nCeRhIn$_5$. The Fermi surface is found to consist of four surfaces: a roughly\nspherical pocket $\\beta$, with $F_\\beta \\simeq 0.3$ kT; a pillow-shaped closed\nsurface, $\\alpha$, with $F_\\alpha \\simeq 1.1$ kT; and two higher frequencies\n$\\gamma_1$ with $F_{\\gamma_1} \\simeq 3.2$ kT and $\\gamma_2$ with $F_{\\gamma_2}\n\\simeq 3.5$ kT that are seen only near the \\textit{c}-axis, and that may arise\non cylindrical Fermi surfaces. The measured cyclotron masses range from 1.9\n$m_e$ to 4.3 $m_e$. A simple LDA+SO calculation performed for the paramagnetic\nground state shows a very different Fermi surface topology, demonstrating a\nneed for more advanced electronic structure calculations.\n", "  We present results from moist convection in a mixture of pressurized sulfur\nhexa-flouride (liquid and vapor) and helium (gas) to model the wet and dry\ncomponents of the earth's atmosphere. To allow for homogeneous nucleation, we\noperate the experiment close to critical conditions. We report on the\nnucleation of microdroplets in the wake of large cold liquid drops falling\nthrough the supersaturated atmosphere and show that the homogeneous nucleation\nis caused by isobaric cooling of the saturated sulfur hexaflouride vapor. Our\nresults carry over to atmospheric clouds: falling hail and cold rain drops may\nenhance the heterogeneous nucleation of microdroplets in their wake under\nsupersaturated atmospheric conditions. We also observed that under appropriate\nconditions settling microdroplets form a rather stable horizontal cloud layer,\nwhich separates regions of super and sub critical saturation.\n", "  Recently we proposed [62] a fast computing scheme for generalized seniority\non spherical single-particle basis. This work redesigns the scheme to make it\napplicable to deformed single-particle basis. The algorithm is applied to the\nrare-earth nucleus $^{158}_{~64}$Gd$_{94}$ for intrinsic (body-fixed frame)\nneutron excitations under the low-momentum {\\emph{NN}} interaction\n$V_{{\\rm{low}}-k}$. By allowing as many as four broken pairs, we compute the\nlowest $300$ intrinsic states of several multipolarity. These states converge\nwell to the exact ones, showing generalized seniority is very effective in\ntruncating the deformed shell model. Under realistic interactions, the picture\nremains approximately valid that the ground state is a coherent pair\ncondensate, and the pairs gradually break up as excitation energy increases.\n", "  Recently significant progress has been made in $(2+1)$-dimensional conformal\nfield theories without supersymmetry. In particular, it was realized that\ndifferent Lagrangians may be related by hidden dualities, i.e., seemingly\ndifferent field theories may actually be identical in the infrared limit. Among\nall the proposed dualities, one has attracted particular interest in the field\nof strongly-correlated quantum-matter systems: the one relating the easy-plane\nnoncompact CP$^1$ model (NCCP$^1$) and noncompact quantum electrodynamics (QED)\nwith two flavors ($N = 2$) of massless two-component Dirac fermions. The\neasy-plane NCCP$^1$ model is the field theory of the putative deconfined\nquantum-critical point separating a planar (XY) antiferromagnet and a dimerized\n(valence-bond solid) ground state, while $N=2$ noncompact QED is the theory for\nthe transition between a bosonic symmetry-protected topological phase and a\ntrivial Mott insulator. In this work we present strong numerical support for\nthe proposed duality. We realize the $N=2$ noncompact QED at a critical point\nof an interacting fermion model on the bilayer honeycomb lattice and study it\nusing determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Using stochastic\nseries expansion QMC, we study a planar version of the $S=1/2$ $J$-$Q$ spin\nHamiltonian (a quantum XY-model with additional multi-spin couplings) and show\nthat it hosts a continuous transition between the XY magnet and the\nvalence-bond solid. The duality between the two systems, following from a\nmapping of their phase diagrams extending from their respective critical\npoints, is supported by the good agreement between the critical exponents\naccording to the proposed duality relationships.\n", "  Kinks and antikinks of the classical phi^4 field model are topological\nsolutions connecting its two distinct ground states.\n  Here we establish an analogy between the excitations of a long graphene\nnanoribbon buckled in the transverse direction and phi^4 model results. Using\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the dynamics of a buckled\ngraphene nanoribbon with a single kink and with a kink-antikink pair. Several\nfeatures of phi^4 model have been observed including the kink-antikink capture\nat low energies, kink-antikink reflection at high energies, and a bounce\nresonance. Our results pave the way towards the experimental observation of a\nrich variety of phi^4 model predictions based on graphene.\n", "  (BEDT-TFF)$_2$I$_3$ charge transfer salts are reported to show\nsuperconductivity and pressure induced quasi two-dimensional Dirac cones at the\nFermi level. By performing state of the art ab initio calculations in the\nframework of density functional theory, we investigate the structural and\nelectronic properties of the three structural phases $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ and\n$\\kappa$. \\edit{We furthermore report about the irreducible representations of\nthe corresponding electronic band structures, symmetry of their crystal\nstructure, and discuss the origin of band crossings. Additionally, we discuss\nthe chemically induced strain in $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ achieved by\nreplacing the Iodine layer with other Halogens: Fluorine, Bromine and Chlorine.\nIn the case of $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$F$_3$, we identify topologically\nprotected crossings within the band structure. These crossings are forced to\noccur due to the non-symmorphic nature of the crystal.} The calculated\nelectronic structures presented here are added to the organic materials\ndatabase (OMDB).\n", "  The correlation properties of the magnitudes of a time series (sometimes\ncalled volatility) are associated with nonlinear and multifractal properties\nand have been applied in a great variety of fields. Here, we have obtained\nanalytically the expression of the autocorrelation of the magnitude series of a\nlinear Gaussian noise as a function of its correlation as well as several\nanalytical relations involving them. For both, models and natural signals, the\ndeviation from these equations can be used as an index of non-linearity that\ncan be applied to relatively short records and that does not require the\npresence of scaling in the time series under study. We apply this approach to\nshow that the heart-beat records during rest show higher non-linearities than\nthe records of the same subject during moderate exercise. This behavior is also\nachieved on average for the analyzed set of 10 semiprofessional soccer players.\nThis result agrees with the fact that other measures of complexity are\ndramatically reduced during exercise and can shed light on its relationship\nwith the withdrawal of parasympathetic tone and/or the activation of\nsympathetic activity during physical activity.\n", "  Suppressing naturalness concerns, we discuss the compatibility requirements\nof high-scale supersymmetry breaking with the Higgs boson mass constraint and\ngauge coupling unification. We find that to accommodate superpartner masses\nsignificantly greater than the electroweak scale, one must introduce large\nnon-degeneracy factors. These factors are enumerated, and implications for the\nallowed forms of supersymmetry breaking are discussed. We find that\nsuperpartner masses of arbitrarily high values are allowed for suitable values\nof $\\tan\\beta$ and the non-degeneracy factors. We also compute the large, but\nviable, threshold corrections that would be necessary at the unification scale\nfor exact gauge coupling unification. Whether or not high-scale supersymmetry\ncan be realised in this context is highly sensitive to the precise value of the\ntop quark Yukawa coupling, highlighting the importance of future improvements\nin the top quark mass measurement.\n", "  We propose a new scheme for constructing an effective-field-theory-based\ninteraction to be used in the energy-density-functional (EDF) theory with\nspecific assumptions for defining a power counting. This procedure is developed\nthrough the evaluation of the equation of state (EOS) of symmetric and pure\nneutron matter going beyond the mean-field scheme and using a functional\ndefined up to next-to-leading order (NLO), that we will call NLO EDF. A\nSkyrme-like interaction is constructed based on the condition of\nrenormalizibility and on a power counting on $k_F/\\Lambda_{hi}$, where $k_F$ is\nthe Fermi momentum and $\\Lambda_{hi}$ is the breakdown scale of our expansion.\nTo absorb the divergences present in beyond mean-field diagrams, counter\ninteractions are introduced for the NLO EDF and determined through\nrenormalization conditions. In particular, three scenarios are explored and all\nof them lead to satisfactory results. These counter interactions contain also\nparameters which do not contribute to the EOS of matter and may eventually be\ndetermined through future adjustments to properties of some selected finite\nnuclei. Our work serves as a simple starting point for constructing a\nwell-defined power counting within the EDF framework.\n", "  Tidal disruption events (TDEs) by supermassive or intermediate mass black\nholes have been suggested as candidate sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays\n(UHECRs) and high-energy neutrinos. Motivated by the recent measurements from\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory, which indicates a metal-rich cosmic-ray\ncomposition at ultrahigh energies, we investigate the fate of UHECR nuclei\nloaded in TDE jets. First, we consider the production and survival of UHECR\nnuclei at internal shocks, external forward and reverse shocks, and\nnonrelativistic winds. Based on the observations of Swift J1644+57, we show\nthat the UHECRs can survive for external reverse and forward shocks, and disk\nwinds. On the other hand, UHECR nuclei are significantly disintegrated in\ninternal shocks, although they could survive for low-luminosity TDE jets.\nAssuming that UHECR nuclei can survive, we consider implications of different\ncomposition models of TDEs. We find that the tidal disruption of main sequence\nstars or carbon-oxygen white dwarfs does not successfully reproduce UHECR\nobservations, namely the observed composition or spectrum. The observed mean\ndepth of the shower maximum and its deviation could be explained by\noxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs, but they may be too rare to be the sources\nof UHECRs.\n", "  Circumstellar disks of gas and dust are naturally formed from contracting\npre-stellar molecular cores during the star formation process. To study various\ndynamical and chemical processes that take place in circumstellar disks prior\nto their dissipation and transition to debris disks, the appropriate numerical\nmodels capable of studying the long-term disk chemodynamical evolution are\nrequired. We present a new 2+1-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics model of\ncircumstellar disk evolution, in which the thin-disk model is complemented with\nthe procedure for calculating the vertical distributions of gas volume density\nand temperature in the disk. The reconstruction of the disk vertical structure\nis performed at every time step via the solution of the time-dependent\nradiative transfer equations coupled to the equation of the vertical\nhydrostatic equilibrium. We perform a detailed comparison between circumstellar\ndisks produced with our previous 2D model and with the improved 2+1D approach.\nThe structure and evolution of resulting disks, including the differences in\ntemperatures, densities, disk masses and protostellar accretion rates, are\ndiscussed in detail. The new 2+1D model yields systematically colder disks,\nwhile the in-falling parental clouds are warmer. Both effects act to increase\nthe strength of disk gravitational instability and, as a result, the number of\ngravitationally bound fragments that form in the disk via gravitational\nfragmentation as compared to the purely 2D thin-disk simulations with a\nsimplified thermal balance calculation.\n", "  Dynamics of a system in general depends on its initial state and how the\nsystem is driven, but in many-body systems the memory is usually averaged out\nduring evolution. Here, interacting quantum systems without external\nrelaxations are shown to retain long-time memory effects in steady states. To\nidentify memory effects, we first show quasi-steady state currents form in\nfinite, isolated Bose and Fermi Hubbard models driven by interaction imbalance\nand they become steady-state currents in the thermodynamic limit. By comparing\nthe steady state currents from different initial states or ramping rates of the\nimbalance, long-time memory effects can be quantified. While the memory effects\nof initial states are more ubiquitous, the memory effects of switching\nprotocols are mostly visible in interaction-induced transport in lattices. Our\nsimulations suggest the systems enter a regime governed by a generalized Fick's\nlaw and memory effects lead to initial-state dependent diffusion coefficients.\nWe also identify conditions for enhancing memory effects and discuss possible\nexperimental implications.\n", "  To realize a quantum network based on quantum entanglement swapping, bright\nand completely autonomous sources are essentially required. Here, we\nexperimentally demonstrate Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) quantum interference between\ntwo independent bright photon pairs generated via the spontaneous four-wave\nmixing in Doppler-broadened ladder-type 87Rb atoms. Bright autonomous heralded\nsingle photons are operated in a continuous-wave (CW) mode with no\nsynchronization or supplemental filters. The four-fold photon coincidence\ncounts per hour correspond to 5000 events for a temporal range of 10 ns, one\norder higher than those of previously reported for autonomous single photons.\nWe observe an HOM dip with 83% visibility with the two autonomous heralded\nsingle photons for an effective measurement time of 900 s. The achievement of\nthe HOM interference between the two bright autonomous photon-pair sources has\nmade an important step towards a practical scalable quantum network.\n", "  We have investigated the band structure at the $\\Gamma$ point of the\nthree-dimensional (3D) topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ using\nmagneto-spectroscopy over a wide range of energies ($0.55-2.2$\\,eV) and in\nultrahigh magnetic fields up to 150\\,T. At such high energies ($E>0.6$\\,eV) the\nparabolic approximation for the massive Dirac fermions breaks down and the\nLandau level dispersion becomes nonlinear. At even higher energies around 0.99\nand 1.6 eV, new additional strong absorptions are observed with a temperature\nand magnetic-field dependence which suggest that they originate from higher\nband gaps. Spin orbit splittings for the further lying conduction and valence\nbands are found to be 0.196 and 0.264 eV.\n", "  Aiming at studying the physical properties of Galactic IR bubbles and to\nexplore their impact in triggering massive star formation, we perform a\nmultiwavelength analysis of the bubble HII region Sh2-39 (N5) and its environs.\nTo analyze the molecular gas we use CO(3-2) and HCO+(4-3) line data obtained\nwith the ASTE telescope. To study the physical characteristics of the dust, we\nmake use of archival data from ATLASGAL, Herschel, and MSX, while the ionized\ngas was studied making use of NVSS data. We use public IR point source catalogs\nto search for candidate YSOs in the region. To investigate the stellar cluster\n[BDS2003]6 we use IR spectroscopic data obtained with the ARCoIRIS\nspectrograph, and new available IR Ks band observations from VVVX survey. The\nnew ASTE observations allowed the molecular gas component in the velocity range\nfrom 30 km/s to 46 km/s, associated with Sh2-39, to be studied in detail. We\nhave identified four molecular clumps, that were likely formed by the expansion\nof the ionization front, and determined some of their physical and dynamical\nproperties. Clumps having HCO+ and 870 micron counterparts show evidence of\ngravitational collapse. We identified several candidate YSOs across the\nmolecular component. Their spatial distribution, as well as the fragmentation\ntime derived for the collected layers of the molecular gas, suggest that\nmassive star formation might have been triggered by the expansion of the nebula\nvia the collect and collapse mechanism. The spectroscopical distance obtained\nfor the stellar cluster [BDS2003]6, placed over one of the collapsing clumps,\nreveals that this cluster is physically associated with the neabula and gives\nmore support to the triggered massive star formation scenario. A radio\ncontinuum data analysis indicates that the nebula is older and expands at lower\nvelocity than typical Galactic IR bubbles.\n", "  In recent work, Lelli et al. (2016) argue that the tightness of the baryonic\nTully-Fisher relation (BTFR) of the SPARC galaxy sample, and the weakness of\nthe correlation of its residuals with effective radius, pose challenges to LCDM\ncosmology. In this Letter we calculate the statistical significance of these\nresults in the framework of halo abundance matching, which imposes a canonical\ngalaxy-halo connection. Taking full account of sample variance among SPARC-like\nrealisations of the parent halo population, we find the scatter in the\npredicted BTFR to be 3.6 sigma too high, but the correlation of its residuals\nwith galaxy size to be naturally weak. Further, we find abundance matching to\ngenerate BTFR curvature in 3.0 sigma disagreement with the data, and a fraction\nof galaxies with non-flat rotation curves somewhat larger than observed.\n", "  The dynamics of a large array of coupled semiconductor lasers is studied for\na nonlocal coupling scheme. Our focus is on chimera states, a self-organized\nspatio-temporal pattern of co-existing coherence and incoherence. In laser\nsystems, such states have been previously found for global and nearest-neighbor\ncoupling, mainly in small networks. The technological advantage of large arrays\nhas motivated us to study a system of 200 nonlocally coupled lasers with\nrespect to the emerging collective dynamics. The crucial parameters are the\ncoupling strength, the coupling phase and the range of the nonlocal\ninteraction. We find that chimera states with multiple (in)coherent domains\nexist in a wide region of the parameter space. We provide quantitative\ncharacterization for the obtained chimeras and other spatio-temporal patterns.\n", "  We propose generalized magnetic mirrors that can be achieved by excitations\nof sole electric resonances. Conventional approaches to obtain magnetic mirrors\nrely heavily on exciting the fundamental magnetic dipoles, whereas here we\nreveal that besides magnetic resonances, electric resonances of higher orders\ncan be also employed to obtain highly efficient magnetic mirrors. Based on the\nelectromagnetic duality, it is also shown that electric mirrors can be achieved\nby exciting magnetic resonances. We provide direct demonstrations of the\ngeneralized mirrors proposed in a simple system of one-dimensional periodic\narray of all-dielectric wires, which may shed new light to many advanced fields\nof photonics related to resonant multipolar excitations and interferences.\n", "  The quasi-free $\\gamma d\\to\\pi^{-}p(p)$ differential cross section has been\nmeasured with CLAS at photon beam energies $E_\\gamma$ from 0.445 GeV to 2.510\nGeV (corresponding to $W$ from 1.311 GeV to 2.366 GeV) for pion center-of-mass\nangles $\\cos\\theta_\\pi^{c.m.}$ from -0.72 to 0.92. A correction for final state\ninteractions has been applied to this data to extract the $\\gamma n\\to\\pi^-p$\ndifferential cross sections. These cross sections are quoted in 8428\n$(E_\\gamma,\\cos\\theta_\\pi^{c.m.})$ bins, a factor of nearly three increase in\nthe world statistics for this channel in this kinematic range. These new data\nhelp to constrain coupled-channel analysis fits used to disentangle the\nspectrum of $N^*$ resonances and extract their properties. Selected photon\ndecay amplitudes $N^* \\to \\gamma n$ at the resonance poles are determined for\nthe first time and are reported here.\n", "  In this work we revisit the zero textures in low energy Majorana neutrino\nmass matrix when the active neutrino sector is extended by a light sterile\nneutrino in the eV scale i.e., the 3+1 scheme. In 3+1 scenario, the low energy\nneutrino mass matrix ($m_\\nu$) has ten independent elements. Thus in principle\none can have minimum one-zero texture to maximum ten-zero texture. We summarize\nthe previous results of one, two, three and four-zero textures which already\nexist in the literature and present our new results on five-zero textures. In\nour analysis we find that among six possible five-zero textures, only one is\nallowed by the present data. We discuss possible theoretical model which can\nexplain the origin of the allowed five-zero texture and discuss other possible\nimplications of such a scenario. Our results also concludes that in 3+1 scheme,\none can not have more than five-zeros in $m_\\nu$.\n", "  We study spin transfer torques induced by a spin-triplet supercurrent in a\nmagnet with the superconducting proximity effect. By a perturbative approach,\nwe show that spin-triplet correlations realize new types of torques, which are\nanalogous to the adiabatic and non-adiabatic ($\\beta$) torques, without\nextrinsic spin-flip scattering. Remarkable advantages compared to conventional\nspin-transfer torques are highlighted in domain wall manipulation. Oscillatory\nmotions of a domain wall do not occur for a small Gilbert damping, and the\nthreshold current density to drive its motion becomes zero in the absence of\nextrinsic pinning potentials due to the nonadiabatic torque controlled by the\ntriplet correlations.\n", "  We periodically kick a local region in a one-dimensional lattice and\ndemonstrate, by studying wave packet dynamics, that the strength and the time\nperiod of the kicking can be used as tuning parameters to control the\ntransmission probability across the region. Interestingly, we can tune the\ntransmission to zero which is otherwise impossible to do in a time-independent\nsystem. We adapt the non-equilibrium Green's function method to take into\naccount the effects of periodic driving; the results obtained by this method\nagree with those found by wave packet dynamics if the time period is small. We\ndiscover that Floquet bound states can exist in certain ranges of parameters;\nwhen the driving frequency is decreased, these states get delocalized and turn\ninto resonances by mixing with the Floquet bulk states. We extend these results\nto incorporate the effects of local interactions at the driven site, and we\nfind some interesting features in the transmission and the bound states.\n", "  The S=1/2 Heisenberg spin chain compound SrCuO2 doped with different amounts\nof nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), zinc (Zn) and cobalt (Co) has been studied by\nmeans of Cu nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Replacing only a few of the S=1/2\nCu ions with Ni, Pd, Zn or Co has a major impact on the magnetic properties of\nthe spin chain system. In the case of Ni, Pd and Zn an unusual line broadening\nin the low temperature NMR spectra reveals the existence of an impurity-induced\nlocal alternating magnetization (LAM), while exponentially decaying\nspin-lattice relaxation rates $T_1^{-1}$ towards low temperatures indicate the\nopening of spin gaps. A distribution of gap magnitudes is proven by a stretched\nspin-lattice relaxation and a variation of $T_1^{-1}$ within the broad\nresonance lines. These observations depend strongly on the impurity\nconcentration and therefore can be understood using the model of finite\nsegments of the spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, i.e. pure chain\nsegmentation due to S = 0 impurities. This is surprising for Ni as it was\npreviously assumed to be a magnetic impurity with S = 1 which is screened by\nthe neighboring copper spins. In order to confirm the S = 0 state of the Ni, we\nperformed x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and compared the measurements to\nsimulated XAS spectra based on multiplet ligand-field theory. Furthermore, Zn\ndoping leads to much smaller effects on both the NMR spectra and the\nspin-lattice relaxation rates, indicating that Zn avoids occupying Cu sites.\nFor magnetic Co impurities, $T_1^{-1}$ does not obey the gap like decrease, and\nthe low-temperature spectra get very broad. This could be related to the\nincrease of the Neel temperature which was observed by recent muSR and\nsusceptibility measurements, and is most likely an effect of the impurity spin\n$S\\neq0$.\n", "  Multi-layer graphene with rhombohedral stacking is a promising carbon phase\npossibly displaying correlated states like magnetism or superconductivity due\nto the occurrence of a flat surface band at the Fermi level. Recently, flakes\nof thickness up to 17 layers were tentatively attributed ABC sequences although\nthe Raman fingerprint of rhombohedral multilayer graphene is currently unknown\nand the 2D resonant Raman spectrum of Bernal graphite not understood. We\nprovide a first principles description of the 2D Raman peak in three and four\nlayers graphene (all stackings) as well as in Bernal, rhombohedral and an\nalternation of Bernal and rhombohedral graphite. We give practical\nprescriptions to identify long range sequences of ABC multi-layer graphene. Our\nwork is a prerequisite to experimental non-destructive identification and\nsynthesis of rhombohedral graphite.\n", "  Defining a new r-matrix compatible with the scalar product at the basis of\nthe Chern-Simons action for a particle coupled to (2+1) Lorentzian gravity with\ncosmological constant, I show how deformed symmetries of $\\kappa$-de Sitter\nand, in the vanishing cosmological limit, of $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e kind, arise\nnaturally as quantum-deformation of three dimensional gravity. I obtain\nmoreover the non-commutative spacetime associated to these kinds of symmetries.\n", "  Results of calculations for inelastic e+Mg effective collision strengths for\nthe lowest 25 physical states of Mg I (up to 3s6p 1P), and thus 300\ntransitions, from the convergent close-coupling (CCC) and the B-spline R-matrix\n(BSR) methods are presented. At temperatures of interest, ~5000 K, the results\nof the two calculations differ on average by only 4%, with a scatter of 27%. As\nthe methods are independent, this suggests that the calculations provide\ndatasets for e+Mg collisions accurate to this level. Comparison with the\ncommonly used dataset compiled by Mauas et al. (1988), covering 25 transitions\namong 12 states, suggests the Mauas et al. data are on average ~57% too low,\nand with a very large scatter of a factor of ~6.5. In particular the collision\nstrength for the transition corresponding to the Mg I intercombination line at\n457 nm is significantly underestimated by Mauas et al., which has consequences\nfor models that employ this dataset. In giant stars the new data leads to a\nstronger line compared to previous non-LTE calculations, and thus a reduction\nin the non-LTE abundance correction by ~0.1 dex (~25%). A non-LTE calculation\nin a supernova ejecta model shows this line becomes significantly stronger, by\na factor of around two, alleviating the discrepancy where the 457 nm line in\ntypical models with Mg/O ratios close to solar tended to be too weak compared\nto observations.\n", "  Semiconductor microcavities in the strong-coupling regime exhibit an energy\nscale in the THz frequency range, which is fixed by the Rabi splitting between\nthe upper and lower exciton-polariton states. While this range can be tuned by\nseveral orders of magnitude using different excitonic medium, the transition\nbetween both polaritonic states is dipole forbidden. In this work we show that\nin Cadmium Telluride microcavities, the Rabi-oscillation driven THz radiation\nis actually active without the need for any change in the microcavity design.\nThis feature results from the unique resonance condition which is achieved\nbetween the Rabi splitting and the phonon-polariton states, and leads to a\ngiant enhancement of the second order nonlinearity.\n", "  In this work, we investigate decays of $B_s\\to \\eta_c\\phi$ and $B_s\\to\n\\eta_cf_0(980)$ in a theoretical framework. The calculation is based on the\npostulation that $f_0(980)$ and $f_0(500)$ are mixtures of pure quark states\n${1\\over\\sqrt 2} (\\bar uu+\\bar dd)$ and $\\bar ss$. The hadronic matrix elements\nfor $B_s\\to \\phi$ and $B_s\\to f_0(980)$ are calculated in the light-front quark\nmodel and the important Wilson coefficient $a_2$ which is closely related to\nnon-perturbative QCD is extracted. However, our numerical results indicate that\nno matter how to adjust the mixing parameter to reconcile contributions of\n$f_0(980)$ and $f_0(500)$, one cannot make the theoretical prediction on\n$B_s\\to \\eta_c+\\pi^+\\pi^-$ to meet the data. Moreover, the new measurement of\n$BR(B_s\\to J/\\psi+f_0(500))<1.7\\times 10^{-6}$ also negates the mixture\nscenario. Thus, we conclude that the recent data suggest that $f_0(980)$ is a\nfour quark state ( tetraquark or $K\\bar K$ molecule ), at least the fraction of\nits pure quark constituents is small.\n", "  We make use of Friedrich's construction of the cylinder at spatial infinity\nto relate the logarithmic terms appearing in asymptotic expansions of\ncomponents of the Weyl tensor to the freely specifiable parts of time symmetric\ninitial data sets for the Einstein field equations. Our analysis is based on\nthe assumption that a particular type of formal expansions near the cylinder at\nspatial infinity corresponds to the leading terms of actual solutions to the\nEinstein field equations. In particular, we show that if the Bach tensor of the\ninitial conformal metric does not vanish at the point at infinity then the most\nsingular component of the Weyl tensor decays near null infinity as\n$O(\\tilde{r}^{-3}\\ln \\tilde{r})$ so that spacetime will not peel. We also\nprovide necessary conditions on the initial data which should lead to a peeling\nspacetime. Finally, we show how to construct global spacetimes which are\ncandidates for non-peeling polyhomogeneous) asymptotics.\n", "  General quadratic Hamiltonian models, describing interaction between crystal\nmolecules (typically with $D_{2h}$ symmetry) take into account couplings\nbetween their uniaxial and biaxial tensors. While the attractive contributions\narising from interactions between similar tensors of the participating\nmolecules provide for eventual condensation of the respective orders at\nsuitably low temperatures, the role of cross-coupling between unlike tensors is\nnot fully appreciated. Our recent study with an advanced Monte Carlo technique\n(entropic sampling) showed clearly the increasing relevance of this cross term\nin determining the phase diagram, contravening in some regions of model\nparameter space, the predictions of mean field theory and standard Monte Carlo\nsimulation results. In this context, we investigated the phase diagrams and the\nnature of the phases therein, on two trajectories in the parameter space: one\nis a line in the interior region of biaxial stability believed to be\nrepresentative of the real systems, and the second is the extensively\ninvestigated parabolic path resulting from the London dispersion approximation.\nIn both the cases, we find the destabilizing effect of increased cross-coupling\ninteractions, which invariably result in the formation of local biaxial\norganizations inhomogeneously distributed. This manifests as a small, but\nunmistakable, contribution of biaxial order in the uniaxial phase.The free\nenergy profiles computed in the present study as a function of the two dominant\norder parameters indicate complex landscapes, reflecting the difficulties in\nthe ready realization of the biaxial phase in the laboratory.\n", "  We consider the scalar perturbations of Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld\nbraneworld models in this paper. The dynamical equation for the physical\npropagating degree of freedom $\\xi(x^\\mu,y)$ is achieved by using the\nArnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition method: $F_1(y) {\\partial_y^2 \\xi} +\nF_2(y){\\partial_y \\xi } + {\\partial^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}}\\xi=0$. We conclude\nthat the solution is tachyonic-free and stable under scalar perturbations for\n$F_1(y)>0$ but unstable for $F_1(y)< 0$. The stability of a known analytic\ndomain wall solution with the warp factor given by $a(y)=\n\\text{sech}^{\\frac{3}{{4p}}}(ky)$ is analyzed and it is shown that only the\nsolution for $0<p<\\sqrt{8/3}$ is stable.\n", "  We consider N=2 four dimensional field theories compactified on a two torus\nin the presence of a U(1) magnetic field. We discuss the restrictions leading\nto theories with (2,2) supersymmetry or (0,2) supersymmetry in two dimensions.\nThe field theories live on D5 branes wrapped on four cycles of Calabi-Yau\n3-folds or 4-folds described as resolved ADE singularities or resolved conifold\nfibered over a two torus.\n", "  The origin and nature of extreme energy cosmic rays (EECRs), which have\nenergies above the 50 EeV, the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) energy limit, is\none of the most interesting and complicated problems in modern cosmic-ray\nphysics. Existing ground-based detectors have helped to obtain remarkable\nresults in studying cosmic rays before and after the GZK limit, but have also\nproduced some contradictions in our understanding of cosmic ray mass\ncomposition. Moreover, each of these detectors covers only a part of the\ncelestial sphere, which poses problems for studying the arrival directions of\nEECRs and identifying their sources. As a new generation of EECR space\ndetectors, TUS (Tracking Ultraviolet Set-up), KLYPVE and JEM-EUSO, are intended\nto study the most energetic cosmic-ray particles, providing larger, uniform\nexposures of the entire celestial sphere. The TUS detector, launched on board\nthe Lomonosov satellite on April 28, 2016, from Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia,\nis the first of these. It employs a single-mirror optical system and a\nphotomultiplier tube matrix as a photo-detector and will test the fluorescent\nmethod of measuring EECRs from space. Utilizing the Earth's atmosphere as a\nhuge calorimeter, it is expected to detect EECRs with energies above 100 EeV.\nIt will also be able to register slower atmospheric transient events:\natmospheric fluorescence in electrical discharges of various types including\nprecipitating electrons escaping the magnetosphere and from the radiation of\nmeteors passing through the atmosphere. We describe the design of the TUS\ndetector and present results of different ground-based tests and simulations.\n", "  Plasmonic resonances of nanoparticles have drawn lots of attentions due to\ntheir interesting and useful properties such as strong field enhancements.\nThese systems are typically studied using either classical electrodynamics or\nfully quantum theory. Each approach can handle some aspects of plasmonic\nsystems accurately and efficiently, while having its own limitation. The\nself-consistent hydrodynamics model has the advantage that it can incorporate\nthe quantum effect of the electron gas into classical electrodynamics in a\nconsistent way. We use the method to study the plasmonic response of polygonal\nparticles under the influence of an external electromagnetic wave, and we pay\nparticular attention to the size and shape of the particle and the effect of\ncharging. We find that the particles support edge modes, face modes and hybrid\nmodes. The charges induced by the external field in the edge (face) modes\nmainly localize at the edges (faces), while the induced charges in the hybrid\nmodes are distributed nearly evenly in both the edges and faces. The edge modes\nare less sensitive to particle size than the face modes, but are sensitive to\nthe corner angles of the edges. When the number of sides of regular polygons\nincreases, the edge and face modes gradually change into the classical dipole\nplasmonic mode of a cylinder. The hybrid modes are found to be the precursor of\nthe Bennett mode, which cannot be found in classical electrodynamics.\n", "  Anomalously large dielectric aging is found in the high-susceptibility\nplateau ferroelectric regime of ~95% deuterated potassium dihydrogen phosphate\n(DKDP). Much less aging is found in non-deuterated KDP. Optical images of the\nDKDP domain structure show no dramatic change during aging. Small changes in\nelectric field restore the pre-aged susceptibility, but the previous aging\nalmost recovers after returning to the aging field. Susceptibility vs. field\ncan show memory of at least two prior aging fields. Rectifying non-linear\nsusceptibility develops for fields slightly above or below a prior aging field.\nAging effects are not fully erased even by brief heating above the Curie point,\nindicating a role for diffusion of hydrogen to the domain walls, leaving\nchanges in disorder that can survive temporary absence of domain walls. Abrupt\nrandom-sign steps in polarization on cooling are accompanied by increases in\nsusceptibility, indicating competition between large-scale domain-wall\ninteraction effects and effects of local interactions with disorder.\n", "  The pair potential for helium has been computed with accuracy improved by an\norder of magnitude relative to the best previous determination. For the well\nregion, its uncertainties are now below 1 millikelvin. The main improvement is\ndue to the use of explicitly correlated wave functions at the nonrelativistic\nBorn-Oppenheimer (BO) level of theory. The diagonal BO and the relativistic\ncorrections were obtained from large full configuration interaction\ncalculations. The nonadiabatic perturbation theory was used to predict the\nproperties of the halo state of helium dimer. Its binding energy and the\naverage value of interatomic distance are found to be 138.9(5) neV and 47.13(8)\n{\\AA}. The binding energy agrees with its first experimental determination of\n151.9(13.3) neV [Zeller et al., PNAS 113, 14651 (2016)].\n", "  We study the half-chain entanglement entropy in the ground state of the\nspin-1/2 XX chain across an extended random defect, where the strength of\ndisorder decays with the distance from the interface algebraically as\n$\\Delta_l\\sim l^{-\\kappa}$. In the whole regime $\\kappa\\ge 0$, the average\nentanglement entropy is found to increase logarithmically with the system size\n$L$ as $S_L\\simeq\\frac{c_{\\rm eff}(\\kappa)}{6}\\ln L+const$, where the effective\ncentral charge $c_{\\rm eff}(\\kappa)$ depends on $\\kappa$. In the regime\n$\\kappa<1/2$, where the extended defect is a relevant perturbation, the\nstrong-disorder renormalization group method gives $c_{\\rm\neff}(\\kappa)=(1-2\\kappa)\\ln2$, while, in the regime $\\kappa\\ge 1/2$, where the\nextended defect is irrelevant in the bulk, numerical results indicate a\nnon-zero effective central charge, which increases with $\\kappa$. The variation\nof $c_{\\rm eff}(\\kappa)$ is thus found to be non-monotonic and discontinuous at\n$\\kappa=1/2$.\n", "  Given the possible repetitive nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs), their\ncosmological origin, and their high occurrence, detection of strongly lensed\nsources due to intervening galaxy lenses is possible with forthcoming radio\nsurveys. We show that if multiple images of a repeating source are resolved\nwith VLBI, using a method independent of lens modeling, accurate timing could\nreveal non-uniform motion, either physical or apparent, of the emission spot.\nThis can probe the physical nature of FRBs and their surrounding environments,\nconstraining scenarios including orbital motion around a stellar companion if\nFRBs require a compact star in a special system, and jet-medium interactions\nfor which the location of the emission spot may randomly vary. The high timing\nprecision possible for FRBs ($\\sim {\\rm ms}$) compared to the typical time\ndelays between images in galaxy lensing ($\\gtrsim 10\\, {\\rm days}$) enables the\nmeasurement of tiny fractional changes in the delays ($\\sim 10^{-9}$), and\nhence the detection of time-delay variations induced by relative motions\nbetween the source, the lens, and the Earth. We show that uniform cosmic\npeculiar velocities only cause the delay time to drift linearly, and that the\neffect from the Earth's orbital motion can be accurately subtracted, thus\nenabling a search for non-trivial source motion. For a timing accuracy of $\\sim\n1\\,$ms and a repetition rate (of detected bursts) $\\sim 0.05$ per day of a\nsingle FRB source, non-uniform displacement $\\gtrsim 0.1 - 1\\,$AU of the\nemission spot perpendicular to the line of sight is detectable if repetitions\nare seen over a period of hundreds of days.\n", "  We propose a scalable scheme for optical quantum computing using\nmeasurement-induced continuous-variable quantum gates in a loop-based\narchitecture. Here, time-bin-encoded quantum information in a single spatial\nmode is deterministically processed in a nested loop by an electrically\nprogrammable gate sequence. This architecture can process any input state and\nan arbitrary number of modes with almost minimum resources, and offers a\nuniversal gate set for both qubits and continuous variables. Furthermore,\nquantum computing can be performed fault-tolerantly by a known scheme for\nencoding a qubit in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space of a single light\nmode.\n", "  We demonstrate sharp thermally-induced switching between ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic RKKY exchange in a spin-valve with the spacer incorporating a\nthin diluted ferromagnetic layer as the core. We illustrate the mechanism\nbehind the effect as due to a change in the effective thickness of the spacer\ninduced by the Curie transition into its paramagnetic state.\n", "  The use of ultraviolet (UV) emission as a tracer of galaxy star-formation\nrate (SFR) is hampered by dust obscuration. The empirical relationship between\nUV slope, $\\beta$, and the ratio between far-infrared and UV luminosity, IRX,\nis commonly employed to account for obscured UV emission. We present a simple\nmodel that explores the physical origin of variations in the IRX - $\\beta$ dust\nattenuation relation. A relative increase in FUV attenuation compared to NUV\nattenuation and an increasing stellar population age cause variations towards\nred UV slopes for a fixed IRX. Dust geometry effects (turbulence, dust screen\nwith holes, mixing of stars within the dust screen, two-component dust model)\ncause variations towards blue UV slopes. Poor photometric sampling of the UV\nspectrum causes additional observational variations. We provide an analytic\napproximation for the IRX - $\\beta$ relation invoking a subset of the explored\nphysical processes (dust type, stellar population age, turbulence). We discuss\nobserved variations in the IRX - $\\beta$ relation for local (sub-galactic\nscales) and high-redshift (normal and dusty star-forming galaxies, galaxies\nduring the epoch of reionization) galaxies in the context of the physical\nprocesses explored in our model. High spatial resolution imaging of the UV and\nsub-mm emission of galaxies can constrain the IRX - $\\beta$ dust attenuation\nrelation for different galaxy types at different epochs, where different\nprocesses causing variations may dominate. These constraints will allow the use\nof the IRX - $\\beta$ relation to estimate intrinsic SFRs of galaxies, despite\nthe lack of a universal relation.\n", "  We study the problem of finding brane-like solutions to Lovelock gravity,\nadopting a general approach to establish conditions that a lower dimensional\nbase metric must satisfy in order that a solution to a given Lovelock theory\ncan be constructed in one higher dimension. We find that for Lovelock theories\nwith generic values of the coupling constants, the Lovelock tensors (higher\ncurvature generalizations of the Einstein tensor) of the base metric must all\nbe proportional to the metric. Hence, allowed base metrics form a subclass of\nEinstein metrics. This subclass includes so-called `universal metrics', which\nhave been previously investigated as solutions to quantum-corrected field\nequations. For specially tuned values of the Lovelock couplings, we find that\nthe Lovelock tensors of the base metric need to satisfy fewer constraints. For\nexample, for Lovelock theories with a unique vacuum there is only a single such\nconstraint, a case previously identified in the literature, and brane solutions\ncan be straightforwardly constructed.\n", "  Expanding media are typical in many different fields, e.g. in Biology and\nCosmology. In general, a medium expansion (contraction) brings about dramatic\nchanges in the behavior of diffusive transport properties. Here, we focus on\nsuch effects when the diffusion process is described by the Continuous Time\nRandom Walk (CTRW) model. For the case where the jump length and the waiting\ntime probability density functions (pdfs) are long-tailed, we derive a general\nbifractional diffusion equation which reduces to a normal diffusion equation in\nthe appropriate limit. We then study some particular cases of interest,\nincluding L\\'evy flights and subdiffusive CTRWs. In the former case, we find an\nanalytical exact solution for the Green's function (propagator). When the\nexpansion is sufficiently fast, the contribution of the diffusive transport\nbecomes irrelevant at long times and the propagator tends to a stationary\nprofile in the comoving reference frame. In contrast, for a contracting medium\na competition between the spreading effect of diffusion and the concentrating\neffect of contraction arises. For a subdiffusive CTRW in an exponentially\ncontracting medium, the latter effect prevails for sufficiently long times, and\nall the particles are eventually localized at a single point in physical space.\nThis \"Big Crunch\" effect stems from inefficient particle spreading due to\nsubdiffusion. We also derive a hierarchy of differential equations for the\nmoments of the transport process described by the subdiffusive CTRW model. In\nthe case of an exponential expansion, exact recurrence relations for the\nLaplace-transformed moments are obtained. Our results confirm the intuitive\nexpectation that the medium expansion hinders the mixing of diffusive particles\noccupying separate regions. In the case of L\\'evy flights, we quantify this\neffect by means of the so-called \"L\\'evy horizon\".\n", "  To fully exploit the potential of quasars as probes of cosmic chemical\nevolution and the internal gas dynamics of galaxies it is important to\nunderstand the selection effects behind the quasar samples and in particular if\nthe selection criteria exclude foreground galaxies with certain properties\n(most importantly a high dust content). Here we present spectroscopic follow-up\nfrom the 10.4-m GTC telescope of a dust-reddened quasar, eHAQ0111+0641, from\nthe extended High A_V Quasar (HAQ) survey. We find that the z=3.21 quasar has a\nforeground Damped Lyman-alpha Absorber (DLA) at z=2.027 along the line of\nsight. The DLA has very strong metal lines due to a moderately high metallicity\n(with an inferred lower limit of 25% of the solar metallicity), but a very\nlarge gas column density along the line-of-sight in its host galaxy. This\ndiscovery is further evidence that there is a dust bias affecting the census of\nmetals, caused by the combined effect of dust obscuration and reddening, in\nexisting samples of z>2 DLAs. The case of eHAQ0111+0641 illustrates that dust\nbias is not only caused by dust obscuration, but also dust reddening.\n", "  The spin-relaxation time for electrons in the impurity band of semiconductors\nwith wurtzite crystal structure is determined. The effective Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit interaction Hamiltonian is taken as the source of the spin\nrelaxation at low temperature and for doping densities corresponding to the\nmetallic side of the metal-insulator transition. The spin-flip hopping matrix\nelements between impurity states are calculated and used to set up a\ntight-binding Hamiltonian that incorporates the symmetries of wurtzite\nsemiconductors. The spin-relaxation time is obtained from a semiclassical model\nof spin diffusion, as well as from a microscopic self-consistent diagrammatic\ntheory of spin and charge diffusion in doped semiconductors. Estimates are\nprovided for particularly important materials. The theoretical spin-relaxation\ntimes compare favorably with the corresponding low-temperature measurements in\nGaN and ZnO. For InN and AlN, we predict that tuning of the spin-orbit coupling\nconstant induced by an external potential leads to a potentially dramatic\nincrease of the spin-relaxation time related to the mechanism under study.\n", "  The occurrence of bcc-fcc ($\\alpha$-$\\gamma$) and fcc-bcc ($\\gamma$-$\\delta$)\nphase transitions in magnetic iron stems from the interplay between magnetic\nexcitations and lattice vibrations. However, this fact has never been proven by\na direct dynamic simulation, treating non-collinear magnetic fluctuations and\ndynamics of atoms, and their coupling at a finite temperature. Starting from a\nlarge set of data generated by ab initio simulations, we derive non-collinear\nmagnetic many-body potentials for bcc and fcc iron describing fluctuations in\nthe vicinity of near perfect lattice positions. We then use spin-lattice\ndynamics simulations to evaluate the difference between free energies of bcc\nand fcc phases, assessing their relative stability within a unified dynamic\npicture. We find two intersections between the bcc and fcc free energy curves,\nwhich correspond to $\\alpha$-$\\gamma$ bcc-fcc and $\\gamma$-$\\delta$ fcc-bcc\nphase transitions. The maximum fcc-bcc free energy difference over the\ntemperature interval between the two phase transition points is 2 meV, in\nagreement with other experimental and theoretical estimates.\n", "  We experimentally investigate various quantum polarization features of\nthree-photon quantum states, including product and entangled states with\nvarying purity. The three-photon quantum states are categorized into six\nclasses based on the rotation symmetry of mean, variance, and skewness of the\npolarization distribution. The representative three-photon quantum states in\neach category is prepared from double-pair emission from pulsed spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion and quantum interferometry. We demonstrate that the\nthree-photon quantum states show interesting quantum polarization properties,\nsuch as, maximum sum-uncertainty and hidden polarizations.\n", "  We investigate the $\\phi$ meson nuclear transparency using some recent\ntheoretical developments on the $\\phi$ in medium self-energy. The inclusion of\ndirect resonant $\\phi N$-scattering and the kaon decay mechanisms leads to a\n$\\phi$ width much larger than in most previous theoretical approaches. The\nmodel has been confronted with photoproduction data from CLAS and LEPS and the\nrecent proton induced $\\phi$ production from COSY finding an overall good\nagreement. The results support the need of a quite large direct $\\phi\nN$-scattering contribution to the self-energy.\n", "  Wind-driving in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is commonly attributed to\na two-step process. First, matter in the stellar atmosphere is levitated by\nshock waves, induced by stellar pulsation, and second, this matter is\naccelerated by radiation pressure on dust, resulting in a wind. In dynamical\natmosphere and wind models the effects of the stellar pulsation are often\nsimulated by a simplistic prescription at the inner boundary. We test a sample\nof dynamical models for M-type AGB stars, for which we kept the stellar\nparameters fixed to values characteristic of a typical Mira variable but varied\nthe inner boundary condition. The aim was to evaluate the effect on the\nresulting atmosphere structure and wind properties. The results of the models\nare compared to observed mass-loss rates and wind velocities, photometry, and\nradial velocity curves, and to results from 1D radial pulsation models.\nDynamical atmosphere models are calculated, using the DARWIN code for different\ncombinations of photospheric velocities and luminosity variations. The inner\nboundary is changed by introducing an offset between maximum expansion of the\nstellar surface and the luminosity and/or by using an asymmetric shape for the\nluminosity variation. Models that resulted in realistic wind velocities and\nmass-loss rates, when compared to observations, also produced realistic\nphotometric variations. For the models to also reproduce the characteristic\nradial velocity curve present in Mira stars (derived from CO $\\Delta v = 3$\nlines), an overall phase shift of 0.2 between the maxima of the luminosity and\nradial variation had to be introduced. We find that a group of models with\ndifferent boundary conditions (29 models, including the model with standard\nboundary conditions) results in realistic velocities and mass-loss rates, and\nin photometric variations.\n", "  We explore the low energy phenomenology of an F-theory based SU(5) model\nwhich, in addition to the known quarks and leptons, contains Standard Model\nsinglets, and vector-like color triplets and SU(2) doublets. Depending on their\nmasses and couplings, some of these new particles may be observed at the LHC\nand future colliders. We discuss the restrictions by CKM constraints on their\nmixing with the ordinary down quarks of the three chiral familes. The model is\nconsistent with gauge coupling unification at the usual supersymmetric GUT\nscale, dimension five proton decay is adequately suppressed, while\ndimension-six decay mediated by the superheavy gauge bosons is enhanced by a\nfactor of 5-7. The third generation charged fermion Yukawa couplings yield the\ncorresponding low-energy masses in reasonable agreement with observations. The\nhierarchical nature of the masses of lighter generations is accounted for via\nnon-renormalisable interactions, with the perturbative vacuum expectation\nvalues of the SM singlet fields playing an essential role.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the Affleck-Dine field after inflation in more\ndetail. After inflation, the Affleck-Dine field inevitably oscillates around\nthe potential minimum. This oscillation is hard to decay and can cause\naccidental suppression of the consequential baryon asymmetry. This suppression\nis most effective for the model with non-renormalizable superpotential\n$W_{AD}\\sim \\Phi^4$ ($\\Phi$: Affleck-Dine field). It is found that the\nAffleck-Dine leptogenesis in high-scale inflation, which suffers from serious\ngravitino overproduction, becomes workable owing to this effect.\n", "  We analyze the electronic properties of the recently discovered\nstoichiometric superconductor CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ by combining an ab initio\napproach and a projection of the band structure to a lowenergy tight-binding\nHamiltonian, based on the maximally localized Wannier orbitals of the 3d Fe\nstates. We identify the key symmetries as well as differences and similarities\nin the electronic structure between CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ and the parent systems\nCaFe$_2$As$_2$ and KFe$_2$As$_2$. In particular, we find CaKFe4As4 to have a\nsignificantly more quasi-two-dimensional electronic structure than the latter\nsystems. Finally, we study the superconducting instabilities in CaKFe$_4$As$_4$\nby employing the leading angular harmonics approximation (LAHA) and find two\npotential A$_{1g}$-symmetry representation of the superconducting gap to be the\ndominant instabilities in this system.\n", "  The softness of elastic atomic collisions, defined as the average number of\ncollisions each atom undergoes until its energy decorrelates significantly, can\nhave a considerable effect on the decay dynamics of atomic coherence. In this\npaper we combine two spectroscopic methods to measure these dynamics and obtain\nthe collisional softness of ultra-cold atoms in an optical trap: Ramsey\nspectroscopy to measure the energy decorrelation rate and echo spectroscopy to\nmeasure the collision rate. We obtain a value of 2.5 (3) for the collisional\nsoftness, in good agreement with previously reported numerical molecular\ndynamics simulations. This fundamental quantity was used to determine the\n$s$-wave scattering lengths of different atoms but has not been directly\nmeasured. We further show that the decay dynamics of the revival amplitudes in\nthe echo experiment has a transition in its functional decay. The transition\ntime is related to the softness of the collisions and provides yet another way\nto approximate it. These conclusions are supported by Monte Carlo simulations\nof the full echo dynamics. The methods presented here can allow measurements of\na generalized softness parameter for other two-level quantum systems with\ndiscrete spectral fluctuations.\n", "  Here we apply the full Will-Nordtvedt version of the Parameterized\nPost-Newtonian (PPN) formalism to a class of General Relativity extensions that\nare based on nontrivial renormalization group (RG) effects at large scales. We\nfocus on a class of models in which the gravitational coupling constant $G$ is\ncorrelated with the Newtonian potential. A previous PPN analysis considered a\nspecific realization of the RG effects, and only within the\nEddington-Robertson-Schiff version of the PPN formalism, which is a less\ncomplete and robust PPN formulation. Here we find stronger, more precise\nbounds, and with less assumptions. We also consider the External Potential\nEffect (EPE), which is an effect that is intrinsic to this framework and\ndepends on the system environment (it has some qualitative similarities to the\nscreening mechanisms of modified gravity theories). We find a single particular\nRG realization that is not affected by the EPE. Some physical systems have been\npointed out as candidates for measuring the possible RG effects in gravity at\nlarge scales, for any of them the Solar System bounds need to be considered.\n", "  We report measurement of the valence-to-core (VTC) region of the K-shell\nx-ray emission spectra from several Zn and Fe inorganic compounds, and their\ncritical comparison with several existing theoretical treatments. We find\ngenerally good agreement between the respective theories and experiment, and in\nparticular find an important admixture of dipole and quadrupole character for\nZn materials that is much weaker in Fe-based systems. These results on\nmaterials whose simple crystal structures should not, a prior, pose deep\nchallenges to theory, will prove useful in guiding the further development of\nDFT and time-dependent DFT methods for VTC-XES predictions and their comparison\nto experiment.\n", "  We consider the simplest non-integrable model of multistate Landau-Zener\ntransition. In this model two pairs of levels in two tunnel coupled quantum\ndots are swept passed each other by the gate voltage. Although this 2 * 2 model\nis non-integrable, it can be solved analytically in the limit when the\ninter-level energy distance is much smaller than their tunnel splitting. The\nresult is contrasted to the similar 2 * 1 model, in which one of the dots\ncontains only one level. The latter model does not allow interference of the\nvirtual transition amplitudes, and it is exactly solvable. In 2 * 1 model, the\nprobability for a particle, residing at time t -> -\\infty in one dot, to remain\nin the same dot at t -> \\infty falls off exponentially with tunnel coupling. By\ncontrast, in 2 * 2 model, this probability grows exponentially with tunnel\ncoupling. The physical origin of this growth is the formation of the\ntunneling-induced collective states in the system of two dots. This can be\nviewed as manifestation of the Dicke effect.\n", "  Nonzero neutrino masses are required by the existence of flavour\noscillations, with values of the order of at least 50 meV. We consider the\ngravitational clustering of relic neutrinos within the Milky Way, and used the\n$N$-one-body simulation technique to compute their density enhancement factor\nin the neighbourhood of the Earth with respect to the average cosmic density.\nCompared to previous similar studies, we pushed the simulation down to smaller\nneutrino masses, and included an improved treatment of the baryonic and dark\nmatter distributions in the Milky Way. Our results are important for future\nexperiments aiming at detecting the cosmic neutrino background, such as the\nPrinceton Tritium Observatory for Light, Early-universe, Massive-neutrino Yield\n(PTOLEMY) proposal. We calculate the impact of neutrino clustering in the Milky\nWay on the expected event rate for a PTOLEMY-like experiment. We find that the\neffect of clustering remains negligible for the minimal normal hierarchy\nscenario, while it enhances the event rate by 10 to 20% (resp. a factor 1.7 to\n2.5) for the minimal inverted hierarchy scenario (resp. a degenerate scenario\nwith 150 meV masses). Finally we compute the impact on the event rate of a\npossible fourth sterile neutrino with a mass of 1.3 eV.\n", "  We have measured the doping and temperature dependence of lattice vibrations\nand magnetic excitations in the prototypical doped spin-orbit Mott insulator\nSr$_{2-x}$La$_x$IrO$_4$ (x=0, 0.015, and 0.10). Our findings show that the\npseudospin-lattice coupling -- responsible for the renormalization of several\nlow energy phonon modes -- is preserved even when long-range magnetic order is\nsuppressed by doping. In our most highly doped sample, the single magnon\n(Gamma-point) excitation disappears while the two-magnon mode softens and\nbecomes heavily damped. Doping induced electron-phonon coupling is also\nobserved in a higher energy phonon mode. We observe two different\nelectron-phonon interaction channels, which provide evidence of the coexistence\nof fluctuating magnetic moments and mobile carriers in doped iridates.\n", "  By considering a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ degenerate Fermi gases in a ring cavity\nwhere strong interaction between atoms and light gives rise to a superradiance,\nwe find the cavity dissipation could cause a severe broadening in some special\ncases, breaking down the quasi-particle picture which was constantly assumed in\nmean field theory studies. This broadening happens when the band gap resonant\nwith polariton excitation energy. Interestingly enough, this broadening is\nhighly spin selective depending on how the fermions are filled and the spectrum\nbecomes asymmetric due to dissipation. Further, a non-monotonous dependence of\nthe maximal broadening of the spectrum against cavity decay rate $\\kappa$ is\nfound and the largest broadening emerges at $\\kappa$ comparable to recoil\nenergy.\n", "  In polar insulators where longitudinal and transverse optical phonon modes\ndiffer substantially, the electron-phonon coupling affects the energy-band\nstructure primarily through the long-range Fr\\\"ohlich contribution to the Fan\nterm. This diagram has the same structure as the $GW$ self-energy where $W$\noriginates from the electron part of the screened coulomb interaction. The two\ncan be conveniently combined by combining electron and lattice contributions to\nthe polarizability. Both contributions are nonanalytic at the origin, and\ndiverge as $1/q^2$ so that the predominant contribution comes from a small\nregion around $q{=}0$. Here we adopt a simple estimate for the Fr\\\"ohlich\ncontribution by assuming that the entire phonon part can be attributed to a\nsmall volume of $q$ near $q{=}0$. We estimate the magnitude for\n$\\mathbf{q}{\\rightarrow}0$ from a generalized Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation,\nand the radius from the inverse of the polaron length scale. The gap correction\nis shown to agree with Fr\\\"ohlich's simple estimate $-\\alpha_P\\omega_L/2$ of\nthe polaron effect.\n", "  We have searched for the Cabibbo-suppressed decay $\\Lambda_c^+\\to\\phi p\\pi^0$\nin $e^+e^-$ collisions using a data sample corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 915 $\\rm fb^{-1}$. The data were collected by the Belle\nexperiment at the KEKB $e^+e^-$ asymmetric-energy collider running at or near\nthe $\\Upsilon(4S)$ and $\\Upsilon(5S)$ resonances. No significant signal is\nobserved, and we set an upper limit on the branching fraction of\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^+\\to \\phi p\\pi^0) <15.3\\times10^{-5}$ at 90% confidence\nlevel. The contribution for nonresonant $\\Lambda_c^+\\to K^+K^- p\\pi^0$ decays\nis found to be consistent with zero and the corresponding upper limit on its\nbranching fraction is set to be $\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^+\\to K^+K^-p\\pi^0)_{\\rm\nNR} <6.3\\times10^{-5} $ at 90% confidence level. We also measure the branching\nfraction for the Cabibbo-favored decay $\\Lambda_c^+\\to K^-\\pi^+p\\pi^0$; the\nresult is $\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^+\\to K^-\\pi^+p\\pi^0)= (4.42\\pm0.05\\, (\\rm\nstat.) \\pm 0.12\\, (\\rm syst.) \\pm 0.16\\, (\\mathcal{B}_{\\rm Norm}))\\%$, which is\nthe most precise measurement to date. Finally, we have searched for an\nintermediate hidden-strangeness pentaquark decay $P^+_s\\to\\phi p$. We see no\nevidence for this intermediate decay and set an upper limit on the product\nbranching fraction of ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_c^+\\to P^+_s \\pi^0)\\times {\\cal\nB}(P^+_s\\to\\phi p) <8.3\\times 10^{-5}$ at 90% confidence level.\n", "  The competition of interactions implies the compensation of standard\nmechanisms which leads to the emergence of exotic phases between conventional\nphases. The extended Hubbard model (EHM) is a fundamental example for the\ncompetition of the local Hubbard interaction and the nearest-neighbor\ndensity-density interaction, which at half-filling and in one dimension leads\nto a bond order wave (BOW) between a charge density wave (CDW) and a\nquasi-long-range order Mott insulator (MI). We study the full momentum-resolved\nexcitation spectrum of the one dimensional EHM in the CDW phase and clarify the\nrelation between different elementary energy gaps. We show that the CDW-to-BOW\ntransition is driven by the softening of a singlet exciton at momentum $\\pi$.\nThe BOW is realized as the condensate of this singlet exciton.\n", "  We present the complete twist-4 results for the semi-inclusive annihilation\nprocess $e^+ +e^- \\to h+ \\bar q+X$ at the tree level of perturbative quantum\nchromodynamics. The calculations are carried out by using the formalism\nobtained by applying the collinear expansion to this process where the multiple\ngluon scattering is taken into account and gauge links are obtained\nsystematically and automatically. We present the results for structure\nfunctions in terms of gauge invariant fragmentation functions up to twist-4 and\nthe corresponding results for the azimuthal asymmetries and polarizations of\nhadrons produced. The results obtained show in particular that similar to that\nfor semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering, for structure functions\nassociated with sine or cosine of odd number of azimuthal angle(s), there are\nonly twist-3 contributions, while for those of even number of azimuthal\nangle(s), there are leading twist and twist-4 contributions. For all those\nstructure functions that have leading twist contributions, there are twist-4\naddenda to them. Hence twist-4 contributions may even have large influences on\nextracting leading twist fragmentation functions from the data. We also suggest\na method for a rough estimation of twist-4 contributions based on the leading\ntwist fragmentation functions.\n", "  FO Aquarii, an asynchronous magnetic cataclysmic variable (intermediate\npolar) went into a low-state in 2016, from which it slowly and steadily\nrecovered without showing dwarf nova outbursts. This requires explanation since\nin a low-state, the mass-transfer rate is in principle too low for the disc to\nbe fully ionized and the disc should be subject to the standard thermal and\nviscous instability observed in dwarf novae. We investigate the conditions\nunder which an accretion disc in an intermediate polar could exhibit a\nluminosity drop of 2 magnitudes in the optical band without showing outbursts.\nWe use our numerical code for the time evolution of accretion discs, including\nother light sources from the system (primary, secondary, hot spot). We show\nthat although it is marginally possible for the accretion disc in the low-state\nto stay on the hot stable branch, the required mass-transfer rate in the normal\nstate would then have to be extremely high, of the order of 10$^{19}$ gs$^{-1}$\nor even larger. This would make the system so intrinsically bright that its\ndistance should be much larger than allowed by all estimates. We show that\nobservations of FO Aqr are well accounted for by the same mechanism that we\nhave suggested as explaining the absence of outbursts during low states of VY\nScl stars: during the decay, the magnetospheric radius exceeds the\ncircularization radius, so that the disc disappears before it enters the\ninstability strip for dwarf nova outbursts. Our results are unaffected, and\neven reinforced, if accretion proceeds both via the accretion disc and directly\nvia the stream during some intermediate stages; the detailed process through\nwhich the disc disappears still needs investigations.\n", "  The inorganic crystals have been widely used for dark matter direct searching\nfor many decades. However, limited by the crystal growth technique, a lot of\nsmall crystals have to be used together for large target mass, which results in\na degradation of light collection efficiency. An experiment was built up to\nstudy the degradation, and the method of soaking crystals into mineral oil to\nimprove the efficiency as well as reduce the interface effect were proposed and\nvalidated. Good data and MC agreements were achieved in the experiment.\n", "  In the context of scalar-tensor theories of gravity we compute the\nthird-order corrected spectral indices in the slow-roll approximation. The\ncalculation is carried out by employing the Green's function method for scalar\nand tensor perturbations in both the Einstein and Jordan frames. Then, using\nthe interrelations between the Hubble slow-roll parameters in the two frames we\nfind that the frames are equivalent up to third order. Since the Hubble\nslow-roll parameters are related to the potential slow-roll parameters, we\nexpress the observables in terms of the latter which are manifestly invariant.\nNevertheless, the same inflaton excursion leads to different predictions in the\ntwo frames since the definition of the number of e-folds differs. To illustrate\nthis effect we consider a nonminimal inflationary model and find that the\ndifference in the predictions grows with the nonminimal coupling and it can\nactually be larger than the difference between the first and third order\nresults for the observables. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of various\nend-of-inflation conditions on the observables. These effects will become\nimportant for the analyses of inflationary models in view of the improved\nsensitivity of future experiments.\n", "  We use the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation for numerically\naddressing the integer quantum Hall (IQH) regime in terms of many-body physics\nat higher Landau levels (LL). The results exhibit a strong tendency to avoid\nthe simultaneous existence of partly filled spin-up and spin-down LLs. Partly\nfilled LLs appear as a mixture of coexisting regions of full and empty LLs. We\nobtain edge stripes with approximately constant filling factor $\\nu$ close to\nhalf-odd filling at the boundaries between the regions of full and empty LLs,\nwhich we explain in terms of the $g$-factor enhancement as a function of a\nlocally varying $\\nu$ across the compressible stripes.The many-particle\ninteractions follow a behaviour as it would result from applying Hund's rule\nfor the occupation of the spin split LLs. The screening of the disorder and\nedge potential appears significantly reduced as compared to screening based on\na Thomas-Fermi approximation. For addressing carrier transport, we use a\nnon-equilibrium network model (NNM) that handles the lateral distribution of\nthe experimentally injected non-equilibrium chemical potentials $\\mu$.\n", "  Studying large-scale environments of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies\ngives a new perspective on their properties, particularly their radio loudness.\nThe large-scale environment is believed to have an impact on the evolution and\nintrinsic properties of galaxies, however, NLS1 sources have not been studied\nin this context before. We have a large and diverse sample of 1341 NLS1\ngalaxies and three separate environment data sets constructed using Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey. We use various statistical methods to investigate how the\nproperties of NLS1 galaxies are connected to the large-scale environment, and\ncompare the large-scale environments of NLS1 galaxies with other active galacic\nnuclei (AGN) classes, for example, other jetted AGN and broad-line Seyfert 1\n(BLS1) galaxies, to study how they are related. NLS1 galaxies reside in less\ndense environments than any of the comparison samples, thus confirming their\nyoung age. The average large-scale environment density and environmental\ndistribution of NLS1 sources is clearly different compared to BLS1 galaxies,\nthus it is improbable that they could be the parent population of NLS1 galaxies\nand unified by orientation. Within the NLS1 class there is a trend of\nincreasing radio loudness with increasing large-scale environment density,\nindicating that the large-scale environment affects their intrinsic properties.\nOur results suggest that the NLS1 class of sources is not homogeneous, and\nfurthermore, a considerable fraction of them are misclassified. We further\nsupport a published proposal to replace the traditional classification to\nradio-loud, and radio-quiet or radio-silent sources with a division to jetted\nand non-jetted sources.\n", "  Dispersionless \"zero energy mode'' is one of the hallmarks of frustrated\nkagome antiferromagnets (KAFMs). It points to extensive classically degenerate\nground-states. The \"zero energy mode'' can be observed experimentally when\nlifted to a flat mode at finite energy by a strong intrinsic magnetic\nanisotropy. In this letter, we study the effects of irradiation of laser light\non the KAFMs. We adopt the magnon picture without loss of generality. It is\nshown that circularly or linearly polarized light lifts the \"zero energy\nmode'', stabilizes magnetic order, and induces energy gaps in the KAFMs. We\nfind that the circularly polarized light-induced anisotropies have similar\nfeatures as the intrinsic in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction in KAFMs. The former stabilizes long-range magnetic order and the\nlatter induces spin canting out-of-plane with nonzero scalar spin chirality.\nThe Floquet thermal Hall effect shows that the synthetic magnetic excitation\nmodes in the case of circularly polarized light are topological, whereas those\nof linearly polarized light are not.\n", "  After having announced the statistically significant observation\n(5.6~$\\sigma$) of the new exotic $\\pi K$ atom, the DIRAC experiment at the CERN\nproton synchrotron presents the measurement of the corresponding atom lifetime,\nbased on the full $\\pi K$ data sample: $\\tau = (5.5^{+5.0}_{-2.8}) \\cdot\n10^{-15}s$. By means of a precise relation ($<1\\%$) between atom lifetime and\nscattering length, the following value for the S-wave isospin-odd $\\pi K$\nscattering length $a_0^{-}~=~\\frac{1}{3}(a_{1/2}-a_{3/2})$ has been derived:\n$\\left|a_0^-\\right| = (0.072^{+0.031}_{-0.020}) M_{\\pi}^{-1}$.\n", "  Two topics of high current interest in the field of unconventional\nsuperconductivity are non-centrosymmetric superconductors and multiband\nsuperconductivity. Half-Heusler superconductors such as YPtBi exemplify both.\nIn this paper, we study bulk and surface states in nodal superconducting phases\nof the half-Heusler compounds, belonging to the $A_1$ ($s+p$-like) and $T_2$\n($k_zk_x+ik_zk_y$-like) irreducible representations of the point group. These\ntwo phases preserve and break time-reversal symmetry, respectively. For the\n$A_1$ case, we find that flat surface bands persist in the multiband system. In\naddition, the system has dispersive surface bands with zero-energy crossings\nforming Fermi arcs, which are protected by mirror symmetries. For the $T_2$\ncase, there is an interesting coexistence of point and line nodes, known from\nthe single-band case, with Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (two-dimensional nodes).\nThere are no flat-band surface states, as expected, but dispersive surface\nbands with Fermi arcs exist. If these arcs do not lie in high-symmetry planes,\nthey are split by the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling so that their number is\ndoubled compared to the inversion-symmetric case.\n", "  The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 121102 was recently localized in a dwarf\ngalaxy at a cosmological distance. The dispersion measure (DM) derived for each\nburst from FRB 121102 so far has not shown significant evolution, even though\nan apparent increase was recently seen with newly detected VLA bursts. It is\nexpected that more repeating FRB sources may be detected in the future. In this\nwork, we investigate a list of possible astrophysical processes that might\ncause DM variation of a particular FRB source. The processes include (1) the\ncosmological scale effects such as Hubble expansion and large-scale structure\nfluctuations; (2) the FRB local effects such as gas density fluctuation,\nexpansion of a supernova remnant, a pulsar wind nebula, and an HII region; and\n(3) the propagation effect due to plasma lensing. We find that the DM\nvariations contributed by the large-scale structure are extremely small, and\nany observable DM variation is likely caused by the plasma local to the FRB\nsource. Besides mechanisms that produce decreasing DM with time, we suggest\nthat an FRB source in an expanding supernova remnant around a nearly neutral\nambient medium during the deceleration (Sedov-Taylor and snowplow) phases or in\na growing HII region can introduce DM increasing. Some effects (e.g. an FRB\nsource moving in an HII region or plasma lensing) can give either positive or\nnegative DM variations. Future observations of DM variations of FRB 121102 and\nother repeating FRB sources can bring important clues for the physical origin\nof these sources.\n", "  The technique of continuous unitary transformations has recently been used to\nprovide physical insight into a diverse array of quantum mechanical systems.\nHowever, the question of how to best numerically implement the flow equations\nhas received little attention. The most immediately apparent approach, using\nstandard Runge-Kutta numerical integration algorithms, suffers from both severe\ninefficiency due to stiffness and the loss of unitarity. After reviewing the\nformalism of continuous unitary transformations and Wegner's original choice\nfor the infinitesimal generator of the flow, we present a number of approaches\nto resolving these issues including a choice of generator which induces what we\ncall the \"uniform tangent decay flow\" and three numerical integrators\nspecifically designed to perform continuous unitary transformations efficiently\nwhile preserving the unitarity of flow. We conclude by applying one of the flow\nalgorithms to a simple calculation that visually demonstrates the many-body\nlocalization transition.\n", "  As a community, our goal is to understand the fundamental nature of energy,\nmatter, space, and time, and to apply that knowledge to understand the birth,\nevolution and fate of the universe. Our scope is broad and we use many tools:\naccelerator, non-accelerator & cosmological observations, all have a critical\nrole to play. The progress we have made towards our goal, the tools we need to\nprogress further, the opportunities we have for achieving transformational\nparadigm-altering scientific advances: great discoveries, and the importance of\nbeing a united global field to make progress toward our goal are the topics of\nthis talk.\n", "  We investigate how dynamic correlations of hard-core bosonic excitation at\nfinite temperature are affected by additional interactions besides the\nhard-core repulsion which prevents them from occupying the same site. We focus\nespecially on dimerized spin systems, where these additional interactions\nbetween the elementary excitations, triplons, lead to the formation of bound\nstates, relevant for the correct description of scattering processes. In order\nto include these effects quantitatively we extend the previously developed\nBr\\\"uckner approach to include also nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest\nneighbor (NNN) interactions correctly in a low-temperature expansion. This\nleads to the extension of the scalar Bethe-Salpeter equation to a matrix-valued\nequation. Exemplarily, we consider the Heisenberg spin ladder to illustrate the\nsignificance of the additional interactions on the spectral functions at finite\ntemperature which are proportional to inelastic neutron scattering rates.\n", "  Au-Fe alloys are of immense interest due to their biocompatibility, anomalous\nhall conductivity, and applications in various medical treatment. However,\nirrespective of the method of preparation, they often exhibit a high-level of\ndisorder, with properties sensitive to the thermal or magnetic annealing\ntemperatures. We calculate lattice dynamical properties of Au$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$\nalloys using density functional theory methods, where, being a multisite\nproperty, reliable interatomic force constant (IFC) calculations in disordered\nalloys remain a challenge. We follow a two fold approach: (1) an accurate IFC\ncalculation in an environment with nominally zero chemical pair correlations to\nmimic the homogeneously disordered alloy; and (2) a configurational averaging\nfor the desired phonon properties (e.g., dispersion, density of states, and\nentropy). We find an anomalous change in the IFC's and phonon dispersion (split\nbands) near $x$=0.19, which is attributed to the local stiffening of the Au-Au\nbonds when Au is in the vicinity of Fe. Other results based on mechanical and\nthermo-physical properties reflect a similar anomaly: Phonon entropy, e.g.,\nbecomes negative below $x$=0.19, suggesting a tendency for chemical unmixing,\nreflecting the onset of miscibility gap in the phase diagram. Our results match\nfairly well with reported data, wherever available.\n", "  We systematically investigate the neutron-skin thickness of neutron-rich\nnuclei within a compressible droplet model, which includes several parameters\ncharacterizing the surface tension and the equation of state (EOS) of\nasymmetric nuclear matter as well as corrections due to the surface\ndiffuseness. Such a systematic analysis helps towards constraining the EOS\nparameters of asymmetric nuclear matter and the poorly known density dependence\nof the surface tension; the latter is estimated with help of available\nexperimental data for the neutron and proton density distributions and the\nnuclear masses. Validity of the present approach is confirmed by calculating\nrealistic density distributions of Ca, Ni, Zr, Sn, Yb, and Pb isotopes within a\nmicroscopic Skyrme-Hartree-Fock+BCS method for various sets of the effective\nnuclear force. Our macroscopic model accompanied by the diffuseness corrections\nworks well in the sense that it well reproduces the evolution of the\nmicroscopically deduced neutron-skin thickness with respect to the neutron\nnumber for selected sets of the effective nuclear force. We find that the\nsurface tension of the compressible nuclear droplet is a key to bridging a gap\nbetween microscopic and macroscopic approaches.\n", "  As Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs) move into the petascale age,\nwhere the output from global high-resolution model runs can be of the order of\nhundreds of terabytes in size, tools to analyse the output of these models will\nneed to scale up too. Lagrangian Ocean Analysis, where virtual particles are\ntracked through hydrodynamic fields, is an increasingly popular way to analyse\nOGCM output, by mapping pathways and connectivity of biotic and abiotic\nparticulates. However, the current software stack of Lagrangian Ocean Analysis\ncodes is not dynamic enough to cope with the increasing complexity, scale and\nneed for customisation of use-cases. Furthermore, most community codes are\ndeveloped for stand-alone use, making it a nontrivial task to integrate virtual\nparticles at runtime of the OGCM. Here, we introduce the new Parcels code,\nwhich was designed from the ground up to be sufficiently scalable to cope with\npetascale computing. We highlight its API design that combines flexibility and\ncustomisation with the ability to optimise for HPC workflows, following the\nparadigm of domain-specific languages. Parcels is primarily written in Python,\nutilising the wide range of tools available in the scientific Python ecosystem,\nwhile generating low-level C-code and using Just-In-Time compilation for\nperformance-critical computation. We show a worked-out example of its API, and\nvalidate the accuracy of the code against seven idealised test cases. This\nversion~0.9 of Parcels is focussed on laying out the API, with future work\nconcentrating on optimisation, efficiency and at-runtime coupling with OGCMs.\n", "  The critcal exponent $\\omega$ is evaluated at $O(1/N)$ in $d$-dimensions in\nthe Gross-Neveu model using the large $N$ critical point formalism. It is shown\nto be in agreement with the recently determined three loop $\\beta$-functions of\nthe Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model in four dimensions. The same exponent is computed\nfor the chiral Gross-Neveu and non-abelian Nambu-Jona-Lasinio universality\nclasses.\n", "  We investigate the mean star formation rates (SFRs) in the host galaxies of\n~3000 optically selected QSOs from the SDSS survey within the Herschel-ATLAS\nfields, and a radio-luminous sub-sample, covering the redshift range of z =\n0.2-2.5. Using WISE & Herschel photometry (12 - 500{\\mu}m) we construct\ncomposite SEDs in bins of redshift and AGN luminosity. We perform SED fitting\nto measure the mean infrared luminosity due to star formation, removing the\ncontamination from AGN emission. We find that the mean SFRs show a weak\npositive trend with increasing AGN luminosity. However, we demonstrate that the\nobserved trend could be due to an increase in black hole (BH) mass (and a\nconsequent increase of inferred stellar mass) with increasing AGN luminosity.\nWe compare to a sample of X-ray selected AGN and find that the two populations\nhave consistent mean SFRs when matched in AGN luminosity and redshift. On the\nbasis of the available virial BH masses, and the evolving BH mass to stellar\nmass relationship, we find that the mean SFRs of our QSO sample are consistent\nwith those of main sequence star-forming galaxies. Similarly, the\nradio-luminous QSOs have mean SFRs that are consistent with both the overall\nQSO sample and with star-forming galaxies on the main sequence. In conclusion,\non average QSOs reside on the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, and the\nobserved positive trend between the mean SFRs and AGN luminosity can be\nattributed to BH mass and redshift dependencies.\n", "  We study different notions of quantum correlations in multipartite systems of\ndistinguishable and indistinguishable particles. Based on the definition of\nquantum coherence for a single particle, we consider two possible extensions of\nthis concept to the many-particle scenario and determine the influence of the\nexchange symmetry. Moreover, we characterize the relation of multiparticle\ncoherence to the entanglement of the compound quantum system. To support our\ngeneral treatment with examples, we consider the quantum correlations of a\ncollection of qudits. The impact of local and global quantum superpositions on\nthe different forms of quantum correlations is discussed. For differently\ncorrelated states in the bipartite and multipartite scenarios, we provide a\ncomprehensive characterization of the various forms and origins of quantum\ncorrelations.\n", "  The structure of the matrix elements of the energy-momentum tensor play an\nimportant role in determining the properties of the form factors $A(q^{2})$,\n$B(q^{2})$ and $C(q^{2})$ which appear in the Lorentz covariant decomposition\nof the matrix elements. In this paper we apply a rigorous frame-independent\ndistributional-matching approach to the matrix elements of the Poincar\\'{e}\ngenerators in order to derive constraints on these form factors as $q\n\\rightarrow 0$. In contrast to the literature, we explicitly demonstrate that\nthe vanishing of the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment $B(0)$ and the condition\n$A(0)=1$ are independent of one another, and that these constraints are not\nrelated to the specific properties or conservation of the individual\nPoincar\\'{e} generators themselves, but are in fact a consequence of the\nphysical on-shell requirement of the states in the matrix elements and the\nmanner in which these states transform under Poincar\\'{e} transformations.\n", "  We examine energy relaxation of non-equilibrium quasiparticles in \"dirty\"\nsuperconductors with the electron mean free path much shorter than the\nsuperconducting coherence length. Relaxation of low-energy non-equilibrium\nquasiparticles is dominated by phonon emission. We derive the corresponding\ncollision integral and find the quasiparticle relaxation rate. The latter is\nsensitive to the breaking of time reversal symmetry (TRS) by a magnetic field\n(or magnetic impurities). As a concrete application of the developed theory, we\naddress quasiparticle trapping by a vortex and a current-biased constriction.\nWe show that trapping of hot quasiparticles may predominantly occur at\ndistances from the vortex core, or the constriction, significantly exceeding\nthe superconducting coherence length.\n", "  We present ELDAR, a new method that exploits the potential of medium- and\nnarrow-band filter surveys to securely identify active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nand determine their redshifts. Our methodology improves on traditional\napproaches by looking for AGN emission lines expected to be identified against\nthe continuum, thanks to the width of the filters. To assess its performance,\nwe apply ELDAR to the data of the ALHAMBRA survey, which covered an effective\narea of $2.38\\,{\\rm deg}^2$ with 20 contiguous medium-band optical filters down\nto F814W$\\simeq 24.5$. Using two different configurations of ELDAR in which we\nrequire the detection of at least 2 and 3 emission lines, respectively, we\nextract two catalogues of type-I AGN. The first is composed of 585 sources\n($79\\,\\%$ of them spectroscopically-unknown) down to F814W$=22.5$ at $z_{\\rm\nphot}>1$, which corresponds to a surface density of $209\\,{\\rm deg}^{-2}$. In\nthe second, the 494 selected sources ($83\\,\\%$ of them\nspectroscopically-unknown) reach F814W$=23$ at $z_{\\rm phot}>1.5$, for a\ncorresponding number density of $176\\,{\\rm deg}^{-2}$. Then, using samples of\nspectroscopically-known AGN in the ALHAMBRA fields, for the two catalogues we\nestimate a completeness of $73\\,\\%$ and $67\\,\\%$, and a redshift precision of\n$1.01\\,\\%$ and $0.86\\,\\%$ (with outliers fractions of $8.1\\,\\%$ and $5.8\\,\\%$).\nAt $z>2$, where our selection performs best, we reach $85\\,\\%$ and $77\\,\\%$\ncompleteness and we find no contamination from galaxies.\n", "  If the mass excess of neutron-deficient nuclei and their neutron-rich mirror\npartners are both known, it can be shown that deviations of the Isobaric Mass\nMultiplet Equation (IMME) in the form of a cubic term can be probed. Such a\ncubic term was probed by using the atomic mass of neutron-rich magnesium\nisotopes measured using the TITAN Penning trap and the recently measured\nproton-separation energies of $^{29}$Cl and $^{30}$Ar. The atomic mass of\n$^{27}$Mg was found to be within 1.6$\\sigma$ of the value stated in the Atomic\nMass Evaluation. The atomic masses of $^{28,29}$Mg were measured to be both\nwithin 1$\\sigma$, while being 8 and 34 times more precise, respectively. Using\nthe $^{29}$Mg mass excess and previous measurements of $^{29}$Cl we uncovered a\ncubic coefficient of $d$ = 28(7) keV, which is the largest known cubic\ncoefficient of the IMME. This departure, however, could also be caused by\nexperimental data with unknown systematic errors. Hence there is a need to\nconfirm the mass excess of $^{28}$S and the one-neutron separation energy of\n$^{29}$Cl, which have both come from a single measurement. Finally, our results\nwere compared to ab initio calculations from the valence-space in-medium\nsimilarity renormalization group, resulting in a good agreement.\n", "  Critical transitions occur in a variety of dynamical systems. Here, we employ\nquantifiers of chaos to identify changes in the dynamical structure of complex\nsystems preceding critical transitions. As suitable indicator variables for\ncritical transitions, we consider changes in growth rates and directions of\ncovariant Lyapunov vectors. Studying critical transitions in several models of\nfast-slow systems, i.e., a network of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators,\nmodels for Josephson junctions and the Hindmarsh-Rose model, we find that\ntangencies between covariant Lyapunov vectors are a common and maybe generic\nfeature during critical transitions. We further demonstrate that this deviation\nfrom hyperbolic dynamics is linked to the occurrence of critical transitions by\nusing it as an indicator variable and evaluating the prediction success through\nreceiver operating characteristic curves. In the presence of noise, we find the\nalignment of covariant Lyapunov vectors and changes in finite-time Lyapunov\nexponents to be more successful in announcing critical transitions than common\nindicator variables as, e.g., finite-time estimates of the variance.\nAdditionally, we propose a new method for estimating approximations of\ncovariant Lyapunov vectors without knowledge of the future trajectory of the\nsystem. We find that these approximated covariant Lyapunov vectors can also be\napplied to predict critical transitions.\n", "  The Random Phase Approximation (RPA) for total energies has previously been\nshown to provide a qualitatively correct description of static correlation in\nmolecular systems, where density functional theory (DFT) with local functionals\nare bound to fail. This immediately poses the question of whether the RPA is\nalso able to capture the correct physics of strongly correlated solids such as\nMott insulators. Due to strong electron localization, magnetic interactions in\nsuch systems are dominated by superexchange, which in the simplest picture can\nbe regarded as the analogue of static correlation for molecules. In the present\nwork we investigate the performance of the RPA for evaluating both\nsuperexchange and direct exchange interactions in the magnetic solids NiO, MnO,\nNa3Cu2SbO6, Sr2CuO3, Sr2CuTeO6, and a monolayer of CrI3, which are chosen to\nrepresent a broad variety of magnetic interactions. It is found that the RPA\ncan accurately correct the large errors introduced by Hartree-Fock -\nindependent of the input orbitals used for the perturbative expansion. However,\nin most cases, accuracies similar to RPA can be obtained with DFT+U, which is\nsignificantly simpler from a computational point of view.\n", "  In quantum communications, vortex photons can encode higher-dimensional\nquantum states and build high-dimensional communication networks (HDCNs). The\ninterfaces that connect different wavelengths are significant in HDCNs. We\nconstruct a coherent orbital angular momentum (OAM) frequency bridge via\ndifference frequency conversion in a nonlinear bulk crystal for HDCNs. Using a\nsingle resonant cavity, maximum quantum conversion efficiencies from visible to\ninfrared are 36\\%, 15\\%, and 7.8\\% for topological charges of 0,1, and 2,\nrespectively. The average fidelity obtained using quantum state tomography for\nthe down-converted infrared OAM-state of topological charge 1 is 96.51\\%. We\nalso prove that the OAM is conserved in this process by measuring visible and\ninfrared interference patterns. This coherent OAM frequency-down conversion\nbridge represents a basis for an interface between two high-dimensional quantum\nsystems operating with different spectra.\n", "  Nanoscale twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is quite instable and will change\nits structure to Bernal (or AB-stacking) bilayer with a much lower energy.\nTherefore, the lack of nanoscale TBG makes its electronic properties not\naccessible in experiment up to now. In this work, a special confined TBG is\nobtained in the overlaid area of two continuous misoriented graphene sheets.\nThe width of the confined region of the TBG changes gradually from about 22 nm\nto 0 nm. By using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we studied carefully the\nstructure and the electronic properties of the nanoscale TBG. Our results\nindicate that the low-energy electronic properties, including twist-induced van\nHove singularities (VHSs) and spatial modulation of local density-of-state, are\nstrongly affected by the translational symmetry breaking of the nanoscale TBG.\nWhereas, the electronic properties above the energy of the VHSs are almost not\ninfluenced by the quantum confinement even when the width of the TBG is reduced\nto only a single moire spot.\n", "  In this article, we study the scalar-diquark-scalar-diquark-scalar-diquark\ntype hexaquark state with the QCD sum rules by carrying out the operator\nproduct expansion up to the vacuum condensates of dimension 16. We obtain the\nlowest hexaquark mass $6.60^{+0.12}_{-0.09}\\,\\rm{GeV}$, which can be confronted\nto the experimental data in the future.\n", "  Somewhat surprisingly, in many of the widely used monographs and review\narticles the term Transverse-Traceless modes of linearized gravitational waves\nis used to denote two entirely different notions. These treatments generally\nbegin with a decomposition of the metric perturbation that is local in the\nmomentum space (and hence non-local in physical space), and denote the\nresulting transverse traceless modes by $h_{ab}^{\\TT}$. However, while\ndiscussing gravitational waves emitted by an isolated system --typically in a\nlater section-- the relevant modes are extracted using a `projection operator'\nthat is local in physical space. These modes are also called\ntransverse-traceless and again labeled $h_{ab}^{\\TT}$, implying that this is\njust a reformulation of the previous notion. But the two notions are\nconceptually distinct and the difference persists even in the asymptotic\nregion. We show that this confusion arises already in Maxwell theory that is\noften discussed as a prelude to the gravitational case. Finally, we discuss why\nthe distinction has nonetheless remained largely unnoticed, and also point out\nthat there are some important physical effects where only one of the notions\ngives the correct answer.\n", "  Merging galaxy clusters present a unique opportunity to study the properties\nof dark matter in an astrophysical context. These are rare and extreme cosmic\nevents in which the bulk of the baryonic matter becomes displaced from the dark\nmatter halos of the colliding subclusters. Since all mass bends light, weak\ngravitational lensing is a primary tool to study the total mass distribution in\nsuch systems. Combined with X-ray and optical analyses, mass maps of cluster\nmergers reconstructed from weak-lensing observations have been used to\nconstrain the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter. The dynamically\ncomplex Abell 520 (A520) cluster is an exceptional case, even among merging\nsystems: multi-wavelength observations have revealed a surprising high\nmass-to-light concentration of dark mass, the interpretation of which is\ndifficult under the standard assumption of effectively collisionless dark\nmatter. We revisit A520 using a new sparsity-based mass-mapping algorithm to\nindependently assess the presence of the puzzling dark core. We obtain\nhigh-resolution mass reconstructions from two separate galaxy shape catalogs\nderived from Hubble Space Telescope observations of the system. Our mass maps\nagree well overall with the results of previous studies, but we find important\ndifferences. In particular, although we are able to identify the dark core at a\ncertain level in both data sets, it is at much lower significance than has been\nreported before using the same data. As we cannot confirm the detection in our\nanalysis, we do not consider A520 as posing a significant challenge to the\ncollisionless dark matter scenario.\n", "  We show that scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis (SEMPA)\nthat is sensitive to both in-plane magnetization components can be used to\nimage the out-of-plane magnetized multi-domain state in multilayered chiral\nspin textures. By depositing a thin layer of Fe on top of the multilayer we\nimage the underlying out-of-plane domain state through the mapping of its stray\nfields in the Fe. We also demonstrate that SEMPA can be used to image the\ndomain wall chirality in these systems after milling away the capping layer and\nimaging the topmost magnetic layer directly.\n", "  We investigate the masses of \"retired A stars\" using asteroseismic detections\non seven low-luminosity red-giant and sub-giant stars observed by the NASA\nKepler and K2 Missions. Our aim is to explore whether masses derived from\nspectroscopy and isochrone fitting may have been systematically overestimated.\nOur targets have all previously been subject to long term radial velocity\nobservations to detect orbiting bodies, and satisfy the criteria used by\nJohnson et al. (2006) to select survey stars that may have had A-type (or early\nF-type) main-sequence progenitors. The sample actually spans a somewhat wider\nrange in mass, from $\\approx 1\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}$ up to $\\approx 1.7\\,\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$. Whilst for five of the seven stars the reported discovery mass from\nspectroscopy exceeds the mass estimated using asteroseismology, there is no\nstrong evidence for a significant, systematic bias across the sample. Moreover,\ncomparisons with other masses from the literature show that the absolute scale\nof any differences is highly sensitive to the chosen reference literature mass,\nwith the scatter between different literature masses significantly larger than\nreported error bars. We find that any mass difference can be explained through\nuse of differing constraints during the recovery process. We also conclude that\nunderestimated uncertainties on the input parameters can significantly bias the\nrecovered stellar masses, which may have contributed to the controversy on the\nmass scale for retired A stars.\n", "  We study the narrowest spectra expected from gamma-ray bursts. We present an\nanalytical function for the spectrum that is emitted from the photosphere of a\nradiation-dominated flow that is under acceleration. This is the narrowest\npossible spectrum and it differs from a Planck function. We also present\nnumerical spectra from photospheres occurring during the transition into the\ncoasting phase of the flow. Using these spectral models, we reanalyse Fermi\nobservations of GRB100507 and GRB101219, which both have been reported to have\nvery narrow spectra. The bursts can be fitted by the spectral models: For\nGRB101219 the spectrum is consistent with the photosphere occurring below or\nclose to the saturation radius, while for GRB100507 the photosphere position\nrelative to the saturation radius can be determined as a function of time. In\nthe latter case, we find that the photosphere initially occurs in the\nacceleration phase and thereafter transitions into the coasting phase. We also\nfind that this transition occurs at the same time as the change in observed\ncooling behaviour: the temperature is close to constant before the break and\ndecays after. We argue that such a transition can be explained by an increasing\nmass outflow rate. Both analysed bursts thus give strong evidence that the jets\nare (initially) radiation dominated.\n", "  The Refined Gribov-Zwanziger framework takes into account the existence of\nequivalent gauge field configurations in the gauge-fixing quantization\nprocedure of Euclidean Yang-Mills theories. Recently, this setup was extended\nto the family of linear covariant gauges giving rise to a local and\nBRST-invariant action. In this paper, we give an algebraic proof of the\nrenormalizability of the resulting action to all orders in perturbation theory.\n", "  We explicitly calculate the disk-level S-matrix element of two closed string\nR-R and one open string NS vertex operators in RNS formalism. We show that the\namplitude satisfies various duality Ward identities. In particular, when one of\nthe R-R is zero-form, the other one is two-form and the NS state is gauge\nboson, the amplitude transforms under S-duality Ward identity to the amplitude\nof one dilaton, one B-field and one gauge boson which has been recently\ncalculated explicitly.\n  We have also proposed a soft theorem for disk-level scattering amplitude of\narbitrary number of hard closed strings and one soft open string at the leading\norder of soft momentum, and shown that the above amplitude satisfies the soft\ntheorem.\n", "  To gain a better understanding of the inner disc region that comprises active\ngalactic nuclei it is necessary to understand the pattern in which the disc is\nilluminated (the emissivity profile) by X-rays emitted from the continuum\nsource above the black hole (corona). The differences in the emissivity\nprofiles produced by various corona geometries are explored via general\nrelativistic ray tracing simulations. Through the analysis of various\nparameters of the geometries simulated it is found that emissivity profiles\nproduced by point source and extended geometries such as cylindrical slabs and\nspheroidal coronae placed on the accretion disc are distinguishable. Profiles\nproduced by point source and conical geometries are not significantly\ndifferent, requiring an analysis of reflection fraction to differentiate the\ntwo geometries. Beamed point and beamed conical sources are also simulated in\nan effort to model jet-like coronae, though the differences here are most\nevident in the reflection fraction. For a point source we determine an\napproximation for the measured reflection fraction with the source height and\nvelocity. Simulating spectra from the emissivity profiles produced by the\nvarious geometries produce distinguishable differences. Overall spectral\ndifferences between the geometries do not exceed 15 per cent in the most\nextreme cases. It is found that emissivity profiles can be useful in\ndistinguishing point source and extended geometries given high quality spectral\ndata of extreme, bright sources over long exposure times. In combination with\nreflection fraction, timing, and spectral analysis we may use emissivity\nprofiles to discern the geometry of the X-ray source.\n", "  Exoplanet surveys have shown that systems with multiple low-mass planets on\ncompact orbits are common. Except for few cases, however, the masses of these\nplanets are generally unknown. At the very end of the main sequence, host stars\nhave the lowest mass and hence offer the largest reflect motion for a given\nplanet. In that context, we monitored the low-mass (0.13Msun) M dwarf YZ Cet\n(GJ 54.1, HIP 5643) intensively and obtained both radial velocities and\nstellar-activity indicators derived from both spectroscopy and photometry. We\nfind strong evidence that it is orbited by at least three planets in compact\norbits (P=1.97, 3.06, 4.66 days), with the inner two near a 2:3 mean-motion\nresonance. The minimum masses are comparable to that of Earth\n(Msini=0.75+-0.13, 0.98+-0.14, and 1.14+-0.17 Mearth) and also the lowest\nmasses measured by radial velocity so far. We note the possibility for an even\nlower-mass, fourth planet with Msini=0.472+-0.096 Mearth at P=1.04 days. An\nn-body dynamical model is used to put further constraints on the system\nparameters. At 3.6 parsecs, YZ Cet is the nearest multi-planet system detected\nto date.\n", "  The microquasar Cygnus X-3 was observed several times with the Gemini North\nInfrared Spectrograph while the source was in the hard X-ray state. We describe\nthe observed 1.0-2.4 $\\mu$m spectra as arising from the stellar wind of the\ncompanion star and suggest its classification as a WN 4-6 Wolf-Rayet star. We\nattribute the orbital variations of the emission line profiles to the\nvariations in the ionization structure of the stellar wind caused by the\nintense X-ray emission from the compact object. The strong variability observed\nin the line profiles will affect the mass function determination. We are unable\nto reproduce earlier results, from which the mass function for the Wolf-Rayet\nstar was derived. Instead, we suggest that the system parameters are difficult\nto obtain from the infrared spectra. We find that the near-infrared continuum\nand the line spectra can be represented with non-LTE Wolf-Rayet atmosphere\nmodels if taking into account the effects arising from the peculiar ionization\nstructure of the stellar wind in an approximative manner. From the\nrepresentative models, we infer the properties of the Wolf-Rayet star and\ndiscuss possible mass ranges for the binary components.\n", "  We present 13 new 2175 {\\AA} dust absorbers at z_abs = 1.0 - 2.2 towards\nbackground quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These absorbers are\nexamined in detail using data from the Echelle Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) on\nthe Keck II telescope. Many low-ionization lines including Fe II, Zn II, Mg II,\nSi II, Al II, Ni II, Mn II, Cr II, Ti II, and Ca II are present in the same\nabsorber which gives rise to the 2175 {\\AA} bump. The relative metal abundances\n(with respect to Zn) demonstrate that the depletion patterns of our 2175 {\\AA}\ndust absorbers resemble that of the Milky Way clouds although some are\ndisk-like and some are halo-like. The 2175 {\\AA} dust absorbers have\nsignificantly higher depletion levels compared to literature Damped\nLyman-{\\alpha} absorbers (DLAs) and subDLAs. The dust depletion level indicator\n[Fe/Zn] tends to anti-correlate with bump strengths. The velocity profiles from\nthe Keck/ESI spectra also provide kinematical information on the dust\nabsorbers. The dust absorbers are found to have multiple velocity components\nwith velocity widths extending from ~100 to ~ 600 km/s, which are larger than\nthose of most DLAs and subDLAs. Assuming the velocity width is a reliable\ntracer of stellar mass, the host galaxies of 2175 {\\AA} dust absorbers are\nexpected to be more massive than DLA/subDLA hosts. Not all of the 2175 {\\AA}\ndust absorbers are intervening systems towards background quasars. The\nabsorbers towards quasars J1006+1538 and J1047+3423 are proximate systems that\ncould be associated with the quasar itself or the host galaxy.\n", "  The interstellar medium is a complex 'ecosystem' with gas constituents in the\natomic, molecular, and ionized states, dust, magnetic fields, and relativistic\nparticles. The Canadian Galactic Plane Survey has imaged these constituents\nwith angular resolution of the order of arcminutes. This paper presents radio\ncontinuum data at 408 MHz over the area 52 degrees < longitude < 193 degrees,\n-6.5 degrees < latitude < 8.5 degrees, with an extension to latitude = 21\ndegrees in the range 97 degrees < longitude < 120 degrees, with angular\nresolution 2.8' x 2.8' cosec(declination). Observations were made with the\nSynthesis Telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory as part of\nthe Canadian Galactic Plane Survey. The calibration of the survey using\nexisting radio source catalogs is described. The accuracy of 408-MHz flux\ndensities from the data is 6%. Information on large structures has been\nincorporated into the data using the single-antenna survey of Haslam (1982).\nThe paper presents the data, describes how it can be accessed electronically,\nand gives examples of applications of the data to ISM research.\n", "  In this paper we study the morphological properties of spiral galaxies,\nincluding measurements of spiral arm number and pitch angle. Using Galaxy Zoo\n2, a stellar mass-complete sample of 6,222 SDSS spiral galaxies is selected. We\nuse the machine vision algorithm SpArcFiRe to identify spiral arm features and\nmeasure their associated geometries. A support vector machine classifier is\nemployed to identify reliable spiral features, with which we are able to\nestimate pitch angles for half of our sample. We use these machine measurements\nto calibrate visual estimates of arm tightness, and hence estimate pitch angles\nfor our entire sample. The properties of spiral arms are compared with respect\nto various galaxy properties. The star formation properties of galaxies vary\nsignificantly with arm number, but not pitch angle. We find that galaxies\nhosting strong bars have spiral arms substantially ($4-6^\\mathrm{o}$) looser\nthan unbarred galaxies. Accounting for this, spiral arms associated with\nmany-arm structures are looser (by 2$^\\mathrm{o}$) than those in two-arm\ngalaxies. In contrast to this average trend, galaxies with greater\nbulge-to-total stellar mass ratios display both fewer and looser spiral arms.\nThis effect is primarily driven by the galaxy disc, such that galaxies with\nmore massive discs contain more spiral arms with tighter pitch angles. This\nimplies that galaxy central mass concentration is not the dominant cause of\npitch angle and arm number variations between galaxies, which in turn suggests\nthat not all spiral arms are governed by classical density waves or modal\ntheories.\n", "  We study the near-infrared properties of 690 Mira candidates in the central\nregion of the Large Magellanic Cloud, based on time-series observations at\nJHKs. We use densely-sampled I-band observations from the OGLE project to\ngenerate template light curves in the near infrared and derive robust mean\nmagnitudes at those wavelengths. We obtain near-infrared Period-Luminosity\nrelations for Oxygen-rich Miras with a scatter as low as 0.12 mag at Ks. We\nstudy the Period-Luminosity-Color relations and the color excesses of\nCarbon-rich Miras, which show evidence for a substantially different reddening\nlaw.\n", "  We analyze the energy configuration of a charged black hole in the\nTeleparallel Framework of General Relativity. We obtain the energy-momentum\ntensor of the gravitational field in a stationary frame, and we calculate its\ncontribution to the total energy of the system. We study the same gravitational\nfield measured by an accelerated frame and we analyze how the energy-momentum\ntensor is transformed. We found that in the accelerated frame, a Poyinting-like\nflux appears for the gravitational field but not for the electromagnetic field.\n", "  The highest pressure form of the major Earth-forming mantle silicate is\nMgSiO3 post-perovskite (PPv). Understanding the fate of PPv at TPa pressures is\nthe first step for understanding the mineralogy of super-Earths-type\nexoplanets, arguably the most interesting for their similarities with Earth.\nModeling their internal structure requires knowledge of stable mineral phases,\ntheir properties under compression, and major element abundances. Several\nstudies of PPv under extreme pressures support the notion that a sequence of\npressure induced dissociation transitions produce the elementary oxides SiO2\nand MgO as the ultimate aggregation form at ~3 TPa. However, none of these\nstudies have addressed the problem of mantle composition, particularly major\nelement abundances usually expressed in terms of three main variables, the\nMg/Si and Fe/Si ratios and the Mg#, as in the Earth. Here we show that the\ncritical compositional parameter, the Mg/Si ratio, whose value in the Earth's\nmantle is still debated, is a vital ingredient for modeling phase transitions\nand internal structure of super-Earth mantles. Specifically, we have identified\nnew sequences of phase transformations, including new recombination reactions\nthat depend decisively on this ratio. This is a new level of complexity that\nhas not been previously addressed, but proves essential for modeling the nature\nand number of internal layers in these rocky mantles.\n", "  Orbital advection is a significant bottleneck in disk simulations, and a\nparticularly tricky one when used in connection with magnetohydrodynamics. We\nhave developed an orbital advection algorithm suitable for the induction\nequation with magnetic potential. The electromotive force is split into\nadvection and shear term, and we find that we do not need an advective gauge as\nsolving the orbital advection implicitly precludes the shear term from\ncanceling the advection term. We prove and demonstrate the third order in time\naccuracy of the scheme. The algorithm is also suited for non-magnetic problems.\nBenchmarked results of (hydrodynamical) planet-disk interaction and the of the\nmagnetorotational instability are reproduced. We include detailed descriptions\nof the construction and selection of stabilizing dissipations (or high\nfrequency filters) needed to generate practical results. The scheme is\nself-consistent, accurate, and elegant in its simplicity, making it\nparticularly efficiently in straightforward finite-difference methods. As a\nresult of the work, the algorithm is incorporated in the public version of the\nPencil Code, where it can be used by the community.\n", "  High precision data of lepton angular distributions for $\\gamma^*/Z$\nproduction in $pp$ collisions at the LHC, covering broad ranges of dilepton\ntransverse momenta ($q_T$) and rapidity ($y$), were recently reported. Strong\n$q_T$ dependencies were observed for several angular distribution coefficients,\n$A_i$, including $A_0 - A_4$. Significant $y$ dependencies were also found for\nthe coefficients $A_1$, $A_3$ and $A_4$, while $A_0$ and $A_2$ exhibit very\nweak rapidity dependence. Using an intuitive geometric picture we show that the\n$q_T$ and $y$ dependencies of the angular distributions coefficients can be\nwell described.\n", "  Star clusters are invaluable tracers of the Galactic components and the\ndiscovery and characterization of low-mass stellar systems can be used to\nappraise their prevailing disruption mechanisms and time scales. However, owing\nto the significant foreground contamination, high extinction, and still\nuncharted interfaces of the underlying Milky Way components, objects at low\nGalactic latitudes are notoriously difficult to characterize. Here, we present\nthe first spectroscopic campaign to identify the chemodynamical properties of\nthe low-latitude star cluster FSR 1716. While its photometric age and distance\nare far from settled, the presence of RR Lyrae variables indicates a rather old\ncluster variety. Using medium-resolution (R$\\sim$10600) calcium triplet (CaT)\nspectroscopy obtained with the wide-field multi-fibre AAOmega instrument, we\nidentified six member candidates with a mean velocity of $-30$ km s$^{-1}$ and\na velocity dispersion of 2.5$\\pm$0.9 km s$^{-1}$. The latter value implies a\ndynamic mass of $\\sim$1.3$\\times$10$^4$ M$_{\\odot}$, typical of a low-mass\nglobular cluster. Combined with our derived CaT metallicity of $-1.38\\pm0.20$\ndex, this object is finally confirmed as an old, metal-poor globular cluster.\n", "  The near horizon geometry of general black holes in equilibrium can be\nconveniently characterized in the formalism of weakly isolated horizons in the\nform of the Bondi-like expansions (Krishnan B, Class.\\ Quantum Grav.\\ 29,\n205006, 2012). While the intrinsic geometry of the Kerr-Newman black hole has\nbeen extensively investigated in the weakly isolated horizon framework, the\noff-horizon description in the Bondi-like system employed by Krishnan has not\nbeen studied. We extend Krishnan's work by explicit, non-perturbative\nconstruction of the Bondi-like tetrad in the full Kerr-Newman spacetime.\nNamely, we construct the Bondi-like tetrad which is parallelly propagated along\na nontwisting null geodesic congruence transversal to the horizon and provide\nall Newman-Penrose scalars associated with this tetrad. This work completes the\ndescription of the Kerr-Newman spacetime in the formalism of weakly isolated\nhorizons and is a starting point for the investigation of deformed black holes.\n", "  We analyze the stellar populations and evolutionary history of\nbulge-dominated field galaxies at redshifts 0.3<z<1.2 as part of the Gemini/HST\nGalaxy Cluster Project (GCP). High signal-to-noise optical spectroscopy from\nthe Gemini Observatory and imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope are used to\nanalyze a total of 43 galaxies, focusing on the 30 passive galaxies in the\nsample. Using the size-mass and velocity dispersion-mass relations for the\npassive field galaxies we find no significant evolution of sizes or velocity\ndispersions at a given dynamical mass between z~1 and the present. We establish\nthe Fundamental Plane and study mass-to-light (M/L) ratios. The M/L vs.\ndynamical mass relation shows that the passive field galaxies follow a relation\nwith a steeper slope than the local comparison sample, consistent with cluster\ngalaxies in the GCP at z=0.86. This steeper slope indicates that the formation\nredshift is mass dependent, in agreement with \"downsizing,\" meaning that the\nlow mass galaxies formed their stars more recently while the high mass galaxies\nformed their stars at higher redshift. The zero point differences of the\nscaling relations for the M/L ratios imply a formation redshift of\nz_form=1.35(+0.10)(-0.07) for the passive field galaxies. This is consistent\nwith the (Hdelta_A + Hgamma_A)' line index which implies a formation redshift\nof z_form=1.40(+0.60)(-0.18).\n", "  In this letter, using the rainbow functions that were proposed by Magueijo\nand Smolin, we investigate the thermodynamics and the phase transition of\nrainbow Schwarzschild black hole. First, we calculate the rainbow gravity\ncorrected Hawking temperature. From this modification, we then derive the local\ntemperature, free energy, and other thermodynamic quantities in an isothermal\ncavity. Finally, we analyze the critical behavior, thermodynamic stability, and\nphase transition of the rainbow Schwarzschild black hole. The results show that\nthe rainbow gravity can stop the Hawking radiation in the final stages of black\nholes' evolution and lead to the remnants of black holes. Furthermore, one can\nobserve that the rainbow Schwarzschild black hole has one first-order phase\ntransition, two second-order phase transitions, and three Hawking-Page-type\nphase transitions in the framework of rainbow gravity theory.\n", "  Orion-KL is a well known high mass star forming region that has long been the\ntarget of spectral line surveys and searches for complex molecules. One\nspectral window where the region had never been surveyed is around wavelengths\nof $\\lambda$=1 cm. This is an important window to observe due to the\nfundamental and low energy transitions of numerous complex molecules that\nindicate the maximum spatial extent of the molecular species; knowing the\nspatial distribution of a molecule aids in determining the formation\nmechanism(s) of that molecule. Additionally, there are fewer transitions in\nthis window, reducing confusion caused by blended lines that can be very\nproblematic at shorter wavelengths ($\\lambda<$3 mm). In this work, we present\nthe first spectral line survey at $\\lambda$=1 cm of the Orion-KL region. A\ntotal of 89 transitions were detected from 14 molecular species and\nisotopologues and two atomic species. The observations were conducted with the\nCombined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy in both\ninterferometric and single dish modes.\n", "  The process of planet formation offers a rich source of dust production via\ngrain growth in protostellar discs, and via grinding of larger bodies in debris\ndisc systems. Chemical evolution models, designed to follow the build up of\nmetals and dust in galaxies, do not currently account for planet formation. We\nconsider the possibility that the apparent under-prediction of dust mass in\nhigh redshift galaxies by chemical evolution models could be in part, due to\nthese models neglecting this process, specifically due to their assumption that\na large fraction of the dust mass is removed from the interstellar medium\nduring star formation (so-called astration). By adding a planet formation phase\ninto galaxy chemical evolution, we demonstrate that the dust budget crisis can\nbe partially ameliorated by a factor of 1.3-1.5 only if a) circumstellar discs\nprevent a large fraction of the dust mass entering the star during its birth,\nand b) that dust mass is preferentially liberated via jets, winds and outflows\nrather than accreted into planetary-mass bodies.\n", "  We analyze the optical continuum of star-forming galaxies in SDSS by fitting\nstacked spectra with stellar population synthesis models to investigate the\nrelation between stellar mass, stellar metallicity, dust attenuation and star\nformation rate. We fit models calculated with star formation and chemical\nevolution histories that are derived empirically from multi-epoch observations\nof the stellar mass---star formation rate and the stellar mass---gas-phase\nmetallicity relations, respectively. We also fit linear combinations of single\nburst models with a range of metallicities and ages. Star formation and\nchemical evolution histories are unconstrained for these models. The stellar\nmass---stellar metallicity relations obtained from the two methods agree with\nthe relation measured from individual supergiant stars in nearby galaxies.\nThese relations are also consistent with the relation obtained from emission\nline analysis of gas-phase metallicity after accounting for systematic offsets\nin the gas-phase-metallicity. We measure dust attenuation of the stellar\ncontinuum and show that its dependence on stellar mass and star formation rate\nis consistent with previously reported results derived from nebular emission\nlines. However, stellar continuum attenuation is smaller than nebular emission\nline attenuation. The continuum-to-nebular attenuation ratio depends on stellar\nmass and is smaller in more massive galaxies. Our consistent analysis of\nstellar continuum and nebular emission lines paves the way for a comprehensive\ninvestigation of stellar metallicities of star-forming and quiescent galaxies.\n", "  The $\\eta$ ring is one of the narrow rings of Uranus, consisting of a dense\ncore that is 1-2 km wide and a diffuse outer sheet spanning about 40 km. Its\ndense core lies just exterior to the 3:2 Inner Lindblad Resonance of the small\nmoon Cressida. We fit the $\\eta$ ring radius residuals and longitudes from a\ncomplete set of both ground-based and Voyager stellar and radio occultations of\nthe Uranian rings spanning 1977-2002. We find variations in the radial position\nof the $\\eta$ ring that are likely generated by this resonance, and take the\nform of a 3-lobed structure rotating at an angular rate equal to the mean\nmotion of the moon Cressida. The amplitude of these radial oscillations is\n$0.667\\pm0.113$ km, which is consistent with the expected shape due to the\nperturbations from Cressida. The magnitude of these variations provides the\nfirst measurement of the mass and density of the moon Cressida\n($m=2.5\\pm0.4\\times10^{17}$ kg and $\\rho=0.86\\pm0.16$ g/cm$^3$) or, indeed, any\nof Uranus' small inner moons. A better grasp of inner Uranian satellite masses\nwill provide another clue to the composition, dynamical stability, and history\nof Uranus' tightly packed system of small moons.\n", "  Secondary eclipses and phase curves reveal information about the reflectivity\nand heat distribution in exoplanet atmospheres. The phase curve is composed of\na combination of reflected, and thermally emitted light from the planet, and\nfor circular orbits the phase curve peaks during the secondary eclipse or at an\norbital phase of 0.5. Physical mechanisms have been discovered which shift the\nphase curve maximum of tidally locked close in planets to the right, or left,\nof the secondary eclipse. These mechanisms include cloud formations, and\natmospheric superrotation, both of which serve to shift the thermally bright\nhot-spot, or highly reflective bright spot, of the atmosphere away from the\nsub-stellar point. Here we present a methodology for optimizing observing\nstrategies for both secondary eclipses and phase curves with the goal of\nmaximizing the information gained about the planetary atmosphere while\nminimizing the (assumed) continuous observation time. We show that we can\nincrease the duty cycle of observations aimed at the measurements of phase\ncurve characteristics (Amplitude, Phase offset) by up to $50\\%$ for future\nplatforms such as CHEOPS and JWST. We apply this methodology to the test cases\nof the Spitzer phase curve of 55-Cancri-e, which displays an eastward shift in\nits phase curve maximum, as well as model-generated observations of an\nultra-short period planet observed with CHEOPS.\n", "  In this study we investigate jet interaction at a microscopic level in a\ncosmological environment, which responds to a key open question in the study of\nrelativistic jets. Using small simulation systems during prior research, we\ninitially studied the evolution of both electron-proton and electron-positron\nrelativistic jets containing helical magnetic fields, by focusing on their\ninteractions with an ambient plasma. Here, using larger jet radii, we have\nperformed simulations of global jets containing helical magnetic fields in\norder to examine how helical magnetic fields affect kinetic instabilities such\nas the Weibel instability, the kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (kKHI) and\nthe Mushroom instability (MI). We found that the evolution of global jets\nstrongly depends on the size of the jet radius. For example, phase bunching of\njet electrons, in particular in the electron-proton jet, is mixed with larger\njet radius due to the more complicated structures of magnetic fields with\nexcited kinetic instabilities. In our simulation study these kinetic\ninstabilities lead to new types of instabilities in global jets. In the\nelectron-proton jet simulation a modified recollimation occurs and jet\nelectrons are strongly perturbed. In the electron-positron jet simulation mixed\nkinetic instabilities occur at early times followed by a turbulence-like\nstructure. Simulations using much larger (and longer) systems are further\nrequired in order to thoroughly investigate the evolution of global jets\ncontaining helical magnetic fields.\n", "  We used the optical and near-infrared imagers located on the Liverpool, the\nIAC80, and the William Herschel telescopes to monitor 18 M7$-$L9.5 dwarfs with\nthe objective of measuring their rotation periods. We achieved accuracies\ntypically in the range $\\pm$1.5$-$28 mmag by means of differential photometry,\nwhich allowed us to detect photometric variability at the 2$\\sigma$ level in\nthe 50\\% of the sample. We also detected periodic modulation with periods in\nthe interval 1.5$-$4.4 h in 9 out of 18 dwarfs that we attribute to rotation.\nOur variability detections were combined with data from the literature; we\nfound that 65$\\,\\pm\\,$18 $\\%$ of M7$-$L3.5 dwarfs with $v\\,$sin$\\,i\\ge30$ km\ns$^{-1}$ exhibit photometric variability with typical amplitudes $\\le$20 mmag\nin the $I$-band. For those targets and field ultra-cool dwarfs with\nmeasurements of $v\\,$sin$\\,i$ and rotation period we derived the expected\ninclination angle of their rotation axis, and found that those with\n$v\\,$sin$\\,i\\ge30$ km s$^{-1}$ are more likely to have inclinations $\\gtrsim40$\ndeg. In addition, we used these rotation periods and others from the literature\nto study the likely relationship between rotation and linear polarization in\ndusty ultra-cool dwarfs. We found a correlation between short rotation periods\nand large values of linear polarization at optical and near-infrared\nwavelengths.\n", "  Recent studies have found a significant evolution and scatter in the\nIRX-$\\beta$ relation at z > 4, suggesting different dust properties of these\ngalaxies. The total far-infrared (FIR) luminosity is key for this analysis but\npoorly constrained in normal (main-sequence) star-forming z > 5 galaxies where\noften only one single FIR point is available. To better inform estimates of the\nFIR luminosity, we construct a sample of local galaxies and three low-redshift\nanalogs of z > 5 systems. The trends in this sample suggest that normal\nhigh-redshift galaxies have a warmer infrared (IR) SED compared to average z <\n4 galaxies that are used as prior in these studies. The blue-shifted peak and\nmid-IR excess emission could be explained by a combination of a larger fraction\nof the metal-poor inter-stellar medium (ISM) being optically thin to\nultra-violet (UV) light and a stronger UV radiation field due to high star\nformation densities. Assuming a maximally warm IR SED suggests 0.6 dex\nincreased total FIR luminosities, which removes some tension between dust\nattenuation models and observations of the IRX-$\\beta$ relation at z > 5.\nDespite this, some galaxies still fall below the minimum IRX-$\\beta$ relation\nderived with standard dust cloud models. We propose that radiation pressure in\nthese highly star-forming galaxies causes a spatial offset between dust clouds\nand young star-forming regions within the lifetime of O/B stars. These offsets\nchange the radiation balance and create viewing-angle effects that can change\nUV colors at fixed IRX. We provide a modified model that can explain the\nlocation of these galaxies on the IRX-$\\beta$ diagram.\n", "  We present a daytime thermal image of Europa taken with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array. The imaged region includes the area northwest of Pwyll\nCrater, which is associated with a nighttime thermal excess seen by the Galileo\nPhotopolarimeter Radiometer and with two potential plume detections. We develop\na global thermal model of Europa and simulate both the daytime and nighttime\nthermal emission to determine if the nighttime thermal anomaly is caused by\nexcess endogenic heat flow, as might be expected from a plume source region. We\nfind that the nighttime and daytime brightness temperatures near Pwyll Crater\ncannot be matched by including excess heat flow at that location. Rather, we\ncan successfully model both measurements by increasing the local thermal\ninertia of the surface.\n", "  We study universal critical adsorption on a solid sphere and a solid cylinder\nin a fluid at bulk criticality, where preferential adsorption occurs. We use a\nlocal functional theory proposed by Fisher, de Gennes, and Au-Yang ($[$C. R.\nAcad. Sci. Paris Ser. B {\\bf 287}, 207 (1978)$]$ and $[$Physica {\\bf 101}A, 255\n(1980)$]$). We calculate the mean order parameter profile $\\psi(r)$, where $r$\nis the distance from the sphere center and the cylinder axis, respectively. The\nresultant differential equation for $\\psi(r)$ is solved exactly around a sphere\nand numerically around a cylinder. A strong adsorption regime is realized\nexcept for very small surface field $h_1$, where the surface order parameter\n$\\psi(a)$ is determined by $h_1$ and is independent of the radius $a$. If $r$\nconsiderably exceeds $a$, $\\psi(r)$ decays as $r^{-(1+\\eta)} $ for a sphere and\n$r^{-(1+\\eta)/2} $ for a cylinder in three dimensions, where $\\eta$ is the\ncritical exponent in the order parameter correlation at bulk criticality.\n", "  We study how the viscosity of neutron star (NS) matter affects the\ndistribution of tilt angles ($\\chi$) between the spin and magnetic axes in\nyoung pulsars. Under the hypothesis that the NS shape is determined by the\nmagnetically-induced deformation, and that the toroidal component of the\ninternal magnetic field exceeds the poloidal one, we show that the dissipation\nof precessional motions by bulk viscosity can naturally produce a bi-modal\ndistribution of tilt angles, as observed in radio/$\\gamma$-ray pulsars, with a\nlow probability of achieving $\\chi \\sim (20^\\circ - 70^\\circ)$ if the interior\nB-field is $\\sim (10^{11} - 10^{15})$~G and the birth spin period is $\\sim 10 -\n300$~ms. As a corollary of the model, the idea that the NS shape is solely\ndetermined by the poloidal magnetic field, or by the centrifugal deformation of\nthe crust, is found to be inconsistent with the tilt angle distribution in\nyoung pulsars. When applied to the Crab pulsar, with $\\chi \\sim 45^\\circ -\n70^\\circ$ and birth spin $\\sim$ 20 ms, our model implies that: (i) the\nmagnetically-induced ellipticity is $\\epsilon_B \\gtrsim 3 \\times 10^{-6}$; (ii)\nthe measured positive $\\dot{\\chi} \\sim 3.6 \\times 10^{-12}$ rad s$^{-1}$\nrequires an additional viscous process, acting on a timescale $\\lesssim 10^4$\nyrs. We interpret the latter as crust-core coupling via mutual friction in the\nsuperfluid NS interior. One critical implication of our model is a GW signal at\n(twice) the spin frequency of the NS, due to $\\epsilon_B \\sim 10^{-6}$. This\ncould be detectable by Advanced LIGO/Virgo operating at design sensitivity.\n", "  The control of solute fluxes through either microscopic phoresis or\nhydrodynamic advection is a fundamental way to transport molecules, which are\nubiquitously present in nature and technology. We study the transport of large\nsolute such as DNA driven by a time-dependent thermal field in a polymer\nsolution. Heat propagation of a single heat spot moving back and forth gives\nrise to the molecular focusing of DNA with frequency-tunable control. We\ndeveloped a theoretical model, where heat conduction, viscoelastic expansion of\nwalls, and the viscosity gradient of a smaller solute are coupled, and that can\nexplain the underlying hydrodynamic focusing and its interplay with phoretic\ntransports. This cross effect may allow one to design a unique miniaturized\npump in microfluidics.\n", "  NGC 6229 is a relatively massive outer halo globular cluster that is\nprimarily known for exhibiting a peculiar bimodal horizontal branch morphology.\nGiven the paucity of spectroscopic data on this cluster, we present a detailed\nchemical composition analysis of 11 red giant branch members based on high\nresolution (R ~ 38,000), high S/N (> 100) spectra obtained with the\nMMT-Hectochelle instrument. We find the cluster to have a mean heliocentric\nradial velocity of -138.1$_{-1.0}^{+1.0}$ km s$^{\\rm -1}$, a small dispersion\nof 3.8$_{-0.7}^{+1.0}$ km s$^{\\rm -1}$, and a relatively low (M/L$_{\\rm\nV}$)$_{\\rm \\odot}$ = 0.82$_{-0.28}^{+0.49}$. The cluster is moderately\nmetal-poor with <[Fe/H]> = -1.13 dex and a modest dispersion of 0.06 dex.\nHowever, 18% (2/11) of the stars in our sample have strongly enhanced\n[La,Nd/Fe] ratios that are correlated with a small (~0.05 dex) increase in\n[Fe/H]. NGC 6229 shares several chemical signatures with M 75, NGC 1851, and\nthe intermediate metallicity populations of omega Cen, which lead us to\nconclude that NGC 6229 is a lower mass iron-complex cluster. The light elements\nexhibit the classical (anti-)correlations that extend up to Si, but the cluster\npossesses a large gap in the O-Na plane that separates first and second\ngeneration stars. NGC 6229 also has unusually low [Na,Al/Fe] abundances that\nare consistent with an accretion origin. A comparison with M 54 and other\nSagittarius clusters suggests that NGC 6229 could also be the remnant core of a\nformer dwarf spheroidal galaxy.\n", "  We study the van der Waals interaction of a metallic or narrow-gap\nsemiconducting nanowire with a surface, in the regime of intermediate\nwire-surface distances $(v_{F}/c)L \\ll d \\ll L $ or $L \\ll d \\ll (c/v_{F})L $,\nwhere $L$ is the nanowire length, $d$ is the distance to the surface, and\n$v_{F}$ is the characteristic velocity of nanowire electrons (for a metallic\nwire, it is the Fermi velocity). Our approach, based on the Luttinger liquid\nframework, allows one to analyze the dependence of the interaction on the\ninterplay between the nanowire length, wire-surface distance, and\ncharacteristic length scales related to the spectral gap and temperature. We\nshow that this interplay leads to nontrivial modifications of the power law\nthat governs van der Waals forces, in particular to a non-monotonic dependence\nof the power law exponent on the wire-surface separation.\n", "  The preheating of intergalactic medium(IGM) by structure collapsing and\nultraviolet background(UVB) are investigated in cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations. When gravitational collapsing is the sole heating mechanism, we\nfind that (1) $60\\%, 45\\%$ of the IGM are heated up to $S>8, 17$ kev cm$^2$\nrespectively at $z=0$, but the fractions drop rapidly to a few percents at\n$z=2$, (2) the entropy of the circum-halo gas $S_{\\rm{cir}}$ is higher than the\nvirial entropy for more than $75 \\%$ of the halos with masses $M<10^{11.5}$\n$M_{\\odot}$ since $z=2$, but the fraction higher than the entropy,\n$S_{\\rm{pr}}$, required in preventive model of galaxies formation is only\n$15-20 \\%$ for halos with $M<10^{10.5} M_{\\odot}$ at $z=0$, and decreases as\nredshift increases, (3)assuming a metallicity of $Z \\leq 0.03 Z_{\\odot}$, the\nfraction of halos whose circum-halo gas having a cooling time longer than the\nHubble time $t_{cool,cir}>t_{\\rm{H}}$ is merely $5-10 \\%$ at $z \\lesssim 0.5$,\nand even less at $z \\geq 1$ for halos with $M<10^{10.5} M_{\\odot}$. (4) gas in\nthe filaments undergoes the strongest preheating. Furthermore, we show that the\nUVB can not enhance the fraction of IGM with $S>17$ kev cm$^2$, but can\nincrease the fraction of low mass halos($<10^{10.5} M_{\\odot}$) that having\n$S_{\\rm{cir}}>S_{\\rm{pr}}$ to $\\sim 70 \\%$ at $z=0$, and that having\n$t_{\\rm{cool, cir}}>t_{\\rm{H}}$ to $15-30 \\%$ at $z \\lesssim 0.5$. Our results\nindicate that preheating due to gravitational collapsing and UVB are inadequate\nto fulfil the needs of preventative model, especially for halos with\n$10^{10.5}<M<10^{11.5} M_{\\odot}$. Nevertheless, these two mechanisms might\ncause large scale galactic conformity.\n", "  Previous studies revealed that electromagnetic cyclotron waves (ECWs) near\nthe proton cyclotron frequency exist widely in the solar wind, and the majority\nof ECWs are left-handed (LH) polarized waves. Using the magnetic field data\nfrom the STEREO mission, this Letter carries out a survey of ECWs over a long\nperiod of 7 years, and calculates the occurrence rates of ECWs with different\npolarization senses. Results show that the occurrence rate is nearly a constant\nfor the ECWs with right-handed polarization, but it varies significantly for\nthe ECWs with LH polarization. Further investigation of plasma conditions\nreveals that the LH ECWs take place preferentially in a plasma characterized by\nhigher temperature, lower density, and larger velocity. Some considerable\ncorrelations between the occurrence rate of LH ECWs and the properties of\nambient plasmas are discussed. The present research may provide evidence for\neffect of alpha particles on generation of ECWs.\n", "  Through a direct comparison of specific heat and magneto-resistance we\ncritically asses the nature of superconducting fluctuations in the same\nnano-gram crystal of SmFeAs(O, F). We show that although the superconducting\nfluctuation contribution to conductivity scales well within the 2D-LLL scheme\nits predictions contrast the inherently 3D nature of SmFeAs(O, F) in the\nvicinity T_{c}. Furthermore the transition seen in specific heat cannot be\nsatisfactory described either by the LLL or the XY scaling. Additionally we\nhave validated, through comparing Hc2 values obtained from the entropy\nconservation construction (Hab=-19.5 T/K and Hab=-2.9 T/K), the analysis of\nfluctuation contribution to conductivity as a reasonable method for estimating\nthe Hc2 slope.\n", "  A major uncertainty in the theory of stellar evolution is the angular\nmomentum distribution inside stars and its change during stellar life. We\ncompose a sample of 67 stars in the core-hydrogen burning phase with a\n$\\log\\,g$ value from high-resolution spectroscopy, as well as an asteroseismic\nestimate of the near-core rotation rate derived from gravity-mode oscillations\ndetected in space photometry. This assembly includes 8 B-type stars and 59\nAF-type stars, covering a mass range from 1.4 to 5\\,M$_\\odot$, i.e., it\nconcerns intermediate-mass stars born with a well-developed convective core.\nThe sample covers projected surface rotation velocities $v\\sin\\,i\n\\in[9,242]\\,$km\\,s$^{-1}$ and core rotation rates up to $26\\mu$Hz, which\ncorresponds to 50\\% of the critical rotation frequency. We find deviations from\nrigid rotation to be moderate in the single stars of this sample. We place the\nnear-core rotation rates in an evolutionary context and find that the core\nrotation must drop drastically before or during the short phase between the end\nof the core-hydrogen burning and the onset of core-helium burning. We compute\nthe spin parameter, which is the ratio of twice the rotation rate to the mode\nfrequency (also known as the inverse Rossby number), for 1682 gravity modes and\nfind the majority (95\\%) to occur in the sub-inertial regime. The ten stars\nwith Rossby modes have spin parameters between 14 and 30, while the\ngravito-inertial modes cover the range from 1 to 15.\n", "  New, updated, and/or revised CCD parallaxes determined with the Strand\nAstrometric Reflector at the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) are\npresented. Included are results for 309 late-type dwarf and subdwarf stars\nobserved over the 30+ years that the program operated. For 124 of the stars,\nparallax determinations from other investigators have already appeared in the\nliterature and we compare the different results. Also included here is new or\nupdated $VI$ photometry on the Johnson-Kron-Cousins system for all but a few of\nthe faintest targets. Together with 2MASS $JHK_s$ near-infrared photometry, a\nsample of absolute magnitude versus color and color versus color diagrams are\nconstructed. Since large proper motion was a prime criterion for targeting the\nstars, the majority turn out to be either M-type subdwarfs or late M-type\ndwarfs. The sample also includes 50 dwarf or subdwarf L-type stars, and four T\ndwarfs. Possible halo subdwarfs are identified in the sample based on\ntangential velocity, subluminosity, and spectral type. Residuals from the\nsolutions for parallax and proper motion for several stars show evidence of\nastrometric perturbations.\n", "  We use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Cu L$_3$ edge to\nmeasure the charge and spin excitations in the \"half-stuffed\" Cu--O planes of\nthe cuprate antiferromagnet Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$. The RIXS line shape\nreveals distinct contributions to the $dd$ excitations from the two\nstructurally inequivalent Cu sites, which have different out-of-plane\ncoordinations. The low-energy response exhibits magnetic excitations. We find a\nspin-wave branch whose dispersion follows the symmetry of a CuO$_2$ sublattice,\nsimilar to the case of the \"fully-stuffed\" planes of tetragonal CuO (T-CuO).\nIts bandwidth is closer to that of a typical cuprate material, such as\nSr$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$, than it is to that of T-CuO. We interpret this result as\narising from the absence of the effective four-spin inter-sublattice\ninteractions that act to reduce the bandwidth in T-CuO.\n", "  We present [Fe/H] and [Ca/Fe] of $\\sim600$ red giant branch (RGB) members of\nthe globular cluster $\\omega$ Centauri. We collect medium-resolution\n($R\\sim2000$) spectra using the Blanco 4 m telescope at the Cerro Tololo\nInter-American Observatory equipped with Hydra, the fiber-fed multi-object\nspectrograph. We demonstrate that blending of stellar light in optical fibers\nseverely limits the accuracy of spectroscopic parameters in the crowded central\nregion of the cluster. When photometric temperatures are taken in the\nspectroscopic analysis, our kinematically selected cluster members, excluding\nthose that are strongly affected by flux from neighboring stars, include\nrelatively fewer stars at intermediate metallicity ([Fe/H]$\\sim-1.5$) than seen\nin the previous high-resolution survey for brighter giants in Johnson &\nPilachowski. As opposed to the trend of increasing [Ca/Fe] with [Fe/H] found by\nthose authors, our [Ca/Fe] estimates, based on Ca II H & K measurements, show\nessentially the same mean [Ca/Fe] for most of the metal-poor and\nmetal-intermediate populations in this cluster, suggesting that mass- or\nmetallicity-dependent SN II yields may not be necessary in their proposed\nchemical evolution scenario. Metal-rich cluster members in our sample show a\nlarge spread in [Ca/Fe], and do not exhibit a clear bimodal distribution in\n[Ca/Fe]. We also do not find convincing evidence for a radial metallicity\ngradient among RGB stars in $\\omega$ Centauri.\n", "  Valley pseudospin, labeling quantum states of energy extrema in momentum\nspace, is attracting tremendous attention1-13 because of its potential in\nconstructing new carrier of information. Compared with the non-topological bulk\nvalley transport realized soon after predictions1-5, the topological valley\ntransport in domain walls6-13 is extremely challenging owing to the\ninter-valley scattering inevitably induced by atomic scale imperfectness, until\nthe recent electronic signature observed in bilayer graphene12,13. Here we\nreport the first experimental observation of topological valley transport of\nsound in sonic crystals. The macroscopic nature of sonic crystals permits the\nflexible and accurate design of domain walls. In addition to a direct\nvisualization of the valley-selective edge modes through spatial scanning of\nsound field, reflection immunity is observed in sharply curved interfaces. The\ntopologically protected interface transport of sound, strikingly different from\nthat in traditional sound waveguides14,15, may serve as the basis of designing\ndevices with unconventional functions.\n", "  The HST archive contains a large collection of images of eta Carinae, and\nthis paper analyzes those most suitable for measuring its expanding Homunculus\nNebula. Multiple intensity tracings through the Homunculus reveal the\nfractional increase in the overall size of the nebula; this avoids registration\nuncertainty, mitigates brightness fluctuations, and is independent of previous\nmethods. Combining a 13-yr baseline of Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2)\nimages in the F631N filter, with a 4-yr baseline of Advanced Camera for\nSurveys/High Resolution Channel (ACS/HRC) images in the F550M filter, yields an\nejection date (assuming linear motion) of 1847.1 ($\\pm$0.8 yr). This result\nimproves the precision, but is in excellent agreement with the previous study\nby Morse et al.\\ (2001) that used a shorter time baseline and a different\nanalysis method. This more precise date is inconsistent with ejection during a\nperiastron passage of the eccentric binary. Ejection occured well into the main\nplateau of the Great Eruption, and not during the brief peaks in 1843 and 1838.\nThe age uncertainty is dominated by a real spread in ages of various knots, and\nby some irregular brightness fluctuations. Several knots appear to have been\nejected decades before or after the mean date, implying a complicated history\nof mass-loss episodes outside the main bright phase of the eruption. The\nextended history of mass ejection may have been largely erased by the passage\nof a shock through clumpy ejecta, as most material was swept into a thin shell\nwith nearly uniform apparent age.\n", "  The new generations of multiwavelength radioheliographs with high spatial\nresolution will employ microwave imaging spectropolarimetry to recover flare\ntopology and plasma parameters in the flare sources and along the wave\npropagation paths. The recorded polarization depends on the emission mechanism\nand emission regime (optically thick or thin), the emitting particle\nproperties, and propagation effects. Here, we report an unusual flare,\nSOL2012-07-06T01:37, whose optically thin gyrosynchrotron emission of the main\nsource displays an apparently ordinary mode sense of polarization in contrast\nto the classical theory that favors the extraordinary mode. This flare produced\ncopious nonthermal emission in hard X-rays and in high-frequency microwaves up\nto 80 GHz. It is found that the main flare source corresponds to an interaction\nsite of two loops with greatly different sizes. We have investigated the three\npossible known reasons of the circular polarization sense reversal - mode\ncoupling, positron contribution, and the effect of beamed angular distribution.\nWe excluded polarization reversal due to contribution of positrons because\nthere was no relevant response in the X-ray emission. We find that a beam-like\nelectron distribution can produce the observed polarization behavior, but the\nsource thermal density must be much higher than the estimate from to the X-ray\ndata. We conclude that the apparent ordinary wave emission in the optically\nthin mode is due to radio wave propagation across the quasi-transverse (QT)\nlayer. The abnormally high transition frequency (above 35 GHz) can be achieved\nreasonably low in the corona where the magnetic field value is high and\ntransverse to the line of sight. This places the microwave source below this QT\nlayer, i.e. very low in the corona.\n", "  The scalar mode temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background\nhas been derived in a spatially closed universe from two different methods.\nFirst, by following the photon trajectory after the last scattering and then\nfrom the Boltzmann equation in a closed background and the line of sight\nintegral method. An analytic expression for the temperature multipole\ncoefficient has been extracted at the hydrodynamical limit, where we have\nconsidered some tolerable approximations. By considering a realistic set of\ncosmological parameters taken from a fit to data from Planck, the TT power\nspectrum in the scalar mode for the closed universe has been compared with\nnumerical one by using the CAMB code and also latest observational data. The\nanalytic result agrees with the numerical one on almost all scales. The peak\npositions are in very good agreement with numerical result while the peak\nheights agree with that to within 10% due to the approximations have been\nconsidered for this derivation.\n", "  Pulsed-laser dry printing of noble-metal microrings with a tunable internal\nporous structure, which can be revealed via an ion-beam etching post-procedure,\nwas demonstrated. Abundance and average size of the pores inside the microrings\nwere shown to be tuned in a wide range by varying incident pulse energy and a\nnitrogen doping level controlled in the process of magnetron deposition of the\ngold film in the appropriate gaseous environment. The fabricated porous\nmicrorings were shown to provide many-fold near-field enhancement of incident\nelectromagnetic fields, which was confirmed by mapping of the characteristic\nRaman band of a nanometer-thick covering layer of Rhodamine 6G dye molecules\nand supporting finite-difference time-domain calculations. The proposed laser\nprinting/ion-beam etching approach is demonstrated to be a unique tool aimed at\ndesigning and fabricating multifunctional plasmonic structures and metasurfaces\nfor spectroscopic bioidentification based on surface-enhanced infrared\nabsorption, Raman scattering and photoluminescence detection schemes.\n", "  This article briefly reviews our current understanding of the evolution of\nmagnetic fields in neutron stars, which basically defines the evolutionary\npathways between different observational classes of neutron stars. The emphasis\nhere is on the evolution in binary systems and the newly emergent classes of\nmillisecond pulsars.\n", "  The pulsar radio emission originates from regions below 10% of the light\ncylinder radius. This requires a mechanism where coherent emission is excited\nin relativistic pair plasma with frequency $\\nu_{cr}$ which is below the plasma\nfrequency $\\nu_{\\circ}$ i.e. $\\nu_{cr} < \\nu_{\\circ}$. A possible model for the\nemission mechanism is charged bunches (charged solitons) moving\nrelativistically along the curved open dipolar magnetic field lines capable of\nexciting coherent curvature radio emission. In this article we review the\nresults from high quality observations in conjunction with theoretical models\nto unravel the nature of coherent curvature radio emission in pulsars.\n", "  We discuss different exotic phases and components of matter from the crust to\nthe core of neutron stars based on theoretical models for equations of state\nrelevant to core collapse supernova simulations and neutron star merger.\nParameters of the models are constrained from laboratory experiments. It is\nobserved that equations of state involving strangeness degrees of freedom such\nas hyperons and Bose-Einstein condensates are compatible with 2M$_{solar}$\nneutron stars. The role of hyperons is explored on the evolution and stability\nof the protoneutron star (PNS) in the context of SN1987A. Moment of inertia,\nmass and radius which are direct probes of neutron star interior are computed\nand their observational consequences are discussed. We continue our study on\nthe dense matter under strong magnetic fields and its application to\nmagnetoelastic oscillations of neutron stars.\n", "  The CO(J=3-2) emission from the CSE of the binary S-type AGB star W Aql has\nbeen observed at subarcsecond resolution using ALMA. The aim of this paper is\nto investigate the wind properties of the AGB star and to analyse how the known\ncompanion has shaped the CSE. The average mass-loss rate during the creation of\nthe detected CSE is estimated through modelling, using the ALMA brightness\ndistribution and previously published single-dish measurements as observational\nconstraints. The ALMA observations are presented and compared to the results\nfrom a 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) binary interaction model with\nthe same properties as the W Aql system and with two different orbital\neccentricities. Three-dimensional radiative transfer modelling is performed and\nthe response of the interferometer is modelled and discussed. The estimated\naverage mass-loss rate of W~Aql agrees with previous results. The size of the\nemitting region is consistent with photodissociation models. The CO(J=3-2)\nemission is dominated by a smooth component overlayed with two weak arc\npatterns with different separations. The larger pattern is predicted by the\nbinary interaction model with separations of 10\" and therefore likely due to\nthe known companion. It is consistent with a binary orbit with low\neccentricity. The smaller separation pattern is asymmetric and coincides with\nthe dust distribution, but the separation timescale (200 yrs) is not consistent\nwith any known process of the system. The separation of the known companions of\nthe system is large enough to not have a very strong effect on the\ncircumstellar morphology. The density contrast across the envelope of a binary\nwith an even larger separation will not be easily detectable, even with ALMA,\nunless the orbit is strongly asymmetric or the AGB star has a much larger\nmass-loss rate.\n", "  The magnetospheres around neutron stars should be very particular because of\ntheir strong magnetic field and rapid rotation. A study of the pulsar\nmagnetospheres is of a crucial importance since it is the key issue to\nunderstand how energy inflow to the exterior is produced. In this paper, I\ndiscuss magnetohydrodynamic processes in the pulsar magnetosphere. I consider\nin detail the properties of magnetohydrodynamic waves that can exist in the\nmagnetosphere and their instabilities.These instabilities lead to formation of\nmagnetic structures and can be responsible for a short-term variability ofthe\npulsar emission.\n", "  We take a fresh look at the determination of distances and velocities of\nneutron stars. The conversion of a parallax measurement into a distance, or\ndistance probability distribution, has led to a debate quite similar to the one\ninvolving Cepheids, centering on the question whether priors can be used when\ndiscussing a single system. With the example of PSRJ0218+4232 we show that a\nprior is necessary to determine the probability distribution for the distance.\nThe distance of this pulsar implies a gamma-ray luminosity larger than 10% of\nits spindown luminosity. For velocities the debate is whether a single\nMaxwellian describes the distribution for young pulsars. By limiting our\ndiscussion to accurate (VLBI) measurements we argue that a description with two\nMaxwellians, with distribution parameters sigma1=77 and sigma2=320 km/s, is\nsignificantly better. Corrections for galactic rotation, to derive velocities\nwith respect to the local standards of rest, are insignificant.\n", "  In this year, in which we celebrate 100 years of the cosmological term,\n$\\Lambda$, in Einstein's gravitational field equations, we are still facing the\ncrucial question whether $\\Lambda$ is truly a fundamental constant or a mildly\nevolving dynamical variable. After many theoretical attempts to understand the\nmeaning of $\\Lambda$, and in view of the enhanced accuracy of the cosmological\nobservations, it seems now mandatory that this issue should be first settled\nempirically before further theoretical speculations on its ultimate nature. In\nthis work, we summarize the situation of some of these studies. Devoted\nanalyses made recently show that the $\\Lambda=$const. hypothesis, despite being\nthe simplest, may well not be the most favored one. The overall fit to the\ncosmological observables $SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+CMB$ singles out the class RVM of\nthe \"running\" vacuum models, in which $\\Lambda=\\Lambda(H)$ is an affine\npower-law function of the Hubble rate. It turns out that the performance of the\nRVM as compared to the \"concordance\" $\\Lambda$CDM model (with $\\Lambda=$const.)\nis much better. The evidence in support of the RVM may reach $\\sim 4\\sigma$\nc.l., and is bolstered with Akaike and Bayesian criteria providing strong\nevidence in favor of the RVM option. We also address the implications of this\nframework on the tension between the CMB and local measurements of the current\nHubble parameter.\n", "  The 1982 model for the formation of the Hulse-Taylor binary radio pulsar PSR\nB1913+16 is described, which since has become the standard model for the\nformation of double neutron stars, confirmed by the 2003 discovery of the\ndouble pulsar system PSR J0737-3039AB. A brief overview is given of the present\nstatus of our knowledge of the double neutron stars, of which 15 systems are\npresently known. The binary-recycling model for the formation of millisecond\npulsars is described, as put forward independently by Alpar et al. (1982),\nRadhakrishnan and Srinivasan (1982) and Fabian et al. (1983). This now is the\nstandard model for the formation of these objects, confirmed by the discovery\nin 1998 of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars. It is noticed that the\nformation process of close double black holes has analogies to that of close\ndouble neutron stars, extended to binaries of larger iinitial component masses,\nalthough there are also considerable differences in the physics of the binary\nevolution at these larger masses.\n", "  In this work, we use Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) introduced as a\ngeneric modification to particle dispersion relations to study some\nconsequences of single photon emission, known as vacuum Cherenkov radiation,\nand photon decay processes in cosmic and gamma rays. These processes are\nforbidden in a Lorentz invariant theory but allowed under the hypothesis of\nLIV. We show that the emission rate have a dependency on the cosmic ray primary\nmass and the electric charge that could modify the UHECR spectrum. Furthermore,\nLIV dramatically enhances photon decay into an electro-positron pair above\ncertain energy threshold. This last effect can then be used to set limits to\nthe LIV energy scale from the direct observation of very high energy cosmic\nphoton events by telescopes of gamma-rays.\n", "  We show that mid-infrared data from the all-sky WISE survey can be used as a\nrobust photometric redshift indicator for powerful radio AGN, in the absence of\nother spectroscopic or multi-band photometric information. Our work is\nmotivated by a desire to extend the well-known K-z relation for radio galaxies\nto the wavelength range covered by the all-sky WISE mid-infrared survey. Using\nthe LARGESS radio spectroscopic sample as a training set, and the mid-infrared\ncolour information to classify radio sources, we generate a set of redshift\nprobability distributions for the hosts of high-excitation and low-excitation\nradio AGN. We test the method using spectroscopic data from several other radio\nAGN studies, and find good agreement between our WISE-based redshift estimates\nand published spectroscopic redshifts out to z ~ 1 for galaxies and z ~ 3-4 for\nradio-loud QSOs. Our chosen method is also compared against other\nclassification methods and found to perform reliably. This technique is likely\nto be particularly useful in the analysis of upcoming large-area radio surveys\nwith SKA pathfinder telescopes, and our code is publicly available. As a\nconsistency check, we show that our WISE-based redshift estimates for sources\nin the 843 MHz SUMSS survey reproduce the redshift distribution seen in the\nCENSORS study up to z ~ 2. We also discuss two specific applications of our\ntechnique for current and upcoming radio surveys; an interpretation of large\nscale HI absorption surveys, and a determination of whether low-frequency\npeaked spectrum sources lie at high redshift.\n", "  Recent advances in compressed sensing theory and algorithms offer new\npossibilities for high-speed X-ray camera design. In many CMOS cameras, each\npixel has an independent on-board circuit that includes an amplifier, noise\nrejection, signal shaper, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and optional\nin-pixel storage. When X-ray images are sparse, i.e., when one of the following\ncases is true: (a.) The number of pixels with true X-ray hits is much smaller\nthan the total number of pixels; (b.) The X-ray information is redundant; or\n(c.) Some prior knowledge about the X-ray images exists, sparse sampling may be\nallowed. Here we first illustrate the feasibility of random on-board pixel\nsampling (ROPS) using an existing set of X-ray images, followed by a discussion\nabout signal to noise as a function of pixel size. Next, we describe a possible\ncircuit architecture to achieve random pixel access and in-pixel storage. The\ncombination of a multilayer architecture, sparse on-chip sampling, and\ncomputational image techniques, is expected to facilitate the development and\napplications of high-speed X-ray camera technology.\n", "  In the framework of Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory\n(EFT), we calculate two-gluon rapidity correlations in the leading and\nsub-leading orders of $p_\\perp/Q_s$. In the leading order, both short- and\nlong-range rapidity correlations are enhanced. In contrast, the contribution of\nsub-leading order is mainly short range quantum correlations. It is much\nsmaller than that of the leading one, but is not negligible. Transverse\nmomentum dependence of rapidity correlation shows that the leading order is\nsensitive to the saturation momentum of two incident particles, but the\nsub-leading one is not.\n", "  All-optical spin reversal presents a new opportunity for spin manipulations,\nfree of a magnetic field. Most of all-optical-spin-reversal ferromagnets are\nfound to have a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), but it has been\nunknown whether PMA is necessary for the spin reversal. Here we theoretically\ninvestigate magnetic thin films with either PMA or in-plane magnetic anisotropy\n(IMA). Our results show that the spin reversal in IMA systems is possible, but\nonly with a longer laser pulse and within a narrow laser parameter region. The\nspin reversal does not show a strong helicity dependence where the left- and\nright-circularly polarized light lead to the identical results. By contrast,\nthe spin reversal in PMA systems is robust, provided both the spin angular\nmomentum and laser field are strong enough while the magnetic anisotropy itself\nis not too strong. This explains why experimentally the majority of all-optical\nspin-reversal samples are found to have strong PMA and why spins in Fe\nnanoparticles only cant out of plane. It is the laser-induced spin-orbit torque\nthat plays a key role in the spin reversal. Surprisingly, the same spin-orbit\ntorque results in laser-induced spin rectification in spin-mixed configuration,\na prediction that can be tested experimentally. Our results clearly point out\nthat PMA is essential to the spin reversal, though there is an opportunity for\nin-plane spin reversal.\n", "  The Minimal Dark Matter framework classifies viable Dark Matter (DM)\ncandidates that are obtained by simply augmenting the Standard Model of\nparticle interactions with a new multiplet, without adding new ad hoc\nsymmetries to make the DM stable. The model has no free parameters and is\ntherefore extremely predictive; moreover, recent studies singled out a Majorana\n$SU(2)_\\text{L}$ quintuplet as the only viable candidate. The model can be\nconstrained by both direct and indirect DM searches, with present time\ngamma-ray line searches in the Galactic Center being particularly sensitive. It\nis therefore timely to critically review this paradigm and point out possible\ngeneralizations. We propose and explore two distinct directions. One is to\nlower the cutoff of the model, which was originally fixed at the Planck scale,\nto allow for decays of the DM quintuplet. We analyze the decay spectrum of this\ncandidate in detail and show that gamma-ray data constrain the cutoff to lie\nabove the GUT scale. Another possibility is to abandon the assumption of DM\nelectric neutrality in favor of absolutely stable, millicharged DM candidates.\nWe explicitly study a few examples, and find that a Dirac $SU(2)_\\text{L}$\ntriplet is the candidate least constrained by indirect searches.\n", "  A neutral dark matter (DM) particle with a magnetic dipole moment has a very\ndifferent direct detection phenomenology with respect to standard candidates.\nThis is due to the peculiar functional form of the differential cross section\nfor scattering with nuclei. Such a candidate could be a bound state of charged\nparticles, as the neutron or an atom, or a fundamental particle coupled to\nheavier charged states, much like a Dirac neutrino. We analyze here the direct\ndetection signals of DM with magnetic dipole moment, both the recoil rate and\nits modulation, and show that they are very different from those expected in\nstandard scenarios. For this candidate, contrary to the common lore, the time\nof maximum signal depends on the recoil energy as well as on the target\nmaterial. The observation of different modulations by experiments employing\ndifferent targets would be a strong indication in favor of this type of DM\nparticles.\n", "  The polarization of light can exhibit unusual features when singular optical\nbeams are involved. In 3-dimensional polarized random media the polarization\norientation around singularities describe 1/2 or 3/2 M\\\"obius strips. It has\nbeen predicted that if singular beams intersect non-collinearly in free space,\nthe polarization ellipse rotates forming many-turn M\\\"obius strips or twisted\nribbons along closed loops around a central singularity. These polarization\nfeatures are important because polarization is an aspect of light that mediate\nstrong interactions with matter, with potential for new applications. We\nexamined the non-collinear superposition of two unfocused paraxial light beams\nwhen one of them carried an optical vortex and the other one a uniform phase\nfront, both in orthogonal states of circular polarization. It is known that\nthese superpositions in 2-dimensions produce space-variant patterns of\npolarization. Relying on the symmetry of the problem, we extracted the\n3-dimensional patterns from projective measurements, and confirmed the\nformation of many-turn M\\\"obius strips or twisted ribbons when the topological\ncharge of one of the component beams was odd or even, respectively. The\nmeasurements agree well with the modelings and confirmed that these types of\npatterns occur at macroscopic length scales and in ordinary superposition\nsituations.\n", "  In this article we will build a universal imbedding of a regular Hom- Lie\ntriple system into a Lie algebra and show that the category of regular Hom-Lie\ntriple systems is equivalent to a full subcategory of pairs of\n$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$- graded Lie algebras and Lie algebra automorphism,\nthen finally give some characterizations of this subcategory.\n", "  The response to shear of the dense soft solids features a stress overshoot\nand a persistent shear banding before reaching a homogeneously flowing state.\nIn 3D large scale simulations we analyze the time required for the onset of\nhomogeneous flow, the normal stresses and structural signatures at different\nshear rates and in different flow geometries, finding that the stress\novershoot, the shear band formation and its persistence are controlled by the\npresence of overconstrained microscopic domains in the initially solid samples.\nBeing able to identify such domains in our model by prevalently icosahedrally\npacked regions, we show that they allow for stress accumulation during the\nstress overshoot and that their structural reorganization controls the\nemergence and the persistence of the shear banding.\n", "  A~machine learning framework is developed to estimate ocean-wave conditions.\nBy supervised training of machine learning models on many thousands of\niterations of a physics-based wave model, accurate representations of\nsignificant wave heights and period can be used to predict ocean conditions. A\nmodel of Monterey Bay was used as the example test site; it was forced by\nmeasured wave conditions, ocean-current nowcasts, and reported winds. These\ninput data along with model outputs of spatially variable wave heights and\ncharacteristic period were aggregated into supervised learning training and\ntest data sets, which were supplied to machine learning models. These machine\nlearning models replicated wave heights with a root-mean-squared error of 9cm\nand correctly identify over 90% of the characteristic periods for the test-data\nsets. Impressively, transforming model inputs to outputs through matrix\noperations requires only a fraction (<1/1,000) of the computation time compared\nto forecasting with the physics-based model.\n", "  We describe the POLAMI program for the monitoring of all four Stokes\nparameters of a sample of bright radio-loud active galactic nuclei with the\nIRAM 30m telescope at 3.5 and 1.3mm. The program started in October 2006 and\naccumulated, until August 2014, 2300 observations at 3.5mm, achieving a median\ntime sampling interval of 22 days for the sample of 37 sources. This first\npaper explains the source selection, mostly blazars, the observing strategy and\ndata calibration, and gives the details of the instrumental polarisation\ncorrections. The sensitivity (1sigma) reached at 3.5mm is 0.5% (linear\npolarisation degree), 4.7 deg. (polarisation angle), and 0.23% (circular\npolarisation), while the corresponding values at 1.3mm are 1.7%, 9.9 deg., and\n0.72%, respectively. The data quality is demonstrated by the time sequences of\nour calibrators Mars and Uranus. For the quasar 3C286, widely used as a linear\npolarisation calibrator, we give improved estimates of its linear polarisation,\nand show for the first time occasional detections of its weak circular\npolarisation, which suggests a small level of variability of the source at\nmillimeter wavelengths.\n", "  We analyse the circular polarisation data accumulated in the first 7 years of\nthe POLAMI project introduced in an accompanying paper (Agudo et al.). In the\n3mm wavelength band, we acquired more than 2600 observations, and all but one\nof our 37 sample sources were detected, most of them several times. For most\nsources, the observed distribution of the degree of circular polarisation is\nbroader than that of unpolarised calibrators, indicating that weak (<0.5%)\ncircular polarisation is present most of the time. Our detection rate and the\nmaximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,\nall made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month. Longer time scales of about\none year are occasionally detected, but severely limited by the weakness of the\nsignal. At variance with some longer wavelength investigations we find that the\nsign of circular polarisation changes in most sources, while only 7 sources,\nincluding 3 already known, have a strong preference for one sign. The degrees\nof circular and linear polarisation do not show any systematic correlation. We\ndo find however one particular event where the two polarisation degrees vary in\nsynchronism during a time span of 0.9 years. The paper also describes a novel\nmethod for calibrating the sign of circular polarisation observations.\n", "  We report on the first results of the POLAMI program, a simultaneous 3.5 and\n1.3mm full-Stokes-polarisation monitoring of a sample of 36 of the brightest\nactive galactic nuclei in the northern sky with the IRAM 30m Telescope. Through\na systematic statistical study of data taken from October 2006 (from December\n2009 for the case of the 1.3mm observations) to August 2014, we characterise\nthe variability of the total flux density and linear polarisation. We find that\nall sources in the sample are highly variable in total flux density at both 3.5\nand 1.3mm, as well as in spectral index, that is found to be optically thin in\ngeneral. The total flux-density variability at 1.3mm is found, in general, to\nbe faster, and to have larger amplitude and flatter PSD slopes than 3.5mm. The\npolarisation degree is on average larger at 1.3mm than at 3.5mm, by a factor of\n2.6. The variability of linear polarisation degree is faster and has higher\nfractional amplitude than for total flux density, with the typical time scales\nduring prominent polarisation peaks being significantly faster at 1.3mm than at\n3.5mm. The polarisation angle at both 3.5 and 1.3mm is highly variable. Most of\nthe sources show one or two excursions of >180 deg. on time scales from a few\nweeks to about a year during the course of our observations. The 3.5 and 1.3mm\npolarisation angle evolution follow rather well each other, although the 1.3mm\ndata show a clear preference to more prominent variability on the short time\nscales, i.e. weeks. The data are compatible with multi-zone models of conical\njets involving smaller emission regions for the shortest-wavelength emitting\nsites. Such smaller emitting regions should also be more efficient in\nenergising particle populations. The data also favours the integrated emission\nat 1.3mm to have better ordered magnetic fields than the one at 3.5mm.\n", "  This paper presents theoretical analysis of a MEMS electrostatic energy\nharvester configured as the Bennet's doubler. Steady-state operation of the\ndoubler circuit can be approximated by a right-angled trapezoid Q-V cycle. A\nsimilarity between voltage doubler and resistive-based charge-pump circuit is\nhighlighted. By taking electromechanical coupling into account, the analytical\nsolution of the saturation voltage is the first time derived, providing a\ngreater comprehension of the system performance and multi-parameter effects.\nThe theoretical approach is verified by results of circuit simulation for two\ncases of mathematically idealized diode and of Schottky diode. Development of\nthe doubler/multiplier circuits that can further increase the saturation\nvoltage is investigated.\n", "  This paper presents the analysis of an efficient alternative interface\ncircuit for MEMS electrostatic energy harvesters. It is entirely composed by\ndiodes and capacitors. Based on modeling and simulation, the anti-phase\ngap-closing structure is investigated. We find that when configured as a\nvoltage multiplier, it can operate at very low acceleration amplitudes. In\naddition, the allowed maximum voltage between electrodes is barely limited by\nthe pull-in effect. The parasitic capacitance of the harvester and non-ideal\ncharacteristics of electronic components are taken into account. A lumped-model\nof the harvesting system has been implemented in a circuit simulator.\nSimulation results show that an output voltage of 22 V is obtained with 0.15 g\ninput acceleration. The minimum necessary ratio between the maximum and minimum\ncapacitances of the generators which allows operation of the circuit, can be\nlower than 2. This overcomes a crucial obstacle in low-power energy harvesting\ndevices. A comparison between the voltage multiplier against other current\ntopologies is highlighted. An advantage of the former over the latter is to\ngenerate much higher saturation voltage, while the minimum required initial\nbias and the minimum capacitance ratio in both cases are in the similar levels.\n", "  This paper investigates the lateral pull-in effect of an in-plane\noverlap-varying transducer. The instability is induced by the translational and\nrotational displacements. Based on the principle of virtual work, the\nequilibrium conditions of force and moment in lateral directions are derived.\nThe analytical solutions of the critical voltage, at which the pull-in\nphenomenon occurs, are developed when considering only the translational\nstiffness or only the rotational stiffness of the mechanical spring. The\ncritical voltage in general case is numerically determined by using nonlinear\noptimization techniques, taking into account the combined effect of translation\nand rotation. The effects of possible translational offsets and angular\ndeviations to the critical voltage are modeled and numerically analyzed. The\ninvestigation is then the first time expanded to anti-phase operation mode and\nBennet's doubler configuration of the two transducers.\n", "  We report nanoscale bandgap engineering via a local strain across the\ninhomogeneous ferroelectric interface, which is controlled by the\nvisible-light-excited probe voltage. Switchable photovolatic effects and the\nspectral response of the photocurrent were explore to illustrate the reversible\nbandgap variation (~0.3eV). This local-strain-engineered bandgap has been\nfurther revealed by in situ probe-voltage-assisted valence electron energy-loss\nspectroscopy (EELS). Phase-field simulations and first-principle calculations\nwere also employed for illustration of the large local strain and the bandgap\nvariation in ferroelectric perovskite oxides. This reversible bandgap tuning in\ncomplex oxides demonstrates a framework for the understanding of the\nopticallyrelated behaviors (photovoltaic, photoemission, and photocatalyst\neffects) affected by order parameters such as charge, orbital, and lattice\nparameters.\n", "  We report the successful growth of tetragonal FeS film with one or two\nunit-cell (UC) thickness on SrTiO3(001) substrate by molecular beam epitaxy.\nLarge lattice constant mismatch with the substrate leads to high density of\ndefects in single UC FeS, while it has been significantly reduced in double UC\nthick film due to the lattice relaxation. The scanning tunneling spectra on the\nsurface of FeS thin film reveal the electronic doping effect of single UC FeS\nfrom the substrate. In addition, at the Fermi level, the energy gaps of\napproximate 1.5 meV are observed in films of both thicknesses at 4.6 K and\nbelow. The absence of coherence peaks of gap spectra may be related to the\npreformed Cooper-pairs without phase coherence.\n", "  We study the ${}^{1}S_0$ proton pairing gap in beta-equilibrated neutron star\nmatter within the framework of chiral effective field theory. We focus on the\nrole of three-body forces, which strongly modify the effective proton-proton\nspin-singlet interaction in dense matter. We find that three-body forces\ngenerically reduce both the size of the pairing gap and the maximum density at\nwhich proton pairing may occur. The pairing gap is computed within BCS theory,\nand model uncertainties are estimated by varying the nuclear potential and the\nchoice of single-particle spectrum in the gap equation. We find that a\nsecond-order perturbative treatment of the single-particle spectrum suppresses\nthe proton ${}^{1}S_0$ pairing gap relative to the use of a free spectrum. We\nestimate the critical temperature for the onset of proton superconductivity to\nbe $T_c = (3.7 - 6.0)\\times 10^{9} $ K, which is consistent with previous\ntheoretical results in the literature and marginally within the range deduced\nfrom a recent Bayesian analysis of neutron star cooling observations.\n", "  The study of nanostructured artificial media for optics has expanded rapidly\nover the last few decades, coupled with improvements of fabrication technology\nthat have enabled investigation of previously unrealisable optical scattering\nsystems. Such development is complemented by renewed impetus to understand the\nphysics of optical scattering from complex subwavelength geometry and\nnanoparticle systems. Here I investigate specifically the optical properties of\nclosely packed arrangements of nanoparticles, known as nanoparticle oligomers,\nwhich provide an intuitive platform for analytical and numerical study on the\nformation and interplay of collective resonances. I consider both plasmonic\nnanoparticles, and also high-refractive-index dielectric nanoparticles that\nsupport Mie-type electric and magnetic dipole resonances. Specific outcomes of\nthis study are listed as follows. (i) A new model is presented for optical Fano\nresonances, which is based on interference between nonorthogonal eigenmodes of\nthe associated scattering object. This is demonstrated to correctly describe\nFano resonances in both plasmonic and high-refractive-index dielectric\nnanoparticle oligomers. (ii) Polarisation-independent scattering and absorption\nlosses are shown to be enforced by n-fold discrete rotational symmetry, Cn (n\n\\geq 3), and the reciprocal degeneracy of eigenmodes. (iii) A form of circular\ndichroism that emerges from interaction of nonorthogonal resonances is\npresented, and specifically impacts the ratio of radiative scattering loss to\ndissipative absorption loss experienced by reciprocal plane waves. The sequence\nof general theoretical conclusions (i)-(iii) serve to build the understanding\nof optical scattering from nanoparticle systems while removing existing\nambiguities.\n", "  In wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) schemes, splitters must be used to\ncombine and separate different wavelengths. Conventional splitters are fairly\nlarge with footprints in hundreds to thousands of square microns, and\nexperimentally-demonstrated MMI-based and inverse-designed ultra-compact\nsplitters operate with only two channels and large channel spacing ($>$100 nm).\nHere we inverse design and experimentally demonstrate a three-channel\nwavelength demultiplexer with 40 nm spacing (1500 nm, 1540 nm, and 1580 nm)\nwith a footprint of 24.75 $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$. The splitter has a simulated peak\ninsertion loss of -1.55 dB with under -15 dB crosstalk and a measured peak\ninsertion loss of -2.29 dB with under -10.7 dB crosstalk.\n", "  A highly sensitive refractive index sensor based on grating-assisted strip\nwaveguide directional coupler is proposed. The sensor is designed using two\ncoupled asymmetric strip waveguides with a top-loaded grating structure in one\nof the waveguides. Maximum light couples from one waveguide to the other at the\nresonance wavelength, and the change in resonance wavelength with the change in\nrefractive index of the medium in the cover region is a measure of the\nsensitivity. The proposed sensor would be an on-chip device with a high\nrefractive index sensitivity of ~ 104 nm/RIU, and negligible temperature\nsensitivity (< 1nm/0C). The sensor configuration offers a low propagation loss,\nthereby enhancing the sensitivity. Variation of the sensitivity with the\nwaveguide parameters of the proposed sensor have been studied to optimize the\ndesign.\n", "  We report a silicon nitride RF photonic notch filter with unprecedented\nperformance including 8 dB of RF gain, record-low noise figure of 15.6 dB, and\nspurious-free dynamic range of 116 dB while achieving an ultra-deep rejection\nof beyond 50 dB in the stopbands.\n", "  Exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities generate fascinating\neffects such as long-range spatial coherence and Bose-Einstein Condensation\n(BEC), which are attractive for their potential use in low threshold lasers,\nvortices and slowing light, etc. However, currently most of exciton-polariton\neffects either occur at cryogenic temperature or rely on expensive cavity\nfabrication procedures. Further exploring new semiconductor microcavities with\nstronger exciton photon interaction strength is extensively needed. Herein, we\ndemonstrate room temperature photon exciton strong coupling in hybrid\ninorganic-organic CH3NH3PbBr3 Fabry-P\\'erot microcavities for the first time.\nThe vacuum Rabi splitting energy is up to ~390 meV, which is ascribed to large\noscillator strength and photon confinement in reduced dimension of optical\nmicrocavities. With increasing pumping energy, exciton-photon coupling strength\nis weakened due to carrier screening effect, leading to occurrence of photonic\nlasing instead of polartion lasing. The demonstrated strong coupling between\nphotons and excitons in perovskite microcavities would be helpful for\ndevelopment of high performance polariton-based incoherent and coherent light\nsources, nonlinear optics, and slow light applications.\n", "  The mechanical and tribological properties of steel matrix composites (316L\nstainless steel reinforced with Cr3C2 ceramic particles) were investigated. The\nsteel matrix composites (SMC) with three reinforcing percentages (3, 6, and 9\nwt.%) were manufactured by Additive Manufacturing technologies (SLM: Selective\nLaser Melting). The wear behaviour was studied by using a pin-on-disk wear test\nat room temperature. The worn surface was analysed using Scanning Electron\nMicroscopy (SEM). The results indicated that the friction coefficient does not\nhave a clear tendency or direct correlation with the reinforcement variation\nwhile the wear rate decreases with increasing content of reinforcement. The\nbetter properties combination were achieved with 6 wt.% of reinforcement.\n", "  Despite the ever-increasing use across different sectors, the lithium-ion\nbatteries (LiBs) have continually seen serious concerns over their thermal\nvulnerability. The LiB operation is associated with the heat generation and\nbuildup effect, which manifests itself more strongly, in the form of highly\nuneven thermal distribution, for a LiB pack consisting of multiple cells. If\nnot well monitored and managed, the heating may accelerate aging and cause\nunwanted side reactions. In extreme cases, it will even cause fires and\nexplosions, as evidenced by a series of well-publicized incidents in recent\nyears. To address this threat, this paper, for the first time, seeks to\nreconstruct the three-dimensional temperature field of a LiB pack in real time.\nThe major challenge lies in how to acquire a high-fidelity reconstruction with\nconstrained computation time. In this study, a three-dimensional thermal model\nis established first for a LiB pack configured in series. Although spatially\nresolved, this model captures spatial thermal behavior with a combination of\nhigh integrity and low complexity. Given the model, the standard Kalman filter\nis then distributed to attain temperature field estimation at substantially\nreduced computational complexity. The arithmetic operation analysis and\nnumerical simulation illustrate that the proposed distributed estimation\nachieves a comparable accuracy as the centralized approach but with much less\ncomputation. This work can potentially contribute to the safer operation of the\nLiB packs in various systems dependent on LiB-based energy storage, potentially\nwidening the access of this technology to a broader range of engineering areas.\n", "  Very recently, a new graphene-like crystalline, hole-free, 2D-single-layer\ncarbon nitride C3N, has been fabricated by polymerization of\n2,3-diaminophenazine and used to fabricate a field-effect transistor device\nwith an on-off current ratio reaching (Adv. Mater. 2017, 1605625). Heat\ndissipation plays a vital role in its practical applications, and therefore the\nthermal transport properties need to be explored urgently. In this paper, we\nperform first-principles calculations combined with phonon Boltzmann transport\nequation to investigate the phononic thermal transport properties of monolayer\nC3N, and meanwhile, a comparison with graphene is given. Our calculated\nintrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of C3N is 380 W/mK at room temperature,\nwhich is one order of magnitude lower than that of graphene (3550 W/mK at 300\nK), but is greatly higher than many other typical 2D materials. The underlying\nmechanisms governing the thermal transport were thoroughly discussed and\ncompared to graphene, including group velocities, phonon relax time, the\ncontribution from phonon branches, phonon anharmonicity and size effect. The\nfundamental physics understood from this study may shed light on further\nstudies of the newly fabricated 2D crystalline C3N sheets.\n", "  Shape dynamics is a classical theory of gravity which agrees with general\nrelativity in many important cases, but possesses different gauge symmetries\nand constraints. Rather than spacetime diffeomorphism invariance, shape\ndynamics takes spatial diffeomorphism invariance and spatial Weyl invariance as\nthe fundamental gauge symmetries associated with the gravitational field.\nDespite these differences, shape dynamics and general relativity generically\npredict the same dynamics---there exist gauge-fixings of each theory that\nensure agreement with the other. However, these gauge-fixing conditions are not\nnecessarily globally well-defined and it is therefore possible to find\nsolutions of the shape dynamics equations of motion that agree with general\nrelativity on some open neighborhoods, but which have different global\nstructures. In particular, the black hole solutions of the two theories\ndisagree globally. Understanding these novel \"shape dynamic black holes\" is the\nprimary goal of this thesis.\n", "  This is the first complete English translation of Oratio De Meteoris Vi\nElectrica Ortis - seminal work of the great Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov\n(1711-1765). It was presented at the public meeting of the St.Petersburg\nAcademy of Sciences in November 1753 and is traditionally listed among\nLomonosov's most important scientific accomplishments. In the Discourse,\nLomonosov presents an original theory of generation of electricity in the air\nand lightning, many elements of which are profoundly correct even by present\nday understanding of the phenomenon. The theory is based on experimental\nobservations and measurements and supported by some mathematical estimates. The\nbasis of the Lomonosov theory is the idea of vertical air movements as the main\ncause of atmospheric electricity - the immersion of the cold upper strata of\nthe atmosphere into the lower (warmer) layers causes mechanical friction of\nminiscular particles in the air against each other, that results in generation\nof atmospheric electricity. Miniscular particles of two types are required:\nthose of water (vapors) capable of accumulation of the electricity, and organic\ncompounds/fatty particles in the air which are involved in production of the\nelectricity via friction. Electrically charged droplets are assumed to be\nspread throughout the entire volume of the cloud. The transfer of charges from\nindividual fatty particles to droplets of water in the clouds via countless\ncollisions leads to formation in atmosphere, in clouds of strong electric\nfields, which are the cause of the appearance of lightning. At the end of\nDiscourse Lomonosov suggests explanations of the Northern lights (aurora\nborealis) and comet tails as purely electrical phenomena originating from the\ndown- and updrafts in the atmospheres, like in his theory of lightning,and\nexpanding beyond them into the surrounding ether.\n", "  Since 2013, observations of Neptune with small telescopes have resulted in\nseveral detections of long-lived bright atmospheric features that have also\nbeen observed by large telescopes such as Keck II or Hubble. The combination of\nboth types of images allows the study of the long term evolution of major cloud\nsystems in the planet. In 2013 and 2014 two bright features were present on the\nplanet at southern mid latitudes. These may have merged in late 2014, possibly\nleading to the formation of a single bright feature observed during 2015 at the\nsame latitude. This cloud system was first observed in January 2015 and nearly\ncontinuously from July to December 2015 in observations with telescopes in the\n2 to 10 meter class and in images from amateur astronomers. These images show\nthe bright spot as a compact feature at 40.1 deg South planetographic latitude\nwell resolved from a nearby bright zonal band that extended from 42 deg South\nto 20 deg South. Tracking its motion from July to November 2015 suggests a\nlongitudinal oscillation of 16 deg in amplitude with a 90 day period, typical\nof dark spots on Neptune and similar to the Great Red Spot oscillation in\nJupiter. The limited time covered by high-resolution observations only covers\none full oscillation and other interpretations of the changing motions could be\npossible. HST images in September 2015 show the presence of a dark spot at\nshort wavelengths in the southern flank of the bright cloud observed throughout\n2015.\n", "  Strong electron correlations and interference effects are discussed in\ncapacitively coupled side attached and embedded quantum dots. The finite - U\nmean field slave boson approach is used to study many-body effects. In the\nlinear range the many-body resonances exhibit SU(4) Kondo or Kondo-Fano like\ncharacter and their properties in the corresponding arms are close to the\nproperties of embedded or T- shape double dot systems respectively. Breaking of\nthe spin symmetry in one of the arms or in both allows for the formation of\nmany-body resonances of SU(3) or SU(2) symmetries in the linear range.\n", "  Several complicated non-linear models exist which simulate the physical\nprocesses leading to fluctuations in global climate. Some of these more\nadvanced models use observations to constrain various parameters involved.\nHowever, they tend to be very computationally expensive. Also, the exact\nphysical processes that affect the climate variations have not been completely\ncomprehended. Therefore, to obtain an insight into global climate, we have\ndeveloped a physically motivated reduced climate model. The model utilizes a\nnovel mathematical formulation involving a non-linear delay differential\nequation to study temperature fluctuations when subjected to imposed radiative\nforcing. We have further incorporated simplified equations to test the effect\nof speculated mechanisms of climate forcing and evaluated the extent of their\ninfluence. The findings are significant in our efforts to predict climate\nchange and help in policy framing necessary to tackle it.\n", "  Solid-state approaches to quantum information technology are attractive\nbecause they are scalable. The coherent transport of quantum information over\nlarge distances, as required for a practical quantum computer, has been\ndemonstrated by coupling solid-state qubits to photons1. As an alternative\napproach for a spin-based quantum computer, single electrons have also been\ntransferred between distant quantum dots in times faster than their coherence\ntime2, 3. However, there have been no demonstrations to date of techniques that\ncan coherently transfer scalable qubits and perform quantum operations on them\nat the same time. The resulting so-called flying qubits are attractive because\nthey allow for control over qubit separation and non-local entanglement with\nstatic gate voltages, which is a significant advantage over other solid-state\nqubits in confined systems for integration of quantum circuits. Here we report\nthe transport and manipulation of qubits over distances of 6 microns within 40\nps, in an Aharonov-Bohm ring connected to two-channel wires that have a tunable\ntunnel coupling between channels. The flying qubit state is defined by the\npresence of a travelling electron in either channel of the wire, and can be\ncontrolled without a magnetic field. Our device has shorter quantum gates,\nlonger coherence lengths (~86 {\\mu}m at 70 mK), and shorter operation times\n(~10 ps or 100 GHz) than other solid-state flying qubit implementations4, 5,\nwhich makes our solid-state flying qubit potentially scalable.\n", "  The transmission phase across a quantum dot (QD) is expected to show\nmesoscopic behavior, where the appearance of a phase lapse between Coulomb\npeaks (CPs) as a function of the gate voltage depends on the orbital parity\nrelation between the corresponding CPs. On the other hand, such mesoscopic\nbehavior has been observed only in a limited QD configuration (a few-electron\nand single-level transport regime) and universal phase lapses by $\\pi$ between\nconsecutive CPs have been reported for all the other configurations. Here, we\nreport on the measurement of a transmission phase across a QD around the\ncrossover between single-level and multilevel transport regimes employing an\noriginal two-path quantum interferometer. We find mesoscopic behavior for the\nstudied QD. Our results show that the universal phase lapse, a longstanding\npuzzle of the phase shift, is absent for a standard QD, where several tens of\nsuccessive well-separated CPs are observed.\n", "  The excluded volume effects of randomly branched polymers are investigated.\nTo approach this problem we assume the Gaussian distribution of segments around\nthe center of gravity. Once this approximation is introduced, we can make use\nof the same method as employed for linear molecules. By simulating a\nmodel-polymer system, it is found that the excluded volume effects of branched\npolymers are manifested pronouncedly under any conditions from the dilution\nlimit to the melt, including the $\\Theta$ state; every result satisfies the\nrestraining condition: $\\langle s^2\\rangle^{1/2} \\ge N^{1/d}$ in accord with\nour experiences. As a result the Gaussian approximation extracts the essential\nfeatures of the excluded volume effects of branched molecules.\n", "  The generation of indirect combustion noise by compositional inhomogeneities\nis examined theoretically. For this, the compact nozzle theory\nof~\\cite{MARBLE_CANDEL_JSV1977} is extended to a multi-component gas mixture,\nand the chemical potential function is introduced as an additional acoustic\nsource mechanism. Transfer functions for subcritical and supercritical nozzle\nflows are derived and the contribution of compositional noise is compared to\nentropy noise and direct noise by considering an idealized nozzle downstream of\nthe combustor exit. It is shown that compositional noise is dependent on the\nlocal mixture composition and can exceed entropy noise for fuel-lean conditions\nand supercritical nozzle flows. This suggests that the compositional indirect\nnoise requires potential consideration with the implementation of low-emission\ncombustors.\n", "  We present a new type of matrix regularization, which is based on\nmatrix-valued functions defined on a cylinder. If non-commutative coordinates\nof a fuzzy space are defined by a regularization of such functions, we show\nthat a classical limit for the fuzzy spaces exists, when the matrix-valued\nfunctions nearly commute. In this case, the classical limit of the fuzzy space\nis a manifold, which is composed of coordinate patches that are defined by the\ndiagonal entries of the diagonalized matrix-valued functions. As applications,\nan interpolation for direct sums of fuzzy spaces is described and a fuzzy\nstring vertex with classical limit, i.e. a surface interconnecting three\ncircles, is constructed.\n", "  We find a new quantum system associated with the Wilson Orthogonal\nPolynomial. In order to establish correspondence between the recent\nreformulation of quantum mechanic without potential function [1-2] and the\nconvention quantum mechanics, we derived the potential function of the new\nquantum system using any of the proposed formulas in [4]. To achieve this, we\nused the matrix elements of the potential function and the basis element of the\nconfiguration space.\n", "  Searches for high-mass resonances decaying to pairs of standard model bosons\nusing ATLAS and CMS detectors are presented. The searches use 15 - 36\n$\\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected at the\ncentre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the LHC. Many different final states have\nbeen considered and the results are interpreted in a range of theories beyond\nthe standard model of particle physics, most common being heavy vector triplet\nand warped extra dimensions.\n", "  When a vortex refracts surface waves, the momentum flux carried by the waves\nchanges direction and the waves induce a reaction force on the vortex. We study\nexperimentally the resulting vortex distortion. Incoming surface gravity waves\nimpinge on a steady vortex of velocity $U_0$ driven magneto-hydrodynamically at\nthe bottom of a fluid layer. The waves induce a shift of the vortex center in\nthe direction transverse to wave propagation, together with a decrease in\nsurface vorticity. We interpret these two phenomena in the framework introduced\nby Craik and Leibovich (1976): we identify the dimensionless Stokes drift\n$S=U_s/U_0$ as the relevant control parameter, $U_s$ being the Stokes drift\nvelocity of the waves. We propose a simple vortex line model which indicates\nthat the shift of the vortex center originates from a balance between vorticity\nadvection by the Stokes drift and self-advection of the vortex. The decrease in\nsurface vorticity is interpreted as a consequence of vorticity expulsion by the\nfast Stokes drift, which confines it at depth. This purely hydrodynamic process\nis analogous to the magnetohydrodynamic expulsion of magnetic field by a\nrapidly moving conductor through the electromagnetic skin effect. We study\nvorticity expulsion in the limit of fast Stokes drift and deduce that the\nsurface vorticity decreases as $1/S$, a prediction which is compatible with the\nexperimental data. Such wave-induced vortex distortions have important\nconsequences for the nonlinear regime of wave refraction: the refraction angle\nrapidly decreases with wave intensity.\n", "  Purpose: To compare two methods that use x-ray spectral information to image\nexternally administered contrast agents: K-edge subtraction and basis-function\ndecomposition (the A-space method), Methods: The K-edge method uses narrow band\nx-ray spectra with energies infinitesimally below and above the contrast\nmaterial K-edge energy. The A-space method uses a broad spectrum x-ray tube\nsource and measures the transmitted spectrum with photon counting detectors\nwith pulse height analysis. The methods are compared by their signal to noise\nratio (SNR) divided by the patient dose for an imaging task to decide whether\ncontrast material is present in a soft tissue background. The performance with\niodine or gadolinium containing contrast material is evaluated as a function of\nobject thickness and the x-ray tube voltage of the A-space method. Results: For\na tube voltages above 60 kV and soft tissue thicknesses from 5 to 25 g/cm^2,\nthe A-space method has a larger SNR per dose than the K-edge subtraction method\nfor either iodine or gadolinium containing contrast agent. Conclusion: Even\nwith the unrealistic spectra assumed for the K-edge method, the A-space method\nhas a substantially larger SNR per patient dose.\n", "  The list of materials systems displaying both electric and magnetic long\nrange order is short. Oxides, however, concentrate numerous examples of\nmultiferroicity with, in some cases, a large magnetoelectric coupling. As a\nresult, a fruitful research field has emerged contemporaneously with the\nconsolidation of spintronic. The synergy between multiferroics and spintronics\nwas meant to be inevitable and hence the characterization of spintronic\nfunctionalities in multiferroic materials is rather abundant. The aim of the\npresent chapter is to review the oxide heterostructures where magnetoelectric\ncoupling is demonstrated by means of spintronic functionalities (i.e.\nmagnetoresistance, anisotropic magnetoresistance, giant magnetoresistance or\ntunnel magnetoresistance).\n", "  This work focuses on optical multiplexers for mid-IR broadband source in gas\nsensing application. The design of multiplexer configurations based on two\ntypes of diffraction gratings is discussed. Owing to utility of Gaussian\napproximation of the field and Fourier Optics, we developed a semi-analytical\ntool allowing to evaluate the responses of array waveguide grating (AWG) and\nplanar concave grating (PCG). This approach also opened the way to implement\nnumerical phase error analysis by introducing normal distribution of errors and\nto study the correlation between standard deviation of phase errors and the\nlevel of crosstalk. FTIR spectroscopy measurement results of 5.65 micrometer\nAWGs, built with SiGe graded index core encapsulated in a thick Si cladding on\nstandard silicon substrate, are compared with the theoretical expectations. We\nhave also performed evaluation of AWG response at elevated temperatures, in the\nrange between 20oC and 41oC. The spectral shift showed linear dependence with\nthe temperature, which is in a good agreement with simulation predictions.\n", "  In this sequel to works D(11.1) (arXiv:1406.0929 [math.DG]), D(11.2)\n(arXiv:1412.0771 [hep-th]), and D(11.3.1) (arXiv:1508.02347 [math.DG]), we\nre-examine --- and reformulate when in need --- several basic notions in super\n$C^{\\infty}$-algebraic geometry as guided by the mathematical formulation of\nRamond-Neveu-Schwarz fermionic strings and of Green-Schwarz fermionic strings\nfrom the viewpoint of Grothendieck on Algebraic Geometry. Two theorems that are\nthe super counterpart of Theorem~3.1.1 and Theorem~3.2.1 of D(11.3.1) are\nproved. They unify the notion of \"smooth maps from an Azumaya/matrix super\nsmooth manifold with a fundamental module to a super smooth manifold\"\nintroduced in D(11.2), making it a complete super parallel to the setting for\nD-branes in the realm of algebraic geometry in D(1) (arXiv:0709.1515 [math.AG])\nand D(2) (arXiv:0809.2121 [math.AG]), and in the realm of differential or\n$C^{\\infty}$-algebraic geometry in D(11.1) and D(11.3.1). A prototypical\ndefinition of dynamical fermionic stacked D-brane world-volume on a space-time\nin the same spirit of RNS fermionic strings or GS fermionic strings is thus\nlaid down. Similar to D(11.3.1), which paved the path to the construction of\nnon-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action (D(13.1) (arXiv:1606.08529 [hep-th])) and\nthe standard action (D(13.3) (arXiv:1704.03237 [hep-th])) for fundamental\nbosonic stacked D-branes, the current notes shall serve the same for the\nconstruction of supersymmetric action for fundamental fermionic stacked\nD-branes of various dimensions --- a theme of another subseries of the\nD-project. A notion of \"noncommutative $C^{\\infty}$-rings\" and \"morphism\"\nbetween them is introduced at the end as a byproduct.\n", "  The glass transition plays a central role in nature as well as in industry,\nranging from biological systems such as proteins and DNA to polymers and\nmetals. Yet the fundamental understanding of the glass transition which is a\nprerequisite for optimized application of glass formers is still lacking. Glass\nformers show motional processes over an extremely broad range of timescales,\ncovering more than ten orders of magnitude, meaning that a full understanding\nof the glass transition needs to comprise this tremendous range in timescales.\nHere we report on first-time simultaneous neutron and dielectric spectroscopy\ninvestigations of three glass-forming liquids, probing in a single experiment\nthe full range of dynamics. For two van der Waals liquids we locate in the\npressure-temperature phase diagram lines of identical dynamics of the molecules\non both second and picosecond timescales. This confirms predictions of the\nisomorph theory and effectively reduces the phase diagram from two to one\ndimension. The implication is that dynamics on widely different timescales are\ngoverned by the same underlying mechanisms.\n", "  The Galactic Center is the closest galactic nucleus that can be studied with\nunprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity. We summarize recent basic\nobservational results on Sagittarius A* and the conditions for star formation\nin the central stellar cluster. We cover results from the radio, infrared, and\nX-ray domain and include results from simulation as well. From (sub-)mm and\nnear-infrared variability and near-infrared polarization data we find that the\nSgrA* system (supermassive black hole spin, a potential temporary accretion\ndisk and/or outflow) is well ordered in its geometrical orientation and in its\nemission process that we assume to reflect the accretion process onto the\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH).\n", "  More than 4,600 non-academic music groups emerged in the USSR and post-Soviet\nindependent nations in 1960--2015, performing in 275 genres. Some of the groups\nbecame legends and survived for decades, while others vanished and are known\nnow only to select music history scholars. We built a network of the groups\nbased on sharing at least one performer. We discovered that major network\nmeasures serve as reasonably accurate predictors of the groups' success. The\nproposed network-based success exploration and prediction methods are\ntransferable to other areas of arts and humanities that have medium- or\nlong-term team-based collaborations.\n", "  Edge illumination (EI) is a non-interferometric X-ray phase contrast imaging\n(XPCI) method that has been successfully implemented with conventional\npolychromatic sources, thanks to its relaxed coherence requirements. Like other\nXPCI methods, EI enables the retrieval of absorption, refraction and\nultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) signals. However, current retrieval\nalgorithms require three input frames, which have so far been acquired under as\nmany different illumination conditions, in separate exposures. These\nillumination conditions can be achieved by deliberately misaligning the set-up\nin different ways. Each one of these misaligned configurations can then be used\nto record frames containing a mixture of the absorption, refraction and\nscattering signals. However, this acquisition scheme involves lengthy exposure\ntimes, which can also introduce errors to the retrieved signals. Such errors\nhave, so far, been mitigated by careful image acquisition and analysis.\nHowever, further reduction to image acquisition time and errors due to sample\nmask/sample movement can increase the advantages offered by the EI technique,\nand enable targeting more challenging applications. In this paper, we describe\ntwo simplified set-ups that exploit state-of-the-art detector technologies to\nachieve single-shot multi-modal imaging.\n", "  We propose a family of two-phase-fluid models for a full-cone turbulent round\njet that describe its dynamics in a simple but comprehensive manner with the\napex angle of the cone being the main disposable parameter. The basic\nassumptions are that (i) the jet is statistically stationary and that (ii) it\ncan be approximated by a mixture of two fluids with their phases in dynamic\nequilibrium (so-called Locally Homogeneous Flow). To derive the model, we\nimpose either full or partial conservation of the initial mass and total power\nfluxes, introducing mass and power loss factors as disposable parameters. Our\nmodel equations admit implicit analytical and numerical solutions for the\ncomposite density and velocity of the two-phase fluid, both as functions of the\ndistance from the nozzle, from which the dynamic pressure and the mass\nentrainment rate are calculated. Moreover, we show that the predictions of our\nmodels compare well with experimental data for single-phase turbulent air jets\nand atomizing liquid jets.\n", "  Recent theoretical predictions of \"unprecedented proximity\" of the electronic\nground state of iridium fluorides to the SU(2) symmetric $j_{\\mathrm{eff}}=1/2$\nlimit, relevant for superconductivity in iridates, motivated us to investigate\ntheir crystal and electronic structure. To this aim, we performed\nhigh-resolution x-ray powder diffraction, Ir L$_3$-edge resonant inelastic\nx-ray scattering, and quantum chemical calculations on Rb$_2$[IrF$_6$] and\nother iridium fluorides. Our results are consistent with the Mott insulating\nscenario predicted by Birol and Haule [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 096403 (2015)],\nbut we observe a sizable deviation of the $j_{\\mathrm{eff}}=1/2$ state from the\nSU(2) symmetric limit. Interactions beyond the first coordination shell of\niridium are negligible, hence the iridium fluorides do not show any magnetic\nordering down to at least 20 K. A larger spin-orbit coupling in iridium\nfluorides compared to oxides is ascribed to a reduction of the degree of\ncovalency, with consequences on the possibility to realize spin-orbit-induced\nstrongly correlated physics in iridium fluorides.\n", "  Using the dependent coordinates, the local Lagrange-Poincar\\'e equations and\nequations for the relative equilibria are obtained for a mechanical system with\na symmetry describing the motion of two interacting scalar particles on a\nspecial Riemannian manifold (the product of the total space of the principal\nfiber bundle and the vector space) on which a free proper and isometric action\nof a compact semi-simple Lie group is given. As in gauge theories, dependent\ncoordinates are implicitly determined by means of equations representing the\nlocal sections of the principal fiber bundle.\n", "  The influence of space-time torsion on gravitational interaction at\ncosmological and astrophysical scales is discussed within the framework of\ngauge gravitation theory in Riemann-Cartan space-time. It is shown that the\ninteraction of the vacuum torsion with proper angular momentums of gravitating\nobjects leads to appearance of additional gravitational force which can be\nmanifested at astrophysical scale.\n", "  We report on the potentialities offered by a fixed-target experiment at the\nLHC using the proton and ion LHC beams (AFTER@LHC project) regarding the study\nof J/psi exclusive-photoproduction in pA and AA collisions. The foreseen usage\nof polarised targets (hydrogen, deuteron, helium) gives access to measurements\nof the Single-Transverse-Spin Asymmetries of this exclusive process, therefore\nallowing one to access the helicity-flip Generalised Parton Distribution (GPD)\nEg. We detail the expected yields of photoproduced J/psi in proton-hydrogen and\nlead-hydrogen collisions and discuss the statistical uncertainties on the\nasymmetry measurement for one year of data taking at the LHC.\n", "  An ion-beam compressed by an external electric force is characterized by a\nunique non-equilibrium distribution function. This is a special case of Tsallis\ndistribution with entropy index q=2, which allows the system to possess\nappreciably low thermal energy. The thermal radiation by such compressed\nion-beam has been investigated in this work. As the system is non extensive,\nPlanck law of radiation has been modified using Tsallis thermostatistics for\nthe investigation of the system. The average energy of radiation has been\nderived by introducing the non extensive partition function in the statistical\nrelation of internal energy. The spectral energy density, spectral radiation\nand total radiation power have also been computed. It is seen that a microwave\nradiation will be emitted by the compressed ion-beam. The fusion energy gain Q\n(ratio of the output fusion power to the power consumed by the system)\naccording to the proposed scheme (R. K. Paul 2015) using compressed ion-beam by\nelectric field will not change significantly as the radiated power is very\nsmall.\n", "  The output of a motor is work, while the output of a clock is information.\nHere it is discussed how a molecular motor can produce both, work and\ninformation, depending on the load. If the ratio of the backward and forward\nstepping rates of a molecular motor increases exponentially with load, the\nchange in free energy per step can be used to produce only work (at stall\nforce) or only timing information (at zero force), or anything in between.\n", "  One application of the Cosmological Gravitational Lensing in General\nRelativity is the measurement of the Hubble constant H_0 using the time delay\nDelta t between multiple images of lensed quasars. This method has already been\napplied, obtaining a value of H_0 compatible with that obtained from the SNe\n1A, but non compatible with that obtained studying the anisotropies of the CMB.\nThis difference could be a statistical fluctuation or an indication of new\nphysics beyond the Standard Model of Cosmology, so it desirable to improve the\nprecision of the measurements. At the current technological capabilities it is\npossible to obtain H_0 to a percent level uncertainty, so a more accurate\ntheoretical model could be necessary in order to increase the precision about\nthe determination of H_0. The actual formula which relates Delta t with H_0 is\napproximated; in this paper we expose a proposal to go beyond the previous\nanalysis and, within the context of a new model, we obtain a more precise\nformula than that present in the Literature.\n", "  A number of groups have recently been active in searching for gradients in\nthe ob- served Faraday rotation measure (RM) across jets of Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGNs) on various scales and estimating their reliability. Such RM\nstructures provide direct evidence for the presence of an azimuthal magnetic\nfield component, which may be associated with a helical jet magnetic field, as\nis expected based on the results of many theoretical studies. We present new\nparsec-scale RM maps of 4 AGNs here, and analyze their transverse RM structures\ntogether with those for 5 previously published RM maps. All these jets display\ntransverse RM gradients with significances of at least 3{\\sigma}. This is part\nof an ongoing effort to establish how common transverse RM gradients that may\nbe associated with helical or toroidal magnetic fields are in AGNs on parsec\nscales.\n", "  Following the first two annual intensity mapping workshops at Stanford in\nMarch 2016 and Johns Hopkins in June 2017, we report on the recent advances in\ntheory, instrumentation and observation that were presented in these meetings\nand some of the opportunities and challenges that were identified looking\nforward. With preliminary detections of CO, [CII], Lya and low-redshift 21cm,\nand a host of experiments set to go online in the next few years, the field is\nrapidly progressing on all fronts, with great anticipation for a flood of new\nexciting results. This current snapshot provides an efficient reference for\nexperts in related fields and a useful resource for nonspecialists. We begin by\nintroducing the concept of line-intensity mapping and then discuss the broad\narray of science goals that will be enabled, ranging from the history of star\nformation, reionization and galaxy evolution to measuring baryon acoustic\noscillations at high redshift and constraining theories of dark matter,\nmodified gravity and dark energy. After reviewing the first detections reported\nto date, we survey the experimental landscape, presenting the parameters and\ncapabilities of relevant instruments such as COMAP, mmIMe, AIM-CO, CCAT-p,\nTIME, CONCERTO, CHIME, HIRAX, HERA, STARFIRE, MeerKAT/SKA and SPHEREx. Finally,\nwe describe recent theoretical advances: different approaches to modeling line\nluminosity functions, several techniques to separate the desired signal from\nforegrounds, statistical methods to analyze the data, and frameworks to\ngenerate realistic intensity map simulations.\n", "  We describe some bulk statistics of historical initial line outages and the\nimplications for forming contingency lists and understanding which initial\noutages are likely to lead to further cascading. We use historical outage data\nto estimate the effect of weather on cascading via cause codes and via NOAA\nstorm data. Bad weather significantly increases outage rates and interacts with\ncascading effects, and should be accounted for in cascading models and\nsimulations. We suggest how weather effects can be incorporated into the OPA\ncascading simulation and validated. There are very good prospects for improving\ndata processing and models for the bulk statistics of historical outage data so\nthat cascading can be better understood and quantified.\n", "  Future practical implementation of secure quantum communication technology in\na multiuser network environment would require automatic monitoring of the\noptical link condition and quantum system parameters, along with adjusting them\nin real time according to protocol restrictions. We demonstrate how\nsoftware-defined networking (SDN) paradigm can be used for addressing this\nproblem on the example of a subcarrier wave quantum communication system, which\nis promising for network applications. We propose a novel approach to dynamic\nquantum network routing and communication security based on SDN OpenFlow\nprotocol. SDN-operated dynamic switching between different data encryption\nmethods, quantum or classic, will enable to organize virtual encoding channels\nwith an ability to set the required Quality of Service level for\nsecurity/bandwidth. These developments will further increase the feasibility of\nquantum technologies from the network perspective and contribute to bringing\nthem to industrial scale.\n", "  A network-based approach is presented to investigate the cerebrovascular flow\npatterns during atrial fibrillation (AF) with respect to normal sinus rhythm\n(NSR). AF, the most common cardiac arrhythmia with faster and irregular\nbeating, has been recently and independently associated with the increased risk\nof dementia. However, the underlying hemodynamic mechanisms relating the two\npathologies remain mainly undetermined so far; thus the contribution of\nmodeling and refined statistical tools is valuable. Pressure and flow rate\ntemporal series in NSR and AF are here evaluated along representative cerebral\nsites (from carotid arteries to capillary brain circulation), exploiting\nreliable artificially built signals recently obtained from an in silico\napproach. The complex network analysis evidences, in a synthetic and original\nway, a dramatic signal variation towards the distal/capillary cerebral regions\nduring AF, which has no counterpart in NSR conditions. At the large artery\nlevel, networks obtained from both AF and NSR hemodynamic signals exhibit\nelongated and chained features, which are typical of pseudo-periodic series.\nThese aspects are almost completely lost towards the microcirculation during\nAF, where the networks are topologically more circular and present random-like\ncharacteristics. As a consequence, all the physiological phenomena at\nmicrocerebral level ruled by periodicity - such as regular perfusion, mean\npressure per beat, and average nutrient supply at cellular level - can be\nstrongly compromised, since the AF hemodynamic signals assume irregular\nbehaviour and random-like features. Through a powerful approach which is\ncomplementary to the classical statistical tools, the present findings further\nstrengthen the potential link between AF hemodynamic and cognitive decline.\n", "  Fractional derivatives are nonlocal differential operators of real order that\noften appear in models of anomalous diffusion and a variety of nonlocal\nphenomena. Recently, a version of the Schr\\\"odinger Equation containing a\nfractional Laplacian has been proposed. In this work, we develop a Fractional\nPath Integral Monte Carlo algorithm that can be used to study the finite\ntemperature behavior of the time-independent Fractional Schr\\\"odinger Equation\nfor a variety of potentials. In so doing, we derive an analytic form for the\nfinite temperature fractional free particle density matrix and demonstrate how\nit can be sampled to acquire new sets of particle positions. We employ this\nalgorithm to simulate both the free particle and $^{4}$He (Aziz) Hamiltonians.\nWe find that the fractional Laplacian strongly encourages particle\ndelocalization, even in the presence of interactions, suggesting that\nfractional Hamiltonians may manifest atypical forms of condensation. Our work\nopens the door to studying fractional Hamiltonians with arbitrarily complex\npotentials that escape analytical solutions.\n", "  The BCS-type second-order phase transition of a classical Langmuir wave\nsystem is identified theoretically and numerically. The transition takes place\nbetween two states: Langmuir wave turbulence (LWT) and Langmuir wave\nsupercontinuum (LWSC), the latter of which exhibits broad power spectra with\nsignificant spatiotemporal coherence when a certain number of plasmons (plasma\nwave quanta) are excited in the system. In the LWT-LWSC transition, the\nmodulational instability and resulting creation of plasmon pairs are the\nclassical counterparts of the Cooper instability and creation of Cooper pairs\nin superconducting states. The Bose-Einstein condensation of Cooper pairs in\nsuperconducting states is replaced by the Kuramoto oscillator-entrainment of\nplasmon pairs in a LWSC. The order parameter of the LWSC state, which is\ndefined as the mean field of the plasmon pairs, takes on a significant value,\nwhich clearly indicates that a macroscopic number of plasmon pairs occupy a\nsingle momentum state with an identical phase in the LWSC. The emergence of\nspatiotemporal coherence and the decrease in the phase randomization are\nconsidered as development of long-range order and spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking, respectively, indicating that the LWT-LWSC transition is a second\norder phase transition phenomenon. By this transition, U(1) symmetry of LWT is\nbroken. The LWSC is, in terms of plasma physics, a so-called\nBernstein-Greene-Kruskal mode characterized by its undamped nature.\n", "  The effects induced by muons with very low energies are usually neglected. In\nfact, they could represent a source of radioactive background due to capture\nprocesses in different materials, which in most of cases produce radioactive\nisotopes, and thus they must be taken into account. Plastic track detectors\nhave been used in the present paper to measure the ratio between the vertical\nand horizontal components of the flux of very low energy terrestrial muons at\nground level. The data have been collected during 160 days.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array is the main global project of ground-based\ngamma-ray astronomy for the coming decades. Performance will be significantly\nimproved relative to present instruments, allowing a new insight into the\nhigh-energy Universe [1]. The nominal CTA southern array will include a\nsub-array of seventy 4 m telescopes spread over a few square kilometers to\nstudy the sky at extremely high energies, with the opening of a new window in\nthe multi-TeV energy range. The Gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope (GCT) is one of\nthe proposed telescope designs for that sub-array. The GCT prototype recorded\nits first Cherenkov light on sky in 2015. After an assessment phase in 2016,\nnew observations have been performed successfully in 2017. The GCT\ncollaboration plans to install its first telescopes and cameras on the CTA site\nin Chile in 2018-2019 and to contribute a number of telescopes to the\nsubsequent CTA production phase.\n", "  In this paper we implement a simple strategy, based on Jin and Braza's\nmethod, to deal with nonreflecting outlet boundary conditions for\nincompressible Navier-Stokes flows using the method of smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH). The outflow boundary conditions are implemented using an\noutflow zone downstream of the outlet, where particles are moved using an\noutgoing wave equation for the velocity field so that feedback noise from the\noutlet boundary is greatly reduced. For unidirectional flow across the outlet,\nthis condition reduces to Orlanski's wave equation. The performance of the\nmethod is demonstrated through several two-dimensional test problems, including\nunsteady, plane Poiseuille flow, flow between two inclined plates, the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability in a channel, and flow in a constricted conduit,\nand in three-dimensions for turbulent flow in a $90^{\\circ}$ section of a\ncurved square pipe. The results show that spurious waves incident from the\noutlet are effectively absorbed and that steady-state laminar flows can be\nmaintained for much longer times compared to periodic boundary conditions. In\naddition, time-dependent anisotropies in the flow, like fluid recirculations,\nare convected across the outlet in a very stable and accurate manner.\n", "  Nanoscale amplification of non-linear processes in solid-state devices opens\nnovel applications in nano-electronics, nano-medicine or high energy conversion\nfor example. Coupling few nano-joules laser energy at a nanometer scale for\nstrong field physics is demonstrated. We report enhancement of high harmonic\ngeneration in nano-structured semiconductors using nanoscale amplification of a\nmid-infrared laser in the sample rather than using large laser amplifier\nsystems. Field amplification is achieved through light confinement in\nnano-structured semiconductor 3D waveguides. The high harmonic nano-converter\nconsists of an array of zinc-oxide nanocones. They exhibit a large\namplification volume, 6 orders of magnitude larger than previously reported and\navoid melting observed in metallic plasmonic structures. The amplification of\nhigh harmonics is observed by coupling only 5-10 nano-joules of a 3.2 {\\mu}m\nhigh repetition-rate OPCPA laser at the entrance of each nanocone. Harmonic\namplification (factor 30) depends on the laser energy input, wavelength and\nnanocone geometry.\n", "  The sequence of phase transitions during the hot history of the universe is\nfollowed within a phenomenological framework. Particular emphasis is put on the\nQCD confinement transition, which is at reach under earth laboratory\nconditions. A tepid inflationary scenario on the GUT scale with bubble grow at\nmoderate supercooling is discussed.\n", "  The use of a band offset between the two leads of an electron pump driven by\na local oscillating voltage is shown to increase the pump current dramatically.\nThe structure of the electron transmission suggests the existence of dominant\ninelastic channels which we call pipelines. This permits the formulation of a\nsimple model that gives a physical account of the numerical results for a\nrealistic device. A spectral analysis reveals the pump current to be carried by\nscattering states with initial energy deep within the Fermi sea and not at its\nsurface, thereby rendering the effect insensitive to temperature. We show this\nis compatible with the current flowing near the Fermi surface in the leads.\n", "  We study nonequilibrium transport and noise in a generic dissipative\ntight-binding model. Within a real-time path integral approach, we derive\nformally exact series expressions in the number of tunneling events for the\nnoise valid for arbitrary bias, frequency and temperature. At zero temperature,\nthe low-frequency noise can be summed in analytic form. The resulting\nShiba-like $|\\omega|$-singularity is a consequence of the $1/t^2$ decay law for\nthe current correlation function. At finite temperature, this singularity is\nsmoothed out.\n", "  In this Rapid Research Note the application of recently introduced [Physica A\n277 (2000) 157] entropic measure S_Delta of spatial disorder for systems of\nfinite-sized objects is presented. In the thermodynamic limit the critical\nbehaviour of coarsened lattice model of random two-phase systems is illustrated\nfor certain grain size distributions (GSDs) and chosen parameters. Also the\nchanges of spatial disorder, quantified by S_Delta, between the limit GSDs\nclearly show that the topological equivalence of the two phases is broken.\n", "  We derive semiclassical trace formulae including Gutzwiller's trace formula\nusing coherent states. This formulation has several advantages over the usual\ncoordinate-space formulation. Using a coherent-state basis makes it immediately\nobvious that classical periodic orbits make separate contributions to the trace\nof the quantum-mechanical time evolution operator. In addition, our approach is\nmanifestly canonically invariant at all stages, and leads to the simplest\npossible derivation of Gutzwiller's formula.\n", "  We review recent experimental and theoretical work on superconductivity in\nultrasmall metallic grains, i.e. grains sufficiently small that the conduction\nelectron energy spectrum becomes discrete. The discrete excitation spectrum of\nan individual grain can be measured by the technique of single-electron\ntunneling spectroscopy, and reveals parity effects indicative of pairing\ncorrelations in the grain. After introducing the discrete BCS model that has\nbeen used to model such grains, we review a phenomenological, grand-canonical,\nvariational BCS theory describing the paramagnetic breakdown of these pairing\ncorrelations with increasing magnetic field. We also review recent canonical\ntheories that have been developed to describe how pairing correlations change\nduring the crossover, with decreasing grain size, from the bulk limit to the\nlimit of few electrons, and compare their results to those obtained using\nRichardson's exact solution of the discrete BCS model. [The present review,\nwhich is addressed at readers interested exclusively in superconducting aspects\nof ultrasmall grains, is an excerpt from a more general review of ultrasmall\nmetallic grains, cond-mat/0101019, in which nonequilibrium excitations,\nspin-orbit scattering, ferromagnetism and the effect of a magnetic impurity are\nreviewed, too.]\n", "  By use of the conservation laws a four-site Hubbard model coupled to a\nparticle bath within an external magnetic field in z-direction was\ndiagonalized. The analytical dependence of both the eigenvalues and the\neigenstates on the interaction strength, the chemical potential and magnetic\nfield was calculated. It is demonstrated that the low temperature behaviour is\ndetermined by a delicate interplay between many-particle states differing in\nelectron number and spin if the electron density is away from half-filling. The\ngrand partition sum is calculated and the specific heat, the suszeptibility as\nwell as various correlation functions and spectral functions are given in\ndependence of the interaction strength, the electron occupation and the applied\nmagnetic field. Furthermore, for both the grand canonical and the canonical\nensemble the so called crossing points of the suszeptibility are calculated.\nThey confirm the universal value predicted by Vollhardt [1].\n", "  We review the density of states and related quantities of quasi\none-dimensional disordered Peierls systems in which fluctuation effects of a\nbackscattering potential play a crucial role. The low-energy behavior of\nnon-interacting fermions which are subject to a static random backscattering\npotential will be described by the fluctuating gap model (FGM). Recently, the\nFGM has also been used to explain the pseudogap phenomenon in high-$T_c$\nsuperconductors. After an elementary introduction to the FGM in the context of\ncommensurate and incommensurate Peierls chains, we develop a non-perturbative\nmethod which allows for a simultaneous calculation of the density of states\n(DOS) and the inverse localization length. First, we recover all known results\nin the limits of zero and infinite correlation lengths of the random potential.\nThen, we attack the problem of finite correlation lengths. While a complex\norder parameter, which describes incommensurate Peierls chains, leads to a\nsuppression of the DOS, i.e. a pseudogap, the DOS exhibits a singularity at the\nFermi energy if the order parameter is real and therefore refers to a\ncommensurate system. We confirm these results by calculating the DOS and the\ninverse localization length for finite correlation lengths and Gaussian\nstatistics of the backscattering potential with unprecedented accuracy\nnumerically. Finally, we consider the case of classical phase fluctuations\nwhich apply to low temperatures where amplitude fluctuations are frozen out. In\nthis physically important regime, which is also characterized by finite\ncorrelation lengths, we present analytic results for the DOS, the inverse\nlocalization length, the specific heat, and the Pauli susceptibility.\n", "  Different perturbation theory treatments of the Ginzburg-Landau phase\ntransition model are discussed. This includes a criticism of the perturbative\nrenormalization group (RG) approach and a proposal of a novel method providing\ncritical exponents consistent with the known exact solutions in two dimensions.\nThe usual perturbation theory is reorganized by appropriate grouping of Feynman\ndiagrams of phi^4 model with O(n) symmetry. As a result, equations for\ncalculation of the two-point correlation function are obtained which allow to\npredict possible exact values of critical exponents in two and three dimensions\nby proving relevant scaling properties of the asymptotic solution at (and near)\nthe criticality. The new values of critical exponents are discussed and\ncompared to the results of numerical simulations and experiments.\n", "  A theory for the magnetization of ferromagnetic films is formulated within\nthe framework of many-body Green's funtion theory which considers all\ncomponents of the magnetization. The model Hamiltonian includes a Heisenberg\nterm, an external field, a second- and fourth-order uniaxial single-ion\nanisotropy, and the magnetic dipole-dipole coupling. The single-ion anisotropy\nterms can be treated exactly by introducing higher-order Green's functions and\nsubsequently taking advantage of relations between products of spin operators\nwhich leads to an automatic closure of the hierarchy of the equations of motion\nfor the Green's functions with respect to the anisotropy terms. This is an\nimprovement on the method of our previous work, which treated the corresponding\nterms only approximately by decoupling them at the level of the lowest-order\nGreen's functions. RPA-like approximations are used to decouple the exchange\nterms in both the low-order and higher-order Green's functions. As a first\nnumerical example we apply the theory to a monolayer for spin S=1 in order to\ndemonstrate the superiority of the present treatment of the anisotropy terms\nover the previous approximate decouplings.\n", "  Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we study the\nquantum coherence in one-dimensional disordered Fermi systems. We consider in\ndetail spinless fermions on a ring, and compare the influence of several kinds\nof impurities in a gapless and a dimerized, gapped system. In the\ntranslation-invariant system a so-called site-impurity, which can be realized\nby a local potential or a change of one link, increases for repulsive\ninteraction and decreases for attractive interaction. The weakening of two\nneighboring bonds, which is a realization of a so-called bond-impurity, on the\nother hand, is healed for repulsive interaction, but enhanced for intermediate\nattractive interactions. This leads to strong suppression of the quantum\ncoherence measured by the phase sensitivity, but not to localization. Adding a\nlocal distortion to a dimerized system we find that even the presence of a\nsingle site-impurity increases the metallic region found in the dimerized\nmodel. For a strong dimerization and a high barrier, an additional sharp\nmaximum, even seen for systems with about 100 sites, occurs in the phase\nsensitivity. A bond-impurity in the dimerized system also opens a small\nmetallic window in the otherwise isolating regime.\n", "  It is shown that the critical currents of high-Tc superconducting tapes\nfabricated by the coated conductor technologies are enhanced considerably if\ngrain arrangements with large effective grain boundary areas are used.\nIncreasing the aspect ratios of the grains reduces the deleterious effects of\nthe grain boundaries. A practical road to competitive high-Tc cables is\nproposed.\n", "  The results of first principles electronic structure calculations for the\nmetallic rutile and the insulating monoclinic M1 phase of vanadium dioxide are\npresented. In addition, the insulating M2 phase is investigated for the first\ntime. The density functional calculations allow for a consistent understanding\nof all three phases. In the rutile phase metallic conductivity is carried by\nmetal t_2g orbitals, which fall into the one-dimensional d_parallel band, and\nthe isotropically dispersing e_g^pi bands. Hybridization of both types of bands\nis weak. In the M1 phase splitting of the d_parallel band due to metal-metal\ndimerization and upshift of the e_g^pi bands due to increased p-d overlap lead\nto an effective separation of both types of bands. Despite incomplete opening\nof the optical band gap due to the shortcomings of the local density\napproximation, the metal-insulator transition can be understood as a\nPeierls-like instability of the d_parallel band in an embedding background of\ne_g^pi electrons. In the M2 phase, the metal-insulator transition arises as a\ncombined embedded Peierls-like and antiferromagnetic instability. The results\nfor VO2 fit into the general scenario of an instability of the rutile-type\ntransition-metal dioxides at the beginning of the d-series towards dimerization\nor antiferromagnetic ordering within the characteristic metal chains. This\nscenario was successfully applied before to MoO2 and NbO2. In the d^1\ncompounds, the d_parallel and e_g^pi bands can be completely separated, which\nleads to the observed metal-insulator transitions.\n", "  A pyrochlore lattice is considered where the average electron number of\nelectrons per site is half--integer, concentrating on the case of exactly half\nan electron per site. Strong on-site repulsions are assumed, so that all sites\nare either empty or singly occupied. Where there are in addition strong\nnearest--neighbour repulsions, a tetrahedron rule comes into effect, as\npreviously suggested for magnetite. We show that in this case, there exist\nexcitations with fractional charge (+/-) e/2. These are intimately connected\nwith the high degeneracy of the ground state in the absence of kinetic energy\nterms. When an additional electron is inserted into the system, it decays into\ntwo point like excitations with charge -e/2, connected by a Heisenberg spin\nchain which carries the electron's spin.\n", "  The distribution of scattering delay times is analyzed for classical\nelectrons which are transmitted through a finite waveguide. For non-zero\nmagnetic field the distribution shows a regular pattern of maxima (logarithmic\nsingularities). Although their location follows from a simple commensurability\ncondition, there is no straightforward geometric explanation of this\nself-pulsing effect. Rather it can be understood as a time-dependent analog of\ntransverse magnetic focusing, in terms of the stationary points of the delay\ntime. We also discuss the possibility of singularities in the delay-time\ndistribution for generic 2D scattering systems.\n", "  Networks of random quantum scatterers (S-matrices) form paradigmatic models\nfor the propagation of coherent waves in random S-matrix network models cover\nuniversal localization-delocalization properties and have some advantages over\nmore traditional Hamiltonian models. In particular, a straightforward\nimplementation of real space renormalization techniques is possible. Starting\nfrom a finite elementary cell of the S-matrix network, hierarchical network\nmodels can be constructed by recursion. The localization-delocalization\nproperties are contained in the flow of the forward scattering strength\n('conductance') under increasing system size. With the aid of 'small scale'\nnumerics qualitative aspects of the localization-delocalization properties of\nS-matrix network models can be worked out.\n", "  The spectra which occur in numerical density-matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) calculations for quantum chains can be obtained analytically for\nintegrable models via corner transfer matrices. This is shown in detail for the\ntransverse Ising chain and the uniaxial XXZ Heisenberg model and explains in\nparticular their exponential character in these cases.\n", "  We have studied the appearance of chaos in the many-body spectrum of\ninteracting Fermions. The coupling of a single state to the Fermi sea is\nconsidered. This state is coupled to a hierarchy of states corresponding to one\nor several particle-hole excitations. We have considered various couplings\nbetween two successive generations of this hierarchy and determined under which\nconditions this coupling can lead to Wigner-Dyson correlations. We have found\nthat the cross-over from a Poisson to a Wigner distribution is characterized\nnot only by the ratio $V/\\Delta_c$, but also by the ratio $\\Delta_c/\\delta$.\n$V$ is the typical interaction matrix element, $\\delta$ is the energy distance\nbetween {\\it many-body} states and $\\Delta_c$ is the distance between many-body\nstates coupled by the interaction.\n", "  We investigate numerically the influence of Dirichlet boundary conditions on\nthe nearest neighbor level spacing distribution $P(s)$ of a two-dimensional\ndisordered tight-binding model in the presence of a strong perpendicular\nmagnetic field. From the calculation of the second moment of $P(s)$ it is shown\nthat for Dirichlet boundary conditions, due to the presence of edge states, the\nposition of the critical energy shifts with increasing system size to the\nlocation of the critical energy for periodic boundary conditions. An\nextrapolation to infinite system size results in different critical (scale\nindependent) $P(s)$ distributions for periodic and Dirichlet boundary\nconditions.\n", "  The level spacing distribution is numerically calculated at the\ndisorder-induced metal--insulator transition for dimensionality d=4 by applying\nthe Lanczos diagonalisation. The critical level statistics are shown to deviate\nstronger from the result of the random matrix theory compared to those of d=3\nand to become closer to the Poisson limit of uncorrelated spectra. Using the\nfinite size scaling analysis for the probability distribution Q_n(E) of having\nn levels in a given energy interval E we find the critical disorder W_c = 34.5\n\\pm 0.5, the correlation length exponent \\nu = 1.1 \\pm 0.2 and the critical\nspectral compressibility k_c \\approx 0.5.\n", "  Using a fermionic version of the Lax pair formulation, we construct an\nintegrable small-polaron model with general open boundary conditions. The Lax\npair and the boundary supermatrices $K_{\\pm}$ for the model are obtained. This\nprovides a direct proof of the integrability of the model.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of the thermoelectric power [S] in disordered\nsystems close to the Anderson-type metal-insulator transition [MIT] at low\ntemperatures. In the literature, we find contradictory results for S. It is\neither argued to diverge or to remain a constant as the MIT is approached. To\nresolve this dilemma, we calculate the number density of electrons at the MIT\nin disordered systems using an averaged density of states obtained by\ndiagonalizing the three-dimensional Anderson model of localization. From the\nnumber density we obtain the temperature dependence of the chemical potential\nnecessary to solve for S. Without any additional approximation, we use the\nChester-Thellung-Kubo-Greenwood formulation and numerically obtain the behavior\nof S at low T as the Anderson transition is approached from the metallic side.\nWe show that indeed S does not diverge.\n", "  We have calculated wave functions and matrix elements of the dipole operator\nin the two- and three-dimensional Anderson model of localization and have\nstudied their statistical properties in the limit of weak disorder. In\nparticular, we have considered two cases. First, we have studied the\nfluctuations as an external Aharonov-Bohm flux is varied. Second, we have\nconsidered the influence of incipient localization. In both cases, the\nstatistical properties of the eigenfunctions are non-trivial, in that the joint\nprobability distribution function of eigenvalues and eigenvectors does no\nlonger factorize. We report on detailed comparisons with analytical results,\nobtained within the non-linear sigma model and/or the semiclassical approach.\n", "  Recently, a metal-insulator transition (MIT) was found in the anisotropic\nAnderson model of localization by transfer-matrix methods (TMM). This MIT has\nbeen also investigated by multifractal analysis (MFA) and the same critical\ndisorders $W_c$ have been obtained within the accuracy of the data. We now\nemploy energy level statistics (ELS) to further characterize the MIT. We find a\ncrossover of the nearest-neighbor level spacing distribution $P(s)$ from GOE\nstatistics at small disorder indicating metallic behavior to the Poisson\ndistribution at large disorder characteristic for localized states. An analysis\nof the system size dependence of the spectral rigidity $\\Delta_3(L)$ confirms\nthe values of $W_c$ from TMM and MFA.\n", "  Networks generated from Voronoi tessellations of space are prototypes for\ntopologically disordered systems. In order to assess the effects of random\ncoordination on the statistical properties of energy spectra, we analyze\ntight-binding models for planar topologically disordered systems. To this end,\nthe networks are generated by a simple topological model covering a wide range\nof naturally observed random structures. We find that the energy-level-spacing\ndistributions exhibit level repulsion, similar to the spacings in the\nenergetically disordered Anderson model of localization in the metallic regime.\n", "  We report large-scale simulations of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson\nIsing spin glass system using the recently introduced multi-overlap Monte Carlo\nalgorithm. In this approach the temperature is fixed and two replica are\ncoupled through a weight factor such that a broad distribution of the Parisi\noverlap parameter $q$ is achieved. Canonical expectation values for the entire\n$q$-range (multi-overlap) follow by reweighting. We present an analysis of the\nperformance of the algorithm and in particular discuss results on spin glass\nfree-energy barriers which are hard to obtain with conventional algorithms. In\naddition we discuss the non-trivial scaling behavior of the canonical\n$q$-distributions in the broken phase.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of the properties of low-dimensional\nquantum antiferromagnets in applied magnetic fields. In a nonlinear sigma model\ndescription, we use a spin stiffness analysis, a 1/N expansion, and a\nrenormalization group approach to describe the broken-symmetry regimes of\nfinite magnetization, and, in cases of most interest, a low-field regime where\nsymmetry is restored by quantum fluctuations. We compute the magnetization,\ncritical fields, spin correlation functions, and decay exponents accessible by\nnuclear magnetic resonance experiments. The model is relevant to many systems\nexhibiting Haldane physics, and provides good agreement with data for the\ntwo-chain spin ladder compound CuHpCl.\n", "  The concept of conformal field theory provides a general classification of\nstatistical systems on two-dimensional geometries at the point of a continuous\nphase transition. Considering the finite-size scaling of certain special\nobservables, one thus obtains not only the critical exponents but even the\ncorresponding amplitudes of the divergences analytically. A first numerical\nanalysis brought up the question whether analogous results can be obtained for\nthose systems on three-dimensional manifolds.\n  Using Monte Carlo simulations based on the Wolff single-cluster update\nalgorithm we investigate the scaling properties of O(n) symmetric classical\nspin models on a three-dimensional, hyper-cylindrical geometry with a toroidal\ncross-section considering both periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions.\nStudying the correlation lengths of the Ising, the XY, and the Heisenberg\nmodel, we find strong evidence for a scaling relation analogous to the\ntwo-dimensional case, but in contrast here for the systems with antiperiodic\nboundary conditions.\n", "  For intermediate Coulomb energy to Fermi energy ratios $r_s$, spinless\nfermions in a two-dimensional random potential form a new quantum phase,\ndifferent from the Fermi glass (weakly interacting Anderson localized states)\nand the Wigner crystal (regular array of charges pinned by the disorder). The\nintermediate phase is characterized by an ordered flow of persistent currents\nwith a typical value decreasing with excitation energy. Extending finite size\nscaling analysis to the many body ground state, we find that electron-electron\ninteractions can drive the Fermi glass towards an intermediate metallic phase\n(Coulomb metal).\n", "  The Anderson transitions in a random magnetic field in three dimensions are\ninvestigated numerically. The critical behavior near the transition point is\nanalyzed in detail by means of the transfer matrix method with high accuracy\nfor systems both with and without an additional random scalar potential. We\nfind the critical exponent $\\nu$ for the localization length to be $1.45 \\pm\n0.09$ with a strong random scalar potential. Without it, the exponent is\nsmaller but increases with the system sizes and extrapolates to the above value\nwithin the error bars. These results support the conventional classification of\nuniversality classes due to symmetry. Fractal dimensionality of the wave\nfunction at the critical point is also estimated by the equation-of-motion\nmethod.\n", "  The concept of a disordered Fermi-liquid fixed point is introduced and used\nto understand various properties of disordered metals within a unifying\nframework. Corrections to scaling near this fixed point give what are commonly\ncalled weak-localization effects. Various instabilities of the disordered\nFermi-liquid phase are discussed. These include two distinct types of\nsuperconducting-to-normal-metal quantum phase transitions. First, the quantum\nphase transition from a disordered metal to a conventional superconductor in\nbulk materials is considered. Second, a quantum phase transition in two\ndimensions from metallic-like behavior to a novel type of disorder induced,\nspin-triplet, even parity, superconductivity is treated. The paper is concluded\nwith a discussion of the nature of the ground state of two-dimensional,\ndisordered electron systems.\n", "  We investigate the quantum phase transition of itinerant ferromagnets. It is\nshown that correlation effects in the underlying itinerant electron system lead\nto singularities in the order parameter field theory that result in an\neffective long-range interaction between the spin fluctuations. This\ninteraction turns out to be generically {\\em antiferromagnetic} for clean\nsystems. In disordered systems analogous correlation effects lead to even\nstronger singularities. The resulting long-range interaction is, however,\ngenerically ferromagnetic.\n  We discuss two possibilities for the ferromagnetic quantum phase transition.\nIn clean systems, the transition is generically of first order, as is\nexperimentally observed in MnSi. However, under certain conditions the\ntransition may be continuous with non-mean field critical behavior. In\ndisordered systems, one finds a very rich phase diagram showing first order and\ncontinuous phase transitions and several multicritical points.\n", "  We study the effect of electron-electron interaction on a two dimensional\n(2D) disordered lattice. For the case of two electrons the analytical estimates\nare presented showing a transition from localized to delocalized states in a\nway similar to the Anderson transition in 3D. The localized phase corresponds\nto large values of the parameter r_s, which is determined by the ratio of the\nCoulomb and Fermi energies. The numerical investigations of the spectral\nstatistics P(s) in a system with up to N_p=30 spin polarized electrons show the\ntransition from the Poisson to the Wigner-Dyson distribution at a total\nelectron energy independent of N_p. The relation to experiments on the\nmetal-insulator transition in 2D is also discussed.\n", "  We determine analytically the distribution of conductances of quasi\none-dimensional disordered electron systems, neglecting electron-electron\ninteraction, for all strengths of disorder. We find that in the crossover\nregion between the metallic and insulating regimes, P(g) is highly asymmetric,\ngiven by ``one-sided'' log-normal distribution. For larger disorder, the tail\nof the log-normal distribution is cut-off for g > 1 by a Gaussian.\n", "  What is the lowest temperature to which one can trace the growth of the\ndephasing time in low-dimensional conductors? I consider the fundamental\nlimitation, the crossover from weak to strong localization, as well as several\nexperimental reasons for frequently observed saturation of the dephasing time\n(hot-electron effects, dephasing by external noise). Recent progress in our\nunderstanding of the electron-phonon interaction in disordered conductors is\nalso briefly discussed.\n", "  Critical states are studied by a real space RG in the problem with strong\ndiagonal disorder and long range power law hopping. The RG flow of the\ndistribution of coupling parameters is characterized by a family of non-trivial\nfix points. We consider the RG flow of the distribution of participation ratios\nof eigenstates. Scaling of participation ratios is sensitive to the nature of\nthe RG fix point. For some fix points, scaling of participation ratios is\ncharacterized by a distribution of exponents, rather than by a single exponent.\n  The RG method can be generalized to treat certain fermionic Hamiltonians with\ndisorder and long range hopping. We derive the RG for a model of interacting\ntwo-level systems. Besides couplings, in this problem the RG includes the\ndensity of states. The density of states is renormalized so that it develops a\nsingularity near zero energy.\n", "  Much evidence has been collected to date which shows that repulsive\nelectron-electron interaction can lead to the formation of particle pairs in a\none-dimensional random energy landscape. The localization length \\lambda_2 of\nthese pair states is finite, but larger than the localization length \\lambda_1\nof the individual particles. After a short review of previous work, we present\nnumerical evidence for this effect based on an analysis of the interaction\nmatrix elements and an application of the decimation method. The results based\non the decimation method for a two-dimensional disordered medium support the\nlocalization-delocalization transition of pair states predicted recently.\n", "  The density of states of Dirac fermions with a random mass on a\ntwo-dimensional lattice is considered. We give the explicit asymptotic form of\nthe single-electron density of states as a function of both energy and\n(average) Dirac mass, in the regime where all states are localized. We make use\nof a weak-disorder expansion in the parameter g/m^2, where g is the strength of\ndisorder and m the average Dirac mass for the case in which the evaluation of\nthe (supersymmetric) integrals corresponds to non-uniform solutions of the\nsaddle point equation. The resulting density of states has tails which deviate\nfrom the typical pure Gaussian form by an analytic prefactor.\n", "  Using Raman spectroscopy and transport measurements we investigate thin\nepitaxial films of Y{1-x}(Pr,Ca)xBa2Cu3O{6+y}. We explore the electronic Raman\nresponses obtained after subtraction of phononic excitations, and the 2Delta\npeaks that form out of the electronic background below Tc. We find that the\nenergy of the B1g 2Delta peak increases monotonically with decreasing doping\nuntil the peaks become unresolvable. In contrast, the peaks in A1g symmetry\nfollow Tc being resolvable in the Pr-doped films. The B2g responses are weak\nand a 2Delta peak is only detected at the highest doping level. As a\nconsequence of strong electron-phonon coupling, the B1g phonon at 340 cm^-1\nexhibits a pronounced Fano-type line shape. We use a phenomenological model to\ndescribe the line shape that takes into account real and imaginary part of the\nelectronic response. It allows us to obtain the self-energy corrections and the\nmass- enhancement factor lambda as a measure of the coupling. In the normal\nstate we find lambda=0.015 around optimal doping and decreasing values with\ndecreasing doping. The electron-phonon coupling increases strongly below T_c in\noverdoped samples in which the B1g 2Delta peaks appear in the vicinity of the\nphonon. Self-energy effects observed in the superconducting state can only\npartly be assigned to the redistributing electronic response. Anomalies with\nrespect to frequency, linewidth, and intensity remain. They appear at\nincreasing tempera- tures with decreasing doping and we provide evidence that\nthey are connected to the presence of the pseudogap. We supplement our study by\na comparison with single crystal data and investigate the influence of\nsite-substitutional disorder on the electronic response and the electron-phonon\ninteraction.\n", "  The spectra of Sinai microwave billiards and rectangular billiards with\nstatistically distributed circular scatterers have been taken as a function of\nthe position of one wall, and of one of the scatterers, respectively. Whereas\nin the first case the velocity distribution and correlations obey the universal\nbehaviour predicted by Simons and Altshuler, in the second case a completely\ndifferent behaviour is observed. This is due to the fact that a shift of one\nwall changes the wave function globally whereas the displacement of one\nscatterer only leads to a local perturbance.\n", "  The geometric theory of vortex tunnelling in superfluid liquids is developed.\nGeometry rules the tunnelling process in the approximation of an incompressible\nsuperfluid, which yields the identity of phase and configuration space in the\nvortex collective co-ordinate. To exemplify the implications of this approach\nto tunnelling, we solve explicitly for the two-dimensional motion of a point\nvortex in the presence of an ellipse, showing that the hydrodynamic collective\nco-ordinate description limits the constant energy paths allowed for the vortex\nin configuration space. We outline the experimental procedure used in helium II\nto observe tunnelling events, and compare the conclusions we draw to the\nexperimental results obtained so far. Tunnelling in Fermi superfluids is\ndiscussed, where it is assumed that the low energy quasiparticle excitations\nlocalised in the vortex core govern the vortex dynamical equations. The\ntunnelling process can be dominated by Hall or dissipative terms, respectively\nbe under the influence of both, with a possible realization of this last\nintermediate case in unconventional, high-temperature superconductors.\n", "  Quantum phase transitions occur at zero temperature when some non-thermal\ncontrol-parameter like pressure or chemical composition is changed. They are\ndriven by quantum rather than thermal fluctuations. In this review we first\ngive a pedagogical introduction to quantum phase transitions and quantum\ncritical behavior emphasizing similarities with and differences to classical\nthermal phase transitions. We then illustrate the general concepts by\ndiscussing a few examples of quantum phase transitions occurring in electronic\nsystems. The ferromagnetic transition of itinerant electrons shows a very rich\nbehavior since the magnetization couples to additional electronic soft modes\nwhich generates an effective long-range interaction between the spin\nfluctuations. We then consider the influence of rare regions on quantum phase\ntransitions in systems with quenched disorder, taking the antiferromagnetic\ntransitions of itinerant electrons as a primary example. Finally we discuss\nsome aspects of the metal-insulator transition in the presence of quenched\ndisorder and interactions.\n", "  A review of recent progress in numerical studies of the Anderson transition\nin three dimensional systems is presented. From high precision calculations the\ncritical exponent $\\nu$ for the divergence of the localization length is\nestimated to be $\\nu=1.57\\pm 0.02$ for the orthogonal universality class, which\nis clearly distinguished from $\\nu=1.43\\pm 0.03$ for the unitary universality\nclass. The boundary condition dependences of some quantities at the Anderson\ntransition are also discussed.\n", "  We discuss the recent experiments on persistent current in metallic rings in\nthe backdrop of low temperature decoherence. The observed size of the\npersistent current, typically on the order of the Thouless energy, $ e/\\tau_D$,\nis much larger than the theoretical results, obtained with or without electron\ninteraction. In considering the phenomenology of both decoherence and\npersistent current, usually observed in similar systems, we argue towards a\ndynamic role played by decoherence in the generation of a persistent current. A\nfield-induced phase shift from near-equilibrium high-frequency\nfluctuations---which otherwise gives rise to decoherence---under certain\nconditions of periodicity and asymmetry due to disorder, is argued to induce a\nsteady state diffusion current on the order of $e/\\tau_D$, comparable to the\nobserved persistent current.\n", "  In this paper we present our point of view on correct physical interpretation\nof the Bel-Robinson tensor within the framework of the standard General\nRelativity ({\\bf GR}), i.e., within the framework of the {\\bf GR} without\nsupplementary elements like arbitrary vector field, distinguished tetrads field\nor second metric. We show that this tensor arises as a consequence of the\nBianchi identities and, in a natural manner, it is linked to the differences of\nthe canonical gravitational energy-momentum calculated in normal coordinates\n{\\bf NC(P)}.\n", "  The orbital dynamics of the binary point-mass systems is ambiguous at the\nthird post-Newtonian order of approximation. The static ambiguity is known to\nbe related to the difference between the Brill-Lindquist solution and the\nMisner-Lindquist solution of the time-symmetric conformally flat initial value\nproblem for binary black holes. The kinetic ambiguity is noticed to violate in\ngeneral the standard relation between the center-of-mass velocity and the total\nlinear momentum as demanded by global Lorentz invariance.\n", "  Five classes of radiative solutions of Einstein's field equations are\ndiscussed in the light of some new developments. These are plane waves and\ntheir collisions, cylindrical waves, Robinson-Trautman and type N spacetimes,\nboost-rotation symmetric spacetimes and generalized Gowdy-type cosmological\nmodels\n", "  The Proca wave equation describes a classical massive spin 1 particle. We\nanalyze the gravitational interaction of this vector field. In particular, the\nspherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Proca coupled system are\nobtained numerically. Although at infinity the metric field approaches the\nusual Schwarzschild (Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om) limit, we demonstrate the absence of\nblack hole type configurations.\n", "  Even when the Higgs particle is finally detected, it will continue to be a\nlegitimate question to ask whether the inertia of matter as a reaction force\nopposing acceleration is an intrinsic or extrinsic property of matter. General\nrelativity specifies which geodesic path a free particle will follow, but\ngeometrodynamics has no mechanism for generating a reaction force for deviation\nfrom geodesic motion. We discuss a different approach involving the\nelectromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF) of the quantum vacuum. It has been found\nthat certain asymmetries arise in the ZPF as perceived from an accelerating\nreference frame. In such a frame the Poynting vector and momentum flux of the\nZPF become non-zero. Scattering of this quantum radiation by the quarks and\nelectrons in matter can result in an acceleration-dependent reaction force.\nBoth the ordinary and the relativistic forms of Newton's second law, the\nequation of motion, can be derived from the electrodynamics of such\nZPF-particle interactions. Conjectural arguments are given why this interaction\nshould take place in a resonance at the Compton frequency, and how this could\nsimultaneously provide a physical basis for the de Broglie wavelength of a\nmoving particle. This affords a suggestive perspective on a deep connection\nbetween electrodynamics, the origin of inertia and the quantum wave nature of\nmatter.\n", "  We consider self-interacting, perturbative quantum field theory in a curved\nspacetime background with a Killing vector field. We show that the action of\nthis spacetime symmetry on interacting field operators can be implemented by a\nNoether charge which arises as a surface integral over the time-component of\nthe interacting Noether current-density associated with the Killing field. The\nproof of this involves the demonstration of a corresponding set of Ward\nidentities. Our work is based on the perturbative construction by Brunetti and\nFredenhagen (Commun.Math.Phys. 208 (2000) 623-661) of self-interacting quantum\nfield theories in general globally hyperbolic spacetimes.\n", "  Torsion appears in literature in quite different forms. Generally, spin is\nconsidered to be the source of torsion, but there are several other\npossibilities in which torsion emerges in different contexts. In some cases a\nphenomenological counterpart is absent, in some other cases torsion arises from\nsources without spin as a gradient of a scalar field. Accordingly, we propose\ntwo classification schemes. The first one is based on the possibility to\nconstruct torsion tensors from the product of a covariant bivector and a vector\nand their respective space-time properties. The second one is obtained by\nstarting from the decomposition of torsion into three irreducible pieces. Their\nspace-time properties again lead to a complete classification. The\nclassifications found are given in a U_4, a four dimensional space-time where\nthe torsion tensors have some peculiar properties. The irreducible\ndecomposition is useful since most of the phenomenological work done for\ntorsion concerns four dimensional cosmological models. In the second part of\nthe paper two applications of these classification schemes are given. The\nmodifications of energy-momentum tensors are considered that arise due to\ndifferent sources of torsion. Furthermore, we analyze the contributions of\ntorsion to shear, vorticity, expansion and acceleration. Finally the\ngeneralized Raychaudhuri equation is discussed.\n", "  In the paper we show that the real gravitational waves which have\n$R_{iklm}\\not= 0$ always carry energy-momentum and angular momentum. Our proof\nuses canonical superenergy and supermomentum tensors for gravitational field.\n", "  The characteristics of the memory of accelerated motion in Minkowski\nspacetime are discussed within the framework of the nonlocal theory of\naccelerated observers. Two types of memory are distinguished: kinetic and\ndynamic. We show that only kinetic memory is acceptable, since dynamic memory\nleads to divergences for nonuniform accelerated motion.\n", "  We investigate the limitations of length measurements by accelerated\nobservers in Minkowski spacetime brought about via the hypothesis of locality,\nnamely, the assumption that an accelerated observer at each instant is\nequivalent to an otherwise identical momentarily comoving inertial observer. We\nfind that consistency can be achieved only in a rather limited neighborhood\naround the observer with linear dimensions that are negligibly small compared\nto the characteristic acceleration length of the observer.\n", "  We discuss gravitomagnetism in connection with rotating cylindrical systems.\nIn particular, the gravitomagnetic clock effect is investigated for the\nexterior vacuum field of an infinite rotating cylinder. The dependence of the\nclock effect on the Weyl parameters of the stationary Lewis metric is\ndetermined. We illustrate our results by means of the van Stockum spacetime.\n", "  Similarily as in the Ashtekar approach, the translational Chern-Simons term\nis, as a generating function, instrumental for a chiral reformulation of simple\n(N=1) supergravity. After applying the algebraic Cartan relation between spin\nand torsion, the resulting canonical transformation induces not only\ndecomposition of the gravitational fields into selfdual and antiselfdual modes,\nbut also a splitting of the Rarita-Schwinger fields into their chiral parts in\na natural way. In some detail, we also analyze the consequences for axial and\nchiral anomalies.\n", "  Generalizing previous quantum gravity results for Schwarzschild black holes\nfrom 4 to D > 3 space-time dimensions yields an energy spectrum E_n = alpha\nn^{(D-3)/(D-2)} E_P, n=1,2,..., alpha = O(1), where E_P is the Planck energy in\nthat space-time. This spectrum means that the quantized area A_{D-2}(n) of the\nD-2 dimensional horizon has universally the form A_{D-2} = n a_{D-2}, where\na_{D-2} is essentially the (D-2)th power of the D-dimensional Planck length.\nAssuming that the basic area quantum has a Z(2)-degeneracy according to its two\npossible orientation degrees of freedom implies a degeneracy d_n = 2^n for the\nn-th level. The energy spectrum with such a degeneracy leads to a quantum\ncanonical partition function which is the same as the classical grand canonical\npartition function of a primitive Ising droplet nucleation model for 1st-order\nphase transitions in D-2 spatial dimensions. The analogy to this model suggests\nthat E_n represents the surface energy of a \"droplet\" of n horizon quanta.\nExploiting the well-known properties of the so-called critical droplets of that\nmodel immediately leads to the Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein-Hawking\nentropy of Schwarzschild black holes. The values of temperature and entropy\nappear closely related to the imaginary part of the partition function which\ndescribes metastable states\n", "  The arena normally used in black holes thermodynamics was recently\ngeneralized to incorporate a broad class of physically interesting situations.\nThe key idea is to replace the notion of stationary event horizons by that of\n`isolated horizons.' Unlike event horizons, isolated horizons can be located in\na space-time quasi-locally. Furthermore, they need not be Killing horizons. In\nparticular, a space-time representing a black hole which is itself in\nequilibrium, but whose exterior contains radiation, admits an isolated horizon.\nIn spite of this generality, the zeroth and first laws of black hole mechanics\nextend to isolated horizons. Furthermore, by carrying out a systematic,\nnon-perturbative quantization, one can explore the quantum geometry of isolated\nhorizons and account for their entropy from statistical mechanical\nconsiderations. After a general introduction to black hole thermodynamics as a\nwhole, these recent developments are briefly summarized.\n", "  We first present a review, intended for classical relativists, of the\nultraviolet difficulties faced by local quantum gravity theories in both the\nusual Einstein versions and in their supergravity extensions, at least\nperturbatively. These problems, present in arbitrary dimensions, are traceable\nto the dimensionality of the Einstein constant. We then summarize very recent\nresults about supergravity at the highest allowed dimension, D=11, showing that\nalso this unique model suffers from infinities already at 2 loops, despite its\nhigh degree of supersymmetry. The conclusion is that there is no viable\nnonghost quantum field model that includes general relativity.\n", "  We discuss how asymptotic quantities, originally introduced on null infinity\nin terms of Bondi-type gauge conditions, can be calculated near space-like\ninfinity to any desired precision.\n", "  The various schemes for studying rigidly rotating perfect fluids in general\nrelativity are reviewed. General conclusions one may draw from these are: (i)\nThere is a need to restrict the scope of the possible ansatze, and (ii) the\nangular behaviour is a valuable commodity. This latter observation follows from\na large number of analytic models exhibiting a NUT-like behaviour. A method of\ngetting around problem (ii) is presented on a simple example. To alleviate\nproblem (i) for rigidly rotating perfect fluids, approximation schemes based on\na series expansion in the angular velocity are suggested. A pioneering work,\ndue to Hartle, explores the global properties of matched space-times to\nquadratic order in the angular velocity.\n  As a first example of the applications, it is shown that the rigidly rotating\nincompressible fluid cannot be Petrov type D.\n", "  Numerical relativity is finally approaching a state where the evolution of\nrather general (3+1)-dimensional data sets can be computed in order to solve\nthe Einstein equations. After a general introduction, three topics of current\ninterest are briefly reviewed: binary black hole mergers, the evolution of\nstrong gravitational waves, and shift conditions for neutron star binaries.\n", "  Exact solutions of Einstein's equations in 2+1-dimensional anti-de Sitter\nspace containing any number of black holes are described. In addition to the\nblack holes these spacetimes can possess ``internal'' structure. Accordingly\nthe generic spacetime of this type depends on a large number of parameters.\nHalf of these can be taken as mass parameters, and the rest as the conjugate\n(angular) momenta. The time development and horizon structure of some of these\nspacetimes are sketched.\n", "  The evidence for non-vanishing neutrino masses from solar and atmospheric\nneutrinos provides the first solid hint towards physics beyond the standard\nmodel. A full reconstruction of the neutrino spectrum may well provide a key to\nthe theoretical structures underlying the standard model such as supersymmetry,\ngrand unification or extra space dimensions. In this article we discuss the\nimpact of absolute neutrinos masses on physics beyond the standard model. We\nreview the information obtained from neutrino oscillation data and discuss the\nprospects of the crucial determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale, as\nwell as the intriguing connection with the Z-burst model for extreme-energy\ncosmic rays.\n", "  It is shown how the the introduction of a suitably defined dilatonic\nauxiliary field, $\\Phi$ say, makes it possible for the non-linear Lagrangian\nfor a generic elastic string model, of the kind appropriate for representing\nsuperconducting cosmic strings, to be converted into a standardised form as the\nsum of a kinetic term that is just homogeneously quadratic in the relevant\nscalar phase gradient (as in a simple linear model) together with a potential\nenergy term, $V$ say, that is specified as a generically non-linear function of\n$\\Phi$. The explicit form of this function is derived for various noteworthy\nexamples, of which the most memorable is that of the transonic string model, as\ncharacterised by a given mass scale, $m$ say, for which this potential energy\ndensity will be expressible in terms of the zero current limit value\n$\\Phi_{_0}$ of $\\Phi$ by $ V= {1\\over 2} m \\big(\\Phi_{_0}^{-2} \\Phi^2+\n\\Phi_{_0}^{2} \\Phi^{-2} \\big)$.\n", "  This is a review of the constrained dynamical structure of Poincare gauge\ntheory which concentrates on the basic canonical and gauge properties of the\ntheory, including the identification of constraints, gauge symmetries and\nconservation laws. As an interesting example of the general approach we discuss\nthe teleparallel formulation of general relativity.\n", "  In this paper, two things are done. (i) Using cohomological techniques, we\nexplore the consistent deformations of linearized conformal gravity in 4\ndimensions. We show that the only possibility involving no more than 4\nderivatives of the metric (i.e., terms of the form $\\partial^4 g_{\\mu \\nu}$,\n$\\partial^3 g_{\\mu \\nu} \\partial g_{\\alpha \\beta}$, $\\partial^2 g_{\\mu \\nu}\n\\partial^2g_{\\alpha \\beta}$, $\\partial^2 g_{\\mu \\nu} \\partial g_{\\alpha \\beta}\n\\partial g_{\\rho \\sigma}$ or $\\partial g_{\\mu \\nu} \\partial g_{\\alpha \\beta}\n\\partial g_{\\rho \\sigma} \\partial g_{\\gamma \\delta}$ with coefficients that\ninvolve undifferentiated metric components - or terms with less derivatives) is\ngiven by the Weyl action $\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g} W_{\\a\\b\\g\\d} W^{\\a\\b\\g\\d}$, in\nmuch the same way as the Einstein-Hilbert action describes the only consistent\nmanner to make a Pauli-Fierz massless spin-2 field self-interact with no more\nthan 2 derivatives. No a priori requirement of invariance under diffeomorphisms\nis imposed: this follows automatically from consistency. (ii) We then turn to\n\"multi-Weyl graviton\" theories. We show the impossibility to introduce\ncross-interactions between the different types of Weyl gravitons if one\nrequests that the action reduces, in the free limit, to a sum of linearized\nWeyl actions. However, if different free limits are authorized, cross-couplings\nbecome possible. An explicit example is given. We discuss also how the results\nextend to other spacetime dimensions.\n", "  Consistent couplings between a set of vector fields and a system of matter\nfields are analysed in the framework of Lagrangian BRST cohomology.\n", "  This is the full text of a survey talk for nonspecialists, delivered at the\n66th Annual Meeting of the German Physical Society in Leipzig, March 2002. We\nhave not taken pains to suppress the colloquial style. References are given\nonly insofar as they help to underline the points made; this is not a\nfull-blooded survey. The connection between noncommutative field theory and\nstring theory is mentioned, but deemphasized. Contributions to noncommutative\ngeometry made in Germany are emphasized.\n", "  A relevant part of the quantum algebra of observables for the closed bosonic\nstrings moving in 1+3-dimensional Minkowski space is presented in the form of\ngenerating relations involving still one, as yet undetermined, real free\nparameter.\n", "  The quantum algebra of observables postulated in hep-th/9805057 is\nconstructed up to degree five. All independent relations of degree four are\ngiven; they involve three as yet undetermined parameters. Definitions and\nsymbols are used as introduced in the above-mentioned article.\n", "  We apply the antifield quantization method of Batalin and Vilkovisky to the\ncalculation of the path integral for the Poisson-Sigma model in a general\ngauge. For a linear Poisson structure the model reduces to a nonabelian gauge\ntheory, and we obtain the formula for the partition function of two-dimensional\nYang-Mills theory for closed two-dimensional manifolds.\n", "  A formula describing finite renormalizations is derived in the Epstein-Glaser\nformalism and an explicit calculation of finite counterterms in $\\Phi\n^4$-theory is performed. The Zimmermann identities and the action principle for\nchanges of parameters in the interaction are presented independent of the\nadiabatic limit.\n", "  I review some recent work (done in collaboration with G. Veneziano) which\nclarifies the existence of a correspondence between self-gravitating\nfundamental string states and Schwarzschild black holes. The main result is a\ndetailed calculation showing that self-gravity causes a typical string state of\nmass M to shrink, as the string coupling g^2 increases, down to a compact\nstring state whose mass, size, entropy and luminosity match (for the critical\nvalue g_c^2 = (M sqrt{alpha'})^{-1}) those of a Schwarzschild black hole. This\nconfirms the idea that the entropy of black holes can be accounted for by\ncounting string states, and suggests that the level spacing of the quantum\nstates of Schwarzschild black holes is exponentially small, and very much\nblurred by radiative effects.\n", "  We give an introduction to the techniques from microlocal analysis that have\nsuccessfully been applied in the investigation of Hadamard states of free\nquantum field theories on curved spacetimes. The calculation of the wave front\nset of the two point function of the free Klein-Gordon field in a Hadamard\nstate is reviewed, and the polarization set of a Hadamard two point function of\nthe free Dirac field on a curved spacetime is calculated.\n", "  Tunnelling transit time for a frustrated total internal reflection in a\ndouble-prism experiment was measured using microwave radiation. We have found\nthat the transit time is of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding\ntransit time measured either in an undersized waveguide (evanescent modes) or\nin a photonic lattice. Moreover we have established that in all such\nexperiments the tunnelling transit time is approximately equal to the\nreciprocal 1/f of the corresponding frequency of radiation.\n", "  The paper elucidates the physical basis of experimental results on\nsuperluminal signal velocity. It will be made plausible that superluminal\nsignals do not violate the principle of causality but they can shorten the\nluminal vacuum time span between cause and effect. This amazing behaviour is\nbased on the property that any physical signal has a finite duration.\n", "  We discuss applications of the quantile concept of trajectories and\nvelocities to the propagation of electromagnetic signals in wave guides of\nvarying cross section. Quantile motion is a general description of the\ntransport properties of measurable conserved quantities in quantum mechanics as\nwell as in classical electrodynamics. In the latter case we consider the\nquantile motion of electromagnetic energy as the direct result of a physical\nmeasurement. In this sense the quantile velocity corresponds to the\nelectromagnetic signal velocity also in the presence of barriers and\ninhomogeneities in the medium of propagation. We show that this signal velocity\nis always smaller than the speed of light in vacuum. Using numerical examples\nwe demonstrate how typical wave phenomena can be described in terms of the\nquantile motion.\n", "  It recently has been demonstrated that signals conveyed by evanescent modes\ncan travel faster than light. In this report some special features of signals\nare introduced and investigated, for instance the fundamental property that\nsignals are frequency band limited.\n  Evanescent modes are characterized by extraordinary properties: Their energy\nis {\\it negative}, they are not directly measurable, and the evanescent region\nis not causal since the modes traverse this region instantaneously. The study\ndemonstrates the necessity of quantum mechanical principles in order to\ninterprete the superluminal signal velocity of classical evanescent modes.\n", "  Past, present and future experimental tests of quantum nonlocality are\ndiscussed. Consequences of assuming that the state-vector collapse is a real\nphysical phenomenon in space-time are developed. These lead to experiments\nfeasible with today's technology.\n", "  We introduce and investigate a simple model of conditional quantum dynamics.\nIt allows for a discussion of the information-theoretic aspects of quantum\nmeasurements, decoherence, and environment-induced superselection\n(einselection).\n", "  The tunneling of Gaussian wave packets has been investigated by numerically\nsolving the one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation. The shape of wave packets\ninteracting with a square barrier has been monitored for various values of the\nbarrier width, height and initial width of the wave packet. Compared to the\ncase of free propagation, the maximum of a tunneled wave packet exhibits a\nshift, which can be interpreted as an enhanced velocity during tunneling.\n", "  A new quantum algebraic description of relativistic electrons, built on a\nconformal dynamical symmetry (SO(4,2)), has recently been proposed to treat\nlocalization in space-time. It is shown here that localization of an electron\nmay be represented by components of a SO(4,2) vector which are quantum\ngeneralizations of the hexaspherical coordinates of classical projective\ngeometry. The shift of this vector under transformations to uniformly\naccelerated frames is described by SO(4,2) rotations. Hexaspherical observables\nalso allow one to represent the quantum law of free fall under a form\nexplicitly compatible with the same dynamical symmetry.\n"]}
