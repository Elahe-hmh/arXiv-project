This paper\npresent energy levels and wave functions in some of the cases with an exactly\nform and in other cases with an approximated form, this form depended on the\npossibility of integrating the special functions and calculating the zeros of\nthese functions.

The goal is to employ a 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model including\nspectral synthesis to model the corona in an observed solar active region. This\nwill allow us to judge the merits of the coronal heating mechanism built into\nthe 3D model. Methods. Photospheric observations of the magnetic field and\nhorizontal velocities in an active region are used to drive our coronal\nsimulation from the bottom. The currents induced by this heat the corona\nthrough Ohmic dissipation. Heat conduction redistributes the energy that is\nlost in the end through optically thin radiation. Based on the MHD model, we\nsynthesized profiles of coronal emission lines which can be directly compared\nto actual coronal observations of the very same active region. Results. In the\nsynthesized model data we find hot coronal loops which host siphon flows or\nwhich expand and lose mass through draining. These synthesized loops are at the\nsame location as and show similar dynamics in terms of Doppler shifts to the\nobserved structures. This match is shown through a comparison with Hinode data\nas well as with 3D stereoscopic reconstructions of data from STEREO.\nConclusions. The considerable match to the actual observations shows that the\nfield-line braiding mechanism leading to the energy input in our corona\nprovides the proper distribution of heat input in space and time. From this we\nconclude that in an active region the field-line braiding is the dominant\nheating process, at least at the spatial scales available to current\nobservations.\n", "  There exist several ways of constructing general relativity from `first\nprinciples': Einstein's original derivation, Lovelock's results concerning the\nexceptional nature of the Einstein tensor from a mathematical perspective, and\nHojman-Kucha\\v{r}-Teitelboim's derivation of the Hamiltonian form of the theory\nfrom the symmetries of spacetime, to name a few. Here I propose a different set\nof first principles to obtain general relativity in the canonical framework\nwithout presupposing spacetime in any way. I first require consistent\npropagation of scalar spatially covariant constraints. I find that up to a\ncertain order in derivatives (four spatial and two temporal), there are large\nfamilies of such consistently propagated constraints. Then I look for pairs of\nsuch constraints that can gauge-fix each other and form a theory with two\ndynamical degrees of freedom per \\emph{space} point. This demand singles out\nthe ADM Hamiltonian either in i) CMC gauge, with arbitrary (finite, non-zero)\nspeed of light, and an extra term linear in York time, or ii) a gauge where the\nHubble parameter is conformally harmonic.\n", "  We consider a dilute version of the Wigner ensemble of nxn random matrices\n$H$ and study the asymptotic behavior of their moments $M_{2s}$ in the limit of\ninfinite $n$, $s$ and $\\rho$, where $\\rho$ is the dilution parameter. We show\nthat in the asymptotic regime of the strong dilution, the moments $M_{2s}$ with\n$s=\\chi\\rho$ depend on the second and the fourth moments of the random entries\n$H_{ij}$ and do not depend on other even moments of $H_{ij}$. This fact can be\nregarded as an evidence of a new type of the universal behavior of the local\neigenvalue distribution of strongly dilute random matrices at the border of the\nlimiting spectrum. As a by-product of the proof, we describe a new kind of\nCatalan-type numbers related with the tree-type walks.\n", "  Railguns can convert large quantities of electrical energy into kinetic\nenergy of the projectile. This was demon- strated by the 33 MJ muzzle energy\nshot performed in 2010 in the framework of the Office of Naval Research (ONR)\nelectromag- netic railgun program. Since then, railguns are a prime candidate\nfor future long range artillery systems. In this scenario, a heavy projectile\n(several kilograms) is accelerated to approx. 2.5 km/s muzzle velocity. While\nthe primary interest for such a hypersonic projectile is the bombardment of\ntargets being hundreds of kilometers away, they can also be used to counter\nairplane attacks or in other direct fire scenarios. In these cases, the large\ninitial velocity significantly reduces the time to impact the target. In this\nstudy we investigate a scenario, where a future shipboard railgun installation\ndelivers the same kinetic energy to a target as the explosive round of a\ncontemporary European ship artillery system. At the same time the railgun\noutperforms the current artillery systems in range. For this scenario a first\ndraft for the parameters of a railgun system were derived. For the flight-path\nof the projectile, trajectories for different launch angles were simulated and\nthe aero-thermodynamic heating was estimated using engineering-tools developed\nwithin the German Aerospace Center (DLR). This enables the assessment of the\nfeasibility of the different strike scenarios, as well as the identification of\nthe limits of the technology. It is envisioned that this baseline design can be\nused as a helpful starting point for discussions of a possible electrical\nweaponization of future European warships.\n", "  We investigate the behaviour of single-channel theoretical models of cold and\nultracold collisions that take account of inelastic and reactive processes\nusing a single parameter to represent short-range loss. We present plots of the\nresulting energy-dependence of elastic and inelastic or reactive cross sections\nover the full parameter space of loss parameters and short-range phase shifts.\nWe then test the single-channel model by comparing it with the results of\ncoupled-channel calculations of rotationally inelastic collisions between LiH\nmolecules and Li atoms. We find that the range of cross sections predicted by\nthe single-channel model becomes increasingly accurate as the initial LiH\nrotational quantum number increases, with a corresponding increase in the\nnumber of open loss channels. The results suggest that coupled-channel\ncalculations at very low energy (in the s-wave regime) could in some cases be\nused to estimate a loss parameter and then to predict the range of possible\nloss rates at higher energy, without the need for explicit coupled-channel\ncalculations for higher partial waves.\n", "  The dissipative dynamics of a quantum bistable system coupled to a Ohmic heat\nbath is investigated beyond the spin-boson approximation. Within the\npath-integral approach to quantum dissipation, we propose an approximation\nscheme which exploits the separation of time scales between intra- and\ninterwell (tunneling) dynamics. The resulting generalized master equation for\nthe populations in a space localized basis enables us to investigate a wide\nrange of temperatures and system-environment coupling strengths. A phase\ndiagram in the coupling-temperature space is provided to give a comprehensive\naccount of the different dynamical regimes.\n", "  Context. We have conducted a 3D MHD simulation of the solar corona above an\nactive region (AR) in full scale and high resolution, which shows coronal\nloops, and plasma flows within them, similar to observations. Aims. We want to\nfind the connection between the photospheric energy input by field-line\nbraiding with the coronal energy conversion by Ohmic dissipation of induced\ncurrents. Methods. To this end we compare the coronal energy input and\ndissipation within our simulation domain above different fields of view, e.g.\nfor a small loops system in the AR core. We also choose an ensemble of field\nlines to compare, e.g., the magnetic energy input to the heating per particle\nalong these field lines. Results. We find an enhanced Ohmic dissipation of\ncurrents in the corona above areas that also have enhanced upwards-directed\nPoynting flux. These regions coincide with the regions where hot coronal loops\nwithin the AR core are observed. The coronal density plays a role in estimating\nthe coronal temperature due to the generated heat input. A minimum flux density\nof about 200 Gauss is needed in the photosphere to heat a field line to coronal\ntemperatures of about 1 MK. Conclusions. This suggests that the field-line\nbraiding mechanism provides the coronal energy input and that the Ohmic\ndissipation of induced currents dominates the coronal heating mechanism.\n", "  Particular complexity of linear quantum optical networks is deserved recently\ncertain attention due to possible implications for theory of quantum\ncomputation. Two relevant models of bosons are discussed in presented work.\nSymmetric product of Hilbert spaces produces rather abstract model. The second\none is obtained by quantization of harmonic oscillator. In contrast to\nconsidered bosonic processes, so-called \"fermionic linear optics\" is\neffectively simulated on classical computer. The comparison of bosonic and\nfermionic case clarifies the controversy and the more elaborated oscillator\nmodel provides a deeper analogy.\n", "  We consider the ensemble of real symmetric random matrices $H^{(n,\\rho)}$\nobtained from the determinant form of the Ihara zeta function of random graphs\nthat have $n$ vertices with the edge probability $\\rho/n$. We prove that the\nnormalized eigenvalue counting function of $H^{(n,\\rho)}$ weakly converges in\naverage as $n,\\rho\\to\\infty$ and $\\rho=o(n^\\alpha)$ for any $\\alpha>0$ to a\nshift of the Wigner semi-circle distribution. Our results support a conjecture\nthat the large Erdos-R\\'enyi random graphs satisfy in average the weak graph\ntheory Riemann Hypothesis.\n", "  We have spent 50 years in heated discussion over which populations of solar\nenergetic particles (SEPs) are accelerated at flares and which by shock waves\ndriven out from the Sun by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The association of\nthe large \"gradual\" SEP events with shock acceleration is supported by the\nextensive spatial distribution of SEPs and by the delayed acceleration of the\nparticles. The relative abundances of the elements in these gradual events are\na measure of those in the ambient solar corona, differing from those in the\nphotosphere by a widely-observed function of the first ionization potential\n(FIP) of the elements. SEP events we call \"impulsive\", the traditional\n\"3He-rich\" events with enhanced heavy-element abundances, are associated with\ntype III radio bursts, flares, and narrow CMEs; they selectively populate flux\ntubes that thread a localized source, and they are fit to new particle-in-cell\nmodels of magnetic reconnection on open field lines as found in solar jets.\nThese models help explain the strong enhancements seen in heavy elements as a\npower (of 2 - 8) in the mass-to-charge ratio A/Q throughout the periodic table\nfrom He to Pb. A study of the temperature dependence of A/Q shows that the\nsource plasma in impulsive SEP events must lie in the range of 2-4 MK to\nexplain the pattern of abundances. This is much lower than the temperatures of\n>10 MK seen on closed loops in solar flares. Recent studies of A/Q-dependent\nenhancements or suppressions from scattering during transport show source\nplasma temperatures in gradual SEP events to be 0.8-1.6 MK in 69% of the\nevents, i.e. coronal plasma; 24% of the events show reaccelerated\nimpulsive-event material.\n", "  Producing advanced quantum states of light is a priority in quantum\ninformation technologies. While remarkable progress has been made on single\nphotons and photon pairs, multipartite correlated photon states are usually\nproduced in purely optical systems by post-selection or cascading, with\nextremely low efficiency and exponentially poor scaling. Multipartite states\nenable improved tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics as well as\nimplementations of complex quantum optical networks and protocols. It would be\nfavorable to directly generate these states using solid state systems, for\nbetter scaling, simpler handling, and the promise of reversible transfer of\nquantum information between stationary and flying qubits. Here we use the\nground states of two optically active coupled quantum dots to directly produce\nphoton triplets. The wavefunctions of photogenerated excitons localized in\nthese ground states are correlated via molecular hybridization and Coulomb\ninteractions. The formation of a triexciton leads to a triple cascade\nrecombination and sequential emission of three photons with strong\ncorrelations. The quantum dot molecule is embedded in an epitaxially grown\nnanowire engineered for single-mode waveguiding and improved extraction\nefficiency at the emission wavelength. We record 65.62 photon triplets per\nminute, surpassing rates of all earlier reported sources, in spite of the\nmoderate efficiency of our detectors. Our structure and data represent a\nbreakthrough towards implementing multipartite photon entanglement and\nmulti-qubit readout schemes in solid state devices, suitable for integrated\nquantum information processing.\n", "  The Kepler Space Telescope is currently searching for planets transiting\nstars along the ecliptic plane as part of its extended K2 mission. We processed\nthe publicly released data from the first year of K2 observations (Campaigns 0,\n1, 2, and 3) and searched for periodic eclipse signals consistent with\nplanetary transits. Out of 59,174 targets we searched, we detect 234 planetary\ncandidates around 208 stars. These candidates range in size from gas giants to\nsmaller than the Earth, and range in orbital periods from hours to over a\nmonth. We conducted initial reconnaissance spectroscopy of 68 of the brighter\ncandidate host stars, and present high resolution optical spectra for these\nstars. We make all of our data products, including light curves, spectra, and\nvetting diagnostics available to users online.\n", "  Naming game simulates the process of naming an object by a single word, in\nwhich a population of communicating agents can reach global consensus\nasymptotically through iteratively pair-wise conversations. We propose an\nextension of the single-word model to a multi-word naming game (MWNG),\nsimulating the case of describing a complex object by a sentence (multiple\nwords). Words are defined in categories, and then organized as sentences by\ncombining them from different categories. We refer to a formatted combination\nof several words as a pattern. In such an MWNG, through a pair-wise\nconversation, it requires the hearer to achieve consensus with the speaker with\nrespect to both every single word in the sentence as well as the sentence\npattern, so as to guarantee the correct meaning of the saying, otherwise, they\nfail reaching consensus in the interaction. We validate the model in three\ntypical topologies as the underlying communication network, and employ both\nconventional and man-designed patterns in performing the MWNG.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the representational realist stance as a pluralist\nontic approach to inter-theoretic relationships. Our stance stresses the fact\nthat physical theories require the necessary consideration of a conceptual\nlevel of discourse which determines and configures the specific field of\nphenomena discussed by each particular theory. We will criticize the orthodox\nline of research which has grounded the analysis about QM in two (Bohrian)\nmetaphysical presuppositions -accepted in the present as dogmas that all\ninterpretations must follow. We will also examine how the orthodox project of\n\"bridging the gap\" between the quantum and the classical domains has\nconstrained the possibilities of research, producing only a limited set of\ninterpretational problems which only focus in the justification of \"classical\nreality\" and exclude the possibility of analyzing the possibilities of\nnon-classical conceptual representations of QM. The representational realist\nstance introduces two new problems, namely, the superposition problem and the\ncontextuality problem, which consider explicitly the conceptual representation\nof orthodox QM beyond the mere reference to mathematical structures and\nmeasurement outcomes. In the final part of the paper, we revisit, from a\nrepresentational realist perspective, the quantum to classical limit and the\northodox claim that this inter-theoretic relation can be explained through the\nprinciple of decoherence.\n", "  A vacuum type D initial data set is a vacuum initial data set of the Einstein\nfield equations whose data development contains a region where the space-time\nis of Petrov type D. In this paper we give a {\\em systematic} characterisation\nof a vacuum type D initial data set. By systematic we mean that the only\nquantities involved are those appearing in the vacuum constraints, namely the\nfirst fundamental form (Riemannian metric) and the second fundamental form. Our\ncharacterisation is a set of conditions consisting of the vacuum constraints\nand some additional differential equations for the first and second fundamental\nforms. These conditions can be regarded as a system of partial differential\nequations on a Riemannian manifold and the solutions of the system contain all\npossible {\\em regular} vacuum type D initial data sets. As an application we\nparticularise our conditions for the case of vacuum data whose data development\nis a subset of the Kerr solution. This has applications in the formulation of\nthe non-linear stability problem of the Kerr black hole.\n", "  Context. The structure and heating of coronal loops are investigated since\ndecades. Established scaling laws relate fundamental quantities like the loop\napex temperature, pressure, length, and the coronal heating. Aims. We test such\nscaling laws against a large-scale 3D MHD model of the Solar corona, which\nbecame feasible with nowadays high-performance computing. Methods. We drive an\nactive region simulation a with photospheric observations and found strong\nsimilarities to the observed coronal loops in X-rays and EUV wavelength. A 3D\nreconstruction of stereoscopic observations showed that our model loops have a\nrealistic spatial structure. We compare scaling laws to our model data\nextracted along an ensemble of field lines. Finally, we fit a new scaling law\nthat represents well hot loops and also cooler structures, which was not\npossible before only based on observations. Results. Our model data gives some\nsupport for scaling laws that were established for hot and EUV-emissive coronal\nloops. For the RTV scaling law we find an offset to our model data, which can\nbe explained by 1D considerations of a static loop with a constant heat input\nand conduction. With a fit to our model data we set up a new scaling law for\nthe coronal heat input along magnetic field lines. Conclusions. RTV-like\nscaling laws were fitted to hot loops and therefore do not predict well the\ncoronal heat input for cooler structures that are hardly observable. The basic\ndifferences between 1D and self-consistent 3D modeling account for deviations\nbetween our and earlier scaling laws. We also conclude that a heating mechanism\nby MHD-turbulent dissipation within a braided flux tube would heat the corona\nstronger than consistent with our model corona.\n", "  In this paper we intend to discuss the importance of providing a physical\nrepresentation of quantum superpositions which goes beyond the mere reference\nto mathematical structures and measurement outcomes. This proposal goes in the\nopposite direction to the project present in orthodox contemporary philosophy\nof physics which attempts to \"bridge the gap\" between the quantum formalism and\ncommon sense \"classical reality\" --precluding, right from the start, the\npossibility of interpreting quantum superpositions through non-classical\nnotions. We will argue that in order to restate the problem of interpretation\nof quantum mechanics in truly ontological terms we require a radical revision\nof the problems and definitions addressed within the orthodox literature. On\nthe one hand, we will discuss the need of providing a formal redefinition of\nsuperpositions which captures explicitly their contextual character. On the\nother hand, we will attempt to replace the focus on the measurement problem,\nwhich concentrates on the justification of measurement outcomes from \"weird\"\nsuperposed states, and introduce the superposition problem which focuses\ninstead on the conceptual representation of superpositions themselves. In this\nrespect, after presenting three necessary conditions for objective physical\nrepresentation, we will provide arguments which show why the classical\n(actualist) representation of physics faces severe difficulties to solve the\nsuperposition problem. Finally, we will also argue that, if we are willing to\nabandon the (metaphysical) presupposition according to which 'Actuality =\nReality', then there is plenty of room to construct a conceptual representation\nfor quantum superpositions.\n", "  We study generalisations of ghost-free bimetric theory which involve more\nthan two spin-2 fields. The consistent interactions can enter in the form of\ntwo different couplings and in the majority of this work we concentrate on the\nsimpler one. The corresponding action involves one metric coupled to $N$ tensor\nfields which do not interact with each other. We derive maximally symmetric\nsolutions to the multimetric equations of motion and identify the mass\neigenstates in the linearised theory around these backgrounds. Our results are\nthen applied to the problem of singling out multimetric models which possess\ncertain additional structures. In particular, we look for a relation between\nscale invariant background solutions, the perturbative emergence of Weyl\ninvariance and the presence of partially massless spin-2 fields in the linear\ntheory. Our findings generalise known results in bimetric theory and allow us\nto point out similarities and differences between the bi- and multimetric\nmodels.\n", "  Fe-K$_{\\beta}$ X-ray emission spectroscopy measurements reveal an asymmetric\ndoping dependence of the magnetic moments $\\mu_\\text{bare}$ in electron- and\nhole-doped BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$. At low temperature, $\\mu_\\text{bare}$ is nearly\nconstant in hole-doped samples, whereas it decreases upon electron doping.\nIncreasing temperature substantially enhances $\\mu_\\text{bare}$ in the\nhole-doped region, which is naturally explained by the theoretically predicted\ncrossover into a spin-frozen state. Our measurements demonstrate the importance\nof Hund's coupling and electronic correlations, especially for hole-doped\nBaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, and the inadequacy of a fully localized or fully itinerant\ndescription of the 122 family of Fe pnictides.\n", "  In this note we show how the Quantum Information Metric can be computed\nholographically using a perturbative approach. In particular when the\ndeformation of the conformal field theory state is induced by a scalar operator\nthe corresponding bulk configuration reduces to a scalar field perturbatively\nprobing the unperturbed background. We study two concrete examples: a CFT\nground state deformed by a primary operator and thermofield double state in\n$d=2$ deformed by a marginal operator. Finally, we generalize the bulk\nconstruction to the case of a multi dimensional parameter space and show that\nthe Quantum Information Metric coincides with the metric of the non-linear\nsigma model for the corresponding scalar fields.\n", "  The study of singular perturbations of the Dirichlet energy is at the core of\nthe phenomenological-description paradigm in soft condensed matter. Being able\nto pass to the limit plays a crucial role in the understanding of the\ngeometric-driven profile of ground states. In this work we study, under very\ngeneral assumptions, the convergence of minimizers towards harmonic maps. We\nshow that the convergence is locally uniform up to the boundary, away from the\nlower dimensional singular set. Our results generalize related findings, most\nnotably in the theory of liquid-crystals, to all dimensions $n\\geq 3$, and to\ngeneral nonlinearities. Our proof follows a well-known scheme, relying on small\nenergy estimate and monotonicity formula. It departs substantially from\nprevious studies in the treatment of the small energy estimate at the boundary,\nsince we do not rely on the specific form of the potential. In particular this\nextends existing results in 3-dimensional settings. In higher dimensions we\nalso deal with additional difficulties concerning the boundary monotonicity\nformula.\n", "  We introduce and study several combinatorial properties of a class of\nsymmetric polynomials from the point of view of integrable vertex models in\nfinite lattice. We introduce the $L$-operator related with the $U_q(sl_2)$\n$R$-matrix, and construct the wavefunctions and their duals. We prove the exact\ncorrespondence between the wavefunctions and symmetric polynomials which is a\nquantum group deformation of the Grothendieck polynomials. This is proved by\ncombining the matrix product method and an analysis on the domain wall boundary\npartition functions. As applications of the correspondence between the\nwavefunctions and symmetric polynomials, we derive several properties of the\nsymmetric polynomials such as the determinant pairing formulas and the\nbranching formulas by analyzing the domain wall boundary partition functions\nand the matrix elements of the $B$-operators.\n", "  Temperature-dependent (5 K to 300 K) Raman scattering study of\nA$_{1g}$/A'$_1$ phonon modes in mono-layer (1L), bilayer (2L), trilayer (3L),\nand tetralayer (4L) MoTe$_2$ is reported. The temperature evolution of the\nmodes' intensity critically depends on the flake thickness. In particular with\n$\\lambda$=632.8 nm light excitation, a strongly non-monotonic dependence of the\nA$_{1g}$ mode intensity is observed in 2L MoTe$_2$. The intensity decreases\nwith decreasing temperature down to 220 K and the A$_{1g}$ mode almost\ncompletely vanishes from the Stokes scattering spectrum in the temperature\nrange between 160 K and 220 K. The peak recovers at lower temperatures and at\nT=5 K it becomes three times more intense that at room temperature. Similar\nnon-monotonic intensity evolution is observed for the out-of-plane mode in 3L\nMoTe$_2$ in which tellurium atoms in all three layers vibrate in-phase. The\nintensity of the other out-of-plane Raman-active mode, (with vibrations of\ntellurium atoms in the central layer shifted by 180$^o$ with respect to the\nvibrations in outer layers), only weakly depends on temperature. The observed\nquenching of the Raman scattering in 2L and 3L MoTe$_2$ is attributed to a\ndestructive interference between the resonant and non-resonant contributions to\nthe Raman scattering amplitude. The observed \"antiresonance\" is related to the\nelectronic excitation at the M point of the Brillouin zone in few-layer\nMoTe$_2$.\n", "  A first quantized free photon is a complex massless vector field $A=(A^\\mu)$\nwhose field strength satisfies Maxwell's equations in vacuum. We construct the\nHilbert space $\\mathscr{H}$ of the photon by endowing the vector space of the\nfields $A$ in the temporal-Coulomb gauge with a positive-definite and\nrelativistically invariant inner product. We give an explicit expression for\nthis inner product, identify the Hamiltonian for the photon with the generator\nof time translations in $\\mathscr{H}$, determine the operators representing the\nmomentum and the helicity of the photon, and introduce a chirality operator\nwhose eigenfunctions correspond to fields having a definite sign of energy. We\nalso construct a position operator for the photon whose components commute with\neach other and with the chirality and helicity operators. This allows for the\nconstruction of the localized states of the photon with a definite sign of\nenergy and helicity. We derive an explicit formula for the latter and compute\nthe corresponding electric and magnetic fields. These turn out to diverge not\njust at the point where the photon is localized but on a plane containing this\npoint. We identify the axis normal to this plane with an associated symmetry\naxis, and show that each choice of this axis specifies a particular position\noperator, a corresponding position basis, and a position representation of the\nquantum mechanics of photon. In particular, we examine the position wave\nfunctions determined by such a position basis, elucidate their relationship\nwith the Riemann-Silberstein and Landau-Peierls wave functions, and give an\nexplicit formula for the probability density of the spatial localization of the\nphoton.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a class of Hamiltonian systems with dissipation,\ncoupled to noise, in a singular (small mass) limit. We derive the homogenized\nequation for the position degrees of freedom in the limit, including the\npresence of a {\\em noise-induced drift} term. We prove convergence to the\nsolution of the homogenized equation in probability and, under stronger\nassumptions, in an $L^p$-norm. Applications cover the overdamped limit of\nparticle motion in a time-dependent electromagnetic field, on a manifold with\ntime-dependent metric, and the dynamics of nuclear matter.\n", "  Random networks are increasingly used to analyse complex transportation\nnetworks, such as airline routes, roads and rail networks. So far, this\nresearch has been focused on describing the properties of the networks with the\nhelp of random networks, often without considering their spatial properties. In\nthis article, a methodology is proposed to create random networks conserving\ntheir spatial properties. The produced random networks are not intended to be\nan accurate model of the real-world network being investigated, but are to be\nused to gain insight into the functioning of the network taking into\nconsideration its spatial properties, which has potential to be useful in many\ntypes of analysis, e.g. estimating the network related risk. The proposed\nmethodology combines a spatial non-homogeneous point process for vertex\ncreation, which accounts for the spatial distribution of vertices, considering\nclustering effects of the network and a hybrid connection model for the edge\ncreation. To illustrate the ability of the proposed methodology to be used to\ngain insight into a real world network, it is used to estimate standard\nstructural statistics for part of the Swiss road network, and these are then\ncompared with the known values.\n", "  We investigate the spectral properties of a quasi-one-dimensional lattice in\ntwo possible dimerisation configurations. Both configurations are characterized\nby the same lattice topology and the identical spectra containing a flat band\nat zero energy. We find that one of the dimerised configuration has similar\nsymmetry to a one-dimensional chain proposed by Su-Schrieffer-Heeger for\nstudying solitons in conjugated polymers. Whereas, the other dimerised\nconfiguration only shows non-trivial topological properties in the presence of\nchiral-symmetry breaking adiabatic pumping.\n", "  We present physical properties [redshifts (z), star-formation rates (SFRs)\nand stellar masses (Mstar)] of bright (S850>4mJy) submm galaxies in the ~2deg2\nCOSMOS and UDS fields selected with SCUBA-2/JCMT. We complete the galaxy\nidentification process for all (~2000) S/N>3.5 850-um sources, but focus our\nscientific analysis on a high-quality sub-sample of 651 S/N>4 sources with\ncomplete multi-wavelength coverage including 1.1-mm imaging. We check the\nreliability of our identifications, and the robustness of the SCUBA-2 fluxes by\nrevisiting the recent ALMA follow-up of 29 sources in our sample. Considering\n>4mJy ALMA sources, our identification method has a completeness of ~86 per\ncent with a reliability of ~92 per cent, and only ~15-20 per cent of sources\nare significantly affected by multiplicity (when a secondary component\ncontributes >1/3 of the primary source flux). The impact of source blending on\nthe 850-um source counts as determined with SCUBA-2 is modest; scaling the\nsingle-dish fluxes by ~0.9 reproduces the ALMA source counts. For our final\nSCUBA-2 sample we find median z=2.40+0.10-0.04, SFR=287+-6Moyr-1, and\nlog(Mstar/Mo)=11.12+-0.02 (the latter for 349/651 sources with optical\nidentifications). These properties clearly locate bright submm galaxies on the\nhigh-mass end of the 'main sequence' of star-forming galaxies out to z~6,\nsuggesting that major mergers are not a dominant driver of the high-redshift\nsubmm-selected population. Their number densities are also consistent with the\nevolving galaxy stellar mass function. Hence, the submm galaxy population is as\nexpected, albeit reproducing the evolution of the main sequence of star-forming\ngalaxies remains a challenge for theoretical models/simulations.\n", "  Many networks are used to transfer information or goods, in other words, they\nare navigated. The larger the network, the more difficult it is to navigate\nefficiently. Indeed, information routing in the Internet faces serious\nscalability problems due to its rapid growth, recently accelerated by the rise\nof the Internet of Things. Large networks like the Internet can be navigated\nefficiently if nodes, or agents, actively forward information based on hidden\nmaps underlying these systems. However, in reality most agents will deny to\nforward messages, which has a cost, and navigation is impossible. Can we design\nappropriate incentives that lead to participation and global navigability?\nHere, we present an evolutionary game where agents share the value generated by\nsuccessful delivery of information or goods. We show that global navigability\ncan emerge, but its complete breakdown is possible as well. Furthermore, we\nshow that the system tends to self-organize into local clusters of agents who\nparticipate in the navigation. This organizational principle can be exploited\nto favor the emergence of global navigability in the system.\n", "  A discretization scheme is introduced for a set of convection-diffusion\nequations with a non-linear reaction term, where the convection velocity is\nconstant for each reactant. This constancy allows a transformation to new\nspatial variables, which ensures the global stability of discretization.\nConvection-diffusion equations are notorious for their lack of stability,\narising from the algebraic interaction of the convection and diffusion terms.\nUnexpectedly, our implemented numerical algorithm proves to be faster than\ncomputing exact solutions derived for a special case, while remaining\nreasonably accurate, as demonstrated in our runtime and error analysis.\n", "  Establishing a quantitative connection between the population growth rate and\nthe generation times of single cells is a prerequisite for understanding\nevolutionary dynamics of microbes. However, existing theories fail to account\nfor the experimentally observed correlations between mother-daughter generation\ntimes that are unavoidable when cell size is controlled for - which is\nessentially always the case. Here, we study population-level growth in the\npresence of cell size control and corroborate our theory using experimental\nmeasurements of single-cell growth rates. We derive a closed formula for the\npopulation growth rate and demonstrate that it only depends on the single-cell\ngrowth rate variability, not other sources of stochasticity. Our work provides\nan evolutionary rationale for the narrow growth rate distributions often\nobserved in nature: when single-cell growth rates are less variable but have a\nfixed mean, the population will exhibit an enhanced population growth rate, as\nlong as the correlations between the mother and daughter cells' growth rates\nare not too strong.\n", "  This paper introduces an active learning approach to the fitting of machine\nlearning interatomic potentials. Our approach is based on the D-optimality\ncriterion for selecting atomic configurations on which the potential is fitted.\nIt is shown that the proposed active learning approach is highly efficient in\ntraining potentials on the fly, ensuring that no extrapolation is attempted and\nleading to a completely reliable atomistic simulation without any significant\ndecrease in accuracy. We apply our approach to molecular dynamics and structure\nrelaxation, and we argue that it can be applied, in principle, to any other\ntype of atomistic simulation. The software, test cases, and examples of usage\nare published at http://gitlab.skoltech.ru/shapeev/mlip/.\n", "  An analytical solution for the light trajectory in the near-zone of the\ngravitational field of one pointlike body in arbitrary slow-motion in the\npost-post-Newtonian approximation is presented in harmonic gauge. Expressions\nfor total light deflection and time delay are given. The presented solution is\na further step toward high-precision astrometry aiming at nano-arcsecond level\nof accuracy.\n", "  We study the bosonic two-body problem in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger dimerized\nchain with on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions. We find two classes of\nbound states. The first, similar to the one induced by on-site interactions,\nhas its center of mass on the strong link, whereas the second, existing only\nthanks to nearest-neighbors interactions, is centered on the weak link. We\nidentify energy crossings between these states and analyse them using exact\ndiagonalization and perturbation theory. In the presence of open boundary\nconditions, novel strongly-localized edge-bound states appear in the spectrum\nas a consequence of the interplay between lattice geometry, on-site and\nnearest-neighbor interactions. Contrary to the case of purely on-site\ninteractions, such EBS persist even in the strongly interacting regime.\n", "  In a gas of $N$ interacting bosons, the Hamiltonian $H_c$, obtained by\ndropping all the interaction terms between free bosons with moment\n$\\hbar\\mathbf{k}\\ne\\mathbf{0}$, is diagonalized exactly. The resulting\neigenstates $|\\:S,\\:\\mathbf{k},\\:\\eta\\:\\rangle$ depend on two discrete indices\n$S,\\:\\eta=0,\\:1,\\:\\dots$, where $\\eta$ numerates the \\emph{quasiphonons}\ncarrying a moment $\\hbar\\mathbf{k}$, responsible for transport or dissipation\nprocesses. $S$, in turn, numerates a ladder of \\textquoteleft\nvacua\\textquoteright$\\:|\\:S,\\:\\mathbf{k},\\:0\\:\\rangle$, with increasing\nequispaced energies, formed by boson pairs with opposite moment. Passing from\none vacuum to another ($S\\rightarrow S\\pm1$), results from\ncreation/annihilation of new momentless collective excitations, that we call\n\\emph{vacuons}. Exact quasiphonons originate from one of the vacua by\n\\textquoteleft creating\\textquoteright$\\:$an asymmetry in the number of\nopposite moment bosons. The well known Bogoliubov collective excitations (CEs)\nare shown to coincide with the exact eigenstates\n$|\\:0,\\:\\mathbf{k},\\:\\eta\\:\\rangle$, i.e. with the quasiphonons created from\nthe lowest-level vacuum ($S=0$). All this is discussed, in view of existing or\nfuture experimental observations of the vacuons (PBs), a sort of bosonic Cooper\npairs, which are the main factor of novelty beyond Bogoliubov theory.\n", "  We study the possible cosmological models in Kaluza-Klein-type\nmultidimensional gravity with a curvature-nonlinear Lagrangian and a spherical\nextra space, taking into account the Casimir energy. First, we find a minimum\nof the effective potential of extra dimensions, leading to a physically\nreasonable value of the effective cosmological constant in our 4D space-time.\nIn this model, the huge Casimir energy density is compensated by a fine-tuned\ncontribution of the curvature-nonlinear terms in the original action. Second,\nwe present a viable model with slowly evolving extra dimensions and power-law\ninflation in our space-time. In both models, the results formulated in Einstein\nand Jordan frames are compared.\n", "  In 6D general relativity with a phantom scalar field as a source of gravity,\nwe present solutions that implement a transition from an effective 4D geometry\ntimes small extra dimensions to an effectively 6D space-time where the physical\nlaws are different from ours. We consider manifolds with the structure M0 x M1\nx M2, where M0 is 2D Lorentzian space-time while each of M1 and M2 can be a\n2-sphere or a 2-torus. Some solutions describe wormholes with spherical\nsymmetry in our space-time and toroidal extra dimensions. Others are of black\nuniverse type: at one end there is a 6D asymptotically anti-de Sitter black\nhole while beyond the horizon the geometry tends to a 4D de Sitter cosmology\ntimes a small 2D spherical extra space.\n", "  Recent results on the optical properties of mono- and few-layers of\nsemiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides are reviewed. Experimental\nobservations are presented and discussed in the frame of existing models,\nhighlighting the limits of our understanding in this emerging field of\nresearch. We first introduce the representative band structure of these systems\nand their interband optical transitions. The effect of an external magnetic\nfield is then considered to discuss Zeeman spectroscopy and optical pumping\nexperiments, both revealing phenomena related to the valley degree of freedom.\nFinally, we discuss the observation of single photon emitters in different\ntypes of layered materials, including wide band gap hexagonal boron nitride.\nWhile going through these topics, we try to focus on open questions and on\nexperimental observations, which do not yet have a clear explanation.\n", "  We investigated the effect of photoionising feedback inside turbulent\nstar-forming clouds, comparing the resultant star formation in both idealised\nprofiles and more realistic cloud structures drawn from a global galaxy\nsimulation. We performed a series of numerical simulations which compared the\neffect of star formation alone, photoionisation and photoionisation plus\nsupernovae feedback. In the idealised cloud, photoionisation suppresses gas\nfragmentation at early times, resulting in the formation of more massive stars\nand an increase in the star formation efficiency. At later times, the dispersal\nof the dense gas causes the radiative feedback effect to switch from positive\nto negative as the star formation efficiency drops. In the cloud extracted from\nthe global simulation, the initial cloud is heavily fragmented prior to the\nstellar feedback beginning and is largely structurally unaffected by the late\ninjection of radiation energy. The result is a suppression of the star\nformation. We conclude that the efficiency of feedback is heavily dependent on\nthe gas structure, with negative feedback dominating when the density is high.\n", "  The utility of the notion of generalized disclinations in materials science\nis discussed within the physical context of modeling interfacial and bulk line\ndefects like defected grain and phase boundaries, dislocations and\ndisclinations. The Burgers vector of a disclination dipole in linear elasticity\nis derived, clearly demonstrating the equivalence of its stress field to that\nof an edge dislocation. We also prove that the inverse deformation/displacement\njump of a defect line is independent of the cut-surface when its g.disclination\nstrength vanishes. An explicit formula for the displacement jump of a single\nlocalized composite defect line in terms of given g.disclination and\ndislocation strengths is deduced based on the Weingarten theorem for\ng.disclination theory (Weingarten-gd theorem) at finite deformation. The\nBurgers vector of a g.disclination dipole at finite deformation is also\nderived.\n", "  We prove that when suitably normalized, small enough powers of the absolute\nvalue of the characteristic polynomial of random Hermitian matrices, drawn from\none-cut regular unitary invariant ensembles, converge in law to Gaussian\nmultiplicative chaos measures. We prove this in the so-called $L^2$-phase of\nmultiplicative chaos. Our main tools are asymptotics of Hankel determinants\nwith Fisher-Hartwig singularities. Using Riemann-Hilbert methods, we prove a\nrather general Fisher-Hartwig formula for one-cut regular unitary invariant\nensembles.\n", "  We study the optically induced torques in thin film ferromagnetic layers\nunder excitation by circularly polarized light. We study cases both with and\nwithout Rashba spin-orbit coupling using a 4-band model. In the absence of\nRashba spin-orbit coupling, we derive an analytic expression for the optical\ntorques, revealing the conditions under which the torque is mostly derived from\noptical spin transfer torque (i.e. when the torque is along the direction of\noptical angular momentum), versus when the torque is derived from the inverse\nFaraday effect (i.e. when the torque is perpendicular to the optical angular\nmomentum). We find the optical spin transfer torque dominates provided that the\nexcitation energy is far away from band edge transitions, and the magnetic\nexchange splitting is much greater than the lifetime broadening. For the case\nwith large Rashba spin-orbit coupling and out-of-plane magnetization, we find\nthe torque is generally perpendicular to the photon angular momentum and is\nascribed to an optical Edelstein effect.\n", "  We study the free energy across a stratified media made by graphene (G)\nand/or molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). The flux depends not only on the number of\nG/MoS2 layers but also on the priority of graphene layer respect to MoS2 layer\nin the media. The rule is; the thinner layer should be the nearest neighborhood\nof leftmost and rightmost sides of the media for getting the highest energy\nflux. The free energy can be tuned by applying an external gate voltage to MoS2\nlayers due to the tunable property of the dielectric constant of MoS2 by the\ngate voltage. Also we show in the silicon/MoS2/silicon three-body\nconfiguration, the photon heat tunneling is amplified significantly due to the\nincreasing the number of the coupled modes. Due to the amplifying effect, this\nmechanism could be exploited to improving detection ability in the near\ninfrared detection systems.\n", "  The k-essence theory with a power-law function of $(\\partial\\phi)^2$ and\nRastall's non-conservative theory of gravity with a scalar field are shown to\nhave the same solutions for the metric under the assumption that both the\nmetric and the scalar fields depend on a single coordinate. This equivalence\n(called k-R duality) holds for static configurations with various symmetries\n(spherical, plane, cylindrical, etc.) and all homogeneous cosmologies. In the\npresence of matter, Rastall's theory requires additional assumptions on how the\nstress-energy tensor non-conservation is distributed between different\ncontributions. Two versions of such non-conservation are considered in the case\nof isotropic spatially flat cosmological models with a perfect fluid: one (R1)\nin which there is no coupling between the scalar field and the fluid, and\nanother (R2) in which the fluid separately obeys the usual conservation law. In\nversion R1 it is shown that k-R duality holds not only for the cosmological\nmodels themselves but also for their adiabatic perturbations. In version R2,\namong other results, a particular model is singled out that reproduces the same\ncosmological expansion history as the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model but predicts\ndifferent behaviors of small fluctuations in the k-essence and Rastall\nframeworks.\n", "  Surface stress, also known as surface tension, is a fundamental material\nproperty of any interface. However, measurements of solid surface stress in\ntraditional engineering materials, such as metals and oxides, have proven to be\nvery challenging. Consequently, our understanding relies heavily on untested\ntheories, especially regarding the strain dependence of this property. Here, we\ntake advantage of the high compliance and large elastic deformability of a soft\npolymer gel to directly measure solid surface stress as a function of strain.\nAs anticipated by theoretical work for metals, we find that the surface stress\ndepends on the strain via a surface modulus. Remarkably, the surface modulus of\nour soft gels is many times larger than the zero-strain surface tension. This\nsuggests that surfaces stresses can play a dominant role in solid mechanics at\nmuch larger length scales than previously anticipated.\n", "  In a recent paper we studied the effect of new-physics operators with\ndifferent Lorentz structures on the semileptonic $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c \\tau\n\\bar{\\nu}_{\\tau}$ decay. This decay is of interest in light of the\n$R({D^{(*)}})$ puzzle in the semileptonic $\\bar{B} \\to D^{(*)} \\tau\n{\\bar\\nu}_\\tau$ decays. In this work we add tensor operators to extend our\nprevious results and consider both model-independent new physics (NP) and\nspecific classes of models proposed to address the $R({D^{(*)}})$ puzzle. We\nshow that a measurement of $R(\\Lambda_c) = {\\cal B}[\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c\n\\tau \\bar{\\nu}_{\\tau}] / {\\cal B}[\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c \\ell\n\\bar{\\nu}_{\\ell}]$ can strongly constrain the NP parameters of models discussed\nfor the $R({D^{(*)}})$ puzzle. We use form factors from lattice QCD to\ncalculate all $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c \\tau \\bar{\\nu}_{\\tau}$ observables. The\n$\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c$ tensor form factors had not previously been\ndetermined in lattice QCD, and we present new lattice results for these form\nfactors here.\n", "  The mathematical notion of spectral singularity admits a description in terms\nof purely outgoing solutions of a corresponding linear wave equation. This\nleads to a nonlinear generalization of this notion for nonlinearities that are\nconfined in space. We examine the nonlinear spectral singularities in arbitrary\nTE and TM modes of a mirrorless slab laser that involves a weak Kerr\nnonlinearity. This provides a computational scheme for the determination of the\nlaser output intensity $I$ for these modes. In particular, we offer an\nessentially mathematical derivation of the linear-dependence of $I$ on the gain\ncoefficient $g$ and obtain an explicit analytic expression for its slope. This\nshows that if the real part $\\eta$ of the refractive index of the slab does not\nexceed 3, there is a lower bound on $\\theta$ below which lasing in both its TE\nand TM modes requires $\\eta$ to be shifted by a small amount as $g$ surpasses\nthe threshold gain. Our results suggest that lasing in the oblique TM modes of\nthe slab is forbidden if the incidence (emission) angle of the TM mode exceeds\nthe Brewster's angle.\n", "  The classical-input quantum-output (cq) wiretap channel is a communication\nmodel involving a classical sender $X$, a legitimate quantum receiver $B$, and\na quantum eavesdropper $E$. The goal of a private communication protocol that\nuses such a channel is for the sender $X$ to transmit a message in such a way\nthat the legitimate receiver $B$ can decode it reliably, while the eavesdropper\n$E$ learns essentially nothing about which message was transmitted. The\n$\\varepsilon $-one-shot private capacity of a cq wiretap channel is equal to\nthe maximum number of bits that can be transmitted over the channel, such that\nthe privacy error is no larger than $\\varepsilon\\in(0,1)$. The present paper\nprovides a lower bound on the $\\varepsilon$-one-shot private classical\ncapacity, by exploiting the recently developed techniques of Anshu,\nDevabathini, Jain, and Warsi, called position-based coding and convex\nsplitting. The lower bound is equal to a difference of the hypothesis testing\nmutual information between $X$ and $B$ and the \"alternate\" smooth\nmax-information between $X$ and $E$. The one-shot lower bound then leads to a\nnon-trivial lower bound on the second-order coding rate for private classical\ncommunication over a memoryless cq wiretap channel.\n", "  Physical implementations of quantum annealing unavoidably operate at finite\ntemperatures. We point to a fundamental limitation of fixed finite temperature\nquantum annealers that prevents them from functioning as competitive scalable\noptimizers and show that to serve as optimizers annealer temperatures must be\nappropriately scaled down with problem size. We derive a temperature scaling\nlaw dictating that temperature must drop at the very least in a logarithmic\nmanner but also possibly as a power law with problem size. We corroborate our\nresults by experiment and simulations and discuss the implications of these to\npractical annealers.\n", "  Wave polarization contains valuable information for electromagnetic signal\nprocessing and the ability to manipulate it can be extremely useful in photonic\ndevices. In this work, we propose designs comprised of one of the emerging and\ninteresting two-dimensional media: Black Phosphorus. Due to substantial\nin-plane anisotropy, a single slab of Black Phosphorus can be very efficient\nfor manipulating the polarization state of electromagnetic waves. We\ninvestigate Black Phosphorus slabs that filter the fields along one direction,\nor polarization axis rotation, or convert linear polarization to circular.\nThese slabs can be employed as components in numerous mid-IR integrated\ndevices.\n", "  Arising out of a Non-local non-relativistic BEC, we present an Analogue\ngravity model upto $\\mathcal{O}(\\xi^{2})$ accuracy in the presence of the\nquantum potential term for a canonical acoustic BH in $(3+1)$-d spacetime where\nthe series solution of the free minimally coupled KG equation for the large\nlength scale massive scalar modes is derived. We systematically address the\nissues of the presence of the quantum potential term being the root cause of a\nUV-IR coupling between short wavelength `primary' modes which are supposedly\nHawking radiated through the sonic horizon and the large wavelength `secondary'\nmodes. In the quantum gravity experiments of analogue Hawking radiation in the\nlaboratory, this UV-IR coupling is inevitable and one can not get rid of these\nlarge wavelength excitations which would grow over space by gaining energy from\nthe short wavelength Hawking radiated modes. We identify the characteristic\nfeature in the growth rate(s) that would distinguish these primary and\nsecondary modes.\n", "  We study experimentally and theoretically the steady-state dynamics of a\nsimple stochastic electronic system featuring two resistor-capacitor circuits\ncoupled by a third capacitor. The resistors are subject to thermal noises at\nreal temperatures. The voltage fluctuation across each resistor can be compared\nto a one-dimensional Brownian motion. However, the collective dynamical\nbehavior, when the resistors are subject to distinct thermal baths, is\nidentical to that of a Brownian gyrator, as first proposed by R. Filliger and\nP. Reimann in Physical Review Letters 99, 230602 (2007). The average gyrating\ndynamics is originated from the absence of detailed balance due to unequal\nthermal baths. We look into the details of this stochastic gyrating dynamics,\nits dependences on the temperature difference and coupling strength, and the\nmechanism of heat transfer through this simple electronic circuit. Our work\naffirms the general principle and the possibility of a Brownian ratchet working\nnear room temperature scale.\n", "  The ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density is calculated for\nnon-extremal Gauss-Bonnet (GB) black holes coupled to Born-Infeld (BI)\nelectrodynamics in $5$ dimensions. The result is found to get corrections from\nthe BI parameter and is analytically exact upto all orders in this parameter.\nThe computations are then extended to $D$ dimensions.\n", "  We study how matter-wave interferometry with Bose-Einstein condensates is\naffected by hypothetical collapse models and by environmental decoherence\nprocesses. Motivated by recent atom fountain experiments with macroscopic arm\nseparations, we focus on the observable signatures of first-order and\nhigher-order coherence for different two-mode superposition states, and on\ntheir scaling with particle number. This can be used not only to assess the\nimpact of environmental decoherence on many-body coherence, but also to\nquantify the extent to which macrorealistic collapse models are ruled out by\nsuch experiments. We find that interference fringes of phase-coherently split\ncondensates are most strongly affected by decoherence, whereas the quantum\nsignatures of independent interfering condensates are more immune against\nmacrorealistic collapse. A many-body enhanced decoherence effect beyond the\nlevel of a single atom can be probed if higher-order correlations are resolved\nin the interferogram.\n", "  The electromagnetic (EM) follow-up of a gravitational wave (GW) event\nrequires to scan a wide sky region, defined by the so called \"skymap\", for the\ndetection and identification of a transient counterpart. We propose a novel\nmethod that exploits information encoded in the GW signal to construct a\n\"detectability map\", which represents the time-dependent (\"when\") probability\nto detect the transient at each position of the skymap (\"where\"). Focusing on\nthe case of a neutron star binary inspiral, we model the associated short\ngamma-ray burst afterglow and macronova emission, using the probability\ndistributions of binary parameters (sky position, distance, orbit inclination,\nmass ratio) extracted from the GW signal as inputs. The resulting family of\npossible lightcurves is the basis to construct the detectability map. As a\npractical example, we apply the method to a simulated GW signal produced by a\nneutron star merger at 75 Mpc whose localization uncertainty is very large\n(about 1500 square degrees). We construct observing strategies based on the\ndetectability maps for optical, infrared and radio facilities, taking VST,\nVISTA and MeerKAT as prototypes. Assuming limiting fluxes of r ~ 24.5, J ~ 22.4\n(AB magnitudes) and 500 uJy @ 1.4 GHz for ~ 1000 s of exposure each, the\nafterglow and macronova emissions are successfully detected with a minimum\nobserving time of 7, 15 and 5 hours respectively.\n", "  Conventionally, space-charge (SC) limited current density is defined as the\nmaximal cur- rent density allowed to traverse a diode under a DC voltage when a\ntime-invariant flow is injected from the cathode. In this work, we study the SC\nlimited current density under a time-varying injection for both classical and\nrelativistic regimes and determine the maxi- mal amount of limited current\ndensity under certain conditions. Our simulations show that it is unlikely that\na time-varying injection emitted from cathode exceeds the known SC limits, in\neither classical or relativistic regime.\n", "  Micro- and nano-electromechanical resonators are a fundamental building block\nof modern technology, used in environmental monitoring, robotics, medical tools\nas well as fundamental science. These devices rely on dedicated electronics to\ngenerate their driving signal, resulting in an increased complexity and size.\nHere, we present a new paradigm to achieve high-frequency mechanical actuation\nbased on the metal-insulator transition of VO$\\mathrm{_2}$, where the steep\nvariation of its electronic properties enables to realize high-frequency\nelectrical oscillations. The dual nature of this phase change, which is both\nelectronic and structural, turns the electrical oscillations into an intrinsic\nactuation mechanism, powered by a small DC voltage and capable to selectively\nexcite the different mechanical modes of a microstructure. Our results pave the\nway towards the realization of micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems with\nautonomous actuation from integrated DC power sources such as solar cells or\nmicro-batteries.\n", "  Infrared (IR) transmittance tunable metal-insulator conversion was\ndemonstrated on glass substrate by using thermochromic vanadium dioxide (VO2)\nas the active layer in three-terminal thin-film-transistor-type device with\nwater-infiltrated glass as the gate insulator. Alternative positive/negative\ngate-voltage applications induce the reversible protonation/deprotonation of\nVO2 channel, and two-orders of magnitude modulation of sheet-resistance and 49%\nmodulation of IR-transmittance were simultaneously demonstrated at room\ntemperature by the metal-insulator phase conversion of VO2 in a non-volatile\nmanner. The present device is operable by the room-temperature protonation in\nall-solid-state structure, and thus it will provide a new gateway to future\nenergy-saving technology as advanced smart window.\n", "  The quantum version of the Boltzmann transport equation (Wigner-Boltzmann\nequation) is a quite useful tool to investigate the effects of energy\ndissipation in quantum systems. Numerical approaches uses to be employed in\norder to stablish a suitable solution. In this paper, an analytical solution is\nshown to exist when the constant relaxation time approximation is considered.\nThe formalism presented here is capable to avoid some unphysical features early\nreported in literature for the conventional boundary condition scheme.\n", "  A liquid film wetting the interior of a long circular cylinder redistributes\nunder the action of surface tension to form annular collars or occlusive plugs.\nThese equilibrium structures are invariant under axial translation within a\nperfectly smooth uniform tube and therefore can be displaced axially by very\nweak external forcing. We consider how this degeneracy is disrupted when the\ntube wall is rough, and determine threshold conditions under which collars or\nplugs resist displacement under forcing. Wall roughness is modelled as a\nnon-axisymmetric Gaussian random field of prescribed correlation length and\nsmall variance, mimicking some of the geometric irregularities inherent in\napplications such as lung airways. The thin film coating this surface is\nmodelled using lubrication theory. When the roughness is weak, we show how the\nlocations of equilibrium collars and plugs can be identified in terms of the\nazimuthally averaged tube radius; we derive conditions specifying equilibrium\ncollar locations under an externally imposed shear flow, and plug locations\nunder an imposed pressure gradient. We use these results to determine the\nprobability of external forcing being sufficient to displace a collar or plug\nfrom a rough-walled tube, when the tube roughness is defined only in\nstatistical terms.\n", "  We explore the $n$-body problem, $n\\geq 3,$ on a surface of revolution with a\ngeneral interaction depending on the pairwise geodesic distance. Using the\ngeometric methods of classical mechanics we determine a large set of\nproperties. In particular, we show that Saari's conjecture fails on surfaces of\nrevolution admitting a geodesic circle. We define homographic motions and,\nusing the discrete symmetries, prove that when the masses are equal, they form\nan invariant manifold. On this manifold the dynamics are reducible to a\none-degree of freedom system. We also find that for attractive interactions,\nregular $n$-gon shaped relative equilibria with trajectories located on\ngeodesic circles typically experience a pitchfork bifurcation. Some\napplications are included.\n", "  It is commonly claimed that only Hamiltonians with a spectrum unbounded both\nabove and below can give purely exponential decay. Because such Hamiltonians\nhave no ground state, they are considered unphysical. Here we show that\nHamiltonians which are bounded below can give purely exponential decay. This is\npossible when, instead of looking at the global survival probability, one\nconsiders a subsystem only. We conclude that purely exponential decay might not\nbe as unphysical as previously thought.\n", "  In the absence of advection, confined diffusion characterizes transport in\nmany natural and artificial devices, such as ionic channels, zeolites, and\nnanopores. While extensive theoretical and numerical studies on this subject\nhave produced many important predictions, experimental verifications of the\npredictions are rare. Here, we experimentally measure colloidal diffusion times\nin microchannels with periodically varying width and contrast results with\npredictions from the Fick-Jacobs theory and Brownian dynamics simulation. While\nthe theory and simulation correctly predict the entropic effect of the varying\nchannel width, they fail to account for hydrodynamic effects, which include\nboth an overall decrease and a spatial variation of diffusivity in channels.\nNeglecting such hydrodynamic effects, the theory and simulation underestimate\nthe mean and standard deviation of first passage times by 40\\% in channels with\na neck width twice the particle diameter. We further show that the validity of\nthe Fick-Jakobs theory can be restored by reformulating it in terms of the\nexperimentally measured diffusivity. Our work thus demonstrates that\nhydrodynamic effects play a key role in diffusive transport through narrow\nchannels and should be included in theoretical and numerical models.\n", "  We report on a measurement of the flavor-specific $B^{0}_{s}$ lifetime and of\nthe $D^{-}_{s}$ lifetime using proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass\nenergies of 7 and 8 TeV, collected by the LHCb experiment and corresponding to\n3.0 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. Approximately 407 000 $B^{0}_{s}\n\\rightarrow D^{(*)-}_{s} \\mu^{+}\\nu_\\mu $ decays are partially reconstructed in\nthe $K^{+}K^{-}\\pi^{-}\\mu^{+}$ final state. The $B^{0}_{s}$ and $D^{-}_{s}$\nnatural widths are determined using, as a reference, kinematically similar\n$B^{0} \\rightarrow D^{(*)-}\\mu^{+}\\nu_\\mu$ decays reconstructed in the same\nfinal state. The resulting differences between widths of $B^{0}_{s}$ and\n$B^{0}$ mesons and of $D^{-}_{s}$ and $D^{-}$ mesons are $\\Delta_\\Gamma(B)\n=-0.0115 \\pm 0.0053 (stat) \\pm 0.0041 (syst)$ ps$^{-1}$ and $\\Delta_\\Gamma(D) =\n1.0131 \\pm 0.0117 (stat) \\pm 0.0065 (syst)$ ps$^{-1}$, respectively. Combined\nwith the known $B^{0}$ and $D^{-}$ lifetimes, these yield the flavor-specific\n$B^{0}_{s}$ lifetime, $\\tau^{\\rm fs}_{B^{0}_{s}} = 1.547 \\pm 0.013 (stat) \\pm\n0.010 (syst) \\pm 0.004 (\\tau_{B})$ ps and the $D^{-}_{s}$ lifetime,\n$\\tau_{D^{-}_{s}} = 0.5064 \\pm 0.0030 (stat) \\pm 0.0017 (syst) \\pm 0.0017\n(\\tau_{D})$ ps The last uncertainties originate from the limited knowledge of\nthe $B^0$ and $D^{-}$ lifetimes. The results improve upon current\ndeterminations.\n", "  Dark matter halo clustering depends not only on halo mass, but also on other\nproperties such as concentration and shape. This phenomenon is known broadly as\nassembly bias. We explore the dependence of assembly bias on halo definition,\nparametrized by spherical overdensity parameter, $\\Delta$. We summarize the\nstrength of concentration-, shape-, and spin-dependent halo clustering as a\nfunction of halo mass and halo definition. Concentration-dependent clustering\ndepends strongly on mass at all $\\Delta$. For conventional halo definitions\n($\\Delta \\sim 200\\mathrm{m}-600\\mathrm{m}$), concentration-dependent clustering\nat low mass is driven by a population of haloes that is altered through\ninteractions with neighbouring haloes. Concentration-dependent clustering can\nbe greatly reduced through a mass-dependent halo definition with $\\Delta \\sim\n20\\mathrm{m}-40\\mathrm{m}$ for haloes with $M_{200\\mathrm{m}} \\lesssim\n10^{12}\\, h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. Smaller $\\Delta$ implies larger radii and\nmitigates assembly bias at low mass by subsuming altered, so-called backsplash\nhaloes into now larger host haloes. At higher masses ($M_{200\\mathrm{m}}\n\\gtrsim 10^{13}\\, h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$) larger overdensities, $\\Delta\n\\gtrsim 600\\mathrm{m}$, are necessary. Shape- and spin-dependent clustering are\nsignificant for all halo definitions that we explore and exhibit a relatively\nweaker mass dependence. Generally, both the strength and the sense of assembly\nbias depend on halo definition, varying significantly even among common\ndefinitions. We identify no halo definition that mitigates all manifestations\nof assembly bias. A halo definition that mitigates assembly bias based on one\nhalo property (e.g., concentration) must be mass dependent. The halo\ndefinitions that best mitigate concentration-dependent halo clustering do not\ncoincide with the expected average splashback radii at fixed halo mass.\n", "  We study reversible deterministic dynamics of classical charged particles on\na lattice with hard-core interaction. It is rigorously shown that the system\nexhibits three types of transport phenomena, ranging from ballistic, through\ndiffusive to insulating. By obtaining an exact expressions for the current\ntime-autocorrelation function we are able to calculate the linear response\ntransport coefficients, such as the diffusion constant and the Drude weight.\nAdditionally, we calculate the long- time charge profile after an inhomogeneous\nquench and obtain diffusive profile with the Green-Kubo diffusion constant.\nExact analytical results are corroborated by Monte-Carlo simulations.\n", "  A new mathematical framework for the diagonalization of the nondiagonal\nvector--scalar and axial-vector--pseudoscalar mixing in the effective meson\nLagrangian is described. This procedure has unexpected connections with the\nHadamard product of $n\\times n$ matrices describing the couplings, masses, and\nfields involved. The approach is shown to be much more efficient as compared\nwith the standard methods employed previously. The difference is especially\nnoticeable if the chiral symmetry is broken explicitly. The paper ends with an\nillustrative application to the chiral model with broken $SU(3)_L\\times\nSU(3)_R$ symmetry.\n", "  The object of this interview is the history of the Large Hadron Collider in\nthe LEP tunnel at CERN, from first ideas to the discovery of the\nBrout-Englert-Higgs boson, seen from the point of view of a member of CERN\nscientific committees, of the CERN Council and a former Director General of\nCERN in the years of machine construction\n", "  We develop an alternative boson sampling model operating on single-photon\nstates followed by linear interferometry and Gaussian measurements. The\nhardness proof for simulating such continuous-variable measurements is\nestablished in two main steps, making use of the symmetry of quantum evolution\nunder time reversal. Namely, we first construct a twofold version of\nscattershot boson sampling in which, as opposed to the original proposal, both\nlegs of a collection of two-mode squeezed vacuum states undergo parallel\nlinear-optical transformations. This twofold scattershot model yields, as a\ncorollary, an instance of boson sampling from Gaussian states where photon\ncounting is hard to simulate. Then, a time-reversed setup is used to exhibit a\nboson sampling model in which the simulation of Gaussian measurements -- namely\nthe outcome of eight-port homodyne detection -- is proven to be computationally\nhard. These results illustrate how the symmetry of quantum evolution under time\nreversal may serve as a tool for analyzing the computational complexity of\nnovel physically-motivated computational problems.\n", "  One of the directly measured quantities which are used in monitoring the\norbital motions of many of the S stars revolving around the Supermassive Black\nHole (SMBH) in the Galactic Center (GC) is their radial velocity (RV) $V$\nobtained with near-infrared spectroscopy. Here, we devise a general approach to\ncalculate both the instantaneous variations $\\Delta V\\left(t\\right)$ and the\nnet shifts per revolution $\\left\\langle\\Delta V\\right\\rangle$ induced on such\nan observable by some post-Keplerian (pK) accelerations. In particular, we look\nat the general relativistic Schwarzschild (gravitoelectric) and Lense-Thirring\n(gravitomagnetic frame-dragging) effects, and the mass quadrupole. It turns out\nthat we may be on the verge of measuring the Schwarzschild-type 1pN static\ncomponent of the SMBH's field with the S2 star for which RV measurements\naccurate to about $\\simeq 30-50~\\textrm{km s}^{-1}$ dating back to $t_0 =\n2003.271$ are currently available, and whose orbital period amounts to\n$P_\\textrm{b} = 16$ yr. Indeed, while its expected general relativistic RV net\nshift per orbit amounts to just $\\left\\langle\\Delta V^\\textrm{GE}\\right\\rangle\n= -11.6~\\textrm{km s}^{-1}$, it should reach a peak value as large as $\\Delta\nV_\\textrm{max}^\\textrm{GE}\\left(t_\\textrm{max}\\right) = 551~\\textrm{km s}^{-1}$\nat $t_\\textrm{max} = 2018.35$. The periastron shift $\\Delta\\omega^\\textrm{GE}$\nof S2 over the same time span will not be larger than $0.2$ deg, while the\ncurrent accuracy in estimating such an orbital element for this star is of the\norder of $0.6$ deg. The frame-dragging and quadrupole-induced RV shifts are far\nsmaller for S2, amounting to, at most, $0.19~\\textrm{km\ns}^{-1},0.0039~\\textrm{km s}^{-1}$, respectively. Further studies should be\ndedicated to the impact on the RV of possible diffused mass distribution in the\nGC and of other individual stars inside and outside the orbit of S2.\n", "  We present a new process for fabricating vertical NbN-MgO-NbN Josephson\njunctions using self-aligned silicon nitride spacers. It allows for a wide\nrange of junction areas from 0.02 um^2 to several 100 um^2. At the same time,\nit is suited for the implementation of complex microwave circuits with\ntransmission line impedances ranging from < 1 Ohm to > 1 kOhm. The constituent\nthin films and the finished junctions are characterized. The latter are shown\nto have high gap voltages (> 4 mV) and low sub-gap leakage currents.\n", "  We construct explicit examples of globally regular static, spherically\nsymmetric solutions of general relativity with a phantom scalar field as the\nsource of gravity, describing traversable wormholes with flat asymptotic\nregions on both sides of the throat as well as regular black holes, in\nparticular, those called black universes. To explain why such phantom fields\nare not observed under usual conditions, we invoke the concept of \"invisible\nghosts,\" which means that the phantom field decays quickly enough at infinity\nand is there too weak to be observed. This approach leads to wormhole models in\nwhich the spherical radius is almost constant in some range of the radial\ncoordinate near the throat, forming a \"long throat\". We discuss the peculiar\nfeatures and difficulties of the stability problem for such configurations. It\nis shown that the limiting case of a \"maximally long throat\" has the form of an\nunstable model with the Nariai metric. This allows us to conjecture that a long\nthroat does not stabilize wormholes with a scalar source.\n", "  We present a more stringent upper limit on long-range axion-mediated forces\nobtained by the QUAX-g$_p$g$_s$ experiment, located at the INFN - Laboratori\nNazionali di Legnaro. We investigate the possible coupling between the electron\nspins of a paramagnetic GSO crystal and unpolarized nucleons of lead disks by\nmeasuring variations of GSO magnetization with a dc-SQUID magnetometer. Such an\ninduced magnetization can be interpreted as the effect of a long-range spin\ndependent interaction mediated by axions or Axion Like Particles (ALPs). The\ncorresponding coupling strength is proportional to the CP violating term\n$g_p^eg_s^N$, i.e. the product of the pseudoscalar and scalar coupling\nconstants of electron and nucleon, respectively. Previous upper limits are\nimproved by one order of magnitude, namely $g_p^eg_s^N/(\\hbar c) \\le\n4.3\\times10^{-30}$ at 95% confidence level, in the interaction range $10^{-3}$\nm $<\\lambda_a<0.2$ m. We eventually discuss our plans to improve the\nQUAX-g$_p$g$_s$ sensitivity by a few orders of magnitude, which will allow us\nto investigate the $\\vartheta\\simeq 10^{-10}$ range of CP-violating parameter\nand test some QCD axion models.\n", "  Recently, Liou, Mueller and Munier have argued that proton-nucleus collisions\nat the LHC may give access to the full statistics of the event-by-event\nfluctuations of the gluon density in the proton. Indeed, the number of\nparticles produced in an event in rapidity slices in the fragmentation region\nof the proton may, under some well-defined assumptions, be directly related to\nthe number of gluons which have a transverse momentum larger than the nuclear\nsaturation scale present in the proton at the time of the interaction with the\nnucleus. A first calculation of the probability distribution of the number of\ngluons in a hadron was performed, using the color dipole model. In this talk,\nwe review this proposal, and present preliminary numerical calculations which\nsupport the analytical results obtained so far.\n", "  Cross section predictions of W and Z bosons in association with jets (up to 6\njets, $W\\to\\ell^{\\pm}\\nu$ and $Z\\to\\ell^{\\pm}$ where $\\ell^{\\pm}$=$e^{\\pm}$ or\n$\\mu^{\\pm}$) in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV is performed\nusing Alpgen MC generator with CTEQ6L1 leading order parton distribution\nfunction. In addition, W and Z boson cross sections are obtained up to next to\nnext to leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections using MCFM MC generator. To\nvalidate the predictions, a detailed comparison of NNLO QCD calculations with 8\nTeV CMS results for total cross section is performed and a fiducial region is\nfurther defined to make a comparison of predictions with 7 TeV and 13 TeV ATLAS\nresults.\n", "  We present the survey strategy and early results of the \"Satellites Around\nGalactic Analogs\" (SAGA) Survey. The SAGA Survey's goal is to measure the\ndistribution of satellite galaxies around 100 systems analogous to the Milky\nWay down to the luminosity of the Leo I dwarf galaxy ($ M_r < -12.3 $). We\ndefine a Milky Way analog based on $K$-band luminosity and local environment.\nHere, we present satellite luminosity functions for 8 Milky Way analog galaxies\nbetween 20 to 40 Mpc. These systems have nearly complete spectroscopic coverage\nof candidate satellites within the projected host virial radius down to $ r_o <\n20.75 $ using low redshift $gri$ color criteria. We have discovered a total of\n25 new satellite galaxies: 14 new satellite galaxies meet our formal criteria\naround our complete host systems, plus 11 additional satellites in either\nincompletely surveyed hosts or below our formal magnitude limit. Combined with\n13 previously known satellites, there are a total of 27 satellites around 8\ncomplete Milky Way analog hosts. We find a wide distribution in the number of\nsatellites per host, from 1 to 9, in the luminosity range for which there are\nfive Milky Way satellites. Standard abundance matching extrapolated from higher\nluminosities predicts less scatter between hosts and a steeper luminosity\nfunction slope than observed. We find that the majority of satellites (26 of\n27) are star-forming. These early results indicate that the Milky Way has a\ndifferent satellite population than typical in our sample, potentially changing\nthe physical interpretation of measurements based only on the Milky Way's\nsatellite galaxies.\n", "  We have studied the spatial and temporal distribution of abundances of\nchemical elements in large \"gradual\" solar energetic-particle (SEP) events, and\nespecially the source plasma temperatures, derived from those abundances, using\nmeasurements from the Wind and Solar TErestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO)\nspacecraft, widely separated in solar longitude. A power-law relationship\nbetween abundance enhancements and mass-to-charge ratios [A/Q] of the ions can\nbe used to determine Q-values and source plasma temperatures at remote\nspacecraft with instruments that were not designed for charge-state\nmeasurements. We search for possible source variations along the accelerating\nshock wave, finding one clear case where the accelerating shock wave appears to\ndispatch ions from 3.2+-0.8 MK plasma toward one spacecraft and those from\n1.6+-0.2 MK plasma toward another, 116 deg away. The difference persists three\ndays and then fades away. Three other SEP events show less-extreme variation in\nsource temperatures at different spacecraft, in one case observed over 222 deg\nin longitude. This initial study shows how the power-law relation between\nabundance enhancements and ion A/Q-values pro-vides a new technique to\ndetermine Q and plasma temperatures in the seed population of SEP ions over a\nbroad region of space using remote spacecraft with instruments that were not\noriginally designed for measurements of ionization states.\n", "  Many young, massive stars are found in close binaries. Using population\nsynthesis simulations we predict the likelihood of a companion star being\npresent when these massive stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae\n(SNe). We focus on stripped-envelope SNe, whose progenitors have lost their\nouter hydrogen and possibly helium layers before explosion. We use these\nresults to interpret new Hubble Space Telescope observations of the site of the\nbroad-lined Type Ic SN 2002ap, 14 years post-explosion. For a subsolar\nmetallicity consistent with SN 2002ap, we expect a main-sequence companion\npresent in about two thirds of all stripped-envelope SNe and a compact\ncompanion (likely a stripped helium star or a white dwarf/neutron star/black\nhole) in about 5% of cases. About a quarter of progenitors are single at\nexplosion (originating from initially single stars, mergers or disrupted\nsystems). All the latter scenarios require a massive progenitor, inconsistent\nwith earlier studies of SN 2002ap. Our new, deeper upper limits exclude the\npresence of a main-sequence companion star $>8$-$10$ Msun, ruling out about 40%\nof all stripped-envelope SN channels. The most likely scenario for SN 2002ap\nincludes nonconservative binary interaction of a primary star initially\n$\\lesssim 23$ Msun. Although unlikely ($<$1% of the scenarios), we also discuss\nthe possibility of an exotic reverse merger channel for broad-lined Type Ic\nevents. Finally, we explore how our results depend on the metallicity and the\nmodel assumptions and discuss how additional searches for companions can\nconstrain the physics that governs the evolution of SN progenitors.\n", "  We investigate the sensitivity to weakly interacting scalar dark matter from\nfuture determination of electroweak oblique parameters in the Circular\nElectron-Positron Collider (CEPC) project. As illuminating examples, three dark\nmatter models with scalar electroweak multiplets are studied. The multiplet\ncouplings to the standard model Higgs doublet can break the mass degeneracy\namong the components, leading to nonzero contributions to oblique parameters.\nThe dark matter candidate in these model is either a CP-even or CP-odd scalar,\nwhose trilinear coupling to the Higgs boson could induce direct detection\nsignals. For some moderate coupling values, we find that the CEPC sensitivity\ncan be better than current direct detection experiments, exploring up to a TeV\nmass scale.\n", "  The interaction of laser cooled and trapped atoms with resonant light is\nlimited by the linewidth of the excited state of the atom. Another precise\noptical oscillator is an optical Fabry-P\\'erot cavity. The combining of cold\natoms with optical oscillators is emerging as an area with great potential for\nprecision measurements and the creation of versatile quantum optics systems.\nHere we show that when driven atoms are in the collectively strongly coupled\nregime with the cavity, exhibiting vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS), lasing is\nobserved for the emitted light, red detuned from atomic transition. This is\ndemonstrated experimentally by the observation of a lasing threshold,\npolarisation purity, mode purity, and line narrowing. The laser is created\nspontaneously by the atomic emission into the cavity mode, which stimulates\ncavity emission, and is capable of operating continuously without a seed laser.\nThe gain mechanism is understood by theoretical modelling and illustrates why\nthe observed lasing is generic to the coupled system. This opens up a range of\npossibilities of using the phenomenon for a variety of new measurements.\n", "  We study duality twisted reductions of the Double Field Theory (DFT) of the\nRR sector of massless Type II theory, with twists belonging to the duality\ngroup $Spin^+(10,10)$. We determine the action and the gauge algebra of the\nresulting theory and determine the conditions for consistency. In doing this,\nwe work with the DFT action constructed by Hohm, Kwak and Zwiebach, which we\nrewrite in terms of the Mukai pairing: a natural bilinear form on the space of\nspinors, which is manifestly $Spin(n,n)$ invariant. If the duality twist is\nintroduced via the $Spin^+(10,10)$ element $S$ in the RR sector, then the NS-NS\nsector should also be deformed via the duality twist $U = \\rho(S)$, where\n$\\rho$ is the double covering homomorphism between $Pin(n,n)$ and $O(n,n)$. We\nshow that the set of conditions required for the consistency of the reduction\nof the NS-NS sector are also crucial for the consistency of the reduction of\nthe RR sector, owing to the fact that the Lie algebras of $Spin(n,n)$ and\n$SO(n,n)$ are isomorphic. In addition, requirement of gauge invariance imposes\nan extra constraint on the fluxes that determine the deformations.\n", "  The Ryu-Takayanagi prescription reduces the problem of calculating\nentanglement entropy in CFTs to the determination of minimal surfaces in a dual\nanti-de Sitter geometry. For 3D gravity theories and BTZ black holes, we\nidentify the minimal surfaces as special Lagrangian cycles calibrated by the\nreal part of the holomorphic one-form of a spacelike hypersurface. We show that\n(generalised) calibrations provide a unified way to determine holographic\nentanglement entropy from minimal surfaces, which is applicable to warped\nAdS$_3$ geometries. We briefly discuss generalisations to higher dimensions.\n", "  We study the quantum phase transition between a paramagnetic and\nferromagnetic metal in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling in one\ndimension. Using bosonization, we analyze the transition by means of\nrenormalization group, controlled by an $\\varepsilon$-expansion around the\nupper critical dimension of two. We show that the presence of Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling allows for a new nonlinear term in the bosonized action, which\ngenerically leads to a fluctuation driven first-order transition. We further\ndemonstrate that the Euclidean action of this system maps onto a classical\nsmectic-A -- C phase transition in a magnetic field in two dimensions. We show\nthat the smectic transition is second-order and is controlled by a new critical\npoint.\n", "  We investigate if the topology of pure gauge fields in the electroweak vacuum\ncan play a role in classical dynamics at the electroweak phase transition. Our\nnumerical analysis shows that magnetic fields are produced if the initial\nvacuum has non-trivial Chern-Simons number, and the fields are helical if the\nChern-Simons number changes during the phase transition.\n", "  The basic tenet of the present work is the assumption of the lack of external\nand fixed time in the Universe. This assumption is best embodied by general\nrelativity, which replaces the fixed space-time structure with the\ngravitational field, which is subject to dynamics. The lack of time does not\nimply the lack of evolution but rather brings to the forefront the role of\ninternal clocks which are some largely arbitrary internal degrees of freedom\nwith respect to which the evolution of timeless systems can be described. We\ntake this idea seriously and try to understand what it implies for quantum\nmechanics when the fixed external time is replaced by an arbitrary internal\nclock. We put the issue in a solid, mathematically rigorous framework. We find\nthat the dynamical interpretation of a quantum state of a timeless system\ndepends on the employed internal clock. In particular, we find that the\ncontinuous spectra of well-known dynamical observables like the position of a\nfree particle on the real line may turn discrete if measured in unusual clocks.\nWe discuss the meaning of our result for attempts at quantization of global\ngravitational degrees of freedom.\n", "  Recently Wei et al (arXiv:1612.09425) have found evidence for a transition\nfrom positive time lags to negative time lags in the spectral lag data of GRB\n160625B. They have fit these observed lags to a sum of two components: an\nassumed functional form for intrinsic time lag due to astrophysical mechanisms\nand an energy-dependent speed of light due to quadratic and linear Loren tz\ninvariance violation (LIV) models. Here, we examine the statistical\nsignificance of the evidence for a transition to nega tive time lags. Such a\ntransition, even if present in GRB 160625B, cannot be due to an energy\ndependent speed of light as th is would contradict previous limits by some 3-4\norders of magnitude, and must therefore be of intrinsic astrophysical origin .\nWe use three different model comparison techniques: a frequentist test and two\ninformation based criteria (AIC and BIC). From the frequentist model comparison\ntest, we find that the evidence for transition in the spectral lag data is\nfavored at $3.05\\sigma$ and $3.74\\sigma$ for the linear and quadratic models\nrespectively. We find that $\\Delta$AIC and $\\Delta$BIC have values $\\gtrsim$ 10\nfor the spectral lag transition that was motivated as being due to quadratic\nLorentz invariance vio lating model pointing to \"decisive evidence\". We note\nhowever that none of the three models (including the model of intr insic\nastrophysical emission) provide a good fit to the data.\n", "  The transformation of powerful gravitational waves, created by the\ncoalescence of massive black hole binaries, into electromagnetic radiation in\nexternal magnetic fields is revisited. In contrast to the previous calculations\nof the similar effect, we study the realistic case of the gravitational\nradiation frequency below the plasma frequency of the surrounding medium. The\ngravitational waves propagating in the plasma constantly create electromagnetic\nradiation dragging it with them, despite the low frequency. The plasma heating\nby the unattenuated electromagnetic wave may be significant in a hot rarefied\nplasma with strong magnetic field and can lead to a noticeable burst of\nelectromagnetic radiation with higher frequency. The graviton-to-photon\nconversion effect in plasma is discussed in the context of possible\nelectromagnetic counterparts of GW150914 and GW170104.\n", "  We prove that one-dimensional elastic relativistic collisions satisfy the\nset-theoretical Yang-Baxter equation. The corresponding collision maps are\nsymplectic and admit a Lax representation. Furthermore, they can be considered\nas reductions of a higher dimensional integrable Yang-Baxter map on an\ninvariant manifold. In this framework, we study the integrability of transfer\nmaps that represent particular periodic sequences of collisions.\n", "  Viscoelasticity and related phenomena are of great importance in the study of\nmechanical properties of material especially, biological materials. Certain\nmaterials show some complex effects in mechanical tests, which cannot be\ndescribed by standard linear equation (SLE) mostly owing to shape memory effect\nduring deformation. Recently, researchers have been applying fractional\ncalculus in order for probing viscoelasticity of such materials with a high\nprecision. Fractional calculus is a powerful tool for modeling complex\nphenomenon. In this tutorial based paper, we try present clear descriptions of\nthe fractional calculus, its techniques and its implementation. The intention\nis to keep the details to a minimum while still conveying a good idea of what\nand how can be done with this powerful tool. We try to expose the reader to the\nbasic techniques that are used to solve the fractional equations analytically\nand/or numerically. More specifically, modeling the shape memory phenomena with\nthis powerful tool are studied from different perspectives, as well as\npresented some physical interpretation in this case. Moreover, in order to show\nthe relationship between fractional models and standard linear equations, a\nfractal system comprising spring and damper elements is considered, and the\nconstitutive equation is approximated with a fractional element. Finally, after\na brief literature review, two fractional models are utilized to investigate\nthe viscoelasticity of the cell, and the comparison is made among them,\nexperimental data, and previous models. Verification results indicate that not\nonly does the fractional model match the experimental data well, but it also\ncan be a good substitute for previously used models.\n", "  Quantum transport of electrons through a molecule is a series of individual\nelectron tunnelling events separated by stochastic waiting time intervals. We\nstudy the emergence of temporal correlations between successive waiting times\nfor the electron transport in a vibrating molecular junction. Using master\nequation approach, we compute joint probability distribution for waiting times\nof two successive tunnelling events. We show that the probability distribution\nis completely reset after each tunnelling event if molecular vibrations are\nthermally equilibrated. If we treat vibrational dynamics exactly without\nimposing the equilibration constraint, the statistics of electron tunnelling\nevents become non-renewal. Non-renewal statistics between two waiting times\n$\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_2$ means that the density matrix of the molecule is not\nfully renewed after time $\\tau_1$ and the probability of observing waiting time\n$\\tau_2$ for the second electron transfer depends on the previous electron\nwaiting time $\\tau_1$. The strong electron-vibration coupling is required for\nthe emergence of the non-renewal statistics. We show that in Franck-Condon\nblockade regime the extremely rare tunnelling events become positively\ncorrelated.\n", "  We present a Lagrangian theory of gravitation that develops some ideas\nproposed several years ago. It is formulated on the 10-dimensional space\n$\\mathcal{S}$ of the local Lorentz frames (tetrads) and it is covariant under\nthe symplectic group $Sp(4, \\mathbf{R})$, locally isomorphyic to the anti-de\nSitter group $SO(2, 3)$. The corresponding transformation formulas contain a\nconstant $ \\ell$, besides the light velocity $c$. We also assume the covariance\nunder the \"total dilatations\" of all the coordinates of the tangent spaces of\n$\\mathcal{S}$. These symmetries, that we may call \"augmented Lorentz\ncovariance\", are spontaneously broken and the corresponding (generalized)\nGoldstone fields, that we call \"augmentons\", behave as the components of a\n5-vector of $SO(2, 3)$. Its square can be interpreted as the Brans-Dicke scalar\nfield, that describes a variable gravitational coupling. The source of the\naugmentonic fields is provided by the Dirac fields. Finally, we discuss the\nphysical relevance of the theory and its possible further developments.\n", "  We present a comprehensive optical study of thin films of tungsten disulfide\n(WS$_2$) with layer thicknesses ranging from mono- to octalayer and in the bulk\nlimit. It is shown that the optical band-gap absorption of monolayer WS$_2$ is\ngoverned by competing resonances arising from one neutral and two distinct\nnegatively charged excitons whose contributions to the overall absorption of\nlight vary as a function of temperature and carrier concentration. The\nphotoluminescence response of monolayer WS$_2$ is found to be largely dominated\nby disorder/impurity- and/or phonon-assisted recombination processes. The\nindirect band-gap luminescence in multilayer WS$_2$ turns out to be a\nphonon-mediated process whose energy evolution with the number of layers\nsurprisingly follows a simple model of a two-dimensional confinement. The\nenergy position of the direct band-gap response (A and B resonances) is only\nweakly dependent on the layer thickness, which underlines an approximate\ncompensation of the effect of the reduction of the exciton binding energy by\nthe shrinkage of the apparent band gap. The A-exciton absorption-type spectra\nin multilayer WS$_2$ display a non-trivial fine structure which results from\nthe specific hybridization of the electronic states in the vicinity of the\nK-point of the Brillouin zone. The effects of temperature on the\nabsorption-like and photoluminescence spectra of various WS$_2$ layers are also\nquantified.\n", "  For a generic lattice Hamiltonian of the electron states in Weyl materials,\nwe calculate analytically the chiral (or, equivalently, valley) charge and\ncurrent densities in the first order in background electromagnetic and\nstrain-induced pseudoelectromagnetic fields. We find that the chiral response\ninduced by the pseudoelectromagnetic fields is not topologically protected.\nAlthough our calculations reproduce qualitatively the anomalous chiral Hall\neffect, the actual result for the conductivity depends on the definition of the\nchirality as well as on the parameters of the lattice model. In addition, while\nfor the well- separated Fermi surfaces surrounding the individual Weyl nodes\nthe current induced by the magnetic field coincides almost exactly with the\ncurrent of the chiral separation effect in linearized models, there are clear\ndeviations when the Fermi surfaces undergo the Lifshitz transition. In general,\nwe find that all chiral response coefficients vanish at large chemical\npotential.\n", "  Double neutron star (DNS) systems represent extreme physical objects and the\nendpoint of an exotic journey of stellar evolution and binary interactions.\nLarge numbers of DNS systems and their mergers are anticipated to be discovered\nusing the Square-Kilometre-Array searching for radio pulsars and high-frequency\ngravitational wave detectors (LIGO/VIRGO), respectively. Here we discuss all\nkey properties of DNS systems, as well as selection effects, and combine the\nlatest observational data with new theoretical progress on various physical\nprocesses with the aim of advancing our knowledge on their formation. We\nexamine key interactions of their progenitor systems and evaluate their\naccretion history during the high-mass X-ray binary stage, the common envelope\nphase and the subsequent Case BB mass transfer, and argue that the first-formed\nNSs have accreted at most $\\sim 0.02\\;M_{\\odot}$. We investigate DNS masses,\nspins and velocities, and in particular correlations between spin period,\norbital period and eccentricity. Numerous Monte Carlo simulations of the second\nsupernova (SN) events are performed to extrapolate pre-SN stellar properties\nand probe the explosions. All known close-orbit DNS systems are consistent with\nultra-stripped exploding stars. Although their resulting NS kicks are often\nsmall, we demonstrate a large spread in kick magnitudes which may, in general,\ndepend on the past interaction history of the exploding star and thus correlate\nwith the NS mass. We analyze and discuss NS kick directions based on our SN\nsimulations. Finally, we discuss the terminal evolution of close-orbit DNS\nsystems until they merge and possibly produce a short $\\gamma$-ray burst.\n", "  We investigate the probabilities of the tunneling and the radiation spectrums\nof the massive spin-1 particles from arbitrary dimensional Gauss-Bonnet-Axions\n(GBA) Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black brane, via using the WKB approximation to the\nProca spin-1 field equation. The tunneling probabilities and Hawking\ntemperature of the arbitrary dimensional GBA AdS black brane is calculated via\nthe Hamilton-Jacobi approach. We also compute the Hawking temperature via\nParikh-Wilczek tunneling approach. The results obtained from the two methods\nare consistent. In our setup, the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling affects the\nHawking temperature if and only if the momentum of axion fields is\nnon-vanishing.\n", "  Being a key ingredient of the AdS/CFT correspondence, AdS space-time is\nsuspected to be non-linearly unstable since 2011. Even with arbitrarily small\ninitial data, a singularity almost invariably emerges. However, some\nconfigurations allow for perfectly regular and quasi-periodic solutions. These\nare the so-called islands of stability. Among them, geons play the role of\npurely gravitational excitations of AdS space-time.\n  In this manuscript, we tackle the problem of the numerical construction of\nseveral families of asymptotically AdS geons. We are able to definitely\ndemonstrate the existence of the so-called excited geons, a point that was the\nsubject to a lively debate in the literature. We also detail how several\nfeatures of such space-times can be used as precision monitors and help us to\nvalidate numerics. Finally, we discuss in detail how geons shed new light on\nthe AdS instability problem.\n", "  We show that it is possible to use a quantum walk to find a path from one\nmarked vertex to another. In the specific case of $M$ stars connected in a\nchain, one can find the path from the first star to the last one in\n$O(M\\sqrt{N})$ steps, where $N$ is the number of spokes of each star. First we\nprovide an analytical result showing that by starting in a phase-modulated\nhighly superposed initial state we can find the path in $O(M\\sqrt{N}\\log M)$\nsteps. Next, we improve this efficiency by showing that the recovery of the\npath can also be performed by a series of successive searches when we start at\nthe last known position and search for the next connection in $O(\\sqrt{N})$\nsteps leading to the overall efficiency of $O(M\\sqrt{N})$. For this result we\nuse the analytical solution that can be obtained for a ring of stars of double\nthe length of the chain.\n", "  In this paper, we study the finite-temperature matrix quantum mechanics with\nchemical potential term linear in the single trace of U(N) matrices, via Monte\nCarlo simulation. In the bosonic case, we exhibit the existence of the\nGross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) type third-order phase transition. We also extend our\nstudies to the model with the fermionic degrees of freedom employing the\nnon-lattice simulation via Fourier expansion, and explore the possibilities\nthat there is a phase transition between the gapped and ungapped phase both in\nthe absence and presence of the chemical potential term. We make a comparison\nof the phase diagram between the bosonic and fermionic cases.\n", "  We study theoretically spin transport through a single-molecule magnet (SMM)\nin the sequential and cotunneling regimes, where the SMM is weakly coupled to\none ferromagnetic and one normalmetallic leads. By a master-equation approach,\nit is found that the spin polarization injected from the ferromagnetic lead is\namplified and highly polarized spin-current can be generated, due to the\nexchange coupling between the transport electron and the anisotropic spin of\nthe SMM. Moreover, the spin-current polarization can be tuned by the gate or\nbias voltage, and thus an efficient spin injection device based on the SMM is\nproposed in molecular spintronics.\n", "  We consider empirical multi-dimensional Rare Events Point Processes that keep\ntrack both of the time occurrence of extremal observations and of their\nseverity, for stochastic processes arising from a dynamical system, by\nevaluating a given potential along its orbits. This is done both in the absence\nand presence of clustering. A new formula for the piling of points on the\nvertical direction of bi-dimensional limiting point processes, in the presence\nof clustering, is given, which is then generalised for higher dimensions. The\nlimiting multi-dimensional processes are computed for systems with sufficiently\nfast decay of correlations. The complete convergence results are used to study\nthe effect of clustering on the convergence of extremal processes, record time\nand record values point processes. An example where the clustering prevents the\nconvergence of the record times point process is given.\n", "  Vertically stacked van der Waals heterostructures are a lucrative platform\nfor exploring the rich electronic and optoelectronic phenomena in\ntwo-dimensional materials. Their performance will be strongly affected by\nimpurities and defects at the interfaces. Here we present the first systematic\nstudy of interfaces in van der Waals heterostructure using cross sectional\nscanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) imaging. By measuring\ninterlayer separations and comparing these to density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations we find that pristine interfaces exist between hBN and MoS2 or WS2\nfor stacks prepared by mechanical exfoliation in air. However, for two\ntechnologically important transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) systems, MoSe2\nand WSe2, our measurement of interlayer separations provide the first evidence\nfor impurity species being trapped at buried interfaces with hBN: interfaces\nwhich are flat at the nanometer length scale. While decreasing the thickness of\nencapsulated WSe2 from bulk to monolayer we see a systematic increase in the\ninterlayer separation. We attribute these differences to the thinnest TMDC\nflakes being flexible and hence able to deform mechanically around a sparse\npopulation of protruding interfacial impurities. We show that the air sensitive\ntwo dimensional (2D) crystal NbSe2 can be fabricated into heterostructures with\npristine interfaces by processing in an inert-gas environment. Finally we find\nthat adopting glove-box transfer significantly improves the quality of\ninterfaces for WSe2 compared to processing in air.\n", "  Broad-band exoplanet transit photometry can characterize the planetary\natmosphere when observed at multiple selected filters. This observing technique\ncan reveal gradients in the spectra of extrasolar planets, for example the\nslope of decreasing opacity from short to long optical wavelengths caused by\naerosol scattering. In this work we observed a transit of the hot Jupiter\nHAT-P-32 b in the shortest wavelength possible from the ground using the Large\nBinocular Telescope (LBT). The data comprise the best-quality ground-based\nU-band taken so far of an exoplanet transit. Compared to broad-band\nobservations of intermediate and long optical wavelength published previously,\na clear scattering slope in the planetary transmission spectrum is revealed.\nMost likely, the scattering particles are magnesium silicate aerosols larger\nthan 0.1 micrometer. We define a spectral index to compare this scattering\nfeature of HAT-P-32 b to published results of other exoplanets. It turns out to\nbe very typical in amplitude within the comparison sample. Furthermore, we\nsearched for correlation in this sample of the spectral index with planetary\nequilibrium temperature, surface acceleration and stellar activity indicator,\nbut could not reveal any.\n", "  The antidynamical Casimir effect (ADCE) is a term coined to designate the\ncoherent annihilation of excitations due to resonant external perturbation of\nsystem parameters, allowing for extraction of quantum work from nonvacuum\nstates of some field. Originally proposed for a two-level atom (qubit) coupled\nto a single cavity mode in the context of nonstationary quantum Rabi model, it\nsuffered from very low transition rate and correspondingly narrow resonance\nlinewidth. In this paper we show analytically and numerically that the ADCE\nrate can be increased by at least one order of magnitude by replacing the qubit\nby an artificial three-level atom (qutrit) in a properly chosen configuration.\nFor the cavity thermal state we demonstrate that the dynamics of the average\nphoton number and atomic excitation is completely different from the qubit's\ncase, while the behavior of the total number of excitations is qualitatively\nsimilar yet significantly faster.\n", "  We use an atomic fountain clock to measure quantum scattering phase shifts\nprecisely through a series of narrow, low-field Feshbach resonances at average\ncollision energies below $1\\,\\mu$K. Our low spread in collision energy yields\nphase variations of order $\\pm \\pi/2$ for target atoms in several $F,m_F$\nstates. We compare them to a theoretical model and establish the accuracy of\nthe measurements and the theoretical uncertainties from the fitted potential.\nWe find overall excellent agreement, with small statistically significant\ndifferences that remain unexplained.\n", "  Graph states have been used for quantum error correction by Schlingemann et\nal. [Physical Review A 65.1 (2001): 012308]. Hypergraph states [Physical Review\nA 87.2 (2013): 022311] are generalizations of graph states and they have been\nused in quantum algorithms. We for the first time demonstrate how hypergraph\nstates can be used for quantum error correction. We also point out that they\nare more efficient than graph states in the sense that to correct equal number\nof errors on the same graph topology, suitably defined hypergraph states\nrequire less number of gate operations than the corresponding graph states.\n", "  The analytical study of long wave scattering in a canal with a rapidly\nvarying cross-section is presented. It is assumed that waves propagate on a\nstationary current with a given flow rate. Due to the fixed flow rate, the\ncurrent speed is different in the different sections of the canal, upstream and\ndownstream. The scattering coefficients (the transmission and reflection\ncoefficients) are calculated for all possible orientations of incident wave\nwith respect to the background current (downstream and upstream propagation)\nand for all possible regimes of current (subcritical, transcritical, and\nsupercritical). It is shown that in some cases negative energy waves can appear\nin the process of waves scattering. The conditions are found when the\noverreflection and over-transmission phenomena occur. In particular, it is\nshown that a spontaneous wave generation can arise in a trans-critical\naccelerating flow, when the background current enhances due to the canal\nnarrowing. This resembles a spontaneous wave generation on the horizon of an\nevaporating black hole due to the Hawking effect.\n", "  In this review, we retrace the recent progress in the anti-de Sitter (AdS)\ninstability problem. By instability we mean that for large classes of initial\ndata, any perturbation of AdS space-time, however small, leads to the formation\nof a black hole. Since the seminal work of Bizo\\'n and Rostworowski in 2011,\nmany different kinds of numerical experiments were performed in asymptotically\nAdS space-times, unveiling a very intricate structure of the instability. In\nparticular, many efforts were dedicated to the search of islands of stability,\ni.e.\\ families of initial data that resist black hole formation. Many\nanalytical and numerical tools were deployed to disentangle stable from\nunstable initial data, and shed new light on the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for collapse. Recently, research beyond spherical symmetry became\nmore and more engaged. This is a very promising channel of investigation toward\na deeper understanding of the gravitational dynamics in asymptotically AdS\nspace-times.\n", "  Detections of coalescing binary black holes by LIGO have opened a new window\nof transient astronomy. With increasing sensitivity of LIGO and participation\nof the Virgo detector in Cascina, Italy, we expect to soon detect coalescence\nof compact binary systems with one or more neutron stars. These are the prime\ntargets for electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave triggers, which\nholds enormous promise of rich science. However, hunting for electromagnetic\ncounterparts of gravitational wave events is a non-trivial task due to the\nsheer size of the error regions, which could span hundreds of square degrees.\nThe Zwicky Transient facility (ZTF), scheduled to begin operation in 2017, is\ndesigned to cover such large sky-localization areas. In this work, we present\nthe strategies of efficiently tiling the sky to facilitate the observation of\nthe gravitational wave error regions using ZTF. To do this we used simulations\nconsisting of 475 binary neutron star coalescences detected using a mix of two-\nand three-detector networks. Our studies reveal that, using two overlapping\nsets of ZTF tiles and a (modified) ranked-tiling algorithm, we can cover the\ngravitational-wave sky-localization regions with half as many pointings as a\nsimple contour-covering algorithm. We then incorporated the ranked-tiling\nstrategy to study our ability to observe the counterparts. This requires\noptimization of observation depth and localization area coverage. Our results\nshow that observation in r-band with ~600 seconds of integration time per\npointing seems to be optimum for typical assumed brightnesses of\nelectromagnetic counterparts, if we plan to spend equal amount of time per\npointing. However, our results also reveal that we can gain by as much as 50%\nin detection efficiency if we linearly scale our integration time per pointing\nbased on the tile probability.\n", "  The band structure of many semiconducting monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) possesses two degenerate valleys, with equal and\nopposite Berry curvature. It has been predicted that, when illuminated with\ncircularly polarized light, interband transitions generate an unbalanced\nnon-equilibrium population of electrons and holes in these valleys, resulting\nin a finite Hall voltage at zero magnetic field when a current flows through\nthe system. This is the so-called valley Hall effect that has recently been\nobserved experimentally. Here, we show that this effect is mediated by\nphoto-generated neutral excitons and charged trions, and not by inter-band\ntransitions generating independent electrons and holes. We further demonstrate\nan experimental strategy, based on wavelength dependent spatial mapping of the\nHall voltage, which allows the exciton and trion contributions to the valley\nHall effect to be discriminated in the measurement. These results represent a\nsignificant step forward in our understanding of the microscopic origin of\nphoto-induced valley Hall effect in semiconducting transition metal\ndichalcogenides, and demonstrate experimentally that composite quasi-particles,\nsuch as trions, can also possess a finite Berry curvature.\n", "  We investigated quantum critical behaviours in the non-equilibrium steady\nstate of a $XXZ$ spin chain with boundary Markovian noise using the Fisher\ninformation. The latter represents the distance between two infinitesimally\nclose states, and its superextensive size scaling witnesses a critical\nbehaviour due to a phase transition, since all the interaction terms are\nextensive. Perturbatively in the noise strength, we found superextensive Fisher\ninformation at anisotropy $|\\Delta|\\leqslant1$ and irrational\n$\\frac{\\arccos\\Delta}{\\pi}$ irrespective of the order of two non-commuting\nlimits, i.e. the thermodynamic limit and the limit of sending\n$\\frac{\\arccos\\Delta}{\\pi}$ to an irrational number via a sequence of rational\napproximants. From this result we argue the existence of a non-equilibrium\nquantum phase transition with a critical phase $|\\Delta|\\leqslant1$. From the\nnon-superextensivity of the Fisher information of reduced states, we infer that\nthis non-equilibrium quantum phase transition does not have local order\nparameters but has non-local ones, at least at $|\\Delta|=1$. In the\nnon-perturbative regime for the noise strength, we numerically computed the\nreduced Fisher information which lower bounds the full state Fisher\ninformation, and is superextensive only at $|\\Delta|=1$. Form the latter\nresult, we derived local order parameters at $|\\Delta|=1$ in the\nnon-perturbative case. The existence of critical behaviour witnessed by the\nFisher information in the phase $|\\Delta|<1$ is still an open problem. The\nFisher information also represents the best sensitivity for any estimation of\nthe control parameter, in our case the anisotropy $\\Delta$, and its\nsuperextensivity implies enhanced estimation precision which is also highly\nrobust in the presence of a critical phase.\n", "  Electricity plays a special role in our lives and life. Equations of electron\ndynamics are nearly exact and apply from nuclear particles to stars. These\nMaxwell equations include a special term the displacement current (of vacuum).\nDisplacement current allows electrical signals to propagate through space.\nDisplacement current guarantees that current is exactly conserved from inside\natoms to between stars, as long as current is defined as Maxwell did, as the\nentire source of the curl of the magnetic field. We show how the Bohm\nformulation of quantum mechanics allows easy definition of current. We show how\nconservation of current can be derived without mention of the polarization or\ndielectric properties of matter. Matter does not behave the way physicists of\nthe 1800's thought it does with a single dielectric constant, a real positive\nnumber independent of everything. Charge moves in enormously complicated ways\nthat cannot be described in that way, when studied on time scales important\ntoday for electronic technology and molecular biology. Life occurs in ionic\nsolutions in which charge moves in response to forces not mentioned or\ndescribed in the Maxwell equations, like convection and diffusion. Classical\nderivations of conservation of current involve classical treatments of\ndielectrics and polarization in nearly every textbook. Because real dielectrics\ndo not behave in a classical way, classical derivations of conservation of\ncurrent are often distrusted or even ignored. We show that current is conserved\nexactly in any material no matter how complex the dielectric, polarization or\nconduction currents are. We believe models, simulations, and computations\nshould conserve current on all scales, as accurately as possible, because\nphysics conserves current that way. We believe models will be much more\nsuccessful if they conserve current at every level of resolution, the way\nphysics does.\n", "  We review the measurements of magnetic fields of OBA stars. Based on these\ndata we confirm that magnetic fields are distributed according to a lognormal\nlaw with a mean log(B)=-0.5 (B in kG) with a standard deviation sigma=0.5. The\nshape of the magnetic field distribution is similar to that for neutron stars.\nThis finding is in favor of the hypothesis that the magnetic field of a neutron\nstar is determined mainly by the magnetic field of its predecessor, the massive\nOB star. Further, we model the evolution of an ensemble of magnetic massive\nstars in the Galaxy. We use our own population synthesis code to obtain the\ndistribution of stellar radii, ages, masses, temperatures, effective magnetic\nfields and magnetic fluxes from the pre-main sequence (PMS) via zero age main\nsequence (ZAMS) up to the terminal age main sequence (TAMS) stages. A\ncomparison of the obtained in our model magnetic field distribution (MFD) with\nthat obtained from the recent measurements of the stellar magnetic field allows\nus to conclude that the evolution of magnetic fields of massive stars is slow\nif not absent. The shape of the real MFD shows no indications of the magnetic\ndesert proposed previously. Based on this finding we argue that the observed\nfraction of magnetic stars is determined by physical conditions at the PMS\nstage of stellar evolution.\n", "  We employ the framework of affine covariant quantization and associated\nsemiclassical portrait to address two main issues in the domain of quantum\ngravitational systems: (i) the fate of singularities and (ii) the lack of\nexternal time. Our discussion is based on finite-dimensional, symmetry-reduced\ncosmological models. We show that the affine quantization of the cosmological\ndynamics removes the classical singularity and univocally establishes a unitary\nevolution. The semiclassical portrait based on the affine coherent states\nexhibits a big bounce replacing the big-bang singularity. As a particularly\ninteresting application, we derive and study a unitary quantum dynamics of the\nspatially homogenous, closed model, the Mixmaster universe. At the classical\nlevel it undergoes an infinite number of oscillations before collapsing into a\nbig-crunch singularity. At the quantum level the singularity is shown to be\nreplaced by adiabatic and nonadiabatic bounces. As another application, we\nconsider the problem of time. We derive semiclassical portraits of quantum\ndynamics of the Friedman universe with respect to various internal degrees of\nfreedom. Next we compare them and discuss the nature of quantum evolution of\nthe gravitational field.\n", "  Parasitic two-level tunneling systems (TLS) emerge in amorphous dielectrics\nand constitute a serious nuisance for various microfabricated devices, where\nthey act as a source of noise and decoherence. Here, we demonstrate a new test\nbed for the study of TLS in various materials which provides access to\nproperties of individual TLS as well as their ensemble response. We terminate a\nsuperconducting transmission-line resonator with a capacitor that hosts TLS in\nits dielectric. By tuning TLS via applied mechanical strain, we observe the\nsignatures of individual TLS strongly coupled to the resonator in its\ntransmission characteristics and extract the coupling components of their\ndipole moments and energy relaxation rates. The strong and well-defined\ncoupling to the TLS bath results in pronounced resonator frequency fluctuations\nand excess phase noise, through which we can study TLS ensemble effects such as\nspectral diffusion, and probe theoretical models of TLS interaction.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will perform a survey of the whole\nGalactic disk with unprecedented sensitivity at energies up to 300 TeV. One of\nthe key science projects of the CTA consortium is the discovery of Galactic\nPeVatrons (cosmic ray accelerators to PeV energies). The determination of\nefficient criteria to identify PeVatron candidates during the Galactic plane\nsurvey observations is essential in order to trigger deeper observations. This\ncontribution presents a method which relies on the broadband spectrum of the\nsource to investigate high energy spectral features. The application of this\nmethod to specific sources will also be presented.\n", "  In this paper we present our response to the comments by Andrianov and\nMityushev regarding a recent publication of ours on the determination of the\neffective thermal conductivity of multiscale ordered arrays.\n", "  Small system sizes are a well known source of error in DFT calculations, yet\ncomputational constraints frequently dictate the use of small supercells, often\nas small as 96 atoms in oxides and compound semiconductors. In ionic compounds,\nelectrostatic finite size effects have been well characterised, but\nself-interaction of charge neutral defects is often discounted or assumed to\nfollow an asymptotic behaviour and thus easily corrected with linear elastic\ntheory. Here we show that elastic effects are also important in the description\nof defects in ionic compounds and can lead to qualitatively incorrect\nconclusions if inadequately small supercells are used; moreover, the spurious\nself-interaction does not follow the behaviour predicted by linear elastic\ntheory. Considering the exemplar cases of metal oxides with fluorite structure,\nwe show that numerous previous studies, employing 96-atom supercells,\nmisidentify the ground state structure of (charge neutral) Schottky defects. We\nshow that the error is eliminated by employing larger cells (324, 768 and 1500\natoms), and careful analysis determines that elastic effects, not\nelectrostatic, are responsible. The spurious self-interaction was also observed\nin non-oxide ionic compounds and irrespective of the computational method used,\nthereby resolving long standing discrepancies between DFT and force-field\nmethods, previously attributed to the level of theory. The surprising magnitude\nof the elastic effects are a cautionary tale for defect calculations in ionic\nmaterials, particularly when employing computationally expensive methods or\nwhen modelling large defect clusters. We propose two computationally\npracticable methods to test the magnitude of the elastic self-interaction in\nany ionic system.\n", "  The physical significance of tidal deformation in astronomical systems has\nlong been known. The recently discovered universal I-Love-Q relations, which\nconnect moment of inertia, quadrupole tidal Love number, and spin-induced\nquadrupole moment of compact stars, also underscore the special role of tidal\ndeformation in gravitational wave astronomy. Motivated by the observation that\nsuch relations also prevail in Newtonian stars and crucially depend on the\nstiffness of a star, we consider the tidal Love numbers of Newtonian polytropic\nstars whose stiffness is characterised by a polytropic index $n$. We first\nperturbatively solve the Lane-Emden equation governing the profile of\npolytropic stars through the application of the scaled delta expansion method\nand then formulate perturbation series for the multipolar tidal Love number\nabout the two exactly solvable cases with $n=0$ and $n=1$, respectively. Making\nuse of these two series to form a two-point Pad\\'e approximant, we find an\napproximate expression of the quadrupole tidal Love number, whose error is less\nthan $2.5 \\times 10^{-5}$ per cent (0.39 per cent) for $n\\in[0,1]$\n($n\\in[0,3]$). Similarly, we also determine the mass moments for polytropic\nstars accurately. Based on these findings, we are able to show that the\nI-Love-Q relations are in general stationary about the incompressible limit\nirrespective of the equation of state (EOS) of a star. Moreover, for the\nI-Love-Q relations, there is a secondary stationary point near $n \\approx\n0.4444$, thus showing the insensitivity to $n$ for $n\\in[0,1]$. Our\ninvestigation clearly tracks the universality of the I-Love-Q relations from\ntheir validity for stiff stars such as neutron stars to their breakdown for\nsoft stars.\n", "  The renormalization of entanglement entropy of quantum field theories is\ninvestigated in the simplest setting with a $\\lambda \\phi^4$ scalar field\ntheory. The 3+1 dimensional spacetime is separated into two regions by an\ninfinitely flat 2-dimensional interface. The entanglement entropy of the system\nacross the interface has an elegant geometrical interpretation using the\nreplica trick, which requires putting the field theory on a curved spacetime\nbackground. We demonstrate that the theory, and hence the entanglement entropy,\nis renormalizable at order $\\lambda$ once all the relevant operators up to\ndimension-4 are included in the action. This exercise has a one-to-one\ncorrespondence to entanglement entropy interpretation of the black hole entropy\nwhich suggests that our treatment is sensible. Our study suggests that\nentanglement entropy is renormalizable and is a physical quantity.\n", "  We derive a unified quantum theory of coherent and incoherent energy transfer\nbetween two atoms (donor and acceptor) valid in arbitrary Markovian\nnanophotonic environments. Our theory predicts a fundamental bound $\\eta_{max}\n= \\frac{\\gamma_a}{\\gamma_d + \\gamma_a}$ for energy transfer efficiency arising\nfrom the spontaneous emission rates $\\gamma_{d}$ and $\\gamma_a$ of the donor\nand acceptor. We propose the control of the acceptor spontaneous emission rate\nas a new design principle for enhancing energy transfer efficiency. We predict\nan experiment using mirrors to enhance the efficiency bound by exploiting the\ndipole orientations of the donor and acceptor. Of fundamental interest, we show\nthat while quantum coherence implies the ultimate efficiency bound has been\nreached, reaching the ultimate efficiency does not require quantum coherence.\nOur work paves the way towards nanophotonic analogues of efficiency enhancing\nenvironments known in quantum biological systems.\n", "  The connection between contextuality and graph theory has led to many\ndevelopments in the field. In particular, the sets of probability distributions\nin many contextuality scenarios can be described using well known convex sets\nfrom graph theory, leading to a beautiful geometric characterization of such\nsets. This geometry can also be explored in the definition of contextuality\nquantifiers based on geometric distances, which is important for the resource\ntheory of contextuality, developed after the recognition of contextuality as a\npotential resource for quantum computation. In this paper we review the\ngeometric aspects of contextuality and use it to define several quantifiers,\nwhich have the advantage of being applicable to the exclusivity approach to\ncontextuality, where previously defined quantifiers do not fit.\n", "  In this work, we proposed new shape nanoparticles in the name of supershape\nnanoparticles by manipulation in the morphology of a disk nanoparticle. The\nelectric field distribution of supershape nanoparticles were investigated at\nresonance wavelength of particle plasmons. The effects of dispersed medium and\ndifferent sensory materials on particle plasmons were reported. The obtained\nresults showed that there exist the multiple plasmonics modes in supershape\nnanoparticles. We found that the high sensitivity factor is available in the\nsupershape nanoparticles. This study can be a base for the characterization of\nmultiple particle plasmons in plasmonic devices for sensing applications.\n", "  SiC materials are potential plasma facing materials in fusion reactors. In\nthis study, site preference and diffusion behaviors of H in pure 3C-\\b{eta} SiC\nand in He-implanted 3C-\\b{eta} SiC are investigated, on the basis of the\nfirst-principles calculations. We find that the most stable sites for H in pure\n3C-\\b{eta}SiC is the anti-bond site of C (ABc) in Si-C, while it becomes the\nbond-center (BC) site of Si-C bonds in the He-implanted 3C-\\b{eta} SiC.\nAnalysis on the electronic structures reveals that such change is attributed to\nthe reduction of hybridization of C-Si bonds induced by He. Moreover, the\npresence of He strongly affect the vibrational features in the high frequency\nregion, causing a blue shift of 25 cm-1 for C-H stretch mode with H at ABc site\nand a red shift of 165cm-1 for that at BC site, with respect to that in the\npure system. In pure 3C-\\b{eta} SiC, H is diffusive with an energy cost of\nabout 0.5 eV, preferring to rotate around the C atom in a Si-C tetrahedron with\nan energy barrier of just about 0.10 eV. In contrast, in He-implanted\n3C-\\b{eta} SiC, the energy barriers for H migration goes up to be about 0.95\neV, indicating the implanted-He blocks the diffusive H to some extent. Our\ncalculations also show that the influence of He on H diffusion is effective in\na short range, just covering the nearest neighbor.\n", "  Besides the conventional strong and electromagnetic decay modes, the\n$J/{\\psi}$ particle can also decay via the weak interaction in the standard\nmodel. In this paper, nonleptonic $J/{\\psi}$ ${\\to}$ $D_{s,d}{\\pi}$, $D_{s,d}K$\nweak decays, corresponding to the externally emitted virtual $W$ boson process,\nare investigated with the perturbative QCD approach. It is found that branching\nratio for the Cabibbo-favored $J/{\\psi}$ ${\\to}$ $D_{s}{\\pi}$ decay can reach\nup to ${\\cal O}(10^{-10})$, which might be potentially measurable at the future\nhigh-luminosity experiments.\n", "  The ${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}^{\\ast}D$ weak decays ($n$ $=$ $1$, $2$,\n$3$) are investigated with perturbative QCD approach. It is found that the\nCKM-favored ${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}^{\\ast}D_{s}$ decays have branching\nratio of ${\\cal O}(10^{-10})$, which might be potentially accessible to the\nfuture LHC and SuperKEKB experiments.\n", "  An atomic-scale theory of the viscoelastic response of metallic glasses is\nderived from first principles, using a Zwanzig-Caldeira-Leggett system-bath\nHamiltonian as a starting point within the framework of nonaffine linear\nresponse to mechanical deformation. This approach provides a\nGeneralized-Langevin-Equation (GLE) as the average equation of motion for an\natom or ion in the material, from which non-Markovian nonaffine viscoelastic\nmoduli are extracted. These can be evaluated using the vibrational density of\nstates (DOS) as input, where the boson peak plays a prominent role for the\nmechanics. To compare with experimental data of binary ZrCu alloys, numerical\nDOS was obtained from simulations of this system, which take also electronic\ndegrees of freedom into account via the embedded atom method (EAM) for the\ninteratomic potential. It is shown that the viscoelastic $\\alpha$-relaxation,\nincluding the $\\alpha$-wing asymmetry in the loss modulus, can be very well\ndescribed by the theory if the memory kernel (the non-Markovian friction) in\nthe GLE is taken to be a stretched-exponential decaying function of time. This\nfinding directly implies strong memory effects in the atomic-scale dynamics,\nand suggests that the $\\alpha$-relaxation time is related to the characteristic\ntime-scale over which atoms retain memory of their previous collision history.\nThis memory time grows dramatically below the glass transition.\n", "  The paper examines the prominent algorithm D-MORPH to search for the optimal\ncontrol of a quantum system in order to implement desired unitary evolution of\nthe quantum system at the final time, and reveals new mathematical expressions\nfor various orders' corrections to the algorithm, that include information\nabout the commutators of the system's Hamiltonian. Inclusion of such\ncorrections results in faster optimal quantum control's search with high\nprecision, i.e. allows saving of computational resources.\n", "  The Fermilab Muon Campus will host the Muon g-2 experiment - a world class\nexperiment dedicated to the search for signals of new physics. Strict demands\nare placed on beam diagnostics in order to ensure delivery of high quality\nbeams to the storage ring with minimal losses. In this study, we briefly\ndescribe the available secondary beam diagnostics for the Fermilab Muon Campus.\nThen, with the aid of numerical simulations we detail their interaction with\nthe secondary beam. Finally, we compare our results against theoretical\nfindings.\n", "  We report on a room-temperature photodetector utilizing semimetal bismuth\nnanowire arrays coupled with graphene. The structural flatness and high\nelectron mobility of graphene exhibit great potential for future generations of\nelectronic materials. Bismuth nanowire arrays coupled with graphene have strong\nabsorption because of light trapping. Bismuth (Bi), as a semimetal, complements\ngraphene's gapless and mobility characteristics. Bi also features a long\nscreening length (4 nm) comparable to semiconductors. Raman spectroscopy is\nused to characterize the charge transfer between graphene and Bi. The analyzed\nspectrum includes the visible (350 nm) through the near infrared (980 nm) and\nwell into the telecommunication band (1550 nm). Because of photocarrier pair\ngeneration and transfer at the interface, the photocurrent generated by the\ninterface built-in field is robust without sacrificing the detection spectrum.\nWe observe a power-law frequency dependence of the photoresponse over three\norder of magnitude of excitation frequency consistent with a wide distribution\nof diffusion times. These key properties may enable application of the\njunctions of graphene with Bi in detector and light harvesting applications.\n", "  Semiconductor heterostructures have played a critical role as the enabler for\nnew science and technology. The emergence of transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMDs) as atomically thin semiconductors has opened new frontiers in\nsemiconductor heterostructures either by stacking different TMDs to form\nvertical heterojunctions or by stitching them laterally to form lateral\nheterojunctions via direct growth. In conventional semiconductor\nheterostructures, the design of multi-junctions is critical to achieve carrier\nconfinement. Analogously, we report successful synthesis of monolayer\nWS2/WS2(1-x)Se2x/WS2 multi-junction lateral heterostructure via direct growth\nby chemical vapor deposition. The grown structures are characterized by Raman,\nphotoluminescence, and annular dark-field scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy to determine its lateral compositional profile. More importantly,\nusing microwave impedance microscopy, we demonstrate that the local\nphotoconductivity in the alloy region can be tailored and enhanced by 2 orders\nof magnitude over pure WS2. Finite element analysis confirms that this effect\nis due to the carrier diffusion and confinement into the alloy region. Our work\nexemplifies the technological potential of atomically thin lateral\nheterostructures in optoelectronic applications.\n", "  In this paper we present a thermodynamically consistent material model which\nis capable of modelling ductile-to brittle failure mode transition in ductile\nmaterial undergoing deformations at high strain rates, and demonstrate the\nperformance of the model in a numerical study using a fully coupled\nthermal-structural finite element analysis of a notched aluminium alloy\nspecimen loaded in cyclic tension. The model is based on an objective\nrepresentation of the deformation and stress measures and on a rate type\nconstitutive equations. It does not only complies with the principles of\nmaterial modelling, but it also uses constitutive equations, evolution\nequations and even \"normality rules\" during return mapping which can be\nexpressed in terms of power conjugate stress and strain measures, or their\nobjective rates.\n", "  Quantum contextuality turns out to be a necessary resource for universal\nquantum computation and important in the field of quantum information\nprocessing. It is therefore of interest both for theoretical considerations and\nfor experimental implementation to find new types and instances of contextual\nsets and develop methods of their optimal generation. We present an arbitrary\nexhaustive hypergraph-based generation of the most explored contextual\nsets---Kochen-Specker (KS) ones---in 4, 6, 8, 16, and 32 dimensions. We\nconsider and analyse twelve KS classes and obtain numerous properties of\ntheirs, which we then compare with the results previously obtained in the\nliterature. We generate several thousand times more types and instances of KS\nsets than previously known. All KS sets in three of the classes and in the\nupper part of a fourth are novel. We make use of the MMP hypergraph language,\nalgorithms, and programs to generate KS sets strictly following their\ndefinition from the Kochen-Specker theorem. This approach proves to be\nparticularly advantageous over the parity-proof-based ones (which prevail in\nthe literature), since it turns out that only a very few KS sets have a parity\nproof (in six KS classes 0.01% and in one of them 0%). MMP hypergraph formalism\nenables a translation of an exponentially complex task of solving systems of\nnonlinearequations, describing KS vector orthogonalities, into a statistically\nlinearly complex task of evaluating vertex states of hypergraph edges, thus\nexponentially speeding up the generation of KS sets and enabling us to generate\nbillions of novel instances of them. The MMP hypergraph notation also enables\nus to graphically represent KS sets and to visually discern their features.\n", "  The primary mechanism of the atomic Kapitza-Dirac effect is a multi-photon\nprocess in which the electronic state is virtually excited while the direct\nproduct state is altered as the velocity of the atom undergoes spatial\nquantization. The Bragg resonance is a virtual multi-photon stimulated Raman\nscattering in which couterpropagating photons act as pump and probe imparting\ntransverse velocity to the atom through recoil while the energy in the field is\nlowered such that the energy of the system is conserved. The bulk of the\nliterature for the past three decades has presumed that the\nenergy-nonconserving intermediate states which are described by non-adiabatic\ncontributions could be neglected once the perturbative effects of next-order\noff-resonant states were included. This paper demonstrates the necessity of\nincluding higher-order non-adiabatic contributions of energy-nonconserving\nmomentum states in calculating the final populations of Bragg resonances as a\nfunction of field strength. As the field strength is increased, the\nPendell\\\"{o}sung frequency varies while generally decreasing dramatically,\nrequiring a greater number of intermediate states to calculate. This paper\ndemonstrates that $n\\propto\\sqrt{\\beta/\\delta}$ states must be included to\nprecisely calculate the populations of diffracted atoms as a function of field\nstrength in better agreement with experiment.\n", "  The fragmentation dynamics of predissociative SO2(C1B2) is investigated on an\naccurate adiabatic potential energy surface (PES) determined from high level ab\ninitio data. This singlet PES features non-C2v equilibrium geometries for SO2,\nwhich are separated from the SO + O dissociation limit by a barrier resulting\nfrom a conical intersection with a repulsive singlet state. The ro-vibrational\nstate distribution of the SO fragment is determined quantum mechanically for\nmany predissociative states of several sulfur isotopomers of SO2. Significant\nrotational and vibrational excitations are found in the SO fragment. It is\nshown that these fragment internal state distributions are strongly dependent\non the predissociative vibronic states, and the excitation typically increases\nwith the photon energy.\n", "  Suspensions of self-propelled bodies generate a unique mechanical stress\nowing to their motility that impacts their large-scale collective behavior. For\nmicroswimmers suspended in a fluid with negligible particle inertia, we have\nshown that the virial `swim stress' is a useful quantity to understand the\nrheology and nonequilibrium behaviors of active soft matter systems. For larger\nself-propelled organisms like fish, it is unclear how particle inertia impacts\ntheir stress generation and collective movement. Here, we analyze the effects\nof finite particle inertia on the mechanical pressure (or stress) generated by\na suspension of self-propelled bodies. We find that swimmers of all scales\ngenerate a unique `swim stress' and `Reynolds stress' that impacts their\ncollective motion. We discover that particle inertia plays a similar role as\nconfinement in overdamped active Brownian systems, where the reduced run length\nof the swimmers decreases the swim stress and affects the phase behavior.\nAlthough the swim and Reynolds stresses vary individually with the magnitude of\nparticle inertia, the sum of the two contributions is independent of particle\ninertia. This points to an important concept when computing stresses in\ncomputer simulations of nonequilibrium systems---the Reynolds and the virial\nstresses must both be calculated to obtain the overall stress generated by a\nsystem.\n", "  The recent discovery of ferromagnetic single-layer CrI3 creates ample\nopportunities for studying fundamental properties of atomically-thin magnets.\nBy using first-principles calculations and model analysis, we show that a\nlateral strain and/or charge doping can have unexpected effects on the magnetic\nproperties of CrI3. In particular, strain tunes the magnetic order and\nanisotropy: (1) a compressive strain leads to a phase transition from a\nferromagnetic insulator to an antiferromagnetic insulator, while (2) a tensile\nstrain can flip the magnetic orientation from off-plane to in-plane.\nInterestingly, we find that the phase boundary for the first transition is\ninsensitive to charge doping, whereas that of the second one can be\nsignificantly modulated by electron doping.\n", "  Cratering on small bodies is crucial for the collision cascade and also\ncontributes to the ejection of dust particles into interplanetary space. A\ncrater cavity forms against the mechanical strength of the surface,\ngravitational acceleration, or both. The formation of moderately sized craters\nthat are sufficiently larger than the thickness of the regolith on small\nbodies, in which mechanical strength plays the dominant role rather than\ngravitational acceleration, is in the strength regime. The formation of\nmicrocraters on blocks on the surface is also within the strength regime. On\nthe other hand, the formation of a crater of a size comparable to the thickness\nof the regolith is affected by both gravitational acceleration and cohesion\nbetween regolith particles. In this short review, we compile data from the\nliterature pertaining to impact cratering experiments on porous targets, and\nsummarize the ratio of spall diameter to pit diameter, the depth, diameter, and\nvolume of the crater cavity, and the ratio of depth to diameter. Among targets\nwith various porosities studied in the laboratory to date, based on\nconventional scaling laws (Holsapple and Schmidt, J. Geophys. Res., 87,\n1849-1870, 1982) the cratering efficiency obtained for porous sedimentary rocks\n(Suzuki et al., J. Geophys. Res. 117, E08012, 2012) is intermediate. A\ncomparison with microcraters formed on a glass target with impact velocities up\nto 14 $km s^{-1}$ indicates a different dependence of cratering efficiency and\ndepth-to-diameter ratio on impact velocity.\n", "  We measured the optical conductivity of superconducting single crystals of\nBa$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ with $x$ ranging from 0.40 (optimal doping,\n$T_c = 39$ K) down to 0.20 (underdoped, $T_c = 16$ K), where a magnetic order\ncoexists with superconductivity. In the normal state, the low-frequency optical\nconductivity can be described by an incoherent broad Drude component and a\ncoherent narrow Drude component: the broad one is doping-independent, while the\nnarrow one shows strong scattering in the heavily underdoped compound. In the\nsuperconducting state, the formation of the condensate leads to a low-frequency\nsuppression of the optical conductivity spectral weight. In the heavily\nunderdoped region, the superfluid density is significantly suppressed, and the\nweight of unpaired carriers rapidly increases. We attribute these results to\nchanges in the superconducting gap across the phase diagram, which could show a\nnodal-to-nodeless transition due to the strong interplay between magnetism and\nsuperconductivity in underdoped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$.\n", "  Intervals between electrical pulses generated by the electrical activity\nproduced by the motor units of an external anal sphincter were studied at four\ntime intervals during multimodal rectal cancer treatment. Probability\ndistribution function of such intervals does not exhibit significant\ndifferences for all considered time intervals. It is found that the probability\ndistribution rescaled with an average interval time can be described by means\nof the stretched exponential function with the threshold dependent scale and\nshape parameters. Interval trains possess rather strong correlations as their\nshuffled counterparts show exponential Poisson like probability distribution.\nFinally the clustering effects were not found as the conditional probability\ndistributions can also be described by the exponential function.\n", "  Computation is a central aspect of modern science and engineering work, and\nyet, computational instruction has yet to fully pervade university STEM\ncurricula. In physics, we have begun to integrate computation into our courses\nin a variety of ways. Here, we discuss a method for integrating computation\ninto calculus-based mechanics where the lecture and laboratory for the course\nare decoupled. At Michigan State University, we have developed a \"lecture\"\ncourse, called \"Projects and Practices in Physics\", where science and\nengineering students solve complex problems in groups of four using analytical\nand computational techniques. In this paper, we provide details on the\ncomputational instruction, activities, and assessment used to teach these\nintroductory students how to model motion using VPython.\n", "  A theory describing the forces governing the self-assembly of nanoparticles\nat the solid-liquid interface is developed. In the process, new theoretical\nresults are derived to describe the effect that the field penetration of a\npoint-like particle, into an electrode, has on the image potential energy, and\npair interaction energy profiles at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The\napplication of the theory is demonstrated for gold and ITO electrode systems,\npromising materials for novel colour-tuneable electrovariable smart mirrors and\nmirror-window devices respectively. Model estimates suggest that\nelectrovariability is attainable in both systems and will act as a guide for\nfuture experiments. Lastly, the generalisability of the theory towards\nelectrovariable, nanoplasmonic systems suggests that it may contribute towards\nthe design of intelligent metamaterials with programmable properties.\n", "  Hopping charge transport in amorphous semiconductors having spatially\ncorrelated exponential density of states has been considered. Average carrier\nvelocity is exactly calculated for the quasi-equilibrium (nondispersive)\ntransport regime. We suggest also a heuristic approach for the consideration of\nthe carrier velocity for the non-equilibrium dispersive regime.\n", "  Expression for the probability of induced emission of high-order harmonics is\nobtained in the region where the multiphoton approximation is applicable to the\ndescription of the ionization of an atom. The dependence of this probability on\nthe main parameters of the pump wave and the atomic medium is established.\nCriteria for observing emission are formulated with the consideration of phase\nlocking. The possibility of amplifying a UV probe wave aimed through the region\nwhere the atoms interact with the pump wave is considered.\n", "  The fluorescence of silicon clusters is reviewed. Atomic clusters of silicon\nhave been at the focus of research for several decades because of the relevance\nof size effects for material properties, the importance of silicon in\nelectronics and the potential applications in bio-medicine. To date numerous\nexamples of nanostructured forms of fluorescent silicon have been reported.\nThis article introduces the principles and underlying concepts relevant for\nfluorescence of nanostructured silicon such as excitation, energy relaxation,\nradiative and non-radiative decay pathways and surface passivation.\nExperimental methods for the production of silicon clusters are presented. The\ngeometric and electronic properties are reviewed and the implications for the\nability to emit fluorescence are discussed. Free and pure silicon clusters\nproduced in molecular beams appear to have properties that are unfavourable for\nlight emission. However, when passivated or embedded in a suitable host, they\nmay emit fluorescence. The current available data show that both quantum\nconfinement and localised transitions, often at the surface, are responsible\nfor fluorescence. By building silicon clusters atom by atom, and by embedding\nthem in shells atom by atom, new insights into the microscopic origins of\nfluorescence from nanoscale silicon can be expected.\n", "  This is a preface introducing a Special Issue on the topic of \"Guided-Wave\nOptics\" published by Applied Sciences. The Special Issue is a collection of 20\noriginal and review articles dealing with various fundamental and applied\naspects of the topic.\n", "  Natural abundance of sodium and its similar behavior to lithium triggered\nrecent extensive studies of cost-effective sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) for\nlarge-scale energy storage systems. A challenge is to develop electrode\nmaterials with a high electrode potential, specific capacity and a good rate\ncapability. In this work we propose mixed eldfellite compounds\n\\ce{Na_x(Fe_{1/2}M_{1/2})(SO4)2} (M = Mn, Co, Ni) as a new family of high\nelectrode potential cathodes of SIBs and present their material properties\npredicted by first-principles calculations. The structural optimizations show\nthat these materials have significantly small volume expansion rates below 5\\%\nupon Na insertion/desertion with negative Na binding energies. Through the\nelectronic structure calculations, we find band insulating properties and hole\n(and/or electron) polaron hoping as a possible mechanism for the charge\ntransfer. Especially we confirm the high electrode voltages over 4 V with\nreasonably high specific capacities. We also investigate the sodium ion\nmobility by estimating plausible diffusion pathways and calculating the\ncorresponding activation barriers, demonstrating the reasonably fast migrations\nof sodium ions during the operation. Our calculation results indicate that\nthese mixed eldfellite compounds can be suitable materials for high performance\nSIB cathodes.\n", "  The Canarias InfraRed Camera Experiment (CIRCE) is a near-infrared (1-2.5\nmicron) imager, polarimeter and low-resolution spectrograph operating as a\nvisitor instrument for the Gran Telescopio Canarias 10.4-meter telescope. It\nwas designed and built largely by graduate students and postdocs, with help\nfrom the UF astronomy engineering group, and is funded by the University of\nFlorida and the U.S. National Science Foundation. CIRCE is intended to help\nfill the gap in near-infrared capabilities prior to the arrival of EMIR to the\nGTC, and will also provide the following scientific capabilities to compliment\nEMIR after its arrival: high-resolution imaging, narrowband imaging,\nhigh-time-resolution photometry, imaging polarimetry, low resolution\nspectroscopy. In this paper, we review the design, fabrication, integration,\nlab testing, and on-sky performance results for CIRCE. These include a novel\napproach to the opto-mechanical design, fabrication, and alignment.\n", "  To understand the essential physics needed to reproduce magnetic reconnection\nevents in 2.5-D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we revisit the Geospace\nEnvironmental Modeling (GEM) setup. We set up a 2-D Harris current sheet (that\nalso specifies the initial conditions) to evolve the reconnection of\nantiparallel magnetic fields. In contrast to the GEM setup, we use a much\nsmaller initial perturbation to trigger the reconnection and evolve it more\nself-consistently. From PIC simulation data with high-quality particle\nstatistics we study a symmetric reconnection site, including separatrix layers,\nas well as the inflow and the outflow regions. The velocity distribution\nfunctions (VDFs) of electrons have a fine structure and vary strongly depending\non their location within the reconnection setup. The goal is to start\ncataloging multidimensional fine-structured electron velocity distributions\nshowing different reconnection processes in the Earth's magnetotail under\nvarious conditions. This will enable a direct comparison with observations\nfrom, e.g., the NASA Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission, to identify\nreconnection-related events. We find regions with strong non-gyrotropy also\nnear the separatrix layer and provide a refined criterion to identify an\nelectron diffusion region in the magnetotail. The good statistical significance\nof this work for relatively small analysis areas reveals the gradual changes\nwithin the fine structure of electron VDFs depending on their sampling site.\n", "  A modified-Bloch equation based on the fractal derivative is proposed to\nanalyze pulsed field gradient (PFG) anomalous diffusion. Anomalous diffusion\nexists in many systems such as in polymer or biological systems. PFG anomalous\ndiffusion could be analyzed based on the fractal derivative or the fractional\nderivative. Compared to the fractional derivative, the fractal derivative is\nsimpler, and it is faster in numerical evaluations. In this paper, the fractal\nderivative is employed to build the modified-Bloch equation that is a\nfundamental method to describe the spin magnetization evolution affected by\nfractional diffusion, Larmor precession, and relaxation. An equivalent form of\nthe fractal derivative is proposed to convert the fractional diffusion\nequation, which can then be combined with the precession and relaxation\nequations to get the modified-Bloch equation. This modified-Bloch equation\nyields a general PFG signal attenuation expression that includes the finite\ngradient pulse width (FGPW) effect, namely, the signal attenuation during field\ngradient pulse. The FGPW effect needs to be considered in most clinical MRI\napplications, and including FGPW effect allows the detecting of slower\ndiffusion that is often encountered in polymer systems. Additionally, the\nspin-spin relaxation effect can be analyzed, which provides a broad view of the\ndynamic process in materials. The modified-Bloch equation based on the fractal\nderivative could provide a fundamental theoretical model for PFG anomalous\ndiffusion.\n", "  This paper presents two different electrostatic gyrokinetic models derived\nthrough two different perturbative methods. One of the two models is just the\nconventional electrostatic gyrokinetic model, the derivation of which is\nrepeated using the Lie transform perturbative method. One term is rectified in\nthe derivation of the conventional model. To derive the other model, we use a\nnew method, which is based on the covariant transform formula of the\ndifferential 1-form. The new method doesn't split the coordinate transform into\nthe guiding-center transform and the gyrocenter transform. It carries out the\ncoordinate transform up to the order equaling that of the amplitude of the\nperturbative wave. Compared with the conventional model, the finite Larmor\nradius terms are completely removed from the orbit equations of the new one,\nmaking it simpler for the numerical application.\n", "  The new method is considered for identifying the perfect (optimal) scenario\nof climate engineering operations based on the optimal control theory. The\napplication of this approach is demonstrated using zero-dimensional\nenergy-balance climate model. The global average surface temperature represents\nthe state variable and the reflective power of aerosols injected into the\nstratosphere is designated as the control variable. Maximum principle is used\nto find the best possible control and the associated climate system trajectory\nfor a specific objective function (performance measure). Discussed illustrative\nresults were analytically and numerically calculated using the four greenhouse\ngas concentration scenarios based on the Representative Concentration Pathways.\n", "  Molecular dynamics is based on solving Newton's equations for many-particle\nsystems that evolve along complex, highly fluctuating trajectories. The orbital\ninstability and short-time complexity of Newtonian orbits is in sharp contrast\nto the more coherent behavior of collective modes such as density profiles. The\nnotion of virtual molecular dynamics is introduced here based on temporal\ncoarse-graining via Pade approximants and the Ito formula for stochastic\nprocesses. It is demonstrated that this framework leads to significant\nefficiency over traditional molecular dynamics and avoids the need to introduce\ncoarse-grained variables and phenomenological equations for their evolution. In\nthis framework, an all-atom trajectory is represented by a Markov chain of\nvirtual atomic states at a discrete sequence of timesteps, transitions between\nwhich are determined by an integration of conventional molecular dynamics with\nPade approximants and a microstate energy annealing methodology. The latter is\nachieved by a conventional and an MD NVE energy minimization schemes. This\nmultiscale framework is demonstrated for a pertussis toxin subunit undergoing a\nstructural transition, a T=1 capsid-like structure of HPV16 L1 protein, and two\ncoalescing argon droplets.\n", "  In non-central heavy-ion collisions unprecedented strong magnetic fields, of\nthe order of 10$^{18}$ Gauss, are expected to be produced. The interplay of\nsuch fields with QCD anomalies in the Quark--Gluon Plasma (QGP) has been\npredicted to lead to a number of interesting phenomena, such as the Chiral\nMagnetic Effect (CME). While several experimental observations are partially\nconsistent with predictions of a CME signal, it is hard to distinguish them\nunambiguously from a combination of more mundane phenomena present in the\nanisotropic expansion of the QGP. This makes it imperative to establish that\nthe early-time magnetic field has observable consequences not related to the\nanomalous QCD effects on final-state charged particles and to calibrate its\nstrength. We test a recent prediction of a pure electromagnetic effect, which\nmay arise in heavy-ion collisions. The varying magnetic field would induce a\ncurrent within the QGP, which is expected to leave a very peculiar imprint on\nfinal-state particles: a contribution to directed flow which is asymmetric both\nin charge and pseudorapidity. We report the measurement of the charge\ndependence of directed flow with respect to the spectator plane for\nunidentified charged particles in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\text{NN}} =\n5.02$ TeV.\n", "  Shale gas plays an important role in reducing pollution and adjusting the\nstructure of world energy. Gas content estimation is particularly significant\nin shale gas resource evaluation. There exist various estimation methods, such\nas first principle methods and empirical models. However, resource evaluation\npresents many challenges, especially the insufficient accuracy of existing\nmodels and the high cost resulting from time-consuming adsorption experiments.\nIn this research, a low-cost and high-accuracy model based on geological\nparameters is constructed through statistical learning methods to estimate\nadsorbed shale gas content\n", "  In this work we have used focused electron beam induced deposition of cobalt\nto functionalize atomic force microscopy Akiyama tips for application in\nmagnetic force microscopy. The grown tips have a content of 90% Co after\nexposure to ambient air. The magnetic tips were characterized using energy\ndispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. In order to\ninvestigate the magnetic properties, current loops were prepared by electron\nbeam lithography. Measurements at room temperature as well as 4.2K were carried\nout and the coercive field of 68 Oe of the Co tip was estimated by applying\nseveral external fields in the opposite direction of the tip magnetization.\nMagnetic Akiyama tips open new possibilities for low to room-temperature\nmagnetic force microscopy measurements.\n", "  Helical molecules change their twist number under the effect of a mechanical\nload. We study the twist-stretch relation for a set of short DNA molecules\nmodeled by a mesoscopic Hamiltonian. Finite temperature path integral\ntechniques are applied to generate a large ensemble of possible configurations\nfor the base pairs of the sequence. The model also accounts for the bending and\ntwisting fluctuations between adjacent base pairs along the molecules stack.\nSimulating a broad range of twisting conformation, we compute the helix\nstructural parameters by averaging over the ensemble of base pairs\nconfigurations. The method selects, for any applied force, the average twist\nangle which minimizes the molecule's free energy. It is found that the chains\ngenerally over-twist under an applied stretching and the over-twisting is\nphysically associated to the contraction of the average helix diameter, i.e. to\nthe damping of the base pair fluctuations. Instead, assuming that the maximum\namplitude of the bending fluctuations may decrease against the external load,\nthe DNA molecule first over-twists for weak applied forces and then untwists\nabove a characteristic force value. Our results are discussed in relation to\navailable experimental information albeit for kilo-base long molecules.\n", "  Many processes of spreading and diffusion take place on temporal networks,\nand their outcomes are influenced by correlations in the times of contact.\nThese correlations have a particularly strong influence on processes where the\nspreading agent has a limited lifetime at nodes: disease spreading (recovery\ntime), diffusion of rumors (lifetime of information), and passenger routing\n(maximum acceptable time between transfers). Here, we introduce weighted event\ngraphs as a powerful and fast framework for studying connectivity determined by\ntime-respecting paths where the allowed waiting times between contacts have an\nupper limit. We study percolation on the weighted event graphs and in the\nunderlying temporal networks, with simulated and real-world networks. We show\nthat this type of temporal-network percolation is analogous to directed\npercolation, and that it can be characterized by multiple order parameters.\n", "  In this short note we consider semi-Markov processes satisfying the condition\nof direction-time independence (Markov renewal processes). We derive large\ndeviation principles and fluctuation theorems for the empirical current and the\nempirical currents along cycles. Our derivation is based on the joint LDP for\nthe empirical measure and flow recently proved in \\cite{MZ}.\n", "  In this paper we study a monolithic Newton-Krylov solver with exact Jacobian\nfor the solution of incompressible FSI problems. A main focus of this work is\non the use of geometric multigrid preconditioners with modified Richardson\nsmoothers preconditioned by an additive Schwarz algorithm. The definition of\nthe subdomains in the Schwarz smoother is driven by the natural splitting\nbetween fluid and solid. The monolithic approach guarantees the automatic\nsatisfaction of the stress balance and the kinematic conditions across the\nfluid-solid interface. The enforcement of the incompressibility conditions both\nfor the fluid and for the solid parts is taken care of by using inf-sup stable\nfinite element pairs without stabilization terms. A suitable Arbitrary\nLagrangian Eulerian (ALE) operator is chosen in order to avoid mesh\nentanglement while solving for large displacements of the moving fluid domain.\nNumerical results of two and three-dimensional benchmark tests with Newtonian\nfluids and nonlinear hyperelastic solids show a robust performance of our fully\nincompressible solver especially for the more challenging\ndirect-to-steady-state problems.\n", "  Nonlinear simulation model for radio frequency (RF) waves in fusion plasmas\nhas been developed and verified using fully kinetic ion and drift kinetic\nelectron. Ion cyclotron motion in the toroidal geometry is implemented using\nBoris push in the Boozer coordinates. Linear dispersion relation and nonlinear\nparticle trapping are verified for the lower hybrid (LH) wave and ion Bernstein\nwave (IBW). Parametric decay instability is observed where a large amplitude\npump wave decays into an IBW sideband and an ion cyclotron quasimode (ICQM).\nThe ICQM induces an ion perpendicular heating with a heating rate proportional\nto the pump wave intensity.\n", "  We describe a procedure for constructing a model of a smooth data spectrum\nusing Gaussian processes rather than the historical parametric description.\nThis approach considers a fuller space of possible functions, is robust at\nincreasing luminosity, and allows us to incorporate our understanding of the\nunderlying physics. We demonstrate the application of this approach to modeling\nthe background to searches for dijet resonances at the Large Hadron Collider\nand describe how the approach can be used in the search for generic localized\nsignals.\n", "  Numerical simulations based on Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS)\nequations are widely used in engineering design and analysis involving\nturbulent flows. However, RANS simulations are known to be unreliable in many\nflows of engineering relevance, which is largely caused by model-form\nuncertainties associated with the Reynolds stresses. Recently, a\nmachine-learning approach has been proposed to assist RANS modeling by building\na functional mapping from mean flow features to discrepancies in RANS modeled\nReynolds stresses as compared to high-fidelity data. However, it remains a\nchallenge to represent discrepancies in the Reynolds stress eigenvectors in\nmachine learning due to the requirements of spatial smoothness,\nframe-independence, and realizability. In this work, we propose three schemes\nfor representing perturbations to the eigenvectors of RANS modeled Reynolds\nstresses: (1) discrepancy-based Euler angles, (2) direct-rotation-based Euler\nangles, and (3) unit quaternions. We compare these metrics by performing a\npriori and a posteriori tests on two canonical flows: fully developed turbulent\nflows in a square duct and massively separated flows over periodic hills. The\nresults demonstrate that the direct-rotation-based Euler angles representation\nlacks spatial smoothness while the discrepancy-based Euler angles\nrepresentation lacks frame-independence, making them unsuitable for being used\nin machine-learning-assisted turbulence modeling. In contrast, the\nrepresentation based on unit quaternion satisfies all the requirements stated\nabove, and thus it is an ideal choice in representing the perturbations\nassociated with the eigenvectors of Reynolds stress tensors. This finding has\nclear importance for uncertainty quantification and machine learning in\nturbulence modeling and for data-driven computational mechanics in general.\n", "  We combine confocal imaging, microfluidics and image analysis to record\n3D-images of cells in flow. This enables us to recover the full 3D\nrepresentation of several hundred living cells per minute. Whereas 3D confocal\nimaging has thus far been limited to steady specimen, we overcome this\nrestriction and present a method to access the 3D shape of moving objects. The\nkey of our principle is a tilted arrangement of the micro-channel with respect\nto the focal plane of the microscope. This forces cells to traverse the focal\nplane in an inclined manner. As a consequence, individual layers of passing\ncells are recorded which can then be assembled to obtain the volumetric\nrepresentation. The full 3D information allows for a detailed comparisons with\ntheoretical and numerical predictions unfeasible with e.g.\\ 2D imaging. Our\ntechnique is exemplified by studying flowing red blood cells in a micro-channel\nreflecting the conditions prevailing in the microvasculature. We observe two\nvery different types of shapes: `croissants' and `slippers'. Additionally, we\nperform 3D numerical simulations of our experiment to confirm the observations.\nSince 3D confocal imaging of cells in flow has not yet been realized, we see\nhigh potential in the field of flow cytometry where cell classification thus\nfar mostly relies on 1D scattering and fluorescence signals.\n", "  The most luminous quasars (with bolometric luminosities are 1E47 erg/s) show\na high prevalence of CIV {\\lambda}1549 and [OIII]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}4959,5007\nemission line profiles with strong blueshifts. Blueshifts are interpreted as\ndue to Doppler effect and selective obscuration, and indicate outflows\noccurring over a wide range of spatial scales. We found evidence in favor of\nthe nuclear origin of the outflows diagnosed by [OIII]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}\n4959,5007. The ionized gas mass, kinetic power, and mechanical thrust are\nextremely high, and suggest widespread feedback effects on the host galaxies of\nvery luminous quasars, at cosmic epochs between 2 and 6 Gyr from the Big Bang.\nIn this mini-review we summarize results obtained by our group and reported in\nseveral major papers in the last few years with an eye on challenging aspects\nof quantifying feedback effects in large samples of quasars.\n", "  This is a continuation of our work to understand vertex operator algebras\nusing the geometric properties of varieties attached to vertex operator\nalgebras. For a class of vertex operator algebras including affine vertex\noperator algebras associated to a finite dimensional simple Lie algebra\n$\\mathfrak{g}$, we describe their varieties of semi-conformal vectors by some\nmatrix equations. These matrix equations are too complicated to be solved for\nus. However, for affine vertex operator algebras associated to the simple Lie\nalgebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we find the adjoint group $G$ of $\\mathfrak{g}$ acts on\nthe corresponding varieties by a natural way, which implies that such varieties\nshould be described more clearly by studying the corresponding $G$-orbit\nstructures. Based on above methods for general cases, as an example,\nconsidering affine vertex operator algebras associated to the Lie algebra\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{C})$, we shall give the decompositions of $G$-orbits\nof varieties of their semi-conformal vectors according to different levels. Our\nresults imply that such orbit structures depends on the levels of affine vertex\noperator algebras associated to a finite dimensional simple Lie algebra\n$\\mathfrak{g}$\n", "  We are interested in the phenomenon of the essential spectrum instability for\na class of unbounded (block) Jacobi matrices. We give a series of sufficient\nconditions for the matrices from certain classes to have a discrete spectrum on\na half-axis of a real line. An extensive list of examples showing the sharpness\nof obtained results is provided.\n", "  The lifetimes of non-covalent A:a knob-hole bonds in fibrin probed with the\noptical trap-based force-clamp first increases (\"catch bonds\") and then\ndecreases (\"slip bonds\") with increasing tensile force. Molecular modeling of\n\"catch-to-slip\" transition using the atomic structure of the A:a complex\nreveals that the movable flap serves as tension-dependent molecular switch.\nFlap dissociation from the regulatory B-domain in $\\gamma$-nodule and\ntranslocation from the periphery to knob `A' triggers the hole `a' closure and\ninterface remodeling, which results in the increased binding affinity and\nprolonged bond lifetimes. Fluctuating bottleneck theory is developed to\nunderstand the \"catch-to-slip\" transition in terms of the interface stiffness\n$\\kappa =$ 15.7 pN nm $^{-1}$, interface size fluctuations 0.7-2.7 nm, knob `A'\nescape rate constant $k_0 =$ 0.11 nm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, and transition distance for\ndissociation $\\sigma_y =$ 0.25 nm. Strengthening of the A:a knob-hole bonds\nunder small tension might favor formation and reinforcement of nascent fibrin\nclots under hydrodynamic shear.\n", "  The interaction between the electromagnetic field and plasmonic\nnanostructures leads to both the strong linear response and inherent nonlinear\nbehavior. In this paper, a time-domain hydrodynamic model for describing the\nmotion of electrons in plasmonic nanostructures is presented, in which both\nsurface and bulk contributions of nonlinearity are considered. A coupled\nMaxwell-hydrodynamic system capturing full-wave physics and free electron\ndynamics is numerically solved with the parallel finite-difference time-domain\n(FDTD) method. The validation of the proposed method is presented to simulate\nlinear and nonlinear responses from a plasmonic metasurface. The linear\nresponse is compared with the Drude dispersion model and the nonlinear\nterahertz emission from a difference-frequency generation process is validated\nwith theoretical analyses. The proposed scheme is fundamentally important to\ndesign nonlinear plasmonic nanodevices, especially for efficient and broadband\nTHz emitters.\n", "  Given the experimental precision and the multitude of processes that can be\nmeasured at the LHC, electroweak (EW) corrections become more and more\nrelevant. This calls for the automatisation of EW corrections and in particular\ntheir implementations in multi-purpose Monte Carlo generators in order to allow\nfor a systematic study of such contributions. In these proceedings I present\nthe implementation of the matrix-element generator Recola in the Sherpa Monte\nCarlo. The combination Sherpa+Recola allows to compute, in principle, any\nprocess in the Standard Model at NLO QCD and EW accuracy. In addition to\nfixed-order NLO computations, all functionalities of Sherpa such as parton\nshower or hadronisation are still available.\n", "  The TeV gamma ray sky is observable by recording footprints of extensive air\nshowers with an array of particle detectors. In the northern hemisphere there\nare currently two projects employing this technique: The HAWC gamma ray\nobservatory which is currently operational in Mexico and LHAASO in the Sichuan\nregion in China which is currently under development. In the southern\nhemisphere several efforts are currently ongoing to investigate the feasibility\nof a similar observatory at very high altitude sites in the Andes. The science\ncase for such an observatory should be complementary to the science to be\nperformed by the future Cherenkov Telescope Array. There are two clear\ndirections in which such an observatory could optimize its performance.\nFirstly, optimize the performance of sub-TeV energies. This is especially\nimportant to provide an unbiased monitoring of a large fraction of the sky for\nobservations of transient and extended sources. Secondly, to obtain the largest\nphoton statistics above roughly 50 TeV, which requires a large collection area\nwith sufficient performance in angular and energy resolution. This would enable\nto extend spectral measurements of Galactic sources and gives the opportunity\nto search for dark matter and exotic physics in a new energy range. Using\nsimulated air showers and a generalized detector description the performance of\na conceptual observatory is studied and the ways to optimize it will be\ndiscussed. With this approach the baseline design of such an observatory can be\nobtained without the need of detailed simulations of the detector hardware.\n", "  We study the degree of second-order coherence of the emission of a high-power\nmulti-quantum well superluminescent diode with a lateral tapered amplifier\nsection with and without feedback. When operated in an external cavity, the\ndegree of second-order coherence changed from the almost thermal case of\ng$^{(2)}$(0)$\\approx$1.9 towards the mostly coherent case of\ng$^{(2)}$(0)$\\approx$1.2 when the injection current at the tapered section was\nincreased. We found good agreement with semi-classical laser theory near and\nbelow threshold while above laser threshold a slightly higher g$^{(2)}$(0) was\nobserved. As a free running device, the superluminescent diode yielded more\nthan 400 mW of optical output power with good spatial beam quality of\n$M^2_{slow} < 1.6$. In this case, the DSOC dropped only slightly from 1.9 at\nlow powers to 1.6 at the maximum output power. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst investigation of a high-power tapered superluminescent diode concerning\nthe degree of second-order coherence. Such a device might be useful for\nreal-world applications probing the second order coherence function, such as\nghost imaging.\n", "  In this chapter, criteria for existence of propagating optical modes which\nare transversely bound at the interface of two materials are studied. In\nparticular, quite general cases are considered, where the materials involved\nare assumed to be anisotropic, but also demonstrating magneto-electric effects.\nMoreover, surface states of two-dimensional materials like topological\ninsulators and graphene are also modeled via consideration of a conductivity\nsheet existing at the interface. A characteristic equation for obtaining the\npropagation constant of generalized interface modes is presented. Furthermore,\noptical modes sustained by a thin film of anisotropic materials with\nmagneto-electric effect and topological surface states are also investigated.\nIt is shown that interface modes supported by such a system are hybrid in\nnature, and can be further decomposed into the well-known classes of transverse\nmagnetic and electric modes, only at the absence of magneto-electric effect.\nAlthough the formulations driven here are mathematically abstract, they can be\nused to investigate polaritons in van der Waal materials, hyperbolic materials,\nand topological insulators.\n", "  We investigate topological phases induced by a driven electric field coupled\nto a dimer chain (a model for poly-acetylene) at high frequency regime. It is\nshown how the topological invariant of the system can be controlled by the\nfield amplitude. Furthermore, in the presence of a time-periodic electric\nfield, the effect of the next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes on\ntopological properties is studied. Breaking of the inversion symmetry causes to\nremove the degeneracy of zero edge states. The fractional Zak phase which is\nnow measurable by ultra-cold atoms in one dimensional optical lattice is also\ncalculated. For calculating modified band structure, we also develop a general\nFloquet-Bloch approach for systems under application of a potential with\nlattice and time translation invariance.\n", "  Experimental values of SdH and dHvA periods and cyclotron effective masses\nfound by Rosenman and Doi et al. have been compared with the theoretical\npredictions derived in this work for a tetragonal narrow gap semiconductor. By\nthe least square fit method the values of band parameters were obtained. It has\nbeen established that Cd$_3$As$_2$ has inverted band structure resembling HgTe\nunder tensile stress.\n", "  Antiferromagnetic Bi_{2}Fe_{4}O_{9} (BFO), lightly substituted by cobalt is\nstudied for magnetodielectricity. The substitution causes a substantial\ndecrease in the Neel temperature (T_N) from 250 K (in parent sample, BFO) to\n152 K (in 2% Co substituted sample). At the same time, the substituted samples\ndisplay a pronounced irreversibility in the ZFC-FC magnetization data for T $<$\n370 K and opening of hysteresis in the M-H plot, thus signifying the onset of\nweak ferromagnetism (FM) and magnetic glassiness. The induced magnetic\nglassiness is found to slow down the dynamics such that the magnetization decay\nfollows. The dielectric measurement in the same temperature window shows\nunusual oppression in, for T$\\sim$T_N and contrasting nature of tan loss for\ntemperatures above and below T_N, thus hinting a plausible coupling between the\nmagnetic and electric order parameters. A confirmation to this coupling is seen\nin the magnetodielectric (MD) results, in which it is found that the\nsubstitution induces an additional component in the MD, apart from the usual\ncomponents in BFO. This additional component of MD is found to obey behaviour,\nwith the n values being comparable to 1-p of magnetization. The temperature\nvariation of MD also shows a contrasting behaviour for the parent and 2% Co\nsubstituted sample with an enhancement of two times in MD value. In summary,\nour study shows ME coupling introduced by the magnetic glassiness and its\nbehaviour is very much different from the intrinsic one.\n", "  We first review our previous work arxiv:1503.02993 [math-ph] where we\nconsidered a model for topological recursion based on the Hopf Algebra of\nplanar binary trees of Loday and Ronco and showed that extending this Hopf\nAlgebra by identifying pairs of nearest neighbor leaves and thus producing\ngraphs with loops we obtain the full recursion formula of Eynard and Orantin.\nThen we discuss the algebraic structure of the spaces of correlation functions\nin g = 0 and in g > 0. By taking a classical and a quantum product respectively\nwe endow both spaces with a ring structure. This is an extended version of the\ncontributed talk given at the 2016 von Neumann Symposium on Topological\nRecursion and its Influence in Analysis, Geometry and Topology, from 4 to 8\nJuly 2016 at Hilton Charlotte University Place, USA.\n", "  We study the ground state of 1D Holstein single polaron with next nearest\nneighbour electron hopping (NNN), employing a variational approximation based\non exact diagonalization. Our investigation reveals that, depending upon the\nsign and magnitude of the NNN hopping integral with respect to nearest\nneighbour hopping, the polaron band minima may occur at non-zero kGS. We\ncompare the present scenario with the SSH polarons, where a similar feature is\nalso observed, albeit, due to very different mechanism. Our initial\ninvestigation of triplet bipolarons, in presence of an attractive extended\nHubbard interactions, further substantiates the differences between the present\nmodel and the SSH model.\n", "  In various areas of science, technology, environment protection,\nconstruction, it is very important to study processes of porous materials\ninteraction with different substances in different aggregation states. From the\npoint of view of ecology and environmental protection it is particularly actual\nto investigate processes of porous materials interaction with water in liquid\nand gaseous phases. Since one mole of water contains $6,022140857\\cdot 10^{23}$\nmolecules of $\\mathtt{H_2O}$, macroscopic approaches considering the water\nvapor as continuum media in the framework of classical aerodynamics are mainly\nused to describe properties, for example properties of water vapor in the pore.\nIn this paper we construct and use for simulation the macroscopic\ntwo-dimensional diffusion model describing the behavior of water vapor inside\nthe isolated pore. Together with the macroscopic model it is proposed\nmicroscopic model of the behavior of water vapor inside the isolated pores.\nThis microscopic model is built within the molecular dynamics approach. In the\nmicroscopic model a description of each water molecule motion is based on\nNewton classical mechanics considering interactions with other molecules and\npore walls. Time evolution of water vapor - pore system is explored. Depending\non the external to the pore conditions the system evolves to various states of\nequilibrium, characterized by different values of the macroscopic\ncharacteristics such as temperature, density, pressure. Comparisons of results\nof molecular dynamic simulations with the results of calculations based on the\nmacroscopic diffusion model and experimental data allow to conclude that the\ncombination of macroscopic and microscopic approach could produce more adequate\nand more accurate description of processes of water vapor interaction with\nporous materials.\n", "  This article is devoted to research the application of the spacecraft with a\nsolar sail to support the certain climatic conditions in an area of the Mars\nsurface. Authors propose principles of functioning of the spacecraft, intended\nto create a light and thermal light spot in a predetermined area of the Martian\nsurface. The mathematical motion model in such condition of the solar sail's\norientation is considered and used for motion simulation session. Moreover, the\nanalysis of this motion is performed. Thus, were obtained parameters of the\nstationary orbit of the spacecraft with a solar sail and were given\nrecommendations for further applying spacecrafts to reflect the sunlight on a\nplanet's surface.\n", "  Foamed emulsions are ubiquitous in our daily life but the ageing of such\nsystems is still poorly understood. In this study we investigate foam drainage\nand measure the evolution of the gas, liquid and oil volume fractions inside\nthe foam. We evidence three regimes of ageing. During an initial period of fast\ndrainage, both bubbles and drops are very mobile. As the foam stabilises\ndrainage proceeds leading to a gradual decrease of the liquid fraction and\nslowing down of drainage. Clusters of oil drops are less sheared, their dynamic\nviscosity increases and drainage slows down even further, until the drops\nbecome blocked. At this point the oil fraction starts to increase in the\ncontinuous phase. The foam ageing leads to an increase of the capillary\npressure until the oil acts as an antifoaming agent and the foam collapses.\n", "  Studies on Sun-climate connection have been carried out for several decades,\nand almost all of them focused on the effects of solar total irradiation\nenergy. As the second major terrestrial energy source from outer space, the\nsolar wind energy flux exhibits more significant long-term variations. However,\nits link to the global climate change is rarely concerned and remain a mystery.\nAs a fundamental and important aspect of the Earth's weather and climate\nsystem, tropical cyclone activity has been causing more and more attentions.\nHere we investigate the possible modulation of the total energy flux input from\nthe solar wind into the Earth's magnetosphere on the global tropical cyclone\nactivity during 1963--2012. From a global perspective, the accumulated cyclone\nenergy increases gradually since 1963 and start to decrease after 1994. Compare\nto the previously frequently used parameters, e,g., the sunspot number, the\ntotal solar irradiation, the solar F10.7 irradiation, the tropical sea surface\ntemperature, and the south oscillation index, the total solar wind energy flux\ninput exhibits a better correlation with the global tropical cyclone activity.\nFurthermore, the tropical cyclones seem to be more intense with higher\ngeomagnetic activities. A plausible modulation mechanism is thus proposed to\nlink the terrestrial weather phenomenon to the seemly-unrelated solar wind\nenergy input.\n", "  Significant improvements to the production rate of additive manufacturing\n(AM) technologies are essential to their cost-effectiveness and competitiveness\nwith traditional processing routes. Moreover, much faster AM processes, in\ncombination with the geometric versatility of AM, will enable entirely new\nworkflows for product design and customization. We present the design and\nvalidation of a desktop-scale extrusion AM system that achieves far greater\nbuild rate than benchmarked commercial systems. This system, which we call\nFastFFF, is motivated by our recent analysis of the rate-limiting mechanisms to\nconventional fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology. The FastFFF system\nmutually overcomes these limits, using a nut-feed extruder, laser-heated\npolymer liquefier, and servo-driven parallel gantry system to achieve high\nextrusion force, rapid filament heating, and fast gantry motion, respectively.\nThe extrusion and heating mechanisms are contained in a compact printhead that\nreceives a threaded filament and augments conduction heat transfer with a\nfiber-coupled diode laser. The prototype system achieves a volumetric build\nrate of 127 cm3/hr, which is 7-fold greater than commercial desktop FFF\nsystems, at comparable resolution; the maximum extrusion rate of the printhead\nis ~14-fold greater (282 cm3/hr). The performance limits of the printhead and\nmotion systems are characterized, and the tradeoffs between build rate and\nresolution are assessed and discussed. The combination of high-speed motion and\nhigh deposition rate achieved by the FastFFF technology also poses challenges\nand opportunities for toolpath optimization and real-time deposition control.\nHigh-speed desktop printing raises the possibility of new use cases and\nbusiness models for AM, where handheld parts are built in minutes rather than\nhours.\n", "  We propose a novel numerical approach for the optimal design of wide-area\nheterogeneous electromagnetic metasurfaces beyond the conventionally used\nunit-cell approximation. The proposed method exploits the combination of\nRigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) and global optimization techniques (two\nevolutionary algorithms namely the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a modified form\nof the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC with memetic search phase method) are\nconsidered). As a specific example, we consider the design of beam deflectors\nusing all-dielectric nanoantennae for operation in the visible wavelength\nregion; beam deflectors can serve as building blocks for other more complicated\ndevices like metalenses. Compared to previous reports using local optimization\napproaches our approach improves device efficiency; transmission efficiency is\nespecially improved for wide deflection angle beam deflectors. The ABC method\nwith memetic search phase is also an improvement over the more commonly used GA\nas it reaches similar efficiency levels with upto 35% reduction in computation\ntime. The method described here is of interest for the rapid design of a wide\nvariety of electromagnetic metasurfaces irrespective of their operational\nwavelength.\n", "  This paper experimentally demonstrates that the AC impedance spectrum of the\nLED as a photodetector heavily depends on the received optical power, which may\ncause the impedance mismatch between the LED and the post trans-impedance\namplifier. The optical power dependent impedance of the LED is well fitted by a\nmodified dispersive carrier transport model for inorganic semiconductors. The\nbandwidth of the LED-LED visible light communication link is further shown to\ndecrease with the optical power received by the LED. This leads to a trade-off\nbetween link bandwidth and SNR, and consequently affects the choice of the\nproper dada modulation scheme.\n", "  In this paper the performance and financial analysis of a grid-connected\nphotovoltaic system installed at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) is\nevaluated. The power plant has the capacity of 14.8 kW and has been under\noperation since August 2014. This solar PV system is composed of two 7.4 kW\nsub-arrays, one fixed and one with single axis tracking. First, an overview of\nthe system followed by local weather characteristics in Boca Raton, Florida is\npresented. In addition, monthly averaged daily solar radiation in Boca Raton as\nwell as system AC are calculated utilizing the PVwatts simulation calculator.\nInputs such as module and inverter specifications are applied to the System\nAdvisor Model (SAM) to design and optimize the system. Finally, the estimated\nlocal load demand as well as simulation results are extracted and analyzed.\n", "  Over the past decade, capacitive deionization (CDI) has realized a surge in\nattention in the field of water desalination and can now be considered as an\nimportant technology class, along with reverse osmosis and electrodialysis.\nWhile many of the recently developed technologies no longer use a mechanism\nthat follows the strict definition of the term \"capacitive\", these methods\nnevertheless share many common elements that encourage treating them with\nsimilar metrics and analyses. Specifically, they all involve electrically\ndriven removal of ions from a feed stream, storage in an electrode (i.e., ion\nelectrosorption) and release, in charge/discharge cycles. Grouping all these\nmethods in the technology class of CDI makes it possible to treat evolving new\ntechnologies in standardized terms and compare them to other technologies in\nthe same class.\n", "  In this paper, we compare the structural features of Ca modified Ba(Ti, Sn)O3\nwith that of its Ca-free counterpart to understand why the Ca-modified variant\nof this lead-free piezoelectric gives a much higher piezoelectric response. We\nfound that in spite of the reduced spontaneous lattice strain, the polarization\nof the Ca-modified variant is higher. We, therefore, demonstrate that the very\nlarge piezoelectric response of (Ba, Ca)(Ti, Sn)O3 is associated with the\ndecoupling of the polarization and lattice strain by Ca-modification.\n", "  Energy transport equations are derived directly from full molecular dynamics\nmodels as coarse-grained description. With the local energy chosen as the\ncoarse-grained variables, we apply the Mori-Zwanzig formalism to derive a\nreduced model, in the form of a generalized Langevin equation. A Markovian\nembedding technique is then introduced to eliminate the history dependence. In\nsharp contrast to conventional energy transport models, this derivation yields\n{\\it stochastic} dynamics models for the spatially averaged energy. We discuss\nthe approximation of the random force using both additive and multiplicative\nnoises, to ensure the correct statistics of the solution.\n", "  Deep learning has become a promising approach for automated medical\ndiagnoses. When medical data samples are limited, collaboration among multiple\ninstitutions is necessary to achieve high algorithm performance. However,\nsharing patient data often has limitations due to technical, legal, or ethical\nconcerns. In such cases, sharing a deep learning model is a more attractive\nalternative. The best method of performing such a task is unclear, however. In\nthis study, we simulate the dissemination of learning deep learning network\nmodels across four institutions using various heuristics and compare the\nresults with a deep learning model trained on centrally hosted patient data.\nThe heuristics investigated include ensembling single institution models,\nsingle weight transfer, and cyclical weight transfer. We evaluated these\napproaches for image classification in three independent image collections\n(retinal fundus photos, mammography, and ImageNet). We find that cyclical\nweight transfer resulted in a performance (testing accuracy = 77.3%) that was\nclosest to that of centrally hosted patient data (testing accuracy = 78.7%). We\nalso found that there is an improvement in the performance of cyclical weight\ntransfer heuristic with high frequency of weight transfer.\n", "  The magnetization as a function of magnetic field showed hysteretic behavior\nat room temperature. According to the temperature dependence of the\nmagnetization, the Curie temperature $(T_{C})$ is higher than 350 K.\nFerromagnetic Mn-doped tin oxide thin films exhibited low electrical\nresistivity and high optical transmittance in the visible region (400-800 nm).\nThe coexistence of ferromagnetism, high visible transparency and high\nelectrical conductivity in the Mn-doped $SnO_{2}$ films is expected to be a\ndesirable trait for spintronics devices.\n", "  The aim of this essay is to analyze the role of quantum mechanics as an\ninherent characteristic of life. During the last ten years the problem of the\norigin of life has become an innovative research subject approached by many\nauthors. The essay is divided in to three parts: the first deals with the\nproblem of life from a philosophical and biological perspective. The second\npresents the conceptual and methodological basis of the essay which is founded\non the Information Theory and the Quantum Theory. This basis is then used, in\nthe third part, to discuss the different arguments and conjectures of a quantum\norigin of life. There are many philosophical views on the problem of life, two\nof which are especially important at the moment: reductive physicalism and\nbiosystemic emergentism. From a scientific perspective, all the theories and\nexperimental evidences put forward by Biology can be summed up in to two main\nresearch themes: the RNA world and the vesicular theory. The RNA world, from a\nphysicalist point of view, maintains that replication is the essence of life\nwhile the vesicular theory, founded on biosystemic grounds, believes the\nessence of life can be found in cellular metabolism. This essay uses the\nInformation Theory to discard the idea of a spontaneous emergency of life\nthrough replication. Understanding the nature and basis of quantum mechanics is\nfundamental in order to be able to comprehend the advantages of using quantum\ncomputation to be able increase the probabilities of existence of auto\nreplicative structures. Different arguments are set forth such as the inherence\nof quantum mechanics to the origin of life. Finally, in order to try to resolve\nthe question of auto replication, three scientific propositions are put\nforward: Q-life, the quantum combinatory library and the role of algorithms in\nthe origin of genetic language.\n", "  Moving self-localized vibration of large size (vibrational soliton) in\nmonatomic chain with cubic and quartic anharmonicities is considered. Two types\nof motion of such vibrations are found: the subsonic and the supersonic ones.\nFirst type of motion is possible for chains with hard quartic anharmonicity\nsupposing that cubic anharmonicity is weak. This motion was earlier observed in\nnumerical simulations. For the second type of motion the cubic anharmonicity\nplays the decisive role: the moving mode is stabilized by co-moving deformation\nof the lattice caused by this anharmonicity. The quartic anharmonicity in this\ncase may be absent or even soft.\n", "  Weyl points, serving as monopoles in the momentum space and laying the\nfoundation of topological gapless phases, have recently been experimentally\ndemonstrated in various physical systems. However, none of the observed Weyl\ndegeneracies are ideal: they either offset in energy or coexist with trivial\ndispersions at other momenta. The lack of an ideal Weyl system sets a serious\nlimit to the further development of Weyl physics and potential applications.\nHere, by constructing a photonic metamaterial, we experimentally observe an\nideal Weyl system, whose nodal frequencies are pinned by symmetries to exactly\nthe same value. Benefitting from the ideal Weyl nodes, we are able to map out\nthe complete evolution of the helicoid surface states spinning around the\nprojections of each Weyl nodes. Our discovery provides an ideal photonic\nplatform for Weyl systems and novel topological devices.\n", "  Matched-filter searches for gravitational waves from coalescing compact\nbinaries by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration use the FINDCHIRP algorithm: an\nimplementation of the optimal filter with innovations to account for unknown\nsignal parameters and to improve performance on detector data that has\nnonstationary and non-Gaussian artifacts. We provide details on the FINDCHIRP\nalgorithm as used in the search for subsolar mass binaries, binary neutron\nstars, neutron star-black hole binaries, and binary black holes.\n"]}
