We devise methods to study their superposition rules, time independent\nconstants of motion and Lie symmetries, linearisability conditions, etc. Our\nresults are illustrated by examples of physical and mathematical interest.\n", "  An integrable model possessing inhomogeneous ground states is proposed as an\neffective model of non-uniform quantum condensates such as supersolids and\nFulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov superfluids. The model is a higher-order\nanalog of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. We derive an $n$-soliton\nsolution via the inverse scattering theory with elliptic-functional background,\nand reveal various kinds of soliton dynamics such as dark soliton billiards,\ndislocations, gray solitons, and envelope solitons. We also provide the exact\nbosonic and fermionic quasiparticle eigenstates and clarify their tunneling\nphenomena. The solutions are expressed by a determinant of theta functions.\n", "  We investigate non-radial oscillations of hadronic, hybrid and pure\nself-bound strange quark stars with maximum masses above the mass of the\nrecently observed massive pulsars PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348-0432 with $M\n\\approx 2 M_{\\odot}$. For the hadronic equation of state we employ different\nparametrizations of a relativistic mean-field model and for quark matter we use\nthe MIT bag model including the effect of strong interactions and color\nsuperconductivity. We find that the first pressure mode for strange quark stars\nhas a very different shape than for hadronic and hybrid stars. For strange\nquarks stars the frequency of the p1 mode is larger than 6 kHz and diverge at\nsmall stellar masses, but for hadronic and hybrid stars it is in the range 4-6\nkHz. This allows an observational identification of strange stars even if extra\ninformation such as the mass, the radius or the gravitational redshift of the\nobject is unavailable or uncertain. Also, we find as in previous works that the\nfrequency of the g-mode associated with the quark-hadron discontinuity in a\nhybrid star is in the range 0.4-1 kHz for all masses. Thus, compact objects\nemitting gravitational waves above 6 kHz should be interpreted as strange quark\nstars and those emitting a signal within 0.4-1 kHz should be interpreted as\nhybrid stars.\n", "  It is analytically shown that symmetry breaking, in dissipative systems,\naffects the nature of the bifurcation at onset of instability resulting in\ntransitions from super to subcritical bifurcations. In the case of a nonlinear\nfiber cavity, we have derived an amplitude equation to describe the nonlinear\ndynamics above threshold. An analytical expression of the critical transition\ncurve is obtained and the predictions are in excellent agreement with the\nnumerical solutions of the full dynamical model.\n", "  The Wiener Sausage, the volume traced out by a sphere attached to a Brownian\nparticle, is a classical problem in statistics and mathematical physics.\nInitially motivated by a range of field-theoretic, technical questions, we\npresent a single loop renormalised perturbation theory of a stochastic process\nclosely related to the Wiener Sausage, which, however, proves to be exact for\nthe exponents and some amplitudes. The field-theoretic approach is particularly\nelegant and very enjoyable to see at work on such a classic problem. While we\nrecover a number of known, classical results, the field-theoretic techniques\ndeployed provide a particularly versatile framework, which allows easy\ncalculation with different boundary conditions even of higher momenta and more\ncomplicated correlation functions. At the same time, we provide a highly\ninstructive, non-trivial example for some of the technical particularities of\nthe field-theoretic description of stochastic processes, such as excluded\nvolume, lack of translational invariance and immobile particles. The aim of the\npresent work is not to improve upon the well-established results for the Wiener\nSausage, but to provide a field-theoretic approach to it, in order to gain a\nbetter understanding of the field-theoretic obstacles to overcome.\n", "  The Chirikov standard map and the 2D Froeschl\\'e map are investigated. A few\nthousand values of the Hurst exponent (HE) and the maximal Lyapunov exponent\n(mLE) are plotted in a mixed space of the nonlinear parameter versus the\ninitial condition. Both characteristic exponents reveal remarkably similar\nstructures in this space. A tight correlation between the HEs and mLEs is\nfound, with the Spearman rank $\\rho=0.83$ and $\\rho=0.75$ for the Chirikov and\n2D Froeschl\\'e maps, respectively. Based on this relation, a machine learning\n(ML) procedure, using the nearest neighbor algorithm, is performed to reproduce\nthe HE distribution based on the mLE distribution alone. A few thousand HE and\nmLE values from the mixed spaces were used for training, and then using\n$2-2.4\\times 10^5$ mLEs, the HEs were retrieved. The ML procedure allowed to\nreproduce the structure of the mixed spaces in great detail.\n", "  We study a novel electromagnetic signature of supermassive black hole\nbinaries whose inspiral starts being dominated by gravitational wave (GW)\nemission. Recent simulations suggest that the binary's member BHs can continue\nto accrete gas from the circumbinary accretion disk in this phase of the\nbinary's evolution, all the way until coalescence. If one of the binary members\nproduces a radio jet as a result of accretion, the jet precesses along a\nbiconical surface due to the binary's orbital motion. When the binary enters\nthe GW phase of its evolution, the opening angle widens, the jet exhibits\nmilliarcsecond scale wiggles, and the conical surface of jet precession is\ntwisted due to apparant superluminal motion. The rapidly increasing orbital\nvelocity of the binary gives the jet an appearance of a \"chirp.\" This helical\nchirping morphology of the jet can be used to infer the binary parameters. For\nbinaries with mass 10^7--10^10 Msun at redshifts z<0.5, monitoring these\nfeatures in current and archival data will place a lower limit on sources that\ncould be detected by eLISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays. In the future,\nmicroarcsecond interferometry with the Square Kilometer Array will increase the\npotential usefulness of this technique.\n", "  It is a fundamental problem to decide how many copies of an unknown mixed\nquantum state are necessary and sufficient to determine the state. Previously,\nit was known only that estimating states to error $\\epsilon$ in trace distance\nrequired $O(dr^2/\\epsilon^2)$ copies for a $d$-dimensional density matrix of\nrank $r$. Here, we give a theoretical measurement scheme (POVM) that requires\n$O (dr/ \\delta ) \\ln (d/\\delta) $ copies of $\\rho$ to error $\\delta$ in\ninfidelity, and a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors. This implies\n$O( (dr / \\epsilon^2) \\ln (d/\\epsilon) )$ copies suffice to achieve error\n$\\epsilon$ in trace distance. We also prove that for independent (product)\nmeasurements, $\\Omega(dr^2/\\delta^2) / \\ln(1/\\delta)$ copies are necessary in\norder to achieve error $\\delta$ in infidelity. For fixed $d$, our measurement\ncan be implemented on a quantum computer in time polynomial in $n$.\n", "  We review some recent results about the mechanism of deconfinement of\nhadronic matter into quark matter in cold neutron stars and protoneutron stars.\nWe discuss the role of finite size effects and the relevance of temperature and\ndensity fluctuations on the nucleation process. We also examine the importance\nof surface effects for mixed phases in hybrid stars. A small drop of quark\nmatter nucleated at the core of a compact star may grow if the conversion is\nsufficiently exothermic. In such a case, it may trigger the burning of the\nstellar core and even the whole star if quark matter is absolutely stable. We\nexplore the physical processes that occur inside the flame and analyze the\nhydrodynamic evolution of the combustion front. In the last part of this\nreview, we focus on hybrid stars using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with\nscalar, vector and 't Hooft interactions, paying particular attention to a\ngeneralized non-standard procedure for the choice of the 'bag constant'. We\nalso describe the non-radial oscillation modes of hadronic, hybrid and strange\nstars with maximum masses above $2 M_{\\odot}$ and show that the frequency of\nthe $p_1$ and $g$ fluid modes contains key information about the internal\ncomposition of compact objects.\n", "  Aspects of the theory of characteristic modes, based on their variational\nformulation, are presented and an explicit form of a related functional,\ninvolving only currents in a spatial domain, is derived. The new formulation\nleads to deeper insight into the modal behavior of radiating structures as\ndemonstrated by a detailed analysis of three canonical structures: a dipole, an\narray of two dipoles and a loop, cylinder and a sphere. It is demonstrated that\nknowledge of the analytical functional can be utilized to solve important\nproblems related to the theory of characteristic modes decomposition such as\nthe resonance of inductive modes or the benchmarking of method of moments code.\n", "  Recent experimental work has demonstrated optical control of spin wave\nemission by tuning the shape of the optical pulse (Satoh et al.\\ Nature\nPhotonics, 6, 662 (2012)). We reproduce these results and extend the scope of\nthe control by investigating nonlinear effects for large amplitude excitations.\nWe observe an accumulation of spin wave power at the center of the initial\nexcitation combined with short-wavelength spin waves. These kind of nonlinear\neffects have not been observed in earlier work on nonlinearities of spin waves.\nOur observations pave the way for the manipulation of magnetic structures at a\nsmaller scale than the beam focus, for instance in devices with all-optical\ncontrol of magnetism.\n", "  We investigate how the quantum dynamics of gravitational models depends on\nthe internal clock employed in quantisation. Our previous result on the quantum\nFriedmann-Lemaitre model demonstrates that almost all physical predictions from\nthe quantum cosmological dynamics, e.g. the scale of the quantum bounce or the\nnumber of bounces, depend on the choice of internal clock. In the present paper\nwe show that there exists an important prediction concerning the quantum\ndynamics which holds in all internal clocks. Namely, we prove that any quantum\nstate asymptotically, i.e. away from a quantum interaction regime, admits a\nunique classical limit described by unique classical solutions irrespectively\nof the internal clock used for dynamical description of the given state. We\ndemonstrate this property explicitly for the semiclassical Bianchi Type I\nmodel, which includes the semiclassical Friedmann-Lemaitre model as a special\ncase. Our methods include the theory of pseudo-canonical transformations and\nthe phase space portraits based on coherent states. As a by-product of the\npursuit of our main goal, we elaborate the semiclassical description of\nanisotropic singularity resolution.\n", "  Fourier solvers have become efficient tools to establish structure-property\nrelations in heterogeneous materials. Introduced as an alternative to the\nFinite Element (FE) method, they are based on fixed-point solutions of the\nLippmann-Schwinger type integral equation. Their computational efficiency\nresults from handling the kernel of this equation by the Fast Fourier Transform\n(FFT). However, the kernel is derived from an auxiliary homogeneous linear\nproblem, which renders the extension of FFT-based schemes to non-linear\nproblems conceptually difficult. This paper aims to establish a link between\nFE- and FFT-based methods, in order to develop a solver applicable to general\nhistory- and time-dependent material models. For this purpose, we follow the\nstandard steps of the FE method, starting from the weak form, proceeding to the\nGalerkin discretization and the numerical quadrature, up to the solution of\nnon-linear equilibrium equations by an iterative Newton-Krylov solver. No\nauxiliary linear problem is thus needed. By analyzing a two-phase laminate with\nnon-linear elastic, elasto-plastic, and visco-plastic phases, and by\nelasto-plastic simulations of a dual-phase steel microstructure, we demonstrate\nthat the solver exhibits robust convergence. These results are achieved by\nre-using the non-linear FE technology, with the potential of further extensions\nbeyond small-strain inelasticity considered in this paper.\n", "  This work describes a powerful, yet simple, procedure how to acquire a\ncurrent approaching the lower bound of quality factor Q. This optimal current\ncan be determined for an arbitrarily shaped electrically small radiator made of\na perfect conductor. Quality factor Q is evaluated by Vandenbosch's relations\nyielding stored electromagnetic energy as a function of the source current\ndensity. All calculations are based on a matrix representation of the\nintegro-differential operators. This approach simplifies the entire development\nand results in a straightforward numerical evaluation. The optimal current is\nrepresented in a basis of modal currents suitable for solving the optimization\nproblem so that the minimum is approached by either one mode tuned to the\nresonance, or, by two properly combined modes. An overview of which modes\nshould be selected and how they should be combined is provided and results\nconcerning rectangular plate, spherical shell and fractal shapes of varying\ngeometrical complexity are presented. The reduction of quality factor Q and the\nG/Q ratio are studied and, thanks to the modal decomposition, the physical\ninterpretation of the results is discussed in conjunction with the limitations\nof the proposed procedure.\n", "  An optimization problem has been formulated to find a resonant current\nextremizing various antenna parameters. The method is presented on, but not\nlimited to, particular cases of gain $G$, quality factor $Q$, gain to quality\nfactor ratio $G/Q$, and radiation efficiency $\\eta$ of canonical shapes with\nconduction losses explicitly included. The Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis\nrepresentation is used to simplify the underlying algebra while still allowing\nsurface current regions of arbitrary shape to be treated. By switching to\nanother basis generated by a specific eigenvalue problem, it is finally shown\nthat the optimal current can, in principle, be found as a combination of a few\neigenmodes. The presented method constitutes a general framework in which the\nantenna parameters, expressed as bilinear forms, can automatically be\nextremized.\n", "  We construct a relativistic metric description of MOND using the Palatini\nformalism following the \\( f(\\chi)=\\chi^b \\) description of\n\\citet{mendozatula}. We show that in order to recover the non-relativistic MOND\nregime where, for circular orbits the Tully-Fisher law replaces Kepler's third\nlaw, the value of the parameter $ b = 3/2 $, which is coincident with the value\nfound using a pure metric formalism Capozziello et al. (2011). Unlike the pure\nmetric formalism, which yields 4th order field equations, the Palatini approach\nyields second order field equations, which is a desirable requirement from a\ntheoretical perspective. Thus, the phenomenology associated to astrophysical\nphenomena with Tully-Fisher scalings can be accounted for using this proposal,\nwithout the need to introduce any non-baryonic dark matter particles.\n", "  Tailoring the interactions between quantum emitters and single photons\nconstitutes one of the cornerstones of quantum optics. Coupling a quantum\nemitter to the band edge of a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW) provides a\nunique platform for tuning these interactions. In particular, the crossover\nfrom propagating fields $E(x) \\propto e^{\\pm ik_x x}$ outside the bandgap to\nlocalized fields $E(x) \\propto e^{-\\kappa_x |x|}$ within the bandgap should be\naccompanied by a transition from largely dissipative atom-atom interactions to\na regime where dispersive atom-atom interactions are dominant. Here, we\nexperimentally observe this transition for the first time by shifting the band\nedge frequency of the PCW relative to the $\\rm D_1$ line of atomic cesium for\n$\\bar{N}=3.0\\pm 0.5$ atoms trapped along the PCW. Our results are the initial\ndemonstration of this new paradigm for coherent atom-atom interactions with low\ndissipation into the guided mode.\n", "  Tunneling in quantum field theory is worth understanding properly, not least\nbecause it controls the long term fate of our universe. There are however, a\nnumber of features of tunneling rate calculations which lack a desirable\ntransparency, such as the necessity of analytic continuation, the\nappropriateness of using an effective instead of classical potential, and the\nsensitivity to short-distance physics. This paper attempts to review in\npedagogical detail the physical origin of tunneling and its connection to the\npath integral. Both the traditional potential-deformation method and a recent\nmore direct propagator-based method are discussed. Some new insights from using\napproximate semi-classical solutions are presented. In addition, we explore the\nsensitivity of the lifetime of our universe to short distance physics, such as\nquantum gravity, emphasizing a number of important subtleties.\n", "  Homophily, the tendency of individuals to associate with others who share\nsimilar traits, has been identified as a major driving force in the formation\nand evolution of social ties. In many cases, it is not clear if homophily is\nthe result of a socialization process, where individuals change their traits\naccording to the dominance of that trait in their local social networks, or if\nit results from a selection process, in which individuals reshape their social\nnetworks so that their traits match those in the new environment. Here we\ndemonstrate the detailed temporal formation of strong homophily in academic\nachievements of high school and university students. We analyze a unique\ndataset that contains information about the detailed time evolution of a\nfriendship network of 6,000 students across 42 months. Combining the evolving\nsocial network data with the time series of the academic performance (GPA) of\nindividual students, we show that academic homophily is a result of selection:\nstudents prefer to gradually reorganize their social networks according to\ntheir performance levels, rather than adapting their performance to the level\nof their local group. We find no signs for a pull effect, where a social\nenvironment of good performers motivates bad students to improve their\nperformance. We are able to understand the underlying dynamics of grades and\nnetworks with a simple model. The lack of a social pull effect in classical\neducational settings could have important implications for the understanding of\nthe observed persistence of segregation, inequality and social immobility in\nsocieties.\n", "  We propose a modelling framework to analyse the stochastic behaviour of\nheterogeneous, multi-scale cellular populations. We illustrate our methodology\nwith a particular example in which we study a population with an\noxygen-regulated proliferation rate. Our formulation is based on an\nage-dependent stochastic process. Cells within the population are characterised\nby their age. The age-dependent (oxygen-regulated) birth rate is given by a\nstochastic model of oxygen-dependent cell cycle progression. We then formulate\nan age-dependent birth-and-death process, which dictates the time evolution of\nthe cell population. The population is under a feedback loop which controls its\nsteady state size: cells consume oxygen which in turns fuels cell\nproliferation. We show that our stochastic model of cell cycle progression\nallows for heterogeneity within the cell population induced by stochastic\neffects. Such heterogeneous behaviour is reflected in variations in the\nproliferation rate. Within this set-up, we have established three main results.\nFirst, we have shown that the age to the G1/S transition, which essentially\ndetermines the birth rate, exhibits a remarkably simple scaling behaviour. This\nallows for a huge simplification of our numerical methodology. A further result\nis the observation that heterogeneous populations undergo an internal process\nof quasi-neutral competition. Finally, we investigated the effects of\ncell-cycle-phase dependent therapies (such as radiation therapy) on\nheterogeneous populations. In particular, we have studied the case in which the\npopulation contains a quiescent sub-population. Our mean-field analysis and\nnumerical simulations confirm that, if the survival fraction of the therapy is\ntoo high, rescue of the quiescent population occurs. This gives rise to\nemergence of resistance to therapy since the rescued population is less\nsensitive to therapy.\n", "  We study dynamical aspects of the $q$-state Potts model on an $n\\times n$ box\nat its critical $\\beta_c(q)$. Heat-bath Glauber dynamics and cluster dynamics\nsuch as Swendsen--Wang (that circumvent low-temperature bottlenecks) are all\nexpected to undergo \"critical slowdowns\" in the presence of periodic boundary\nconditions: the inverse spectral gap, which in the subcritical regime is\n$O(1)$, should at criticality be polynomial in $n$ for $1< q \\leq 4$, and\nexponential in $n$ for $q>4$ in accordance with the predicted discontinuous\nphase transition. This was confirmed for $q=2$ (the Ising model) by the second\nauthor and Sly, and for sufficiently large $q$ by Borgs et al.\n  Here we show that the following holds for the critical Potts model on the\ntorus: for $q=3$, the inverse gap of Glauber dynamics is $n^{O(1)}$; for $q=4$,\nit is at most $n^{O(\\log n)}$; and for every $q>4$ in the phase-coexistence\nregime, the inverse gaps of both Glauber dynamics and Swendsen--Wang dynamics\nare exponential in $n$.\n  For free or monochromatic boundary conditions and large $q$, we show that the\ndynamics at criticality is faster than on the torus (unlike the Ising model\nwhere free/periodic boundary conditions induce similar dynamical behavior at\nall temperatures): the inverse gap of Swendsen--Wang dynamics is\n$\\exp(n^{o(1)})$.\n", "  We develop an extended pump-probe Faraday rotation technique to study the\nsubmicrosecond electron spin dynamics with picosecond time resolution in a wide\nrange of magnetic fields. The electron spin dephasing time $T_2^*$ and the\nlongitudinal spin relaxation time $T_1$, both approaching $250$ ns in weak\nfields, are measured thereby in $n$-type bulk GaAs. By tailoring the pump pulse\ntrain through increasing the contained number of pulses, the buildup of\nresonant spin amplification is demonstrated for the electron spin polarization.\nThe spin precession amplitude in high magnetic fields applied in the Voigt\ngeometry shows a non-monotonic dynamics deviating strongly from a\nmono-exponential decay and revealing slow beatings. The beatings indicate a two\nspin component behavior with a $g$-factor difference of $\\Delta g \\sim\n4\\times10^{-4}$, much smaller than the $\\Delta g$ expected for free and\ndonor-bound electrons. This $g$-factor variation indicates efficient, but\nincomplete spin exchange averaging.\n", "  In this paper, we develop an analytical formulation for the Slepian\nspatial-spectral concentration problem on the sphere for a limited\ncolatitude-longitude spatial region on the sphere, defined as the Cartesian\nproduct of a range of positive colatitudes and longitudes. The solution of the\nSlepian problem is a set of functions that are optimally concentrated and\northogonal within a spatial or spectral region. These properties make them\nuseful for applications where measurements are taken within a spatially limited\nregion of the sphere and/or a signal is only to be analyzed within a region of\nthe sphere. To support localized spectral/spatial analysis, and estimation and\nsparse representation of localized data in these applications, we exploit the\nexpansion of spherical harmonics in the complex exponential basis to develop an\nanalytical formulation for the Slepian concentration problem for a limited\ncolatitude-longitude spatial region. We also extend the analytical formulation\nfor spatial regions that are comprised of a union of rotated limited\ncolatitude-longitude subregions. By exploiting various symmetries of the\nproposed formulation, we design a computationally efficient algorithm for the\nimplementation of the proposed analytical formulation. Such a reduction in\ncomputation time is demonstrated through numerical experiments. We present\nillustrations of our results with the help of numerical examples and show that\nthe representation of a spatially concentrated signal is indeed sparse in the\nSlepian basis.\n", "  So far, many network-structure-based link prediction methods have been\nproposed. However, these methods only highlight one or two structural features\nof networks, and then use the methods to predict missing links in different\nnetworks. The performances of these existing methods are not always satisfied\nin all cases since each network has its unique underlying structural features.\nIn this paper, by analyzing different real networks, we find that the\nstructural features of different networks are remarkably different. In\nparticular, even in the same network, their inner structural features are\nutterly different. Therefore, more structural features should be considered.\nHowever, owing to the remarkably different structural features, the\ncontributions of different features are hard to be given in advance. Inspired\nby these facts, an \\emph{adaptive} fusion model regarding link prediction is\nproposed to incorporate multiple structural features. In the model, a logistic\nfunction combing multiple structural features is defined, then the weight of\neach feature in the logistic function is \\emph{adaptively} determined by\nexploiting the known structure information. Last, we use the \"learnt\" logistic\nfunction to predict the connection probabilities of missing links. According to\nour experimental results, we find that the performance of our adaptive fusion\nmodel is better than many similarity indices.\n", "  We report an unusual magnetic ground state in single-crystal,\ndouble-perovskite Ba2YIrO6 and Sr doped Ba2YIrO6 with Ir5+(5d4) ions.\nLong-range magnetic order below 1.7 K is confirmed by DC magnetization, AC\nmagnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements. The observed magnetic\norder is extraordinarily delicate and cannot be explained in terms of either a\nlow-spin S=1 state, or a singlet Jeff=0 state imposed by the spin-orbit\ninteractions (SOI). Alternatively, the magnetic ground state appears consistent\nwith a SOI that competes with comparable Hund's rule coupling and inherently\nlarge electron hopping, which cannot stabilize the singlet Jeff=0 ground state.\nHowever, this picture is controversial, and conflicting magnetic behavior for\nthese materials is reported in both experimental and theoretical studies, which\nhighlights the intricate interplay of interactions that determine the ground\nstate of materials with strong SOI.\n", "  We construct a quantum-inspired classical algorithm for computing the\npermanent of Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices, by exploiting a\nconnection between these mathematical structures and the boson sampling model.\nSpecifically, the permanent of a Hermitian positive semidefinite matrix can be\nexpressed in terms of the expected value of a random variable, which stands for\na specific photon-counting probability when measuring a linear-optically\nevolved random multimode coherent state. Our algorithm then approximates the\nmatrix permanent from the corresponding sample mean and is shown to run in\npolynomial time for various sets of Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices,\nachieving a precision that improves over known techniques. This work\nillustrates how quantum optics may benefit algorithms development.\n", "  We outline the general construction of three-players games with incomplete\ninformation which fulfil the following conditions: (i) symmetry with respect to\nthe exchange of the players; (ii) the existence of the upper bound for total\npayoff resulting from Bell inequalities; (iii) the existence of both fair and\nunfair Nash equilibria saturating this bound. Conditions (i)$\\div$(iii) imply\nthat we are dealing with conflicting interest games. An explicit example of\nsuch a game is given. A quantum counterpart of this game is considered which is\nobtained by keeping the same utilities but replacing classical advisor by a\nquantum one. It is shown that the quantum game possesses only fair equilibria\nwith strictly higher payoffs than in the classical case. This implies that\nquantum nonlocality can be used to resolve a conflict between players.\n", "  In high Tc superconductors the magnetic and electronic properties are\ndetermined by the probability that valence electrons virtually jump from site\nto site in the CuO2 planes, a mechanism opposed by on-site Coulomb repulsion\nand favored by hopping integrals. The spatial extent of the latter is related\nto transport properties, including superconductivity, and to the dispersion\nrelation of spin excitations (magnons). Here, for three antiferromagnetic\nparent compounds (single-layer Bi2Sr0.99La1.1CuO6+delta, double-layer\nNd1.2Ba1.8Cu3O6 and infinite-layer CaCuO2) differing by the number of apical\natoms, we compare the magnetic spectra measured by resonant inelastic x-ray\nscattering over a significant portion of the reciprocal space and with\nunprecedented accuracy. We observe that the absence of apical oxygens increases\nthe in-plane hopping range and, in CaCuO2, it leads to a genuine 3D\nexchange-bond network. These results establish a corresponding relation between\nthe exchange interactions and the crystal structure, and provide fresh insight\ninto the materials dependence of the superconducting transition temperature.\n", "  Intrinsic Localized Modes (ILMs) or Discrete Breathers (DBs) are produced\nthrough a non-linear vibration localization phenomenon. While Anderson\nlocalization is due to lattice defects, the nonlinearity of lattices provides\nthe basis for ILM excitation. Over the past two decades, these ILMs have been\nrealized in a wide range of physical systems including photonic crystals,\nnonlinear atomic lattices, anti-ferromagnets, coupled Josephson junction arrays\nand coupled cantilevers. This paper brings out the feasibility of exciting ILMs\nin a standalone mechanical resonator. Through piezoelectric driving and optical\nvisualization, various intriguing features of ILMs have been recorded. The ILMs\nin our system are observed as spectral bushes and their frequencies are much\nlower than that of the drive frequency. The excitation of ILMs is mediated\nthrough large amplitude instability following autoparametric excitation of a\nsub-harmonic mode. The spatial prevalence of discrete ILM excitations is at\nantinodes of the sub-harmonic mode. Further, the ILMs have been observed to be\ntime-variant and various events including attraction-repulsion (or\nsplitting-merging) of ILMs and hopping occur during the time evolution of ILMs.\n", "  We analyze the quantum quench dynamics in the formation of a phase-biased\nsuperconducting nanojunction. We find that in the absence of an external\nrelaxation mechanism and for very general conditions the system gets trapped in\na metastable state, corresponding to a non-equilibrium population of the\nAndreev bound states. The use of the time-dependent Full Counting Statistics\n(FCS) analysis allows us to extract information on the asymptotic population of\neven and odd manybody states, demonstrating that a universal behavior,\ndependent only on the Andreev states energy, is reached in the quantum point\ncontact limit. These results shed light on recent experimental observations on\nquasiparticle trapping in superconducting atomic contacts.\n", "  Charge transport at the Dirac point in bilayer graphene exhibits two\ndramatically different transport states, insulating and metallic, that occur in\napparently otherwise indistinguishable experimental samples. We demonstrate\nthat the existence of these two transport states has its origin in an interplay\nbetween evanescent modes, that dominate charge transport near the Dirac point,\nand disordered configurations of extended defects in the form of partial\ndislocations. In a large ensemble of bilayer systems with randomly positioned\npartial dislocations, the conductivity distribution $P(\\sigma)$ is found to be\nstrongly peaked at both the insulating and metallic limits. We argue that this\ndistribution form, that occurs only at the Dirac point, lies at the heart of\nthe observation of both metallic and insulating states in bilayer graphene.\n", "  For a given subcritical discrete Schr\\\"odinger operator $H$ on a weighted\ninfinite graph $X$, we construct a Hardy-weight $w$ which is optimal in the\nfollowing sense. The operator $H - \\lambda w$ is subcritical in $X$ for all\n$\\lambda < 1$, null-critical in $X$ for $\\lambda = 1$, and supercritical near\nany neighborhood of infinity in $X$ for any $\\lambda > 1$. Our results rely on\na criticality theory for Schr\\\"odinger operators on general weighted graphs.\n", "  The never-ending quest to improve the security of digital information\ncombined with recent improvements in hardware technology has caused the field\nof random number generation to undergo a fundamental shift from relying solely\non pseudo-random algorithms to employing optical entropy sources. Despite these\nsignificant advances on the hardware side, commonly used statistical measures\nand evaluation practices remain ill-suited to understand or quantify the\noptical entropy that underlies physical random number generation. We review the\nstate of the art in the evaluation of optical random number generation and\nrecommend a new paradigm: quantifying entropy generation and understanding the\nphysical limits of the optical sources of randomness. In order to do this, we\nadvocate for the separation of the physical entropy source from deterministic\npost-processing in the evaluation of random number generators and for the\nexplicit consideration of the impact of the measurement and digitization\nprocess on the rate of entropy production. We present the Cohen-Procaccia\nestimate of the entropy rate $h(\\epsilon,\\tau)$ as one way to do this. In order\nto provide an illustration of our recommendations, we apply the Cohen-Procaccia\nestimate as well as the entropy estimates from the new NIST draft standards for\nphysical random number generators to evaluate and compare three common optical\nentropy sources: single photon time-of-arrival detection, chaotic lasers, and\namplified spontaneous emission.\n", "  We argue that the proton's charge-radius contributes differently to shifts of\nHydrogen-like energy levels than naively expected due to an incorrect choice\nfor the boundary condition at the proton's position in standard calculations.\nIn particular we show how to obtain the correct boundary condition, which\ndepends on the charge radius itself in a predictable way. We argue this\ndifference in boundary conditions only matters when they are imposed at a\nradius $r=\\epsilon < Z \\alpha/m$ where $m$ is the orbiting-particle mass,\nbecause only then is the particle relativistic at these distances. The boundary\ncondition difference is therefore important for ordinary Hydrogen while not for\nmuonic Hydrogen. The boundary condition can be interpreted in terms of a second\ntype of nuclear moment, and a prediction is made for the proton-radius energy\nshift as a function of charge-radius, $r_p$, this second nuclear moment, $h$,\nand orbiting particle mass, $m$. The observed difference between electronic and\nmuonic contributions to the Lamb shift is accounted for with $r_p \\simeq 0.87$\nfm similar to its traditional value, and $2mh$ of order a few fm.\n", "  In this article we construct a relativistic extended metric theory of\ngravity, for which its weak field limit reduces to the non-relativistic\nMOdified Newtonian Dynamics regime of gravity. The theory is fully covariant\nand the way to achieve this is to introduce torsion in the description of\ngravity as well as with the addition of a particular function of the matter\nlagrangian into the gravitational action.\n", "  Planet formation is thought to occur in discs around young stars by the\naggregation of small dust grains into much larger objects. The growth from\ngrains to pebbles and from planetesimals to planets is now fairly well\nunderstood. The intermediate stage has however been found to be hindered by the\nradial-drift and fragmentation barriers. We identify a powerful mechanism in\nwhich dust overcomes both barriers. Its key ingredients are i) backreaction\nfrom the dust onto the gas, ii) grain growth and fragmentation, and iii)\nlarge-scale gradients. The pile-up of growing and fragmenting grains modifies\nthe gas structure on large scales and triggers the formation of pressure\nmaxima, in which particles are trapped. We show that these self-induced dust\ntraps are robust: they develop for a wide range of disc structures,\nfragmentation thresholds and initial dust-to-gas ratios. They are favored\nlocations for pebbles to grow into planetesimals, thus opening new paths\ntowards the formation of planets.\n", "  Reconnection in strong current-aligned magnetic guide fields allows for the\nexcitation of the electron-cyclotron-maser instability and emission of\nelectromagnetic radiationfrom the electron exhaust at the {\\sf X} point. The\nelectrons in the guide field remain magnetized, with reconnection barely\naffected. The guide field is responsible for the asymmetric properties of the\n{\\sf X} point and exhaust. Asymmetry in the electron population results in\nconditions favorable for ECMI. Fundamental mission beneath the guide field\ncyclotron is similar to electron hole emission discussed elsewhere. It can be\ntreated in the proper exhaust frame, and maps the local magnetic field when\nmoving together with the exhaust along the guide field. Many applications of\nthis mechanism can be imagined. We propose an outline of the mechanism and\ndiscuss some of its advantages and prospects. Among potential applications are\nAKR in auroral physics, various types of solar radio emissions during flares,\nplanetary emissions and several astrophysical scenarios involving the presence\nof strong fields and field-aligned currents. Escape of radiation from {\\sf X}\nis no problem. However, observation from remote requires traversing the\nstop-band of X modes and implies source displacements to weaker fields.\n", "  We report on progress towards performing precision measurements of parity\nviolation in Yb, in which the theoretical prediction for a strong\nweak-interaction-induced effect in the 6s^{2} ^{1}S_{0} \\rightarrow 5d6s\n^{3}D_{1} optical transition at 408 nm has already been confirmed, with a\nmeasurement of the effect at the \\approx 10 % level of accuracy. With a new\natomic-beam apparatus offering enhanced sensitivity, we are aiming at precisely\ndetermining the parity violation observable in Yb, which will allow us to probe\nthe distributions of neutrons in different isotopes, investigate physics beyond\nthe Standard Model, as well as to study intra-nucleus weak interactions,\nthrough an observation of the anapole moment of Yb nuclei with nonzero spin. We\npresent the experimental principle employed to probe atomic parity violation,\ndescribe our new apparatus, and discuss the attained experimental sensitivity\nas well as the methods for characterizing systematics in these measurements.\n", "  Statistical moments of particle multiplicities in heavy-ion collision\nexperiments are an important probe in the exploration of the phase diagram of\nstrongly interacting matter and, particularly, in the search for the QCD\ncritical end point. In order to appropriately interpret experimental measures\nof these moments, however, it is necessary to understand the role of\nexperimental limitations, as well as background contributions, providing\nexpectations on how critical behavior should be affected by them. We here\npresent a framework for calculating moments of particle multiplicities in the\npresence of correlations of both critical and spurious origins. We also include\neffects from resonance decay and a limited acceptance window, as well as\ndetector efficiency. Although we focus on second-order moments, for simplicity,\nan extension to higher-order moments is straightforward.\n", "  We perform a detailed analysis of the fundamental mode of non-radial\npulsations of color flavor locked strange stars. Solving the general\nrelativistic equations for non-radial pulsations for an equation of state\nderived within the MIT bag model, we calculate the frequency and the\ngravitational damping time of the fundamental mode for all the parametrizations\nof the equation of state that lead to self-bound matter.\n  Our results show that color flavor locked strange stars can emit\ngravitational radiation in the optimal range for present gravitational wave\ndetectors and that it is possible to constrain the equation of state's\nparameters if the fundamental oscillation mode is observed and the stellar mass\nis determined.\n  We also show that the $f$-mode frequency can be fitted as a function of the\nsquare root of the average stellar density $\\sqrt{M/R^3}$ by a single linear\nrelation that fits quite accurately the results for all parametrizations of the\nequation of state. All results for the damping time can also be fitted as a\nfunction of the compactness $M/R$ by a single empirical relation. Therefore, if\na given compact object is identified as a color flavor locked strange star\nthese two relations could be used to determine the mass and the radius from the\nknowledge of the frequency and the damping time of gravitational waves from the\n$f$ mode.\n", "  Physics of many-body systems where particles are restricted to move in two\nspatial dimensions is challenging and even controversial: On one hand, neither\nlong-range order nor Bose condensation may appear in infinite uniform 2D\nsystems at finite temperature, on the other hand this does not prohibit\nsuperfluidity or superconductivity. Moreover, 2D superconductors, such as\ncuprates, are among the systems with highest critical temperatures. Ultracold\natoms are a platform for studying 2D physics. Uniquely to other physical\nsystems, quantum statistics may be completely changed in an ultracold gas: an\natomic Fermi gas may be smoothly crossed over into a gas of Bose molecules (or\ndimers) by tuning interatomic interactions. We review recent experiments where\nsuch crossover has been demonstrated as well as critical phenomena in the\nFermi-to-Bose crossover. We also present simple theoretical models describing\nthe gas at different points of the crossover and compare the data to these and\nmore advanced models.\n", "  Secret coupling of neutrinos to a new light vector boson, $Z'$, with a mass\nsmaller than 100 MeV is motivated within a myriad of scenarios which are\ndesigned to explain various anomalies in particle physics and cosmology. Due to\nthe longitudinal component of the massive vector boson, the rates of three-body\ndecay of charged mesons ($M$) such as the pion and the kaon to the light lepton\nplus neutrino and $Z'$ ($M \\to l \\nu Z'$) are enhanced by a factor of\n$(m_M/m_{Z'})^2$. On the other hand, the standard two body decay $M \\to l \\nu$\nis suppressed by a factor of $(m_l/m_M)^2$ due to chirality. We show that in\nthe case of ($M \\to e \\nu Z^\\prime$), the enhancement of $m_M^4/m_e^2\nm_{Z^\\prime}^2\\sim 10^8-10^{10}$ relative to two-body decay ($M \\to e \\nu$)\nenables us to probe very small values of gauge coupling for $\\nu_e$. The\nstrongest bound comes from the $R_K\\equiv Br(K \\to e +\\nu)/Br(K \\to \\mu +\\nu)$\nmeasurement in the NA62 experiment. The bound can be significantly improved by\ncustomized searches for signals of three-body charged meson decay into the\npositron plus missing energy in the NA62 and/or PIENU data.\n", "  We study the properties of compact stars in the Randall-Sundrum II type\nbraneworld model. To this end, we solve the braneworld generalization of the\nstellar structure equations for a static fluid distribution with spherical\nsymmetry considering that the spacetime outside the star is described by a\nSchwarzschild metric. First, the stellar structure equations are integrated\nemploying the so called causal limit equation of state (EOS), which is\nconstructed using a well established EOS at densities below a fiducial density,\nand the causal EOS $P= \\rho$ above it. It is a standard procedure in general\nrelativistic stellar structure calculations to use such EOS for obtaining a\nlimit in the mass radius diagram, known as causal limit, above which no stellar\nconfigurations are possible if the EOS fulfills that the sound velocity is\nsmaller than the speed of light. We find that the equilibrium solutions in the\nbraneworld model can violate the general relativistic causal limit and, for\nsufficiently large mass they approach asymptotically to the Schwarzschild limit\n$M = 2 R$. Then, we investigate the properties of hadronic and strange quark\nstars using two typical EOSs. For masses below $\\sim 1.5 - 2 M_{\\odot}$, the\nmass versus radius curves show the typical behavior found within the frame of\nGeneral Relativity. However, we also find a new branch of stellar\nconfigurations that can violate the general relativistic causal limit and that\nin principle may have an arbitrarily large mass. The stars belonging to this\nnew branch are supported against collapse by the nonlocal effects of the bulk\non the brane. We also show that these stars are always stable under small\nradial perturbations. These results support the idea that traces of\nextra-dimensions might be found in astrophysics, specifically through the\nanalysis of masses and radii of compact objects.\n", "  We extend the two-flavor hard-wall holographic model of Erlich, Katz, Son and\nStephanov [Phys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\ {\\bf 95}, 261602 (2005)] to four flavors to\nincorporate strange and charm quarks. The model incorporates chiral and flavor\nsymmetry breaking and provides a reasonable description of masses and weak\ndecay constants of a variety of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial-vector\nstrange and charmed mesons. In particular, we examine flavor symmetry breaking\nin the strong couplings of the $\\rho$ meson to the charmed $D$ and $D^{*}$\nmesons. We also compute electromagnetic form factors of the $\\pi$, $\\rho$, $K$,\n$K^*$, $D$ and $D^*$ mesons. We compare our results for the $D$ and $D^*$\nmesons with lattice QCD data and other nonperturbative approaches.\n", "  Objectivity constitutes one of the main features of the macroscopic classical\nworld. An important aspect of the quantum-to-classical transition issue is to\nexplain how such a property arises from the microscopic quantum world.\nRecently, within the framework of open quantum systems, there has been proposed\nsuch a mechanism in terms of the, so-called, Spectrum Broadcast Structures.\nThese are multipartite quantum states of the system of interest and a part of\nits environment, assumed to be under an observation. This approach requires a\ndeparture from the standard open quantum systems methods, as the environment\ncannot be completely neglected. In the present work we study the emergence of\nsuch a state-structures in one of the canonical models of the condensed matter\ntheory: Spin-boson model, describing the dynamics of a two-level system coupled\nto an environment made up by a large number of harmonic oscillators. We pay\nmuch attention to the behavior of the model in the non-Markovian regime, in\norder to provide a testbed to analyze how the non-Markovian nature of the\nevolution affects the surfacing of a spectrum broadcast structure.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers present a remarkable\nmultifunctional material with potential to enable the development of a wide\nrange of novel devices. However, the functionalities observed often fall short\nof the expectation, which hinders the device development. Here we demonstrate\nthat the optical, catalytic, and thermal functionalities of TMDC monolayers can\nall be substantially enhanced by up to orders of magnitude with the\nintercalation of water molecules or small cations (H+ and Li+) between the\nmonolayers and underlying substrates. In contrast, the same molecules or\ncations adsorbed on top of the monolayers show negligible effects. We also\ndiscover two major roles of the intercalated species in the enhancement: doping\nthe monolayers and modifying the interaction of the monolayers with the\nsubstrate. The result points out a versatile and convenient strategy of using\nthe intercalation of molecules or ions to enhance the functionalities of TMDC\nmonolayers.\n", "  We investigate the gauge-invariant observables constructed by smearing the\ngraviton and inflaton fields by compactly supported tensors at linear order in\ngeneral single-field inflation. These observables correspond to gauge-invariant\nquantities that can be measured locally. In particular, we show that these\nobservables are equivalent to (smeared) local gauge-invariant observables such\nas the linearised Weyl tensor, which have better infrared properties than the\ngraviton and inflaton fields. Special cases include the equivalence between the\ncompactly supported gauge-invariant graviton observable and the smeared\nlinearised Weyl tensor in Minkowski and de Sitter spaces. Our results indicate\nthat the infrared divergences in the tensor and scalar perturbations in\nsingle-field inflation have the same status as in de Sitter space and are both\na gauge artefact, in a certain technical sense, at tree level.\n", "  Devising strategies for economic development in a globally competitive\nlandscape requires a solid and unbiased understanding of countries\ntechnological advancements and similarities among export products. Both can be\naddressed through the bipartite representation of the International Trade\nNetwork. In the present paper, we apply the recently proposed grand canonical\nprojection algorithm to uncover country and product communities. Contrary to\npast endeavors, our methodology, based on information theory, creates\nmonopartite projections in an unbiased and analytically tractable way. Single\nlinks between countries or products represent statistically significant\nsignals, which are not accounted for by null-models such as the Bipartite\nConfiguration Model. We find stable country communities reflecting the\nsocioeconomic distinction in developed, newly industrialized, and developing\ncountries. Furthermore, we observe product clusters based on the aforementioned\ncountry groups. Our analysis reveals the existence of a complicate structure in\nthe bipartite International Trade Network: apart from the diversification of\nexport baskets from the most basic to the most exclusive products, we observe a\nstatistically significant signal of an export specialization mechanism towards\nmore sophisticated products.\n", "  The relativistic Dirac equation in four-dimensional spacetime reveals a\ncoherent relation between the dimensions of spacetime and the degrees of\nfreedom of fermionic spinors. A massless Dirac fermion generates new symmetries\ncorresponding to chirality spin and charge spin as well as conformal scaling\ntransformations. With the introduction of intrinsic W-parity, a massless Dirac\nfermion can be treated as a Majorana-type or Weyl-type spinor in a\nsix-dimensional spacetime that reflects the intrinsic quantum numbers of\nchirality spin. A generalized Dirac equation is obtained in the six-dimensional\nspacetime with a maximal symmetry. Based on the framework of gravitational\nquantum field theory proposed in Ref. \\cite{YLWU} with the postulate of gauge\ninvariance and coordinate independence, we arrive at a maximally symmetric\ngravitational gauge field theory for the massless Dirac fermion in\nsix-dimensional spacetime. Such a theory is governed by the local spin gauge\nsymmetry SP(1,5) and the global Poincar\\'e symmetry P(1,5)= SO(1,5)$\\ltimes\nP^{1,5} $ as well as the charge spin gauge symmetry SU(2). The theory leads to\nthe prediction of doubly electrically charged bosons. A scalar field and\nconformal scaling gauge field are introduced to maintain both global and local\nconformal scaling symmetries. A generalized gravitational Dirac equation for\nthe massless Dirac fermion is derived in the six-dimensional spacetime. The\nequations of motion for gauge fields are obtained with conserved currents in\nthe presence of gravitational effects. The dynamics of the gauge-type\ngravifield as a Goldstone-like boson is shown to be governed by a conserved\nenergy-momentum tensor, and its symmetric part provides a generalized Einstein\nequation of gravity. An alternative geometrical symmetry breaking mechanism for\nthe mass generation of Dirac fermions is demonstrated.\n", "  Two-dimensional transition-metal-dichalcogenide semiconductors have emerged\nas promising candidates for optoelectronic devices with unprecedented\nproperties and ultra-compact performances. However atomically thin materials\nare highly sensitive to surrounding dielectric media, which imposes severe\nlimitations to their practical applicability. Hence for their suitable\nintegration into devices, the development of reliable encapsulation procedures\nthat preserve their physical properties are required. Here, the excitonic\nphotoluminescence of WSe2 monolayer flakes is assessed, at room temperature and\n10 K, on mechanically exfoliated flakes encapsulated with SiOx and AlxOy layers\nemploying chemical and physical deposition techniques. Conformal flakes coating\non untreated - non-functionalized - flakes is successfully demonstrated by all\nthe techniques except for atomic layer deposition, where a cluster-like oxide\ncoating is observed. No significant compositional or strain state changes in\nthe flakes are detected upon encapsulation by any of the techniques.\nRemarkably, our results evidence that the flakes' optical emission is strongly\ninfluenced by the quality of the encapsulating oxide - stoichiometry -. When\nthe encapsulation is carried out with slightly sub-stoichiometric oxides two\nremarkable phenomena are observed. First, there is a clear electrical doping of\nthe monolayers that is revealed through a dominant trion - charged exciton -\nroom-temperature photoluminescence. Second, a strong decrease of the monolayers\noptical emission is measured attributed to non-radiative recombination\nprocesses and/or carriers transfer from the flake to the oxide. Power- and\ntemperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements further confirm that\nstoichiometric oxides obtained by physical deposition lead to a successful\nencapsulation.\n", "  Spin patterns of spiral galaxies can be broadly separated into galaxies with\nclockwise (Z-wise) patterns and galaxies with counterclockwise (S-wise) spin\npatterns. While the differences between these patterns are visually noticeable,\nthey are a matter of the perspective of the observer, and therefore in a\nsufficiently large universe no other differences are expected between galaxies\nwith Z-wise and S-wise patterns. Here large datasets of spiral galaxies\nseparated by their spin patterns are used to show that spiral galaxies with\nZ-wise spin patterns are photometrically different from spiral galaxies with\nS-wise patterns. That asymmetry changes based on the direction of observation,\nsuch that the observed asymmetry in one hemisphere is aligned with the inverse\nobserved asymmetry in the opposite hemisphere. The results are consistent\nacross different sky surveys (SDSS and PanSTARRS) and analysis methods. The\nproximity of the most probable asymmetry axis to the galactic pole suggests\nthat the asymmetry might be driven by relativistic beaming. Annotated data from\nSDSS and PanSTARRS are publicly available.\n", "  The topological charge density and topological susceptibility are determined\nby multi-probing approximation using overlap fermions in quenched SU(3) gauge\ntheory. Then we investigate the topological structure of the quenched QCD\nvacuum, and compare it with results from the all-scale topological density, the\nresults are consistent. Random permuted topological charge density is used to\ncheck whether these structures represent underlying ordered properties.\nPseudoscalar glueball mass is extracted from the two-point correlation function\nof the topological charge density. We study $3$ ensembles of different lattice\nspacing $a$ with the same lattice volume $16^{3}\\times32$, the results are\ncompatible with the results of all-scale topological charge density, and the\ntopological structures revealed by multi-probing are much closer to all-scale\ntopological charge density than that by eigenmode expansion.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the next-to-minimal composite Higgs model with a\nSO(6)/SO(5) coset, whose pNGB sector includes a Standard Model singlet in\naddition to the usual Higgs doublet. The fermions are embedded in the\nrepresentation 6 of SO(6). We study the region of parameter space of the model\nwhere the radiatively generated potential has global minima with both the\ndoublet and the singlet fields developing vacuum expectation values. We\ninvestigate the consequences of kinetic and mass mixing between the Higgs and\nthe singlet scalar that arise in this framework. We demonstrate that the\nensuing doublet-singlet mixing can provide a handle to accommodate heavier\nresonances (top-partners) for a given compositeness scale as compared to the\nminimal composite Higgs model, thus relaxing the tension with the direct LHC\nbounds. The main phenomenological consequence of this is a sizable deviation of\nthe Higgs couplings from the Standard Model predictions. While the present\nexperimental precision in the measurement of the Higgs couplings still allows\nfor considerable release of this tension, future measurements of the Higgs\nbranching ratios with increased precision would lead to stringent constraints\non this setup.\n", "  We demonstrate theoretically that the characteristic feature of a 2D system\nundergoing $N$ consequent Lifshitz topological transitions is the occurrence of\nspikes of entropy per particle $s$ of a magnitude $\\pm \\ln 2/(J-1/2)$ with $2\n\\leq J \\leq N$ at low temperatures. We derive a general expression for $s$ as a\nfunction of chemical potential, temperature and gap magnitude for the gapped\nDirac materials. Inside the smallest gap, the dependence of $s$ on the chemical\npotential exhibits a dip-and-peak structure in the temperature vicinity of the\nDirac point. The spikes of the entropy per particles can be considered as a\nsignature of the Dirac materials. These distinctive characteristics of gapped\nDirac materials can be detected in transport experiments where the temperature\nis modulated in gated structures.\n", "  The collective magnetic excitations in the spin-orbit Mott insulator\n(Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$)$_2$IrO$_4$ ($x=0,\\,0.01,\\,0.04,\\, 0.1$) were investigated by\nmeans of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. We report significant magnon\nenergy gaps at both the crystallographic and antiferromagnetic zone centers at\nall doping levels, along with a remarkably pronounced momentum-dependent\nlifetime broadening. The spin-wave gap is accounted for by a significant\nanisotropy in the interactions between $J_\\text{eff}=1/2$ isospins, thus\nmarking the departure of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ from the essentially isotropic\nHeisenberg model appropriate for the superconducting cuprates.\n", "  By developing a hydrodynamic formalism, we investigate the expansion dynamics\nof the single-minimum phase of a binary spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein\ncondensate, after releasing from an external harmonic trap. We find that the\nexpansion of the condensate along the direction of the spin-orbit coupling is\ndramatically slowed down near the transition between the single-minimum phase\nand the plane-wave phase. Such a slow expansion, resembling a form of an\neffective localization, is due to the quenching of the superfluid motion which\nresults in a strong increase of the effective mass. In the single-minimum phase\nthe anisotropic expansion of the Bose gas, which is spin balanced at\nequilibrium, is accompanied by the emergence of a local spin polarization. Our\nanalytic scaling solutions emerging from hydrodynamic picture are compared with\na full numerical simulation based on the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations.\n", "  We propose a new type of moduli stabilization scenario where the\nsupersymmetric and supersymmetry-breaking minima are degenerate at the leading\nlevel. The inclusion of the loop-corrections originating from the matter fields\nresolves this degeneracy of vacua. Light axions are predicted in one of our\nmodels.\n", "  The Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE) is designed to\nsearch for neutrinoless double beta decay of 130Te with an array of 988 TeO2\nbolometers operating at temperatures around 10 mK. The experiment is currently\nbeing commissioned in Hall A of Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy. The\ngoal of CUORE is to reach a 90\\% C.L. exclusion sensitivity on the \\tect decay\nhalf-life of 9$\\times$10$^{25}$ years after 5\\,years of data taking. The main\nissue to be addressed to accomplish this aim is the rate of background events\nin the region of interest, which must not be higher than\n10$^{-2}$\\,counts/keV/kg/y. We developed a detailed Monte Carlo simulation,\nbased on results from a campaign of material screening, radioassays, and\nbolometric measurements, to evaluate the expected background. This was used\nover the years to guide the construction strategies of the experiment and we\nuse it here to project a background model for CUORE. In this paper we report\nthe results of our study and our expectations for the background rate in the\nenergy region where the peak signature of neutrinoless double beta decay of\n130Te is expected.\n", "  We describe a new model for image propagation through open air in the\npresence of changes in the index of refraction (e.g. due to turbulence) using\nthe theory of optimal transport. We describe the relationship between photon\ndensity, or image intensity, and the phase of the traveling wave and, together\nwith a least action principle, suggest a method for approximately recovering\nthe solution of the photon flow. By linking atmospheric propagation solutions\nto optimal transport, we provide a physics-based (as opposed to\nphenomenological) model for predicting turbulence-induced changes to sequences\nof images. Simulated and real data are utilized to validate and compare the\nmodel to other existing methods typically used to model this type of data.\nGiven its superior performance in describing experimental data, the new model\nsuggests new algorithms for a variety of atmospheric imaging applications.\n", "  The Kitaev honeycomb model is an approximate topological quantum error\ncorrecting code in the same phase as the toric code, but requiring only a\n2-body Hamiltonian. As a frustrated spin model, it is well outside the\ncommuting models of topological quantum codes that are typically studied, but\nits exact solubility makes it more amenable to analysis of effects arising in\nthis noncommutative setting than a generic topologically ordered Hamiltonian.\nHere we study quantum error correction in the honeycomb model using both\nanalytic and numerical techniques. We first prove explicit exponential bounds\non the approximate degeneracy, local indistinguishability, and correctability\nof the code space. These bounds are tighter than can be achieved using known\ngeneral properties of topological phases. Our proofs are specialized to the\nhoneycomb model, but some of the methods may nonetheless be of broader\ninterest. Following this, we numerically study noise caused by thermalization\nprocesses in the perturbative regime close to the toric code renormalization\ngroup fixed point. The appearance of non-topological excitations in this\nsetting has no significant effect on the error correction properties of the\nhoneycomb model in the regimes we study. Although the behavior of this model is\nfound to be qualitatively similar to that of the standard toric code in most\nregimes, we find numerical evidence of an interesting effect in the\nlow-temperature, finite-size regime where a preferred lattice direction emerges\nand anyon diffusion is geometrically constrained. We expect this effect to\nyield an improvement in the scaling of the lifetime with system size as\ncompared to the standard toric code.\n", "  Controlling the phases of matter is a challenge that spans from condensed\nmaterials to biological systems. Here, by imposing a geometric boundary\ncondition, we study controlled collective motion of Escherichia coli bacteria.\nA circular microwell isolates a rectified vortex from disordered vortices\nmasked in bulk. For a doublet of microwells, two vortices emerge but their\nspinning directions show transition from parallel to anti-parallel. A\nVicsek-like model for confined self-propelled particles gives the point where\ntwo spinning patterns occur in equal probability and one geometric quantity\ngoverns the transition as seen in experiments. This mechanism shapes rich\npatterns including chiral configurations in a quadruplet of microwells, thus\nrevealing a design principle of active vortices.\n", "  We present derivations of the contagion condition for a range of spreading\nmechanisms on families of generalized random networks and bipartite random\nnetworks. We show how the contagion condition can be broken into three\nelements, two structural in nature, and the third a meshing of the contagion\nprocess and the network. The contagion conditions we obtain reflect the\nspreading dynamics in a clear, interpretable way. For threshold contagion, we\ndiscuss results for all-to-all and random network versions of the model, and\ndraw connections between them.\n", "  We investigate the magneto-optical response of double Weyl semimetals whose\nenergy dispersion is intrinsically anisotropic. We find that in the presence of\na magnetic field, the most salient feature of the optical conductivity is a\nseries of resonant peaks with the corresponding frequencies scaling linearly\nwith the strength of the magnetic field. In addition, the optical conductivity\nis found to be anisotropic, with two of the three longitudinal components\nresiding at a linear background and the remaining one at a constant background.\nThe effects of chemical potential, temperature, impurity scattering, and\nparticle-hole symmetry breaking on the optical conductivity are also studied.\n", "  In this paper we consider a Lorentz-breaking extension of the theory for a\nreal massive scalar quantum field in the region between two large parallel\nplates, with our manner to break the Lorentz symmetry is CPT-even, aether-like.\nFor this system we calculated the Casimir energy considering different boundary\nconditions. It turns out to be that the Casimir energy strongly depends on the\ndirection of the constant vector implementing the Lorentz symmetry breaking, as\nwell as on the boundary conditions.\n", "  In this paper we revisit the idea of measuring the magnetic dipole moments of\nthe charm baryons and, in particular, of charmed Lambda by studying the spin\nprecession induced by the strong effective magnetic field inside the channels\nof a bent crystal. We present a detailed sensitivity study showing the\nfeasibility of such an experiment at the LHC in the coming years.\n", "  The Daya Bay, Double Chooz and RENO experiments recently observed a\nsignificant distortion in their detected reactor antineutrino spectra, being at\nodds with the current predictions. Although such a result suggests to revisit\nthe current reactor antineutrino spectra modeling, an alternative scenario,\nwhich could potentially explain this anomaly, is explored in this letter. Using\nan appropriate statistical method, a study of the Daya Bay experiment energy\nscale is performed. While still being in agreement with the {\\gamma}\ncalibration data and Boron 12 measured spectrum, it is shown that a O(1%)\ndeviation of the energy scale reproduces the distortion observed in the Daya\nBay spectrum, remaining within the quoted calibration uncertainties. Potential\norigins of such a deviation, which challenge the energy calibration of these\ndetectors, are finally discussed.\n", "  After decades of effort, the solar activity cycle is exceptionally well\ncharacterized but it remains poorly understood. Pioneering work at the Mount\nWilson Observatory demonstrated that other sun-like stars also show regular\nactivity cycles, and suggested two possible relationships between the rotation\nrate and the length of the cycle. Neither of these relationships correctly\ndescribe the properties of the Sun, a peculiarity that demands explanation.\nRecent discoveries have started to shed light on this issue, suggesting that\nthe Sun's rotation rate and magnetic field are currently in a transitional\nphase that occurs in all middle-aged stars. Motivated by these developments, we\nidentify the manifestation of this magnetic transition in the best available\ndata on stellar cycles. We propose a reinterpretation of previously published\nobservations to suggest that the solar cycle may be growing longer on stellar\nevolutionary timescales, and that the cycle might disappear sometime in the\nnext 0.8-2.4 Gyr. Future tests of this hypothesis will come from ground-based\nactivity monitoring of Kepler targets that span the magnetic transition, and\nfrom asteroseismology with the TESS mission to determine precise masses and\nages for bright stars with known cycles.\n", "  Collisions with background gas can perturb the transition frequency of\ntrapped ions in an optical atomic clock. We develop a non-perturbative\nframework based on a quantum channel description of the scattering process, and\nuse it to derive a master equation which leads to a simple analytic expression\nfor the collisional frequency shift. As a demonstration of our method, we\ncalculate the frequency shift of the Sr$^+$ optical atomic clock transition due\nto elastic collisions with helium.\n", "  Galaxies occupy different regions of the\n[OIII]$\\lambda5007$/H$\\beta$-versus-[NII]$\\lambda6584$/H$\\alpha$ emission-line\nratio diagram in the distant and local Universe. We investigate the origin of\nthis intriguing result by modelling self-consistently, for the first time,\nnebular emission from young stars, accreting black holes (BHs) and older,\npost-asymptotic-giant-branch (post-AGB) stellar populations in galaxy formation\nsimulations in a full cosmological context. In post-processing, we couple\nnew-generation nebular-emission models with high-resolution, cosmological\nzoom-in simulations of massive galaxies to explore which galaxy physical\nproperties drive the cosmic evolution of the optical-line ratios\n[OIII]$\\lambda5007$/H$\\beta$, [NII]$\\lambda6584$/H$\\alpha$,\n[SII]$\\lambda\\lambda6717,6731$/H$\\alpha$ and [OI]$\\lambda6300$/H$\\alpha$. The\nline ratios of simulated galaxies agree well with observations of both\nstar-forming and active local SDSS galaxies. Towards higher redshifts, at fixed\ngalaxy stellar mass, the average [OIII]/H$\\beta$ increases and [NII]/H$\\alpha$,\n[SII]/H$\\alpha$ and [OI]/H$\\alpha$ decrease -- widely consistent with\nobservations. At fixed stellar mass, we identify star formation history, which\ncontrols nebular emission from young stars via the ionization parameter, as the\nprimary driver of the cosmic evolution of [OIII]/H$\\beta$ and [NII]/H$\\alpha$.\nFor [SII]/H$\\alpha$ and [OI]/H$\\alpha$, this applies only to redshifts above\n$z=1.5$, the evolution at lower redshift being driven in roughly equal parts by\nnebular emission from AGN and post-AGB stars. Instead, changes in the hardness\nof ionizing radiation, ionized-gas density, the prevalence of BH accretion\nrelative to star formation and the dust-to-metal mass ratio (whose impact on\nthe gas-phase N/O ratio we model at fixed O/H) play at most a minor role in the\ncosmic evolution of simulated galaxy line ratios.\n", "  The diquark-diquark-antiquark model describes pentaquark states both in terms\nof quarks and hadrons. The latest LHCb data for pentaquarks with open charm\nemphasize the importance of hadron components in the structure of pentaquarks.\nWe discuss pentaquark states with hidden charm $P(\\bar c cuud)$ and those with\nopen charm $P(\\bar uussc)$ which were discovered recently in LHCb data ($J/\\Psi\np$ and $\\Xi_c^+ K^-$ spectra correspondingly). Considering the observed states\nas members of the lowest (s-wave) multiplet we discuss the mass splitting of\nstates and the dumping of their widths.\n", "  The explicit construction is presented of two-player game satisfying: (i)\nsymmetry with respect to the permutation of the players; (ii) the existence of\nupper bound on total payoff following from Bell inequality; (iii) the existence\nof unfair equilibrium with total payoff saturating the above bound. The quantum\ncounterpart of the game is considered which possesses only fair equilibria and\nstrategies outperforming the classical ones.\n", "  There exists various proposals to detect cosmic strings from Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) or 21 cm temperature maps. Current proposals do not aim to\nfind the location of strings on sky maps, all of these approaches can be\nthought of as a statistic on a sky map. We propose a Bayesian interpretation of\ncosmic string detection and within that framework, we derive a connection\nbetween estimates of cosmic string locations and cosmic string tension $G\\mu$.\nWe use this Bayesian framework to develop a machine learning framework for\ndetecting strings from sky maps and outline how to implement this framework\nwith neural networks. The neural network we trained was able to detect and\nlocate cosmic strings on noiseless CMB temperature map down to a string tension\nof $G\\mu=5 \\times10^{-9}$ and when analyzing a CMB temperature map that does\nnot contain strings, the neural network gives a 0.95 probability that\n$G\\mu\\leq2.3\\times10^{-9}$.\n", "  The recent birth of gravitational wave astronomy invites a new generation of\nprecision tests of general relativity. Signatures of black hole (BH) mergers\nmust be systematically explored in a wide spectrum of modified gravity\ntheories. Here, we turn to one such theory in which the initial value problem\nfor BH mergers is well posed, the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton system. We present\nconservative estimates for the merger parameters (final spins, quasinormal\nmodes) based on techniques that have worked well for ordinary gravity mergers\nand utilize information extracted from test particle motion in the final BH\nmetric. The computation is developed in parallel for the modified gravity BHs\n(we specifically focus on the Kaluza-Klein value of the dilaton coupling, for\nwhich analytic BH solutions are known) and ordinary Kerr-Newman BHs. We comment\non the possibility of obtaining final BHs with spins consistent with current\nobservations.\n", "  We use metasurfaces to enable acoustic orbital angular momentum (a-OAM) based\nmultiplexing in real-time, postprocess-free and sensor-scanning-free fashions\nto improve the bandwidth of acoustic communication, with intrinsic\ncompatibility and expandability to cooperate with other multiplexing\ntechnologies. The mechanism relied on encoding information onto twisted beams\nis numerically and experimentally demonstrated by realizing the real-time\npicture transfer, which differs from existing static data transfer by encoding\ndata onto OAM states. Our study can boost the capacity of acoustic\ncommunication links and offer potential to revolutionize relevant fields.\n", "  In the tumour microenvironment, cancer cells directly interact with both the\nimmune system and the stroma. It is firmly established that the immune system,\nhistorically believed to be a major part of the body's defence against tumour\nprogression, can be reprogrammed by tumour cells to be ineffective,\ninactivated, or even acquire tumour promoting phenotypes. Likewise, stromal\ncells and extracellular matrix can also have pro-and anti-tumour properties.\nHowever, there is strong evidence that the stroma and immune system also\ndirectly interact, therefore creating a tripartite interaction that exists\nbetween cancer cells, immune cells and tumour stroma. This interaction\ncontributes to the maintenance of a chronically inflamed tumour\nmicroenvironment with pro-tumorigenic immune phenotypes and facilitated\nmetastatic dissemination. A comprehensive understanding of cancer in the\ncontext of dynamical interactions of the immune system and the tumour stroma is\ntherefore required to truly understand the progression toward and past\nmalignancy.\n", "  This paper investigates the phenomenon of emergence of spatial curvature.\nThis phenomenon is absent in the Standard Cosmological Model, which has a flat\nand fixed spatial curvature (small perturbations are considered in the Standard\nCosmological Model but their global average vanishes, leading to spatial\nflatness at all times). This paper shows that with the nonlinear growth of\ncosmic structures the global average deviates from zero. The analysis is based\non the {\\em silent universes} (a wide class of inhomogeneous cosmological\nsolutions of the Einstein equations). The initial conditions are set in the\nearly universe as perturbations around the $\\Lambda$CDM model with $\\Omega_m =\n0.31$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.69$, and $H_0 = 67.8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. As the\ngrowth of structures becomes nonlinear, the model deviates from the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, and at the present instant if averaged over a domain ${\\cal\nD}$ with volume $V = (2150\\,{\\rm Mpc})^3$ (at these scales the cosmic variance\nis negligibly small) gives: $\\Omega_m^{\\cal D} = 0.22$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda^{\\cal\nD} = 0.61$, $\\Omega_{\\cal R}^{\\cal D} = 0.15$ (in the FLRW limit $\\Omega_{\\cal\nR}^{\\cal D} \\to \\Omega_k$), and $\\langle H \\rangle_{\\cal D} = 72.2$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$. Given the fact that low-redshift observations favor higher values\nof the Hubble constant and lower values of matter density, compared to the CMB\nconstraints, the emergence of the spatial curvature in the low-redshift\nuniverse could be a possible solution to these discrepancies.\n", "  It is known that some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) transited from type 1 to\ntype 2 or vice versa. There are two explanations for the so-called changing\nlook AGNs: one is the dramatic change of the obscuration along the\nline-of-sight, the other is the variation of accretion rate. In this paper, we\nreport the detection of large amplitude variations in the mid-infrared\nluminosity during the transitions in 10 changing look AGNs using WISE and newly\nreleased NEOWISE-R data. The mid-infrared light curves of 10 objects echoes the\nvariability in the optical band with a time lag expected for dust reprocessing.\nThe large variability amplitude is inconsistent with the scenario of varying\nobscuration, rather supports the scheme of dramatic change in the accretion\nrate.\n", "  We apply the theory of ground states for classical, finite, Heisenberg spin\nsystems previously published to a couple of spin systems that can be considered\nas finite models $K_{12},\\,K_{15}$ and $K_{18}$ of the AF Kagome lattice. The\nmodel $K_{12}$ is isomorphic to the cuboctahedron. In particular, we find\nthree-dimensional ground states that cannot be viewed as resulting from the\nwell-known independent rotation of subsets of spin vectors. For a couple of\nground states with translational symmetry we calculate the corresponding wave\nnumbers. Finally we study the model $K_{12w}$ without boundary conditions which\nexhibits new phenomena as, e.~g., two-dimensional families of three-dimensional\nground states.\n", "  We study certain deformations of abstract Brieskorn lattices in fixed\nabstract Gauss-Manin systems, and show that the ambiguity of expressions of\ndeformations coming from automorphisms of base spaces is essentially the same\nas the one coming from the choice of opposite filtrations, and hence is finite\ndimensional, although the freedom of parameters in the expressions of\ndeformations is infinite dimensional. As a consequence, we can prove the\nnon-existence of a versal deformation of the Fourier transform of this abstract\nBrieskorn lattice with expected dimension. This shows that the generation\ncondition is quite essential for the existence of versal deformations with\nexpected dimensions in the absolute case.\n", "  Optical diffraction tomography relies on solving an inverse scattering\nproblem governed by the wave equation. Classical reconstruction algorithms are\nbased on linear approximations of the forward model (Born or Rytov), which\nlimits their applicability to thin samples with low refractive-index contrasts.\nMore recent works have shown the benefit of adopting nonlinear models. They\naccount for multiple scattering and reflections, improving the quality of\nreconstruction. To reduce the complexity and memory requirements of these\nmethods, we derive an explicit formula for the Jacobian matrix of the nonlinear\nLippmann-Schwinger model which lends itself to an efficient evaluation of the\ngradient of the data- fidelity term. This allows us to deploy efficient methods\nto solve the corresponding inverse problem subject to sparsity constraints.\n", "  Based solely on the analytical properties of the single-particle Green's\nfunction of fermions at finite temperatures, we show that the generalized\nLuttinger theorem inherently possesses topological aspects. The topological\ninterpretation of the generalized Luttinger theorem can be introduced because\ni) the Luttinger volume is represented as the winding number of the\nsingle-particle Green's function and thus ii) the deviation of the theorem,\nexpressed with a ratio between the interacting and noninteracting\nsingle-particle Green's functions, is also represented as the winding number of\nthis ratio. The formulation based on the winding number naturally leads to two\ntypes of the generalized Luttinger theorem. Exploring two examples of\nsingle-band translationally invariant interacting electrons, i.e., simple metal\nand Mott insulator, we show that the first type falls into the original\nstatement for Fermi liquids given by Luttinger, while the second type\ncorresponds to the extended one for non metallic cases with no Fermi surface\ngeneralized by Dzyaloshinskii. This formulation also allows us to derive a\nsufficient condition for the validity of the Luttinger theorem of the first\ntype by applying the Rouche's theorem in complex analysis as an inequality.\nMoreover, we can rigorously prove in a non-perturbative manner, without\nassuming any detail of a microscopic Hamiltonian, that the generalized\nLuttinger theorem of both types is valid for generic interacting fermions as\nlong as the particle-hole symmetry is preserved. Finally, we show that the\nwinding number of the single-particle Green's function can also be associated\nwith the distribution function of quasiparticles, and therefore the number of\nquasiparticles is equal to the Luttinger volume.\n", "  We study the Josephson effect of a $\\rm{T_1 F T_2}$ junction, consisting of\nspin-triplet superconductors (T), a weak ferromagnetic metal (F), and\nferromagnetic insulating interfaces. Two types of the triplet order parameters\nare considered; $(k_x +ik_y)\\hat{z}$ and $k_x \\hat{x}+k_y\\hat{y}$. We compute\nthe current density in the ballistic limit by using the generalized\nquasiclassical formalism developed to take into account the interference effect\nof the multilayered ferromagnetic junction. We discuss in detail how the\ncurrent-phase relation is affected by orientations of the d-vectors of\nsuperconductor and the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic tunneling barrier.\nGeneral condition for the anomalous Josephson effect is also derived.\n", "  Resonant elastic X-ray scattering is a powerful technique for measuring\nmultipolar order parameters. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally\nstudy the possibility of using this technique to detect the proposed multipolar\norder parameters in URu$_2$Si$_2$ at the U-$L_{3}$ edge with the electric\nquadrupolar transition. Based on an atomic model, we calculate the azimuthal\ndependence of the quadrupolar transition at the U-$L_{3}$ edge. The results\nillustrate the potential of this technique for distinguishing different\nmultipolar order parameters. We then perform experiments on ultra-clean single\ncrystals of URu$_2$Si$_2$ at the U-$L_{3}$ edge to search for the predicted\nsignal, but do not detect any indications of multipolar moments within the\nexperimental uncertainty. We theoretically estimate the orders of magnitude of\nthe cross-section and the expected count rate of the quadrupolar transition and\ncompare them to the dipolar transitions at the U-$M_4$ and U-$L_3$ edges,\nclarifying the difficulty in detecting higher order multipolar order parameters\nin URu$_2$Si$_2$ in the current experimental setup.\n", "  The ground state energy of a many-electron system can be approximated by an\nvariational approach in which the total energy of the system is minimized with\nrespect to one and two-body reduced density matrices (RDM) instead of\nmany-electron wavefunctions. This problem can be formulated as a semidefinite\nprogramming problem. Due the large size of the problem, the well-known interior\npoint method can only be used to tackle problems with a few atoms. First-order\nmethods such as the the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) have\nmuch lower computational cost per iteration. However, their convergence can be\nslow, especially for obtaining highly accurate approximations. In this paper,\nwe present a practical and efficient second-order semi-smooth Newton type\nmethod for solving the SDP formulation of the energy minimization problem. We\ndiscuss a number of techniques that can be used to improve the computational\nefficiency of the method and achieve global convergence. Extensive numerical\nexperiments show that our approach is competitive to the state-of-the-art\nmethods in terms of both accuracy and speed.\n", "  The properties of the aperiodic variability in X-ray binaries with black\nholes are considered. The power spectra of the luminosity variability for a\nflat accretion disk that is an emission source with a power-law energy spectrum\nhave been modeled. At low frequencies the derived power spectrum has the form\nof a power law with a slope $\\rho\\approx-1$ and a cutoff at a frequency\napproximately equal to the fluctuations characteristic frequency at the disk\ninner edge; at higher frequencies the power spectrum has a complex form. The\nhigh-frequency variability is suppressed due to the arrival time delays of the\nphotons emerging in the different parts of the disk. The presence of azimuthal\naccretion rate fluctuations in the disk and the azimuthal non-uniformity of the\ndisk surface brightness in the observer's imaginary plane caused by the\nrelativistic effects give rise to an additional variability at frequencies\n$\\sim$200 Hz.\n", "  An overview of recent results on electroweak precision measurements from the\nCMS Collaboration is presented. Studies of the weak boson differential\ntransverse momentum spectra, Z boson angular coefficients, forward-backward\nasymmetry of Drell-Yan lepton pairs and charge asymmetry of W boson production\nare made in comparison to the state-of-the-art Monte Carlo generators and\ntheoretical predictions. The results show a good agreement with the Standard\nModel. As a proof of principle for future W mass measurements, a W-like\nanalysis of the Z boson mass is performed.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the TeV gamma-ray spectrum for the sources\nin the 2HWC HAWC catalog. Three spectrum models are considered in the analysis:\nsimple power law, power law with exponential cut-off and a log-parabola. A\ncomparison of the test statistic of nested models was performed in order to\nlook for the best description. We used gamma-ray sky maps of 17 and 25 months\nof HAWC data. From the analysis, only three sources of the catalog deviate from\nsimple power law spectrum with high significance. The corresponding parameters\nare given in each case.\n", "  A two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron production in high-energy\nnuclear collisions is applied to ensemble-mean $p_t$ (denoted by $\\bar p_t$)\ndata for $p$-$p$, $p$-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions from the relativistic heavy ion\ncollider (RHIC) and large hadron collider (LHC). This $\\bar p_t$ TCM is\ndirectly related to a recently-published TCM for the charge-multiplicity\n$n_{ch}$ and collision-energy dependence of $p_t$ spectrum data from $p$-$p$\ncollisions. Multiplicity dependence of the $p$-$p$ spectrum hard component\nobserved in the previous study is consistent with similar behavior for $\\bar\np_t$ hard component $\\bar p_{th}$. $p$-$p$ $\\bar p_t$ $n_{ch}$ dependence is\nobserved to follow a noneikonal trend for the TCM hard component (dijet\nproduction $\\propto n_{ch}^2$), whereas the trend for Pb-Pb collisions is\nconsistent with the eikonal approximation assumed for the Glauber A-A\ncentrality model. The $p$-Pb trend is intermediate, transitioning from the\nnoneikonal $p$-$p$ trend for more-peripheral collisions to an eikonal trend for\nmore-central collisions. The multiplicity dependence of participant number\n$N_{part}$ and binary-collision number $N_{bin}$ inferred from $p$-Pb $\\bar\np_t$ data differs strongly from a Glauber Monte Carlo model of that system. The\nrapid increase with $n_{ch}$ and large magnitude of $\\bar p_t$ for the $p$-$p$\nand $p$-Pb systems suggests that minimum-bias jets (TCM hard component)\ndominate $\\bar p_t$ variation. The trend for $\\bar p_{th}$ in Pb-Pb collisions\nis consistent with quantitative modification of jet formation in more-central\nA-A collisions.\n", "  The honey bees play a role of unquestioned relevance in nature and the\ncomprehension of the mechanisms affecting their population dynamic is of\nfundamental importance. As experimentally documented, the proper development of\na colony is related to the nest temperature, whose value is maintained around\nthe optimal value if the colony population is sufficiently large. Then, the\nenvironmental temperature, the way in which this influence the nest temperature\nand the colony population size, are variables closely linked to each other and\ndeserve to be taken into account in a model that aims to describe the\npopulation dynamics. In the present study, as first step, the continuous-time\nautonomous system proposed by Khoury, Myerscoug and Barron (KMB) in 2011 was\napproximated by means a Nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme in order to\nobtain a set of autonomous difference equations. Subsequently, with the aim to\nintroduce the seasonal effects, a nonautonomous version (NAKMB) was proposed\nand formulated in discrete-time domain via a NSFD scheme, by introducing a\ntime-dependent formulation for the queen bee laying rate and the recruitment\nrate coefficients. By means the phase-plane analysis was possible to deduce\nthat, with an appropriate choice of the parameters, the NAKMB model admits both\na limit cycle at nonzero population size and an equilibrium point marking the\ncolony collapse, depending on the initial population size.\n", "  Rare and flavour-changing neutral current decays of the B meson are an\nimportant probe in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. There have\nrecently been several anomalies in rare B decays, and lepton-universality\nmeasurements, specifically involving the $b\\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$ quark transition.\nThese results tend towards a non-Standard-Model interpretation. The Belle II\nexperiment is a next-generation b physics experiment located at SuperKEKB, an\nupgraded B factory $e^+e^-$ collider, in Tsukuba, Japan. The first collisions\nare expected in early 2018 with full physics data expected in 2019. This\ndocument describes prospects for several rare B decays at Belle II including\n$b\\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$ processes and others, such as $b\\to(s,\\,d)\\gamma$ and\n$b\\to s\\nu\\bar\\nu$. Areas where the Belle II program is complementary to that\nof the currently running LHCb experiment are highlighted.\n", "  In this thesis, we study the Hawking and Unruh effects in time-dependent\nsituations, as registered by localised spacetimes observers in several\nasymptotic situations.\n  (Full abstract inside document.)\n", "  We propose and experimentally demonstrate a photonic routing architecture\nthat can efficiently utilize the space of multi-plane (3D) photonic\nintegration. A wafer with three planes of amorphous silicon waveguides was\nfabricated and characterized, demonstrating $<3\\times10^{-4}$ dB loss per\nout-of-plane waveguide crossing, $0.05 \\pm 0.02 $ dB per interplane coupler,\nand microring resonators on three planes with a quality factors up to $8.2\n\\times 10^{4}$. We also explore a phase velocity mapping strategy to mitigate\nthe crosstalk between co-propagating waveguides on different planes. These\nresults expand the utility of 3D photonic integration for applications such as\noptical interconnects, neuromorphic computing and optical phased arrays.\n", "  This study considers the linear stability of Poiseuille-Rayleigh-B\\'enard\nflows, subjected to a transverse magnetic field to understand the instabilities\nthat arise from the complex interaction between the effects of shear, thermal\nstratification and magnetic damping. This fundamental study is motivated in\npart by the desire to enhance heat transfer in the blanket ducts of nuclear\nfusion reactors. In pure MHD flows, the imposed transverse magnetic field\ncauses the flow to become quasi-2D and exhibit disturbances that are localised\nto the horizontal walls. However, the vertical temperature stratification in\nRayleigh-B\\'enard flows feature convection cells that occupy the interior\nregion and therefore the addition of this aspect provides an interesting point\nfor investigation.\n  The linearised governing equations are described by the \\qtwod\\ model\nproposed by Sommeria and Moreau (1982) which incorporates a Hartmann friction\nterm, and the base flows are considered fully developed and 1D. The neutral\nstability curves for critical Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers, $Re_c$ and $Ra_c$,\nrespectively, as functions of Hartmann friction parameter $H$ have been\nobtained over $10^{-2}\\leq H\\leq10^4$. Asymptotic trends are observed as\n$H\\rightarrow\\infty$ following $Re_c\\propto H^{\\,1/2}$ and $Ra_c\\propto H$. The\nlinear stability analysis reveals multiple instabilities which alter the flow\nboth within the Shercliff boundary layers and the interior flow, with\nstructures consistent with features from plane Poiseuille and Rayleigh-B\\'enard\nflows.\n", "  We propose an approach to rapidly find the upper limit of separability\nbetween datasets that is directly applicable to HEP classification problems.\nThe most common HEP classification task is to use $n$ values (variables) for an\nobject (event) to estimate the probability that it is signal vs. background.\nMost techniques first use known samples to identify differences in how signal\nand background events are distributed throughout the $n$-dimensional variable\nspace, then use those differences to classify events of unknown type.\nQualitatively, the greater the differences, the more effectively one can\nclassify events of unknown type. We will show that the Mutual Information (MI)\nbetween the $n$-dimensional signal-background mixed distribution and the\nanswers for the known events, tells us the upper-limit of separation for that\nset of $n$ variables. We will then compare that value to the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence between the output distributions from a classifier to test whether\nit has extracted all possible information from the input variables. We will\nalso discuss speed improvements to a standard method for calculating MI.\n  Our approach will allow one to: a) quickly measure the maximum possible\neffectiveness of a large number of potential discriminating variables\nindependent of any specific classification algorithm, b) identify potential\ndiscriminating variables that are redundant, and c) determine whether a\nclassification algorithm has achieved the maximum possible separation. We test\nthese claims first on simple distributions and then on Monte Carlo samples\ngenerated for Supersymmetry and Higgs searches. In all cases, we were able to\na) predict the separation that a classification algorithm would reach, b)\nidentify variables that carried no additional discriminating power, and c)\nidentify whether an algorithm had reached the optimum separation. Our code is\npublicly available.\n", "  We consider the Sen limit of several global F-theory compactifications, some\nof which exhibit an MSSM-like spectrum. We show that these indeed have a\nconsistent limit where they can be viewed as resulting from an intersecting\nD-brane configuration in type IIB. We discuss the match of the fluxes and the\nchiral spectrum in detail. We find that some D5-tadpole canceling gauge fluxes\ndo not lift to harmonic vertical four-form fluxes in F-theory. We discuss the\nconnection between splitting of curves at weak coupling and remnant discrete\nsymmetries.\n", "  In this first paper of a series of two we are going to show that, on the\nground of few reasonable hypotheses, an equation linking the number of vehicle\nN($\\tau_i$), that run from (i-1)-th to the i-th hour, to the ground-level\nhourly average measured values of an arbitrary pollutant concentration,\n$C(\\tau_i,z=0)=C(\\tau_i)$, can be established. The traffic environmental model\nso generated is validated via a fuzzy logig approach. In a second paper we will\nvalitadeted and calibrated it via a manual counting of traffic fluxes and its\nprovisional capability will be tessted\n", "  One of the most straightforward, direct and efficient approaches to Image\nSegmentation is Image Thresholding. Multi-level Image Thresholding is an\nessential viewpoint in many image processing and Pattern Recognition based\nreal-time applications which can effectively and efficiently classify the\npixels into various groups denoting multiple regions in an Image. Thresholding\nbased Image Segmentation using fuzzy entropy combined with intelligent\noptimization approaches are commonly used direct methods to properly identify\nthe thresholds so that they can be used to segment an Image accurately. In this\npaper a novel approach for multi-level image thresholding is proposed using\nType II Fuzzy sets combined with Adaptive Plant Propagation Algorithm (APPA).\nObtaining the optimal thresholds for an image by maximizing the entropy is\nextremely tedious and time consuming with increase in the number of thresholds.\nHence, Adaptive Plant Propagation Algorithm (APPA), a memetic algorithm based\non plant intelligence, is used for fast and efficient selection of optimal\nthresholds. This fact is reasonably justified by comparing the accuracy of the\noutcomes and computational time consumed by other modern state-of-the-art\nalgorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search\nAlgorithm (GSA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA).\n", "  In view of momentum continuity at a temporal slab, it is shown that\ninstantaneous switching of an isotropic medium to an anisotropic medium offers\nthe incident frequency a directional property- a counterintuitive process which\nis called frequency vectoralization. By expressing the dispersion diagrams\nbefore and after the temporal transition, a general analogy between spatial and\ntemporal interfaces is given and the concept of frequency birefringence, i.e.\ndouble frequency jump, will be explained. Furthermore, it will be shown that an\nanisotropic temporal interface diffracts a monochromatic beam in both the\nspatial and spectral domains.\n", "  The need to extract oil from wells where it is embedded on the surfaces of\nrocks has led to the development of new and improved enhanced oil recovery\ntechniques. One of those is the injection of surfactants with water vapor,\nwhich promotes desorption of oil that can then be extracted using pumps, as the\nsurfactants encapsulate the oil in foams. However, the mechanisms that lead to\nthe optimal desorption of oil and the best type of surfactants to carry out\ndesorption are not well known yet, which warrants the need to carry out basic\nresearch on this topic. In this work, we report non equilibrium dissipative\nparticle dynamics simulations of model surfactants and oil molecules adsorbed\non surfaces, with the purpose of studying the efficiency of the surfactants to\ndesorb hydrocarbon chains, that are found adsorbed over flat surfaces. The\nmodel surfactants studied correspond to nonionic and cationic surfactants, and\nthe hydrocarbon desorption is studied as a function of surfactant concentration\nunder increasing Poiseuille flow. We obtain various hydrocarbon desorption\nisotherms for every model of surfactant proposed, under flow. Nonionic\nsurfactants are found to be the most effective to desorb oil and the mechanisms\nthat lead to this phenomenon are presented and discussed.\n", "  Theoretical analyses of radiation pressure and photon momentum in the past\n150 years have focused almost exclusively on classical and/or quantum theories\nof electrodynamics. In these analyses, Maxwell's equations, the properties of\npolarizable and/or magnetizable material media, and the stress tensors of\nMaxwell, Abraham, Minkowski, Chu, and Einstein-Laub have typically played\nprominent roles. Each stress tensor has subsequently been manipulated to yield\nits own expressions for the electromagnetic (EM) force, torque, energy, and\nlinear as well as angular momentum densities of the EM field. This paper\npresents an alternative view of radiation pressure from the perspective of\nthermal physics, invoking the properties of blackbody radiation in conjunction\nwith empty as well as gas-filled cavities that contain EM energy in thermal\nequilibrium with the container's walls. In this type of analysis, Planck's\nquantum hypothesis, the spectral distribution of the trapped radiation, the\nentropy of the photon gas, and Einstein's A and B coefficients play central\nroles.\n", "  The (tree) amplituhedron A(n,k,m) is the image in the Grassmannian Gr(k,k+m)\nof the totally nonnegative part of Gr(k,n), under a (map induced by a) linear\nmap which is totally positive. It was introduced by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka in\n2013 in order to give a geometric basis for the computation of scattering\namplitudes in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In the case relevant to\nphysics (m=4), there is a collection of recursively-defined 4k-dimensional BCFW\ncells in the totally nonnegative part of Gr(k,n), whose images conjecturally\n\"triangulate\" the amplituhedron--that is, their images are disjoint and cover a\ndense subset of A(n,k,4). In this paper, we approach this problem by first\ngiving an explicit (as opposed to recursive) description of the BCFW cells. We\nthen develop sign-variational tools which we use to prove that when k=2, the\nimages of these cells are disjoint in A(n,k,4). We also conjecture that for\narbitrary even m, there is a decomposition of the amplituhedron A(n,k,m)\ninvolving precisely M(k, n-k-m, m/2) top-dimensional cells (of dimension km),\nwhere M(a,b,c) is the number of plane partitions contained in an a x b x c box.\nThis agrees with the fact that when m=4, the number of BCFW cells is the\nNarayana number N(n-3, k+1).\n", "  Subgrid-scale (SGS) models are critical in large-eddy simulations (LES) of\nturbulent flows. In this paper we conduct a comparative study on different SGS\nmodels, including one-k-equation, wall-adapting local eddy-viscosity (WALE),\nSigma and shear-constrained model. Wall-resolved LES simulations of channel\nflows are performed with a finite volume code at shear Reynolds number Re_\\tau\n= 395. In the simulations, the buffer sublayer turns out to be the most\nsensitive to the SGS model. Through the analysis of the mean velocity, the\nsecond-order moments, the SGS viscosity and the fluctuating vorticities, it is\nshown that the WALE and Sigma model outperform others significantly in terms of\nfluctuations while the constrained model improves slightly the mean velocity.\nThe results also indicate that the SGS dissipation influences strongly the\nvelocity fluctuations but not the mean flow nor the log-layer mismatch.\n", "  Epitaxy forms the basis of modern electronics and optoelectronics. We report\ncoherent atomically-thin superlattices, in which different transition metal\ndichalcogenide monolayers--despite large lattice mismatches--are repeated and\nintegrated without dislocations. Grown by a novel omnidirectional epitaxy,\nthese superlattices display fully-matched lattice constants across\nheterointerfaces while maintaining a surprisingly isotropic lattice structure\nand triangular symmetry. This strong epitaxial strain is precisely engineered\nvia the nanoscale supercell dimensions, thereby enabling broad tuning of the\noptical properties and producing photoluminescence peak shifts as large as 250\nmeV. We present theoretical models to explain this coherent growth as well as\nthe energetic interplay governing the flat-rippled configuration space in these\nstrained monolayers. Such coherent superlattices provide novel building blocks\nwith targeted functionalities at the atomically-thin monolayer limit.\n", "  We describe a class of cellular automata (CAs) that are end-to-end\ndifferentiable. DCAs interpolate the behavior of ordinary CAs through rules\nthat act on distributions of states. The gradient of a DCA with respect to its\nparameters can be computed with an iterative propagation scheme that uses\npreviously-computed gradients and values. Gradient-based optimization over DCAs\ncould be used to find ordinary CAs with desired properties.\n", "  Existence of non-ergodic ground states is considered as a precursor to a\nfirst order long range magnetostructural transformation.\nMn$_3$Ga$_{0.45}$Sn$_{0.55}$C lies compositionally between two compounds,\nMn$_3$GaC and Mn$_3$SnC, undergoing first order magnetic transformation.\nMn$_3$Ga$_{0.45}$Sn$_{0.55}$C though crystallizes in single phase cubic\nstructure, exhibits more than one long range magnetic transitions. Using a\ncombination of magnetization, ac susceptibility, neutron diffraction and XAFS\ntechniques it is shown that, though Mn$_3$Ga$_{0.45}$Sn$_{0.55}$C exhibits long\nrange magnetic order, it presents a cluster glassy ground state due to\nformation of magnetically ordered Ga rich and Sn rich clusters. The clusters\nare big enough to present signatures of long range magnetic order but are\ndistributed in such way that it limits interactions between two clusters of the\nsame type leading to a frozen magnetic state at low temperatures. The main\nreason for such a cluster glass state is the difference in local structure of\nMn atoms that find themselves in Ga rich and Sn rich clusters.\n", "  Most of the applications of the nano structures dependent on the morphology\nwhich affects the opto electronics properties. This research article provides a\npathway of guiding optical properties like band-gap and fluorescence properties\nby controlled growth of nano-rods, -flowers, -needles or- tubes without\nexternal chemical doping, by simple hydro thermal method by controlling over\nsynthesis parameter, temperature.\n", "  In this letter, we have investigated the third-order optical nonlinearities\nof high-quality Ni doped ZnO nanorods crystallized in wurtzite lattice,\nprepared by the wet chemical method. In our experiments, we found that the two\nphoton absorption coefficient beta increases by as much as 14 times i.e. 7.6\nerr 0.4 to 112 err 6 cm per GW, when the Ni doping is increased from 0 to 10\npercent. The substantial enhancement in beta is discussed in terms of the\nbandgap scaling and Ni doping. Furthermore, we also show that the optical\nbandgap measured by UVVis and photo luminescence spectroscopic, continuously\nred shift with increasing Ni doping concentration. We envision that the strong\nnonlinear optical properties together with their dilute magnetic effects, they\nform an important class of materials for potential applications in\nmagneto-optical and integrated optical chips.\n", "  ZnO nanostructured films were prepared by chemical bath deposition method on\nglass substrates without any assistance of either microwave or high pressure\nautoclaves. The effect of solute concentration on the pure wurtzite ZnO\nnanostructure morphologies is studied. The controlling of the solute\nconcentration help to control nano-structure in the form of nano-needles, and\nrods.\n", "  In this study, we report the enhancement in field emission (FE) properties of\nZnO nanostructure by Ni doping at the base pressure of ~1 x 10-8 mbar, which\nwere grown by the simple wet chemical process. ZnO nanostructure shows single\ncrystalline wurtzite structure up to Ni 10% doping. FESEM represents change in\nthe nanostructure morphology from thick nanoneedles to nanoflakes via thin\nnanorods with increase in Ni doped ZnO. The turn-on field required to draw a\nfield emission (FE) current density at 1{\\mu}A/cm2 is found to be 2.5, 2.3, 1.8\nand 1.7 V/{\\mu}m for ZnO(Ni0%), ZnO(Ni5%), ZnO(Ni7.5%) and ZnO(Ni10%),\nrespectively.\n", "  It has been shown that black holes could be used as particle accelerators to\ncreate arbitrarily high center-of-mass (CM) energy if certain critical\nconditions are satisfied. Most studies so far are confined in four-dimensional\nspacetimes. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis on five-dimensional\nMyers-Perry black holes and find some novel properties compared to\nfour-dimensional Kerr black holes. Firstly, we give a rigorous proof that\nuntrhigh energy collisions cannot occur near a five-dimensional nonextremal\nblack hole. Secondly, For extremal black holes, we find a critical condition on\nthe particles' parameters causing ultraenergetic collisions. Thirdly, when the\nspacetime contains a naked singularity, we show that the CM energy could\ndiverge at the singularity if one of the particle just bounces back at the\nsingularity. Finally, we explore a special and important case where the naked\nsingularity just begins to form. Surprisingly, the ultraenergetic collisions do\nnot need any fine-turning in that case. However, we find that one of the\nconserved angular momentums must be nonzero.\n", "  In this study, the effect of Sr- and Ni-doping on microstructural,\nmorphological and sensing properties of ZnO nanorods has been investigated.\nNanorods with different Sr and Ni loadings were prepared using a simple wet\nchemical method and characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence (PL) analysis. XRD data\nconfirmed that Sr- and Ni-doped samples maintainsthe wurtzite hexagonal\nstructure of pure ZnO. However, unlikes Sr, Ni doping modifies the nanorod\nmorphology, increases the surface area (SA) and decreases the ratio of\nIUV/Igreen photoluminescence peak to a greater extent. Sensing tests were\nperformed on thick films resistive planar devices for monitoring CO and CO2, as\nindicators of indoor air quality.The effect of the operating temperature,\nnature and loading of dopant on the sensibility and selectivity of the\nfabricated sensors towards these two harmful gases were investigated. The gas\nsensing characteristics of Ni- and Sr-doped ZnO based sensors showed a\nremarkable enhancement (i. e. the response increased and shifted towards lower\ntemperature for both gases) compared to ZnO-based one, demonstrating that these\nZnO nanostructures are promising to fabricate sensor devices for monitoring\nindoor air quality.\n", "  Sr doped ZnO nanorods thin films are prepared using wet chemical technique on\ntransparent flexible substrate. Effect of Sr doping on structural and optical\nproperties of ZnO is systematically investigated. The sensing property of the\nZnO is enhanced by Sr doping and imitates as a promising material for future\ntoxic and flammable gas sensor applications as well as for optoelectronic\ndevices.\n", "  The origin of room temperature (RT) ferromagnetism (FM) in Ni doped ZnO\nsamples are systematically investigated through physical, optical, and magnetic\nproperties of nanostructure, prepared by simple low-temperature wet chemical\nmethod. Reitveld refinement of X-ray diffraction pattern displays an increase\nin lattice parameters with strain relaxation and contraction in Zn/O occupancy\nratio by means of Ni-doping. Similarly scanning electron microscope\ndemonstrates modification in the morphology from nanorods to nanoflakes with Ni\ndoping, suggests incorporation of Ni ions in ZnO. More interestingly, XANES\n(X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy) measurements confirm that Ni is being\nincorporated in ZnO as Ni2+. EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure)\nanalysis reveals that structural disorders near the Zn sites in the ZnO samples\nupsurges with increasing Ni concentration. Raman spectroscopy exhibits\nadditional defect driven vibrational mode at 275 cm-1, appeared with Ni-doped\nsample only and the shift with broadening in 580 cm-1 peak, which manifests the\npresence of the oxygen vacancy (VO) related defects. Moreover, in\nphotoluminescence (PL) spectra we observed peak appears at 524 nm, indicates\nthe presence of singly ionized VO+, which may activate bound magnetic polarons\n(BMPs) in dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs). Magnetization measurements\nindicate weak ferromagnetism at RT, which rises with increasing Ni\nconsolidation. It is therefore proposed that effect of the Ni-ions as well as\nthe inherent exchange interactions rising from VO+ assist to produce BMPs,\nwhich are accountable for the RT-FM in Zn1-xNixO (0<x<0.125) system.\n", "  We show the method for constructing nonspreading wave packets whose shape and\nmotion can be general. We analyze the time evolution of nonspreading wave\npackets by decomposing the Hamiltonian into two parts. Of the two, one changes\nthe instantaneous state, the other does not. Through this decomposition, the\ntime evolution operator is shown to be effectively a spatial shifting operator.\nThis explains why nonspreading wave packets can be nonspreading. And we show\nthat the part of the Hamiltonian which changes the instantaneous state governs\nthe motion of the nonspreading wave packets.\n", "  We consider one-dimensional Mott variable-range hopping with a bias, and\nprove the linear response as well as the Einstein relation, under an assumption\non the exponential moments of the distances between neighboring points. In a\nprevious paper \\cite{FGS} we gave conditions on ballisticity, and proved that\nin the ballistic case the environment viewed from the particle approaches, for\nalmost any initial environment, a given steady state which is absolutely\ncontinuous with respect to the original law of the environment. Here, we show\nthat this bias--dependent steady state has a derivative at zero in terms of the\nbias (linear response), and use this result to get the Einstein relation. Our\napproach is new: instead of using e.g. perturbation theory or regeneration\ntimes, we show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the bias--dependent steady\nstate with respect to the equilibrium state in the unbiased case satisfies an\n$L^p$-bound, $p>2$, uniformly for small bias. This $L^p$-bound yields, by a\ngeneral argument not involving our specific model, the statement about the\nlinear response.\n", "  Purpose: Siemens has developed several iterative reconstruction (IR)\nalgorithms on their CT scanners. SAFIRE is available on most of their CT\nscanners. The latest algorithm, ADMIRE, is available on their newest high-end\nCT scanners. The aim of our study was to compare the noise reduction properties\nof the two IR algorithms using objective methods. Methods and Materials: The\nhomogeneous module of the Catphan phantom was scanned on a Siemens AS+ and a\nSiemens Flash CT scanner using an axial abdomen protocol with fixed tube\ncurrent at two dose levels. The images were reconstructed with an abdomen\nfilter (B30) using filtered back projection (FBP) and a low, medium, and high\nlevel of SAFIRE or ADMIRE. Noise Power Spectrum (NPS) curves were calculated\nusing these images. Then, an anthropomorphic abdomen phantom (Kyoto Kagaku\nPH-5) was scanned using the same setup and exposure parameters. Fifty axial\nimages at the same slice location were used to calculate inter-image standard\ndeviation maps. Results: At full dose, the median values of the NPS curves were\nsimilar for both scanners at all IR levels. At low dose the median values of\nthe NPS curves were generally shifted towards lower spatial frequencies,\nusually resulting in a more blotchy image texture. This shift was more\nprominent for ADMIRE compared to SAFIRE for all IR levels. Based on the\ninter-image standard deviation maps of the anthropomorphic phantom, ADMIRE\nremoved noise near edges more efficiently than SAFIRE. Conclusion: No\nsignificant improvement in maintaining noise structure were found for the\nADMIRE algorithm. Based on the inter-image standard deviation maps, ADMIRE\nremoved noise near edges more efficiently than SAFIRE.\n", "  Convection in the metallic cores of terrestrial planets is likely to be\nsubjected to lateral variations in heat flux through the outer boundary imposed\nby creeping flow in the overlying silicate mantles. Boundary anomalies can\nsignificantly influence global diagnostics of core convection when the Rayleigh\nnumber, $Ra$, is weakly supercritical; however, little is known about the\nstrongly supercritical regime appropriate for planets. We perform numerical\nsimulations of rapidly rotating convection in a spherical shell geometry and\nimpose two patterns of boundary heat flow heterogeneity: a hemispherical\n$Y_1^1$ spherical harmonic pattern; and one derived from seismic tomography of\nEarth's lower mantle. We consider Ekman numbers $10^{-4} \\le E \\le 10^{-6}$,\nflux-based Rayleigh numbers up to $\\sim800$ times critical, and Prandtl number\nunity. The amplitude of the lateral variation in heat flux is characterised by\n$q_{\\rm L}^*=0, 2.3, 5.0$, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the outer boundary\nheat flux divided by its mean. We find that the Nusselt number, $Nu$, can be\nincreased by up to $\\sim25$\\% relative to the equivalent homogeneous case due\nto boundary-induced correlations between the radial velocity and temperature\nanomalies near the top of the shell. The $Nu$ enhancement tends to become\ngreater as the amplitude and length scale of the boundary heterogeneity are\nincreased and as the system becomes more supercritical. This $Ra$ dependence\ncan steepen the $Nu \\propto Ra^\\gamma$ scaling in the rotationally dominated\nregime, with $\\gamma$ for our most extreme case approximately $20\\%$ greater\nthan the equivalent homogeneous scaling. Therefore, it may be important to\nconsider boundary heterogeneity when extrapolating numerical results to\nplanetary conditions.\n", "  The anti-perovskite superconductor MgC$_{0.93}$Ni$_{2.85}$ was studied using\nhigh-resolution x-ray Compton scattering combined with electronic structure\ncalculations. Compton scattering measurements were used to determine\nexperimentally a Fermi surface that showed good agreement with that of our\nsupercell calculations, establishing the presence of the predicted hole and\nelectron Fermi surface sheets. Our calculations indicate that the Fermi surface\nis smeared by the disorder due to the presence of vacancies on the C and Ni\nsites, but does not drastically change shape. The 20\\% reduction in the Fermi\nlevel density-of-states would lead to a significant ($\\sim 70\\%$) suppression\nof the superconducting $T_c$ for pair-forming electron-phonon coupling.\nHowever, we ascribe the observed much smaller $T_c$ reduction at our\ncomposition (compared to the stoichiometric compound) to the suppression of\npair-breaking spin fluctuations.\n", "  Triggering vacuum breakdown at the upcoming laser facilities can provide\nrapid electron-positron pair production for studies in laboratory astrophysics\nand fundamental physics. However, the density of the emerging plasma should\nseemingly stop rising at the relativistic critical density, when the plasma\nbecomes opaque. Here we identify the opportunity of breaking this limit using\noptimal beam configuration of petawatt-class lasers. Tightly focused laser\nfields allow plasma generation in a small focal volume much less than\n${\\lambda}^3$, and creating extreme plasma states in terms of density and\nproduced currents. These states can be regarded as a new object of nonlinear\nplasma physics. Using 3D QED-PIC simulations we demonstrate the possibility of\nreaching densities of more than $10^{25}$ cm$^{-3}$, which is an order of\nmagnitude higher than previously expected. Controlling the process via the\ninitial target parameters gives the opportunity to reach the discovered plasma\nstates at the upcoming laser facilities.\n", "  For vertical velocity field $v_{\\rm z} (r,z;R)$ of granular flow through an\naperture of radius $R$, we propose a size scaling form $v_{\\rm z}(r,z;R)=v_{\\rm\nz} (0,0;R)f (r/R_{\\rm r}, z/R_{\\rm z})$ in the region above the aperture. The\nlength scales $R_{\\rm r}=R- 0.5 d$ and $R_{\\rm z}=R+k_2 d$, where $k_2$ is a\nparameter to be determined and $d$ is the diameter of granule. The effective\nacceleration, which is derived from $v_{\\rm z}$, follows also a size scaling\nform $a_{\\rm eff} = v_{\\rm z}^2(0,0;R)R_{\\rm z}^{-1} \\theta (r/R_{\\rm r},\nz/R_{\\rm z})$. For granular flow under gravity $g$, there is a boundary\ncondition $a_{\\rm eff} (0,0;R)=-g$ which gives rise to $v_{\\rm z} (0,0;R)=\n\\sqrt{ \\lambda g R_{\\rm z}}$ with $\\lambda=-1/\\theta (0,0)$. Using the size\nscaling form of vertical velocity field and its boundary condition, we can\nobtain the flow rate $W =C_2 \\rho \\sqrt{g } R_{\\rm r}^{D-1} R_{\\rm z}^{1/2} $,\nwhich agrees with the Beverloo law when $R \\gg d$. The vertical velocity fields\n$v_z (r,z;R)$ in three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) hoppers have\nbeen simulated using the discrete element method (DEM) and GPU program.\nSimulation data confirm the size scaling form of $v_{\\rm z} (r,z;R)$ and the\n$R$-dependence of $v_{\\rm z} (0,0;R)$.\n", "  It is shown that the self-similar ansatz proposed by T. Hou and G. Luo to\ndescribe a singular solution of the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations leads,\nwithout assuming any asymptotic condition on the self-similar profiles, to an\nover-determined system of partial differential equations that produces two\nfamilies of solutions: a class of trivial solutions in which the vorticity\nfield is identically zero, and a family of solutions that blow-up immediately,\nwhere the vorticity field is governed by a stationary regime. In any case, the\nanalytical properties of these solutions are not consistent with the numerical\nobservations reported by T. Hou and G. Luo. Therefore, this result is a\nrefinement of the previous work published by D. Chae and T.-P. Tsai on this\nmatter, where the authors found the trivial class of solutions under a certain\ndecay condition of the blow-up profiles.\n", "  We recognise the appearance of a Focus Point (FP) in the transverse momentum\ndistribution of either leptons originating from a BSM $Z^\\prime$-boson decay,\nafter a simple normalisation procedure. Exploring the properties of the FP we\nwill be able to define in a general way a new observable, the Focus Point\nAsymmetry ($A_{\\rm FP}$), which can be used to set constrains on the $Z^\\prime$\nwidth. We discuss the potential and the sensitivity of the $A_{\\rm FP}$ in as\ndiagnostic tool for $Z^\\prime$ physics, considering various $Z^\\prime$\nphenomenological realisations.\n", "  Recent results on searches for Beyond Standard Model production of Higgs\nbosons in fermion decay channels are presented. The analyses are based on\nproton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment at 7, 8, and 13 TeV\ncentre-of-mass energies. The exclusion limits determined by the null results of\nthe searches are interpreted in the framework of models that include extensions\nof the standard Higgs sector.\n", "  A search is presented for physics beyond the standard model in events with\ntwo opposite-sign, same-flavor leptons, jets and missing transverse momentum in\nthe final state. The search is performed in a dataset of 35.9\n$\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of $\\sqrt{s} = $ 13 TeV pp collisions recorded by the CMS\nexperiment in the year 2016. The search targets models in which a colored\nparticle is produced. Models are considered, in which a kinematic edge is\nobserved in the dilepton invariant mass distribution and models in which a Z\nboson arises in the decay chain of the SUSY particles. Such searches have been\nperformed in 8 TeV pp collisions as well as 13 TeV collisions. This version of\nthe search adds additional event categories as well as improved background\nestimation procedures substantially increasing the sensitivity of the search.\nThe results are interpreted in the context of simplified models of\nSupersymmetry.\n", "  We present late-time follow-up of the relativistic tidal disruption flare\ncandidate Swift J1112.2-8238. We confirm the previously determined redshift of\n$z=0.8900\\pm0.0005$ based on multiple emission line detections. {\\em HST}\nimaging of the host galaxy indicates a complex and distorted morphology with at\nleast two spatially distinct components. These are offset in velocity space by\nless than 350\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ in VLT/X-Shooter observations, suggesting that the\nhost is undergoing interaction with another galaxy. The transient position is\nconsistent to 2.2$\\sigma$ with the centre of a bulge-like component at a\ndistance of 1.1$\\pm$0.5\\,kpc from its centre. Luminous, likely variable radio\nemission has also been observed, strengthening the similarities between Swift\nJ1112.2-8238 and other previously identified relativistic tidal disruption\nflares. While the transient location is $\\sim2\\sigma$ from the host centroid,\nthe disrupted nature of the host may provide an explanation for this. The tidal\ndisruption model remains a good description for these events.\n", "  Although the existence of dark matter is well established by many\nastronomical measurements, its nature still remains one of the unsolved puzzles\nof particles physics. The unprecedented energy reached by the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) at CERN has allowed exploration of previously unaccessible\nkinematic regimes in the search for new phenomena. An overview of most recent\nsearches for dark matter with the ATLAS detector at LHC is presented and the\ninterpretation of the results in terms of effective field theory and simplified\nmodels is discussed. The exclusion limits set by the ATLAS searches are\ncompared to the constraints from direct dark matter detection experiments.\n", "  Many examples of natural systems can be described by random Gaussian\nsurfaces. Much can be learned by analyzing the Fourier expansion of the\nsurfaces, from which it is possible to determine the corresponding Hurst\nexponent and consequently establish the presence of scale invariance. We show\nthat this symmetry is not affected by the distribution of the modulus of the\nFourier coefficients. Furthermore, we investigate the role of the Fourier\nphases of random surfaces. In particular, we show how the surface is affected\nby a non-uniform distribution of phases.\n", "  We present phenomenological predictions at NNLO QCD and NLO EW accuracy for\n$t \\bar t$ distributions at the LHC (8 and 13 TeV). We discuss the impact of\nthe electroweak corrections and quantify the theory errors from scale and PDF\nuncertainties. Moreover, we show the relevance of a precise determination of\nthe photon PDF for $t \\bar t$ distributions.\n", "  We report the results of our spectropolarimetric monitoring of the weak-line\nT-Tauri stars (wTTSs) Par 1379 and Par 2244, within the MaTYSSE (Magnetic\nTopologies of Young Stars and the Survival of close-in giant Exoplanets)\nprogramme. Both stars are of a similar mass (1.6 and 1.8 M$_{\\odot}$) and age\n(1.8 and 1.1 Myr), with Par 1379 hosting an evolved low-mass dusty\ncircumstellar disc, and with Par 2244 showing evidence of a young debris disc.\nWe detect profile distortions and Zeeman signatures in the unpolarized and\ncircularly polarized lines for each star, and have modelled their rotational\nmodulation using tomographic imaging, yielding brightness and magnetic maps. We\nfind that Par 1379 harbours a weak (250 G), mostly poloidal field tilted\n$65^{\\circ}$ from the rotation axis. In contrast, Par 2244 hosts a stronger\nfield (860 G) split 3:2 between poloidal and toroidal components, with most of\nthe energy in higher order modes, and with the poloidal component tilted\n$45^{\\circ}$ from the rotation axis. Compared to the lower mass wTTSs, V819 Tau\nand V830 Tau, Par 2244 has a similar field strength, but is much more complex,\nwhereas the much less complex field of Par 1379 is also much weaker than any\nother mapped wTTS. We find moderate surface differential rotation of\n$1.4\\times$ and $1.8\\times$ smaller than Solar, for Par 1379 and Par 2244,\nrespectively. Using our tomographic maps to predict the activity related radial\nvelocity (RV) jitter, and filter it from the RV curves, we find RV residuals\nwith dispersions of 0.017 kms$^{-1}$ and 0.086 kms$^{-1}$ for Par 1379 and Par\n2244, respectively. We find no evidence for close-in giant planets around\neither star, with $3\\sigma$ upper limits of 0.56 and 3.54 M$_{\\text{jup}}$ (at\nan orbital distance of 0.1 au).\n", "  Measurements of single boson production cross sections are presented. They\nare based on proton-proton collision data at 8 and 13 TeV recorded with the CMS\ndetector at the LHC. Inclusive and differential cross sections with respect to\nvarious observables are measured in various phase spaces. These measurements\nare compared to perturbative QCD predictions and generally show good agreement\nwith the prediction.\n", "  We motivate and explore the basic features of generalized contagion, a model\nmechanism that unifies fundamental models of biological and social contagion.\nGeneralized contagion builds on the elementary observation that spreading and\ncontagion of all kinds involve some form of system memory. We discuss the three\nmain classes of systems that generalized contagion affords, resembling: simple\nbiological contagion; critical mass contagion of social phenomena; and an\nintermediate, and explosive, vanishing critical mass contagion. We also present\na simple explanation of the global spreading condition in the context of a\nsmall seed of infected individuals.\n", "  We study multi-frequency quasiperiodic Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators on\n$\\mathbb{Z} $. We prove that for a large real analytic potential satisfying\ncertain restrictions the spectrum consists of a single interval. The result is\na consequence of a criterion for the spectrum to contain an interval at a given\nlocation that we establish non-perturbatively in the regime of positive\nLyapunov exponent.\n", "  Searches for direct electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos in\nsignatures with two light leptons of the same charge and with three or more\nleptons including up to two hadronically decaying {\\tau} leptons are presented\n. The full 2016 dataset of pp collisions recorded by CMS at a center-of-mass\nenergy of 13 TeV is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9\n/fb. The observed event rates are in agreement with expectations from the\nstandard model. These results probe charginos and neutralinos with masses up to\nvalues between 225 and 1150 GeV, depending on the model parameters assumed.\n", "  A Fourier-type integral representation for Bessel's function of the first\nkind and complex order is obtained by using the Gegenbuaer extension of\nPoisson's integral representation for the Bessel function along with a\ntrigonometric integral representation of Gegenbauer's polynomials. This\nrepresentation lets us express various functions related to the incomplete\ngamma function in series of Bessel's functions. Neumann series of Bessel\nfunctions are also considered and a new closed-form integral representation for\nthis class of series is given. The density function of this representation is\nsimply the analytic function on the unit circle associated with the sequence of\ncoefficients of the Neumann series. Examples of new closed-form integral\nrepresentations of special functions are also presented.\n", "  Nonlinear response coefficients of higher-order anisotropy harmonics for\ncharged particles are measured in PbPb collisions at 2.76 and 5.02 TeV as a\nfunction of transverse momentum and collision centrality. The nonlinear\nresponse coefficients are obtained from $v_{n}$ harmonics measured with respect\nto their own plane and the mixed harmonics. Additionally, at 5.02 TeV PbPb\ncollisions, a significant negative skewness is observed by a fine splitting\nbetween $v_{2}\\{4\\}$ and $v_{2}\\{6\\}$ cumulants. The elliptic flow skewness is\nmeasured up to 60\\% centrality. The results are compared with hydrodynamic\nmodels with different shear viscosity to entropy density ratios and initial\nconditions.\n", "  It is generally assumed that fluorescence radiation does not play a\nsignificant role in the performance of Cherenkov telescopes. However, this\nassumption is required to be verified using detailed Monte Carlo simulations.\nIn order to do this, we have implemented the production and tracking of\nfluorescence radiation inside the CORSIKA code, and simulated gamma-ray induced\nshowers in the very high energy range. The most accurate fluorescence-yield\ndata available so far was used for this purpose.\n  The distribution of both light components on the ground has been studied as a\nfunction of various parameters affecting the detection and reconstruction of\ngamma-ray showers such as the angular aperture. From these distributions, we\ndetermined the conditions under which fluorescence radiation becomes\nsignificant. These results will also be useful to estimate the corresponding\nsystematic errors in Cherenkov telescope observations. The full simulation\nresults have been cross-checked, on a small sample of events, against numerical\ncalculations based on a one-dimension shower profile and found to be compatible\nwith each other. Both tools can be used for further investigations, like\nstudying the possibility to modify Cherenkov telescopes for the measurement of\nfluorescence induced by extensive air showers.\n", "  Relation between global transition function and local transition function of\na homogeneous one dimensional cellular automaton (CA) is investigated for some\nstandard transition functions. It could be shown that left shift and right\nshift CA are invertible. The final result of this paper states that the set of\nall left and right shift CA together with the identity CA on the same set forms\nan abelian group.\n", "  We investigate the Schwinger effect for the gauge bosons in an unbroken\nnon-Abelian gauge theory (e.g. the gluons of QCD). We consider both constant\n\"color electric\" fields and \"color magnetic\" fields as backgrounds. As in the\nAbelian Schwinger effect we find there is production of \"gluons\" for the color\nelectric field, but no particle production for the color magnetic field case.\nSince the non-Abelian gauge bosons are massless there is no exponential\nsuppression of particle production due to the mass of the electron/positron\nthat one finds in the Abelian Schwinger effect. Despite the lack of an\nexponential suppression of the gluon production rate due to the masslessness of\nthe gluons, we find that the critical field strength is even larger in the\nnon-Abelian case as compared to the Abelian case. This is the result of the\nconfinement phenomenon on QCD.\n", "  We report on stacked multiple quantum dots (QDs) formed inside inverted\npyramidal recesses, which allow for the precise positioning of the QDs\nthemselves. Specifically we fabricated double QDs with varying inter-dot\ndistance and ensembles with more than two nominally highly symmetric QDs. For\neach, the effect of the interaction between QDs is studied by characterizing a\nlarge number of QDs through photoluminescence spectroscopy. A clear red-shift\nof the emission energy is observed together with a change in the orientation of\nits polarization, suggesting an increasing interaction between the QDs. Finally\nwe show how stacked QDs can help influencing the charging of the excitonic\ncomplexes.\n", "  We present a new implementation of photoproduction processes in e+e- and ep\ncollisions into Pythia 8 Monte-Carlo event-generator. In particular we discuss\nhow the parton showers and multiparton interactions are generated with a\nresolved photon beam and what is the relative contribution from direct\nprocesses in different kinematical regions. As an application we show\ncomparisons to data for charged-particle production in e+e- and ep collisions\nat LEP and HERA. We consider also photoproduction of dijets comparing to data\nfor ep collisions at HERA and discuss about possibility to further constrain\nnuclear PDFs with ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.\n", "  Review of the third edition of \"Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio\nAstronomy\" by Thompson, Moran and Swenson\n", "  This activity has been developed as a resource for the \"EU Space Awareness\"\neducational programme. As part of the suite \"Our Fragile Planet\" together with\nthe \"Climate Box\" it addresses aspects of weather phenomena, the Earth's\nclimate and climate change as well as Earth observation efforts like in the\nEuropean \"Copernicus\" programme. This activity uses a simple analogue for the\npower of radiation received at a given distance from a star. A photovoltaic\ncell is connected to an electric motor. Depending on the power received on the\ncell, the motor begins to move. It changes also its speed with respect to the\ndistance between the cell and the lamp. This can be interpreted as a model for\na planetary system and its habitable zone. The \"engine of life\" moves as soon\nas the receiving power is big enough to sustain its operation. The distance,\nwhere the motor stops, can be interpreted as the outer edge of the habitable\nzone. As a second activity, the students will reconstruct the orbits of a real\nexoplanetary system by drawing a scaled model. In addition, they will calculate\nand superimpose a realistic circumstellar habitable zone and discuss its\nelements.\n", "  Routh reduction for Lagrangian systems with cyclic variable is presented as\nan example of Lagrangian reduction. It appears that Routhian, which is a\ngenerating object of reduced dynamics, is not a function any more but a section\nof a bundle of affine values.\n", "  We discuss some recent achievements in our understanding of the local AGN\npopulation based on large-area hard X-ray surveys (in particular, by the IBIS\ninstrument aboard INTEGRAL), focusing on the issue of the fraction of obscured\nAGN as a function of hard X-ray luminosity.\n", "  Soft QCD and double parton scattering are of great interest in high energy\nphysics. They are both actively studied at the LHCb experiment. The measurement\nof the central exclusive production of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$ mesons in $pp$\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13 \\,{\\mathrm{TeV}}$ is presented. The result shows\ngood agreement with the theoretical predictions. The measurement of the\n$J/\\psi$ pair production cross-section in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13\n\\,{\\mathrm{TeV}}$ is reported. The differential cross-sections as functions of\nvarious kinematic variables are compared to the theoretical predictions, and\nshow significant evidence of double parton scattering contribution.\n", "  The Astronomical Roentgen Telescope X-ray Concentrator (ART-XC) is a hard\nX-ray telescope with energy response up to 30 keV, to be launched on board the\nSpectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) spacecraft in 2018. ART-XC consists of seven\nidentical co-aligned mirror modules. Each mirror assembly is coupled with a\nCdTe double-sided strip (DSS) focal-plane detector. Eight X-ray mirror modules\n(seven flight and one spare units) for ART-XC were developed and fabricated at\nthe Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), NASA, USA. We present results of\ntesting procedures performed with an X-ray beam facility at MSFC to calibrate\nthe point spread function (PSF) of the mirror modules. The shape of the PSF was\nmeasured with a high-resolution CCD camera installed in the focal plane with\ndefocusing of 7 mm, as required by the ART-XC design. For each module, we\nperformed a parametrization of the PSF at various angular distances Theta. We\nused a King function to approximate the radial profile of the near on-axis PSF\n(Theta<9 arcmin) and an ellipse fitting procedure to describe the morphology of\nthe far off-axis angular response (9<Theta<24 arcmin). We found a good\nagreement between the seven ART-XC flight mirror modules at the level of 10%.\nThe on-axis angular resolution of the ART-XC optics varies between 27 and 33\narcsec (half-power diameter), except for the spare module.\n", "  The NuSTAR mission performed a long (200 ks) observation of the Arches\nstellar cluster in 2015. The emission from the cluster represents a mixture of\nbright thermal (kT~2 keV) X-rays and the extended non-thermal radiation of the\nmolecular cloud around the cluster. In this work we describe the method used to\ndecouple spatially confused emission of the stellar cluster and the molecular\ncloud in the NuSTAR data.\n", "  Phycobilisomes, the light-harvesting antennas of cyanobacteria, can adapt to\na wide range of environments thanks to a composition and function response to\nstress conditions. We study how structural changes influence excitation\ntransfer in these super-complexes. Specifically, we show the influence of the\nrod length on the photon absorption and subsequent excitation transport to the\ncore. Despite the fact that the efficiency of individual disks on the rod\ndecreases with increasing rod length, we find an optimal length for which the\naverage rod efficiency is maximal. Combining this study with experimental\nstructural measurements, we propose models for the arrangement of the\nphycobiliproteins inside the thylakoid membranes, evaluate the importance of\nrod length, and predict the corresponding transport properties for different\ncyanobacterial species. This analysis, which links the functional and\nstructural properties of full phycobilisome complexes, thus provides further\nrationals to help resolving their exact structure.\n", "  High-precision measurements of the Drell-Yan production provide information\non different aspects contributing to the process, such as parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs), and comparisons with the current precision reached\ntheoretically on the calculations of the cross sections of such processes. This\ndocument describes ATLAS measurements, performed at different centre-of-mass\nenergies, of vector boson (W and Z) cross sections and cross-section ratios. It\nalso discusses measurements of ratios of Z-boson and top-quark pair production\ncross sections, which provide important information on the proton PDFs.\n", "  In a bent crystal the $P$-odd effect of short-lived baryon spin rotation\ncould imitate spin rotation caused by assumed EDM. Use of different behavior of\n$P$-odd and $T$-odd spin rotations at crystal turning around the direction of\nparticle momentum makes it possible to exclude $P$-odd rotation contribution,\nwhen measuring short-lived baryons EDM. Subtraction of the measurement results\nfor angle ranges $\\varphi$ and $\\varphi + \\pi$ from each other enables\nmeasuring $T$-odd rotation at scattering of negatively charged beauty and\nneutral baryons by axes of unbent crystal.\n", "  We demonstrate that a broad class of excited state variational principles is\nnot size consistent. In light of this difficulty, we develop and test an\napproach to excited state optimization that transforms between variational\nprinciples in order to achieve state selectivity, size consistency, and\ncompatibility with quantum Monte Carlo. To complement our formal analysis, we\nprovide numerical examples that confirm these properties and demonstrate how\nthey contribute to a more black box approach to excited states in quantum Monte\nCarlo.\n", "  A set of selected electroweak measurements from the LHC experiments is\ndiscussed. Results on forward-backward asymmetry in production of the Drell-Yan\nevents in both dielectron and dimuon decay channels are presented together with\nresults on the effective mixing angle measurements.\n  Angular coefficients measured in the Z boson production are compared with\ntheoretical predictions. Electroweak production of the vector bosons in\nassociation with two jets is presented.\n", "  We consider locally thermal states (for two qubits) with certain amount of\nquantum entanglement present between them. Unlike previous protocols we show\nhow work can be extracted by performing local unitary operations on this state\nby allowing those two qubits to interact with thermal baths of different\ntemperatures, thereby gradually removing the entanglement between them till\nthey reach a direct product state. Also we demonstrate that, further work can\nbe extracted from this direct product state by performing global unitary\noperation, thereby establishing that work can be extracted from a system\ncomposed of locally thermal subsystems even after removing quantum correlations\nbetween them if the subsystems are thermalized at different temperatures. Also\nwe show that even if we consider a initial state where there is no entanglement\nbetween the two qubits, we can also extract work locally using our method.\n", "  We performed effective mass measurements employing microwave-induced\nresistance oscillation in a tunable-density GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. Our main\nresult is a clear observation of an effective mass increase with decreasing\ndensity, in general agreement with earlier studies which investigated the\ndensity dependence of the effective mass employing Shubnikov- de Haas\noscillations. This finding provides further evidence that microwave-induced\nresistance oscillations are sensitive to electron-electron interactions and\noffer a convenient and accurate way to obtain the effective mass.\n", "  We report on nonlinear transport measurements in a two-dimensional electron\ngas hosted in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. Upon application of direct current,\nthe low-temperature differential resistivity acquires a positive correction,\nwhich exhibits a pronounced maximum followed by a plateau. With increasing\ntemperature, the nonlinearity diminishes and disappears. These observations can\nbe understood in terms of a crossover from the Bloch-Gr\\\"uneisen regime to the\nquasielastic scattering regime as the electrons are heated by direct current.\nCalculations considering the interaction of electrons with acoustic phonons\nprovide a reasonable description of our experimental findings.\n", "  We examine the constraints that future lepton colliders would impose on the\neffective field theory describing modifications of top-quark interactions\nbeyond the standard model, through measurements of the $e^+e^-\\to bW^+\\:\\bar\nbW^-$ process. Statistically optimal observables are exploited to constrain\nsimultaneously and efficiently all relevant operators. Their constraining power\nis sufficient for quadratic effective-field-theory contributions to have\nnegligible impact on limits which are therefore basis independent. This is\ncontrasted with the measurements of cross sections and forward-backward\nasymmetries. An overall measure of constraints strength, the global determinant\nparameter, is used to determine which run parameters impose the strongest\nrestriction on the multidimensional effective-field-theory parameter space.\n", "  In this talk we present a selection of forward physics results recently\nobtained with the run-1 and run-2 LHC data by the CMS, LHCf and TOTEM\nexperiments. The status of the very forward LHC proton spectrometer, CT-PPS, is\ndiscussed: emphasis is given to the physics potential of CT-PPS and to the\nanalyses that are currently ongoing with the data collected in 2016. Very\nrecent forward measurements obtained with the LHCf and the CMS-CASTOR\ncalorimeter are then addressed. In particular, CMS measured the inclusive\nenergy spectrum in the very forward direction for proton-proton collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and the jet cross sections for p+Pb collisions\nat 5.02 TeV. The LHCf experiment has instead recently published the inclusive\nenergy spectra of forward photons for pp collisions at 13 TeV. Finally, the new\nmeasurements of the total, elastic and inelastic cross sections obtained by the\nTOTEM collaboration at 2.76 and 13 TeV center of mass energy are presented.\n", "  A measurement of direct photon production in Pb+Pb collisions at 158 AGeV has\nbeen carried out in the CERN WA98 experiment. The invariant yield of direct\nphotons in central collisions is extracted as a function of transverse momentum\nin the interval 0.5 < pT < 4 GeV/c. A significant direct photon signal,\ncompared to statistical and systematical errors, is seen at pT > 1.5 GeV/c. The\nresults constitute the first observation of direct photons in ultrarelativistic\nheavy-ion collisions which could be significant for diagnosis of quark gluon\nplasma formation.\n"]}
