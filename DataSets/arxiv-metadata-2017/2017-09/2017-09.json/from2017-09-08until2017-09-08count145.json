This is illustrated using a toy model of scattering with two coupled\nchannels. A Bethe-Salpeter amplitude is constructed which is a mixture of the\nwaves in the two channels. The potential derived from this has a strong\nrepulsive core, which arises from the admixture of the closed channel in the\nwave function and not from the dynamics of the model.\n", "  The very small braking index of PSR J1734-3333, $n=0.9\\pm0.2$, challenges the\ncurrent theories of braking mechanisms in pulsars. We present a possible\ninterpretation that this pulsar is surrounded by a fall-back disk and braked by\nit. A modified braking torque is proposed based on the competition between the\nmagnetic energy density of a pulsar and the kinetic energy density of a\nfall-back disk. With this torque, a self-similar disk can fit all the observed\nparameters of PSR J1734-3333 with natural initial parameters. In this regime,\nthe star will evolve to the region having anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft\ngamma repeaters in the $P-\\dot{P}$ diagram in about 20000 years and stay there\nfor a very long time. The mass of the disk around PSR J1734-3333 in our model\nis about $10M_{\\oplus}$, similar to the observed mass of the disk around AXP 4U\n0142+61.\n", "  We advocate and develop the use of the dreibein (and the metric) as\nprepotential for three-dimensional SO(3) Yang-Mills theory. Since the dreibein\ntransforms homogeneously under gauge transformation, the metric is gauge\ninvariant. For a generic gauge potential, there is a unique dreibein on fixing\nthe boundary condition. Topologically non-trivial monopole configurations are\ngiven by conformally flat metrics, with scalar fields capturing the monopole\ncentres. Our approach also provides an ansatz for the gauge potential covering\nthe topological aspects.\n", "  The properties of the coinless quantum walk model have not been as thoroughly\nanalyzed as those of the coined model. Both evolve in discrete time steps but\nthe former uses a smaller Hilbert space, which is spanned merely by the site\nbasis. Besides, the evolution operator can be obtained using a process of\nlattice tessellation, which is very appealing. The moments of the probability\ndistribution play an important role in the context of quantum walks. The\nballistic behavior of the mean square displacement indicates that\nquantum-walk-based algorithms are faster than random-walk-based ones. In this\npaper, we obtain analytical expressions for the moments of the coinless model\non $d$-dimensional lattices. The mean square displacement for large times is\nexplicitly calculated for the one- and two-dimensional lattices and, using\noptimization methods, the parameter values that give the largest spread are\ncalculated and compared with the equivalent ones of the coined model. Although\nwe have employed asymptotic methods, our approximations are accurate even for\nsmall numbers of time steps.\n", "  We propose an action for the extended sigma - models in the most general\nsetting of the kinetic term allowed in the nontrivially deformed field -\nantifield formalism. We show that the classical motion equations do naturally\ntake their desired canonical form.\n", "  Resources and their use and consumption form a central part of our life. Many\nbranches of science and engineering are concerned with the question of which\ngiven resource objects can be converted into which target resource objects. For\nexample, information theory studies the conversion of a noisy communication\nchannel instance into an exchange of information. Inspired by work in quantum\ninformation theory, we develop a general mathematical toolbox for this type of\nquestion. The convertibility of resources into other ones and the possibility\nof combining resources is accurately captured by the mathematics of ordered\ncommutative monoids. As an intuitive example, we consider chemistry, where\nchemical reaction equations such as \\[ \\mathrm{2H_2 + O_2} \\to \\mathrm{2H_2O}\n\\] are concerned both with a convertibility relation \"$\\to$\" and a combination\noperation \"$+$\". We study ordered commutative monoids from an algebraic and\nfunctional-analytic perspective and derive a wealth of results which should\nhave applications to concrete resource theories, such as a formula for rates of\nconversion. As a running example showing that ordered commutative monoids are\nalso of purely mathematical interest, we exemplify our results with the ordered\ncommutative monoid of graphs.\n  While closely related to both Girard's linear logic and to Deutsch's\nconstructor theory, our framework also produces results very reminiscent of the\nutility theorem of von Neumann and Morgenstern in decision theory and of a\ntheorem of Lieb and Yngvason on thermodynamics.\n  Concerning pure algebra, our observation is that some pieces of algebra can\nbe developed in a context in which equality is not necessarily symmetric, i.e.\nin which the equality relation is replaced by an ordering relation. For\nexample, notions like cancellativity or torsion-freeness are still sensible and\nvery natural concepts in our ordered setting.\n", "  We investigate a class of \"shape allophiles\" that fit together like puzzle\npieces as a method to access and stabilize desired structures by controlling\ndirectional entropic forces. Squares are cut into rectangular halves, which are\nshaped in an allophilic manner with the goal of re-assembling the squares while\nself-assembling the square lattice. We examine the assembly characteristics of\nthis system via the potential of mean force and torque, and the fraction of\nparticles that entropically bind. We generalize our findings and apply them to\nself-assemble triangles into a square lattice via allophilic shaping. Through\nthese studies we show how shape allophiles can be useful in assembling and\nstabilizing desired phases with appropriate allophilic design.\n", "  A comprehensive understanding of spin-polarized photoemission is crucial for\naccessing the electronic structure of spin-orbit coupled materials. Yet, the\nimpact of the final state in the photoemission process on the photoelectron\nspin has been difficult to assess in these systems. We present experiments for\nthe spin-orbit split states in a Bi-Ag surface alloy showing that the\nalteration of the final state with energy may cause a complete reversal of the\nphotoelectron spin polarization. We explain the effect on the basis of ab\ninitio one-step photoemission theory and describe how it originates from linear\ndichroism in the angular distribution of photoelectrons. Our analysis shows\nthat the modulated photoelectron spin polarization reflects the intrinsic spin\ndensity of the surface state being sampled differently depending on the final\nstate, and it indicates linear dichroism as a natural probe of spin-orbit\ncoupling at surfaces.\n", "  In this short communication, we highlight the deficiencies within the\ncontemporary angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) implementations\nand point out few remedies towards their resolution. These deficiencies\nprohibit the current version of the ARPES technique from revealing the\nmany-body physics of solids in its entirety. It is believed that the origin of\nthese deficiencies lie within the prevailing data acquisition methods used for\nregistering information from the photoelectron. It is argued that a slight\nchange in the data acquisition methods would remedy the situation.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate imaginary part of the potential for a moving\nquarkonia in plasma. In order to verify the validity of imaginary part of the\npotential we employ hyperscaling violation metric background. In QCD system the\nimaginary part of potential shows the decay behaviour and the corresponding\npotential should be negative. The corresponding potential always appears in QCD\nas an exponential function. We find general constraints for Im$V_{Q\\bar{Q}}$ at\nthe near horizon limit and apply them for some known cases. Finally, we find\nthe suitable spatial dimension d, z and $\\theta$ also rapidity $\\eta$ for two\ninteresting cases. Our calculation with AdS/CFT guarantees the dynamical\nparameter as a $\\theta$ in hyperscaling violation metric background. We also\npresent the hyperscaling violationg metric in this context very close to YM\ntheory with finite temperature.\n", "  Practical quantum computers require the construction of a large network of\nhighly coherent qubits, interconnected in a design robust against errors. Donor\nspins in silicon provide state-of-the-art coherence and quantum gate\nfidelities, in a physical platform adapted from industrial semiconductor\nprocessing. Here we present a scalable design for a silicon quantum processor\nthat does not require precise donor placement and allows hundreds of nanometers\ninter-qubit distances, therefore facilitating fabrication using current\ntechnology. All qubit operations are performed via electrical means on the\nelectron-nuclear spin states of a phosphorus donor. Single-qubit gates use low\npower electric drive at microwave frequencies, while fast two-qubit gates\nexploit electric dipole-dipole interactions. Microwave resonators allow for\nmillimeter-distance entanglement and interfacing with photonic links. Sweet\nspots protect the qubits from charge noise up to second order, implying that\nall operations can be performed with error rates below quantum error correction\nthresholds, even without any active noise cancellation technique.\n", "  In this article we have studied the propagation of matter waves in Rindler\nspace. We have also developed the formalism to obtained space dependent\nrefractive index for de Broglie waves for the particle and shown the\npossibility of particle emission from the event horizon of classical black\nholes, when observed from a uniformly accelerated frame.\n", "  At the invariant mass spectrum of $h_c\\pi^\\pm$ a new resonance $Z_c(4020)$\nhas been observed, however the previously confirmed $Z_c(3900)$ does not show\nup at this channel. In this paper we assume that $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_c(4020)$\nare molecular states of $D\\bar D^*(D^{*} \\bar D)$ and $D^*\\bar D^*$\nrespectively, then we calculate the transition rates of $Z_c(3900)\\to h_c+\\pi$\nand $Z_c(4020)\\to h_c+\\pi$ in the light front model. Our results show that the\npartial width of $Z_c(3900)\\to h_c+\\pi$ is only three times smaller than that\nof $Z_c(4020)\\to h_c+\\pi$. $Z_c(4020)$ seems to be a molecular state, so if\n$Z_c(3900)$ is also a molecular state it should be observed in the portal\n$e^+e^-\\to h_c\\pi^\\pm$ as long as the database is sufficiently large, by\ncontrary if the future more precise measurements still cannot find $Z_c(3900)$\nat $h_c\\pi^\\pm$ channel, the molecular assignment to $Z_c(3900)$ should be\nruled out.\n", "  We present a simulation-based study for monitoring Akkuyu Nuclear Power\nPlant's activity using antineutrino flux originating from the reactor core. A\nwater Cherenkov detector has been designed and optimization studies have been\nperformed using Geant4 simulation toolkit. A first study for the design of a\nmonitoring detector facility for Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant is discussed in\nthis paper.\n", "  We derive a lower bound to the spectral threshold of the Dirichlet Laplacian\nin tubular neighbourhoods of constant radius about complete surfaces. This\nlower bound is given by the lowest eigenvalue of a one-dimensional operator\ndepending on the radius and principal curvatures of the reference surface.\nMoreover, we show that it is optimal if the reference surface is non-negatively\ncurved.\n", "  Despite the fundamental importance of solid--solid transitions for\nmetallurgy, ceramics, earth science, reconfigurable materials, and colloidal\nmatter, the details of how materials transform between two solid structures are\npoorly understood. We introduce a class of {simple} model systems in which the\ndirect control of local order, via colloid shape change, induces solid--solid\nphase transitions, and characterize how the transitions happen\nthermodynamically. We find that within a single shape family there are\nsolid--solid transitions that can occur with or without a thermal activation\nbarrier. Our results provide new means for the study of solid--solid phase\ntransitions, and have implications for designing reconfigurable materials.\n", "  We present evidence from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations for a\nco-evolution of the slope of the total (dark and stellar) mass density profile,\ngamma_tot, and the dark matter fraction within the half-mass radius, f_DM, in\nearly-type galaxies. The relation can be described as gamma_tot = A f_DM + B\nfor all systems at all redshifts. The trend is set by the decreasing importance\nof gas dissipation towards lower redshifts and for more massive systems.\nEarly-type galaxies are smaller, more concentrated, have lower f_DM and steeper\ngamma_tot at high redshifts and at lower masses for a given redshift; f_DM and\ngamma_tot are good indicators for growth by \"dry\" merging. The values for A and\nB change distinctively for different feedback models, and this relation can be\nused as a test for such models. A similar correlation exists between gamma_tot\nand the stellar mass surface density Sigma_*. A model with weak stellar\nfeedback and feedback from black holes is in best agreement with observations.\nAll simulations, independent of the assumed feedback model, predict steeper\ngamma_tot and lower f_DM at higher redshifts. While the latter is in agreement\nwith the observed trends, the former is in conflict with lensing observations,\nwhich indicate constant or decreasing gamma_tot. This discrepancy is shown to\nbe artificial: the observed trends can be reproduced from the simulations using\nobservational methodology to calculate the total density slopes.\n", "  Interacting random field of probabilities links Kolmogorov law 0-1 and\nBayesian probabilities observing Markov diffusion process under Yes-No actions\nof random impulse. These objective probabilities measure virtual probing\nimpulses processing the interactions in observable process. The impulse\nobservation increases each posteriori correlation reducing conditional entropy\nmeasures from finite uncertainty up to certainty of real impulse. The reduced\nentropy conveys probabilistic causality with time course and temporal memory in\ncollecting correlations, which interactive impulse innately cuts exposing\nhidden process entropy. The natural cut of this entropy reveals information\nhidden in the correlation connections. Inside the merging probing impulse\nemerges reversible microprocess with yes-no conjugated entangled entropy,\ncurvature and logical complexity. Within the impulse time interval,\nentanglement starts before its space is formed and ends with beginning the\nspace during reversible relative time interval being small part of impulse time\ninterval. Merging impulse curves and rotates the impulse interactive actions in\nmicroprocess whose space interval measures this transitive movement.The cutting\nentropy sequentially converting to information memorizes the probes logic in\nBit, participating in next probe conversions and encoding which memorizes\ninformation causality. The complexity and mass appears after the space emerges\nfrom the entanglement.The cognition assembles common units through the multiple\nattraction and resonances at forming network (IN) of triplet hierarchy, which\naccept only units that concentrates and recognizes each triplet IN node. The\nended triplet of hierarchical INs measures level of the observer intelligence.\nThe synthesized optimal process minimizes the observations time in Artificial\ndesigned information Observer with intellectual searching logic.\n", "  A software system has been developed for the DArk Matter Particle Explorer\n(DAMPE) mission, a satellite-based experiment. The DAMPE software is mainly\nwritten in C++ and steered using Python script. This article presents an\noverview of the DAMPE offline software, including the major architecture design\nand specific implementation for simulation, calibration and reconstruction. The\nwhole system has been successfully applied to DAMPE data analysis, based on\nwhich some results from simulation and beam test experiments are obtained and\npresented.\n", "  We develop a moment QCD sum rule method augmented by fundamental inequalities\nto study the existence of exotic doubly hidden-charm/bottom tetraquark states\nmade of four heavy quarks. Using the compact diquark-antidiquark configuration,\nwe calculate the mass spectra of these tetraquark states. There are 18\nhidden-charm $cc\\bar c\\bar c$ tetraquark currents with $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$,\n$0^{-+}$, $0^{--}$, $1^{++}$, $1^{+-}$, $1^{-+}$, $1^{--}$, and $2^{++}$. We\nuse them to perform QCD sum rule analyses, and the obtained masses are all\nhigher than the spontaneous dissociation thresholds of two charmonium mesons,\nwhich are thus their dominant decay modes. The masses of the corresponding\nhidden-bottom $bb\\bar b\\bar b$ tetraquarks are all below or very close to the\nthresholds of the $\\Upsilon(1S)\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\eta_b(1S)\\eta_b(1S)$, except\none current of $J^{PC}=0^{++}$. Hence, we suggest to search for the doubly\nhidden-charm states in the $J/\\psi J/\\psi$ and $\\eta_c(1S)\\eta_c(1S)$ channels.\n", "  Bohr's principle of complementarity, in the context of a two-slit\ninterference experiment, is understood as the quantitative measures of wave and\nparticle natures following a duality relation ${\\mathcal D}^2+{\\mathcal V}^2\n\\le 1$. Here ${\\mathcal D}$ is a measure of distinguishability of the two\npaths, and ${\\mathcal V}$ is the visibility of interference. It is shown that\nsuch a relation can be formulated for $N-$slit or $N-$path interference too,\nwith the proviso that the wave nature is characterized by a measure of {\\em\ncoherence} (${\\mathcal C}$). This new relation, ${\\mathcal D}^2+{\\mathcal C}^2\n\\le 1$ is shown to be tight, and reduces to the known duality relation for the\ncase $N=2$. A recently introduced similar relation (Bagan et al., 2016) is\nshown to be inadequate for the purpose.\n", "  Experimental evidence has pointed toward the existence of ultrafast proton\nmigration and isomerization as a key process for acetylene and its ions,\nhowever the actual mechanism for ultrafast isomerization of the acetylene\n[HCCH]2+ to vinylidene [H2CC]2+ dication remains nebulous. Theoretical studies\nshow a high potential barrier of over 2eV for the isomerization pathways on the\nlow lying dicationic states, implying that the corresponding isomerization\nshould take picoseconds or even longer according to transition state theory.\nHowever a recent experiment at a femtosecond X-ray free electron laser (XFEL)\n[Nature Commun. 6, 8199 (2015)] suggests that large amplitude hydrogen\nmigration proceeds on a sub-100 femtosecond time scale. In order to resolve the\ncontradiction, we present a complete theoretical study of the dynamics of\nacetylene dication produced by Auger decay after X-ray photoionization of the\ncarbon atom K shell. We find that isomerization does not occur on the sub-100\nfs timescale and is not required to explain the time-resolved Coulomb imaging\nexperiment. This study resolves the seeming contradiction between experiment\nand theory concerning the isomerization time scale in acetylene dication. This\nwork calls for careful interpretation of structural information from the widely\napplied Coulomb momentum imaging method but also points out its strengths in\nmapping out momentum dispersion dynamics even when structural variation is\nminor.\n", "  The motion of a self-propelled particle is affected by its surroundings, such\nas boundaries or external fields. In this paper, we investigated the\nbifurcation of the motion of a camphor grain, as a simple actual self-propelled\nsystem, confined in a one-dimensional finite region. A camphor grain exhibits\noscillatory motion or remains at rest around the center position in a\none-dimensional finite water channel, depending on the length of the water\nchannel and the resistance coefficient. A mathematical model including the\nboundary effect is analytically reduced to an ordinary differential equation.\nLinear stability analysis reveals that the Hopf bifurcation occurs, reflecting\nthe symmetry of the system.\n", "  We construct fixed-point wave functions and exactly solvable\ncommuting-projector Hamiltonians for a large class of bosonic symmetry-enriched\ntopological (SET) phases, based on the concept of equivalent classes of\nsymmetric local unitary transformations. We argue that for onsite unitary\nsymmetries, our construction realizes all SETs free of anomaly, as long as the\nunderlying topological order itself can be realized with a commuting-projector\nHamiltonian. We further extend the construction to anti-unitary symmetries\n(e.g. time-reversal symmetry), mirror-reflection symmetries, and to anomalous\nSETs on the surface of three-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases.\nMathematically, our construction naturally leads to a generalization of group\nextensions of unitary fusion categories to anti-unitary symmetries.\n", "  In this article, we propose a general framework to study the dynamics and\ntopology of cellular networks that capture the geometry of cell packings in\ntwo-dimensional tissues. Such epithelia undergo large-scale deformation during\nmorphogenesis of a multicellular organism. Large-scale deformations emerge from\nmany individual cellular events such as cell shape changes, cell\nrearrangements, cell divisions, and cell extrusions. Using a triangle-based\nrepresentation of cellular network geometry, we obtain an exact decomposition\nof large-scale material deformation. Interestingly, our approach reveals\ncontributions of correlations between cellular rotations and elongation as well\nas cellular growth and elongation to tissue deformation. Using this Triangle\nMethod, we discuss tissue remodeling in the developing pupal wing of the fly\nDrosophila melanogaster.\n", "  General expressions for the electron- and hole-acoustical-phonon deformation\npotential Hamiltonian (H_{E-DP}) are derived for the case of Ge/Si and Si/Ge\ncore/shell nanowire structures (NWs) with circular cross section. Based on the\nshort-range elastic continuum approach and on derived analytical results, the\nspatial confined effects on the vector phonon displacement, the phonon\ndispersion relation and the electron- and hole-phonon scattering amplitudes are\nanalyzed. It is shown that the acoustical vector displacement, phonon\nfrequencies and H_{E-DP} present mixed torsional, axial, and radial components\ndepending on the angular momentum quantum number and phonon wavector under\nconsideration. The treatment shows that bulk group velocities of the\nconstituent materials are renormalized due to the spatial confinement and\nintrinsic strain at the interface. The role of insulating shell on the phonon\ndispersion and electron-phonon coupling in Ge/Si and Si/Ge NWs are discussed.\n", "  Two thought experiments are analyzed, revealing that the quantum state of the\nuniverse does not contain definitive evidence of the wavefunction collapse. The\nfirst thought experiment shows that unitary quantum evolution alone can account\nfor the outcomes of any combination of quantum experiments. This is in\ncontradiction with the standard view on quantum measurement, which appeals to\nthe wavefunction collapse, but it is in full agreement with the special state\nproposal (L.S. Schulman in Phys Lett A 102(9):396-400, 1984; J Stat Phys\n42(3):689-719 1986; Time's arrows and quantum measurement, Cambridge University\nPress, Cambridge 1997) that there are some rare states that account for quantum\nexperiments by unitary evolution alone. The second thought experiment consists\nin successive measurements, and reveals that the standard quantum measurement\nscheme predicts violations of the conservation laws. It is shown that the\nstandard view on quantum measurements makes some unnecessary assumptions which\nlead to the apparent necessity to invoke wavefunction collapse. Once these\nassumptions are removed, a new hope of a measurement scheme emerges, which,\nwhile still having open problems, is compatible with both the unitary evolution\nand the conservation laws, and suggests means to experimentally distinguish\nbetween full unitarity and discontinuous collapse.\n", "  We study the role of the lattice artifacts associated with the Coulomb\nbinding effects in the analysis of the heavy quarkonium within lattice NRQCD.\nWe find that a \"naive\" perturbative matching generates spurious linear Coulomb\nartifacts, which result in a large systematic error in the lattice predictions\nfor the heavy quarkonium spectrum. This effect is responsible, in particular,\nfor the discrepancy between the recent determinations of the bottomonium\nhyperfine splitting in the radiatively improved lattice NRQCD [1, 2]. We show\nthat the correct matching procedure which provides full control over\ndiscretization errors is based on the asymptotic expansion of the lattice\ntheory about the continuum limit, which gives\n$M_{\\Upsilon(1S)}-M_{\\eta_b(1S)}=52.9\\pm 5.5~{\\rm MeV}$ [1].\n", "  We study systems of three bosons bound by a long-range interaction\nsupplemented by a short-range potential of variable strength. This generalizes\nthe usual two-body exotic atoms where the Coulomb interaction is modified by\nnuclear forces at short distances. The energy shift due to the short-range part\nof the interaction combines two-body terms similar to the ones entering the\nTrueman-Deser formula, and three-body contributions. A sudden variation of the\nenergy levels is observed near the coupling thresholds of the short-range\npotential. But the patterns of rearrangement are significantly modified as\ncompared to the two-body case.\n", "  Engineered quantum systems allow us to observe phenomena that are not easily\naccessible naturally. The LEGO-like nature of superconducting circuits makes\nthem particularly suited for building and coupling artificial atoms. Here, we\nintroduce an artificial molecule, composed of two strongly coupled fluxonium\natoms, which possesses a tunable magnetic moment. Using an applied external\nflux, one can tune the molecule between two regimes: one in which the\nground-excited state manifold has a magnetic dipole moment and one in which the\nground-excited state manifold has only a magnetic quadrupole moment. By varying\nthe applied external flux, we find the coherence of the molecule to be limited\nby local flux noise. The ability to engineer and control artificial molecules\npaves the way for building more complex circuits for protected qubits and\nquantum simulation.\n", "  Open quantum systems are often represented by non-Hermitian effective\nHamiltonians that have complex eigenvalues associated with resonances. In\nprevious work we showed that the evolution of tight-binding open systems can be\nrepresented by an explicitly time-reversal symmetric expansion involving all\nthe discrete eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian. These eigenstates\ninclude complex-conjugate pairs of resonant and anti-resonant states. An\ninitially time-reversal-symmetric state contains equal contributions from the\nresonant and anti-resonant states. Here we show that as the state evolves in\ntime, the symmetry between the resonant and anti-resonant states is\nautomatically broken, with resonant states becoming dominant for $t>0$ and\nanti-resonant states becoming dominant for $t<0$. Further, we show that there\nis a time-scale for this symmetry-breaking, which we associate with the \"Zeno\ntime.\" We also compare the time-reversal symmetric expansion with an asymmetric\nexpansion used previously by several researchers. We show how the present\ntime-reversal symmetric expansion bypasses the non-Hilbert nature of the\nresonant and anti-resonant states, which previously introduced exponential\ndivergences into the asymmetric expansion.\n", "  Proposed as a fundamental symmetry describing our universe, spacetime\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) has not been discovered yet in nature. Nonetheless, it has\nbeen predicted that SUSY may emerge in low-energy physics of quantum materials\nsuch as topological superconductors and Weyl semimetals. Here, by performing\nstate-of-the-art sign-problem-free Majorana quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)\nsimulations of an interacting 2D topological superconductor, we show convincing\nevidences that the N=1 SUSY emerges at its edge quantum critical point (EQCP)\nwhile its bulk remains gapped and topologically nontrivial. Remarkably, near\nthe EQCP, we find that the edge Majorana fermion acquires a mass which is\nidentical with that of its bosonic superpartner. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first observation that fermions and bosons have equal\ndynamically-generated masses, a hallmark of emergent SUSY. We further discuss\nexperimental signatures of such EQCP and the associated edge SUSY.\n", "  We define and enumerate two new two-parameter permutation families, namely,\nplacements of a maximum number of non-attacking rooks on $k$ chained-together\n$n\\times n$ chessboards, in either a circular or linear configuration. The\nlinear case with $k=1$ corresponds to standard permutations of $n$, and the\ncircular case with $n=4$ and $k=6$ corresponds to a three-person chessboard. We\ngive bijections of these rook placements to matrix form, one-line notation, and\nmatchings on certain graphs. Finally, we define chained linear and circular\nalternating sign matrices, enumerate them for certain values of $n$ and $k$,\nand give bijections to analogues of monotone triangles, square ice\nconfigurations, and fully-packed loop configurations.\n", "  Several recent works suggested the possibility of describing inflation by\nmeans of a renormalization group equation. In this paper we discuss the\napplication of these methods to models of quintessence. In this framework a\nperiod of exponential expansion corresponds to the slow evolution of the scalar\nfield in the neighborhood of a fixed point. A minimal set of universality\nclasses for models of quintessence is defined and the transition from a matter\ndominated to quintessence dominated universe is studied. Models in which\nquintessence is non-minimally coupled with gravity are also discussed. We show\nthat the formalism proves to be extremely convenient to describe quintessence\nand moreover we find that in most of the models discussed in this work\nquintessence naturally takes over ordinary matter.\n", "  Building on the discussion in PRA 93, 042510 (2016), we present a systematic\nderivation of gradient corrections to the kinetic-energy functional and the\none-particle density, in particular for two-dimensional systems. We derive the\nleading gradient corrections from a semiclassical expansion based on Wigner's\nphase space formalism and demonstrate that the semiclassical kinetic-energy\ndensity functional at zero temperature cannot be evaluated unambiguously. In\ncontrast, a density-potential functional description that effectively\nincorporates interactions provides unambiguous gradient corrections. Employing\nan averaging procedure that involves Airy functions, thereby partially\nresumming higher-order gradient corrections, we facilitate a smooth transition\nof the particle density into the classically forbidden region of arbitrary\nsmooth potentials. We find excellent agreement of the semiclassical\nAiry-averaged particle densities with the exact densities for very low but\nfinite temperatures, illustrated for a Fermi gas with harmonic potential\nenergy. We furthermore provide criteria for the applicability of the\nsemiclassical expansions at low temperatures. Finally, we derive a well-behaved\nground-state kinetic-energy functional, which improves on the Thomas-Fermi\napproximation.\n", "  We analyse the power spectrum of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey\n(BOSS), Data Release 12 (DR12) to constrain the relative velocity effect, which\nrepresents a potential systematic for measurements of the Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) scale. The relative velocity effect is sourced by the\ndifferent evolution of baryon and cold dark matter perturbations before\ndecoupling. Our power spectrum model includes all $1$-loop redshift-space terms\ncorresponding to $v_{\\rm bc}$ parameterised by the bias parameter $b_{v^2}$. We\nalso include the linear terms proportional to the relative density,\n$\\delta_{\\rm bc}$, and relative velocity dispersion, $\\theta_{\\rm bc}$, which\nwe parameterise with the bias parameters $b^{\\rm bc}_{\\delta}$ and $b^{\\rm\nbc}_{\\theta}$. Our data does not support a detection of the relative velocity\neffect in any of these parameters. Combining the low and high redshift bins of\nBOSS, we find limits of $b_{v^2} = 0.012 \\pm 0.015\\;(\\pm 0.031)$, $b^{\\rm\nbc}_{\\delta} = -1.0 \\pm 2.5\\;(\\pm 6.2)$ and $b^{\\rm bc}_{\\theta} = -114 \\pm\n55\\;(\\pm 175)$ with $68\\%$ ($95\\%$) confidence levels. These constraints\nrestrict the potential systematic shift in $D_A(z)$, $H(z)$ and $f\\sigma_8$,\ndue to the relative velocity, to $1\\%$, $0.8\\%$ and $2\\%$, respectively. Given\nthe current uncertainties on the BAO measurements of BOSS these shifts\ncorrespond to $0.53\\sigma$, $0.5\\sigma$ and $0.22\\sigma$ for $D_A(z)$, $H(z)$\nand $f\\sigma_8$, respectively.\n", "  Recently, several exotic bosons have been confirmed as multi-quark states,\nbut there are violent disputes about their inner structures, namely if they are\nmolecular states or tetraquarks, or even mixtures of the two structures. It\nwould be interesting to experimentally search for non-strange four-quark states\nwith open charm or bottom which are lighter than $\\Lambda_c$ or $\\Lambda_b$.\nReasonable arguments indicate that they are good candidates of pure molecular\nstates $D\\pi$ or $B\\pi$ because pions are the lightest boson. Both $B\\pi$ and\n$D\\pi$ bound states do not decay via strong interaction. The $B\\pi$ molecule\nmay decay into $B^*$ by radiating a photon, whereas $D\\pi$ molecule can only\ndecay via weak interaction. In this paper we explore the mass spectra of $B\\pi$\nmolecular statesby solving the corresponding B-S equation. Then the rate of\nradiative decay $|\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\rangle\\to B^*\\gamma$ is calculated\nand our numerical results indicate that the processes can be measured by the\nfuture experiment. We also briefly discuss the $D\\pi$ case, due to the\nconstraint of the final state phase space, it can only decay via weak\ninteraction.\n", "  We investigate ground- and excited-state properties of the deformed Fredkin\nspin chain proposed by Salberger, Zhang, Klich, Korepin, and the authors. This\nmodel is a one-parameter deformation of the Fredkin spin chain, whose\nHamiltonian is $3$-local and translationally invariant in the bulk. The model\nis frustration-free and its unique ground state can be expressed as a weighted\nsuperposition of colored Dyck paths. We focus on the case where the deformation\nparameter $t>1$. By using a variational method, we prove that the finite-size\ngap decays at least exponentially with increasing the system size. We prove\nthat the magnetization in the ground state is along the $z$-direction, namely\n$\\langle s^x \\rangle =\\langle s^y \\rangle=0$, and show that the $z$-component\n$\\langle s^z \\rangle$ exhibits a domain-wall structure. We then study the\nentanglement properties of the chain. In particular, we derive upper and lower\nbounds for the von Neumann and R\\'enyi entropies, and entanglement spectrum for\nany bipartition of the chain.\n", "  The potential importance of short-distance nuclear effects in double-$\\beta$\ndecay is assessed using a lattice QCD calculation of the $nn\\rightarrow pp$\ntransition and effective field theory methods. At the unphysical quark masses\nused in the numerical computation, these effects, encoded in the isotensor\naxial polarisability, are found to be of similar magnitude to the nuclear\nmodification of the single axial current, which phenomenologically is the\nquenching of the axial charge used in nuclear many-body calculations. This\nfinding suggests that nuclear models for neutrinoful and neutrinoless\ndouble-$\\beta$ decays should incorporate this previously neglected contribution\nif they are to provide reliable guidance for next-generation neutrinoless\ndouble-$\\beta$ decay searches. The prospects of constraining the isotensor\naxial polarisabilities of nuclei using lattice QCD input into nuclear many-body\ncalculations are discussed.\n", "  Using measurements from the Cassini spacecraft in Saturn's magnetosphere, we\npropose a 3D physical picture of a corotating reconnection site, which can only\nbe driven by an internally generated source. Our results demonstrate that the\ncorotating magnetic reconnection can drive an expansion of the current sheet in\nSaturn's magnetosphere and, consequently, can produce Fermi acceleration of\nelectrons. This reconnection site lasted for longer than one of Saturn's\nrotation period. The long-lasting and corotating natures of the magnetic\nreconnection site at Saturn suggest fundamentally different roles of magnetic\nreconnection in driving magnetospheric dynamics (e.g., the auroral\nprecipitation) from the Earth. Our corotating reconnection picture could also\npotentially shed light on the fast rotating magnetized plasma environments in\nthe solar system and beyond.\n", "  A new generalized Wick theorem for interacting fields in 2D conformal field\ntheory is described. We briefly discuss its relation to the Borcherds identity\nand its derivation by an analytic method. Examples of the calculations of the\noperator product expansions by using the generalized Wick theorems including\nfermionic fields are also presented.\n", "  Higgs bosons pair production is well known for its sensitivity to probing the\nsign and size of Higgs boson self coupling, providing a way to determine\nwhether there is an extended Higgs sector. The Georgi-Machacek (GM) model\nextends the Standard Model (SM) with an $SU(2)_L$ triplet scalar field that has\none real and one complex components. The Higgs self coupling now has a wider\nrange than that in the SM, with even the possibility of a sign flip. The new\nheavy singlet Higgs boson $H^{0}_{1}$ can contribute to s-channel production of\nthe $hh$ pairs. In this work, we study non-resonant/resonant Higgs boson pair\nproductions $p p \\rightarrow hh$ and $p p \\rightarrow H^{0}_{1} \\rightarrow\nhh$, focusing exclusively on the contribution of $H^0_1$. We show the\nsensitivity for Higgs boson pair production searches at the 13-TeV LHC with the\nluminosities of $3.2,\\ 30$ and $100$~fb$^{-1}$.\n", "  Source localization in ocean acoustics is posed as a machine learning problem\nin which data-driven methods learn source ranges directly from observed\nacoustic data. The pressure received by a vertical linear array is preprocessed\nby constructing a normalized sample covariance matrix (SCM) and used as the\ninput. Three machine learning methods (feed-forward neural networks (FNN),\nsupport vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF)) are investigated in this\npaper, with focus on the FNN. The range estimation problem is solved both as a\nclassification problem and as a regression problem by these three machine\nlearning algorithms. The results of range estimation for the Noise09 experiment\nare compared for FNN, SVM, RF and conventional matched-field processing and\ndemonstrate the potential of machine learning for underwater source\nlocalization..\n", "  The concept of quantum coherence, including various ways to quantify the\ndegree of coherence with respect to the prescribed basis, is currently the\nsubject of active research. The complementarity of quantum coherence in\ndifferent bases was studied by deriving upper bounds on the sum of the\ncorresponding measures. To obtain a two-sided estimate, lower bounds on the\ncoherence quantifiers are also of interest. Such bounds are naturally referred\nto as uncertainty relations for quantum coherence. We obtain new uncertainty\nrelations for coherence quantifiers averaged with respect to a set of mutually\nunbiased bases (MUBs). To quantify the degree of coherence, the relative\nentropy of coherence and the geometric coherence are used. Further, we also\nderive novel state-independent uncertainty relations for a set of MUBs in terms\nof the min-entropy.\n", "  The common basis for many high energy astrophysical phenomena is the theory\nof gravitation, for which in modern theoretical physics there are two main\ndirections: Einstein's geometrical and Feynman's nonmetric field approaches for\ndescription of gravitational interaction. Though classical relativistic effects\nhave the same values in both approaches, there are dramatically different\neffects predicted by GRT and FGT for relativistic astrophysics. Crucial\nobservational tests which allow to test the physics of the gravitational\ninteraction are discussed, including detection of gravitational waves by\nadvanced LIGO-Virgo antennas and Event Horizon Telescope observations of active\ngalactic nuclei. Forthcoming relativistic astrophysics can open new ways in\nunderstanding of gravitation and the unification of fundamental physical\ninteraction.\n", "  One emerging approach for the fabrication of complex architectures on the\nnanoscale is to utilize particles customized to intrinsically self-assemble\ninto a desired structure. Inverse methods of statistical mechanics have proven\nparticularly effective for the discovery of interparticle interactions suitable\nfor this aim. Here we evaluate the generality and robustness of a recently\nintroduced inverse design strategy [Lindquist et al., J. Chem. Phys. 145,\n111101 (2016)] by applying this simulated-based, machine learning method to\noptimize for interparticle interactions that self-assemble particles into a\nvariety of complex microstructures: cluster fluids, porous mesophases, and\ncrystalline lattices. Using the method, we discover isotropic pair interactions\nthat lead to self-assembly of each of the desired morphologies, including\nseveral types of potentials that were not previously understood to be capable\nof stabilizing such systems. One such pair potential led to assembly of the\nhighly asymmetric truncated trihexagonal lattice and another produced a fluid\ncontaining spherical voids, or pores, of designed size via purely repulsive\ninteractions. Through these examples, we demonstrate several advantages\ninherent to this particular design approach including the use of a parametrized\nfunctional form for the optimized interparticle interactions, the ability to\nconstrain the range of said parameters, and compatibility of the inverse design\nstrategy with a variety of simulation protocols (e.g., positional restraints).\n", "  In apparent contradiction to the laws of thermodynamics, Maxwell's demon is\nable to cyclically extract work from a system in contact with a thermal bath\nexploiting the information about its microstate. The resolution of this paradox\nrequired the insight that an intimate relationship exists between information\nand thermodynamics. Here, we realize a Maxwell demon experiment that tracks the\nstate of each constituent both in the classical and quantum regimes. The demon\nis a microwave cavity that encodes quantum information about a superconducting\nqubit and converts information into work by powering up a propagating microwave\npulse by stimulated emission. Thanks to the high level of control of\nsuperconducting circuits, we directly measure the extracted work and quantify\nthe entropy remaining in the demon's memory. This experiment provides an\nenlightening illustration of the interplay of thermodynamics with quantum\ninformation.\n", "  We estimate the \"non-gravitational\" entropy-injection profiles, $\\Delta K$,\nand the resultant energy feedback profiles, $\\Delta E$, of the intracluster\nmedium for 17 clusters using their Planck SZ and ROSAT X-Ray observations,\nspanning a large radial range from $0.2r_{500}$ up to $r_{200}$. The feedback\nprofiles are estimated by comparing the observed entropy, at fixed gas mass\nshells, with theoretical entropy profiles predicted from non-radiative\nhydrodynamic simulations. We include non-thermal pressure and gas clumping in\nour analysis. The inclusion of non-thermal pressure and clumping results in\nchanging the estimates for $r_{500}$ and $r_{200}$ by 10\\%-20\\%. When\nclumpiness is not considered it leads to an under-estimation of $\\Delta\nK\\approx300$ keV cm$^2$ at $r_{500}$ and $\\Delta K\\approx1100$ keV cm$^2$ at\n$r_{200}$. On the other hand, neglecting non-thermal pressure results in an\nover-estimation of $\\Delta K\\approx 100$ keV cm$^2$ at $r_{500}$ and\nunder-estimation of $\\Delta K\\approx450$ keV cm$^2$ at $r_{200}$. For the\nestimated feedback energy, we find that ignoring clumping leads to an\nunder-estimation of energy per particle $\\Delta E\\approx1$ keV at $r_{500}$ and\n$\\Delta E\\approx1.5$ keV at $r_{200}$. Similarly, neglect of the non-thermal\npressure results in an over-estimation of $\\Delta E\\approx0.5$ keV at $r_{500}$\nand under-estimation of $\\Delta E\\approx0.25$ keV at $r_{200}$. We find entropy\nfloor of $\\Delta K\\approx300$ keV cm$^2$ is ruled out at $\\approx3\\sigma$\nthroughout the entire radial range and $\\Delta E\\approx1$ keV at more than\n3$\\sigma$ beyond $r_{500}$, strongly constraining ICM pre-heating scenarios. We\nalso demonstrate robustness of results w.r.t sample selection, X-Ray analysis\nprocedures, entropy modeling etc.\n", "  We present a method to construct number-conserving Hamiltonians whose ground\nstates exactly reproduce an arbitrarily chosen BCS-type mean-field state. Such\nparent Hamiltonians can be constructed not only for the usual $s$-wave BCS\nstate, but also for more exotic states of this form, including the ground\nstates of Kitaev wires and 2D topological superconductors. This method leads to\ninfinite families of locally-interacting fermion models with exact topological\nsuperconducting ground states. After explaining the general technique, we apply\nthis method to construct two specific classes of models. The first one is a\none-dimensional double wire lattice model with Majorana-like degenerate ground\nstates. The second one is a two-dimensional $p_x+ip_y$ superconducting model,\nwhere we also obtain analytic expressions for topologically degenerate ground\nstates in the presence of vortices. Our models may provide a deeper conceptual\nunderstanding of how Majorana zero modes could emerge in condensed matter\nsystems, as well as inspire novel routes to realize them in experiment.\n", "  In this article, we present a qualitative approach to study the dynamics and\nstability of micro-machined inductive contactless suspensions (MIS). In the\nframework of this approach, the induced eddy current into a levitated\nmicro-object is considered as a collection of m-eddy current circuits. Assuming\nsmall displacements and the quasi- static behaviour of the levitated\nmicro-object, a generalized model of MIS is obtained and represented as a set\nof six linear differential equations corresponding to six degrees of freedom in\na rigid body by using Lagrange-Maxwell formalism. The linear model allows us to\ninvestigate the general stability properties of the MIS as a dynamic system,\nand these properties are synthesized in three major theorems. In particular, we\nprove that the stable levitation in the MIS without damping is impossible.\nBased on the approach presented herewith, we give general guidelines for MIS\ndesigning. In addition to we demonstrate the successful application of this\ntechnique to study the dynamics and stability of the symmetric and axially\nsymmetric MIS designs both based on 3D micro-coil technology.\n", "  In the hierarchical formation model, galaxy clusters grow by accretion of\nsmaller groups or isolated galaxies. During the infall into the centre of a\ncluster, the properties of accreted galaxies change. In particular, both\nobservations and numerical simulations suggest that its dark matter halo is\nstripped by the tidal forces of the host.\n  We use galaxy-galaxy weak lensing to measure the average mass of dark matter\nhaloes of satellite galaxies as a function of projected distance to the centre\nof the host, for different stellar mass bins. Assuming that the stellar\ncomponent of the galaxy is less disrupted by tidal stripping, stellar mass can\nbe used as a proxy of the infall mass. We study the stellar to halo mass\nrelation of satellites as a function of the cluster-centric distance to measure\ntidal stripping.\n  We use the shear catalogues of the DES science verification archive, the\nCFHTLenS and the CFHT Stripe 82 (CS82) surveys, and we select satellites from\nthe redMaPPer catalogue of clusters. For galaxies located in the outskirts of\nclusters, we find a stellar to halo mass relation in good agreement with the\ntheoretical expectations from \\citet{moster2013} for central galaxies. In the\ncentre of the cluster, we find that this relation is shifted to smaller halo\nmass for a given stellar mass. We interpret this finding as further evidence\nfor tidal stripping of dark matter haloes in high density environments.\n", "  The hallmark of topological phases is their robust boundary signature whose\nintriguing properties---such as the one-way transport on the chiral edge of a\nChern insulator and the sudden disappearance of surface states forming open\nFermi arcs on the surfaces of Weyl semimetals---are impossible to realize on\nthe surface alone. Yet, despite the glaring simplicity of non-interacting\ntopological bulk Hamiltonians and their concomitant energy spectrum, the\ndetailed study of the corresponding surface states has essentially been\nrestricted to numerical simulation. In this work, however, we show that exact\nanalytical solutions of both topological and trivial surface states can be\nobtained for generic tight-binding models on a large class of geometrically\nfrustrated lattices in any dimension without the need for fine-tuning of\nhopping amplitudes. Our solutions derive from local constraints tantamount to\ndestructive interference between neighboring layer lattices perpendicular to\nthe surface and provide microscopic insights into the structure of the surface\nstates that enable analytical calculation of many desired properties. We\nillustrate our general findings on a large number of examples in two and three\nspatial dimensions. Notably, we derive exact chiral Chern insulator edge states\non the spin orbit-coupled kagome lattice, and Fermi arcs relevant for various\nrecently synthesized pyrochlore iridate slabs. Remarkably, each of the\npyrochlore slabs exhibit Fermi arcs although only the ones with a magnetic\none-in-three-out configuration feature bulk Weyl nodes in realistic parameter\nregimes. Our approach furthermore signal the absence of topological surface\nstates, which we illustrate for a class of models akin to the trivial surface\nof Hourglass materials KHg$X$.\n", "  We study general properties of static and spherically symmetric bidiagonal\nblack holes in Hassan-Rosen bimetric theory. In particular, we explore the\nbehaviour of the black hole solutions both at the common Killing horizon and at\nthe large radii. The former study leads to a new classification for black holes\nwithin the bidiagonal ansatz. The latter study shows that, among the great\nvariety of the black hole solutions, the only solutions converging to\nMinkowski, Anti-de Sitter and de Sitter spacetimes at large radii are those of\nGeneral Relativity, i.e., the Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter and\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter solutions.\n", "  The main goal of the article is testing a new classification algorithm. To\nthis end we apply it to a relevant problem of describing the integrable cases\nof a subclass of two-dimensional lattices. By imposing the cut-off conditions\n$u_{-1}=c_0$ and $u_{N+1}=c_1$ we reduce the lattice\n$u_{n,xy}=\\alpha(u_{n+1},u_n,u_{n-1})u_{n,x}u_{n,y}$ to a finite system of\nhyperbolic type PDE. Assuming that for each natural $N$ the obtained system is\nintegrable in the sense of Darboux we look for $\\alpha$. To detect the Darboux\nintegrability of the hyperbolic type system we use an algebraic criterion of\nDarboux integrability which claims that the characteristic Lie rings of such a\nsystem must be of finite dimension. We prove that up to the point\ntransformations only one lattice in the studied class passes the test. The\nlattice coincides with the earlier found Ferapontov-Shabat-Yamilov equation.\nThe one-dimensional reduction $x=y$ of this lattice passes also the symmetry\nintegrability test.\n", "  This work pioneers the quantization of primordial fermion perturbations in\nhybrid Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). We consider a Dirac field coupled to a\nspatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic cosmology, sourced by a scalar\ninflaton, and treat the Dirac field as a perturbation. We describe the\ninhomogeneities of this field in terms of creation and annihilation variables,\nchosen to admit a unitary evolution if the Dirac fermion were treated as a test\nfield. Considering instead the full system, we truncate its action at quadratic\nperturbative order and construct a canonical formulation. In particular this\nimplies that, in the global Hamiltonian constraint of the model, the\ncontribution of the homogeneous sector is corrected with a quadratic\nperturbative term. We then adopt the hybrid LQC approach to quantize the full\nmodel, combining the loop representation of the homogeneous geometry with the\nFock quantization of the inhomogeneities. We assume a Born-Oppenheimer ansatz\nfor physical states and show how to obtain a Schr\\\"odinger equation for the\nquantum evolution of the perturbations, where the role of time is played by the\nhomogeneous inflaton. We prove that the resulting quantum evolution of the\nDirac field is indeed unitary, despite the fact that the underlying homogeneous\ngeometry has been quantized as well. Remarkably, in such evolution, the fermion\nfield couples to an infinite sequence of quantum moments of the homogeneous\ngeometry. Moreover, the evolved Fock vacuum of our fermion perturbations is\nshown to be an exact solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation. Finally, we\ndiscuss in detail the quantum backreaction that the fermion field introduces in\nthe global Hamiltonian constraint. For completeness, our quantum study includes\nsince the beginning (gauge-invariant) scalar and tensor perturbations, that\nwere studied in previous works.\n", "  In the last two decades, many quantum optics experiments have demonstrated\nsmall-scale quantum information processing applications with several photons.\nBeyond such proof-of-principle demonstrations, efficient preparation of large,\nbut definite, numbers of photons is of great importance for further scaling up\nand speeding up photonic quantum information processing. Typical single-photon\ngeneration techniques based on nonlinear parametric processes face challenges\nof probabilistic generation. Here we demonstrate efficient synchronization of\nphotons from multiple nonlinear parametric heralded single-photon sources\n(HSPSs), using quantum memories (QMs). Our low-loss optical memories greatly\nenhance (~30x) the generation rate of coincidence photons from two independent\nHSPSs, while maintaining high indistinguishability (95.7%) of the synchronized\nphotons. As an application, we perform the first demonstration of HSPS-based\nmeasurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD). The\nsynchronized HSPSs demonstrated here will pave the way toward efficient quantum\ncommunication and larger scale optical quantum computing.\n", "  Our ignorance of the period between the end of inflation and the beginning of\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis limits our understanding of the origins and evolution\nof dark matter. One possibility is that the Universe's energy density was\ndominated by a fast-rolling scalar field while the radiation bath was hot\nenough to thermally produce dark matter. We investigate the evolution of the\ndark matter density and derive analytic expressions for the dark matter relic\nabundance generated during such a period of kination. Kination scenarios in\nwhich dark matter does not reach thermal equilibrium require $\\langle \\sigma v\n\\rangle < 2.7\\times 10^{-38} \\,\\mathrm{cm^3\\,s^{-1}}$ to generate the observed\ndark matter density while allowing the Universe to become radiation dominated\nby a temperature of $3 \\, \\mathrm{MeV}$. Kination scenarios in which dark\nmatter does reach thermal equilibrium require $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle >\n3\\times 10^{-26} \\,\\mathrm{cm^3\\,s^{-1}}$ in order to generate the observed\ndark matter abundance. We use observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies by the\nFermi Gamma-Ray Telescope and observations of the Galactic Center by the High\nEnergy Stereoscopic System to constrain these kination scenarios. Combining the\nunitarity constraint on $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ with these observational\nconstraints sets a lower limit on the temperature at which the Universe can\nbecome radiation dominated following a period of kination if ${\\langle \\sigma v\n\\rangle > 3\\times 10^{-31} \\,\\mathrm{cm^3\\,s^{-1}}}$. This lower limit is\nbetween ${0.05 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}}$ and ${1 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}}$, depending on the\ndark matter annihilation channel.\n", "  We consider a simple extension of the minimal left-right symmetric model\n(LRSM) in order to explain the PeV neutrino events seen at the IceCube\nexperiment from a heavy decaying dark matter. The dark matter sector is\ncomposed of two fermions: one at PeV scale and the other at TeV scale such that\nthe heavier one can decay into the lighter one and two neutrinos. The gauge\nannihilation cross sections of PeV dark matter are not large enough to generate\nits relic abundance within the observed limit. We include a pair of real scalar\ntriplets $\\Omega_{L,R}$ which can bring the thermally overproduced PeV dark\nmatter abundance into the observed range through late time decay and consequent\nentropy release thereby providing a consistent way to obtain the correct relic\nabundance without violating the unitarity bound on dark matter mass. Another\nscalar field, a bitriplet under left-right gauge group is added to assist the\nheavier dark matter decay. The presence of an approximate global $U(1)_X$\nsymmetry can naturally explain the origin of tiny couplings required for\nlong-lived nature of these decaying particles. We also show, how such an\nextended LRSM can be incorporated within a non-supersymmetric $SO(10)$ model\nwhere the gauge coupling unification at a very high scale naturally accommodate\na PeV scale intermediate symmetry, required to explain the PeV events at\nIceCube.\n", "  Recent studies of pseudo-plane ideal flow (PIF) reveal a ubiquitous presence\nof vortex alignment in both homogeneous and stratified fluids, and in both\ninertial and rotating reference frames as well. The exact solutions of a\nsteady-state PIF model suggest that stagnation points tend to be vertically\naligned and the concentric structure represents a fixed-point phenomenon of the\nEuler equations. Exception occurs in the rotating frame when a flow holds\ninertial period and skew center becomes possible. Properties of stagnation\npoints based on Morse theory are obtained, leading to a topological explanation\nof vertical alignment via pressure Hessian. The study thus uncovers a new\naspect of vortex behavior in ideal fluid that requires vortex center to align\nwith the direction of gravity when vortex evolution reaches a laminar end state\ncharacterized by steady pseudo-plane velocities. Though the phenomenon arises\nfrom the constraint of the Euler equations, under specific conditions the\ntopological theory is applicable to viscous fluid and explains the curvilinear\ntilting of von K\\'arm\\'an swirling vortex.\n", "  We calculate the parameters describing elastic $I=1$, $P$-wave $\\pi\\pi$\nscattering using lattice QCD with $2+1$ flavors of clover fermions. Our\ncalculation is performed with a pion mass of $m_\\pi \\approx 320\\:\\:{\\rm MeV}$\nand a lattice size of $L\\approx 3.6$ fm. We construct the two-point correlation\nmatrices with both quark-antiquark and two-hadron interpolating fields using a\ncombination of smeared forward, sequential and stochastic propagators. The\nspectra in all relevant irreducible representations for total momenta\n$|\\vec{P}| \\leq \\sqrt{3} \\frac{2\\pi}{L}$ are extracted with two alternative\nmethods: a variational analysis as well as multi-exponential matrix fits. We\nperform an analysis using L\\\"uscher's formalism for the energies below the\ninelastic thresholds, and investigate several phase shift models, including\npossible nonresonant contributions. We find that our data are well described by\nthe minimal Breit-Wigner form, with no statistically significant nonresonant\ncomponent. In determining the $\\rho$ resonance mass and coupling we compare two\ndifferent approaches: fitting the individually extracted phase shifts versus\nfitting the $t$-matrix model directly to the energy spectrum. We find that both\nmethods give consistent results, and at a pion mass of\n$am_{\\pi}=0.18295(36)_{stat}$ obtain $g_{\\rho\\pi\\pi} =\n5.69(13)_{stat}(16)_{sys}$, $am_\\rho = 0.4609(16)_{stat}(14)_{sys}$, and\n$am_{\\rho}/am_{N} = 0.7476(38)_{stat}(23)_{sys} $, where the first uncertainty\nis statistical and the second is the systematic uncertainty due to the choice\nof fit ranges.\n", "  We employ the Langevin equation and Wigner function to describe the bottom\nequark dynamical evolutions and their formation into a bound state in the\nexpanding Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The additional suppressions from parton\ninelastic scatterings are supplemented in the regenerated bottomonium. Hot\nmedium modifications on $\\Upsilon(1S)$ properties are studied consistently by\ntaking the bottomonium potential to be the color-screened potential from\nLattice results, which affects both $\\Upsilon(1S)$ regeneration and\ndissociation rates. Finally, we calculated the $\\Upsilon(1S)$ nuclear\nmodification factor $R_{AA}^{\\rm rege}$ from bottom quark combination with\ndifferent diffusion coefficients in Langevin equation, representing different\nthermalization of bottom quarks. In the central Pb-Pb collisions (b=0) at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, we find a non-negligible $\\Upsilon(1S)$ regeneration,\nand it is small in the minimum bias centrality. The connections between\nbottomonium regeneration and bottom quark energy loss in the heavy ion\ncollisions are also discussed.\n", "  Single-molecule biophysics has transformed our understanding of the\nfundamental molecular processes involved in living biological systems, but also\nof the fascinating physics of life. Far more exotic than a collection of\nexemplars of soft matter behaviour, active biological matter lives far from\nthermal equilibrium, and typically covers multiple length scales from the\nnanometre level of single molecules up several orders of magnitude to longer\nlength scales in emergent structures of cells, tissues and organisms.\nBiological molecules are often characterized by an underlying instability, in\nthat multiple metastable free energy states exist which are separated by energy\nlevels of typically just a few multiples of the thermal energy scale of kBT,\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature, implying\ncomplex, dynamic inter-conversion kinetics across this bumpy free energy\nlandscape in the relatively hot, wet environment of real, living biological\nmatter. The key utility of single-molecule biophysics lies in its ability to\nprobe the underlying heterogeneity of free energy states across a population of\nmolecules, which in general is too challenging for conventional ensemble level\napproaches which measure mean average properties. Parallel developments in both\nexperimental and theoretical techniques have been key to the latest insights\nand are enabling the development of highly-multiplexed, correlative techniques\nto tackle previously intractable biological problems. Experimentally,\ntechnological developments in the sensitivity and speed of biomolecular\ndetectors, the stability and efficiency of light sources, probes and\nmicrofluidics, have enabled and driven the study of heterogeneous behaviours\nboth in vitro and in vivo that were previously undetectable by ensemble\nmethods...\n", "  Three models for nonlocal electron thermal transport are here compared\nagainst Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) codes to assess their accuracy in situations\nrelevant to both inertial fusion hohlraums and tokamak scrape-off layers. The\nmodels tested are (i) a moment-based approach using an eigenvector integral\nclosure (EIC) originally developed by Ji, Held and Sovinec; (ii) the\nnon-Fourier Landau-fluid (NFLF) model of Dimits, Joseph and Umansky; and (iii)\nSchurtz, Nicola\\\"i and Busquet's multigroup diffusion model (SNB). We find that\nwhile the EIC and NFLF models accurately predict the damping rate of a\nsmall-amplitude temperature perturbation (within 10% at moderate\ncollisionalities), they overestimate the peak heat flow by as much as 35% and\ndo not predict preheat in the more relevant case where there is a large\ntemperature difference. The SNB model, however, agrees better with VFP results\nfor the latter problem if care is taken with the definition of the mean free\npath. Additionally, we present for the first time a comparison of the SNB model\nagainst a VFP code for a hohlraum-relevant problem with inhomogeneous\nionisation and show that the model overestimates the heat flow in the helium\ngas-fill by a factor of ~2 despite predicting the peak heat flux to within 16%.\n", "  In this paper, we extend the study initiated in PaperI by modelling grain\nensemble evolution in a dynamical model of an expanding HII region and checking\nthe effects of momentum transfer from dust to gas. The radiation pressure on\nthe dust, the dust drift, and the lug on the gas by the dust are all important\nprocess that should be considered simultaneously to describe the dynamics of\nHII regions. With accounting for the momentum transfer from the dust to the\ngas, the expansion time of the HII region is notably reduced (for our model of\nRCW120, the time to reach the observed radius of the HII region is reduced by a\nfactor of 1.5). Under the common approximation of frozen dust, where there is\nno relative drift between the dust and gas, the radiation pressure from the\nionizing star drives the formation of the very deep gas cavity near the star.\nSuch a cavity is much less pronounced when the dust drift is taken into\naccount. The dust drift leads to the two-peak morphology of the dust density\ndistribution and significantly reduces the dust-to-gas ratio in the ionized\nregion (by a factor of 2 to 10). The dust-to-gas ratio is larger for higher\ntemperatures of the ionizing star since the dust grains have a larger electric\ncharge and are more strongly coupled to the gas.\n", "  We revisit the holographic dictionary for a free massless scalar in AdS$_3$,\nfocusing on the `singleton' solutions for which the boundary profile is an\narbitrary chiral function. We look for consistent boundary conditions which\ninclude this class of solutions. On one hand, we give a no-go argument that\nthey cannot be interpreted within any boundary condition which preserves full\nconformal invariance. On the other hand, we show that such solutions fit\nnaturally in a generalization of the Comp\\`{e}re-Song-Strominger boundary\nconditions, which preserve a chiral Virasoro and current algebra. These\nobservations have implications for the black hole deconstruction proposal,\nwhich proposes singleton solutions as candidate black hole microstate\ngeometries. Our results suggest that the chiral boundary condition, which also\ncontains the extremal BTZ black hole, is the natural setting for\nholographically interpreting the black hole deconstruction proposal.\n", "  Using 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations and analytic theory, we study the\norbital evolution of asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) binary systems for various\ninitial orbital separations and mass ratios, and thus different initial\naccretion modes. The time evolution of binary separations and orbital periods\nare calculated directly from the averaged mass loss rate, accretion rate and\nangular momentum loss rate. We separately consider spin-orbit synchronized and\nzero spin AGB cases. We find that the the angular momentum carried away by the\nmass loss together with the mass transfer can effectively shrink the orbit when\naccretion occurs via wind-Roche-lobe overflow. In contrast, the larger fraction\nof mass lost in Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accreting systems acts to enlarge the\norbit. Synchronized binaries tend to experience stronger orbital period decay\nin close binaries. We also find that orbital period decay is faster when we\naccount for the nonlinear evolution of the accretion mode as the binary starts\nto tighten. This can increase the fraction of binaries that result in common\nenvelope, luminous red novae, Type Ia supernovae and planetary nebulae with\ntight central binaries. The results also imply that planets in the the\nhabitable zone around white dwarfs are unlikely to be found.\n", "  We present results of a survey of 14 star-forming regions from the Perseus\nspiral arm in CS(2-1) and 13CO(1-0) lines with the Onsala Space Observatory 20\nm telescope. Maps of 10 sources in both lines were obtained. For the remaining\nsources a map in just one line or a single-point spectrum were obtained. On the\nbasis of newly obtained and published observational data we consider the\nrelation between velocities of the \"quasi-thermal\" CS(2-1) line and 6.7 GHz\nmethanol maser line in 24 high-mass star-forming regions in the Perseus arm. We\nshow that, surprisingly, velocity ranges of 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission are\npredominantly red-shifted with respect to corresponding CS(2-1) line velocity\nranges in the Perseus arm. We suggest that the predominance of the \"red-shifted\nmasers\" in the Perseus arm could be related to the alignment of gas flows\ncaused by the large-scale motions in the Galaxy. Large-scale galactic shock\nrelated to the spiral structure is supposed to affect the local kinematics of\nthe star-forming regions. Part of the Perseus arm, between galactic longitudes\nfrom 85deg to 124deg, does not contain blue-shifted masers at all. Radial\nvelocities of the sources are the greatest in this particular part of the arm,\nso the velocity difference is clearly pronounced. 13CO(1-0) and CS(2-1)\nvelocity maps of G183.35-0.58 show gas velocity difference between the center\nand the periphery of the molecular clump up to 1.2 km/s. Similar situation is\nlikely to occur in G85.40-0.00. This can correspond to the case when the\nlarge-scale shock wave entrains the outer parts of a molecular clump in motion\nwhile the dense central clump is less affected by the shock.\n", "  We investigate fluctuations of output work for a class of Stirling heat\nengines with working fluid composed of interacting units and compare these\nfluctuations to an average work output. In particular, we focus on engine\nperformance close to a critical point where Carnot's efficiency may be attained\nat a finite power as reported in [M. Campisi and R. Fazio, Nat. Commun. 7,\n11895 (2016)]. We show that the variance of work output per cycle scales with\nthe same critical exponent as the heat capacity of the working fluid. As a\nconsequence, the relative work fluctuation diverges unless the output work\nobeys a rather strict scaling condition, which would be very hard to fulfill in\npractice. Even under this condition, the fluctuations of work and power do not\nvanish in the infinite system size limit. Large fluctuations of output work\nthus constitute inseparable and dominant element in performance of the\nmacroscopic heat engines close to a critical point.\n", "  We discuss the determination of the CKM angle $\\alpha$ using the non-leptonic\ntwo-body decays $B\\to \\pi\\pi$, $B\\to \\rho\\rho$ and $B\\to \\rho\\pi$ using the\nlatest data available. We illustrate the methods used in each case and extract\nthe corresponding value of $\\alpha$. Combining all these elements, we obtain\nthe following determination of $\\alpha_{\\rm dir}=( 86.2^{+4.4}_{-4.0}~~ \\cup~~\n178.4^{+3.9}_{-5.1})^\\circ$. We assess the uncertainties associated to the\nbreakdown of the isospin hypothesis and the choice of statistical framework in\ndetail. We also determine the hadronic amplitudes (tree and penguin) describing\nthe QCD dynamics involved in these decays, briefly comparing our results with\ntheoretical expectations. For each observable of interest in the $B\\to \\pi\\pi$,\n$B\\to \\rho\\rho$ and $B\\to \\rho\\pi$ systems, we perform an indirect\ndetermination based on the constraints from all the other observables available\nand we discuss the compatibility between indirect and direct determinations.\nFinally, we review the impact of future improved measurements on the\ndetermination of $\\alpha$.\n", "  The Discrete Truncated Wigner Approximation (DTWA) is a semi-classical phase\nspace method useful for the exploration of Many-body quantum dynamics. In this\nwork we investigate Many-Body Localization (MBL) and thermalization using DTWA\nand compare its performance to exact numerical solutions. By taking as a\nbenchmark case a 1D random field Heisenberg spin chain with short range\ninteractions, and by comparing to numerically exact techniques, we show that\nDTWA is able to reproduce dynamical signatures that characterize both the\nthermal and the MBL phases. It exhibits the best quantitative agreement at\nshort times deep in each of the phases and larger mismatches close to the phase\ntransition. The DTWA captures the logarithmic growth of entanglement in the MBL\nphase, even though a pure classical mean-field analysis would lead to no\ndynamics at all. Our results suggest the DTWA can become a useful method to\ninvestigate MBL and thermalization in experimentally relevant settings\nintractable with exact numerical techniques, such as systems with long range\ninteractions and/or systems in higher dimensions.\n", "  We investigate the three-point correlation function (3PCF) in the squeezed\nlimit by considering galaxy pairs as discrete objects and cross-correlating\nthem with the galaxy field. We develop an efficient algorithm using Fast\nFourier Transforms to compute such cross-correlations and their associated\npair-galaxy bias bpg and the squeezed 3PCF coefficient Qeff. We implement our\nmethod using N-body cosmological simulations and a fiducial Halo Occupation\nDistribution (HOD) and present the results in both the real space and redshift\nspace. In real space, we observe a peak in bpg and Qeff at pair separation of ~\n2 Mpc, attributed to the fact that galaxy pairs at 2 Mpc separation trace the\nmost massive dark matter halos. We also see strong anisotropy in the bpg and\nQeff signals that track the large-scale filamentary structure. In redshift\nspace, both the 2 Mpc peak and the anisotropy are significantly smeared out\nalong the line-of-sight due to Finger-of-God effect. In both the real space and\nredshift space, the squeezed 3PCF shows a factor of 2 variation, contradicting\nthe hierarchical ansatz but offering rich information on the galaxy-halo\nconnection. Thus, we explore the possibility of using the squeezed 3PCF to\nconstrain the HOD. When we compare two simple HOD models that are closely\nmatched in their projected two-point correlation function (2PCF), we do not yet\nsee a strong variation in the 3PCF that is clearly disentangled from variations\nin the projected 2PCF. Nevertheless, we propose that more complicated HOD\nmodels, e.g. those incorporating assembly bias, can break degeneracies in the\n2PCF and show a distinguishable squeezed 3PCF signal.\n", "  Randomness is an essential resource in computer science. In most applications\nperfect, and sometimes private, randomness is needed, while it is not even\nclear that such a resource exists. It is well known that the tools of classical\ncomputer science do not allow us to create perfect and secret randomness from a\nsingle weak public source. Quantum physics, on the other hand, allows for such\na process, even in the most paranoid cryptographic sense termed \"quantum\ndevice-independent cryptography\". In this work we propose and prove the\nsecurity of a new device-independent protocol that takes any single public\nSantha-Vazirani source as input and creates a secret close to uniform string in\nthe presence of a quantum adversary.\n  Our work is the first to achieve randomness amplification with all the\nfollowing properties: (1) amplification and \"privatization\" of a public\nSantha-Vazirani source with arbitrary bias (2) the use of a device with only\ntwo components (compared to polynomial number of components) (3) non-vanishing\nextraction rate and (4) maximal noise tolerance. In particular, this implies\nthat our protocol is the first protocol that can possibly be implemented with\nreachable parameters. We are able to achieve these by combining three new\ntools: a particular family of Bell inequalities, a proof technique to lower\nbound entropy in the device-independent setting, and a special framework for\nquantum-proof multi-source extractors.\n", "  There is increasing recognition that the multiorbital nature of the 3d\nelectrons is important to the proper description of the electronic states in\nthe normal state of the iron-based superconductors. Earlier studies of the\npertinent multiorbital Hubbard models identified an orbital-selective Mott\nphase, which anchors the orbital-selective behavior seen in the overall phase\ndiagram. An important characteristics of the models is that the orbitals are\nkinetically coupled -- i.e. hybridized -- to each other, which makes the\norbital-selective Mott phase especially nontrivial. A U(1) slave-spin method\nwas used to analyze the model with nonzero orbital-level splittings. Here we\ndevelop a Landau free-energy functional to shed further light on this issue. We\nput the microscopic analysis from the U(1) slave-spin approach in this\nperspective, and show that the intersite spin correlations are crucial to the\nrenormalization of the bare hybridization amplitude towards zero and the\nconcomitant realization of the orbital-selective Mott transition. Based on this\ninsight, we discuss additional ways to study the orbital-selective Mott physics\nfrom a dynamical competition between the interorbital hybridization and\ncollective spin correlations. Our results demonstrate the robustness of the\norbital-selective Mott phase in the multiorbital models appropriate for the\niron-based superconductors.\n", "  Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) are a very well motivated extensions of the\nStandard Model (SM), but the landscape of models and possibilities is\noverwhelming, and different patterns can lead to rather distinct\nphenomenologies. In this work we present a way to automatise the model building\nprocess, by considering a top to bottom approach that constructs viable and\nsensible theories from a small and controllable set of inputs at the high\nscale. By providing a GUT scale symmetry group and the field content, possible\nsymmetry breaking paths are generated and checked for consistency, ensuring\nanomaly cancellation, SM embedding and gauge coupling unification. We emphasise\nthe usefulness of this approach for the particular case of a non-supersymmetric\nSO(10) model with an intermediate left-right symmetry and we analyse how\nlow-energy observables such as proton decay and lepton flavour violation might\naffect the generated model landscape.\n", "  Numerical studies of the May-Leonard model for cyclically competing species\nexhibit spontaneous spatial structures in the form of spirals. It is desirable\nto obtain a simple coarse-grained evolution equation describing spatio-temporal\npattern formation in such spatially extended stochastic population dynamics\nmodels. Extending earlier work on the corresponding deterministic system, we\nderive the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as the effective representation of\nthe fully stochastic dynamics of this paradigmatic model for cyclic dominance\nnear its Hopf bifurcation, and for small fluctuations in the three-species\ncoexistence regime. The internal stochastic reaction noise is accounted for\nthrough the Doi-Peliti coherent-state path integral formalism, and subsequent\nmapping to three coupled non-linear Langevin equations. This analysis provides\nconstraints on the model parameters that allow time scale separation and in\nconsequence a further reduction to just two coarse-grained slow degrees of\nfreedom.\n", "  The effective Higgs theories at the TeV scale in supersymmetric $SU(5)$ grand\nunification models are systematically derived. Restricted to extensions on\n$\\mathbf{5}_{H}$ containing the Higgs sector we show that only two types of\nreal (vector-like) models and one type of chiral model are found to be\nconsistent with perturbative grand unification. While the chiral model has been\nexcluded by the LHC data, the fate of perturbative unification will be uniquely\ndetermined by the two classes of vector-like models.\n", "  The main objective for this research was the analytical exploration of the\ndynamics of planar satellite rotation during the motion of an elliptical orbit\naround a planet. First, we revisit the results of J. Wisdom et al. (1984), in\nwhich, by the elegant change of variables (considering the true anomaly f as\nthe independent variable), the governing equation of satellite rotation takes\nthe form of an Abel ODE of the second kind, a sort of generalization of the\nRiccati ODE. We note that due to the special character of solutions of a\nRiccati-type ODE, there exists the possibility of sudden jumping in the\nmagnitude of the solution at some moment of time. In the physical sense, this\njumping of the Riccati-type solutions of the governing ODE could be associated\nwith the effect of sudden acceleration/deceleration in the satellite rotation\naround the chosen principle axis at a definite moment of parametric time. This\nmeans that there exists not only a chaotic satellite rotation regime (as per\nthe results of J. Wisdom et al. (1984)), but a kind of gradient catastrophe\n(Arnold 1992) could occur during the satellite rotation process. We especially\nnote that if a gradient catastrophe could occur, this does not mean that it\nmust occur: such a possibility depends on the initial conditions. In addition,\nwe obtained asymptotical solutions that manifest a quasi-periodic character\neven with the strong simplifying assumptions e ~ 0, p = 1, which reduce the\ngoverning equation of J. Wisdom et al. (1984) to a kind of Beletskii equation.\n", "  Solar cells employing quantum wells can enhance the light absorption but\nsuffer from the difficulty in photogenerated carrier extraction. Here, we\nanalyzed the spectral response and the photocarrier collection mechanism of\np-i-n multiple quantum well (MQW) solar cells using the effective-mobility\nmodel. Both the simulation and experiment results imply that the spatial\nprofiles of electron and hole densities in MQWs play an important role in the\ncarrier collection process. By considering the recombination increment under\nillumination, our findings suggest that the concept of the majority/minority\ncarriers is important even in the intrinsic region: photogenerated electrons\nand holes only experience significant recombination when passing through the\nhole-rich and electron-rich regions, respectively. This can accurately explain\nthe photocurrent behavior in cells with high background doping, background\nillumination, and different MQW positions. Based on the experimental findings,\nwe derived analytical formulae for carrier collection efficiency, which\ndirectly show the impact of each cell parameter and can be used for the\nsystematic cell design.\n", "  The real-time dissociation of the heavy quarkonium in a strongly coupled\nboost-invariant non-Abelian plasma relaxing towards equilibrium is analyzed in\na holographic framework. The effects driving the plasma out of equilibrium are\ndescribed by boundary quenching, impulsive variations of the boundary metric.\nQuarkonium is represented by a classical string with endpoints kept close to\nthe boundary. The evolution of the string profile is computed in the\ntime-dependent geometry, and the dissociation time is evaluated for different\nconfigurations with respect to the direction of the plasma expansion.\nDissociation occurs fastly for the quarkonium placed in the transverse plane.\n", "  The common feature of various plasmonic schemes is their ability to confine\noptical fields of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) into sub-wavelength volumes\nand thus achieve a large enhancement of linear and nonlinear optical\nproperties. This ability, however, is severely limited by the large ohmic loss\ninherent to even the best of metals. However, in the mid and far infrared\nranges of the spectrum there exists a viable alternative to metals, polar\ndielectrics and semiconductors in which dielectric permittivity (the real part)\nturns negative in the Reststrahlen region. This feature engenders the so-called\nsurface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) capable of confining the field in a way akin\nto their plasmonic analogues, the SPPs. Since the damping rate of polar phonons\nis substantially less than that of free electrons, it is not unreasonable to\nexpect that phononic devices may outperform their plasmonic counterparts. Yet a\nmore rigorous analysis of the comparative merits of phononics and plasmonics\nreveals a more nuanced answer, namely that while phononic schemes do exhibit\nnarrower resonances and can achieve a very high degree of energy concentration,\nmost of the energy is contained in the form of lattice vibrations so that\nenhancement of the electric field, and hence the Purcell factor, is rather\nsmall compared to what can be achieved with metal nanoantennas. Still, the\nsheer narrowness of phononic resonances is expected to make phononics viable in\napplications where frequency selectivity is important.\n", "  For primordial black holes (PBH) to be the dark matter in single-field\ninflation, the slow-roll approximation must be violated by at least ${\\cal\nO}(1)$ in order to enhance the curvature power spectrum within the required\nnumber of efolds between CMB scales and PBH mass scales. Power spectrum\npredictions which rely on the inflaton remaining on the slow-roll attractor can\nfail dramatically leading to qualitatively incorrect conclusions in models like\nan inflection potential and misestimate the mass scale in a running mass model.\nWe show that an optimized temporal evaluation of the Hubble slow-roll\nparameters to second order remains a good description for a wide range of PBH\nformation models where up to a $10^7$ amplification of power occurs in $10$\nefolds or more.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the ground-state entanglement in disordered\nfractional quantum Hall liquids. We consider electrons at various filling\nfractions $f$ in the lowest Landau level, with Coulomb interactions. At\n$f=1/3,1/5$ and $2/5$ where an incompressible ground-state manifold exists at\nzero disorder, we observe a pronounced minimum in the derivative of\nentanglement entropy with respect to disorder. At each filling, the position of\nthis minimum is stable against increasing system size, but its magnitude grows\nmonotonically and appears to diverge in the thermodynamic limit. We consider\nthis behaviour of the entropy derivative as a compelling signal of the expected\ndisorder-driven phase transition from a topological fractional quantum Hall\nphase to a trivial insulating phase. On the contrary, at $f=1/2$ where a\ncompressible composite fermion sea is present at zero disorder, the entropy\nderivative exhibits much greater, almost chaotic, finite-size effects, without\na clear phase transition signal for system sizes within our exact\ndiagonalization limit. However, the dependence of entanglement entropy with\nsystem size changes with increasing disorder, consistent with the expectation\nof a phase transition from a composite fermion sea to an insulator. Finally, we\nconsider $f=1/7$ where compressible Wigner crystals are quite competitive at\nzero disorder, and analyze the level statistics of entanglement spectrum at\n$f=1/3$.\n", "  Martini et al. [Phys. Rev. C 94, 015501 (2016)] recently observed that when\nthe produced-lepton's mass plays an important role, the charged-current\nquasielastic cross section for muon neutrinos can be higher than that for\nelectron neutrinos. Here I argue that this effect appears solely in the\ntheoretical descriptions of nuclear effects in which nucleon knockout requires\nthe energy and momentum transfers to lie in a narrow range of the kinematically\nallowed values.\n", "  Based on correlations of coherently displaced photon-numbers, we derive\nentanglement criteria for the purpose to verify non-Gaussian entanglement. Our\nconstruction method enables us to verify bipartite and multipartite\nentanglement of complex states of light. An important advantage of our\ntechnique is that the certified entanglement even persists in the presence of\narbitrarily high, constant losses. We exploit experimental correlation schemes\nfor the two-mode and multimode scenarios, which allow us to directly measure\nthe desired observables. To detect entanglement of a given state, a genetic\nalgorithm is applied to optimize over the infinite set of our constructed\nwitnesses. In particular, we provide suitable witnesses for several distinct\ntwo-mode states. Moreover, a mixed non-Gaussian four-mode state is shown to be\nentangled in all possible non-trivial partitions.\n", "  Information on quantum systems can be obtained only when they are open (or\nopened) in relation to a certain environment. As a matter of fact, realistic\nopen quantum systems appear in very different shape. We sketch the theoretical\ndescription of open quantum systems by means of a projection operator formalism\nelaborated many years ago, and applied by now to the description of different\nopen quantum systems. The Hamiltonian describing the open quantum system is\nnon-Hermitian. Most studied are the eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian of many-particle systems embedded in one environment. We point to\nthe unsolved problems of this method when applied to the description of\nrealistic many-body systems. We then underline the role played by the\neigenfunctions of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Very interesting results\noriginate from the fluctuations of the eigenfunctions in systems with gain and\nloss of excitons. They occur with an efficiency of nearly 100\\%. An example is\nthe photosynthesis.\n", "  The production of a background of super-horizon curvature perturbations with\nthe appropriate (red) spectrum needed to trigger the cosmic anisotropies\nobserved on large scales is associated, in the context of pre-big bang\ninflation, with a phase of growing string coupling. The extension towards the\npast of such a phase is not limited in time by the dynamical backreaction of\nthe quantum perturbations of the cosmological geometry and of its sources. A\nviable, slightly red spectrum of scalar perturbations can thus be the output of\nan asymptotic, perturbative regime which is well compatible with an initial\nstring-vacuum state satisfying the postulate of \"Asymptotic Past Triviality\".\n", "  We experimentally investigate $\\sigma^+$-$\\sigma^-$ polarization gradient\ncooling~(PGC) of a single $^{87}$Rb atom in a tightly focused dipole trap and\nshow that the cooling limit strongly depends on the polarization of the\ntrapping field. For optimized cooling light power, the temperature of the atom\nreaches~$10.4(6)\\,\\mu$K in a linearly polarized trap, approximately five times\nlower than in a circularly polarized trap. The inhibition of PGC is\nqualitatively explained by the fictitious magnetic fields induced by the\ntrapping field. We further demonstrate that switching the trap polarization\nfrom linear to circular after PGC induces only minor heating.\n", "  The influence that the kinematics of pitching and heaving 2D airfoils have on\nthe aerodynamic forces is investigated using Direct Numerical Simulations and a\nforce decomposition algorithm. Large amplitude motions are considered (of the\norder of one chord), with moderate Reynolds numbers and reduced frequencies of\norder 1, varying the mean pitch angle and the phase shift between the pitching\nand heaving motions. Our results show that the surface vorticity contribution\n(viscous effects) to the aerodynamic force is negligible compared to the\ncontributions from the body motion (fluid inertia) and the vorticity within the\nflow (circulation). For the range of parameters considered here, the latter\ntends to be instantaneously oriented in the direction normal to the chord of\nthe airfoil. Based on the results discussed in the paper, a reduced order model\nfor the instantaneous aerodynamic force is proposed, taking advantage of the\nforce decomposition and the chord-normal orientation of the contribution from\nvorticity within the flow to the total aerodynamic force. The predictions of\nthe proposed model are compared to those of a similar model from the\nliterature, showing a noticeable improvement on the prediction of the mean\nthrust, and a smaller improvement on the prediction of mean lift and the\ninstantaneous force coefficients.\n", "  Multi-conjugated adaptive optics (MCAO) yield nearly diffraction-limited\nimages at 2$\\mu$m wavelengths. Currently, GeMS/GSAOI at Gemini South is the\nonly MCAO facility instrument at an 8m telescope. Using real data and for the\nfirst time, we investigate the gain in depth and S/N when MCAO is employed for\n$K_{\\rm s}$-band observations of distant galaxies. Our analysis is based on the\nFrontier Fields cluster MACS J0416.1-2403, observed with GeMS/GSAOI (near\ndiffraction-limited) and compared against VLT/HAWK-I (natural seeing) data.\nUsing galaxy number counts, we show that the substantially increased thermal\nbackground and lower optical throughput of the MCAO unit are fully compensated\nfor by the wavefront correction, because the galaxy images can be measured in\nsmaller apertures with less sky noise. We also performed a direct comparison of\nthe signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of sources detected in both data sets. For\nobjects with intrinsic angular sizes corresponding to half the HAWK-I image\nseeing, the gain in S/N is 40 per cent. Even smaller objects experience a boost\nin S/N by a up to a factor of 2.5 despite our suboptimal natural guide star\nconfiguration. The depth of the near diffraction limited images is more\ndifficult to quantify than that of seeing limited images, due to a strong\ndependence on the intrinsic source profiles. Our results emphasize the\nimportance of cooled MCAO systems for $K_{\\rm s}$-band observations with\nfuture, extremely large telescopes.\n", "  We report a systematic study of the structure, electric and magnetic\nproperties of Ca$_3$Co$_{2-x}$Mn$_x$O$_6$ single crystals with $x =$ 0.72 and\n0.26. The DC and AC magnetic susceptibilities display anomalies with\ncharacteristic of the spin freezing. The crystals show ferroelectric transition\nat 40 K and 35 K ($T_{FE}$) for $x =$ 0.72 and 0.26, respectively, with a large\nvalue of 1400 $\\mu$C/m$^2$ at 8 K for electric polarization ($P_c$) along the\nspin-chain ($c$-axis) direction. Interestingly, the electric polarization\nperpendicular to the chain direction ($P_{ab}$) can also be detected and has\nvalue of 450 and 500 $\\mu$C/m$^2$ at 8 K for the $x =$ 0.72 and 0.26 samples,\nrespectively. The specific heat and magnetic susceptibility show no anomaly\naround $T_{FE}$, which means that the electric polarization of these samples\nhas no direct relationship with the magnetism. The X-ray diffraction and the\nRaman spectroscopy indicate that these samples may undergo Jahn-Teller\ndistortions that could be the reason of electric polarization.\n", "  We provide a novel and simple description of Schellekens' seventy-one affine\nKac-Moody structures of self-dual vertex operator algebras of central charge 24\nby utilizing cyclic subgroups of the glue codes of the Niemeier lattices with\nroots. We also discuss a possible uniform construction procedure of the\nself-dual vertex operator algebras of central charge 24 starting from the Leech\nlattice. This also allows us to consider the uniqueness question for all\nnon-trivial affine Kac-Moody structures. We finally discuss our description\nfrom a Lorentzian viewpoint.\n", "  The effective chiral model is extended by introducing the contributions from\nthe cross-couplings between isovector and isoscalar mesons. These\ncross-couplings are found to be instrumental in improving the density content\nof the nuclear symmetry energy. The nuclear symmetry energy as well as its\nslope and curvature parameters at the saturation density are in harmony with\nthose deduced from a diverse set of experimental data. The equation of state\nfor pure neutron matter at sub-saturation densities is also in accordance with\nthe ones obtained from different microscopic models. The maximum mass of\nneutron star is consistent with the measurement and the radius at the canonical\nmass of the neutron star is within the empirical bounds.\n", "  Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is an emerging computed imaging\nmodality that exploits optical contrast and ultrasonic detection principles to\nform images of the absorbed optical energy density within tissue. If the object\npossesses spatially variant acoustic properties that are unaccounted for by the\nreconstruction method, the estimated image can contain distortions. While\nreconstruction methods have recently been developed to compensate for this\neffect, they generally require the object's acoustic properties to be known a\npriori. To circumvent the need for detailed information regarding an object's\nacoustic properties, we previously proposed a half-time reconstruction method\nfor PACT. A half-time reconstruction method estimates the PACT image from a\ndata set that has been temporally truncated to exclude the data components that\nhave been strongly aberrated. However, this method can be improved upon when\nthe approximate sizes and locations of isolated heterogeneous structures, such\nas bones or gas pockets, are known. To address this, we investigate PACT\nreconstruction methods that are based on a variable data truncation (VDT)\napproach. The VDT approach represents a generalization of the half-time\napproach, in which the degree of temporal truncation for each measurement is\ndetermined by the distance between the corresponding ultrasonic transducer\nlocation and the nearest known bone or gas void location. Computer-simulated\nand experimental data are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\napproach in mitigating artifacts due to acoustic heterogeneities.\n", "  We have combined elastic and inelastic neutron scattering techniques,\nmagnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements to study single-crystal\nsamples of K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$, which contain the superconducting phase that\nhas a transition temperature of $\\sim$31 K. In the inelastic neutron scattering\nmeasurements, we observe both the spin-wave excitations resulting from the\nblock antiferromagnetic ordered phase and the resonance that is associated with\nthe superconductivity in the superconducting phase, demonstrating the\ncoexistence of these two orders. From the temperature dependence of the\nintensity of the magnetic Bragg peaks, we find that well before entering the\nsuperconducting state, the development of the magnetic order is interrupted, at\n$\\sim$42 K. We consider this result to be evidence for the physical separation\nof the antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases; the suppression is\npossibly due to the proximity effect of the superconducting fluctuations on the\nantiferromagnetic order.\n", "  Graphene may be a fascinating material but at this time there exists no\nexperimental or theoretical evidence that it can improve performance of\npractical nonlinear optical devices.\n", "  We describe the kinetics and thermodynamics of copolymers undergoing\nrecombination reactions, which are important for prebiotic chemistry. We use\ntwo approaches: the first one, based on chemical rate equations and the\nmass-action law describes the infinite size limit, while the second one, based\non the chemical master equation, describes systems of finite size. We compare\nthe predictions of both approaches for the relaxation of thermodynamic\nquantities towards equilibrium. We find that for some choice of initial\nconditions, the entropy of the sequence distribution can be lowered at the\nexpense of increasing the entropy of the length distribution. We consider\nmainly energetically neutral reactions, except for one simple case of\nnon-neutral reactions.\n", "  The X-ray emission from the massive binary WR 146R is analysed in the\nframework of the colliding stellar wind (CSW) picture. The theoretical CSW\nmodel spectra match well the shape of the observed X-ray spectrum of WR 146R\nbut they overestimate considerably the observed X-ray flux (emission measure).\nThis is valid both in the case of complete temperature equalization and in the\ncase of partial electron heating at the shock fronts (different electron and\nion temperatures), but, there are indications for a better correspondence\nbetween model predictions and observations for the latter. To reconcile the\nmodel predictions and observations, the mass-loss rate of WR 146 must be\nreduced by a factor of 8 - 10 compared to the currently accepted value for this\nobject (the latter already takes clumping into account). No excess X-ray\nabsorption is derived from the CSW modelling.\n", "  A method to extract Wilson coefficients for semi-leptonic $b\\rightarrow s$\ntransition and form factors for the hadronic process $B\\rightarrow\nK^*\\mu^+\\mu^-$ is suggested. The method is based on data of angular\ndistribution of the process $B\\rightarrow K^*(\\rightarrow K \\pi)\\mu^+\\mu^-$\nwith the optimized observables plotted as functions of dilepton invariant mass\nsquared. We have constructed plots of the observables using present knowledge\nof Wilson coefficients and form factors. Assuming these plots to be\nexperimental data, we have discussed and used the strategy to determine the\nform factors and Wilson coefficients. The method is novel as this provides a\nform-factor-independent determination of Wilson coefficients and also provides\na reliable data driven method to extract information about form factors.\n", "  The development of precision cosmology with clusters of galaxies requires\nhigh-angular resolution Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations. As for now,\narcmin resolution SZ observations (e.g. SPT, ACT and Planck) only allowed\ndetailed studies of the intra cluster medium for low redshift clusters (z<0.2).\nWith both a wide field of view (6.5 arcmin) and a high angular resolution (17.7\nand 11.2 arcsec at 150 and 260 GHz), the NIKA2 camera installed at the IRAM\n30-m telescope (Pico Veleta, Spain), will bring valuable information in the\nfield of SZ imaging of clusters of galaxies. The NIKA2 SZ observation program\nwill allow us to observe a large sample of clusters (50) at redshifts between\n0.4 and 0.9. As a pilot study for NIKA2, several clusters of galaxies have been\nobserved with the pathfinder, NIKA, at the IRAM 30-m telescope to cover the\nvarious configurations and observation conditions expected for NIKA2.\n", "  Room temperature operation is mandatory for any optoelectronics technology\nwhich aims to provide low-cost compact systems for widespread applications. In\nrecent years, an important technological effort in this direction has been made\nin bolometric detection for thermal imaging$^1$, which has delivered relatively\nhigh sensitivity and video rate performance ($\\sim$ 60 Hz). However, room\ntemperature operation is still beyond reach for semiconductor photodetectors in\nthe 8-12 $\\mu$m wavelength band$^2$, and all developments for applications such\nas imaging, environmental remote sensing and laser-based free-space\ncommunication$^{3-5}$ have therefore had to be realised at low temperatures.\nFor these devices, high sensitivity and high speed have never been compatible\nwith high temperature operation$^{6, 7}$. Here, we show that a 9 $\\mu$m quantum\nwell infrared photodetector$^8$, implemented in a metamaterial made of\nsubwavelength metallic resonators$^{9-12}$, has strongly enhanced performances\nup to room temperature. This occurs because the photonic collection area is\nincreased with respect to the electrical area for each resonator, thus\nsignificantly reducing the dark current of the device$^{13}$. Furthermore, we\nshow that our photonic architecture overcomes intrinsic limitations of the\nmaterial, such as the drop of the electronic drift velocity with\ntemperature$^{14, 15}$, which constrains conventional geometries at cryogenic\noperation$^6$. Finally, the reduced physical area of the device and its\nincreased responsivity allows us, for the first time, to take advantage of the\nintrinsic high frequency response of the quantum detector$^7$ at room\ntemperature. By beating two quantum cascade lasers$^{16}$ we have measured the\nheterodyne signal at high frequencies up to 4 GHz.\n", "  We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations\nof the star-forming environment surrounding V1647 Ori, an outbursting FUor/EXor\npre-MS star. Dust continuum and the (J = 2 - 1) $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O\nmolecular emission lines were observed to characterize the V1647 Ori\ncircumstellar disc and any large scale molecular features present. We detect\ncontinuum emission from the circumstellar disc and determine a radius r = 40\nau, inclination i = 17$^{\\circ}$$^{+6}_{-9}$ and total disc mass of\nM$_{\\mathrm{disk}}$ of ~0.1 M$_{\\odot}$. We do not identify any disc structures\nassociated with nearby companions, massive planets or fragmentation. The\nmolecular cloud environment surrounding V1647 Ori is both structured and\ncomplex. We confirm the presence of an excavated cavity north of V1647 Ori and\nhave identified dense material at the base of the optical reflection nebula\n(McNeil's Nebula) that is actively shaping its surrounding environment. Two\ndistinct outflows have been detected with dynamical ages of ~11,700 and 17,200\nyears. These outflows are misaligned suggesting disc precession over ~5500\nyears as a result of anisotropic accretion events is responsible. The\ncollimated outflows exhibit velocities of ~2 km s$^{-1}$, similar in velocity\nto that of other FUor objects presented in this series but significantly slower\nthan previous observations and model predictions. The V1647 Ori system is\nseemingly connected by an \"arm\" of material to a large unresolved structure\nlocated ~20$\"$ to the west. The complex environment surrounding V1647 Ori\nsuggests it is in the early stages of star formation which may relate to its\nclassification as both an FUor and EXor type object.\n", "  We analyse newly obtained Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging for two nearby\nstrong lensing elliptical galaxies, SNL-1 (z = 0.03) and SNL-2 (z = 0.05), in\norder to improve the lensing mass constraints. The imaging reveals previously\nunseen structure in both the lens galaxies and lensed images. For SNL-1 which\nhas a well resolved source, we break the mass-vs-shear degeneracy using the\nrelative magnification information, and measure a lensing mass of 9.49 $\\pm$\n0.15 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$, a 7 per cent increase on the previous\nestimate. For SNL-2 the imaging reveals a bright unresolved component to the\nsource and this presents additional complexity due to possible AGN microlensing\nor variability. We tentatively use the relative magnification information to\nconstrain the contribution from SNL-2's nearby companion galaxy, measuring a\nlensing mass of 12.59 $\\pm$ 0.30 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$, a 9 per cent\nincrease in mass. Our improved lens modelling reduces the mass uncertainty from\n5 and 10 per cent to 2 and 3 per cent respectively. Our results support the\nconclusions of the previous analysis, with newly measured mass excess\nparameters of 1.17 $\\pm$ 0.09 and 0.96 $\\pm$ 0.10 for SNL-1 and SNL-2, relative\nto a Milky-Way like (Kroupa) initial mass function.\n", "  We investigate the nature of the extragalactic unresolved gamma-ray\nbackground (UGRB) by cross-correlating several galaxy catalogs with sky-maps of\nthe UGRB built from 78 months of Pass 8 Fermi-Large Area Telescope data. This\nstudy updates and improves similar previous analyses in several aspects.\nFirstly, the use of a larger gamma-ray dataset allows us to investigate the\nenergy dependence of the cross-correlation in more detail, using up to 8 energy\nbins over a wide energy range of [0.25-500] GeV. Secondly, we consider larger\nand deeper catalogs (2MASS Photometric-Redshift catalog, 2MPZ; WISE x\nSuperCOSMOS, WISC; and SDSS-DR12 photometric-redshift dataset) in addition to\nthe ones employed in the previous studies (NVSS and SDSS-QSOs). Thirdly, we\nexploit the redshift information available for the above catalogs to divide\nthem into redshift bins and perform the cross-correlation separately in each of\nthem.\n  Our results confirm, with higher statistical significance, the detection of\ncross-correlation signal between the UGRB maps and all the catalogs considered,\non angular scales smaller than 1 degree. Significances range from 16.3 sigma\nfor NVSS, 7 sigma for SDSS-DR12 and WISC, 5 sigma for 2MPZ and 4 sigma for\nSDSS-QSOs. Furthermore, including redshift tomography, the significance of the\nSDSS-DR12 signal strikingly rises up to 12 sigma and the one of WISC to 10.6\nsigma. We offer a simple interpretation of the signal in the framework of the\nhalo model. The precise redshift and energy information allows us to clearly\ndetect a change over redshift in the spectral and clustering behavior of the\ngamma-ray sources contributing to the UGRB.\n", "  Umbral moonshine connects the symmetry groups of the 23 Niemeier lattices\nwith 23 sets of distinguished mock modular forms. The 23 cases of umbral\nmoonshine have a uniform relation to symmetries of $K3$ string theories.\nMoreover, a supersymmetric vertex operator algebra with Conway sporadic\nsymmetry also enjoys a close relation to the $K3$ elliptic genus. Inspired by\nthe above two relations between moonshine and $K3$ string theory, we construct\na chiral CFT by orbifolding the free theory of 24 chiral fermions and two pairs\nof fermionic and bosonic ghosts. In this paper we mainly focus on the case of\numbral moonshine corresponding to the Niemeier lattice with root system given\nby 6 copies of $D_4$ root system. This CFT then leads to the construction of an\ninfinite-dimensional graded module for the umbral group $G^{D_4^{\\oplus 6}}$\nwhose graded characters coincide with the umbral moonshine functions. We also\ncomment on how one can recover all umbral moonshine functions corresponding to\nthe Niemeier root systems $A_5^{\\oplus 4}D_4$, $A_7^{\\oplus 2}D_5^{\\oplus 2}$ ,\n$A_{11}D_7 E_6$, $A_{17}E_7$, and $D_{10}E_7^{\\oplus 2}$.\n", "  In this survey, we relate frame theory and quantum information theory,\nfocusing on quantum 2-designs. These are arrangements of weighted subspaces\nwhich are in a specific sense optimal for quantum state tomography. After a\nbrief introduction, we discuss the role of POVMs in quantum theory, developing\nthe importance of quantum 2-designs. In the final section, we collect many if\nnot most known examples of quantum-2 designs to date.\n", "  We report on a theoretical study of the spin Hall Effect (SHE) and weak\nantilocal-ization (WAL) in graphene/transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC)\nheterostructures, computed through efficient real-space quantum transport\nmethods, and using realistic tight-binding models parametrized from ab initio\ncalculations. The graphene/WS 2 system is found to maximize spin proximity\neffects compared to graphene on MoS 2 , WSe 2 , or MoSe 2 , with a crucial role\nplayed by disorder, given the disappearance of SHE signals in the presence of\nstrong intervalley scattering. Notably, we found that stronger WAL effects are\nconcomitant with weaker charge-to-spin conversion efficiency. For further\nexperimental studies of graphene/TMDC heterostructures, our findings provide\nguidelines for reaching the upper limit of spin current formation and for fully\nharvesting the potential of two-dimensional materials for spintronic\napplications.\n", "  We report the results of x-ray scattering studies of AlN on c-plane sapphire\nduring reactive radiofrequency magnetron sputtering. The sensitivity of in situ\nx-ray measurements allowed us to follow the structural evolution of strain and\nroughness from initial nucleation layers to fullyrelaxed AlN films. A growth\nrate transient was observed, consistent with the initial formation of\nnon-coalesced islands with significant oxygen incorporation from the substrate.\nFollowing island coalescence, a steady state growth rate was seen with a\ncontinuous shift of the c and a lattice parameters towards the relaxed bulk\nvalues as growth progressed, with films reaching a fully relaxed state at\nthicknesses of about 30 nm.\n", "  For holographic memory applications, the photorefraction of well-known\nferroelectric such as lithium niobate doped with different transition metals is\nvery important. First principles study assumes special significance in this\ncontext, as to why certain transition metal atoms are better than the other. In\nthis work, Nb atom in LiNbO3 was substituted with transition elements having\nvalency greater than/equal to +5 for UV photorefraction applications, and\natomistic first-principles calculations were done using HSE06 functionals. The\nd-states of the transitional elements were found to decrease the band-gap of\nthe host material having implications for a suitable material design. Minimum\nband-gap was obtained for W, while Ta showed a maximum value. Absorption\ncoefficients were estimated for each material and based on their low values at\n351 nm (i.e. for holographic applications) that is the usual UV photorefraction\nwavelength, the elements found suitable were V, W, Ta, Mo. Then birefringence\nproperties for these crystals were also studied to predict that V and W were\ngood candidates.\n", "  We analyze several thousand Cassini ISS images in order to study the inner\nedge of the Keeler gap in Saturn's outer A ring. We find strong evidence for an\nm=32 perturbation with a mean amplitude of radial variation of 4.5 km. Phase\nanalysis yields a pattern speed consistent with the mean motion of Prometheus,\nindicating that this pattern is generated by the 32:31 Inner Lindblad resonance\nwith Prometheus. In addition, we find evidence of 18-lobed and 20-lobed\npatterns with amplitudes of ~1.5 km. These patterns, whose rotation rates\ncorrespond to resonance locations ~4 km interior to the gap edge, are believed\nto be normal modes. The former is probably related to the nearby 18:17 (m=18)\nresonance with Pandora. In addition to these resonant and normal mode patterns,\nwe also observe multiple localized features that appear to move at the local\nkeplerian rate and that persist for only a few months. One hypothesis is that\ndifferent groups of ring particles at the inner edge of the gap may be reacting\ndifferently to the resonance with Prometheus, with local variations in the\nforced eccentricity and/or pericenter; an alternative hypothesis is the\nexistence of several unseen objects embedded at or near the inner edge of the\nKeeler gap, similar to those suspected to exist at the outer edges of the A and\nB rings (Spitale and Porco 2009, 2010). In either case, observations of the\nring edge at opposite ansae demonstrate that the localized features must be on\neccentric orbits.\n", "  The force fields of interior boundaries of matters are calculated as\nsuperposition of fields of modified Sierpinski carpet. The long-range effect\ninteraction in irradiated crystals is introduced as various manifestations of\nsecond order phase transition.\n", "  We studied electrical resistance of a single-crystalline SmB6 sample with a\nfocus on the region of the \"low-temperature resistivity plateau\". Our\nobservations did not show any true saturation of the electrical resistance at\ntemperatures below 3 K down to 70 mK. According to our findings, temperature\ndependence of the electrical conduction in a certain temperature interval above\n70 mK can be decomposed into a temperature-independent term and a\ntemperature-activated term that can be described by variable-range hopping\nformula for two-dimensional systems, exp[-T0/T)^1/3]. Thus, our results\nindicate importance of hopping type of electrical transport in the near-surface\nregion of SmB6.\n", "  The spin relaxation dynamics of Ce$^{3+}$ ions in heavily cerium-doped YAG\ncrystals is studied using pulse-electron paramagnetic resonance and\ntime-resolved pump-probe Faraday rotation. Both techniques address the 4$f$\nground state, while pump-probe Faraday rotation provides also access to the\nexcited 5$d$ state. We measure a millisecond spin-lattice relaxation time\n$T_1$, a microsecond spin coherence time $T_2$ and a $\\sim 10$ ns inhomogeneous\nspin dephasing time $T_2^*$ for the Ce$^{3+}$ ground state at low temperatures.\nThe spin-lattice relaxation of Ce$^{3+}$ ions is due to modified Raman\nprocesses involving the optical phonon mode at 125 cm$^{-1}$. The relaxation at\nhigher temperature goes through a first excited level of the $^{2}$F$_{5/2}$\nterm at about $\\hbar \\omega \\approx 228$ cm$^{-1}$. Effects provided by the\nhyperfine interaction of the Ce$^{3+}$ with the $^{27}$Al nuclei are observed.\n", "  We develop an intensive embedding for visualizing the space of all\npredictions for probabalistic models, using replica theory. Our embedding is\nisometric (preserves the distinguishability between models) and faithful\n(yields low-dimensional visualizations of models with simple emergent\nbehavior). We apply our intensive embedding to the Ising model of statistical\nmechanics and the $\\Lambda$CDM model applied to cosmic microwave background\nradiation. It provides an intuitive, quantitative visualization applicable to\nrenormalization-group calculations and optimal experimental design.\n", "  Inducing magnetism into topological insulators is intriguing for utilizing\nexotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) for\ntechnological applications. While most studies have focused on doping magnetic\nimpurities to open a gap at the surface-state Dirac point, many undesirable\neffects have been reported to appear in some cases that makes it difficult to\ndetermine whether the gap opening is due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking\nor not. Furthermore, the realization of the QAHE has been limited to low\ntemperatures. Here we have succeeded in generating a massive Dirac cone in a\nMnBi2Se4 /Bi2Se3 heterostructure which was fabricated by self-assembling a\nMnBi2Se4 layer on top of the Bi2Se3 surface as a result of the co-deposition of\nMn and Se. Our experimental results, supported by relativistic ab initio\ncalculations, demonstrate that the fabricated MnBi2Se4 /Bi2Se3 heterostructure\nshows ferromagnetism up to room temperature and a clear Dirac-cone gap opening\nof ~100 meV without any other significant changes in the rest of the band\nstructure. It can be considered as a result of the direct interaction of the\nsurface Dirac cone and the magnetic layer rather than a magnetic proximity\neffect. This spontaneously formed self-assembled heterostructure with a massive\nDirac spectrum, characterized by a nontrivial Chern number C = -1, has a\npotential to realize the QAHE at significantly higher temperatures than\nreported up to now and can serve as a platform for developing future \"\ntopotronics\" devices.\n", "  Cobalt-based alloys with {\\gamma}/{\\gamma}' microstructures have the\npotential to become the next generation of superalloys, but alloy compositions\nand processing steps must be optimized to improve coarsening, creep, and\nrafting behavior. While these behaviors are different than in nickel-based\nsuperalloys, alloy development can be accelerated by understanding the\nthermodynamic factors influencing microstructure evolution. In this work, we\ndevelop a phase field model informed by first-principles density functional\ntheory and experimental data to predict the equilibrium shapes of Co-Al-W\n{\\gamma}' precipitates. Three-dimensional simulations of single and multiple\nprecipitates are performed to understand the effect of elastic and interfacial\nenergy on coarsened and rafted microstructures; the elastic energy is dependent\non the elastic stiffnesses, misfit strain, precipitate size, applied stress,\nand precipitate spatial distribution. We observe characteristic microstructures\ndependent on the type of applied stress that have the same {\\gamma}' morphology\nand orientation seen in experiments, indicating that the elastic stresses\narising from coherent {\\gamma}/{\\gamma}' interfaces are important for\nmorphological evolution during creep. The results also indicate that the narrow\n{\\gamma} channels between {\\gamma}' precipitates are energetically favored, and\nprovide an explanation for the experimentally observed directional coarsening\nthat occurs without any applied stress.\n", "  We investigate the size scaling of the macroscopic fracture strength of\nheterogeneous materials when microscopic disorder is controlled by fat-tailed\ndistributions. We consider a fiber bundle model where the strength of single\nfibers is described by a power law distribution over a finite range. Tuning the\namount of disorder by varying the power law exponent and the upper cutoff of\nfibers' strength, in the limit of equal load sharing an astonishing size effect\nis revealed: For small system sizes the bundle strength increases with the\nnumber of fibers and the usual decreasing size effect of heterogeneous\nmaterials is only restored beyond a characteristic size. We show analytically\nthat the extreme order statistics of fibers' strength is responsible for this\npeculiar behavior. Analyzing the results of computer simulations we deduce a\nscaling form which describes the dependence of the macroscopic strength of\nfiber bundles on the parameters of microscopic disorder over the entire range\nof system sizes.\n", "  The outer Galactic halo is home to a number of substructures which still have\nan uncertain origin, but most likely are remnants of former interactions\nbetween the Galaxy and its former satellites. Triangulum-Andromeda (TriAnd) is\none of these halo substructures, found as an overdensity of 2MASS M giants. We\nanalyzed the region of Triangulum-Andromeda using photometric data from the\nNinth Data Release of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR9). By comparing the\nobservations with simulations from the TRILEGAL Galactic model, we were able to\nidentify and map several scattered overdensities of main sequence stars that\nseem to be associated with TriAnd over a large area covering $\\sim 500$\ndeg$^2$. One of these excesses may represent a new stellar overdensity. We also\nbriefly discuss an alternative hypothesis, according to which TriAnd is one of\nthe troughs of oscillation rings in the Galactic disk.\n", "  By associating a binary signal with the relativistic worldline of a particle,\na binary form of the phase of non-relativistic wavefunctions is naturally\nproduced by time dilation. An analog of superposition also appears as a Lorentz\nfiltering process, removing paths that are relativistically inequivalent. In a\nmodel that includes a stochastic component, the free-particle Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation emerges from a completely relativistic context in which its origin\n{\\em and function} is known. The result establishes the fact that the phase of\nwavefunctions in Schr\\\"{o}dinger's equation and the attendant superposition\nprinciple may both be considered remnants of time dilation. This strongly\nargues that quantum mechanics has its origins in special relativity.\n", "  The problem of practical preparing small impedance particles with a\nprescribed boundary impedance is formulated and its importance in physics and\ntechnology is discussed. It is shown that if this problem is solved then one\ncan easily prepare materials with a desired refraction coefficient and\nmaterials with a desired radiation pattern.\n", "  The renormalization method based on the Newton-Maclaurin expansion is applied\nto study the transient behavior of the solutions to the difference equations as\nthey tend to the steady-states. The key and also natural step is to make the\nrenormalization equations to be continuous such that the elementary functions\ncan be used to describe the transient behavior of the solutions to difference\nequations. As the concrete examples, we deal with the important second order\nnonlinear difference equations with a small parameter. The result shows that\nthe method is more natural than the multi-scale method.\n", "  We study the influence of measured high cumulants of conserved charges on\ntheir associated statistical uncertainties in relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions. With a given number of events, the measured cumulants randomly\nfluctuate with an approximately normal distribution, while the estimated\nstatistical uncertainties are found to be correlated with corresponding values\nof the obtained cumulants. Generally, with a given number of events, the larger\nthe cumulants we measure, the larger the statistical uncertainties that are\nestimated. The error-weighted averaged cumulants are dependent on statistics.\nDespite this effect, however, it is found that the three sigma rule of thumb is\nstill applicable when the statistics are above one million.\n", "  It is very interesting to bring plasmonic circular dichroism spectroscopy to\nthe mid-infrared spectral interval, and there are two reasons for this. This\nspectral interval is very important for thermal bio-imaging and,\nsimultaneously, this spectral range includes vibrational lines of many chiral\nbiomolecules. Here we demonstrate that graphene plasmons indeed offer such\nopportunity. In particular, we show that chiral graphene assemblies consisting\nof a few graphene nanodisks can generate strong circular dichroism (CD) in the\nmid-infrared interval. The CD signal is generated due to the plasmon-plasmon\ncoupling between adjacent nanodisks in the specially designed chiral graphene\nassemblies. Because of the large dimension mismatch between the thickness of a\ngraphene layer and the incoming light's wavelength, three-dimensional\nconfigurations with a total height of a few hundred nanometers are necessary to\nobtain a strong CD signal in the mid-infrared range. The mid-infrared CD\nstrength is mainly governed by the total dimensions (total height and helix\nscaffold radius) of the graphene nanodisk assembly, and by the plasmon-plasmon\ninteraction strength between its constitutive nanodisks. Both positive and\nnegative CD bands can be observed in the graphene assembly array. The frequency\ninterval of the plasmonic CD spectra overlaps with the vibrational modes of\nsome important biomolecules, such as DNA and many different peptides, giving\nrise to the possibility of enhancing the vibrational optical activity of these\nmolecular species by attaching them to the graphene assemblies. Simultaneously\nthe spectral range of chiral mid-infrared plasmons in our structures appears\nnear the typical wavelength of the human-body thermal radiation and, therefore,\nour chiral metastructures can be potentially utilized as optical components in\nthermal imaging devices.\n", "  The topological morphology--order of zeros at the positions of electrons with\nrespect to a specific electron--of Laughlin state at filling fractions $1/m$\n($m$ odd) is homogeneous as every electron feels zeros of order $m$ at the\npositions of other electrons. Although fairly accurate ground state wave\nfunctions for most of the other quantum Hall states in the lowest Landau level\nare quite well-known, it had been an open problem in expressing the ground\nstate wave functions in terms of flux-attachment to particles, {\\em a la}, this\nmorphology of Laughlin state. With a very general consideration of\nflux-particle relations only, in spherical geometry, we here report a novel\nmethod for determining morphologies of these states. Based on these, we\nconstruct almost exact ground state wave-functions for the Coulomb interaction.\nAlthough the form of interaction may change the ground state wave-function, the\nsame morphology constructs the latter irrespective of the nature of the\ninteraction between electrons.\n", "  We investigate the relation of $a^\\dagger a$ terms in the collective operator\nto the higher-order terms in the adiabatic self-consistent collective\ncoordinate (ASCC) method. In the ASCC method, a state vector is written as\n$e^{i\\hat G(q,p,n)}|\\phi(q)\\rangle$ with $\\hat G(q,p,n)$ which is a function of\ncollective coordinate $q$, its conjugate momentum $p$ and the particle number\n$n$. According to the generalized Thouless theorem, $\\hat G$ can be written as\na linear combination of two-quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators\n$a^\\dagger_\\mu a^\\dagger_\\nu$ and $a_\\nu a_\\mu$. We show that, if $a^\\dagger a$\nterms are included in $\\hat G(q,p,n)$, it corresponds to the higher-order terms\nin the adiabatic expansion of $\\hat G$. This relation serves as a prescription\nto determine the higher-order collective operators from the $a^\\dagger a$ part\nof the collective operator, once it is given without solving the higher-order\nequations of motion.\n", "  Horizontal branch (HB) morphology is a complex multiple-parameter problem.\nBesides the metallicity, two other leading parameters are the mass loss rate\n(MLR) and the initial He abundance of the HB progenitors. Using the STAREV\nstellar evolution code, we produce a wide array of Extreme Horizontal Branch\n(EHB) stars and also examine their post-HB evolution. EHB stars are produced in\nour calculations by the so called `delayed (late) hot core flash' scenario. The\nMLR is increased on the red giant branch (RGB) to the extent that, prior to\nreaching core flash conditions, only a very thin H-rich envelope remains and\nhelium ignition takes place at hotter positions on the HRD. We perform an\nextensive, self-consistent parameter study, covering populations I and II\n(Z=0.0001-0.03), for both normal initial helium abundances and He-enriched\nmodels (up to Y=0.40). For completeness of the study and in order to point to\ncomplete trends, we chose NOT to cut out several combinations (or results of)\nthat may extend beyond realistic limits. We present results and complete\nevolutionary tracks for the covered parameter space, showing in particular\nthat: a) Increased He abundance ON ITS OWN -- without having a\nsignificant-enough MLR on the RGB -- DOES NOT lead to the production of EHB\nstars; however, b) The bluest (hottest) HB positions do result from the\nCOMBINED effect of He-enhancement and increased MLR; c) The general trend is\nthat the effective temperature on the HB increases with decreasing metallicity,\nbut there is an indication for a halt, or even a reversal of this trend, as Z\nfurther decreases below $10^{-3}$; d) EHB stars can serve as major contributors\nto the UV flux emanating from their host system. Thus, the present\ncomprehensive study both complements and lends support to previous, more\nrestricted studies of the HB phase, and adds results for unexplored regions of\nthe parameter space.\n", "  QCD sum rules are analytic predictions of hadron observables from quantum\nchromodynamics. In the so-called local-duality limit of their Borel-transformed\nform, all nonperturbative contributions are encompassed by just a single\nquantity, an effective threshold beyond which, by assumption, all hadronic\ncontributions are reliably described by perturbative QCD. Reconstructing its\nquark-mass dependence enables us to investigate the differences of the leptonic\ndecay constants of heavy-light mesons effectuated by the tiny isospin-violating\ndiscrepancy of the masses of up and down quarks. By and large, our findings\nenjoy excellent agreement with the outcomes of earlier studies, the only\nexception being a lattice-QCD prediction for the $B$ mesons, where we find\ndramatic disagreement.\n", "  A first-principles calculation has been performed to study elastic,\nelectronic, thermodynamic, transport and superconducting properties of recently\nreported osmium based two superconductors, XOsSi (X=Nb, Ta). We have calculated\nelastic constants and elastic moduli of XOsSi for the first time. The\ncalculated values of bulk, Youngs, shear moduli are reasonably larger than the\naverage value obtained from the rule of mixtures of the constituents. NbOsSi\nand TaOsSi both compounds are found to be relatively hard material, elastically\nstable and ductile in nature. The obtained directional bulk modulus and shear\nanisotropic factors indicate that both compounds have high elastic anisotropy.\nThe shear anisotropic factors show higher elastic anisotropy than the\npercentage anisotropy in these compounds. The Debye temperature and bulk\nmodulus increases with pressure but decreases with temperature as usual for\nmetals. The magnetic susceptibility of TaOsSi follow the Curie law but NaOsSi\ndo not follow due to its delocalized magnetic moment and electronic specific\nheat slightly deviates from the linear relationship with temperature. The\ncalculated band structures of XOsSi compounds show metallic nature. In both\ncases d-orbitals have the dominating contribution to the total density of\nstates. The smaller electron-phonon coupling constant implies that XOsSi (X=Nb,\nTa) are weakly coupled superconductors.\n", "  A decade ago, BES Collaboration reported the discovery of a new scalar\nisosinglet resonance denoted as $f_0(1790)$. The finding was subsequently\nconfirmed by LHCb. Recently, the existence of the corresponding isotriplet\nstate -- the $a_0(1950)$ resonance -- has been claimed by BABAR. We investigate\nwhether these resonances can be described as excited $\\bar{q}q$ states. To this\nend, a comprehensive Lagrangian containing ground-state $\\bar{q}q$ mesons as\nwell as their first excitations is constructed in accordance with symmetries of\nthe strong interaction. Both $f_0(1790)$ and $a_0(1950)$ emerge as compatible\nwith $\\bar{q}q$ excitations; however, tension appears to arise between the\nsimultaneous interpretation of $f_0(1790)$/$a_0(1950)$ and pseudoscalar mesons\n$\\eta(1295)$, $\\pi(1300)$, $\\eta(1440)$ and $K(1460)$ as excited $\\bar{q}q$\nstates.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are quickly becoming a subject of intense interest\nin time-domain astronomy. The progenitors of FRBs remain unknown but a wide\nvariety of models exist from cataclysmic to repeating scenarios. Advances in\nFRB detection using current and next-generation radio telescopes will enable\nthe growth of the population in the next few years. Real-time discovery of FRBs\nis now possible with 6 sources detected in real-time within the past 2 years at\nthe Parkes telescope. Here we discuss the developing strategies for maximising\nreal-time science with FRBs including polarisation capture and multi-wavelength\nfollow-up, with particular focus on real-time detections with the Parkes\ntelescope as a test bed for fast radio burst science. We also discuss how our\nresponse to these events can pave the way for the next generation of FRB\nsearches with wide-field interferometers.\n", "  The present thesis is devoted to the reconstruction of the dark energy models\nusing diverse observational data sets. The parametric approach has been adopted\nfor the reconstruction of cosmological models. The reconstruction of\nkinematical quantities and the possibility of interaction between dark energy\nand dark matter has also been emphasised. In first chapter, a brief\nintroduction to cosmology has been presented. In the second chapter, a\nreconstruction of the dark energy equation of state parameter for a\nquintessence scalar field model has been discussed. In the third chapter, a\nparametric reconstruction of the effective or total equation of state has been\ndiscussed. In the fourth chapter, a kinematic approach in the reconstruction of\ndark energy model through the parametrization of the cosmological jerk\nparameter has been discussed. The fifth chapter is also about a kinematic\napproach to the reconstruction of dark energy. The reconstruction has been done\nwith an assumption that the jerk parameter is a very slowly varying function.\nThe sixth chapter is devoted to the reconstruction of the interaction rate in\nholographic dark energy model. Finally, chapter seven contains the concluding\nremarks and relevant discussions regarding the overall work presented in the\nthesis.\n", "  The detection of thousands of extrasolar planets by the transit method\nnaturally raises the question of whether potential extrasolar observers could\ndetect the transits of the Solar System planets. We present a comprehensive\nanalysis of the regions in the sky from where transit events of the Solar\nSystem planets can be detected. We specify how many different Solar System\nplanets can be observed from any given point in the sky, and find the maximum\nnumber to be three. We report the probabilities of a randomly positioned\nexternal observer to be able to observe single and multiple Solar System planet\ntransits; specifically, we find a probability of 2.518% to be able to observe\nat least one transiting planet, 0.229% for at least two transiting planets, and\n0.027% for three transiting planets. We identify 68 known exoplanets that have\na favourable geometric perspective to allow transit detections in the Solar\nSystem and we show how the ongoing K2 mission will extend this list. We use\noccurrence rates of exoplanets to estimate that there are $3.2\\pm1.2$ and\n$6.6^{+1.3}_{-0.8}$ temperate Earth-sized planets orbiting GK and M dwarf stars\nbrighter than $V=13$ and $V=16$ respectively, that are located in the Earth's\ntransit zone.\n", "  The Venusian atmosphere is in a state of superrotation where prevailing\nwestward winds move much faster than the planet's rotation. Venus is covered\nwith thick clouds that extend from about 45 to 70 km altitude, but thermal\nradiation emitted from the lower atmosphere and the surface on the planet's\nnightside escapes to space at narrow spectral windows of the near-infrared. The\nradiation can be used to estimate winds by tracking the silhouettes of clouds\nin the lower and middle cloud regions below about 57 km in altitude. Estimates\nof wind speeds have ranged from 50 to 70 m/s at low to mid-latitudes, either\nnearly constant across latitudes or with winds peaking at mid-latitudes. Here\nwe report the detection of winds at low latitude exceeding 80 m/s using IR2\ncamera images from the Akatsuki orbiter taken during July and August 2016. The\nangular speed around the planetary rotation axis peaks near the equator, which\nwe suggest is consistent with an equatorial jet, a feature that has not been\nobserved previously in the Venusian atmosphere. The mechanism producing the jet\nremains unclear. Our observations reveal variability in the zonal flow in the\nlower and middle cloud region that may provide clues to the dynamics of Venus's\natmospheric superrotation.\n", "  The $P_5'$ anomaly uncovered by the LHCb experiment in $B \\to K^*\\mu\\mu$\nangular observables has motivated a possible $Z'$ boson that couples to\nleft-handed $b \\to s$ transitions, where a model would be gauged $L_\\mu -\nL_\\tau$ symmetry, but direct search for such a $Z'$ is not promising. Less\nconstrained is an analogous $Z'$ coupling to right-handed $t \\to c$\ntransitions. Motivated by this, we study $cg \\to tZ'$ associated production at\nLHC, both for a generic model, and in $L_\\mu - L_\\tau$ with a vector-like U\nquark. We also study $c\\bar c \\to Z'$ production that exists within the model.\nBoth processes can be probed already with LHC Run 2 data, all the way up to the\nHL-LHC with discovery potential.\n", "  We discuss a scenario of short Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) following a merger of\na massive ONeMg white dwarf (WD) with a CO WD, and an ensuing accretion induced\ncollapse (AIC). An initial system with the primary mass $M_1 \\sim 6-10 \\,\nM_\\odot$ and the secondary mass $M_2 \\sim 3-6\\, M_\\odot$ forms, via two\ndistinct evolutionary channels, a double degenerate CO-ONeMg WD system. For\nsufficiently large mass ratio $q \\equiv M_2/M_1 > q_{crit} \\sim 0.25$ the\nensuing gravitational wave-driven mass transfer is unstable, whereby the less\nmassive CO WD is disrupted and transfers its mass to the primary ONeMg WD on a\nfew orbital time scales. The merger product ignites shell CO burning, adding\nmass to the degenerate core; at the same time mass and angular momentum is lost\ndue to powerful winds. For an ONeMg WD sufficiently close to the Chandrasekhar\nmass an electron-capture accretion induced collapse (AIC) follows $\\sim 10^4$\nyears afterwards. We associate the prompt short GRB emission with a direct\ncollapse of an ONeMg WD to a neutron star, without formation of an accretion\ndisk. After the collapse the accretion of the unburnt part of the shell onto\nthe newly formed NS powers the extended emission (EE). During the collapse the\nneutron star is spun to millisecond periods and produce long lasting\nrelativistic winds that shock against the material lost during the\nshell-burning stage, and produce afterglow emission from the wind termination\nshock.\n", "  Halogen bonding (X-bonding) has attracted notable attention among noncovalent\ninteractions. This highly directional attraction between a halogen atom and an\nelectron donor has been exploited in knowledge-based drug design. A great deal\nof information has been gathered about X-bonds in protein-ligand complexes, as\nopposed to nucleic acid complexes. Here we provide a thorough analysis of\nnucleic acid complexes containing either halogenated building blocks or\nhalogenated ligands. We analyzed close contacts between halogens and\nelectron-rich moieties. The phosphate backbone oxygen is clearly the most\ncommon halogen acceptor. We identified 21 X-bonds within known structures of\nnucleic acid complexes. A vast majority of the X-bonds is formed by halogenated\nnucleobases, such as bromouridine, and feature excellent geometries.\nNoncovalent ligands have been found to form only interactions with suboptimal\ninteraction geometries. Hence, the first X-bonded nucleic acid binder remains\nto be discovered.\n", "  An interaction of electromagnetic S-wave with thin flat metallic film is\nnumerically studied for the quantum degenerate electron plasma. One considers\nthe reflectance, transmittance and absorptance power coefficients. A\ncontribution of quantum wave properties of electrons to the power coefficients\nis shown in comparison of the coefficients with ones evaluated for both the\nclassical spatial dispersion and the Drude - Lorentz approaches. This\ncontribution is detected for the infrared and terahertz frequencies in case of\nnanoscale film width.\n", "  The present paper describes in situ preparation of Ni{\\deg} nanoparticles\nimmobilized on acid activated montmorillonite K10 (Ni{\\deg}-Mont) by\nimpregnation of Ni(OAc)2 into nanopores of acid activated montmorillonite K10\nfollowed by polyol reduction. Ni{\\deg} NPs was highly dispersed into the\ninitiated mesopores on the surface or inside swelled-interlayers of the\nexamined clay with average size of 10-20 nm. Acid treatment of montmorillonite\nwas carried out with HCl (4 M) under controlled conditions for generation of\nthe desired pore sizes as a host of Ni{\\deg} NPs. The prepared Ni{\\deg}-Mont\nwas used as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for one-pot synthesis of\nbiscoumarins in 85-95% yields. The reactions were carried out via Knoevenagel\ncondensation of aromatic aldehydes with 4-hydroxycoumarin under microwave\nirradiation. The Ni{\\deg}-Mont catalyst was reused at least for seven times\nwithout significant loss of its catalytic activity.\n", "  Three-dimensional, Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) simulations are presented\nof the interaction between neutron superfluid vortices and proton\nsuperconductor flux tubes in a rotating, harmonic trap, representing an\nidealised model of the outer core of a neutron star. Low-energy states of the\nneutron condensate are calculated by evolving the GPE in imaginary time in the\npresence of a prescribed, static, rectilinear flux tube array. The calculations\nare carried out as a function of the angle between the global magnetic and\nrotation axes, and the amplitude and sign of the current-current and density\ncouplings between the neutron and proton condensates. It is found that the\nsystem is frustrated by the competition between vortex-vortex repulsion and\nvortex-flux-tube attraction (pinning), leading to the formation of vortex\ntangles and \"glassy\" behaviour characterized by multiple metastable states\nspaced closely in energy. The dimensionless parameters in the simulations are\nordered as one expects in a neutron star, but the dynamic range is many orders\nof magnitude smaller than in reality, so caution must be exercised when\nassessing the astrophysical implications. Nevertheless the results suggest that\ntangled vorticity may be endemic in neutron star outer cores.\n", "  Without exceeding the limits of the conventional $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm, we\nargue for Yukawa law of interparticle interaction as the law of gravitation in\nthe real expanding inhomogeneous Universe. It covers the whole space and comes\nup to take place of Newtonian gravity, which is restricted exclusively to\nsub-horizon distances. The large-scale screening of gravitational interaction\nbetween every two nonrelativistic massive particles is ensured by the\nhomogeneous cosmological background (specifically, by the nonzero average rest\nmass density of nonrelativistic matter). We take advantage of the uniform\nmatter distribution case (i.e. the homogeneous Universe limit) to demonstrate\nsuperiority of Yukawa gravity. Attention is also devoted to the concrete\nparticular case of inhomogeneity.\n", "  We delineate an ab initio approach for obtaining x-ray absorption spectra as\nprovided by many-body perturbation theory, together with its realization within\nan all-electron framework. Employing the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we address\nexcitations from different absorption edges in a broad range of material\nclasses, analyzing exciton binding strengths and character. We also discuss\nwhen the supercell core-hole approach is likely to fail.\n", "  Magnetic thin films at ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) leak angular momentum,\nwhich may be absorbed by adjacent layers. This phenomenon, known as spin\npumping, is manifested by an increase in the resonance linewidth ($\\Delta H$),\nand the closely related Gilbert damping. Another effect of this transfer of\nspin currents is a dynamical and long-range coupling that can drive two\nmagnetic layers into a collective precession when their FMR frequencies\ncoincide. A collective behavior is also found in magnetic trilayers with\ninterlayer exchange coupling (IEC). In this study we investigate the interplay\nbetween IEC and spin pumping, using Co/Cu/Py pseudo-spin values. We employ\nbroadband FMR spectroscopy to explore both the frequency and coupling-strength\ndependence of $\\Delta H$. Our observations show that there exists a cut-off\nfrequency, set by the IEC strength, below which the precession is truly\ncollective and the spin pumping is suppressed. These results demonstrate that\nit is possible to control the spin pumping efficiency by varying the frequency\nor the interlayer exchange coupling.\n", "  We present a summary of the current status of searches for dark matter at the\nLHC from the ATLAS and CMS experiments. For various assumptions in the\nsimplified parameter space, the LHC exclusions is complementary to direct\ndetection results. Mono-object analyses in search of dark matter and various\nanalyses searching for dark matter mediators are presented.\n", "  The deposition process at the edge of evaporating colloidal drops varies with\nthe shape of suspended particles. Experiments with prolate ellipsoidal\nparticles suggest that the spatiotemporal properties of the deposit depend\nstrongly on particle aspect ratio. As the aspect ratio increases, the particles\nform less densely-packed deposits and the statistical behavior of the deposit\ninterface crosses over from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class to\nanother universality class which was suggested to be consistent with the KPZ\nplus quenched disorder. Here, we numerically study the effect of particle\ninteraction anisotropy on deposit growth. In essence, we model the ellipsoids,\nat the interface, as disk-like particles with two types of interaction patches\nthat correspond to specific features at the poles and equator of the ellipsoid.\nThe numerical results corroborate experimental observations and further suggest\nthat the deposition transition can stem from interparticle interaction\nanisotropy. Possible extensions of our model to other systems are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We report the existence of topologically charged nodal surface, a band\ndegeneracy on a two-dimensional surface in momentum space that is topologically\ncharged. We develop a Hamiltonian for such charged nodal surface, and show that\nsuch a Hamiltonian can be implemented in a tight-binding model as well as in an\nacoustic meta-material. We also identify a topological phase transition,\nthrough which the charges of the nodal surface changes by absorbing or emitting\nan integer number of Weyl points. Our result indicates that in the band theory,\ntopologically charged objects are not restrict to zero dimension as in a Weyl\npoint, and thus pointing to previously unexplored opportunities for the design\nof topological materials.\n", "  Swarming of animal groups enthralls scientists in fields ranging from biology\nto physics to engineering. Complex swarming patterns often arise from simple\ninteractions between individuals to the benefit of the collective whole. The\nexistence and success of swarming, however, nontrivially depend on microscopic\nparameters governing the interactions. Here we show that a machine-learning\ntechnique can be employed to tune these underlying parameters and optimize the\nresulting performance. As a concrete example, we take an active matter model\ninspired by schools of golden shiners, which collectively conduct phototaxis.\nThe problem of optimizing the phototaxis capability is then mapped to that of\nmaximizing benefits in a continuum-armed bandit game. The latter problem\naccepts a simple reinforcement-learning algorithm, which can tune the\ncontinuous parameters of the model. This result suggests the utility of\nmachine-learning methodology in swarm-robotics applications.\n"]}
