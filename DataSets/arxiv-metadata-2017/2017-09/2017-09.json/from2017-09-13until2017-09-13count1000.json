identical particles packed on spheres has\nrelevance for stabilizing emulsions and a venerable history in the literature\nof theoretical physics and mathematics. Theory and experiment have confirmed\nthat defects such as disclinations and dislocations are an intrinsic part of\nthe ground state. Here we discuss the remarkable behavior of vacancies and\ninterstitials in spherical crystals. The strain fields of isolated\ndisclinations forced in by the spherical topology literally rip interstitials\nand vacancies apart, typically into dislocation fragments that combine with the\ndisclinations to create small grain boundary scars. The fractionation is often\ninto three charge-neutral dislocations, although dislocation pairs can be\ncreated as well. We use a powerful, freely available computer program to\nexplore interstitial fractionalization in some detail, for a variety of power\nlaw pair potentials. We investigate the dependence on initial conditions and\nthe final state energies, and compare the position dependence of interstitial\nenergies with the predictions of continuum elastic theory on the sphere. The\ntheory predicts that, before fragmentation, interstitials are repelled from\n5-fold disclinations and vacancies are attracted. We also use vacancies and\ninterstitials to study low energy states in the vicinity of \"magic numbers\"\nthat accommodate regular icosadeltahedral tessellations.\n", "  We analyze the performance of two different core-hole potentials in the\ntheoretical modeling of XAS of ice, liquid and gas phase water; the use of a\nfull core-hole (FCH) in the calculations, as suggested by Hetenyi et al. [J.\nChem. Phys. 120 (18), 8632 (2004)], gives poor agreement with experiment in\nterms of intensity distribution as well as transition energies, while the half\ncore hole (HCH) potential, in the case of water, provides a better compromise\nbetween initial and final state effects, leading to good agreement with the\nexperimental data.\n", "  Predicting which crystalline modifications can be present in a chemical\nsystem requires the global exploration of its energy landscape. Due to the\nlarge computational effort involved, in the past this search for sufficiently\nstable minima has been performed employing a variety of empirical potentials\nand cost functions followed by a local optimization on the ab initio level.\nHowever, this entails the risk of overlooking important modifications that are\nnot modeled accurately using empirical potentials. In order to overcome this\ncritical limitation, we develop an approach to employ ab initio energy\nfunctions during the global optimization phase of the structure prediction. As\nan example, we perform a global exploration of the landscape of LiF on the ab\ninitio level and show that the relevant crystalline modifications are found\nduring the search.\n", "  Geometry, electronic structure, and magnetic properties of TMNan (TM=Cr-Ni; n\n= 4-7) clusters are studied within a gradient corrected density functional\ntheory (DFT) framework. Two complementary approaches, the first adapted to\nall-electron calculations on free clusters, and the second been on plane wave\nprojector augmented wave (PAW) method within a supercell approach are used.\nExcept for NiNan, the clusters in this series are found to retain the atomic\nmoments of the TM atoms, and the magnetic moment presented an odd-even\noscillation with respect to the number of Na atoms. The origin of these\nodd-even oscillations is explained from the nature of chemical bonding in these\nclusters. Differences and similarities between the chemical bonding and the\nmagnetic properties of these clusters and the TMNan (TM = Sc, V and Ti; n =\n4-6) clusters on one hand, and TM-doped Au and Ag clusters on the other hand,\nare discussed.\n", "  We theoretically design a graphene-based all-organic ferromagnetic\nsemiconductor by terminating zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) with organic\nmagnets. A large spin-split gap with 100% spin polarized density of states near\nthe Fermi energy is obtained, which is of potential application in spin\ntransistors. The interplays among electron, spin and lattice degrees of freedom\nare studied using the first-principles calculations combined with fundamental\nmodel analysis. All of the calculations consistently demonstrate that although\nno d electrons existing, the antiferromagnetic \\pi-\\pi exchange together with\nthe strong spin-lattice interactions between organic magnets and ZGNRs make the\nground state ferromagnetic. The fundamental physics makes it possible to\noptimally select the organic magnets towards practical applications.\n", "  Atoms in highly excited Rydberg states exhibit remarkable properties and\nconstitute a powerful tool for studying quantum phenomena in strongly\ninteracting many-particle systems. We investigate alkali atoms that are held in\na ring lattice and excited to Rydberg states. The system constitutes an ideal\nmodel system to study thermalization of a coherently evolving quantum\nmany-particle system in the absence of a thermal bath. Moreover, it offers\nexciting perspective to create entangled many-body quantum states which can\nserve as a resource for the generation of single photons.\n", "  We present the first experimental observation of cold collisions between two\ndifferent species of neutral polar molecules, each prepared in a single\ninternal quantum state. Combining for the first time the techniques of Stark\ndeceleration, magnetic trapping, and cryogenic buffer gas cooling allows the\nenhancement of molecular interaction time by 10$^5$. This has enabled an\nabsolute measurement of the total trap loss cross sections between OH and\nND$_3$ at a mean collision energy of 3.6 cm$^{-1}$ (5 K). Due to the dipolar\ninteraction, the total cross section increases upon application of an external\npolarizing electric field. Cross sections computed from \\emph{ab initio}\npotential energy surfaces are in excellent agreement with the measured value at\nzero external electric field. The theory presented here represents the first\nsuch analysis of collisions between a $^2\\Pi$ radical and a closed-shell\npolyatomic molecule.\n", "  Motivated by experimentally observed biocompatibility enhancement of\nnanoengineered cubic zirconia ZrO2 coatings to mesenchymal stromal cells, we\nhave carried out computational analysis of the initial immobilization of one of\nknown structural fragment of the adhesive protein (fibronectin) on the\ncorresponding surface. We constructed an atomistic model of the zirconia\nnano-hillock of 3-fold symmetry based on AFM and TEM images. First-principle\nquantum-mechanical calculations show a substantial variation of electrostatic\npotential at the hillock due to the presence of surface features such as edges\nand vertexes. Using an implemented Monte Carlo simulated annealing method we\nfound the orientation of the immobilized protein on the zirconia surface (both\nflat and nanostructured) and contribution of the each amino acid residue from\nthe protein sequence to the adsorption energy. Accounting for the variation of\nthe dielectric permittivity at the protein-implant interface we use a model\ndistance-dependent dielectric function to describe the inter-atom electrostatic\n(Coulomb) interactions in the adsorption potential. We find that the initial\nimmobilization of the rigid protein fragment on the nanostructured pyramidal\nZrO2 surface is achieved with magnitude of adsorption energy larger than the\none for the protein on the smooth (flat) surface. The strong attractive\nelectrostatic interactions are a major factor in the enhanced adsorption at\nnanostructured surface that is absent in the case of adsorption on the flat\nuncharged surface. We show that the best electrostatic and steric fit of the\nprotein to the inorganic surface corresponds to a minimum of the adsorption\nenergy determined by the non-covalent interactions.\n", "  Anomalous diffusion has been widely observed by single particle tracking\nmicroscopy in complex systems such as biological cells. The resulting time\nseries are usually evaluated in terms of time averages. Often anomalous\ndiffusion is connected with non-ergodic behaviour. In such cases the time\naverages remain random variables and hence irreproducible. Here we present a\ndetailed analysis of the time averaged mean squared displacement for systems\ngoverned by anomalous diffusion, considering both unconfined and restricted\n(corralled) motion. We discuss the behaviour of the time averaged mean squared\ndisplacement for two prominent stochastic processes, namely, continuous time\nrandom walks and fractional Brownian motion. We also study the distribution of\nthe time averaged mean squared displacement around its ensemble mean, and show\nthat this distribution preserves typical process characteristic even for short\ntime series. Recently, velocity correlation functions were suggested to\ndistinguish between these processes. We here present analytucal expressions for\nthe velocity correlation functions. Knowledge of the results presented here are\nexpected to be relevant for the correct interpretation of single particle\ntrajectory data in complex systems.\n", "  Reactive cross-sections for the collision of open shell S(^1D) atoms with\northo- and para-hydrogen, in the kinetic energy range 1-120 K, have been\ncalculated using the hyperspherical quantum reactive scattering method\ndeveloped by Launay et al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 169, 473 (1990)]. Short-range\ninteractions, described using the {\\em ab initio} potential energy surface by\nHo et al. were complemented with an accurate description of the long-range\ninteractions, where the main electrostatic (~R^{-5}) and dispersion (~ R^{-6})\ncontributions were considered. This allows the comparison with recent\nexperimental measurements of rate constants and excitation functions for the\ntitle reaction at low temperatures [Berteloite et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2010].\nThe agreement is fairly good. The behavior in the considered energy range can\nbe understood on the average in terms of a classical Langevin (capture) model,\nwhere the centrifugal barriers determine the amount of reactive flux which\nreaches the barrierless transition state. Additionally, the structure of the\nvan der Waals well provides temporal trapping at short distances thus allowing\nthe system to find its way to the reaction at some classically-forbidden\nenergies. Interestingly, the cross-section for para-hydrogen shows clearly\noscillating features associated to the opening of new partial waves and to\nshape resonances which may be amenable to experimental detection.\n", "  The vibrational wave-packet dynamics of diatomic rubidium molecules (Rb2) in\ntriplet states formed on the surface of superfluid helium nanodroplets is\ninvestigated both experimentally and theoretically. Detailed comparison of\nexperimental femtosecond pump-probe spectra with dissipative quantum dynamics\nsimulations reveals that vibrational relaxation is the main source of\ndephasing. The rate constant for vibrational relaxation in the first excited\ntriplet state is found to be constant ~0.5ns^-1 for the lowest vibrational\nlevels v< 15 and to increase sharply when exciting to higher energies.\n", "  We propose a scheme for ultrafast real-time imaging of laser-induced\ncollective electron oscillations (Mie plasmons) in gas phase metal clusters by\ninterferometrically stable scanning of two intense few-cycle optical laser\npulses. The feasibility of our nonlinear spectral interferometry method with\nexperimentally accessible observables is tested in a theoretical case study on\nsimple-metal clusters (Na$_{147}$). The results show that the plasmon period\nand lifetime as well as the phase and relative amplitude of the collective\nelectron motion can be extracted with sub-fs resolution. The access to\nnonlinear response effects, as the demonstrated increase of the plasmon\nlifetime with laser intensity due to ionization-induced contraction of the\nelectron cloud, opens up vast opportunities for interrogating ultrafast\nmany-particle dynamics in nanosystems under strong laser fields with\nunprecedented resolution.\n", "  We realize a biochemical filtering process by introducing a buffer in a\nbiocatalytic signal-transduction logic system based on the function of an\nenzyme, esterase. The input, ethyl butyrate, is converted into butyric acid-the\noutput signal, which in turn is measured by the drop in the pH value. The\ndeveloped approach offers a versatile \"network element\" for increasing the\ncomplexity of biochemical information processing systems. Evaluation of an\noptimal regime for quality filtering is accomplished in the framework of a\nkinetic rate-equation model.\n", "  The morphology of water ice in the interstellar medium is still an open\nquestion. Although accretion of gaseous water could not be the only possible\norigin of the observed icy mantles covering dust grains in cold molecular\nclouds, it is well known that water accreted from the gas phase on surfaces\nkept at 10 K forms ice films that exhibit a very high porosity. It is also\nknown that in the dark clouds H2 formation occurs on the icy surface of dust\ngrains and that part of the energy (4.48 eV) released when adsorbed atoms react\nto form H2 is deposited in the ice. The experimental study described in the\npresent work focuses on how relevant changes of the ice morphology result from\natomic hydrogen exposure and subsequent recombination. Using the\ntemperature-programmed desorption (TPD) technique and a method of inversion\nanalysis of TPD spectra, we show that there is an exponential decrease in the\nporosity of the amorphous water ice sample following D-atom irradiation. This\ndecrease is inversely proportional to the thickness of the ice and has a value\nof Phi_0 = 2 x 10^16 D-atoms/cm^2 per layer of H2O. We also use a model which\nconfirms that the binding sites on the porous ice are destroyed regardless of\ntheir energy depth, and that the reduction of the porosity corresponds in fact\nto a reduction of the effective area. This reduction appears to be compatible\nwith the fraction of D2 formation energy transferred to the porous ice network.\nUnder interstellar conditions, this effect is likely to be efficient and,\ntogether with other compaction processes, provides a good argument to believe\nthat interstellar ice is amorphous and non-porous.\n", "  The electronic structure and magnetic properties of the graphene/Fe/Ni(111)\nsystem were investigated via combination of the density functional theory\ncalculations and electron-spectroscopy methods. This system was prepared via\nintercalation of thin Fe layer (1 ML) underneath graphene on Ni(111) and its\ninert properties were verified by means of photoelectron spectroscopy.\nIntercalation of iron in the space between graphene and Ni(111) changes\ndrastically the magnetic response from the graphene layer that is explained by\nthe formation of the highly spin-polarized $3d_{z^2}$ quantum-well state in the\nthin iron layer.\n", "  Cryogenically cooled buffer gas beam sources of the molecule thorium monoxide\n(ThO) are optimized and characterized. Both helium and neon buffer gas sources\nare shown to produce ThO beams with high flux, low divergence, low forward\nvelocity, and cold internal temperature for a variety of stagnation densities\nand nozzle diameters. The beam operates with a buffer gas stagnation density of\n~10^15-10^16 cm^-3 (Reynolds number ~1-100), resulting in expansion cooling of\nthe internal temperature of the ThO to as low as 2 K. For the neon (helium)\nbased source, this represents cooling by a factor of about 10 (2) from the\ninitial nozzle temperature of about 20 K (4 K). These sources deliver ~10^11\nThO molecules in a single quantum state within a 1-3 ms long pulse at 10 Hz\nrepetition rate. Under conditions optimized for a future precision spectroscopy\napplication [A C Vutha et al 2010 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 43 074007],\nthe neon-based beam has the following characteristics: forward velocity of 170\nm/s, internal temperature of 3.4 K, and brightness of 3x10^11 ground state\nmolecules per steradian per pulse. Compared to typical supersonic sources, the\nrelatively low stagnation density of this source, and the fact that the cooling\nmechanism relies only on collisions with an inert buffer gas, make it widely\napplicable to many atomic and molecular species, including those which are\nchemically reactive, such as ThO.\n", "  We demonstrate and characterize a cryogenic buffer gas-cooled molecular beam\nsource capable of producing bright beams of free radicals and refractory\nspecies. Details of the beam properties (brightness, forward velocity\ndistribution, transverse velocity spread, rotational and vibrational\ntemperatures) are measured under varying conditions for the molecular species\nSrF. Under typical conditions we produce a beam of brightness 1.2 x 10^11\nmolecules/sr/pulse in the rovibrational ground state, with 140 m/s forward\nvelocity and a rotational temperature of approximately 1 K. This source\ncompares favorably to other methods for producing beams of free radicals and\nrefractory species for many types of experiments. We provide details of\nconstruction that may be helpful for others attempting to use this method.\n", "  We introduce a new method to simulate the physics of rare events. The method,\nan extension of the Temperature Accelerated Molecular Dynamics, comes in use\nwhen the collective variables introduced to characterize the rare events are\neither non-analytical or so complex that computing their derivative is not\npractical. We illustrate the functioning of the method by studying the\nhomogeneous crystallization in a sample of Lennard-Jones particles. The process\nis studied by introducing a new collective variable that we call Effective\nNucleus Size $\\mathcal N$. We have computed the free energy barriers and the\nsize of critical nucleus, which result in agreement with data available in\nliterature. We have also performed simulations in the liquid domain of the\nphase diagram. We found a free energy curve monotonically growing with the\nnucleus size, consistent with the liquid domain.\n", "  The equilibrium electric double layer (EDL) that surrounds the colloidal\nparticles is determinant for the response of a suspension under a variety of\nstatic or alternating external fields. An ideal salt-free suspension is\ncomposed by the charged colloidal particles and the ionic countercharge\nreleased by the charging mechanism. The existing macroscopic theoretical models\ncan be improved by incorporating different ionic effects usually neglected in\nprevious mean-field approaches, which are based on the Poisson-Boltzmann\nequation (PB). The influence of the finite size of the ions seems to be quite\npromising because it has been shown to predict phenomena like charge reversal,\nwhich has been out of the scope of classical PB approximations. In this work we\nnumerically obtain the surface electric potential and the counterions\nconcentration profiles around a charged particle in a concentrated salt-free\nsuspension corrected by the finite size of the counterions. The results show\nthe large importance of such corrections for moderate to high particle charges\nat every particle volume fraction, specially, when a region of closest approach\nof the counterions to the particle surface is considered. We conclude that\nfinite ion size considerations are obeyed for the development of new\ntheoretical models to study nonequilibrium properties in concentrated colloidal\nsuspensions, particularly the salt-free ones with small and highly charged\nparticles.\n", "  The predissociation dynamics of the vibrationless level of the first Rydberg\nstate 6s (B 2E) state of CH3I has been studied by femtosecond-resolved velocity\nmap imaging of both the CH3 and I photofragments. The kinetic energy\ndistributions of the two fragments have been recorded as a function of the\npump-probe delay, and as a function of excitation within the umbrella and\nstretching vibrational modes of the CH3 fragment. These observations are made\nby using (2+1) Resonant Enhanced MultiPhoton Ionization (REMPI) via the 3pz\n2A2\" state of CH3 to detect specific vibrational levels of CH3. The vibrational\nbranching fractions of the CH3 are recovered by using the individual\nvibrationally state-selected CH3 distributions to fit the kinetic energy\ndistribution obtained by using nonresonant multiphoton ionization of either the\nI or CH3 fragment. The angular distributions and rise times of the two\nfragments differ significantly. These observations can be rationalized through\na consideration of the alignment of the CH3 fragment and the effect of this\nalignment on its detection efficiency. Two extra dissociation channels are\ndetected: one associated with Rydberg states near 9.2 eV that were observed\npreviously in photoelectron studies, and one associated with photodissociation\nof the parent cation around 15 eV.\n", "  The processes of ionization and energy transfer in a quantum system composed\nof two distant H atoms with an initial internuclear separation of 100 atomic\nunits (5.29 nm) have been studied by the numerical solution of the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation beyond the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation. Thereby it has been assumed that only one of the two H atoms was\nexcited by temporally and spatially shaped laser pulses at various laser\ncarrier frequencies. The quantum dynamics of the extended H-H system, which was\ntaken to be initially either in an unentangled or an entangled ground state,\nhas been explored within a linear three-dimensional model, including two z\ncoordinates of the electrons and the internuclear distance R. An efficient\nenergy transfer from the laser-excited H atom (atom A) to the other H atom\n(atom B) and the ionization of the latter have been found. It has been shown\nthat the physical mechanisms of the energy transfer as well as of the\nionization of atom B are the Coulomb attraction of the laser driven electron of\natom A by the proton of atom B and a short-range Coulomb repulsion of the two\nelectrons when their wave functions strongly overlap in the domain of atom B.\n", "  We use density-functional theory, of the fundamental-measure type, to study\nthe relative stability of the biaxial nematic phase, with respect to\nnon-uniform phases such as smectic and columnar, in fluids made of hard\nboard-like particles with sizes $\\sigma_1>\\sigma_2>\\sigma_3$. A\nrestricted-orientation (Zwanzig) approximation is adopted. Varying the ratio\n$\\kappa_1=\\sigma_1/\\sigma_2$ while keeping $\\kappa_2=\\sigma_2/\\sigma_3$, we\npredict phase diagrams for various values of $\\kappa_2$ which include all the\nuniform phases: isotropic, uniaxial rod- and plate-like nematics, and biaxial\nnematic. In addition, spinodal instabilities of the uniform phases with respect\nto fluctuations of the smectic, columnar and plastic-solid type, are obtained.\nIn agreement with recent experiments, we find that the biaxial nematic phase\nbegins to be stable for $\\kappa_2\\simeq 2.5$. Also, as predicted by previous\ntheories and simulations on biaxial hard particles, we obtain a region of\nbiaxility centred on $\\kappa_1\\approx\\kappa_2$ which widens as $\\kappa_2$\nincreases. For $\\kappa_2\\agt 5$ the region $\\kappa_2\\approx\\kappa_1$ of the\npacking-fraction vs. $\\kappa_1$ phase diagrams exhibits interesting topologies\nwhich change qualitatively with $\\kappa_2$. We have found that an increasing\nbiaxial shape anisotropy favours the formation of the biaxial nematic phase.\nOur study is the first to apply FMT theory to biaxial particles and, therefore,\nit goes beyond the second-order virial approximation. Our prediction that the\nphase diagram must be asymmetric is a genuine result of the present approach,\nwhich is not accounted for by previous studies based on second-order theories.\n", "  We simulate the nonequilibrium dynamics of two generic many-body quantum\nimpurity models by employing the recently developed iterative\ninfluence-functional path integral method [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 82}, 205323\n(2010)]. This general approach is presented here in the context of quantum\ntransport in molecular electronic junctions. Models of particular interest\ninclude the single impurity Anderson model and the related spinless two-state\nAnderson dot. In both cases we study the time evolution of the dot occupation\nand the current characteristics at finite temperature. A comparison to\nmean-field results is presented, when applicable.\n", "  The electronic structure of the zero-gap two-dimensional graphene has a\ncharge neutrality point exactly at the Fermi level that limits the practical\napplication of this material. There are several ways to modify the\nFermi-level-region of graphene, e.g. adsorption of graphene on different\nsubstrates or different molecules on its surface. In all cases the so-called\ndispersion or van der Waals interactions can play a crucial role in the\nmechanism, which describes the modification of electronic structure of\ngraphene. The adsorption of water on graphene is not very accurately reproduced\nin the standard density functional theory (DFT) calculations and\nhighly-accurate quantum-chemical treatments are required. A possibility to\napply wavefunction-based methods to extended systems is the use of local\ncorrelation schemes. The adsorption energies obtained in the present work by\nmeans of CCSD(T) are much higher in magnitude than the values calculated with\nstandard DFT functional although they agree that physisorption is observed. The\nobtained results are compared with the values available in literature for\nbinding of water on the graphene-like substrates.\n", "  A beam of polar molecules can be focused and transported through an ac\nelectric quadrupole guide. At a given ac frequency, the transmission of the\nguide depends on the mass-to-dipole-moment (m/\\textmu) ratio of the molecular\nquantum state. Here we present a detailed characterization of the m/\\textmu\nselector, using a pulsed beam of benzonitrile (C$_6$H$_5$CN) molecules in\ncombination with rotational quantum state resolved detection. The arrival time\ndistribution as well as the transverse velocity distribution of the molecules\nexiting the selector are measured as a function of ac frequency. The\n\\textmu/$\\Delta$\\textmu resolution of the selector can be controlled by the\napplied ac waveforms and a value of up to 20 can be obtained with the present\nsetup. This is sufficient to exclusively transmit molecules in the absolute\nground state of benzonitrile, or rather in quantum states that have the same\nm/\\textmu value as the ground state. The operation characteristics of the\nm/\\textmu selector are in quantitative agreement with the outcome of trajectory\nsimulations.\n", "  Interfacial electron transfer (IET) dynamics in 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3, 3, 3',\n3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD) dye molecules / indium tin oxide (ITO)\nfilm system have been probed at the ensemble and single-molecule level by\nrecording the change of fluorescence emission intensity. By comparing the\ndifference of the external electric current (EEC) dependence of lifetime and\nintensity for enambles and single molecules, it is shown that the\nsingle-molecule probe can effcienly demonstrate the IET dynamics. The backward\nelectron transfer and electron transfer of ground state induce the single\nmolecules fluorescence quenching when an EEC is applied to ITO film.\n", "  State-of-the-art {\\em ab initio} techniques have been applied to compute the\npotential energy curves for the SrYb molecule in the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation for the ground state and first fifteen excited singlet and\ntriplet states within the coupled-cluster framework. The leading long-range\ncoefficients describing the dispersion interactions at large interatomic\ndistances are also reported. The electric transition dipole moments have been\nobtained as the first residue of the polarization propagator computed with the\nlinear response coupled-cluster method restricted to single and double\nexcitations. Spin-orbit coupling matrix elements have been evaluated using the\nmultireference configuration interaction method restricted to single and double\nexcitations with a large active space. The electronic structure data was\nemployed to investigate the possibility of forming deeply bound ultracold SrYb\nmolecules in an optical lattice in a photoassociation experiment using\ncontinuous-wave lasers. Photoassociation near the intercombination line\ntransition of atomic strontium into the vibrational levels of the strongly\nspin-orbit mixed $b^3\\Sigma^+$, $a^3\\Pi$, $A^1\\Pi$, and $C^1\\Pi$ states with\nsubsequent efficient stabilization into the $v^{\\prime\\prime}=1$ vibrational\nlevel of the electronic ground state is proposed. Ground state SrYb molecules\ncan be accumulated by making use of collisional decay from $v^{\\prime\\prime}=1$\nto $v^{\\prime\\prime}=0$. Alternatively, photoassociation and stabilization to\n$v^{\\prime\\prime}=0$ can proceed via stimulated Raman adiabatic passage\nprovided that the trapping frequency of the optical lattice is large enough and\nphase coherence between the pulses can be maintained over at least tens of\nmicroseconds.\n", "  The formation of $^{40}$Ca$_2^+$ molecular ions is observed in a hybrid\n$^{40}$Ca magneto-optical and ion trap system. The molecular ion formation\nprocess is determined to be two-photon photo-associative ionization of\nultracold $^{40}$Ca atoms. A lower bound for the two-body, two-photon rate\nconstant is found to be $\\bar{\\beta} \\geq 2 \\pm 1 \\times 10^{-15}$ cm$^{3}$ Hz.\n$\\textit{Ab initio}$ molecular potential curves are calculated for the neutral\nCa$_2$ and ionic Ca$_2^+$ molecules and used in a model that identifies the\nphoto-associative ionization pathway. As this technique does not require a\nseparate photo-association laser, it could find use as a simple, robust method\nfor producing ultracold, state-selected molecular ions.\n", "  We consider the use of pulse-shaped broadband femtosecond lasers to optically\ncool rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of molecules. Since this\napproach relies on cooling rotational and vibrational quanta by exciting an\nelectronic transition, it is most easily applicable to molecules with similar\nground and excited potential energy surfaces, such that the vibrational state\nis usually unchanged during electronic relaxation. Compared with schemes that\ncool rotations by exciting vibrations, this approach achieves internal cooling\non the orders-of- magnitude faster electronic decay timescale and is\npotentially applicable to apolar molecules. For AlH+, a candidate species, a\nrate-equation simulation indicates that rovibrational equilibrium should be\nachievable in 8 \\mu s. In addition, we report laboratory demonstration of\noptical pulse shaping with sufficient resolution and power for rotational\ncooling of AlH+.\n", "  The bound states of the fermionic ^3He(2 ^3S_1)+ ^3He(2 ^3P_j)system, where\nj=0,1,2, are investigated using the recently available ab initio short-range\n${}^{1,3,5}\\Sigma^{+}_{g,u}$ and ${}^{1,3,5}\\Pi_{g,u}$ potentials computed by\nDeguilhem et al. (J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys., 2009, 42, 015102).\nSingle-channel and multichannel calculations have been undertaken in order to\ninvestigate the effects of Coriolis and non-adiabatic couplings. The possible\nexperimental observability of the theoretical levels is assessed using criteria\nbased upon the short-range character of each level and their coupling to\nmetastable ground states. Purely long-range levels have been identified and 30\nshort-range levels near five asymptotes are suggested for experimental\ninvestigation.\n", "  The applicability of the local hardness as defined by the derivative of the\nchemical potential with respect to the electron density is undermined by an\nessential ambiguity arising from this definition. Further, the local quantity\ndefined in this way does not integrate to the (global) hardness - in contrast\nwith the local softness, which integrates to the softness. It has also been\nshown recently that with the conventional formulae, the largest values of local\nhardness do not necessarily correspond to the hardest regions of a molecule.\nHere, in an attempt to fix these drawbacks, we propose a new approach to define\nand evaluate the local hardness. We define a local chemical potential,\nutilizing the fact that the chemical potential emerges as the additive constant\nterm in the number-conserving functional derivative of the energy density\nfunctional. Then, differentiation of this local chemical potential with respect\nto the number of electrons leads to a local hardness that integrates to the\nhardness, and possesses a favourable property; namely, within any given\nelectron system, it is in a local inverse relation with the Fukui function,\nwhich is known to be a proper indicator of local softness in the case of soft\nsystems. Numerical tests for a few selected molecules and a detailed analysis,\ncomparing the new definition of local hardness with the previous ones, show\npromising results.\n", "  Homo- and heteronuclear alkali quartet trimers of the type K_{3-n}Rb_{n}\n(n=0,1,2,3) formed on helium nanodroplets are probed by one-color femtosecond\nphotoionization spectroscopy. The obtained requencies are assigned to\nvibrations in different electronic states by comparison to high level ab initio\ncalculations of the involved potentials including pronounced Jahn-Teller and\nspin-orbit couplings. Despite the fact that the resulting complex vibronic\nstructure of the heavy alkali molecules complicates the comparison of\nexperiment and theory we find good agreement for many of the observed lines for\nall species.\n", "  Employing a two-stage cryogenic buffer gas cell, we produce a cold,\nhydrodynamically extracted beam of calcium monohydride molecules with a near\neffusive velocity distribution. Beam dynamics, thermalization and slowing are\nstudied using laser spectroscopy. The key to this hybrid, effusive-like beam\nsource is a \"slowing cell\" placed immediately after a hydrodynamic, cryogenic\nsource [Patterson et al., J. Chem. Phys., 2007, 126, 154307]. The resulting CaH\nbeams are created in two regimes. One modestly boosted beam has a forward\nvelocity of vf = 65 m/s, a narrow velocity spread, and a flux of 10^9 molecules\nper pulse. The other has the slowest forward velocity of vf = 40 m/s, a\nlongitudinal temperature of 3.6 K, and a flux of 5x10^8 molecules per pulse.\n", "  We report the Stark deceleration of CaF molecules in the strong-field seeking\nground state and in a weak-field seeking component of a rotationally-excited\nstate. We use two types of decelerator, a conventional Stark decelerator for\nthe weak-field seekers, and an alternating gradient decelerator for the\nstrong-field seekers, and we compare their relative merits. We also consider\nthe application of laser cooling to increase the phase-space density of\ndecelerated molecules.\n", "  We show that weakly bound He-containing van der Waals molecules can be\nproduced and magnetically trapped in buffer-gas cooling experiments, and\nprovide a general model for the formation and dynamics of these molecules. Our\nanalysis shows that, at typical experimental parameters, thermodynamics favors\nthe formation of van der Waals complexes composed of a helium atom bound to\nmost open-shell atoms and molecules, and that complex formation occurs quickly\nenough to ensure chemical equilibrium. For molecular pairs composed of a He\natom and an S-state atom, the molecular spin is stable during formation,\ndissociation, and collisions, and thus these molecules can be magnetically\ntrapped. Collisional spin relaxations are too slow to affect trap lifetimes.\nHowever, helium-3-containing complexes can change spin due to adiabatic\ncrossings between trapped and untrapped Zeeman states, mediated by the\nanisotropic hyperfine interaction, causing trap loss. We provide a detailed\nmodel for Ag3He molecules, using ab initio calculation of Ag-He interaction\npotentials and spin interactions, quantum scattering theory, and direct Monte\nCarlo simulations to describe formation and spin relaxation in this system. The\ncalculated rate of spin-change agrees quantitatively with experimental\nobservations, providing indirect evidence for molecular formation in\nbuffer-gas-cooled magnetic traps.\n", "  Based on density functional theory calculations and group theoretical\nanalysis, we have studied NaLaMnWO$_{6}$ compound which has been recently\nsynthesized [Phys. Rev. B 79, 224428 (2009)] and belongs to the $AA'BB'{\\rm\nO}_{6}$ family of double perovskites. At low temperature, the structure has\nmonoclinic $P2_{1}$ symmetry, with layered ordering of the Na and La ions and\nrocksalt ordering of Mn and W ions. The Mn atoms show an antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) collinear spin ordering, and the compound has been reported as a\npotential multiferroic. By comparing the low symmetry structure with a parent\nphase of $P4/nmm$ symmetry, two distortion modes are found dominant. They\ncorrespond to MnO$_{6}$ and WO$_{6}$ octahedron \\textit{tilt} modes, often\nfound in many simple perovskites. While in the latter these common tilting\ninstabilities yield non-polar phases, in NaLaMnWO$_{6}$ the additional presence\nof the $A$-$A^{'}$ cation ordering is sufficient to make these rigid unit modes\nas a source of the ferroelectricity. Through a trilinear coupling with the two\nunstable tilting modes, a significant polar distortion is induced, although the\nsystem has no intrinsic polar instability. The calculated electric polarization\nresulting from this polar distortion is as large as $\\sim$ 16 ${\\mu}{\\rm\nC/cm^{2}}$. Despite its secondary character, this polarization is coupled with\nthe dominant tilting modes and its switching is bound to produce the switching\nof one of two tilts, enhancing in this way a possible interaction with the\nmagnetic ordering. The transformation of common non-polar purely steric\ninstabilities into sources of ferroelectricity through a controlled\nmodification of the parent structure, as done here by the cation ordering, is a\nphenomenon to be further explored.\n", "  The nature of the interaction between ultracold atoms with a large orbital\nand spin angular momentum has attracted considerable attention. It was\nsuggested that such interactions can lead to the realization of exotic states\nof highly correlated matter. Here, we report on a theoretical study of the\ncompeting anisotropic dispersion, magnetic dipole-dipole, and electric\nquadrupole-quadrupole forces between two dysprosium atoms. Each dysprosium atom\nhas an orbital angular momentum L=6 and magnetic moment $\\mu=10\\mu_B$. We show\nthat the dispersion coefficients of the ground state adiabatic potentials lie\nbetween 1865 a.u. and 1890 a.u., creating a non-negligible anisotropy with a\nspread of 25 a.u. and that the electric quadrupole-quadrupole interaction is\nweak compared to the other interactions. We also find that for interatomic\nseparations $R< 50\\,a_0$ both the anisotropic dispersion and magnetic\ndipole-dipole potential are larger than the atomic Zeeman splittings for\nexternal magnetic fields of order 10 G to 100 G. At these separations spin\nexchange can occur. We finish by describing two scattering models for inelastic\nspin exchange. A universal scattering theory is used to model loss due to the\nanisotropy in the dispersion and a distorted-wave-Born theory is used to model\nlosses from the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction for the $^{164}$Dy isotope.\nThese models find loss rates that are the same order of magnitude as the\nexperimental value.\n", "  We explore the photodissociation of polar dimers in static electric fields in\nthe cold regime using the example of the LiCs molecule. A giant enhancement of\nthe differential cross section is found for laboratory electric field\nstrengths, and analyzed with varying rovibrational bound states, continuum\nenergies as well as field strengths.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of recent laser-alignment and\nmixed-field-orientation experiments of asymmetric top molecules. In these\nexperiments, pendular states were created using linearly polarized strong ac\nelectric fields from pulsed lasers in combination with weak electrostatic\nfields. We compare the outcome of our calculations with experimental results\nobtained for the prototypical large molecule benzonitrile (C$_7$H$_5$N) [J.L.\nHansen et al, Phys. Rev. A, 83, 023406 (2011)] and explore the directional\nproperties of the molecular ensemble for several field configurations, i.e.,\nfor various field strengths and angles between ac and dc fields. For\nperpendicular fields one obtains pure alignment, which is well reproduced by\nthe simulations. For tilted fields, we show that a fully adiabatic description\nof the process does not reproduce the experimentally observed orientation, and\nit is mandatory to use a diabatic model for population transfer between\nrotational states. We develop such a model and compare its outcome to the\nexperimental data confirming the importance of non-adiabatic processes in the\nfield-dressed molecular dynamics.\n", "  A new modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation accounting for the finite size of\nthe ions valid for realistic salt-free concentrated suspensions has been\nderived, extending the formalism developed for pure salt-free suspensions [Roa\net al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2011, 13, 3960-3968] to real experimental\nconditions. These realistic suspensions include water dissociation ions and\nthose generated by atmospheric carbon dioxide contamination, in addition to the\nadded counterions released by the particles to the solution. The electric\npotential at the particle surface will be calculated for different ion sizes\nand compared with classical Poisson-Boltzmann predictions for point-like ions,\nas a function of particle charge and volume fraction. The realistic predictions\nturn out to be essential to achieve a closer picture of real salt-free\nsuspensions, and even more important when ionic size effects are incorporated\nto the electric double layer description. We think that both corrections have\nto be taken into account when developing new realistic electrokinetic models,\nand surely will help in the comparison with experiments for low-salt or\nrealistic salt-free systems.\n", "  19F isotropic chemical shifts for alkali, alkaline earth and rare earth of\ncolumn 3 basic fluorides are measured and the corresponding isotropic chemical\nshieldings are calculated using the GIPAW method. When using PBE exchange\ncorrelation functional for the treatment of the cationic localized empty\norbitals of Ca2+, Sc3+ (3d) and La3+ (4f), a correction is needed to accurately\ncalculate 19F chemical shieldings. We show that the correlation between\nexperimental isotropic chemical shifts and calculated isotropic chemical\nshieldings established for the studied compounds allows to predict 19F NMR\nspectra of crystalline compounds with a relatively good accuracy. In addition,\nwe experimentally determine the quadrupolar parameters of 25Mg in MgF2 and\ncalculate the electric field gradient of 25Mg in MgF2 and 139La in LaF3 using\nboth PAW and LAPW methods. The orientation of the EFG components in the\ncrystallographic frame, provided by DFT calculations, is analysed in term of\nelectron densities. It is shown that consideration of the quadrupolar charge\ndeformation is essential for the analysis of slightly distorted environments or\nhighly irregular polyhedra.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze electric deflection fields for polar molecules in\nterms of a multipole expansion and derive a simple but rather insightful\nexpression for the force on the molecules. Ideally, a deflection field exerts a\nstrong, constant force in one direction, while the force in the other\ndirections is zero. We show how, by a proper choice of the expansion\ncoefficients, this ideal can be best approximated. We present a design for a\npractical electrode geometry based on this analysis. By bending such a\ndeflection field into a circle, a simple storage ring can be created; the\ndirect analog of a weak-focusing cyclotron for charged particles. We show that\nfor realistic parameters a weak-focusing ring is only stable for molecules with\na very low velocity. A strong-focusing (alternating-gradient) storage ring can\nbe created by arranging many straight deflection fields in a circle and by\nalternating the sign of the hexapole term between adjacent deflection fields.\nThe acceptance of this ring is numerically calculated for realistic parameters.\nSuch a storage might prove useful in experiments looking for an EDM of\nelementary particles.\n", "  We study the possibility to use interaction between a polar molecule in the\nground electronic and vibrational state and a Rydberg atom to construct\ntwo-qubit gates between molecular qubits and to coherently control molecular\nstates. A polar molecule within the electron orbit in a Rydberg atom can either\nshift the Rydberg state, or form Rydberg molecule. Both the atomic shift and\nthe Rydberg molecule states depend on the initial internal state of the polar\nmolecule, resulting in molecular state dependent van der Waals or dipole-dipole\ninteraction between Rydberg atoms. Rydberg atoms mediated interaction between\npolar molecules can be enhanced up to $10^{3}$ times. We describe how the\ncoupling between a polar molecule and a Rydberg atom can be applied to coherent\ncontrol of molecular states, specifically, to individual addressing of\nmolecules in an optical lattice and non-destructive readout of molecular\nqubits.\n", "  We make use of an inhomogeneous electrostatic dipole field to impart a\nquantum-state-dependent deflection to a pulsed beam of OCS molecules, and show\nthat those molecules residing in the absolute ground state, $X ^1\\Sigma^+$,\n$\\ket{00^00}$, J=0, can be separated out by selecting the most deflected part\nof the molecular beam. Past the deflector, we irradiate the molecular beam by a\nlinearly polarized pulsed nonresonant laser beam that impulsively aligns the\nOCS molecules. Their alignment, monitored via velocity-map imaging, is measured\nas a function of time, and the time dependence of the alignment is used to\ndetermine the quantum state composition of the beam. We find significant\nenhancements of the alignment (\\costhetasqtd $= 0.84$) and of state purity ($>\n92$%) for a state-selected, deflected beam compared with an undeflected beam.\n", "  We perform one- and two-photon high resolution spectroscopy on ultracold\nsamples of RbCs Feshbach molecules with the aim to identify a suitable route\nfor efficient ground-state transfer in the quantum-gas regime to produce\nquantum gases of dipolar RbCs ground-state molecules. One-photon loss\nspectroscopy allows us to probe deeply bound rovibrational levels of the mixed\nexcited (A1{\\Sigma}+ - b3{\\Pi}0) 0+ molecular states. Two-photon dark state\nspectroscopy connects the initial Feshbach state to the rovibronic ground\nstate. We determine the binding energy of the lowest rovibrational level\n|v\"=0,J\"=0> of the X1{\\Sigma}+ ground state to be DX 0 = 3811.5755(16) 1/cm, a\n300-fold improvement in accuracy with respect to previous data. We are now in\nthe position to perform stimulated two-photon Raman transfer to the rovibronic\nground state.\n", "  We show that individual vibrational modes in single-molecule junctions with\nasymmetric molecule-lead coupling can be selectively excited by applying an\nexternal bias voltage. Thereby, a non-statistical distribution of vibrational\nenergy can be generated, that is, a mode with a high frequency can be stronger\nexcited than a mode with a lower frequency. This is of particular interest in\nthe context of mode-selective chemistry, where one aims to break specific (not\nnecessarily the weakest) chemical bond in a molecule. Such mode-selective\nvibrational excitation is demonstrated for two generic model systems\nrepresenting asymmetric molecular junctions and/or scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy experiments. To this end, we employ two complementary theoretical\napproaches, a nonequilibrium Green's function approach and a master equation\napproach. The comparison of both methods reveals good agreement in describing\nresonant electron transport through a single-molecule contact, but also\nhighlights the role of non-resonant transport processes, in particular\nco-tunneling and off-resonant electron-hole pair creation processes.\n", "  Universal collision rate constants are calculated for ultracold collisions of\ntwo like bosonic or fermionic heteronuclear alkali-metal dimers involving the\nspecies Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs. Universal collisions are those for which the\nshort range probability of a reactive or quenching collision is unity such that\na collision removes a pair of molecules from the sample. In this case, the\ncollision rates are determined by universal quantum dynamics at very long range\ncompared to the chemical bond length. We calculate the universal rate constants\nfor reaction of the reactive dimers in their ground vibrational state $v=0$ and\nfor vibrational quenching of non-reactive dimers with $v \\ge 1$. Using the\nknown dipole moments and estimated van der Waals coefficients of each species,\nwe calculate electric field dependent loss rate constants for collisions of\nmolecules tightly confined to quasi-two-dimensional geometry by a\none-dimensional optical lattice. A simple scaling relation of the\nquasi-two-dimensional loss rate constants with dipole strength, trap frequency\nand collision energy is given for like bosons or like fermions. It should be\npossible to stabilize ultracold dimers of any of these species against\ndestructive collisions by confining them in a lattice and orienting them with\nelectric field of less than 20 kV/cm.\n", "  A calculation of dynamic polarizabilities of rovibrational states with\nvibrational quantum number $v=0-7$ and rotational quantum number $J=0,1$ in the\n1s$\\sigma_g$ ground-state potential of HD$^+$ is presented. Polarizability\ncontributions by transitions involving other 1s$\\sigma_g$ rovibrational states\nare explicitly calculated, whereas contributions by electronic transitions are\ntreated quasi-statically and partially derived from existing data [R.E. Moss\nand L. Valenzano, \\textit{Molec. Phys.}, 2002, \\textbf{100}, 1527]. Our model\nis valid for wavelengths $>4~\\mu$m and is used to to assess level shifts due to\nthe blackbody radiation (BBR) electric field encountered in experimental\nhigh-resolution laser spectroscopy of trapped HD$^+$ ions. Polarizabilities of\n1s$\\sigma_g$ rovibrational states obtained here agree with available existing\naccurate \\textit{ab initio} results. It is shown that the Stark effect due to\nBBR is dynamic and cannot be treated quasi-statically, as is often done in the\ncase of atomic ions. Furthermore it is pointed out that the dynamic Stark\nshifts have tensorial character and depend strongly on the polarization state\nof the electric field. Numerical results of BBR-induced Stark shifts are\npresented, showing that Lamb-Dicke spectroscopy of narrow vibrational optical\nlines ($\\sim 10$ Hz natural linewidth) in HD$^+$ will become affected by BBR\nshifts only at the $10^{-16}$ level.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the long-range electrostatic interactions\nbetween a ground-state homonuclear alkali-metal dimer and an excited\nalkali-metal atom taking into account its fine-structure. The interaction\ninvolves the combination of first-order quadrupole-quadrupole and second-order\ndipole-dipole effects. Depending on the considered species, the atomic\nspin-orbit may be comparable to the atom-molecule electrostatic energy and to\nthe dimer rotational structure. Here we extend our general description in the\nframework of the second-order degenerate perturbation theory [M. Lepers and O.\nDulieu, Eur. Phys. J. D, 2011] to various regimes induced by the magnitude of\nthe atomic spin-orbit. A complex dynamics of the atom-molecule may take place\nat large distances, which may have consequences for the search for an universal\nmodel of ultracold inelastic collisions as proposed for instance in [Z.\nIdziaszek and P. S. Julienne, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{104}, 113202 (2010)].\n", "  We present results from a comprehensive numerical study of {\\it morphological\nphase separation} (MPS) in unstable thin liquid films on a 2-dimensional\nsubstrate. We study the quantitative properties of the evolution morphology via\nseveral experimentally relevant markers, e.g., correlation function, structure\nfactor, domain-size and defect-size probability distributions, and growth laws.\nOur results suggest that the late-stage morphologies exhibit dynamical scaling,\nand their evolution is self-similar in time. We emphasize the analogies and\ndifferences between MPS in films and segregation kinetics in unstable binary\nmixtures.\n", "  Quantum interference (QI) in molecular transport junctions can lead to\ndramatic reductions of the electron transmission at certain energies. In a\nrecent work [Markussen et al., Nano Lett. 2010, 10, 4260] we showed how the\npresence of such transmission nodes near the Fermi energy can be predicted\nsolely from the structure of a conjugated molecule when the energies of the\natomic p_z orbitals do not vary too much. Here we relax the assumption of equal\non-site energies and generalize the graphical scheme to molecules containing\ndifferent atomic species. We use this diagrammatic scheme together with\ntight-binding and density functional theory calculations to investigate QI in\nlinear molecular chains and aromatic molecules with different side groups. For\nthe molecular chains we find a linear relation between the position of the\ntransmission nodes and the side group pi orbital energy. In contrast, the\ntransmission functions of functionalized aromatic molecules generally display a\nrather complex nodal structure due to the interplay between molecular topology\nand the energy of the side group orbital.\n", "  We clarify an important aspect of density functional theories, the broadening\nof the derivative discontinuity (DD) in a quantum system, with fluctuating\nparticle number. Our focus is on a correlated model system, the single level\nquantum dot in the regime of the Coulomb blockade. We find that the\nDD-broadening is controlled by the small parameter $\\Gamma/U$, where $\\Gamma$\nis the level broadening due to contacting and $U$ is a measure of the charging\nenergy. Our analysis suggests, that Kondoesque fluctuations have a tendency to\nincrease the DD-broadening, in our model by a factor of two.\n", "  The UA9 experimental equipment was installed in the CERN-SPS in March '09\nwith the aim of investigating crystal assisted collimation in coasting mode.\n  Its basic layout comprises silicon bent crystals acting as primary\ncollimators mounted inside two vacuum vessels. A movable 60 cm long block of\ntungsten located downstream at about 90 degrees phase advance intercepts the\ndeflected beam.\n  Scintillators, Gas Electron Multiplier chambers and other beam loss monitors\nmeasure nuclear loss rates induced by the interaction of the beam halo in the\ncrystal. Roman pots are installed in the path of the deflected particles and\nare equipped with a Medipix detector to reconstruct the transverse distribution\nof the impinging beam. Finally UA9 takes advantage of an LHC-collimator\nprototype installed close to the Roman pot to help in setting the beam\nconditions and to analyze the efficiency to deflect the beam. This paper\ndescribes in details the hardware installed to study the crystal collimation\nduring 2010.\n", "  Ultracold metastable RbCs molecules are observed in a double species MOT\nthrough photoassociation near the Rb(5S$_{1/2}$)+Cs(6P$_{3/2}$) dissociation\nlimit followed by radiative stabilization. The molecules are formed in their\nlowest triplet electronic state and are detected by resonant enhanced\ntwo-photon ionization through the previously unobserved $(3)^{3}\\Pi \\leftarrow\na^{3}\\Sigma^{+}$ band. The large rotational structure of the observed\nphotoassociation lines is assigned to the lowest vibrational levels of the\n$0^+,0^-$ excited states correlated to the Rb(5P$_{1/2}$)+Cs(6S$_{1/2}$)\ndissociation limit. This demonstrates the possibility to induce direct\nphotoassociation in heteronuclear alkali-metal molecules at short internuclear\ndistance, as pointed out in [J. Deiglmayr \\textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{101}, 13304 (2008)].\n", "  We present quantum-theoretical studies of collisions between an open-shell\nS-state atom and a ^2Pi-state molecule in the presence of a magnetic field. We\nanalyze the collisional Hamiltonian and discuss possible mechanisms for\ninelastic collisions in such systems. The theory is applied to the collisions\nof the nitrogen atom (^4S) with the OH molecule, with both collision partners\ninitially in fully spin-stretched (magnetically trappable) states, assuming\nthat the interaction takes place exclusively on the two high-spin (quintet)\npotential energy surfaces. The surfaces for the quintet states are obtained\nfrom spin-unrestricted coupled-cluster calculations with single, double, and\nnoniterative triple excitations. We find substantial inelasticity, arising from\nstrong couplings due to the anisotropy of the interaction potential and the\nanisotropic spin-spin dipolar interaction. The mechanism involving the dipolar\ninteraction dominates for small magnetic field strengths and ultralow collision\nenergies, while the mechanism involving the potential anisotropy prevails when\nthe field strength is larger (above 100 G) or the collision energy is higher\n(above 1 mK). The numerical results suggest that sympathetic cooling of\nmagnetically trapped OH by collisions with ultracold N atoms will not be\nsuccessful at higher temperatures.\n", "  We have developed x-ray diffraction measurements with high energy-resolution\nand accuracy to study water structure at three different temperatures (7, 25\nand 66 C) under normal pressure. Using a spherically curved Ge crystal an\nenergy resolution better than 15 eV has been achieved which eliminates\ninfluence from Compton scattering. The high quality of the data allows a\nprecise oxygen-oxygen pair correlation function (PCF) to be directly derived\nfrom the Fourier transform of the experimental data resolving shell structure\nout to ~12 {\\AA}, i.e. 5 hydration shells. Large-scale molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations using the TIP4P/2005 force-field reproduce excellently the\nexperimental shell-structure in the range 4-12 {\\AA} although less agreement is\nseen for the first peak in the PCF. The Local Structure Index [J. Chem. Phys.\n104, 7671 (1996)] identifies a tetrahedral minority giving the\nintermediate-range oscillations in the PCF and a disordered majority providing\na more featureless background in this range. The current study supports the\nproposal that the structure of liquid water, even at high temperatures, can be\ndescribed in terms of a two-state fluctuation model involving local structures\nrelated to the high-density and low-density forms of liquid water postulated in\nthe liquid-liquid phase transition hypothesis.\n", "  Based on classical molecular dynamics simulations, we discuss the impact of\nCoulombic interactions on a comprehensive set of properties of room temperature\nionic liquids (RTILs) containing 1,3 dimethylimidazolium (MMIM+), N\nbutylpyridinium (BPY+), and bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (TFSI-) ions.\nIonic transport is found to be noticeably hindered by the excessive Coulombic\nenergy, originating from the neglect of electronic polarization in the\ncondensed phase of these RTILs. Starting from the models, recently suggested by\nLopes and Padua, we show that realistic ionic dynamics can be achieved by the\nuniform scaling of electrostatic charges on all interaction sites. The original\nmodel systematically overestimates density and heat of vaporization of RTILs.\nSince density linearly depends on charge scaling, it is possible to use it as a\nconvenient beacon to promptly derive a correct scaling factor. Based on the\nsimulations of [BPY][TFSI] and [MMIM][TFSI] over a wide temperature range, we\nconclude that suggested technique is feasible to greatly improve quality of the\nalready existing non-polarizable FFs for RTILs.\n", "  We introduce and numerically solve a mathematical model of the experimentally\nestablished mechanisms responsible for the symmetry breaking transition\nobserved in the chiral crystallization experiments reported by I. Weissbuch, L.\nAddadi, L. Leiserowitz and M. Lahav, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 (1988), 561-567. The\nmathematical model is based on five basic processes: (1) The formation of\nachiral glycine clusters in solution, (2) The nucleation of oriented glycine\ncrystals at the air/water interface in the presence of hydrophobic amino acids,\n(3) A kinetic orienting effect which inhibits crystal growth, (4) The\nenantioselective occlusion of the amino acids from solution, and (5) The growth\nof oriented host glycine crystals at the interface. We translate these\nprocesses into differential rate equations. We first study the model with the\norienting process (2) without (3) and then combine both allowing us to make\ndetailed comparisons of both orienting effects which actually act in unison in\nthe experiment. Numerical results indicate that the model can yield a high\npercentage orientation of the mixed crystals at the interface and the\nconsequent resolution of the initially racemic mixture of amino acids in\nsolution. The model thus leads to separation of enantiomeric territories, the\ngeneration and amplification of optical activity by enantioselective occlusion\nof chiral additives through chiral surfaces of glycine crystals.\n", "  The fluorescence spectrum resulting from laser excitation of the\nA^{2}\\Pi_{1/2} - X^{2}\\Sigma^{+} (0,0) band of ytterbium monofluoride, YbF, has\nbeen recorded and analyzed to determine the Franck-Condon factors. The measured\nvalues are compared with those predicted from Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR)\npotential energy curves. From the fluorescence decay curve the radiative\nlifetime of the A^{2}\\Pi_{1/2} state is measured to be 28\\pm2 ns, and the\ncorresponding transition dipole moment is 4.39\\pm0.16 D. The implications for\nlaser cooling YbF are discussed.\n", "  From a fundamental and application point of view it is of importance to\nunderstand how charge carrier generation and transport in a conjugated polymer\n(CP):fullerene blend are affected by the blend morphology. In this work\nlight-induced electron spin resonance (LESR) spectra and transient ESR response\nsignals are recorded on non-annealed and annealed blend layers consisting of\nalkyl substituted thieno[3,2-b]thiophene copolymers (pATBT) and the soluble\nfullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) at\ntemperatures ranging from 10 to 180 K. Annealing of the blend sample leads to a\nreduction of the steady state concentration of light-induced PCBM anions within\nthe blend at low temperatures (T = 10 K) and continuous illumination. This is\nexplained on the basis of the reducing interfacial area of the blend composite\non annealing, and the high activation energy for electron diffusion in PCBM\nblends leading to trapped electrons near the interface with the CP. As a\nconsequence, these trapped electrons block consecutive electron transfer from\nan exciton on a CP to the PCBM domain, resulting in a relatively low\nconcentration charge carriers in the annealed blend. Analysis of the transient\nESR data allows us to conclude that in annealed samples diamagnetic\nbi-polaronic states on the CPs are generated at low temperature. The formation\nof these states is related to the generation and interaction of multiple\npositive polarons in the large crystalline polymer domains present in the\nannealed sample.\n", "  In this work we demonstrate vibrational spectroscopy of polyatomic ions that\nare trapped and sympathetically cooled by laser-cooled atomic ions. We use the\nprotonated dipeptide tryptophane-alanine (HTyrAla+) as a model system, cooled\nby Barium ions to less than 800mK secular temperature. The spectroscopy is\nperformed on the fundamental vibrational transition of a local vibrational mode\nat 2.74 {\\mu}m using a continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator (OPO).\nResonant multi-photon IR dissociation spectroscopy (without the use of a UV\nlaser) generates charged molecular fragments, which are sympathetically cooled\nand trapped, and subsequently released from the trap and counted. We measured\nthe cross section for R-IRMPD under conditions of low intensity, and found it\nto be approximately two orders smaller than the vibrational excitation cross\nsection. The observed rotational bandwidth of the vibrational transition is\nlarger than the one expected from the combined effects of 300 K black-body\ntemperature, conformer-dependent line shifts, and intermolecular vibrational\nrelaxation broadening (J. Stearns et al., J. Chem. Phys., 127, 154322-7\n(2007)). This indicates that as the internal energy of the molecule grows, an\nincrease of the rotational temperature of the molecular ions well above room\ntemperature (up to on the order of 1000K), and/or an appreciable shift of the\nvibrational transition frequency (approx. 6-8 cm$^{-1}$) occurs.\n", "  We study the electrophoretic mobility of spherical particles and the\nelectrical conductivity in salt-free concentrated suspensions including finite\nion size effects. An ideal salt-free suspension is composed of just charged\ncolloidal particles and the added counterions that counterbalance their surface\ncharge. In a very recent paper [Roa et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2011, 13,\n3960- 3968] we presented a model for the equilibrium electric double layer for\nthis kind of suspensions considering the size of the counterions, and now we\nextend this work to analyze the response of the suspension under a static\nexternal electric field. The numerical results show the high importance of such\ncorrections for moderate to high particle charges, especially when a region of\nclosest approach of the counterions to the particle surface is considered. The\npresent work sets the basis for further theoretical models with finite ion size\ncorrections, concerning particularly the ac electrokinetics and rheology of\nsuch systems.\n", "  A structural study is presented of ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations\nof Ge-As-Se calcogenide glasses performed at the same mean coordination number\nbut differing stoichiometry ranging between Se rich and Se poor glasses.\nStarting configurations are generated via Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations\nof Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) measurements of\nexperimental samples. Structural analysis is presented illustrating the bonding\ntrends found with changing stoichiometry.\n", "  We employ the density matrix renormalization group to construct the exact\ntime-dependent exchange correlation potential for an impurity model with an\napplied transport voltage. Even for short-ranged interaction we find an\ninfinitely long-ranged exchange correlation potential which is built up\n{instantly} after switching on the voltage. Our result demonstrates the\nfundamental difficulties of transport calculations based on time-dependent\ndensity functional theory. While formally the approach works, important\ninformation can be missing in the ground-state functionals and may be hidden in\nthe usually unknown non-equilibrium functionals.\n", "  Nanopores attracted a great deal of scientific interest as templates for\nbiological sensors as well as model systems to understand transport phenomena\nat the nanoscale. The experimental and theoretical analysis of nanopores has\nbeen so far focused on understanding the effect of the pore opening diameter on\nionic transport. In this article we present systematic studies on the\ndependence of ion transport properties on the pore length. Particular attention\nwas given to the effect of ion current rectification exhibited for conically\nshaped nanopores with homogeneous surface charges. We found that reducing the\nlength of conically shaped nanopores significantly lowered their ability to\nrectify ion current. However, rectification properties of short pores can be\nenhanced by tailoring the surface charge and the shape of the narrow opening.\nFurthermore we analyze the relationship of the rectification behavior and ion\nselectivity for different pore lengths. All simulations were performed using\nMsSimPore, a software package for solving the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP)\nequations. It is based on a novel finite element solver and allows for\nsimulations up to surface charge densities of -2 e/nm^2. MsSimPore is based on\n1D reduction of the PNP model, but allows for a direct treatment of the pore\nwith bulk electrolyte reservoirs, a feature which was previously used in higher\ndimensional models only. MsSimPore includes these reservoirs in the\ncalculations; a property especially important for short pores, where the ionic\nconcentrations and the electric potential vary strongly inside the pore as well\nas in the regions next to pore entrance.\n", "  We study the effects of covalent functionalization of single wall carbon\nnanotubes (CNT) on their elastic properties. We consider simple organic\nmolecules -NH, -NH2, -CH2, -CH3, -OH attached to CNTs' surface at various\ndensities. The studies are based on the first principles calculations in the\nframework of density functional theory. We have determined the changes in the\ngeometry and the elastic moduli of the functionalized CNTs as a function of the\ndensity of adsorbed molecules. It turns out that elastic moduli diminish with\nincreasing concentration of adsorbands, however, the functionalized CNTs remain\nstrong enough to be suitable for reinforcement of composites. The strongest\neffect is observed for CNTs functionalized with -CH2 radical, where the Young's\nmodulus of the functionalized system is by 30% smaller than in the pristine\nCNTs.\n", "  By means of the first-principles calculations combined with the tight-binding\napproximation, the strain-induced semiconductor-semimetal transition in\ngraphdiyne is discovered. It is shown that the band gap of graphdiyne increases\nfrom 0.47 eV to 1.39 eV with increasing the biaxial tensile strain, while the\nband gap decreases from 0.47 eV to nearly zero with increasing the uniaxial\ntensile strain, and Dirac cone-like electronic structures are observed. The\nuniaxial strain-induced changes of the electronic structures of graphdiyne come\nfrom the breaking of geometrical symmetry that lifts the degeneracy of energy\nbands. The properties of graphdiyne under strains are disclosed different\nremarkably from that of graphene.\n", "  Long-range corrected (LC) hybrid functionals and asymptotically corrected\n(AC) model potentials are two distinct density functional methods with correct\nasymptotic behavior. They are known to be accurate for properties that are\nsensitive to the asymptote of the exchange-correlation potential, such as the\nhighest occupied molecular orbital energies and Rydberg excitation energies of\nmolecules. To provide a comprehensive comparison, we investigate the\nperformance of the two schemes and others on a very wide range of applications,\nincluding the asymptote problems, self-interaction-error problems, energy-gap\nproblems, charge-transfer problems, and many others. The LC hybrid scheme is\nshown to consistently outperform the AC model potential scheme. In addition, to\nbe consistent with the molecules collected in the IP131 database [Y.-S. Lin,\nC.-W. Tsai, G.-D. Li, and J.-D. Chai, J. Chem. Phys., 2012, 136, 154109], we\nexpand the EA115 and FG115 databases to include, respectively, the vertical\nelectron affinities and fundamental gaps of the additional 16 molecules, and\ndevelop a new database AE113 (113 atomization energies), consisting of accurate\nreference values for the atomization energies of the 113 molecules in IP131.\nThese databases will be useful for assessing the accuracy of density functional\nmethods.\n", "  Applying to graphene oxides, molecular theory of graphene is based on the\noxide molecular origin when it is considered as a final product in the\nsuccession of a graphene molecule polyderivatives related to a particular\noxidation reaction. The graphene oxide structure is created in due course of\ncalculations following the algorithms that take into account the graphene\nmolecules natural radicalization, correlation of odd electrons, an extremely\nstrong influence of structure on properties, a sharp response of the molecule\nbehavior on small action of external factors. Taking together, the theory\nfacilities has allowed for getting a clear, transparent and understandable\nexplanation of hot points of the graphene oxide chemistry and suggesting\nreliable models of both chemically produced and chemically reduced graphene\noxides.\n", "  We have explored the manifold physical scenario emerging from a model of\nDynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) via thermal mixing under the hypothesis of\nhighly effective electron-electron interaction. When the electron and nuclear\nreservoirs are also assumed to be in strong thermal contact and the microwave\nirradiation saturates the target electron transition, the enhancement of the\nnuclear polarization is expected to be considerably high even if the\nirradiation frequency is set far away from the centre of the ESR line (as\nalready observed by Borghini) and the typical polarization time is reduced on\nmoving towards the boundaries of said line. More reasonable behaviours are\nobtained by reducing the level of microwave saturation or the contact between\nelectrons and nuclei in presence of nuclear leakage. In both cases the function\ndescribing the dependency of the steady state nuclear polarization on the\nfrequency of irradiation becomes sharper at the edges and the build up rate\ndecreases on moving off-resonance. If qualitatively similar in terms of the\neffects produced on nuclear polarization, the degree of microwave saturation\nand of electron-nucleus contact has a totally different impact on electron\npolarization, which is of course strongly correlated to the effectiveness of\nsaturation and almost insensitive, at the steady state, to the magnitude of the\ninteractions between the two spin reservoirs. The likelihood of the different\nscenario is discussed in the light of the experimental data currently available\nin literature, to point out which aspects are suitably accounted and which are\nnot by the declinations of thermal mixing DNP considered here.\n", "  Heat transfer can differ distinctly at the nanoscale from that at the\nmacroscale. Recent advancement in computational and experimental techniques has\nenabled a large number of interesting observations and understanding of heat\ntransfer processes at the nanoscale. In this review, we will first discuss\nrecent advances in computational and experimental methods used in nanoscale\nthermal transport studies, followed by reviews of novel thermal transport\nphenomena at the nanoscale observed in both computational and experimental\nstudies, and discussion on current understanding of these novel phenomena. Our\nperspectives on challenges and opportunities on computational and experimental\nmethods are also presented.\n", "  We investigate the stability of boron fullerene sets B76, B78 and B82. We\nevaluate the ground state energies, nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS),\nthe binding energies per atom and the band gap values by means of\nfirst-principles methods. We construct our fullerene design by capping of\npentagons and hexagons of B60 cage in such a way that the total number of atoms\nis preserved. In doing so, a new hole density definition is proposed such that\neach member of a fullerene group has a different hole density which depends on\nthe capping process. Our analysis reveal that each boron fullerene set has its\nlowest-energy configuration around the same normalized hole density and the\nmost stable cages are found in the fullerene groups which have relatively large\ndifference between the maximum and the minimum hole densities. The result is a\nnew stability measure relating the cage geometry characterized by the hole\ndensity to the relative energy.\n", "  {\\it Ab initio} potential energy and dipole moment surfaces are computed for\nsulfur trioxide (SO$_3$) at the CCSD(T)-F12b level of theory and appropriate\ntriple-zeta basis sets. These surfaces are fitted and used, with a slight\ncorrection for the equilibrium S--O distance, to compute pure rotational and\nrotation-vibraton spectra of \\sothree\\ using the variational nuclear motion\nprogram TROVE. The calculations considered transitions in the region 0--4000\n\\cm\\ with rotational states up to J=85. The resulting line list of 349~348~513\ntransitions is appropriate for modelling room temperature SO3 spectra. Good\nagreement is found with the observed infrared absorption spectra and the\ncalculations are used to place the measured relative intensities on an absolute\nscale. A list of 10~878 experimental transitions is provided in a form suitable\nfor inclusion in standard atmospheric and planetary spectroscopic databases.\n", "  We compare the conductance of an interacting ring of six lattice sites\nthreaded by flux $\\pi$ in a two terminal setup with the conductance of the\ncorresponding Kohn-Sham particles. Based on symmetry considerations we can show\nthat even within (lattice) Density Functional Theory employing the exact\nFunctional the conductance of the Kohn-Sham particles is exactly zero, while\nthe conductance of the physical system is close to the unitary limit. We show\nthat this fundamental problem might be solved by extending the standard DFT\nscheme.\n", "  The \\emph{semiclassical Wigner treatment} of Brown and Heller [J. Chem. Phys.\n75, 186 (1981)] is applied to triatomic direct photodissociations with the aim\nof accurately predicting final state distributions at relatively low\ncomputational cost, and having available a powerful interpretative tool. For\nthe first time, the treatment is full-dimensional. The proposed formulation\nclosely parallels the quantum description as far as possible. An approximate\nversion is proposed, which is still accurate while numerically much more\nefficient. In addition to be weighted by usual vibrational Wigner\ndistributions, final phase space states appear to be weighted by new\n\\emph{rotational Wigner distributions}. These densities have remarkable\nstructures clearly showing that classical trajectories most contributing to\nrotational state $j$ are those reaching the products with a rotational angular\nmomentum close to $[j(j+1)]^{1/2}$ (in $\\hbar$ unit). The previous methods\ninvolve running trajectories from the reagent molecule onto the products. The\nalternative \\emph{backward approach} [L. Bonnet, J. Chem. Phys. 133, 174108\n(2010)], in which trajectories are run in the reverse direction, is shown to\nstrongly improve the numerical efficiency of the most rigorous method in\naddition to be \\emph{state-selective}, and thus, ideally suited to the\ndescription of state-correlated distributions measured in velocity imaging\nexperiments. The results obtained by means of the previous methods are compared\nwith rigorous quantum results in the case of Guo's triatomic-like model of\nmethyl iodide photodissociation [J. Chem. Phys. 96, 6629 (1992)] and an\nastonishing agreement is found. In comparison, the standard method of Goursaud\n\\emph{et al.} [J. Chem. Phys. 65, 5453 (1976)] is only semi-quantitative.\n", "  We present a new theoretical method to treat the atom diatom radiative\nassociation within a time independent approach. This method is an adaptation of\nthe driven equations method developed for photodissociation. The bound states\nenergies and wave functions of the molecule are calculated exactly and used to\npropagate the overlap with the initial scattering wave function. In the second\npart of this paper, this approach is applied to the radiative association of\nthe N2H- anion. The main features of the radiative association cross sections\nare analysed and the magnitude of the calculated rate coefficient at 10 Kelvin\nis used to discuss the existence of the N2H- in the interstellar medium which\ncould be used as a tracer of both N2 and H-.\n", "  In this work the influence of many-electron effects on the shape of\ncharacteristic X-ray emission bands of the simple metals Mg and Al are examined\nby means of ab initio calculations and semi-empirical models. These approaches\nare also used for the analysis of C K-emission and absorption spectra of\ngraphene. Both, the dynamical screening of the core vacancy and the\nAuger-effect in the valence band (VB) have been taken into account. Dynamical\nscreening of the core vacancy by valence electrons (the so-called MND effect)\nis considered ab initio in the framework of density functional theory. The\nAuger effect in VB was taken into account within a semi-empirical method,\napproximating the quadratic dependence of the VB hole level width on the\ndifference between the level energy and the Fermi energy. All theoretical\nspectra are in very good agreement with available experimental data.\n", "  Spin-polarized first-principles calculations have been performed to tune the\nelectronic and optical properties of graphene (G) and boron-nitride (BN)\nquantum dots (QDs) through molecular charge-transfer using\nTetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) as dopants. From\nour calculations, we find that the nature of interaction between the dopants\nand QDs is similar to the interaction between the dopants and their\ntwo-dimensional counter parts of the QDs, namely, graphene and hexagonal\nboron-nitride sheets. Based on the values of formation energy and distance\nbetween QDs and dopants, we find that both the dopants are physisorbed on the\nQDs. Also, we find that GQDs interact strongly with the dopants compared to the\nBNQDS. Interestingly, though the dopants are physisorbed on QDs, their\ninteraction lead to a decrement in the HOMO-LUMO gap of QDs by more than half\nof their original value. We have also observed a spin-polarized HOMO-LUMO gap\nin certain QD-dopant complexes. Mulliken population analysis, Density of states\n(DOS), projected DOS (pDOS) plots and optical conductivity calculations have\nbeen performed to support and understand the reasons behind the above mentioned\nfindings.\n", "  Ionic liquids, salts in the liquid state under ambient conditions, are of\ngreat interest as precision lubricants. Ionic liquids form layered structures\nat surfaces, yet it is not clear how this nano-structure relates to their\nlubrication properties. We measured the friction force between atomically\nsmooth solid surfaces across ionic liquid films of controlled thickness in\nterms of the number of ion layers. Multiple friction-load regimes emerge, each\ncorresponding to a different number of ion layers in the film. In contrast to\nmolecular liquids, the friction coefficients differ for each layer due to their\nvarying composition.\n", "  In this work, we developed an interatomic potential for saturated\nhydrocarbons using the modified embedded-atom method (MEAM), a reactive\nsemi-empirical many-body potential based on density functional theory and pair\npotentials. We parameterized the potential by fitting to a large experimental\nand first-principles (FP) database consisting of 1) bond distances, bond\nangles, and atomization energies at 0 K of a homologous series of alkanes and\ntheir select isomers from methane to n-octane, 2) the potential energy curves\nof H$_2$, CH, and C$_2$ diatomics, 3) the potential energy curves of hydrogen,\nmethane, ethane, and propane dimers, i.e., (H$_2$)$_2$, (CH$_4$)$_2$,\n(C$_2$H$_6$)$_2$, and (C$_3$H$_8$)$_2$, respectively, and 5)\npressure-volume-temperature (PVT) data of a dense high-pressure methane system\nwith the density of 0.5534 g/cc. We compared the atomization energies and\ngeometries of a range of linear alkanes, cycloalkanes, and free radicals\ncalculated from the MEAM potential to those calculated by other commonly used\nreactive potentials for hydrocarbons, i.e., second-generation reactive\nempirical bond order (REBO) and reactive force field (ReaxFF). MEAM reproduced\nthe experimental and/or FP data with accuracy comparable to or better than REBO\nor ReaxFF. The experimental PVT data for a relatively large series of methane,\nethane, propane, and butane systems with different densities were predicted\nreasonably well by MEAM. Although the MEAM formalism has been applied to atomic\nsystems with predominantly metallic bonding in the past, the current work\ndemonstrates the promising extension of the MEAM potential to covalently bonded\nmolecular systems, specifically saturated hydrocarbons and saturated\nhydrocarbon-based polymers.\n", "  Vibrational motions in electronically excited states can be observed by\neither time and frequency resolved infrared absorption or by off resonant\nstimulated Raman techniques. Multipoint correlation function expressions are\nderived for both signals. Three representations for the signal which suggest\ndifferent simulation protocols are developed. These are based on the forward\nand the backward propagation of the wavefunction, sum over state expansion\nusing an effective vibration Hamiltonian and a semiclassical treatment of a\nbath. We show that the effective temporal ($\\Delta t$) and spectral\n($\\Delta\\omega$) resolution of the techniques is not controlled solely by\nexperimental knobs but also depends on the system dynamics being probed. The\nFourier uncertainty $\\Delta\\omega\\Delta t>1$ is never violated.\n", "  The ongoing depletion of fossil fuels has led to an intensive search for\nadditional renewable energy sources. Solar-based technologies could provide\nsufficient energy to satisfy the global economic demands in the near future.\nPhotovoltaic (PV) cells are the most promising man-made devices for direct\nsolar energy utilization. Understanding the charge separation and charge\ntransport in PV materials at a molecular level is crucial for improving the\nefficiency of the solar cells. Here, we use light-induced EPR spectroscopy\ncombined with DFT calculations to study the electronic structure of charge\nseparated states in blends of polymers (P3HT, PCDTBT, and PTB7) and fullerene\nderivatives (C60-PCBM and C70-PCBM). Solar cells made with the same composites\nas active layers show power conversion efficiencies of 3.3% (P3HT), 6.1%\n(PCDTBT), and 7.3% (PTB7), respectively. Under illumination of these\ncomposites, two paramagnetic species are formed due to photo-induced electron\ntransfer between the conjugated polymer and the fullerene. They are the\npositive, P+, and negative, P-, polarons on the polymer backbone and fullerene\ncage, respectively, and correspond to radical cations and radical anions. Using\nthe high spectral resolution of high-frequency EPR (130 GHz), the EPR spectra\nof these species were resolved and principal components of the g-tensors were\nassigned. Light-induced pulsed ENDOR spectroscopy allowed the determination of\n1H hyperfine coupling constants of photogenerated positive and negative\npolarons. The experimental results obtained for the different polymer-fullerene\ncomposites have been compared with DFT calculations, revealing that in all\nthree systems the positive polaron is distributed over distances of 40-60 A on\nthe polymer chain. This corresponds to about 15 thiophene units for P3HT,\napproximately three units PCDTBT, and about three to four units for PTB7. No\nspin density...\n", "  We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of beam formation\nfrom a cryogenic buffer gas cell. Atoms and molecules are loaded into the cell\nby laser ablation of a target, and are cooled and swept out of the cell by a\nflow of cold helium. We study the thermalization and flow dynamics inside the\ncell and measure how the speed, temperature, divergence and extraction\nefficiency of the beam are influenced by the helium flow. We use a finite\nelement model to simulate the flow dynamics and use the predictions of this\nmodel to interpret our experimental results.\n", "  A transferable potential energy function for describing the interaction\nbetween water molecules is presented. The electrostatic interaction is\ndescribed rigorously using a multipole expansion. Only one expansion center is\nused per molecule to avoid the introduction of monopoles. This single center\napproach turns out to converge and give close agreement with ab initio\ncalculations when carried out up to and including the hexadecapole. Both dipole\nand quadrupole polarizability is included. All parameters in the electrostatic\ninteraction as well as the dispersion interaction are taken from ab initio\ncalculations or experimental measurements of a single water molecule. The\nrepulsive part of the interaction is parametrized to fit ab initio calculations\nof small water clusters and experimental measurements of ice Ih. The\nparametrized potential function was then used to simulate liquid water and the\nresults agree well with experiment, even better than simulations using some of\nthe point charge potentials fitted to liquid water. The evaluation of the new\ninteraction potential for condensed phases is fast because point charges are\nnot present and the interaction can, to a good approximation, be truncated at a\nfinite range.\n", "  The electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of are studied by the\nfirst principles and the semiclassical BoltzTrap theory.\n", "  We investigate the microscopic processes leading to graphene growth by the\nchemical vapor deposition of propane in the argon atmosphere at the SiC\nsurface. Experimentally, it is known that the presence of argon fastens the\ndehydrogenation processes at the surface, in high temperature of about 2000K.\nWe perform ab-initio calculations, at zero temperature, to check whether\nchemical reactions can explain this phenomenon. Density functional theory and\nsupporting quantum chemistry methods qualitatively describe formation of the\ngraphene wafers. We find that the 4H-SiC(0001) surface exibits large catalytic\neffect in the adsorption process of hydrocarbon molecules, this is also\nsupported by preliminary molecular dynamics results. Existence of the ArH+\nmolecule, and an observation from the Raman spectra that the negative charge\ntransfers into the SiC surface, would suggest that presence of argon atoms\nleads to a deprotonization on the surface, which is necessary to obtain pure\ncarbon add-layer. But the zero-temperature description shows that the cold\nenvironment is insufficient to promote the argon-assisted surface cleaning.\n", "  Rate constants for the potentially important interstellar N(4S) +\nCH(X2{\\Pi}r) reaction have been measured in a continuous supersonic flow\nreactor over the range 56 K < T < 296 K using the relative rate technique\nemploying both the N(4S) + OH(X2{\\Pi}i) and N(4S) + CN(X2{\\Sigma}+) reactions\nas references. Excess concentrations of atomic nitrogen were produced by the\nmicrowave discharge method upstream of the Laval nozzle and CH and OH radicals\nwere created by the in-situ pulsed laser photolysis of suitable precursor\nmolecules. In parallel, quantum dynamics calculations of the title reaction\nhave been performed based on accurate global potential energy surfaces for the\n13A' and 13A\" states of HCN and HNC, brought about through a hierarchical\nconstruction scheme. Both adiabatic potential energy surfaces are barrierless,\neach one having two deep potential wells suggesting that this reaction is\ndominated by a complex-forming mechanism. The experimental and theoretical work\nare inexcellent agreement, predicting a positive temperature dependence of the\nrate constant, in contrast to earlier experimental work at low temperature. The\neffects of the new low temperature rate constants on interstellar N2 formation\nare tested using a dense cloud model, yielding N2 abundances 10-20 % lower than\npreviously predicted.\n", "  Topological properties of crystalline ice structures are studied by\nconsidering ring statistics, coordination sequences, and topological density of\ndifferent ice phases. The coordination sequences (number of sites at\ntopological distance k from a reference site) have been obtained by direct\nenumeration until at least 40 coordination spheres for different ice\npolymorphs. This allows us to study the asymptotic behavior of the mean number\nof sites in the k-th shell, M_k, for high values of k: M_k ~ a k^2, a being a\nstructure-dependent parameter. Small departures from a strict parabolic\ndependence have been studied by considering first and second differences of the\nseries {M_k} for each structure. The parameter a ranges from 2.00 for ice VI to\n4.27 for ice XII, and is used to define a topological density for these solid\nphases of water. Correlations between such topological density and the actual\nvolume of ice phases are discussed. Ices Ih and Ic are found to depart from the\ngeneral trend in this correlation due to the large void space in their\nstructures.\n", "  We consider diffusion processes with a spatially varying diffusivity giving\nrise to anomalous diffusion. Such heterogeneous diffusion processes are\nanalysed for the cases of exponential, power-law, and logarithmic dependencies\nof the diffusion coefficient on the particle position. Combining analytical\napproaches with stochastic simulations, we show that the functional form of the\nspace-dependent diffusion coefficient and the initial conditions of the\ndiffusing particles are vital for their statistical and ergodic properties. In\nall three cases a weak ergodicity breaking between the time and ensemble\naveraged mean squared displacements is observed. We also demonstrate a\npopulation splitting of the time averaged traces into fast and slow diffusers\nfor the case of exponential variation of the diffusivity as well as a particle\ntrapping in the case of the logarithmic diffusivity. Our analysis is\ncomplemented by the quantitative study of the space coverage, the diffusive\nspreading of the probability density, as well as the survival probability.\n", "  The adsorption geometry of 1,3,5-tris(4-mercaptophenyl)benzene (TMB) on\nCu(111) is determined with high precision using two independent methods,\nexperimentally by quantitative low energy electron diffraction (LEED-I(V)) and\ntheoretically by dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT-vdW).\nStructural refinement using both methods consistently results in similar\nadsorption sites and geometries. Thereby a level of confidence is reached that\nallows deduction of subtle structural details such as molecular deformations or\nrelaxations of copper substrate atoms.\n", "  The absolute density of SD radicals in a supersonic jet has been measured\ndown to $(1.1\\pm0.1)\\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ in a modestly specified apparatus\nthat uses a cross-correlated combination of cavity ring-down and laser-induced\nfluorescence detection. Such a density corresponds to $215\\pm21$ molecules in\nthe probe volume at any given time. The minimum detectable absorption\ncoefficient was quantum-noise-limited and measured to be\n$(7.9\\pm0.6)\\times10^{-11}$ cm$^{-1}$, in 200 s of acquisition time,\ncorresponding to a noise-equivalent absorption sensitivity for the apparatus of\n$(1.6\\pm0.1)\\times10^{-9}$ cm$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$.\n", "  To simulate long time and length scale processes involving DNA it is\nnecessary to use a coarse-grained description. Here we provide an overview of\ndifferent approaches to such coarse graining, focussing on those at the\nnucleotide level that allow the self-assembly processes associated with DNA\nnanotechnology to be studied. OxDNA, our recently-developed coarse-grained DNA\nmodel, is particularly suited to this task, and has opened up this field to\nsystematic study by simulations. We illustrate some of the range of DNA\nnanotechnology systems to which the model is being applied, as well as the\ninsights it can provide into fundamental biophysical properties of DNA.\n", "  We present a simple and non-empirical method to determine optimal scaling\ncoefficients, within the (spin-component)-scaled MP2 approach, for calculating\nintermolecular potential energies of noncovalently-interacting systems. The\nmethod is based on an observed proportionality between (spin-component) MP2 and\nCCSD(T) energies for a wide range of intermolecular distances and allows to\ncompute with high accuracy a large portion of the dissociation curve at the\ncost of a single CCSD(T) calculation. The accuracy of the present procedure is\nassessed for a series of noncovalently-interacting test systems: the obtained\nresults reproduce CCSD(T) quality in all cases and definitely outperform\nconventional MP2, CCSD and SCS-MP2 results. The difficult case of the Beryllium\ndimer is also considered.\n", "  A class of iridium hydrides, IrH_x (x=0.5, 1-4, 6), is calculated at\nab-initio level using the DFT. A number of hydrides are predicted to stabilize\nin the excess hydrogen environment and upon compression. The threshold pressure\nfor thermodynamical stabilization is calculated to ~5 and ~14 GPa at which,\nrespectively, a trihydride (P6_3mc) and a dihydride (Ibam) stabilize with\nrespect to decomposition into pure element. The dihydride (Ibam) is calculated\nto stabilize dynamically at P~14 GPa and the trihydride at P > 25 GPa. In both\nthe di- and trihydride iridium atoms form short directional contacts with\nhydrogens, typical for covalent bonds. The trihydride exhibit molecular\ncharacter and its relative stability is calculated to be higher than that of\nthe dihydride, at least up to approx. 75 GPa.\n", "  We demonstrate a new spectroscopic method for studying electronic transitions\nin molecules with extremely broad range of angular momentum. We employ an\noptical centrifuge to create narrow rotational wave packets in the ground\nelectronic state of $^{16}$O$_2$. Using the technique of resonance-enhanced\nmulti-photon ionization, we record the spectrum of multiple ro-vibrational\ntransitions between $X^3\\Sigma_{g}^{-}$ and $C^3\\Pi_{g}$ electronic manifolds\nof oxygen. Direct control of rotational excitation, extending to rotational\nquantum numbers as high as $N\\gtrsim 120$, enables us to interpret the complex\nstructure of rotational spectra of $C^3\\Pi_{g}$ beyond thermally accessible\nlevels.\n", "  Ionic liquids are widely used as electrolytes in electrochemical devices. In\nthis context, many experimental and theoretical approaches have been recently\ndeveloped for characterizing their interface with electrodes. In this\nperspective article, we review the most recent advances in the field of\ncomputer simulations (mainly molecular dynamics). A methodology for simulating\nelectrodes at constant electrical potential is presented. Several types of\nelectrode geometries have been investigated by many groups in order to model\nplanar, corrugated and porous materials and we summarize the results obtained\nin terms of the structure of the liquids. This structure governs the quantity\nof charge which can be stored at the surface of the electrode for a given\napplied potential, which is the relevant quantity for the highly topical use of\nionic liquids in supercapacitors (also known as electrochemical double-layer\ncapacitors). A key feature, which was also shown by atomic force microscopy and\nsurface force apparatus experiments, is the formation of a layered structure\nfor all ionic liquids at the surface of planar electrodes. This organization\ncannot take place inside nanoporous electrodes, which results in a much better\nperformance for the latter in supercapacitors. The agreement between\nsimulations and electrochemical experiments remains qualitative only though,\nand we outline future directions which should enhance the predictive power of\ncomputer simulations. In the longer term, atomistic simulations will also be\napplied to the case of electron transfer reactions at the interface, enabling\nthe application to a broader area of problems in electrochemistry, and the few\nrecent works in this field are also commented upon.\n", "  The graphene moire structures on metals, as they demonstrate both long\n(moire) and short (atomic) scale ordered structures, are the ideal systems for\nthe application of scanning probe methods. Here we present the complex studies\nof the graphene/Ir(111) system by means of 3D scanning tunnelling and atomic\nforce microscopy/spectroscopy as well as Kelvin-probe force microscopy. All\nresults clearly demonstrate a variation of the moire and atomic scale contrasts\nas a function of the bias voltage as well as the distance between the scanning\nprobe and the sample, allowing to discriminate between topographic and\nelectronic contributions in the imaging of a graphene layer on metals. The\npresented results are accompanied by the state-of-the-art density functional\ntheory calculations demonstrating the excellent agreement between theoretical\nand experimental data.\n", "  We investigate thermodynamic and structural properties of colloidal dumbbells\nin the framework provided by the Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) theory\nof molecular fluids and Monte Carlo simulations. We consider two different\nmodels: in the first one we set identical square-well attractions on the two\ntangent spheres composing the molecule (SW-SW model); in the second scheme, one\nof square-well interactions is switched off (HS-SW model). Appreciable\ndifferences emerge between the physical properties of the two models.\nSpecifically, the $k \\to 0$ behavior of SW-SW structure factors $S(k)$ points\nto the presence of a gas-liquid coexistence, as confirmed by subsequent fluid\nphase equilibria calculations. Conversely, the HS-SW $S(k)$ develops a low-$k$\npeak, signaling the presence of aggregates; such a process destabilizes the\ngas-liquid phase separation, promoting at low temperatures the formation of a\ncluster phase, whose structure depends on the system density. We further\ninvestigate such differences by studying the phase behavior of a series of\nintermediate models, obtained from the original SW-SW by progressively reducing\nthe depth of one square-well interaction. RISM structural predictions\npositively reproduce the simulation data, including the rise of $S(k \\to 0$) in\nthe SW-SW model and the low-$k$ peak in the HS-SW structure factor. As for the\nphase behavior, RISM agrees with Monte Carlo simulations in predicting a\ngas-liquid coexistence for the SW-SW model (though the critical parameters\nappears overestimated by the theory) and its progressive disappearance moving\ntoward the HS-SW model.\n", "  The quantum superposition principle, a key distinction between quantum\nphysics and classical mechanics, is often perceived as a philosophical\nchallenge to our concepts of reality, locality or space-time since it contrasts\nour intuitive expectations with experimental observations on isolated quantum\nsystems. While we are used to associating the notion of localization with\nmassive bodies, quantum physics teaches us that every individual object is\nassociated with a wave function that may eventually delocalize by far more than\nthe body's own extension. Numerous experiments have verified this concept at\nthe microscopic scale but intuition wavers when it comes to delocalization\nexperiments with complex objects. While quantum science is the uncontested\nideal of a physics theory, one may ask if the superposition principle can\npersist on all complexity scales. This motivates matter-wave diffraction and\ninterference studies with large compounds in a three-grating interferometer\nconfiguration which also necessitates the preparation of high-mass nanoparticle\nbeams at low velocities. Here we demonstrate how synthetic chemistry allows us\nto prepare libraries of fluorous porphyrins which can be tailored to exhibit\nhigh mass, good thermal stability and relatively low polarizability, which\nallows us to form slow thermal beams of these high-mass compounds, which can be\ndetected in electron ionization mass spectrometry. We present successful\nsuperposition experiments with selected species from these molecular libraries\nin a quantum interferometer, which utilizes the diffraction of matter waves at\nan optical phase grating. We observe high-contrast quantum fringe patterns with\nmolecules exceeding a mass of 10 000 amu and 810 atoms in a single particle.\n", "  This report is a primarily survey on the chemical nature of some exotic\nspecies containing the positively charged muon and the muonic Helium, i.e., the\nnegatively charged muon plus helium nucleus, as exotic isotopes of hydrogen,\nusing the newly developed multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules\n(MC-QTAIM) analysis, employing ab initio non-Born-Oppenhiemer wavefunctions.\nAccordingly, the \"atoms in molecules\" analysis performed on various asymmetric\nexotic isotopomers of hydrogen molecule, recently detected experimentally\n[Science 331, 448 (2011)], demonstrates that both the exotic isotopes are\ncapable of forming atoms in molecules and retaining the identity of hydrogen\natom. Various derived properties of atomic basins containing muonic helium cast\nno doubt that apart from its short life time, it is a heavier isotope of\nhydrogen while the properties of basins containing the positively charged muon\nare more remote from those of the orthodox hydrogen basins, capable of\nappreciable donation of electrons as well as large charge polarization;\nhowever, with some tolerance, they may be categorized also as hydrogen basins\nthough with a smaller electronegativity. All in all, present study also clearly\ndemonstrates that the MC-QTAIM analysis is an efficient approach to decipher\nthe chemical nature of species containing exotic constituents, hard to be\nelucidated by experimental and/or alternative theoretical schemes.\n", "  Manipulating spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is important for devices such as\nspin-orbit torque based memory and its understanding is neccessary to answer\nseveral fundamental open questions in triplet state superconductivity,\ntopological insulators and Majorana fermions. Here we report spin splitting of\n25 meV at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (110) interface for in-plane spins at a current\ndensity of 1.4x104 A/cm2, which is large compared to that found in\nsemiconductor heterostructures or the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (100) interface, and in\naddition it is anisotropic. The anisotropy arises from the difference in\nelectron effective mass along the [001] and [1-10] directions. Our study\npredicts a spin splitting energy > 1000 meV at a current density of 107 A/cm2,\nwhich is enormous compared to metallic systems and will be an ideal spin\npolarized source. In addition to the in-plane effect, there is an unexpected\ngate-tunable out-of-plane SOC at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (110) interface when the\nspins lie out-of-plane due to broken symmetry in the plane of the interface. We\ndemonstrate that this can be manipulated by varying the LaAlO3 thickness\nshowing that this interface can be engineered for spin-orbit torque devices.\n", "  We report the effects of variation in length on the electronic structure of\nCdSe nanorods derived from atomic clusters and passivated by fictitious\nhydrogen atoms. These nanorods are augmented by attaching gold clusters at both\nthe ends to form a nanodumbbell. The goal is to assess the changes at nanolevel\nafter formation of contacts with gold clusters serving as electrodes and\ncompare the results with experimental observations [PRL, 95, 056805 (2005)].\nCalculations involving nanorods of length 4.6 Angstrom to 116.6 Angstrom are\nperformed using density functional theory implemented within plane-wave basis\nset. The binding energy per atom saturates for nanorod of length 116.6\nAngstrom. It is interesting to note that upon attaching gold clusters, the\nnanorods shorter than 27 Angstrom develop metallicity by means of metal induced\ngap states (MIGS). Longer nanorods exhibit a nanoscale Schottky barrier\nemerging at the center. For these nanorods, interfacial region closest to the\ngold electrodes shows a finite density of states in the gap due to MIGS, which\ngradually decreases towards the center of the nanorod opening up a finite gap.\nBader charge analysis indicates localized charge transfer from metal to\nsemiconductor.\n", "  Glutaraldehyde (GA) reacts with amino groups in proteins, forming\nintermolecular cross-links that, at sufficiently high protein concentration,\ncan transform a protein solution into a gel. Although GA has been used as a\ncross-linking reagent for decades, neither the cross-linking chemistry nor the\nmicrostructure of the resulting protein gel have been clearly established. Here\nwe use small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to characterise the microstructure\nand structural kinetics of gels formed by cross-linking of pancreatic trypsin\ninhibitor, myoglobin or intestinal fatty acid-binding protein. By comparing the\nscattering from gels and dilute solutions, we extract the structure factor and\nthe pair correlation function of the gels. The protein gels are spatially\nheterogeneous, with dense clusters linked by sparse networks. Within the\nclusters, adjacent protein molecules are almost in contact, but the protein\nconcentration in the cluster is much lower than in a crystal. At the $\\sim$1 nm\nSAXS resolution, the native protein structure is unaffected by cross-linking.\nThe cluster radius is in the range 10 - 50 nm, with the cluster size determined\nmainly by the availability of lysine amino groups on the protein surface. The\ndevelopment of structure in the gel, on time scales from minutes to hours,\nappears to obey first-order kinetics. Cross-linking is slower at acidic pH,\nwhere the population of amino groups in the reactive deprotonated form is low.\nThese results support the use of cross-linked protein gels in NMR studies of\nprotein dynamics and for modeling NMR relaxation in biological tissue.\n", "  Laser-assisted chemical vapour deposition (CVD) growth is an attractive\nmask-less process for growing locally aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in\nselected places on temperature sensitive substrates. The nature of the\nlocalized process results in fast carbon nanotube growth with high experimental\nthroughput. Here, we report on detailed investigation of growth kinetics\nrelated to physical and chemical process characteristics. Specifically, the\ngrowth kinetics is investigated by monitoring the dynamical changes of\nreflected laser beam intensity during growth. Benefiting from the fast growth\nand high experimental throughput, we investigate a wide range of experimental\nconditions and propose several growth regimes. Rate-limiting steps are\ndetermined using rate equations linked to the proposed growth regimes, which\nare further characterized by Raman spectroscopy and Scanning Electron\nMicroscopy (SEM), therefore directly linking growth regimes to the structural\nquality of the CNTs. Activation energies for the different regimes are found in\nthe range of 0.3 - 0.8 eV.\n", "  The chemical bond is an important local concept to understand chemical\ncompounds and processes. Unfortunately, like most local concepts, the chemical\nbond and the bond order do not correspond to any physical observable and thus\ncannot be determined as an expectation value of a quantum chemical operator. We\nrecently demonstrated [Boguslawski et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2013, 9,\n2959--2973] that one- and two-orbital-based entanglement measures can be\napplied to interpret electronic wave functions in terms of orbital correlation.\nOrbital entanglement emerged to be a powerful tool to provide a qualitative\nunderstanding of bond-forming and bond-breaking processes, and allowed for an\nestimation of bond orders of simple diatomic molecules beyond the classical\nbonding models. In this article we demonstrate that the orbital entanglement\nanalysis can be extended to polyatomic molecules to understand chemical\nbonding.\n", "  We study model one-dimensional chemical systems (representative of their\nthree-dimensional counterparts) using the strictly-correlated electrons (SCE)\nfunctional, which, by construction, becomes asymptotically exact in the limit\nof infinite coupling strength. The SCE functional has a highly non-local\ndependence on the density and is able to capture strong correlation within\nKohn- Sham theory without introducing any symmetry breaking. Chemical systems,\nhowever, are not close enough to the strong-interaction limit so that, while\nionization energies and the stretched H2 molecule are accurately described,\ntotal energies are in general way too low. A correction based on the exact next\nleading order in the expansion at infinite coupling strength of the\nHohenberg-Kohn functional largely improves the results.\n", "  Monatomic metal (e.g. silver) structures could form preferably at graphene\nedges. We explore their structural and electronic properties by performing\ndensity functional theory based first-principles calculations. The results show\nthat cohesion between metal atoms, as well as electronic coupling between metal\natoms and graphene edges offer remarkable structural stability of the hybrid.\nWe find that the outstanding mechanical properties of graphene allow tunable\nproperties of the metal monatomic structures by straining the structure. The\nconcept is extended to metal rings and helices that form at open ends of carbon\nnanotubes and edges of twisted graphene ribbons. These findings demostrate the\nrole of graphene edges as an efficient one-dimensional template for\nlow-dimensional metal structures that are mechanotunable.\n", "  Co(II) dissolved in acetate buffer at pH 7 is found to be a good water\noxidation catalyst (WOC) showing electrocatalytic water oxidation current\nsignificantly greater than Co(II) in phosphate buffer under the same conditions\nowing to the higher solubility of the former. When electrodeposited on ITO/FTO\nelectrodes it forms acetate bound cobalt(II)oxide based material (Co-Ac-WOC)\nshowing catalytic water oxidation current density of 0.1 mA/cm$^{2}$ at 830 mV\nand 1 mA/cm$^{2}$ at 1 V in a pH 7 buffer solution. The morphology of Co-Ac-OEC\nis investigated with AFM, HR-TEM and SEM (at different times and\nelectrodeposition potentials). The chemical composition of Co-Ac-OEC is\ninvestigated using XPS, EDX, combustion analysis and ATR-FTIR which indicates\nthat this material has a CoO core with chloride and acetate anions bound to the\nCo center. Sodium is found to be integrated in the Co-Ac-WOC. The presence of\nthe sodium ions and the chloride ions lowers the onset potential for oxygen\nevolution reaction (OER) by 240 mV relative to the classic Co-Pi at pH 7. The\nlower onset potential and higher OER current lowers the exchange current\ndensity to 10$^{-6.7}$ in Co-Ac-WOC relative to 10$^{-8}$-10$^{-10}$ in Co-Pi\nand its derivatives.\n", "  The influence of an external electric field on single-layer transition-metal\ndichalcogenides TX2 with T = Mo, W and X = S, Se (MoWSeS) have been\ninvestigated by means of density-functional theory within two-dimensional\nperiodic boundary conditions under consideration of relativistic effects\nincluding the spin-orbit interactions. Our results show that the external field\nmodifies the band structure of the monolayers, in particular the conduction\nband. This modification has, however, very little influence on the band gap and\neffective masses of holes and electrons at the K point, and also the spin-orbit\nsplitting of these monolayers is almost unaffected. Our results indicate a\nremarkable stability of the electronic properties of TX2 monolayers with\nrespect to gate voltages. A reduction of the electronic band gap is observed\nonly starting from field strengths of 2.0 V per {\\AA} (3.5 V per {\\AA}) for\nselenides (sulphides), and the transition to a metallic phase would occur at\nfields of 4.5 V per {\\AA} (6.5 V per {\\AA}).\n", "  We present a theoretical study of degradation mechanisms for photoinduced\noxidation in organic polymers in the condensed phase, using\npoly(3-hexylthiophene)(P3HT) as an example. Applying density functional theory\nwith a hybrid density functional and periodic boundary conditions that account\nfor steric effects and permit the modeling of interchain chemical reactions, we\ninvestigate reaction pathways that may lead to the oxidation of thiophene\nbackbone as a critical step toward disrupting the polymer conjugation. We\ncalculate energy barriers for reactions of the P3HT backbone with oxidizing\nagents including hydroxyl radical (OH$\\cdot$), hydroperoxide (ROOH), and\nperoxyl radical (ROO$\\cdot$), following a UV-driven radical reaction starting\nat the $\\alpha$-carbon of the alkyl side chain as suggested by infrared (IR)\nand X-ray photoemission (XPS) spectrosocopy studies. The results strongly\nsuggest that an attack of OH$\\cdot$ on sulfur in P3HT is unlikely to be\nthermodynamically favored. On the other hand, an attack of a peroxyl radical on\nthe side chain on the P3HT backbone may provide low barrier reaction pathways\nto photodegradation of P3HT and other polymers with side chains. The condensed\nphase setting is found to qualitatively affect predictions of degradation\nprocesses.\n", "  Using ab-initio methods we calculate thermoelectric and spin thermoelectric\nproperties of silicene nanoribbons with bare, mono-hydrogenated and\ndi-hydrogenated edges. Asymmetric structures, in which one edge is either bare\nor di-hydrogenated while the other edge is mono-hydrogenated (0H-1H and 2H-1H\nnanoribbons) have ferromagnetic ground state and display remarkable\nconventional and spin thermoelectric properties. Strong enhancement of the\nthermoelectric efficiency, both conventional and spin ones, results from a very\nspecific band structure of such nanoribbons, where one spin channel is blocked\ndue to an energy gap while the other spin channel is highly conducting. In\nturn, 0H-2H and 2H-2H nanoribbons (with one edge being either bare or\ndi-hydrogenated and the other edge being di-hydrogenated) are antiferromagnetic\nin the ground state. Accordingly, the corresponding spin channels are\nequivalent, and only conventional thermoelectric effects can occur in these\nnanoribbons.\n", "  Controlling spin current and magnetic exchange coupling by applying an\nelectric field and achieving high spin injection efficiency at the same time in\na nanostructure coupled to ferromagnetic electrodes have been the outstanding\nchallenges in nanoscale spintronics. A relentless quest is going on to find new\nlow dimensional materials with tunable spin dependent properties to address\nthese challenges. Herein, we predict, from first principles, the transverse\nelectric field induced switching in the sign of exchange coupling and tunnel\nmagnetoresistance in a boron nitride nanotube quantum dot attached to\nferromagnetic nickel contacts.\n", "  The derivative discontinuity is a key concept in electronic structure theory\nin general and density functional theory in particular. The electronic energy\nof a quantum system exhibits derivative discontinuities with respect to\ndifferent degrees of freedom that are a consequence of the integer nature of\nelectrons. The classical understanding refers to the derivative discontinuity\nof the total energy as a function of the total number of electrons ($N$), but\nit can also manifest at constant $N$. Examples are shown in models including\nseveral Hydrogen systems with varying numbers of electrons or nuclear charge\n($Z$), as well as the 1-dimensional Hubbard model (1DHM). Two sides of the\nproblem are investigated: first, the failure of currently used approximate\nexchange-correlation functionals in DFT and, second, the importance of the\nderivative discontinuity in the exact electronic structure of molecules, as\nrevealed by full configuration interaction (FCI). Currently, all approximate\nfunctionals miss the derivative discontinuity, leading to basic errors that can\nbe seen in many ways: from the complete failure to give the total energy of\nH$_2$ and H$_2^+$, to the missing gap in Mott insulators such as stretched\nH$_2$ and the thermodynamic limit of the 1DHM, or a qualitatively incorrect\ndensity in the HZ molecule with two electrons and incorrect electron transfer\nprocesses. Description of the exact particle behavior of electrons is\nemphasized, which is key to many important physical processes in real systems,\nespecially those involving electron transfer, and offers a challenge for the\ndevelopment of new exchange-correlation functionals.\n", "  Rate constants for the N + C2 reaction have been measured in a continuous\nsupersonic flow reactor over the range 57 K to 296 K by the relative rate\ntechnique employing the N + OH - H + NO reaction as a reference. Excess\nconcentrations of atomic nitrogen were produced by the microwave discharge\nmethod and C2 and OH radicals were created by the in-situ pulsed laser\nphotolysis of precursor molecules C2Br4 and H2O2 respectively. In parallel,\nquantum dynamics calculations were performed based on an accurate global\npotential energy surfaces for the three lowest lying quartet states of the C2N\nmolecule. The 14A\" potential energy surface is barrierless, having two deep\npotential wells corresponding to the NCC and CNC intermediates. Both the\nexperimental and theoretical work show that the rate constant decreases to low\ntemperature, although the experimentally measured values fall more rapidly than\nthe theoretical ones except at the lowest temperatures. Astrochemical\nsimulations indicate that this reaction could be the dominant source of CN in\ndense interstellar clouds.\n", "  We present a computational study into the adsorption properties of CO$_2$ on\namorphous and crystalline water surfaces under astrophysically relevant\nconditions. Water and carbon dioxide are two of the most dominant species in\nthe icy mantles of interstellar dust grains and a thorough understanding of\ntheir solid phase interactions at low temperatures is crucial for understanding\nthe structural evolution of the ices due to thermal segregation. In this paper,\na new H$_2$O-CO$_2$ interaction potential is proposed and used to model the\nballistic deposition of CO$_2$ layers on water ice surfaces, and to study the\nindividual binding sites at low coverages. Contrary to recent experimental\nresults, we do not observe CO$_2$ island formation on any type of water\nsubstrate. Additionally, density functional theory calculations are performed\nto assess the importance of induced electrostatic interactions.\n", "  We construct a manifestly covariant differential Noether charge for theories\nwith Chern-Simons terms in higher dimensional spacetimes. This is in contrast\nto Tachikawa's extension of the standard Lee-Iyer-Wald formalism which results\nin a non-covariant differential Noether charge for Chern-Simons terms. On a\nbifurcation surface, our differential Noether charge integrates to the\nWald-like entropy formula proposed by Tachikawa in arXiv:hep-th/0611141.\n", "  Four-dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories have families of protected\ncorrelation functions that possess the structure of two-dimensional chiral\nalgebras. In this paper, we explore the chiral algebras that arise in this\nmanner in the context of theories of class S. The class S duality web implies\nnontrivial associativity properties for the corresponding chiral algebras, the\nstructure of which is best summarized in the language of generalized\ntopological quantum field theory. We make a number of conjectures regarding the\nchiral algebras associated to various strongly coupled fixed points.\n", "  The electronic structure and conductance of substitutionally edge-doped\nzigzag silicene nanoribbons (ZSiNRs) are investigated using the nonequilibrium\nGreen's function method combined with the density functional theory. Two-probe\nsystems of ZSiNRs in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states are\nconsidered. Doping effects of elements from groups III and V, in a parallel or\nantiparallel magnetic configuration of the two electrodes, are discussed.\nSwitching on and off the external magnetic field, we may convert the metallic\nferromagnetic ZSiNRs into insulating antiferromagnetic ZSiNRs. In the\nferromagnetic state, even- or odd-width ZSiNRs exhibit a drastically different\nmagnetoresistance. In an odd-width edge-doped ZSiNR a large magnetoresistance\noccurs compared to that in a pristine ZSiNR. The situation is reversed in\neven-width ZSiNRs. These phenomena result from the drastic change of the\nconductance in the antiparallel configuration.\n", "  In this work, using the DFT and TDDFT, we have theoretically studied the\nelectronic and optical properties of the two recently synthesized coadsorbents\nY1 and Y2, which were aimed to enhance the efficiency of the black\ndye-sensitized solar cells. To determine the solvatochromic shifts, both the\nimplicit and mixed implicit-explicit models have been used. The connection\nbetween the solvatochromic shifts and the changes of dipole moments in the\nexcitation process is discussed. The difference in excitation charge transfer\nis utilized to explain the experimentally observed difference in $J_{sc}$ for\nY1 and Y2. Investigating the interactions of I$_2$ molecules in the electrolyte\nsolution with the coadsorbents showed that with Y1 the recombination loss was\nweakened through decreasing the I$_2$ concentration near the TiO$_2$ surface,\nwhereas with Y2 it was increased. As a result, the higher values of both\n$J_{sc}$ and $V_{oc}$ with Y1 coadsorbent explains its experimentally observed\nhigher efficiency. The present study sheds light on how to design and engineer\nnewer coadsorbents or organic dyes for higher efficiencies.\n", "  Contrary to common expectation, a left-sneutrinos can occasionally be the\nlightest supersymmet- ric particle. This has important implications in both\ncollider and dark matter studies. We show that same-sign tri-lepton (SS3L)\nevents at the Large Hadron Collider, with any lepton having opposite sign\nvetoed, distinguish such scenarios, up to gluino masses exceeding 2 TeV. The\njets + M ET signal rate is somewhat suppressed in this case, thus enhancing the\nscope of leptonic signals.\n", "  Weak scale supersymmetry (SUSY) remains a prime explanation for the radiative\nstability of the Higgs field. A natural account of the Higgs boson mass,\nhowever, strongly favors extensions of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel (MSSM). A plausible option is to introduce a new supersymmetric sector\ncoupled to the MSSM Higgs fields, whose associated states resolve the little\nhierarchy problem between the third generation squark masses and the weak\nscale. SUSY also accomodates a weakly interacting cold dark matter (DM)\ncandidate in the form of a stable neutralino. In minimal realizations, the\nthus-far null results of direct DM searches, along with the DM relic abundance\nconstraint, introduce a level of fine-tuning as severe as the one due to the\nSUSY little hierarchy problem. We analyse the generic implications of new SUSY\nsectors parametrically heavier than the minimal SUSY spectrum, devised to\nincrease the Higgs boson mass, on this little neutralino DM problem. We focus\non the SUSY operator of smallest scaling dimension in an effective field theory\ndescription, which modifies the Higgs and DM sectors in a correlated manner.\nWithin this framework, we show that recent null results from the LUX experiment\nimply a tree-level fine-tuning for gaugino DM which is parametrically at least\na few times larger than that of the MSSM. Higgsino DM whose relic abundance is\ngenerated through a thermal freeze-out mechanism remains also severely\nfine-tuned, unless the DM lies below the weak boson pair-production threshold.\nAs in the MSSM, well-tempered gaugino-Higgsino DM is strongly disfavored by\npresent direct detection results.\n", "  We analyze non-Higgsable clusters of gauge groups and matter that can arise\nat the level of geometry in 4D F-theory models. Non-Higgsable clusters seem to\nbe generic features of F-theory compactifications, and give rise naturally to\nstructures that include the nonabelian part of the standard model gauge group\nand certain specific types of potential dark matter candidates. In particular,\nthere are nine distinct single nonabelian gauge group factors, and only five\ndistinct products of two nonabelian gauge group factors with matter, including\n$SU(3) \\times SU(2)$, that can be realized through 4D non-Higgsable clusters.\nThere are also more complicated configurations involving more than two gauge\nfactors; in particular, the collection of gauge group factors with jointly\ncharged matter can exhibit branchings, loops, and long linear chains.\n", "  Based on extensive Monte Carlo simulations and analytical considerations we\nstudy the electrostatically driven adsorption of flexible polyelectrolyte\nchains onto charged Janus nanospheres. These net-neutral colloids are composed\nof two equally but oppositely charged hemispheres. The critical binding\nconditions for polyelectrolyte chains are analysed as function of the radius of\nthe Janus particle and its surface charge density, as well as the salt\nconcentration in the ambient solution. Specifically for the adsorption of\nfinite-length polyelectrolyte chains onto Janus nanoparticles, we demonstrate\nthat the critical adsorption conditions drastically differ when the size of the\nJanus particle or the screening length of the electrolyte are varied. We\ncompare the scaling laws obtained for the adsorption-desorption threshold to\nthe known results for uniformly charged spherical particles, observing\nsignificant disparities. We also contrast the changes to the polyelectrolyte\nchain conformations and the binding energy distributions close to the\nadsorption-desorption transition for Janus nanoparticles to those for simple\nspherical particles. Finally, we discuss experimentally relevant\nphysico-chemical systems for which our simulations results may become\nimportant. In particular, we observe similar trends with polyelectrolyte\ncomplexation with oppositely but heterogeneously charged proteins.\n", "  We investigate neutrino mass matrix phenomenology involving scaling ansatz\nand texture zeros adhering inverse seesaw mechanism. It is seen that four is\nthe maximum number of zeros in $m_D$ and $\\mu$ to obtain viable phenomenology.\nDepending upon the generic nature of the effective neutrino mass matrices we\nclassify all the emerged matrices in four categories. One of them is ruled out\nphenomenologically due to inappropriate value of reactor mixing angle after\nbreaking of the scaling ansatz. The mass ordering is inverted in all cases. One\nof the distinguishable feature of all these categories is the vanishingly small\nvalue of CP violation measure $J_{CP}$ due to small value of $\\delta_{CP}$.\nThus those categories will be ruled out if CP violation is observed in the\nleptonic sector in future experiments.\n", "  Field theories with weakly coupled holographic duals, such as large N gauge\ntheories, have a natural separation of their operators into `single-trace\noperators' (dual to single-particle states) and `multi-trace operators' (dual\nto multi-particle states). There are examples of large N gauge theories where\nthe beta functions of single-trace coupling constants all vanish, but marginal\nmulti-trace coupling constants have non-vanishing beta functions that spoil\nconformal invariance (even when all multi-trace coupling constants vanish). The\nholographic dual of such theories should be a classical solution in anti-de\nSitter space, in which the boundary conditions that correspond to the\nmulti-trace coupling constants depend on the cutoff scale, in a way that spoils\nconformal invariance. We argue that this is realized through specific bulk\ncoupling constants that lead to a running of the multi-trace coupling\nconstants. This fills a missing entry in the holographic dictionary.\n", "  We construct new black brane solutions in $U(1)$ gauged ${\\cal N}=2$\nsupergravity with a general cubic prepotential, which have entropy density\n$s\\sim T^{1/3}$ as $T \\rightarrow 0$ and thus satisfy the Nernst Law. By using\nthe real formulation of special geometry, we are able to obtain analytical\nsolutions in closed form as functions of two parameters, the temperature $T$\nand the chemical potential $\\mu$. Our solutions interpolate between\nhyperscaling violating Lifshitz geometries with $(z,\\theta)=(0,2)$ at the\nhorizon and $(z,\\theta)=(1,-1)$ at infinity. In the zero temperature limit,\nwhere the entropy density goes to zero, we recover the extremal Nernst branes\nof Barisch et al, and the parameters of the near horizon geometry change to\n$(z,\\theta)=(3,1)$.\n", "  The phase structure of ABJM theory with mass $m$ deformation and\nnon-vanishing Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) parameter, $\\zeta$, is studied through the\nuse of localisation on ${\\mathbb S}^3$. The partition function of the theory\nthen reduces to a matrix integral, which, in the large $N$ limit and at large\nsphere radius, is exactly computed by a saddle-point approximation. When the\ncouplings are analytically continued to real values, the phase diagram of the\nmodel becomes immensely rich, with an infinite series of third-order phase\ntransitions at vanishing FI-parameter. As the FI term is introduced, new\neffects appear. For any given $0 < \\zeta < m/2$, the number of phases is finite\nand for $\\zeta\\geq m/2$ the theory does not have any phase transitions at all.\n  Finally, we argue that ABJM theory with physical couplings does not undergo\nphase transitions and investigate the case of $U(2)\\times U(2)$ gauge group in\ndetail by an explicit calculation of the partition function.\n", "  A two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) is one of the minimal extensions of the\nStandard Model (SM), and it is well-known that the general setup predicts the\nflavor-violating phenomena, mediated by neutral Higgs interactions. Recently\nthe CMS collaboration has reported an excess of the lepton-flavor-violating\nHiggs decay in $h \\rightarrow \\mu \\tau$ channel with a significance of 2.5 $\n\\sigma$. We investigate the CMS excess in a general 2HDM with tree-level Flavor\nChanging Neutral Currents (FCNCs), and discuss its impact on the other physical\nobservations. Especially, we see that the FCNCs relevant to the excess can\nenhance the neutral Higgs contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment,\nand can resolve the discrepancy between the measured value and the SM\nprediction. We also find that the couplings to be consistent with the muon g-2\nanomaly as well as the CMS excess in $h\\rightarrow \\mu\\tau$ predict the sizable\nrate of $ \\tau \\rightarrow \\mu \\gamma$, which is within the reach of future B\nfactory.\n", "  We summarize the foliation approach to ${\\cal N}=1$ compactifications of\neleven-dimensional supergravity on eight-manifolds $M$ down to $\\mathrm{AdS}_3$\nspaces for the case when the internal part $\\xi$ of the supersymmetry generator\nis chiral on some proper subset ${\\cal W}$ of $M$. In this case, a topological\nno-go theorem implies that the complement $M\\setminus {\\cal W}$ must be a dense\nopen subset, while $M$ admits a singular foliation ${\\bar {\\cal F}}$ (in the\nsense of Haefliger) which is defined by a closed one-form $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$\nand is endowed with a longitudinal $G_2$ structure. The geometry of this\nfoliation is determined by the supersymmetry conditions. We also describe the\ntopology of ${\\bar {\\cal F}}$ in the case when $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ is a Morse\nform.\n", "  We perform lattice simulations of two-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory with sixteen supercharges with a lattice action which has two exact\nsupercharges (Sugino lattice action). According to the gauge/gravity duality,\nthe theory at finite temperature is expected to be well described by the\ncorresponding black 1-branes, at low temperature in the large N limit. We aim\nto confirm the duality conjecture by comparing the lattice results with the\ntheoretical predictions obtained in the gravity side. In this article, at the\nbeginning of this study, we examine the supersymmetric Ward-Takahashi identity\nto test whether the lattice action reproduces the correct continuum theory.\nNumerical results of the SUSY WTI strongly suggest us that any cut-off effects,\nwhich break supersymmetry, disappear in the continuum limit. In addition, we\nstudy the issue of degenerate vacua and find that the admissiblilty condition\nor any other constraints of the link fields which guarantee the unique vacuum\nare not always needed.\n", "  Spacetime Virasoro and affine Lie algebras for strings propagating in AdS3\nare known to all orders in $\\alpha'$. The central extension of such algebras is\na string vertex, whose expectation value can depend on the number of long\nstrings present in the background but should be otherwise state-independent. In\nhep-th/0106004, on the other hand, a state-dependent expectation value was\nfound. Another puzzling feature of the theory is lack of cluster decomposition\nproperty in certain connected correlators. This note shows that both problems\ncan be removed by defining the free energy of the spacetime boundary conformal\nfield theory as the Legendre transform of the formula proposed in the\nliterature. This corresponds to pass from a canonical ensemble, where the\nnumber of fundamental strings that create the background can fluctuate, to a\nmicrocanonical one, where it is fixed.\n", "  We introduce local filters as a means to detect the entanglement of bound\nentangled states which do not yield to detection by witnesses based on positive\n(P) maps which are not completely positive (CP). We demonstrate how such\nnon-detectable bound entangled states can be locally filtered into detectable\nbound entangled states. Specifically, we show that a bound entangled state in\nthe orthogonal complement of the unextendible product bases (UPB), can be\nlocally filtered into a another bound entangled state that is detectable by the\nChoi map. We reinterpret these filters as local measurements on locally\nextended Hilbert spaces. We give explicit constructions of a measurement-based\nimplementation of these filters for $2 \\otimes 2$ and $3 \\otimes 3$ systems.\nThis provides us with a physical mechanism to implement such local filters.\n", "  The issues of electronic polarizability in molecular dynamics simulations are\ndiscussed. We argue that the charges of ionized groups in proteins, and charges\nof ions in conventional non-polarizable force fields such as CHARMM, AMBER,\nGROMOS, etc should be scaled by a factor about 0.7. Our model explains why a\nneglect of electronic solvation energy, which typically amounts to about a half\nof total solvation energy, in non-polarizable simulations with un-scaled\ncharges can produce a correct result; however, the correct solvation energy of\nions does not guarantee the correctness of ion-ion pair interactions in many\nnon-polarizable simulations. The inclusion of electronic screening for charged\nmoieties is shown to result in significant changes in protein dynamics and can\ngive rise to new qualitative results compared with the traditional\nnon-polarizable force field simulations. The model also explains the striking\ndifference between the value of water dipole $\\mu$~3D reported in recent ab\ninitio and experimental studies with the value $\\mu_{eff}$~2.3D typically used\nin the empirical potentials, such as TIP3P or SPC/E. It is shown that the\neffective dipole of water can be understood as a scaled value\n$\\mu_{eff}=\\mu/\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{el}}$, where $\\epsilon_{el}$=1.78 is the\nelectronic (high-frequency) dielectric constant of water. This simple\ntheoretical framework provides important insights into the nature of the\neffective parameters, which is crucial when the computational models of liquid\nwater are used for simulations in different environments, such as proteins, or\nfor interaction with solutes.\n", "  In this paper the properties of dark solitons in superfluid Fermi gases with\nspin-imbalance are studied by means of a recently developed effective field\ntheory [S. N. Klimin, J. Tempere, G. Lombardi, J. T. Devreese, Eur. Phys. J. B\n88, 122 (2015)] suitable to describe the BEC-BCS crossover in ultracold gases\nin an extended range of temperatures as compared to the usual Ginzburg-Landau\ntreatments. The spatial profiles for the total density and for the density of\nthe excess-spin component, and the changes of their properties across the\nBEC-BCS crossover are examined in different conditions of temperature and\nimbalance. The presence of population imbalance is shown to strongly affect the\nstructure of the soliton excitation by filling its core with unpaired atoms.\nThis in turn influences the dynamical properties of the soliton since the\nadditional particles in the core have to be dragged along thus altering the\neffective mass.\n", "  Persistent homology (PH) is a method used in topological data analysis (TDA)\nto study qualitative features of data that persist across multiple scales. It\nis robust to perturbations of input data, independent of dimensions and\ncoordinates, and provides a compact representation of the qualitative features\nof the input. The computation of PH is an open area with numerous important and\nfascinating challenges. The field of PH computation is evolving rapidly, and\nnew algorithms and software implementations are being updated and released at a\nrapid pace. The purposes of our article are to (1) introduce theory and\ncomputational methods for PH to a broad range of computational scientists and\n(2) provide benchmarks of state-of-the-art implementations for the computation\nof PH. We give a friendly introduction to PH, navigate the pipeline for the\ncomputation of PH with an eye towards applications, and use a range of\nsynthetic and real-world data sets to evaluate currently available open-source\nimplementations for the computation of PH. Based on our benchmarking, we\nindicate which algorithms and implementations are best suited to different\ntypes of data sets. In an accompanying tutorial, we provide guidelines for the\ncomputation of PH. We make publicly available all scripts that we wrote for the\ntutorial, and we make available the processed version of the data sets used in\nthe benchmarking.\n", "  We investigate two transport coefficients, shear viscosity and conductivity,\nin a non-relativistic boundary filed theory without hyperscaling symmetry,\nwhich is dual to a bulk charged hyperscaling violating black brane. Employing\nmatching method, we obtain that the ratio of shear viscosity and the entropy\ndensity is alway $1/4\\pi$ at any temperature, which satisfies the\nKovtun-Starinets-Son (KSS) bound. Besides, we also present the universal\nformulas of AC conductivity, which is closely dependent on the relation between\ngeometrical parameters $z$ and $\\theta$. The optical conductivity at high\nfrequency limit behaves with a (non)-power law scaling or approaches to be\nconstant, depending on the choice of $z$ and $\\theta$. This feature is\ndifferent from the observes in Lifshitz black brane that the optical\nconductivity always complies with a (non)-power law scaling in high frequency\nlimit when the Lifshitz exponent $z>1$. We also argue that the temperate has no\nprint on the exponent of (non)-power law scaling in large frequency while it\nwill affect the strength of conductivity at low frequency.\n", "  Deterministic optical quantum logic requires a nonlinear quantum process that\nalters the phase of a quantum optical state by $\\pi$ through interaction with\nonly one photon. Here, we demonstrate a large conditional cross-phase\nmodulation between a signal field, stored inside an atomic quantum memory, and\na control photon that traverses a high-finesse optical cavity containing the\natomic memory. This approach avoids fundamental limitations associated with\nmultimode effects for traveling optical photons. We measure a conditional\ncross-phase shift of up to $\\pi/3$ between the retrieved signal and control\nphotons, and confirm deterministic entanglement between the signal and control\nmodes by extracting a positive concurrence. With a moderate improvement in\ncavity finesse, our system can reach a coherent phase shift of $\\pi$ at low\nloss, enabling deterministic and universal photonic quantum logic.\n", "  Bayesian inference techniques are used to investigate situations where an\nadditional light scalar field is present during inflation and reheating. This\nincludes (but is not limited to) curvaton-type models. We design a numerical\npipeline where $\\simeq 200$ inflaton setups $\\times\\, 10$ reheating scenarios\n$= 2000$ models are implemented and we present the results for a few\nprototypical potentials. We find that single-field models are remarkably robust\nunder the introduction of light scalar degrees of freedom. Models that are\nruled out at the single-field level are not improved in general, because good\nvalues of the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio can only be\nobtained for very fine-tuned values of the extra field parameters and/or when\nlarge non-Gaussianities are produced. The only exception is quartic large-field\ninflation, so that the best models after Planck are of two kinds: plateau\npotentials, regardless of whether an extra field is added or not, and quartic\nlarge-field inflation with an extra light scalar field, in some specific\nreheating scenarios. Using Bayesian complexity, we also find that more\nparameters are constrained for the models we study than for their single-field\nversions. This is because the added parameters not only contribute to the\nreheating kinematics but also to the cosmological perturbations themselves, to\nwhich the added field contributes. The interplay between these two effects lead\nto a suppression of degeneracies that is responsible for having more\nconstrained parameters.\n", "  Wetting behaviour of surfaces is believed to be affected by van der Waals\n(vdW) forces, however, there is no clear demonstration of this. With the\nisolation of two-dimensional vdW layered materials it is possible to test this\nhypothesis. In this paper, we report the wetting behaviour of vdW\nheterostructures which include, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown graphene,\nmolybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) on few layers of\nhexagon boron nitride (h-BN) and SiO2/Si. Our study clearly shows that while\nthis class of two-dimensional materials are not wetting transparent, there\nseems to be a significant amount of influence on their wetting properties by\nthe underlying substrate due to dominant vdW forces. Contact angle measurements\nindicate that graphene and graphene-like layered transitional metal\ndichalcogenides invariably have intrinsically dispersive surfaces with a\ndominating London-vdW force-mediated wettability. Electric field controlled\nwetting studies of MoS2/WS2/SiO2/Si heterostructures were performed and no\nnotable changes to the water contact angle was seen with applied voltage\nalthough two orders of magnitude change in resistance was observed. We\npostulate that the highly dispersive nature of these surfaces arising from the\npredominant London-vdW forces could be the reason for such observation.\n", "  The magnetic nature of the B-site dopants controls the magnetic phases in\nB-site doped manganites RE$_{1-x}$AE$_{x}$Mn$_{1-\\eta}$B$_{\\eta}$O$_3$.\nDifferent B-site dopants of equal valence, doped into the same reference\nmanganite, lead to different magnetic phases at low temperature, which can not\nbe explained using the valence change scenario. We focus on trivalent B-site\ndopants in CE-CO-OO-I manganites at half-filling $x=0.50$ to study the role of\nmagnetic interactions between the B-site dopants and the neighboring Mn-sites\nby using a two-orbital double-exchange model including super-exchange\ninteractions, Jahn-Teller lattice distortions and substitutional disorder in\ntwo dimensions. We show that the magnetic reconstructions around the B-site\ndopants due to the modified double-exchange and super-exchange interactions\ncontrol the phase competition in B-site doped manganites.\n", "  We study the pairing dynamics of polar states in a single species p-wave\nsuperfluid Fermi gas following a sudden change of the interaction strength. The\nanisotropy of pair interaction together with the presence of the centrifugal\nbarrier results in profoundly different pairing dynamics compared to the s-wave\ncase. Depending on the direction of quenches, quench to the BCS regime results\nin a large oscillatory depletion of momentum occupation inside the Fermi sea or\na large filling of momentum occupation. We elucidate a crucial role of the\nresonant state supported by the centrifugal barrier in the pairing dynamics.\n", "  Multi-photon system has been studied by many groups, however the biggest\nchallenge faced is the number of copies of an unknown state are limited and far\nfrom detecting quantum entanglement. The difficulty to prepare copies of the\nstate is even more serious for the quantum state tomography. One possible way\nto solve this problem is to use adaptive quantum state tomography, which means\nto get a preliminary density matrix in the first step and revise it in the\nsecond step. In order to improve the performance of adaptive quantum state\ntomography, we develop a new distribution scheme of samples and extend it to\nthree steps, that is to correct it once again based on the density matrix\nobtained in the traditional adaptive quantum state tomography. Our numerical\nresults show that the mean square error of the reconstructed density matrix by\nour new method is improved to the level from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-9}$ for several\ntested states. In addition, PhaseLift is also applied to reduce the required\nstorage space of measurement operator.\n", "  Motivated by the notions of $k$-extendability and complete extendability of\nthe state of a finite level quantum system as described by Doherty et al (Phys.\nRev. A, 69:022308), we introduce parallel definitions in the context of\nGaussian states and using only properties of their covariance matrices derive\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for their complete extendability. It turns\nout that the complete extendability property is equivalent to the separability\nproperty of a bipartite Gaussian state.\n  Following the proof of quantum de Finetti theorem as outlined in Hudson and\nMoody (Z. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verw. Gebiete, 33(4):343--351), we\nshow that separability is equivalent to complete extendability for a state in a\nbipartite Hilbert space where at least one of which is of dimension greater\nthan 2. This, in particular, extends the result of Fannes, Lewis, and Verbeure\n(Lett. Math. Phys. 15(3): 255--260) to the case of an infinite dimensional\nHilbert space whose C* algebra of all bounded operators is not separable.\n", "  In this article we explore the dynamics of a Brownian particle in a\nfeedback-free dynamic thermophoretic trap. The trap contains a focused laser\nbeam heating a circular gold structure locally and creating a repulsive thermal\npotential for a Brownian particle. In order to confine a particle the heating\nbeam is steered along the circumference of the gold structure leading to a\nnon-trivial motion of the particle. We theoretically find a stability condition\nby switching to a rotating frame, where the laser beam is at rest. Particle\ntrajectories and stable points are calculated as a function of the laser\nrotations frequency and are experimentally confirmed. Additionally, the effect\nof Brownian motion is considered. The present study complements the dynamic\nthermophoretic trapping with a theoretical basis and will enhance the\napplicability in micro- and nanofluidic devices.\n", "  We describe an extension of the SOFTSUSY spectrum calculator to include\ntwo-loop supersymmetric QCD (SUSYQCD) corrections of order\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ to gluino and squark pole masses, either in the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) or the next-to-minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model (NMSSM). This document provides an overview of\nthe program and acts as a manual for the new version of SOFTSUSY, which\nincludes the increase in accuracy in squark and gluino pole mass predictions.\n", "  We devise a new 1D atomistic scale model of vicinal growth based on Cellular\nAutomaton. In it the step motion is realized by executing the automaton rule\nprescribing how adatoms incorporate into the vicinal crystal. Time increases\nafter each rule execution and then nDS diffusional updates of the adatoms are\nperformed. The increase of nDS switches between the diffusion-limited (DL,\nnDS=1) and kinetics-limited (KL, nDS >> 1) regimes of growth. We study the\nunstable step motion by employing two alternative sources of instability -\nbiased diffusion and infinite inverse Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier (iiSE). The\nresulting step bunches consist of steps but also of macrosteps since there is\nno step-step repulsion incorporated explicitly into the model. This complex\npattern formation is quantified by studying the time evolution of the bunch\nsize N and macrostep size Nm in order to find the proper parameter combinations\nthat rescale the time and thus to obtain the full time-scaling relations\nincluding the pre-factors. For the case of biased diffusion the time-scaling\nexponent beta of N is 1/2 while for the case of iiSE it is 1/3. In both cases\nthe time-scaling exponent beta_m of Nm is ~3beta/4 in the DL regime and 3beta/5\nin the KL one.\n", "  We present a new technique to reduce the expected number of measurements to\ndeclare an unknown quantum state as entangled. Our method is based on the\ngeometric criterion and so requires only local Pauli measurements. Using\nconcentration of measure, we provide a heuristic which allows us to reinterpret\na previous decision tree algorithm due to Laskowski et al and that forms the\nbasis for our new algorithm. Numerical simulations show that for three to six\nqubits we use fewer measurements than either the trivial algorithm or the\ndecision tree algorithm. In addition, our method is easy to construct, assumes\nno prior knowledge of the system and works for any number of qubits.\n", "  Linear polarization angle, $\\theta$, dependent measurements of the microwave\nradiation-induced oscillatory magnetoresistance, $R_{xx}$, in high mobility\nGaAs/AlGaAs 2D electron devices have shown a $\\theta$ dependence in the\noscillatory amplitude along with magnetic field, frequency, and\nextrema-dependent phase shifts, $\\theta_{0}$. Here, we suggest a microwave\nfrequency dependence of $\\theta_{0} (f)$ using an analysis that averages over\nother smaller contributions, when those contributions are smaller than\nestimates of the experimental uncertainty.\n", "  We propose a generic mechanism for the emergence of a gravitational potential\nthat acts on all classical objects in a quantum system. Our conjecture is based\non the analysis of mutual information in many-body quantum systems. Since\nmeasurements in quantum systems affect the surroundings through entanglement, a\nmeasurement at one position reduces the entropy in its neighbourhood. This\nreduction in entropy can be described by a local temperature, that is directly\nrelated to the gravitational potential. A crucial ingredient in our argument is\nthat ideal classical mechanical motion occurs at constant probability. This\ndefinition is motivated by the analysis of entropic forces in classical\nsystems, which can be formally rewritten in terms of a gravitational potential.\n", "  We investigate the instanton effects on the heavy-quark potential,including\nits spin-dependent part, based on the instanton liquid model. Starting with the\ncentral potential derived from the instanton vacuum, we obtain the\nspin-dependent part of the heavy-quark potential. We discuss the results of the\nheavy-quark potential from the instanton vacuum. We finally solve the\nnonrelativistic two-body problem, associating with the heavy-quark potential\nfrom the instanton vacuum. The instanton effects on the quarkonia spectra are\nmarginal but are required for quantitative description of the spectra.\n", "  Amorphous vanadium dioxide (VO$_{2}$) films deposited by atomic layer\ndeposition (ALD) were crystallized with an ex situ anneal at 660-670 ${\\deg}$C\nfor 1-2 hours under a low oxygen pressure (10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-5}$ Torr). Under\nthese conditions the crystalline VO$_{2}$ phase was maintained, while formation\nof the V$_{2}$O$_{5}$ phase was suppressed. Electrical transition from the\ninsulator to the metallic phase was observed in the 37-60 ${\\deg}$C range, with\na R$_{ON}$/R$_{OFF}$ ratio of up to about 750 and critical transition\ntemperature of 7-10 ${\\deg}$C. Electric field applied across two-terminal\ndevice structures induced a reversible phase change, with a room temperature\ntransition field of about 25 kV/cm in the VO$_{2}$ sample processed with the 2\nhr long anneal. Both the width and slope of the field induced MIT hysteresis\nwere dependent upon the VO$_{2}$ crystalline quality.\n", "  Obtaining a detailed understanding of strong-field double ionisation of\nmany-electron systems (heavy atoms and molecules) remains a challenging task.\nBy comparing experimental and theoretical results in the mid-IR regime, we have\nunambiguously identified the transition from non-sequential (e,2e) to\nsequential double ionisation in Xe and shown that it occurs at an intensity\nbelow $10^{14}$ Wcm$^{-2}$. In addition, our data demonstrate that ionisation\nfrom the Xe 5s orbital is decisive at low intensities. Moreover, using the\nacetylene molecule, we propose how sequential double ionisation in the mid-IR\ncan be used to study molecular dynamics and fragmentation on unprecedented\nfew-femtosecond timescales.\n", "  We study of the ultrafast dynamics of the atomic angular momentum in\nferrimagnets irradiated by laser pulses. My apply a quantum atomistic spin\napproach based on the Monte Carlo technique. Our model describes the coherent\ntransfer of angular momentum between the spin and the orbital momentum as well\nas the quenching of the orbital momentum induced by the lattice field. The\nElliott-Yafet collision mechanism is also included. We focus on elementary\nmechanisms that lead to the dissipation of the total angular momentum in a rare\nearth-transition metal (RE-TM) alloy in which the two sublattices have opposite\nspin orientation. Our model shows that the observed ultrafast quenching of the\nmagnetization can be explained microscopically by the transfer of spin between\nthe sublattices and by the quenching of the localized orbital angular momentum.\n", "  One of the central challenges in the study of quantum many-body systems is\nthe complexity of simulating them on a classical computer. A recent advance of\nLandau et al. gave a polynomial time algorithm to actually compute a succinct\nclassical description for unique ground states of gapped 1D quantum systems.\nDespite this progress many questions remained unresolved, including whether\nthere exist rigorous efficient algorithms when the ground space is degenerate\n(and poly($n$) dimensional), or for the poly($n$) lowest energy states for 1D\nsystems, or even whether such states admit succinct classical descriptions or\narea laws.\n  In this paper we give a new algorithm for finding low energy states for 1D\nsystems, based on a rigorously justified RG type transformation. In the process\nwe resolve some of the aforementioned open questions, including giving a\npolynomial time algorithm for poly($n$) degenerate ground spaces and an\n$n^{O(\\log n)}$ algorithm for the poly($n$) lowest energy states for 1D systems\n(under a mild density condition). We note that for these classes of systems the\nexistence of a succinct classical description and area laws were not rigorously\nproved before this work. The algorithms are natural and efficient, and for the\ncase of finding unique ground states for frustration-free Hamiltonians the\nrunning time is $\\tilde{O}(nM(n))$, where $M(n)$ is the time required to\nmultiply two $n\\times n$ matrices.\n", "  In this work we consider magnetic reconnection in thin current sheets with\nboth resistive and electron inertia effects. When the current sheet is produced\nby a primary instability of the internal kink type, the analysis of secondary\ninstabilities indicates that reconnection proceeds on a time scale much shorter\nthan the primary instability characteristic time. In the case of a sawtooth\ncrash, non-collisional physics becomes important above a value of the Lundquist\nnumber which scales like S ~ (R/d_e)^{12/5}, in terms of the tokamak major\nradius R and of the electron skin depth d_e. This value is commonly achieved in\npresent day devices. As collisionality is further reduced, the characteristic\nrate increases, approaching Alfv\\'enic values when the primary instability\napproaches the collisionless regime.\n", "  This paper focuses on the connection of holomorphic two-dimensional\nfactorization algebras and vertex algebras which has been made precise in the\nforthcoming book of Costello-Gwilliam. We provide a construction of the\nVirasoro vertex algebra starting from a local Lie algebra on the complex plane.\nMoreover, we discuss an extension of this factorization algebra to a\nfactorization algebra on the category of Riemann surfaces. The factorization\nhomology of this factorization algebra is computed as are the correlation\nfunctions. We provide an example of how the Virasoro factorization algebra\nimplements conformal symmetry of the beta-gamma system using the method of\neffective BV quantization.\n", "  This paper presents a fast method for global search of atomic structures at\nab initio level. The structures global optimization (SGO) engine consists of a\nhigh-efficiency differential evolution algorithm, accelerated local relaxation\nmethods and an ultrafast plane-wave density functional theory code run on GPU\nmachines. It can search the global-minimum configurations of crystals,\ntwo-dimensional materials and quantum clusters without symmetry restriction in\na very short time (half or several hours). The engine is also able to search\nthe energy landscape of a given system, which is useful for exploration of\nmaterials properties for emerging applications. The exploration of carbon\nmonolayer and platinum atomic clusters found several new stable configurations.\n", "  We study highest weight representations of the Borel subalgebra of the\nquantum toroidal gl(1) algebra with finite-dimensional weight spaces. In\nparticular, we develop the q-character theory for such modules. We introduce\nand study the subcategory of `finite type' modules. By definition, a module\nover the Borel subalgebra is finite type if the Cartan like current \\psi^+(z)\nhas a finite number of eigenvalues, even though the module itself can be\ninfinite dimensional.\n  We use our results to diagonalize the transfer matrix T_{V,W}(u;p) analogous\nto those of the six vertex model. In our setting T_{V,W}(u;p) acts in a tensor\nproduct W of Fock spaces and V is a highest weight module over the Borel\nsubalgebra of quantum toroidal gl(1) with finite-dimensional weight spaces.\nNamely we show that for a special choice of finite type modules $V$ the\ncorresponding transfer matrices, Q(u;p) and T(u;p), are polynomials in u and\nsatisfy a two-term TQ relation. We use this relation to prove the Bethe Ansatz\nequation for the zeroes of the eigenvalues of Q(u;p). Then we show that the\neigenvalues of T_{V,W}(u;p) are given by an appropriate substitution of\neigenvalues of Q(u;p) into the q-character of V.\n", "  A hollow cylindrical micron-scale structure is proposed to enhance and\nmanipulate the laser plasma interaction. It is shown through 3-D\nparticle-in-cell simulations that the incident laser pulse intensity is\nenhanced within the tube. A detailed study of the intensification optimizes the\ntube dimensions and provides a characterization of the in-tube intensity. By\ncoupling the micro-tube plasma lens to a traditional flat interface, we show an\nincrease in on-target intensity. We detail proton energy enhancement as a\npotential application of the micro-tube plasma lens target, where the tube\nstructure acts to focus the light and provide additional electrons that enhance\nthe accelerating sheath field.\n", "  We investigate a biaxial Bianchi IX model with positive cosmological\nconstant, which is sometimes called the Lambda-Taub-NUT spacetime, whose exact\nsolution is well known. The minisuperspace of biaxial Bianchi IX models admits\ntwo non-trivial Killing tensors that play an important role for deriving the\nTaub-NUT metric. We also give a brief discussion about the asymptotic behaviour\nof Bianchi IX models.\n", "  We propose a model for the dS/CFT correspondence. The model is constructed in\nterms of a \"Yang-Baxter operator\" $R$ for unitary representations of the\ndeSitter group $SO(d,1)$. This $R$-operator is shown to satisfy the Yang-Baxter\nequation, unitarity, as well as certain analyticity relations, including in\nparticular a crossing symmetry. With the aid of this operator we construct: a)\nA chiral (light-ray) conformal quantum field theory whose internal degrees of\nfreedom transform under the given unitary representation of $SO(d,1)$. By\nanalogy with the $O(N)$ non-linear sigma model, this chiral CFT can be viewed\nas propagating in a deSitter spacetime. b) A (non-unitary) Euclidean conformal\nquantum field theory on ${\\mathbb R}^{d-1}$, where $SO(d,1)$ now acts by\nconformal transformations in (Euclidean) spacetime. These two theories can be\nviewed as dual to each other if we interpret ${\\mathbb R}^{d-1}$ as conformal\ninfinity of deSitter spacetime. Our constructions use semi-local generator\nfields defined in terms of $R$ and abstract methods from operator algebras.\n", "  The rotation ${\\rm polar}(F) \\in {\\rm SO}(3)$ arises as the unique orthogonal\nfactor of the right polar decomposition $F = {\\rm polar}(F) \\cdot U$ of a given\ninvertible matrix $F \\in {\\rm GL}^+(3)$. In the context of nonlinear elasticity\nGrioli (1940) discovered a geometric variational characterization of ${\\rm\npolar}(F)$ as a unique energy-minimizing rotation. In preceding works, we have\nanalyzed a generalization of Grioli's variational approach with weights\n(material parameters) $\\mu > 0$ and $\\mu_c \\geq 0$ (Grioli: $\\mu = \\mu_c$). The\nenergy subject to minimization coincides with the Cosserat shear-stretch\ncontribution arising in any geometrically nonlinear, isotropic and quadratic\nCosserat continuum model formulated in the deformation gradient field $F :=\n\\nabla\\varphi: \\Omega \\to {\\rm GL}^+(3)$ and the microrotation field $R: \\Omega\n\\to {\\rm SO}(3)$. The corresponding set of non-classical energy-minimizing\nrotations $$\n  {\\rm rpolar}^\\pm_{\\mu,\\mu_c}(F) := \\substack{{\\rm argmin}\\\\ R\\,\\in\\,{\\rm\nSO(3)}}\n  \\Big\\{ W_{\\mu, \\mu_c}(R\\,;F) := \\mu\\, || {\\rm sym}(R^TF - 1)||^2 + \\mu_c\\,\n||{\\rm skew}(R^TF - 1)||^2 \\Big\\} $$ represents a new relaxed-polar mechanism.\nOur goal is to motivate this mechanism by presenting it in a relevant setting.\nTo this end, we explicitly construct a deformation mapping $\\varphi_{\\rm nano}$\nwhich models an idealized nanoindentation and compare the corresponding optimal\nrotation patterns ${\\rm rpolar}^\\pm_{1,0}(F_{\\rm nano})$ with experimentally\nobtained 3D-EBSD measurements of the disorientation angle of lattice rotations\ndue to a nanoindentation in solid copper. We observe that the non-classical\nrelaxed-polar mechanism can produce interesting counter-rotations. A possible\nlink between Cosserat theory and finite multiplicative plasticity theory on\nsmall scales is also explored.\n", "  We prove the second law of thermodynamics and the nonequilibirum fluctuation\ntheorem for pure quantum states.The entire system obeys reversible unitary\ndynamics, where the initial state of the heat bath is not the canonical\ndistribution but is a single energy-eigenstate that satisfies the\neigenstate-thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Our result is mathematically\nrigorous and based on the Lieb-Robinson bound, which gives the upper bound of\nthe velocity of information propagation in many-body quantum systems. The\nentanglement entropy of a subsystem is shown connected to thermodynamic heat,\nhighlighting the foundation of the information-thermodynamics link. We\nconfirmed our theory by numerical simulation of hard-core bosons, and observed\ndynamical crossover from thermal fluctuations to bare quantum fluctuations. Our\nresult reveals a universal scenario that the second law emerges from quantum\nmechanics, and can experimentally be tested by artificial isolated quantum\nsystems such as ultracold atoms.\n", "  Eigenfunctions of the Schrodinger equation with the Coulomb potential in the\nimaginary Lobachevsky space are studied in two coordinate systems admitting\nsolutions in terms of hypergeometric functions. Normalization and coefficients\nof mutual expansions for some sets of solutions are found.\n", "  The classical Kepler-Coulomb problem on the single-sheeted hyperboloid\n$H^{3}_1$ is solved in the framework of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. We have\nproven that all the bounded orbits are closed and periodic. The paths are\nellipses or circles for finite motion.\n", "  We demonstrate how a quantum Otto engine (QOE) can be implemented using a\nsingle ion and an always-on thermal environment. The internal degree of freedom\nof the ion is chosen as the working fluid, while the motional degree of freedom\ncan be used as the cold bath. We show, that by adiabatically changing the local\nmagnetic field, the work efficiency can be asymptotically made unity. We\npropose a projective measurement of the internal state of the ion that mimics\nthe release of heat into the cold bath during the engine cycle. In our\nproposal, the coupling to the hot and the cold baths need not be switched off\nand on in an alternative fashion during the engine cycle, unlike other existing\nproposals of QOE. This renders the proposal experimentally feasible using the\navailable tapped-ion engineering technology.\n", "  In this work we investigate the effects of the short range magnetic\ncorrelations on the gap opening of the topological Kondo insulators. We\nconsider an additional narrow band to the otherwise completely localized\nf-electrons, by adding a term to the periodic Anderson model which allows a\nsmall hopping of the localized electrons between neighboring sites of the\nlattice. This new model is adequate to study a novel class of intermetallic 4f\nand 5f orbitals materials: the Kondo topological insulators, whose paradigmatic\nmaterial is the compound SmB6.\n  For simplicity, we consider a version of the periodic Anderson model on a two\ndimensional square lattice. The starting point of the model is the 4f-Ce ions\norbitals, with J=5/2 multiplet in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We\npresent results of the correlation functions and we show that the short range\nantiferromagnetic correlations favors the formation of magnetic moments on the\natoms, and at the same time the existence of these moments opens the\npossibility of the spin-flip scattering by the conduction electrons, generating\nthe Kondo effect, which contribute to the opening of a gap in the density of\nstates of the system. We also calculate the phase diagram which shows that, as\nwe vary the Ef level position from the empty regime to the Kondo regime, the\nsystem develops several phases: metallic, band insulator and Kondo topological\ninsulator. The band structure calculated shows that the model develops a strong\ntopological insulator.\n", "  We study the optical properties of an ensemble of two-level atoms coupled to\na 1D photonic crystal waveguide (PCW), which mediates long-range coherent\ndipole-dipole interactions between the atoms. We show that the long-range\ninteractions can dramatically alter the linear and nonlinear optical behavior,\nas compared to a typical atomic ensemble. In particular, in the linear regime,\nwe find that the transmission spectrum reveals multiple transmission dips,\nwhose properties we show how to characterize. In the many-photon regime the\nsystem response can be highly non-linear, and under certain circumstances the\nensemble can behave like a single two-level system, which is only capable of\nabsorbing and emitting a single excitation at a time. Our results are of direct\nrelevance to atom-PCW experiments that should soon be realizable.\n", "  We present a novel approach to enhancing the bandwidth of a\nfeedback-controlled mechanical system by digitally canceling acoustical\nresonances (poles) and anti-resonances (zeros) in the open-loop response via an\nFPGA FIR filter. By performing a real-time convolution of the feedback error\nsignal with an inverse filter, we can suppress arbitrarily many poles and zeros\nbelow 100 kHz, each with a linewidth down to 10 Hz. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof this technique by canceling the ten largest mechanical resonances and\nanti-resonances of a high-finesse optical resonator, thereby enhancing the\nunity gain frequency by more than an order of magnitude. This approach is\napplicable to a broad array of stabilization problems including optical\nresonators, external cavity diode lasers, and scanning tunneling microscopes,\nand points the way to applying modern optimal control techniques to intricate\nlinear acoustical systems.es to intricate linear acoustical systems.\n", "  The path decomposition expansion represents the propagator of the\nirreversible reaction as a convolution of the first-passage, last-passage and\nrebinding time probability densities. Using path integral technique, we give an\nelementary, yet rigorous, proof of the path decomposition expansion of the\nGreen's functions describing the non-reactive case and the irreversible\nreaction of an isolated pair of molecules. To this end, we exploit the\nconnection between boundary value problems and interaction potential problems\nwith $\\delta$- and $\\delta'$-function perturbation. In particular, we employ a\nknown exact summation of a perturbation series to derive exact relations\nbetween the Green's functions of the perturbed and unperturbed problem. Along\nthe way, we are able to derive a number of additional exact identities that\nrelate the propagators describing the free-space, the non-reactive as well as\nthe completely and partially reactive case.\n", "  An efficient reflective elastic metasurface with tunable focusing point is\nproposed. The metasurface is based on electric resonators embedded in a\nstretchable elastic substrate. The focal length is controlled by mean of the\nstretching applied applied to the sample. The results predicted by theory and\nnumerical simulations are experimentally verified. Our proposal shows that\nsmart engineering elastic metamaterials are an effective platform for new\nfunctional devices based on metamaterials.\n", "  In this paper, we show that the Chen-Nester-Tung (CNT) quasi-local energy is\nclosely related to the Wang-Yau (WY) quasi-local mass. As a particular example,\nwe compute the second variation of the CNT quasi-local energy for axially\nsymmetric Kerr-like spacetimes with axially symmetric embeddings at the obvious\ncritical point (0,0) and find that it is a saddle critical point in most of the\ncases. Also, as a byproduct, we generalize a previous result about the\ncoincidence of CNT quasi-local energy and Brown-York mass for Kerr-like\nspacetimes by Tam and the first author to general spacetimes.\n", "  By solving the non-relativistic Abraham-Lorentz (AL) equation, I demonstrate\nthat AL equation of motion is not suited for treating the Lorentz atom, because\na steady-state solution does not exist. The AL equation serves as a tool,\nhowever, for deducing appropriate parameters $\\Omega,\\Gamma$ to be used with\nthe equation of forced oscillations in modelling the Lorentz atom. The electric\npolarizability, which many authors \"derived\" from AL equation in recent years,\nis found to violate Kramers-Kronig relations rendering obsolete the extracted\nphoton-absorption rate, for example. Fortunately, errors turn out to be small\nquantitatively, as long as light frequency $\\omega$ is neither too close to nor\ntoo far from resonance frequency $\\Omega$. Polarizability and absorption cross\nsection are derived for the Lorentz atom by purely classical reasoning and\nshown to agree with quantum-mechanical calculations of the same quantities. In\nparticular, oscillator parameters $\\Omega,\\,\\Gamma$ deduced by treating the\natom as a quantum oscillator are found equivalent to those derived from\nclassical AL equation. The instructive comparison provides a deep insight into\nunderstanding the great success of Lorentz's model which was suggested long\nbefore the advent of quantum theory.\n", "  In order to explain the fermions masses and mixing parameters appearing in\nthe lepton sector of the Standard Model, one proposes the extension of its\nsymmetry. A discrete, non-abelian subgroup of $U(3)$ is added to the gauge\ngroup $SU(3)_{C}\\times SU(2)_{L}\\times U(1)_{Y}$ . Apart from that, one assumes\nthe existence of one extra Higgs doublet. This article focuses mainly on the\nmathematical theorems and computational techniques which brought us to the\nresults.\n", "  A new scheme for the short baseline electron antineutrino (${\\bar{\\nu}}_{e}$)\ndisappearance study is investigated. We propose to use an intense neutron\nemitter, $^{252}$Cf, which produces $^{8}$Li isotope through the\n$^{7}$Li(n,$\\gamma$)$^{8}$Li reaction; $^{8}$Li is a ${\\bar{\\nu}}_{e}$ emitter\nvia $\\beta^{-}$ decay. Because this ${\\bar{\\nu}}_{e}$ source needs neither\naccelerator nor reactor facilities, the ${\\bar{\\nu}}_{e}$ can be placed on any\nneutrino detectors as closely as possible. This short baseline circumstance\nwith a suitable detector enables us to study the existence of possible sterile\nneutrinos, in particular, on 1 eV mass scale. Also, complementary comparison\nstudies among different neutrino detectors can become feasible by using\n${\\bar{\\nu}}_{e}$ from the $^{8}$Li source. As an example, applications to\nhemisphere and cylinder shape scintillator detectors are performed in detail\nwith the expectation signal modification by the sterile neutrino. Sensitivities\nto mass and mixing angles of sterile neutrinos are also presented for\ncomparison with those of other neutrino experiments.\n", "  Fire whirls are powerful, spinning disasters for people and surroundings when\nthey occur in large urban and wildland fires. While fire whirls have long been\nstudied for fire safety applications, previous research has yet to harness\ntheir potential burning efficiency for enhanced combustion. This paper presents\nlaboratory studies of fire whirls initiated as pool fires, but where the fuel\nsits on a water surface, seeding an idea of exploiting the high-efficiency of\nfire whirls for oil-spill remediation. We show the transition from a pool fire,\nto a fire whirl, and then to a previously unobserved state, a blue whirl. A\nblue whirl is smaller, very stable, and burns completely blue-violet in a\nhydrocarbon flame, indicating soot-free burning. The combination of fast mixing\nand the water-surface boundary creates the conditions leading to nearly\nsoot-free combustion. With the worldwide need to reduce emissions from both\nwanted and unwanted combustion, discovery of this new state points to new\npathways for highly efficient and low-emission energy production and fuel-spill\ncleanup. Because current methods to generate a stable vortex are difficult, we\nalso propose that the blue whirl may serve as a research platform for\nfundamental studies of vortices in fluid mechanics.\n", "  We present a model independent, operator algebraic approach to\nnon-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics within the framework of two-dimensional\nConformal Field Theory. Two infinite reservoirs in equilibrium at their own\ntemperatures and chemical potentials are put in contact through a defect line,\npossibly by inserting a probe. As time evolves, the composite system then\napproaches a non-equilibrium steady state that we describe. In particular, we\nre-obtain recent formulas of Bernard and Doyon.\n", "  Stochastic process exhibiting power-law slopes in the frequency domain are\nfrequently well modeled by fractional Brownian motion (fBm). In particular, the\nspectral slope at high frequencies is associated with the degree of small-scale\nroughness or fractal dimension. However, a broad class of real-world signals\nhave a high-frequency slope, like fBm, but a plateau in the vicinity of zero\nfrequency. This low-frequency plateau, it is shown, implies that the temporal\nintegral of the process exhibits diffusive behavior, dispersing from its\ninitial location at a constant rate. Such processes are not well modeled by\nfBm, which has a singularity at zero frequency corresponding to an unbounded\nrate of dispersion. A more appropriate stochastic model is a much lesser-known\nrandom process called the Matern process, which is shown herein to be a damped\nversion of fractional Brownian motion. This article first provides a thorough\nintroduction to fractional Brownian motion, then examines the details of the\nMatern process and its relationship to fBm. An algorithm for the simulation of\nthe Matern process in O(N log N) operations is given. Unlike fBm, the Matern\nprocess is found to provide an excellent match to modeling velocities from\nparticle trajectories in an application to two-dimensional fluid turbulence.\n", "  The valence fluctuations which are related to the charge disproportionation\nof phosphorous ions $P^{4+} + P^{4+}\\rightarrow P^{3+} + P^{5+}$ are the origin\nof ferroelectric and quantum paraelectric states in Sn(Pb)$_2$P$_2$S$_6$\nsemiconductors. They involve recharging of SnPS$_3$ or PbPS$_3$ structural\ngroups which could be represented as half-filled sites in the crystal lattice.\nTemperature-pressure phase diagram for Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ compound and\ntemperature-composition phase diagram for (Pb$_y$Sn$_{1-y}$)$_2$P$_2$S$_6$\nmixed crystals, which include tricritical points and where a temperature of\nphase transitions decrease to 0 K, together with the data about some softening\nof low energy optic phonons and rise of dielectric susceptibility at cooling in\nquantum paraelectric state of Pb$_2$P$_2$S$_6$, are analyzed by GGA electron\nand phonon calculations and compared with electronic correlations models. The\nanharmonic quantum oscillators model is developed for description of phase\ndiagrams and temperature dependence of dielectric susceptibility.\n", "  The $B\\to K^*\\mu\\mu$ decay exhibits deviations with respect to Standard Model\nexpectations and the measurement of the ratio $R_K$ hints at a violation of\nlepton-flavour universality in $B\\to K\\ell\\ell$ transitions. Both effects can\nbe understood in model-independent fits as a short-distance contribution to the\nWilson coefficient $C_{9\\mu}$, with some room for similar contributions in\nother Wilson coefficients for $b\\to s\\mu\\mu$ transitions. We discuss how a full\nangular analysis of $B\\to K^*ee$ and its comparison with $B\\to K^*\\mu\\mu$ could\nimprove our understanding of these anomalies and help confirming their\ninterpretation in terms of short-distance New Physics. We discuss several\nobservables of interest in this context and provide predictions for them within\nthe Standard Model as well as within several New Physics benchmark scenarios.\nWe pay special attention to the sensitivity of these observables to hadronic\nuncertainties from SM contributions with charm loops.\n", "  Faceted interfaces are a key feature in self-resembling morphologies of many\nmicrostructures generated from solid state phase transformations.\nInterpretations, predictions and simulations of the faceted morphologies remain\na challenge, especially for systems in which irrational orientation\nrelationships (ORs) between two phases and irrational interface orientations\n(IOs) are preferred. In terms of structural singularities, this work suggests\nan integrated framework, which possibly encompasses all candidates of faceted\ninterfaces. The structural singularities are identified in a matching pattern,\na dislocation structure and/or a ledge structure. The resultant singular\ninterfaces are discrete IOs, described with low index g's (rational\norientations) and/or Delta-g's (either rational or irrational orientations).\nElimination of defects exerts restrictions on the OR and the lattice\nparameters. Various models are grouped according to their determined results\nregarding the OR and IO, and the links between the models are clarified in the\nintegrated framework. An irrational IO is usually due to elimination of\ndislocations in one direction, i.e., an O-line interface. Analytical methods\nusing both 3D and 2D models for quantitative determinations of O-line\ninterfaces are reviewed, and a detailed example showing the calculation for an\nirrational interface is given. The association between structural singularities\nand local energy minima is verified by atomistic calculations of interfacial\nenergies in fcc/bcc alloys where it is found that the calculated equilibrium\ncross-sections are in a good agreement with observations from selected alloys.\n", "  Light-matter interactions can be dramatically modified by the surrounding\nenvironment. Here we report on the first experimental observation of molecular\nspontaneous emission inside a highly nonlocal metamaterial based on a plasmonic\nnanorod assembly. We show that the emission process is dominated not only by\nthe topology of its local effective medium dispersion, but also by the nonlocal\nresponse of the composite, so that metamaterials with different geometric\nparameters but the same local effective medium properties exhibit different\nPurcell factors. A record-high enhancement of a decay rate is observed, in\nagreement with the developed quantitative description of the Purcell effect in\na nonlocal medium. An engineered material nonlocality introduces an additional\ndegree of freedom into quantum electrodynamics, enabling new applications in\nquantum information processing, photo-chemistry, imaging, and sensing.\n", "  Motivated by the physics of strings and branes, we develop a class of Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms involving extended objects. Starting from a\ncollection of parallel Metropolis-Hastings (MH) samplers, we place them on an\nauxiliary grid, and couple them together via nearest neighbor interactions.\nThis leads to a class of \"suburban samplers\" (i.e., spread out Metropolis).\nCoupling the samplers in this way modifies the mixing rate and speed of\nconvergence for the Markov chain, and can in many cases allow a sampler to more\neasily overcome free energy barriers in a target distribution. We test these\ngeneral theoretical considerations by performing several numerical experiments.\nFor suburban samplers with a fluctuating grid topology, performance is strongly\ncorrelated with the average number of neighbors. Increasing the average number\nof neighbors above zero initially leads to an increase in performance, though\nthere is a critical connectivity with effective dimension d_eff ~ 1, above\nwhich \"groupthink\" takes over, and the performance of the sampler declines.\n", "  The constraints from the measurements of the $B\\to X_s\\gamma$ decay rate on\nthe parameter space of 3-Higgs Doublet Models (3HDMs), where all the doublets\nhave non-zero vacuum expectation values, are studied at the next-to-leading\norder in QCD. In order to naturally avoid the presence of flavour changing\nneutral currents at the tree level, we impose two softly-broken discrete $Z_2$\nsymmetries. This gives rise to five independent types of 3HDMs that differ in\ntheir Yukawa couplings. We show that in all these 3HDMs (including the case of\ntype-II-like Yukawa interactions) both masses of the two charged Higgs bosons\n$m_{H_1^\\pm}$ and $m_{H_2^\\pm}$ can be smaller than the top mass $m_t$ while\ncomplying with the constraints from $B\\to X_s\\gamma$. As an interesting\nphenomenological consequence, the branching ratios of the charged Higgs bosons\ndecay into the $cb$ final states can be as large as $80\\%$ when their masses\nare taken to be below $m_t$ in two of the five 3HDMs (named as Type-Y and\nType-Z). This light charged Higgs boson scenario provides a hallmark 3HDM\nsignature that cannot be realised in $Z_2$ symmetric 2-Higgs doublet models. We\nfind that in the Type-Y and Type-Z 3HDMs the scenario with $90\\,{\\rm GeV}<\nm_{H^\\pm_1}^{}\\,, m_{H^\\pm_2}^{}<m_t$ is ruled out by the direct searches at\nthe LHC, but in the Type-Y 3HDM $80~\\text{GeV}<m_{H_1^\\pm}^{}<90~\\text{GeV}$\nand $90~\\text{GeV}<m_{H_2^\\pm}^{}<m_t$ is allowed by $B\\to X_s\\gamma$ and\ndirect searches at LEP2, Tevatron and LHC due to the reduced sensitivity of\nthese searches to the degenerate case $m_{H_1^\\pm}\\approx m_{W^\\pm}$. The cases\nwhere only one or both charged Higgs bosons are above the top quark mass are\nalso naturally allowed in the both Type-Y and Type-Z 3HDMs.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce the concepts of the large deviations theorem of\nweaker types, i.e., type I, type I', type II, type II', type III, and type\nIII', and present a systematic study of the ergodic and chaotic properties of\ndynamical systems satisfying the large eviations theorem of various types. Some\ncharacteristics of the ergodic measure are obtained and then applied to prove\nthat every dynamical system satisfying the large deviations theorem of type I'\nis ergodic, which is equivalent to the large deviations theorem of type II' in\nthis regard, and that every uniquely ergodic dynamical system restricted on its\nsupport satisfies the large deviations theorem. Moreover, we prove that every\ndynamical system satisfying the large deviations theorem of type III is an\n$E$-system. Finally, we show that a dynamical system satisfying the central\nlimit theorem, introduced in [Y. Niu, Y. Wang, Statist. Probab. Lett., {\\bf 80}\n(2010), 1180--1184], does not exist.\n", "  Brownian dynamics simulations are an increasingly popular tool for\nunderstanding spatially-distributed biochemical reaction systems. Recent\nimprovements in our understanding of the cellular environment show that volume\nexclusion effects are fundamental to reaction networks inside cells. These\nsystems are frequently studied by incorporating inert hard spheres (crowders)\ninto three-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations, however these methods are\nextremely slow owing to the sheer number of possible collisions between\nparticles. Here we propose a rigorous \"crowder-free\" method to dramatically\nincrease simulation speed for crowded biochemical reaction systems by\neliminating the need to explicitly simulate the crowders. We consider both the\ncase where the reactive particles are point particles, and where they\nthemselves occupy a volume. We use simulations of simple chemical reaction\nnetworks to confirm that our simplification is just as accurate as the original\nalgorithm, and that it corresponds to a large speed increase.\n", "  We consider a dark sector consisting of dark matter that is a Dirac fermion\nand a scalar mediator. This model has been extensively studied in the past. If\nthe scalar couples to the dark matter in a parity conserving manner then dark\nmatter annihilation to two mediators is dominated by the P-wave channel and\nhence is suppressed at very low momentum. The indirect detection constraint\nfrom the anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background is usually thought to be\nabsent in the model because of this suppression. In this letter we show that\ndark matter annihilation to bound states occurs through the S-wave and hence\nthere is a constraint on the parameter space of the model from the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background.\n", "  The Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox highlights several strange properties of\nquantum mechanics including the super position of states, the non locality and\nits limitation to determine an experiment only statistically. Here, this well\nknown paradox is revisited theoretically for a pair of spin 1/2 systems in a\nsinglet state under the assumption that in classical physics time evolves in\ndiscrete time steps Deltat while in quantum mechanics the individual spin\nsystem(s) evolve(s) between the eigenstates harmonically with a period of 4\nDeltat. It is further assumed that time is a single variable, that the quantum\nmechanics time evolution and the classical physics discrete time evolution are\ncoherent to each other, and that the precision of the start of the experiment\nand of the measurement time point are much less than Deltat. Under these\nconditions, it is demonstrated for a spin 1/2 system that the fast oscillation\nbetween the eigen states spin up and spin down reproduces the expected outcome\nof a single measurement as well as ensemble measurements without the need of\npostulating a simultaneous superposition of the spin system in its quantum\nstate. When this concept is applied to a spin 1/2 system pair in a singlet\nstate it is shown that no entanglement between the two spins is necessary to\ndescribe the system resolving the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox.\n", "  We show that by combining the elementary-Goldstone-Higgs scenario and\nsupersymmetry it is possible to raise the scale of supersymmetry breaking to\nseveral TeVs by relating it to the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking one. This is\nachieved by first enhancing the global symmetries of the super-Higgs sector to\nSU(4) and then embedding the electroweak sector and the Standard-Model\nfermions. We determine the conditions under which the model achieves a vacuum\nsuch that the resulting Higgs is a pseudo-Goldstone boson. The main results\nare: the supersymmetry-breaking scale is identified with the\nspontaneous-symmetry-breaking scale of SU(4) which is several TeVs above the\nradiatively induced electroweak scale; intriguingly the global symmetry of the\nHiggs sector predicts the existence of two super-Higgs multiplets with one mass\neigenstate playing the role of the pseudo-Goldstone Higgs; the\nsymmetry-breaking dynamics fixes $\\tan \\beta = 1$ and requires a supplementary\nsinglet chiral superfield. We finally discuss the spectrum of the model that\nnow features superpartners of the Standard-Model fermions and gauge bosons in\nthe multi-TeV range.\n", "  A discovery of neutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay would be profound, providing\nthe first direct experimental evidence of $\\Delta L=2$ lepton number violating\nprocesses. While a natural explanation is provided by an effective Majorana\nneutrino mass, other new physics interpretations should be carefully evaluated.\nAt low--energies such new physics could manifest itself in the form of color\nand $SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_{Y}$ invariant higher dimension operators. Here we\ndetermine a complete set of electroweak invariant dimension--9 operators, and\nour analysis supersedes those that only impose $U(1)_{em}$ invariance. Imposing\nelectroweak invariance implies: 1) a significantly reduced set of leading order\noperators compared to only imposing $U(1)_{em}$ invariance; and 2) other\ncollider signatures. Prior to imposing electroweak invariance we find a minimal\nbasis of 24 dimension-9 operators, which is reduced to 11 electroweak invariant\noperators at leading order in the expansion in the Higgs vacuum expectation\nvalue. We set up a systematic analysis of the hadronic realization of the\n4-quark operators using chiral perturbation theory, and apply it to determine\nwhich of these operators have long-distance pion enhancements at leading order\nin the chiral expansion. We also find at dimension--11 and dimension--13 the\nelectroweak invariant operators that after electroweak symmetry breaking\nproduce the remaining $\\Delta L=2$ operators that would appear at dimension--9\nif only $U(1)_{em}$ is imposed.\n", "  Novel ion traps that provide either a static or a dynamic magnetic gradient\nfield allow for the use of radio frequency (rf) radiation for coupling internal\nand motional states of ions, which is essential for conditional quantum logic.\nWe show that the coupling mechanism in the presence of a dynamic gradient is\nthe same, in a dressed state basis, as in the case of a static gradient. Then,\nit is shown how demanding experimental requirements arising when using a\ndynamic gradient could be overcome. Thus, using dressed states in a dynamic\ngradient field could decisively reduce experimental complexity on the route\ntowards a scalable device for quantum information science based on rf-driven\ntrapped ions.\n", "  We study the signature of scale invariance in the far-from-equilibrium\nquantum dynamics of two dimensional Bose gases. We show that the density\nprofile displays a scale invariant logarithmic singularity near the center. In\naddition, the density oscillates due to quantum beats with universal\nstructures. Namely, the frequencies of the beats can be connected with one\nanother by a universal discrete scale transformation induced by the scale\ninvariance. The experimental applicability of these results is then discussed.\n", "  Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we\ndiscuss some novel features of a two (1+1)-dimensional (2D) non-Abelian 1-form\ngauge theory (without any interaction with matter fields). Besides the usual\noff-shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommutating (anti-)BRST symmetry\ntransformations, we discuss the off-shell nilpotent and absolutely\nanticommutating (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations. Particularly, we lay\nemphasis on the existence of the coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities\nof the 2D non-Abelian theory in view of the presence of (anti-)co-BRST symmetry\ntransformations where we pin-point some novel features associated with the\nCurci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions. We demonstrate that these CF-type\nrestrictions can be incorporated into the (anti-)co-BRST invariant Lagrangian\ndensities through the fermionic Lagrange multipliers which carry specific ghost\nnumbers. The modified versions of the Lagrangian densities (where we get rid of\nthe new CF-type restrictions) respect some precise symmetries as well as a\ncouple of symmetries with CF-type constraints. These observations are\ncompletely novel as far as the BRST formalism, with proper (anti-)co-BRST\nsymmetries, is concerned.\n", "  A complete set of the Virasoro and W-constraints for the Kontsevich-Penner\nmodel, which conjecturally describes intersections on moduli spaces of open\ncurves, was derived in our previous work. Here we show that these constraints\ncan be described in terms of free bosonic fields with twisted boundary\nconditions, which gives a modification of the well-known construction of the\n$W^{(3)}$ algebra in conformal field theory. This description is natural from\nthe point of view of the spectral curve description, and should serve as a new\nimportant ingredient of the topological recursion/Givental decomposition.\n", "  We present a study on the charge current quasi elastic scattering of\n$\\nu_\\mu$ from nucleon and nuclei which gives a charged muon in the final\nstate. To describe nuclei, the Fermi Gas model has been used with proposed\nPauli suppression factor. The diffuseness parameter of the Fermi distribution\nhas been obtained using experimental data. We also investigate different\nparametrizations for electric and magnetic Sach's form factors of nucleons.\nCalculations have been made for CCQES total and differential cross sections for\nthe cases of $\\nu_{\\mu}-N$, $\\nu_{\\mu}-^{12}C$ and $\\nu_{\\mu}-^{56}Fe$\nscatterings and are compared with the data for different values of the axial\nmass. The present model gives excellent description of measured differential\ncross section for all the systems.\n", "  In this paper we demonstrate that massless particles cannot be considered as\nlimiting case of massive particles. Instead, the usual symmetry structure based\non semisimple groups like $U(1)$, $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ has to be replaced by\nless usual solvable groups like the minimal nonabelian group ${\\rm sol}_2$.\nStarting from the proper orthochronous Lorentz group ${\\rm Lor}_{1,3}$ we\nextend Wigner's little group by an additional generator, obtaining the maximal\nsolvable or Borel subgroup ${\\rm Bor}_{1,3}$ which is equivalent to the\nKronecker sum of two copies of ${\\rm sol}_2$, telling something about the\nhelicity of particle and antiparticle states.\n", "  We present a code implementing the linearized self-consistent quasiparticle\nGW method (scQPGW) in the LAPW basis. Our approach is based on the\nlinearization of the self-energy around zero frequency which differs it from\nthe existing implementations of the scQPGW method. The linearization allows us\nto use Matsubara frequencies instead of real ones. As a result it gives us an\nadvantage in terms of efficiency, allowing us easily switch to the imaginary\ntime representation the same way as in the space time method. The all electron\nLAPW basis set eliminates the need for pseudopotentials. We discuss the\nadvantages of our approach, such as its N^3 scaling with the system size, as\nwell as its shortcomings.\n  We apply our approach to study electronic properties of selected\nsemiconductors, insulators, and simple metals and show that our code produces\nresults very close to the previously published scQPGW data. Our implementation\nis a good platform for further many body diagrammatic resummations such as\nGW+DMFT.\n", "  The Weak Gravity Conjecture postulates the existence of superextremal charged\nparticles, i.e. those with mass smaller than or equal to their charge in Planck\nunits. We present further evidence for our recent observation that in known\nexamples a much stronger statement is true: an infinite tower of superextremal\nparticles of different charges exists. We show that effective Kaluza-Klein\nfield theories and perturbative string vacua respect the Sublattice Weak\nGravity Conjecture, namely that a finite index sublattice of the full charge\nlattice exists with a superextremal particle at each site. In perturbative\nstring theory we show that this follows from modular invariance. However, we\npresent counterexamples to the stronger possibility that a superextremal\nparticle exists at every lattice site, including an example in which the\nlightest charged particle is subextremal. The Sublattice Weak Gravity\nConjecture has many implications both for abstract theories of quantum gravity\nand for real-world physics. For instance, it implies that if a gauge group with\nvery small coupling $e$ exists, then the fundamental gravitational cutoff\nenergy of the theory is no higher than $\\sim e^{1/3} M_{\\rm Pl}$.\n", "  We report on magneto-optical imaging, magnetization, Hall effect and\nmagneto-resistance experiments in Nb/Al_2O_3/Co thin film heterostructures. The\nmagnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the plane of the film and gives\nrise to abrupt flux penetration of dendritic form. A magnetization texture is\nimprinted in the Co layer in perfect coincidence with these ramifications. The\nspin domains that mimic the vortex dendrites are stable upon the field removal.\nMoreover, the imprinted spin structure remains visible up to room temperature.\nComplementary magnetization, Hall effect and magneto-resistance experiments\nwere performed in a similar sample where electrical contacts were placed on the\nCo layer. In the region of the field - temperature diagram where flux\ninstabilities are known to occur in Nb films, irregular jumps are observed in\nthe magnetic hysteresis and large amplitude noise is detected in the\nmagneto-resistance and Hall resistivity data when measured as a function of the\nfield.\n", "  We evaluate the relative entropy on a ball region near the UV fixed point of\na holographic conformal field theory deformed by a fermionic operator of\nnonzero vacuum expectation value. The positivity of the relative entropy\nconsidered here is implied by the expected monotonicity of decrease of quantum\nentanglement under RG flow. The calculations are done in the perturbative\nframework of Einstein-Cartan gravity in four-dimensional asymptotic anti-de\nSitter space with a postulated standard bilinear coupling between axial fermion\ncurrent and torsion. By requiring positivity of relative entropy, our result\nyields a constraint on axial current-torsion coupling, fermion mass and\nequation of state.\n", "  We have generalized the Nanbu collision algorithm to accommodate arbitrary\ncollision rates, enabling accurate kinetic modeling of short range particle\ninteractions in non-Spitzer systems. With this extension, we explore the effect\nof different collision models on the simulation of how ultra-intense lasers\nfirst begin to heat a target. The effect of collisions on plasma evolution is\ncrucial for treating particle slowing, energy transport, and thermalization.\nThe widely used Nanbu collision algorithm provides a fast and computationally\nefficient method to include the effects of collisions between charged particles\nin kinetic simulations without requiring that the particles already be in local\nthermal equilibrium. However, it is \"hardwired\" to use Spitzer collision rates\nappropriate for hot, relatively dilute plasmas. This restriction prevents the\nNanbu collision algorithm from accurately describing the initial heating of a\ncold target, a key problem for the study of laser damage or the generation of\nthe warm dense matter state. We describe our approach for modifying the Nanbu\ncollision algorithm and demonstrate the improved accuracy for copper targets.\n", "  Various quantum-walk based algorithms have been proposed to analyse and rank\nthe centrality of graph vertices. However, issues arise when working with\ndirected graphs --- the resulting non-Hermitian Hamiltonian leads to\nnon-unitary dynamics, and the total probability of the quantum walker is no\nlonger conserved. In this paper, we discuss a method for simulating directed\ngraphs using PT-symmetric quantum walks, allowing probability conserving\nnon-unitary evolution. This method is equivalent to mapping the directed graph\nto an undirected, yet weighted, complete graph over the same vertex set, and\ncan be extended to cover interdependent networks of directed graphs. Previous\nwork has shown centrality measures based on the CTQW provide an\neigenvector-like quantum centrality; using the PT-symmetric framework, we\nextend these centrality algorithms to directed graphs with a significantly\nreduced Hilbert space compared to previous proposals. In certain cases, this\ncentrality measure provides an advantage over classical algorithms used in\nnetwork analysis, for example by breaking vertex rank degeneracy. Finally, we\nperform a statistical analysis over ensembles of random graphs, and show strong\nagreement with the classical PageRank measure on directed acyclic graphs.\n", "  The so-called \"dipper\" stars host circumstellar disks and have optical and\ninfrared light curves that exhibit quasi-periodic or aperiodic dimming events\nconsistent with extinction by transiting dusty structures orbiting in the inner\ndisk. Most of the proposed mechanisms explaining the dips---i.e., occulting\ndisk warps, vortices, and forming planetesimals---assume nearly edge-on viewing\ngeometries. However, our analysis of the three known dippers with publicly\navailable resolved sub-mm data reveals disks with a range of inclinations, most\nnotably the face-on transition disk J1604-2130 (EPIC 204638512). This suggests\nthat nearly edge-on viewing geometries are not a defining characteristic of the\ndippers and that additional models should be explored. If confirmed by further\nobservations of more dippers, this would point to inner disk processes that\nregularly produce dusty structures far above the outer disk midplane in regions\nrelevant to planet formation.\n", "  The critical phenomena of dilaton AdS black holes are probed from a totally\ndifferent perspective other than the $P-v$ criticality and the $q-U$\ncriticality discussed in the former literature. We investigate not only the two\npoint correlation function but also the entanglement entropy of dilaton AdS\nblack holes. We achieve this goal by solving the equation of motion constrained\nby the boundary condition numerically and we concentrate on $\\delta L$ and\n$\\delta S$ which have been regularized by subtracting the terms in pure AdS\nwith the same boundary region. For both the two point correlation function and\nthe entanglement entropy, we consider $4\\times2\\times2=16$ cases due to\ndifferent choices of parameters. The van der Waals like behavior can be clearly\nwitnessed from all the $T-\\delta L$ ($T-\\delta S$) graphs for $q<q_c$.\nMoreover, the effects of dilaton gravity and the spacetime dimensionality on\nthe phase structure of dilaton AdS black holes are disclosed. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss the stability of dilaton AdS black holes by applying the analogous\nspecific heat definition and remove the unstable branch by introducing a bar\n$T=T_*$. It is shown that the first order phase transition temperature $T_*$ is\naffected by both $\\alpha$ and $n$. The analogous equal area laws for both the\n$T-\\delta L$ graph and the $T-\\delta S$ graph are examined numerically. The\nrelative errors for all the cases are small enough that we can safely conclude\nthat the analogous equal area laws hold for $T-\\delta L$ ($T-\\delta S$) graph\nof dilaton AdS black holes.\n", "  We discuss the clusters of resources that emerge when upper-division students\nwrite about electromagnetic fields in linear materials. The data analyzed for\nthis paper comes from students' written tests in an upper-division electricity\nand magnetism course. We examine how these clusters change with time and\ncontext. The evidence shows that students benefit from activating resources\nrelated to the internal structure of the atom when thinking about electric\nfields and their effect on materials. We argue that facilitating activation of\ncertain resources by the instructor in the classroom can affect the plasticity\nof those resources in the student, making them more solid and easily activated.\nWe find that the wording of the questions posed to students affects which\nresources are activated, and that students often fill in resources to link\nknown phenomena to phenomena described by the question when lacking detailed\nmental models.\n", "  A systematic study on the different roles of the governing components of a\nwell-defined finite-deformation gradient crystal-plasticity model proposed by\n(Gurtin, 2008b) is carried out, in order to visualize the capability of the\nmodel in the prediction of a wide range of hardening behaviors as well as\nrate-dependent, scale-variation and Bauschinger-like responses in a single\ncrystal. A function of accumulation rates of dislocations is employed and\nviewed as a measure of formation of short-range interactions which impede\ndislocation movements within a crystal. The model is first represented in the\nreference configuration for the purpose of numerical implementation, and then\nimplemented in the FEM software ABAQUS via a user-defined subroutine (UEL). Our\nsimulation results reveal that the dissipative gradient-strengthening is also\nidentified as a source of isotropic-hardening behavior, which represents the\neffect of cold work introduced by (Gurtin and Ohno, 2011). Moreover, plastic\nflows in predefined slip systems and expansion of accumulation of GNDs are\ndistinctly observed in varying scales and under different loading conditions.\n", "  We successfully demonstrate a quantum gas microscopy using the Faraday effect\nwhich has an inherently non-destructive nature. The observed Faraday rotation\nangle reaches 3.0(2) degrees for a single atom. We reveal the non-destructive\nfeature of this Faraday imaging method by comparing the detuning dependence of\nthe Faraday signal strength with that of the photon scattering rate. We\ndetermine the atom distribution with deconvolution analysis. We also\ndemonstrate the absorption and the dark field Faraday imaging, and reveal the\ndifferent shapes of the point spread functions for these methods, which are\nfully explained by theoretical analysis. Our result is an important first step\ntowards an ultimate quantum non-demolition site-resolved imaging and\nfurthermore opens up the possibilities for quantum feedback control of a\nquantum many-body system with a single-site resolution.\n", "  We present a linear system of difference equations whose entries are\nexpressed in terms of theta functions. This linear system is singular at\n$4m+12$ points for $m \\geq 1$, which appear in pairs due to a symmetry\ncondition. We parameterize this linear system in terms a set of kernels at the\nsingular points. We regard the system of discrete isomonodromic deformations as\nan elliptic analogue of the Garnier system. We identify the special case in\nwhich $m=1$ with the elliptic Painlev\\'e equation, hence, this work provides an\nexplicit form and Lax pair for the elliptic Painlev\\'e equation.\n", "  A proposal for the generation of singlet states of three $\\Lambda$-type\nRydberg atoms is presented. The singlet state is prepared through the\ncombination of a Rydberg state and an EPR pair, and the scheme relies on the\nRydberg blockade effect which prevents the simultaneous excitation of the two\natoms to a Rydberg state. In addition, some frequency detuning between lasers\nand atomic transitions is set to eliminate the degenerate of the two ground\nstates. And finally, a series of numerical simulations are made to show the\nfeasibility of the scheme.\n", "  The effects of contact-line pinning are well-known in macroscopic systems,\nbut are only just beginning to be explored at the microscale in colloidal\nsuspensions. We use digital holography to capture the fast three-dimensional\ndynamics of micrometer-sized ellipsoids breaching an oil-water interface. We\nfind that the particle angle varies approximately linearly with the height, in\ncontrast to results from simulations based on minimization of the interfacial\nenergy. Using a simple model of the motion of the contact line, we show that\nthe observed coupling between translational and rotational degrees of freedom\nis likely due to contact-line pinning. We conclude that the dynamics of\ncolloidal particles adsorbing to a liquid interface are not determined by\nminimization of interfacial energy and viscous dissipation alone; contact-line\npinning dictates both the timescale and pathway to equilibrium.\n", "  We present families of single determinantal representations of on-shell\nscalar products of Bethe vectors. Our families of representations are\nparameterized by a continuous complex variable which can be fixed at\nconvenience. Here we consider Bethe vectors in two versions of the six-vertex\nmodel: the case with boundary twists and the case with open boundaries.\n", "  We consider the minimization of theta functions\n$\\theta\\_\\Lambda(\\alpha)=\\sum\\_{p\\in\\Lambda}e^{-\\pi\\alpha|p|^2}$ amongst\nlattices $\\Lambda\\subset \\mathbb R^d$, by reducing the dimension of the\nproblem, following as a motivation the case $d=3$, where minimizers are\nsupposed to be either the BCC or the FCC lattices. A first way to reduce\ndimension is by considering layered lattices, and minimize either among\ncompetitors presenting different sequences of repetitions of the layers, or\namong competitors presenting different shifts of the layers with respect to\neach other. The second case presents the problem of minimizing theta functions\nalso on translated lattices, namely minimizing $(L,u)\\mapsto\n\\theta\\_{L+u}(\\alpha)$. Another way to reduce dimension is by considering\nlattices with a product structure or by successively minimizing over concentric\nlayers. The first direction leads to the question of minimization amongst\northorhombic lattices, whereas the second is relevant for asymptotics\nquestions, which we study in detail in two dimensions.\n", "  We show that the Hilbert space formed from a block spin renormalization\nconstruction of a cyclic quantum spin chain (based on the Temperley-Lieb\nalgebra) does not support a chiral conformal field theory whose Hamiltonian\ngenerates translation on the circle as a continuous limit of the rotations on\nthe lattice.\n", "  We investigate experimentally and numerically the defect configurations\nemerging when a cholesteric liquid crystal is confined to a spherical shell. We\nuncover a rich scenario of defect configurations, some of them non-existent in\nnematic shells, where new types of defects are stabilized by the helical\nordering of the liquid crystal. In contrast to nematic shells, here defects are\nnot simple singular points or lines, but have a large structured core.\nSpecifically, we observe five different types of cholesteric shells. We study\nthe statistical distribution of the different types of shells as a function of\nthe two relevant geometrical dimensionless parameters of the system. By playing\nwith these parameters, we are able to induce transitions between different\ntypes of shells. These transitions involve interesting topological\ntransformations in which the defects recombine to form new structures.\nSurprisingly, the defects do not approach each other by taking the shorter\ndistance route (geodesic), but by following intricate paths.\n", "  Rooted in group field theory and matrix models, random tensor models are a\nrecent background-invariant approach to quantum gravity in arbitrary\ndimensions. Colored tensor models (CTM) generate random triangulated orientable\n(pseudo)-manifolds. We analyze, in low dimensions, which known spaces are\ntriangulated by specific CTM interactions. As a tool, we develop the\ngraph-encoded surgery that is compatible with the structure of quantum field\ntheory and use it to prove that a single model, the complex\n$\\varphi^4$-interaction in rank-$2$, generates all orientable $2$-bordisms,\nthus, in particular, also all orientable, closed surfaces. We show that certain\nquartic rank-$3$ CTM, the $\\varphi_3^4$-theory, has as boundary sector all\nclosed, possibly disconnected, orientable surfaces. Hence all closed orientable\nsurfaces are cobordant via manifolds generated by the $\\varphi_3^4$-theory.\n", "  Development of algorithms and growth of computational resources in the past\ndecades have enabled simulations of sediment transport processes with\nunprecedented fidelities. The Computational Fluid Dynamics--Discrete Element\nMethod (CFD--DEM) is one of the high-fidelity approaches, where the motions of\nand collisions among the sediment grains as well as their interactions with\nsurrounding fluids are resolved. In most DEM solvers the particles are modeled\nas soft spheres due to computational efficiency and implementation complexity\nconsiderations, although natural sediments are usually mixture of non-spherical\nparticles. Previous attempts to extend sphere-based DEM to treat irregular\nparticles neglected fluid-induced torques on particles, and the method lacked\nflexibility to handle sediments with an arbitrary mixture of particle shapes.\nIn this contribution we proposed a simple, efficient approach to represent\ncommon sediment grain shapes with bonded spheres, where the fluid forces are\ncomputed and applied on each sphere. The proposed approach overcomes the\naforementioned limitations of existing methods and has improved efficiency and\nflexibility over existing approaches. We use numerical simulations to\ndemonstrate the merits and capability of the proposed method in predicting the\nfalling characteristics, terminal velocity, threshold of incipient motion, and\ntransport rate of natural sediments. The simulations show that the proposed\nmethod is a promising approach for faithful representation of natural sediment,\nwhich leads to accurate simulations of their transport dynamics. The proposed\nmethod also opens the possibility for first-principle-based simulations of the\nflocculation and sedimentation dynamics of cohesive sediments. Elucidation of\nthese physical mechanisms can provide much needed improvement on the prediction\ncapability and physical understanding of muddy coast dynamics.\n", "  In the present paper, we construct QMCs associated with Open Quantum Random\nWalks such that the transition operator of the chain is defined by OQRW and the\nrestriction of QMC to the commutative subalgebra coincides with the\ndistribution $P_\\rho$ of OQRW. This sheds new light on some properties of the\nmeasure $P_\\rho$. As an example, we simply mention that the measure can be\nconsidered as a distribution of some functions of certain Markov process.\nFurthermore, we study several properties of QMC and associated measure. A new\nnotion of $\\f$-recurrence of QMC is studied, and it is established relations\nbetween the defined recurrence and the existing ones.\n", "  We propose a general theory for the analytical description of versatile\nhysteretic phenomena in a graphene field effect transistor (GFET) allowing for\nthe existence of the external dipoles on graphene free surface and the\nlocalized states at the graphene-surface interface. We demonstrated that the\nabsorbed dipole molecules (e.g. dissociated or highly polarized water\nmolecules) can cause hysteretic form of carrier concentration as a function of\ngate voltage and corresponding dependence of graphene conductivity in GFET on\nthe substrate of different types, including the most common SiO2 and\nferroelectric ones. It was shown that the increase of the gate voltage sweeping\nrate leads to the complete vanishing of hysteresis for GFET on SiO2 substrate,\nas well as for GFET on ferroelectric substrate for applied electric fields E\nless than the critical value Ec. For E>Ec the crossover from the hysteresis to\nantihysteresis takes place. These results well correlate with the available\nexperimental data up to the quantitative agreement. Proposed model takes into\nconsideration the carriers trapping from the graphene channel by the interface\nstates and describes the antihysteresis in GFET on PZT substrate well enough.\nObtained results clarify the fundamental principles of GFET operation as well\nas can be directly applied to describe the basic characteristics of advanced\nnonvolatile ultra-fast memory devices using GFET on versatile substrates.\n", "  Ultrathin sheets of MoS2 are a newly discovered 2D semiconductor that holds\ngreat promise for nanoelectronics. Understanding the pattern of current flow\nwill be crucial for developing devices. In this talk, we present images of\ncurrent flow in MoS2 obtained with a Scanned Probe Microscope (SPM) cooled to 4\nK. We previously used this technique to image electron trajectories in\nGaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures and graphene. The charged SPM tip is held just\nabove the sample surface, creating an image charge inside the device that\nscatters electrons. By measuring the change in resistance {\\Delta}R while the\ntip is raster scanned above the sample, an image of electron flow is obtained.\nWe present images of electron flow in an MoS2 device patterned into a hall bar\ngeometry. A three-layer MoS2 sheet is encased by two hBN layers, top and\nbottom, and patterned into a hall-bar with multilayer graphene contacts. An SPM\nimage shows the current flow pattern from the wide contact at the end of the\ndevice for a Hall density n = 1.3x10^12 cm^-2. The SPM tip tends to block flow,\nincreasing the resistance R. The pattern of flow was also imaged for a narrow\nside contact on the sample. At density n = 5.4x10^11 cm^-2; the pattern seen in\nthe SPM image is similar to the wide contact. The ability to image electron\nflow promises to be very useful for the development of ultrathin devices from\nnew 2D materials.\n", "  In this work the exact Friedmann-Robertson-Walker equations for an Elko\nspinor field coupled to gravity in an Einstein-Cartan framework are presented.\nThe torsion functions coupling the Elko field spin-connection to gravity can be\nexactly solved and the FRW equations for the system assume a relatively simple\nform. In the limit of a slowly varying Elko spinor field there is a relevant\ncontribution to the field equations acting exactly as a time varying\ncosmological model $\\Lambda(t)=\\Lambda_*+3\\beta H^2$, where $\\Lambda_*$ and\n$\\beta$ are constants. Observational data using distance luminosity from\nmagnitudes of supernovae constraint the parameters $\\Omega_m$ and $\\beta$,\nwhich leads to a lower limit to the Elko mass. Such model mimics, then, the\neffects of a dark energy fluid, here sourced by the Elko spinor field. The\ndensity perturbations in the linear regime were also studied in the\npseudo-Newtonian formalism.\n", "  In this paper we propose the application of a new model of transients of pore\npressure p and solute density \\r{ho} in geologic porous media. This model is\nrooted in the non-linear waves theory, the focus of which is advection and\neffect of large pressure jumps on strain (due to large p in a non-linear\nversion of the Hooke law). It strictly relates p and \\r{ho} evolving under the\neffect of a strong external stress. As a result, the presence of quick and\nsharp transients in low permeability rocks is unveiled, i.e. the non-linear\nBurgers solitons. We therefore propose that the actual transport process in\nporous rocks for large signals is not the linear diffusion, but could be\ngoverned by solitons. A test of an eventual presence of solitons in a rock is\nhere proposed, and then applied to Pierre Shale, Bearpaw Shale, Boom Clay and\nOznam-Mugu silt and clay. A quick analysis showing the presence of solitons for\nnuclear waste disposal and salty water intrusions is also analyzed. Finally, in\na kind of \"theoretical experiment\" we show that solitons could also be present\nin Jordan and St. Peter sandstones, thus suggesting the occurrence of osmosis\nin these rocks.\n", "  The heat capacity of conduction electrons obtained from the Sommerfeld\nexpansion is shown to be tunable via the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit\ncoupling parameters. Using an AlInSb/InSb/AlInSb as a representative\nheterostructure with alterable well and asymmetric barrier regions, the heat\ncapacity is found to be higher for the spin-down electrons and suffers a\nreduction for wider wells. A further lowering is obtained through the\napplication of an uniaxial strain. Finally, we suggest a method to determine\nthe spin lifetimes for spins relaxing via the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism from\nexperimental estimates of thermodynamic potentials such as the Helmholtz free\nenergy and the heat capacity.\n", "  Valuable dynamical and structural information about neat liquid DMSO at\nambient conditions can be obtained through study of low frequency vibrations in\nthe far infrared (FIR), that is, terahertz regime. For DMSO, collective\nexcitations as well as single molecule stretches and bends have been measured\nby different kinds of experiments such as OHD-RIKES and terahertz spectroscopy.\nIn the present work we investigate the intermolecular vibrational spectrum of\nDMSO through three different computational techniques namely (i) the far-infra\nred spectrum obtained through Fourier transform of total dipole moment auto\ntime correlation function, (ii) from Fourier transform of the translational and\nangular velocity time autocorrelation functions and a (iii) quenched normal\nmode analysis of the parent liquid at 300K. The three spectrum, although\nexhibit differences among each other, reveal similar features which are in\ngood, semi-quantitative, agreement with experimental results. Study of\nparticipation ratio of the density of states obtained from normal mode analysis\nshows that the broad spectrum around 100 cm-1 involves collective oscillations\nof 300-400 molecules. Dipolar solvation dynamics exhibit ultrafast energy\nrelaxation (dipolar solvation dynamics) with initial time correlation function\naround 140 fs which can be attributed to the coupling to the collective\nexcitations. We compare properties of DMSO with those of water vis-a-vis the\nexistence of the low frequency collective modes. Lastly, we find that the\ncollective excitation spectrum exhibits strong temperature dependence.\n", "  Ex vacuo atom chips, used in conjunction with a custom thin walled vacuum\nchamber, have enabled the rapid replacement of atom chips for magnetically\ntrapped cold atom experiments. Atoms were trapped in $>2$ kHz magnetic traps\ncreated using high power atom chips. The thin walled vacuum chamber allowed the\natoms to be trapped $\\lesssim1$ mm from the atom chip conductors which were\nlocated outside of the vacuum system. Placing the atom chip outside of the\nvacuum simplified the electrical connections and improved thermal management.\nUsing a multi-lead Z-wire chip design, a Bose-Einstein condensate was produced\nwith an external atom chip. Vacuum and optical conditions were maintained while\nreplacing the Z-wire chip with a newly designed cross-wire chip. The atom chips\nwere exchanged and an initial magnetic trap was achieved in less than three\nhours.\n", "  The electrocaloric effect (ECE) of BaZr$_{x}$Ti$_{1-x}$O$_3$ (BZT) is closely\nrelated to the relaxor state transition of the materials. This work presents a\nsystematic study on the ECE and the state transition of the BZT, using a\ncombined canonical and microcanonical Monte Carlo simulations based a\nlattice-based on a Ginzburg-Landau-type Hamiltonian. For comparison and\nverification, experimental measurements have been carried on BTO and BZT\n($x=0.12$ and $0.2$) samples, including the ECE at various temperatures, domain\npatterns by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy at room temperature, and the P-E\nloops at various temperatures. Results show that the dependency of BZT behavior\nof the Zr-concentration can be classified into three different stages. In the\ncomposition range of $ 0 \\leq x \\leq 0.2 $, ferroelectric domains are visible,\nbut ECE peak drops with increasing Zr-concentration harshly. In the range of $\n0.3 \\leq x \\leq 0.7 $, relaxor features become prominent, and the decrease of\nECE with Zr-concentration is moderate. In the high concentration range of $ x\n\\geq 0.8 $, the material is almost nonpolar, and there is no ECE peak visible.\nResults suggest that BZT with certain low range of Zr-concentration around\n$x=0.12 \\sim 0.3 $ can be a good candidate with relatively high ECE and\nsimutaneously wide temperature application range at rather low temperature.\n", "  The formation of colloidal gels is strongly dependent on the volume fraction\nof the system and the strength of the interactions between the colloids. Here\nwe explore very dilute solutions by the means of numerical simulations, and\nshow that, in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions and for sufficiently\nstrong interactions, percolating colloidal gels can be realised at very low\nvalues of the volume fraction. Characterising the structure of the network of\nthe arrested material we find that, when reducing the volume fraction, the gels\nare dominated by low-energy local structures, analogous to the isolated\nclusters of the interaction potential. Changing the strength of the interaction\nallows us to tune the compactness of the gel as characterised by the fractal\ndimension, with low interaction strength favouring more chain-like structures.\n", "  In this work, the transport of tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) based on\nvertically stacked hereto-structures from 2D transition metal dichalcogenide\n(TMD) materials is investigated by atomistic quantum transport simulations.\nWTe2-MoS2 combination was chosen due to the formation of a broken gap\nhetero-junction which is desirable for TFETs. There are two assumptions behind\nthe MoS2-WTe2 hetero-junction tight binding (TB) model: 1) lattice registry. 2)\nThe $S-Te$ parameters being the average of the $S-S$ and $Te-Te$ parameters of\nbilayer MoS2 and WTe2. The computed TB bandstructure of the hetero-junction\nagrees well with the bandstructure obtained from density functional theory\n(DFT) in the energy range of interest for transport. NEGF (Non-Equilibrium\nGreen$'$s Function) equations within the tight binding description is then\nutilized for device transfer characteristic calculation. Results show 1) energy\nfiltering is the switching mechanism; 2) the length of the extension region is\ncritical for device to turn off; 3) MoS2-WTe2 interlayer TFET can achieve a\nlarge on-current of $1000 \\mu A/\\mu m$ with $V_{DD} = 0.3V$, which suggests\ninterlayer TFET can solve the low ON current problem of TFETs and can be a\npromising candidate for low power applications.\n", "  We propose a classification of the reflection $K$-matrices (solutions of the\nboundary Yang-Baxter equation) for the\n$U_{q}[\\mathrm{osp}^{\\left(2\\right)}\\left(2|2m\\right)]=U_{q}[C^{\\left(2\\right)}\\left(m+1\\right)]$\nvertex-model. We have found four families of solutions, namely, the complete\nsolutions, in which no elements of the reflection $K$-matrix is null, the\nblock-diagonal solutions, the $X$-shape solutions and the diagonal solutions.\nWe highlight that these diagonal $K$-matrices also hold for the\n$U_{q}[\\mathrm{osp}^{\\left(2\\right)}\\left(2n+2|2m\\right)]=U_{q}[D^{\\left(2\\right)}\\left(n+1,m\\right)]$\nvertex-model.\n", "  In this paper, we extend a method recently reported [Phys. Rev. E 87, 042921\n(2012)] for the calculation of the eigestates of classically highly chaotic\nsystems to cases of mixed dynamics, i.e. those presenting regular and irregular\nmotions at the same energy. The efficiency of the method, which is based on the\nuse of a semiclassical basis set of localized wave functions, is demonstrated\nby applying it to the determination of the vibrational states of a realistic\nmolecular system, namely the LiCN molecule.\n", "  Experimental studies of spin transport in a two-dimensional electron gas\nhosted by a triple GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well are reported. Using time-resolved\nKerr rotation, we observed the precession of the spin polarization about a\ncurrent-controlled spin-orbit magnetic field. Spatially-resolved imaging showed\na large variation of the electron g-factor and the drift transport of coherent\nelectron spins over distances exceeding half-millimetre in a direction\ntransverse to the electric field.\n", "  Light induced processes in nature occur by irradiation with slowly turned-on\nincoherent light. The general case of time-dependent incoherent excitation is\nsolved here analytically for V-type systems using a newly developed master\nequation method. Clear evidence emerges for the disappearance of radiatively\ninduced coherence as turn-on times of the radiation exceed characteristic\nsystem times. The latter is the case, in nature, for all relevant dynamical\ntime scales for other than nearly degenerate energy levels. We estimate that,\nin the absence of non-radiative relaxation and decoherence, turn-on times\nslower than 1 ms (still short by natural standards) induce Fano coherences\nbetween energy eigenstates that are separated by less than 0.9 cm$^{-1}$.\n", "  We show how the success of deep learning could depend not only on mathematics\nbut also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that\nneural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of\nfunctions of practical interest can frequently be approximated through \"cheap\nlearning\" with exponentially fewer parameters than generic ones. We explore how\nproperties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality,\ncompositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally\nsimple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process\ngenerating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and\nmachine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow\none. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the\nrelation to the renormalization group. We prove various \"no-flattening\ntheorems\" showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately\napproximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss, for example, we show that\n$n$ variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2^n neurons in a single\nhidden layer.\n", "  We study patterns of quantum entanglement in systems of spins and ghost-spins\nregarding them as simple quantum mechanical toy models for theories containing\nnegative norm states. We define a single ghost-spin as in arXiv:1602.06505\n[hep-th] as a 2-state spin variable with an indefinite inner product in the\nstate space. We find that whenever the spin sector is disentangled from the\nghost-spin sector (both of which could be entangled within themselves), the\nreduced density matrix obtained by tracing over all the ghost-spins gives rise\nto positive entanglement entropy for positive norm states, while negative norm\nstates have an entanglement entropy with a negative real part and a constant\nimaginary part. However when the spins are entangled with the ghost-spins,\nthere are new entanglement patterns in general. For systems where the number of\nghost-spins is even, it is possible to find subsectors of the Hilbert space\nwhere positive norm states always lead to positive entanglement entropy after\ntracing over the ghost-spins. With an odd number of ghost-spins however, we\nfind that there always exist positive norm states with negative real part for\nentanglement entropy after tracing over the ghost-spins.\n", "  Understanding diffusion in liquids from properties of static structure is a\nlong standing problem in condensed matter theory. Here we report an atomistic\nstudy of excess entropy and diffusion coefficient in a strongly coupled Yukawa\nliquid. We observe that the pair excess entropy $s_2$ scales with temperature\nas $-3.285 \\;(T_m / T)^{0.665}$ and contributes to about $90\\%$ of the total\nexcess entropy close to the freezing transition $T_m$. We further report that\nat low temperatures where the diffusive transport is mediated by cage\nrelaxation, the diffusion coefficient when expressed in natural units of the\nEnskog collision frequency and the effective hard sphere diameter, obeys the\nscaling law $0.04\\; e^{s_2}$ and deviates from it at high enough temperatures\nwhere cages cannot form. The scaling laws reported here may also apply to\nstrongly coupled dusty plasmas and charged colloids.\n", "  In this paper, we present new analytical solutions of the Bohr Hamiltonian\nproblem that we derived with the Tietz-Hua potential, here used for describing\nthe {\\beta}-part of the nuclear collective potential plus harmonic oscillator\none for the {\\gamma}-part. Also, we proceed to a systematic comparison of the\nnumerical results obtained with this kind of {\\beta}-potential with others\nwhich are widely used in such a framework as well as with the experiment. The\ncalculations are carried out for energy spectra and electromagnetic transition\nprobabilities for {\\gamma}-unstable and axially symmetric deformed nuclei. In\nthe same frame, we show the effect of the shape flatness of the\n{\\beta}-potential beyond its minimum on transition rates calculations.\n", "  This paper gives a construction of certain asymptotic observables (Araki-Haag\ndetectors) in ground state representations of gapped quantum spin systems. The\nconstruction is based on general assumptions which are satisfied e.g. in the\nIsing model in strong transverse magnetic fields. We do not use the method of\npropagation estimates, but exploit instead compactness of the relevant\npropagation observables at any fixed time. Implications for the problem of\nasymptotic completeness are briefly discussed.\n", "  The Zoo solution to Fermi's Paradox proposes that extraterrestrial\nintelligences (ETIs) have agreed to not contact the Earth. The strength of this\nsolution depends on the ability for ETIs to come to agreement, and\nestablish/police treaties as part of a so-called \"Galactic Club\". These\nactivities are principally limited by the causal connectivity of a civilisation\nto its neighbours at its inception, i.e. whether it comes to prominence being\naware of other ETIs and any treaties or agreements in place.\n  If even one civilisation is not causally connected to the other members of a\ntreaty, then they are free to operate beyond it and contact the Earth if\nwished, which makes the Zoo solution \"soft\". We should therefore consider how\nlikely this scenario is, as this will give us a sense of the Zoo solution's\nsoftness, or general validity.\n  We implement a simple toy model of ETIs arising in a Galactic Habitable Zone,\nand calculate the properties of the groups of culturally connected\ncivilisations established therein. We show that for most choices of\ncivilisation parameters, the number of culturally connected groups is greater\nthan 1, meaning that the Galaxy is composed of multiple Galactic Cliques rather\nthan a single Galactic Club. We find in our models for a single Galactic Club\nto establish interstellar hegemony, the number of civilisations must be\nrelatively large, the mean civilisation lifetime must be several millions of\nyears, and the inter-arrival time between civilisations must be a few million\nyears or less.\n", "  We consider the possibility of using reweighting techniques in order to\ncorrect for the breaking of unitarity when twisted boundary conditions are\nimposed on valence fermions in simulations of lattice gauge theories. We start\nby studying the properties of reweighting factors and their variances at\ntree-level. That leads us to the introduction of a factorization for the\nfermionic reweighting determinant. In the numerical, stochastic, implementation\nof the method, we find that the effect of reweighting is negligible in the case\nof large volumes but it is sizeable when the volumes are small and the twisting\nangles are large. More importantly, we find that for un-improved Wilson\nfermions, and in small volumes, the dependence of the critical quark mass on\nthe twisting angle is quite pronounced and results in large violations of the\ncontinuum dispersion relation.\n", "  It is extremely uncommon to be able to predict the velocity profile of a\nturbulent flow. In two-dimensional flows, atmosphere dynamics, and plasma\nphysics, large scale coherent jets are created through inverse energy transfers\nfrom small scales to the largest scales of the flow. We prove that in the\nlimits of vanishing energy injection, vanishing friction, and small scale\nforcing, the velocity profile of a jet obeys an equation independent of the\ndetails of the forcing. We find another general relation for the maximal\ncurvature of a jet and we give strong arguments to support the existence of an\nhydrodynamic instability at the point with minimal jet velocity. Those results\nare the first computations of Reynolds stresses and self consistent velocity\nprofiles from the turbulent dynamics, and the first consistent analytic theory\nof zonal jets in barotropic turbulence.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of the mean-field polaron in the weak-coupling limit\nof vanishing electron-phonon interaction, $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. This is a\nsingular limit formally leading to a Schr\\\"odinger--Poisson system that is\nequivalent to the nonlinear Choquard equation. By establishing estimates\nbetween the approximation obtained via the Choquard equation and true solutions\nof the original system we show that the Choquard equation makes correct\npredictions about the dynamics of the polaron mean-field model for small values\nof $\\varepsilon > 0$.\n", "  We analyze the stability properties shown by KMS states for interacting\nmassive scalar fields propagating over Minkowski spacetime, recently\nconstructed in the framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theories\nby Fredenhagen and Lindner \\cite{FredenhagenLindner}. In particular, we prove\nthe validity of the return to equilibrium property when the interaction\nLagrangian has compact spatial support. Surprisingly, this does not hold\nanymore, if the adiabatic limit is considered, namely when the interaction\nLagrangian is invariant under spatial translations. Consequently, an\nequilibrium state under the adiabatic limit for a perturbative interacting\ntheory evolved with the free dynamics does not converge anymore to the free\nequilibrium state. Actually, we show that its ergodic mean converges to a non\nequilibrium steady state for the free theory.\n", "  We extend the localized operator partitioning method (LOPM) [J. Nagesh, A.F.\nIzmaylov, and P. Brumer, J. Chem. Phys. 142, 084114 (2015)] to the\ntime-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) framework to partition\nmolecular electronic energies of excited states in a rigorous manner. A\nmolecular fragment is defined as a collection of atoms using\nStratman-Scuseria-Frisch atomic partitioning. A numerically efficient scheme\nfor evaluating the fragment excitation energy is derived employing a resolution\nof the identity to preserve standard one- and two-electron integrals in the\nfinal expressions. The utility of this partitioning approach is demonstrated by\nexamining several excited states of two bichromophoric compounds:\n9-((1-naphthyl)-methyl)-anthracene and 4-((2-naphthyl)-methyl)-benzaldehyde.\nThe LOPM is found to provide nontrivial insights into the nature of electronic\nenergy localization that are not accessible using simple density difference\nanalysis.\n", "  We propose and evaluate the graphene layer (GL) infrared photodetectors\n(GLIPs) based on the van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with the radiation\nabsorbing GLs. The operation of the GLIPs is associated with the electron\nphotoexcitation from the GL valence band to the continuum states above the\ninter-GL barriers (either via tunneling or direct transitions to the continuum\nstates). Using the developed device model, we calculate the photodetector\ncharacteristics as functions of the GL-vdW heterostructure parameters. We show\nthat due to a relatively large efficiency of the electron photoexcitation and\nlow capture efficiency of the electrons propagating over the barriers in the\ninter-GL layers, GLIPs should exhibit the elevated photoelectric gain and\ndetector responsivity as well as relatively high detectivity. The possibility\nof high-speed operation, high conductivity, transparency of the GLIP contact\nlayers, and the sensitivity to normally incident IR radiation provides\nadditional potential advantages in comparison with other IR photodetectors. In\nparticular, the proposed GLIPs can compete with unitravelling-carrier\nphotodetectors.\n", "  We extend the Coleman's antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) to develop a wave\nfunction theory that can incorporate up to four-body correlation in a region of\nstrong correlation. To facilitate the variational determination of the wave\nfunction, the total energy is rewritten in terms of the traces of geminals.\nThis novel trace formula is applied to a simple model system consisting of one\ndimensional Hubbard ring with a site of strong correlation. Our scheme\nsignificantly improves the result obtained by the AGP-CI scheme of Uemura et\nal. and also achieves more efficient compression of the degrees of freedom of\nthe wave function. We regard the result as a step toward a first-principles\nwave function theory for a strongly correlated point defect or adsorbate\nembedded in an AGP-based mean-field medium.\n", "  The D-CTC condition is a condition originally proposed by David Deutsch as a\ncondition on states of a quantum communication network that contains \"backward\ntime-steps\" in some of its branches. It has been argued that this is an\nanalogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves\n(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that\nfulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent\nliterature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework\nof quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag\nand Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states\nwhich are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for\na certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a\nquantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across\nacausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then\nthe D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary\nprecision. As this result pertains to quantum field theory on globally\nhyperbolic spacetimes where CTCs are absent, one may conclude that interpreting\nthe D-CTC condition as characteristic for quantum processes in the presence of\nCTCs could be misleading, and should be regarded with caution. Furthermore, a\nconstruction of the quantized massless Klein-Gordon field on the Politzer\nspacetime, often viewed as spacetime analogue for quantum communication\nnetworks with backward time-steps, is proposed in this work.\n", "  It is well-known that a (point-localized) free quantum field for massive\nparticles with spin $s$ acting in a Hilbert space has at best scaling dimension\n$s+1$, which excludes its use in the perturbative construction of\nrenormalizable interacting models for higher spin ($s\\geq 1$). Up to date, such\nmodels have been constructed only in the context of gauge theory, at the cost\nof introducing additional unphysical (ghost) fields and an unphysical\n(indefinite metric) state space. The unphysical degrees of freedom are divided\nout by requiring gauge (or BRST) invariance.\n  We construct free quantum fields for higher spin particles which have the\nsame good UV behaviour as the scalar field (scaling dimension one), and at the\nsame time act on a Hilbert space without ghosts. They are localized on\nsemi-infinite strings extending to space-like infinity, but are linearly\nrelated to their point-local counterparts. We argue that this is sufficient\nlocality for a perturbative construction of interacting models of the gauge\ntheory type, with a string-independent S-matrix and point-localized interacting\nobservable fields. The usual principle of gauge-invariance is here replaced by\nthe (deeper) principle of locality.\n", "  We investigate the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of an ecological network\nwith species dispersal mediated via a mean-field coupling. The local dynamics\nof the network are governed by the Truscott--Brindley model, which is an\nimportant ecological model showing excitability. Our results focus on the\ninterplay of excitability and dispersal by always considering that the\nindividual nodes are in their (excitable) steady states. In contrast to the\nprevious studies, we not only observe the dispersal induced generation of\noscillation but we also report two distinct mechanisms of cessation of\noscillations, namely amplitude and oscillation death. We show that, the\ndispersal between the nodes influences the intrinsic dynamics of the system\nresulting multiple oscillatory dynamics such as period-1 and period-2 limit\ncycles. We also show the existence of multi-cluster states which has much\nrelevance and importance in ecology.\n", "  Topological insulator (TI) thin films differ from the more commonly studied\nsemi-infinite bulk TIs in that the former possesses both top and bottom\nsurfaces where the surface states localized at different surfaces can couple to\none another due to the finite thickness of the film. In the presence of an\nin-plane mangnetization TI thin films display two distinct phases depending on\nwhich of the inter-surface coupling or the magnetization is stronger. In this\nwork, we consider a TI thin film system with an in-plane magnetization and\ncalculate numerically the resulting spin accumulation on both surfaces of the\nfilm due to an in-plane electric field to linear order. We describe a numerical\nscheme for performing the Kubo calculation calculation in which we include\nimpurity scattering and vertex corrections. We find that the sums of the spin\naccumulation over the two surfaces in the in-plane direction perpendicular to\nthe magnetization, and in the out of plane direction, are antisymmetric in\nFermi energy about the charge neutrality point and are non-vanishing only when\nthe symmetry between the top and bottom TI surfaces is broken. The impurity\nscattering, in general, diminishes the magnitude of the spin accumulation and\ncan also change the sign of the spin accumulation at some Fermi energies where\nthe accumulation is small.\n", "  When a gain system is coupled to a loss system, the energy usually flows from\nthe gain system to the loss one. We here present a counterintuitive theory for\nthe ground-state cooling of the mechanical resonator in optomechanical system\nvia a gain cavity. The energy flows first from the mechanical resonator into\nthe loss cavity, then into the gain cavity, and finally localizes there. The\nenergy localization in the gain cavity dramatically enhances the cooling rate\nof the mechanical resonator. Moreover, we show that unconventional optical\nspring effect, e.g., giant frequency shift and optically induced damping of the\nmechanical resonator, can be realized. Those feature a pre-cooling free\nground-state cooling, i.e., the mechanical resonator in thermal excitation at\nroom temperature can directly be cooled to its ground state. This cooling\napproach has the potential application for fundamental tests of quantum physics\nwithout complicated cryogenic setups.\n", "  We theoretically derive the lower and upper bounds of quantum Fisher\ninformation (QFI) of an SU(1,1) interferometer whatever the input state chosen.\nAccording to the QFI, the crucial resource for quantum enhancement is shown to\nbe large intramode correlations indicated by the Mandel $Q$-parameter. For a\nphoton-subtracted squeezed vacuum state with high super-Poissonian statistics\nin one input port and a coherent state in the other input port, the quantum\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao bound of the SU(1,1) interferometer can beat\n$1/\\langle\\hat{N}\\rangle$ scaling in presence of large fluctuations in the\nnumber of photons, with a given fixed input mean number of photons. The\ndefinition of the Heisenberg limit (HL) should take into account the amount of\nfluctuations. The HL considering the number fluctuation effect may be the\nultimate phase limit.\n", "  We investigate the out-of-equilibrium stationary states of spin-Hall devices\non the basis of the least dissipation principle. We show that, for a bulk\nparamagnet with spin-orbit interaction, in the case of the Hall bar geometry\nthe principle of minimum dissipated power prevents the generation of transverse\nspin and charge currents while in the case of the Corbino disk geometry,\ntransverse currents can be produced. More generally, we show that electric\ncharge accumulation prevents the stationary spin to charge current conversion.\n", "  Second-order conformal quantum superintegrable systems in 2 dimensions are\nLaplace equations on a manifold with an added scalar potential and $3$\nindependent 2nd order conformal symmetry operators. They encode all the\ninformation about 2D Helmholtz or time-independent Schr\\\"odinger\nsuperintegrable systems in an efficient manner: Each of these systems admits a\nquadratic symmetry algebra (not usually a Lie algebra) and is multiseparable.\nWe study the separation equations for the systems as a family rather than\nseparate cases. We show that the separation equations comprise all of the\nvarious types of hypergeometric and Heun equations in full generality. In\nparticular, they yield all of the 1D Schr\\\"odinger exactly solvable (ES) and\nquasi-exactly solvable (QES) systems related to the Heun operator. We focus on\ncomplex constant curvature spaces and show explicitly that there are 8 pairs of\nLaplace separation types and these types account for all separable coordinates\non the 20 flat space and 9 2-sphere Helmholtz superintegrable systems,\nincluding those for the constant potential case. The different systems are\nrelated by St\\\"ackel transforms, by the symmetry algebras and by B\\\"ocher\ncontractions of the conformal algebra so(4,C) to itself, which enables all\nsystems to be derived from a single one: the generic potential on the complex\n2-sphere. This approach facilitates a unified view of special function theory,\nincorporating hypergeometric and Heun functions in full generality.\n", "  In this work, we extend our previous esophageal transport model using an\nimmersed boundary (IB) method with discrete fiber-based structures, to one\nusing a continuum mechanics-based model that is approximated based on finite\nelements (IB-FE). To deal with the leakage of flow when the Lagrangian mesh\nbecomes coarser than the fluid mesh, we employ adaptive interaction quadrature\npoints for Lagrangian-Eulerian interaction equations based on a previous work.\nIn particular, we introduce a new anisotropic adaptive interaction quadrature\nrule. The new rule permits us to vary the interaction quadrature points not\nonly at each time-step and element but also at different orientations per\nelement. For the material model, we extend our previous fiber-based model to a\ncontinuum-based model. We first study a case in which a three-dimensional short\ntube is dilated. Results match very well with those from the implicit FE\nmethod. We remark that in our IB-FE case, the three-dimensional tube undergoes\na very large deformation and the Lagrangian mesh-size becomes about 6 times of\nEulerian mesh-size. To validate the method in handling fiber-matrix material\nmodels, we perform a second study on dilating a long fiber-reinforced tube.\nErrors are small when we compare numerical solutions with analytical solutions.\nThe technique is then applied to the problem of esophageal transport. We\npresent three cases that differ in the material model and muscle fiber\narchitecture. The overall transport features are consistent with those from the\nprevious model. We remark that the continuum-based model can handle more\nrealistic and complicated material behavior. This is demonstrated in our third\ncase with spatially varying fiber architecture. We find this unique muscle\nfiber architecture could generate a so-called pressure transition zone. This\nsuggests an important role of muscle fiber architecture in esophageal\ntransport.\n", "  The prospective Higgs factories, exemplified by ILC, FCC-ee and CEPC, plan to\nconduct the precision Higgs measurements at the $e^+e^-$ center-of-mass energy\naround 250 GeV. The cross sections for the dominant Higgs production channel,\nthe Higgsstrahlung process, can be measured to a (sub-) percent accuracy.\nMerely incorporating the well-known next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak\ncorrections appears far from sufficient to match the unprecedented experimental\nprecision. In this work, we make an important advancement toward this direction\nby investigating the mixed electroweak-QCD corrections to $e^+e^-\\to HZ$ at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) for both unpolarized and polarized $Z$\nboson. The corrections turn out to reach one percent level of the Born-order\nresults, thereby must be incorporated in the future confrontation with the\ndata.\n", "  We demonstrate a simple method by which time-dependent interactions can be\nexploited to improve self-assembly in colloidal systems. We apply this method\nto two systems: a model colloid with short-ranged attractive potentials that\nundergoes crystallisation, and a schematic model of cluster growth. The method\nis based on initially strong bonds between particles, to accelerate nucleation,\nfollowed by a stage with weaker bonds, to promote growth of high-quality\nassembled structures. We track the growth of clusters during assembly, which\nreveals insight into effects of multiple nucleation events, and of competition\nbetween the growth of clusters with different properties.\n", "  The number of nonrelativistic axions can be changed by inelastic reactions\nthat produce photons or relativistic axions. Any odd number of axions can\nannihilate into two photons. Any even number of nonrelativistic axions can\nscatter into two relativistic axions. We calculate the rate at which axions are\nlost from axion stars from these inelastic reactions. In dilute systems of\naxions, the dominant inelastic reaction is axion decay into two photons. In\nsufficiently dense systems of axions, the dominant inelastic reaction is the\nscattering of four nonrelativistic axions into two relativistic axions. The\nscattering of odd numbers of axions into two photons produces monochromatic\nradio-frequency signals at odd-integer harmonics of the fundamental frequency\nset by the axion mass. This provides a unique signature for dense systems of\naxions, such as a dense axion star or a collapsing dilute axion star.\n", "  Prior experimental studies showed that nanowires are promising structures for\nimproving the thermoelectric performance of practical thermoelectric materials\ndue to the strongly induced phonon-boundary scattering. However, few studies\nexamined the impact of phonon-boundary scattering on the thermal conductivity\nof thermoelectric nanowires from a first-principle approach. In this work, we\nsystematically study the role of phonon-boundary scattering with different\nboundary specularities on the thermal conductivity of PbSe nanowires by\nrigorously solving the full phonon Boltzmann transport equation without any\nadjustable parameters. We observe significant thermal conductivity reduction\nfor rough PbSe nanowires with diameters less than a few hundred nanometers. The\nreduction reaches ~ 40% for 10 nm thick rough PbSe nanowires at room\ntemperature. The diameter-dependent thermal conductivities are found to contain\nimportant information about the phonon mean free path distribution from a\nstandard reconstruction algorithm. The simulation results are important for\nfundamental understanding of nanoscale thermal transport in thermoelectric\nmaterials and will guide future design of thermoelectric devices to achieve\nbetter energy conversion efficiency.\n", "  The optomechanical force sensor in non-Markovian environment for a mechanical\noscillator is presented. By performing homodyne detection we obtain an\ngenerally expression for the output signal. It is shown that the weak force\ndetection is sensitive to the non-Markovian environment. The additional noise\ncan be obviously reduced comparing to the Markovian condition. Moreover, the\noptimal additional noise can be maintained in a rather low level without using\nassistant system or squeezing under available experimental condition in\nunsolved sideband regime. Our results provides a promising platform for\nreducing the additional noise by using engineered non-Markovian reservoir in\nultrasensitive detection.\n", "  In this paper, the Lorentz covariance of algorithms is introduced. Under\nLorentz transformation, both the form and performance of a Lorentz covariant\nalgorithm are invariant. To acquire the advantages of symplectic algorithms and\nLorentz covariance, a general procedure for constructing Lorentz covariant\ncanonical symplectic algorithms (LCCSA) is provided, based on which an explicit\nLCCSA for dynamics of relativistic charged particles is built. LCCSA possesses\nLorentz invariance as well as long-term numerical accuracy and stability, due\nto the preservation of discrete symplectic structure and Lorentz symmetry of\nthe system. For situations with time-dependent electromagnetic fields, which is\ndifficult to handle in traditional construction procedures of symplectic\nalgorithms, LCCSA provides a perfect explicit canonical symplectic solution by\nimplementing the discretization in 4-spacetime. We also show that LCCSA has\nbuilt-in energy-based adaptive time steps, which can optimize the computation\nperformance when the Lorentz factor varies.\n", "  Fragmentation methods such as the many-body expansion (MBE) are a common\nstrategy to model large systems by partitioning energies into a hierarchy of\ndecreasingly significant contributions. The number of fragments required for\nchemical accuracy is still prohibitively expensive for ab-initio MBE to compete\nwith force field approximations for applications beyond single-point energies.\nAlongside the MBE, empirical models of ab-initio potential energy surfaces have\nimproved, especially non-linear models based on neural networks (NN) which can\nreproduce ab-initio potential energy surfaces rapidly and accurately. Although\nthey are fast, NNs suffer from their own curse of dimensionality; they must be\ntrained on a representative sample of chemical space. In this paper we examine\nthe synergy of the MBE and NN's, and explore their complementarity. The MBE\noffers a systematic way to treat systems of arbitrary size and intelligently\nsample chemical space. NN's reduce, by a factor in excess of $10^6$ the\ncomputational overhead of the MBE and reproduce the accuracy of ab-initio\ncalculations without specialized force fields. We show they are remarkably\ngeneral, providing comparable accuracy with drastically different chemical\nembeddings. To assess this we test a new chemical embedding which can be\ninverted to predict molecules with desired properties.\n", "  Pt/Co/heavy metal (HM) tri-layered structures with interfacial perpendicular\nmagnetic anisotropy (PMA) are currently under intensive research for several\nemerging spintronic effects, such as spinorbit torque, domain wall motion, and\nroom temperature skyrmions. HM materials are used as capping layers to generate\nthe structural asymmetry and enhance the interfacial effects. For instance, the\nPt/Co/Ta structure attracts a lot of attention as it may exhibit large\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. However, the dependence of magnetic\nproperties on different capping materials has not been systematically\ninvestigated. In this paper, we experimentally show the interfacial PMA and\ndamping constant for Pt/Co/HM tri-layered structures through time-resolved\nmagneto-optical Kerr effect measurements as well as magnetometry measurements,\nwhere the capping HM materials are W, Ta, and Pd. We found that the Co/HM\ninterface plays an important role on the magnetic properties. In particular,\nthe magnetic multilayers with a W capping layer features the lowest effective\ndamping value, which may be attributed to the different spin-orbit coupling and\ninterfacial hybridization between Co and HM materials. Our findings allow a\ndeep understanding of the Pt/Co/HM tri-layered structures. Such structures\ncould lead to a better era of data storage and processing devices.\n", "  We study the Sine-Gordon model with Minkowski signature in the framework of\nperturbative algebraic quantum field theory. We calculate the vertex operator\nalgebra braiding property. We prove that in the finite regime of the model, the\nexpectation value - with respect to the vacuum or a Hadamard state - of the\nEpstein Glaser S-matrix and the interacting current or the field respectively,\nboth given as formal power series, converge.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient numerical method to compute\nthe dynamics of the rotating two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates\n(BEC). Using the rotating Lagrangian coordinates transform \\cite{BMTZ2013}, we\nreformulate the original coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (CGPE) into new\nequations where the rotating term vanishes and the potential becomes\ntime-dependent. A time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral method is proposed to\nsimulate the new equations where the nonlocal Dipole-Dipole Interactions (DDI)\nare computed by a newly-developed Gaussian-sum (GauSum) solver \\cite{EMZ2015}\nwhich helps achieve spectral accuracy in space within $O(N\\log N)$ operations\n($N$ is the total number of grid points). The new method is spectrally accurate\nin space and second order accurate in time, and the accuracies are confirmed\nnumerically. Dynamical properties of some physical quantities, including the\ntotal mass, energy, center of mass and angular momentum expectation, are\npresented and confirmed numerically. Interesting dynamics phenomena that are\npeculiar to the rotating two-component dipolar BECs, such as dynamics of center\nof mass, quantized vortex lattices dynamics and the collapse dynamics of 3D\ncases, are presented.\n", "  Heavy neutrinos with masses below the electroweak scale can simultaneously\ngenerate the light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and the baryon\nasymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis. The requirement to explain these\nphenomena imposes constraints on the mass spectrum of the heavy neutrinos,\ntheir flavour mixing pattern and their $CP$ properties. We first combine bounds\nfrom different experiments in the past to map the viable parameter regions in\nwhich the minimal low scale seesaw model can explain the observed neutrino\noscillations, while being consistent with the negative results of past searches\nfor physics beyond the Standard Model. We then study which additional\npredictions for the properties of the heavy neutrinos can be made based on the\nrequirement to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. Finally,\nwe comment on the perspectives to find traces of heavy neutrinos in future\nexperimental searches at the LHC, NA62, BELLE II, T2K, SHiP or a future high\nenergy collider, such as ILC, CEPC or FCC-ee. If any heavy neutral leptons are\ndiscovered in the future, our results can be used to assess whether these\nparticles are indeed the common origin of the light neutrino masses and the\nbaryon asymmetry of the universe. If the magnitude of their couplings to all\nStandard Model flavours can be measured individually, and if the Dirac phase in\nthe lepton mixing matrix is determined in neutrino oscillation experiments,\nthen all model parameters can in principle be determined from this data. This\nmakes the low scale seesaw a fully testable model of neutrino masses and\nbaryogenesis.\n", "  Local environment of fluorescent dyes could strongly affect emission dynamics\nof the latter. In particular, both signal intensities and emission lifetimes\nare highly sensitive to solvent temperatures. Here, temperature-dependent\nbehavior Rhodamine B fluorescence in water and ethanol solutions was\nexperimentally investigated. Phase transition point of liquid water to ice was\nshown to have a dramatic impact on both in intensity (30-fold drop) and in\nlifetime (from 2.68ns down to 0.13ns) of the dye luminescence along with the\nspectral shift of spectral maxima from 590 to 625nm. At the same time, ethanol\nsolvent does not lead any similar behavior. The reported results and approaches\nenable further investigations of dye-solvent interactions and studies of\nphysical properties of liquids at phase transition points.\n", "  We analyze the dynamics of a Bianchi I cosmology in the presence of a viscous\nfluid, causally regularized according to the Lichnerowicz approach. We show how\nthe effect induced by shear viscosity is still able to produce a matter\ncreation phenomenon, meaning that also in the regularized theory we address,\nthe Universe is emerging from a singularity with a vanishing energy density\nvalue. We discuss the structure of the singularity in the isotropic limit, when\nbulk viscosity is the only retained contribution. We see that, as far as\nviscosity is not a dominant effect, the dynamics of the isotropic Universe\npossesses the usual inviscid power-law behavior but in correspondence of\naneffective equation of state, depending on the bulk viscosity coefficient.\nFinally, we show that, in the limit of a strong non-thermodynamical equilibrium\nof the Universe mimicked by a dominant contribution of the effective viscous\npressure, a power-law inflation behavior of the Universe appears, the\ncosmological horizons are removed and a significant amount of entropy is\nproduced.\n", "  We present a diagrammatic formulation of recently-revived covariant\nfunctional approaches to one-loop matching from an ultraviolet (UV) theory to a\nlow-energy effective field theory. Various terms following from a covariant\nderivative expansion (CDE) are represented by diagrams which, unlike\nconventional Feynman diagrams, involve gauge-covariant quantities and are thus\ndubbed \"covariant diagrams.\" The use of covariant diagrams helps organize and\nsimplify one-loop matching calculations, which we illustrate with examples. Of\nparticular interest is the derivation of UV model-independent universal\nresults, which reduce matching calculations of specific UV models to\napplications of master formulas. We show how such derivation can be done in a\nmore concise manner than the previous literature, and discuss how additional\nstructures that are not directly captured by existing universal results,\nincluding mixed heavy-light loops, open covariant derivatives, and mixed\nstatistics, can be easily accounted for.\n", "  The field equations for static EGBM gravity are obtained and transformed to\nan equivalent form through a coordinate redefinition. A form for one of the\nmetric potentials that generalises the spheroidal ansatz of Vaidya--Tikekar\nsuperdense stars and additionally prescribing the electric field intensity\nyields viable solutions. Some special cases of the general solution are\nconsidered and analogous classes in the Einstein framework are studied. In\nparticular the Finch--Skea ansatz is examined in detail and found to satisfy\nthe elementary physical requirements. These include positivity of pressure and\ndensity, the existence of a pressure free hypersurface marking the boundary,\ncontinuity with the exterior metric, a subluminal sound speed as well as the\nenergy conditions. Moreover, the solution possesses no coordinate\nsingularities. It is found that the impact of the Gauss--Bonnet term is to\ncorrect undesirable features in the pressure profile and sound speed index when\ncompared to the equivalent Einstein gravity model. Furthermore graphical\nanalyses suggest that higher densities are achievable for the same radial\nvalues when compared to the 5--dimensional Einstein case. The case of a\nconstant gravitational potential, isothermal distribution as well as an\nincompressible fluid are studied. All exact solutions derived exhibit an\nequation of state explicitly.\n", "  Synchronization is essential for proper functioning of the power grid. We\ninvestigate the synchronous state and its stability for a network with a cyclic\ntopology and with the evolution of the states satisfying the swing equations.\nWe calculate the number of stable equilibria and investigate both the linear\nand nonlinear stability of the synchronous state. The linear stability analysis\nshows that the stability of the state, determined by the smallest nonzero\neigenvalue, is inversely proportional to the size of the network. The nonlinear\nstability, which we calculated by comparing the potential energy of the type-1\nsaddles with that of the stable synchronous state, depends on the network size\n($N$) in a more complicated fashion. In particular we find that when the\ngenerators and consumers are evenly distributed in an alternating way, the\nenergy barrier, preventing loss of synchronization approaches a constant value.\nFor a heterogeneous distribution of generators and consumers, the energy\nbarrier will decrease with $N$. The more heterogeneous the distribution is, the\nstronger the energy barrier depends on $N$. Finally, we found that by comparing\nsituations with equal line loads in cyclic and tree networks, tree networks\nexhibit reduced stability. This difference disappears in the limit of\n$N\\to\\infty$. This finding corroborates previous results reported in the\nliterature and suggests that cyclic (sub)networks may be applied to enhance\npower transfer while maintaining stable synchronous operation.\n", "  Recent surveys have uncovered an exciting new population of\nultra-short-period (USP) planets with orbital periods less than a day. These\nplanets typically have radii <1.5 Earth radii, indicating that they likely have\nrocky compositions. This stands in contrast to the overall distribution of\nplanets out to ~100 days, which is dominated by low-density sub-Neptunes above\n2 Earth radii, which must have gaseous envelopes to explain their size.\nHowever, on ultra-short-period orbits, planets are bombarded by intense levels\nof photo-ionizing radiation and consequently gaseous sub-Neptunes are extremely\nvulnerable to losing their envelopes to atmospheric photo-evaporation. Using\nmodels of planet evolution, I show that the rocky USP planets can easily be\nproduced as the evaporated remnants of sub-Neptunes with H/He envelopes and\nthat we can therefore understand the observed dearth of USP sub-Neptunes as a\nnatural consequence of photo-evaporation. Critically however, planets on USP\norbits could often retain their envelopes if they formed with very\nhigh-metallicity water dominated envelopes. Such water-rich planets would\ncommonly be >2 Earth radii today, which is inconsistent with the observed\nevaporation desert, indicating that most USP planets likely formed from\nwater-poor material within the snow-line. Finally, I examine the special case\nof 55 Cancri e and its possible composition in the light of recent\nobservations, and discuss the prospects for further characterizing this\npopulation with future observations.\n", "  Understanding the microscopic mechanism of coexisting long-range orders (such\nas lattice supersolidity) in strongly correlated systems is a subject of\nimmense interest. We study the possible manifestations of long-range orders,\nincluding lattice-supersolid phases with differently broken symmetry, in a\ntwo-dimensional square lattice system of hard-core bosons (HCBs) coupled to\narchetypal cooperative/coherent normal-mode distortions such as those in\nperovskites. At strong HCB-phonon coupling, using a duality transformation to\nmap the strong-coupling problem to a weak-coupling one, we obtain an effective\nHamiltonian involving nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and\nnext-to-next-nearest-neighbor hoppings and repulsions. Using stochastic series\nexpansion quantum Monte Carlo, we construct the phase diagram of the system. As\ncoupling strength is increased, we find that the system undergoes a first-order\nquantum phase transition from a superfluid to a checkerboard solid at half\nfilling and from a superfluid to a diagonal striped solid [with crystalline\nordering wavevector $\\vec{Q}=(2\\pi/3,2\\pi/3)$ or $(2\\pi/3,4\\pi/3)$] at\none-third filling without showing any evidence of supersolidity. On tuning the\nsystem away from these commensurate fillings, checkerboard supersolid is\ngenerated near half filling whereas a rare diagonal striped supersolid is\nrealized near one-third filling. Interestingly, there is an asymmetry in the\nextent of supersolidity about one-third filling. Within our framework, we also\nprovide an explanation for the observed checkerboard and stripe formations in\n${\\rm La}_{2-x}{\\rm Sr}_x{\\rm NiO_4}$ at $x=1/2$ and $x=1/3$.\n", "  We develop a new operator algebraic formulation of the Nakajima-Mori-Zwanzig\n(NMZ) method of projections. The new theory is built upon rigorous mathematical\nfoundations, and it can be applied to both classical and quantum systems. We\nshow that a duality principle between the NMZ formulation in the space of\nobservables and in the state space can be established, analogous to the\nHeisenberg and Schr\\\"odinger pictures in quantum mechanics. Based on this\nduality we prove that, under natural assumptions, the projection operators\nappearing in the NMZ equation must be conditional expectations. The proposed\nformulation is illustrated in various examples.\n", "  We consider bosonic random matrix partition functions at nonzero chemical\npotential and compare the chiral condensate, the baryon number density and the\nbaryon number susceptibility to the result of the corresponding fermionic\npartition function. We find that as long as results are finite, the phase\ntransition of the fermionic theory persists in the bosonic theory. However, in\ncase that bosonic partition function diverges and has to be regularized, the\nphase transition of the fermionic theory does not occur in the bosonic theory,\nand the bosonic theory is always in the broken phase.\n", "  Thermal and many-body localized phases are separated by a dynamical phase\ntransition of a new kind. We analyze the distribution of off-diagonal matrix\nelements of local operators across the many-body localization transition (MBLT)\nin a disordered spin chain, and use it to characterize the breakdown of the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis and to extract the many-body Thouless\nenergy. We find a wide critical region around the MBLT, where Thouless energy\nbecomes smaller than the level spacing, while matrix elements show critical\ndependence on the energy difference. In the same region, matrix elements,\nviewed as amplitudes of a fictitious wave function, exhibit strong\nmultifractality. Our findings show that the correlation length becomes larger\nthan the accessible system sizes in a broad range of disorder strength values,\nand shed light on the critical behaviour of MBL systems.\n", "  This paper reports on the device processing and characterization of hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN) based solid-state thermal neutron detectors, where hBN\nthickness varied from 2.5 to 15 microns. These natural hBN epilayers (with\n19.9% B-10) were grown by a low pressure chemical vapor deposition process.\nComplete dry processing was adopted for the fabrication of these\nmetal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) configuration detectors. These detectors showed\nintrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency values of 0.86%, 2.4%, 3.15%,\nand 4.71% for natural hBN thickness values of 2.5, 7.5, 10, and 15 microns,\nrespectively. Measured efficiencies are very close (more than 92%) to the\ntheoretical maximum efficiencies for corresponding hBN thickness values for\nthese detectors. This clearly shows the hBN thickness scalability of these\ndetectors. A 15-micron thick hBN based MSM detector is expected to yield an\nefficiency of 21.4%, if enriched hBN (with ~100% B-10) is used instead of\nnatural hBN. These results demonstrate that the fabrication of hBN thickness\nscalable highly efficient thermal neutron detectors is possible.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of reducing the computational burden of LES\nmodels by employing local polynomial degree adaptivity in the framework of a\nhigh order DG method. A novel degree adaptation technique especially featured\nto be effective for LES applications is proposed and its effectiveness is\ncompared to that of other criteria already employed in the literature. The\nresulting locally adaptive approach allows to achieve significant reductions in\ncomputational cost of representative LES computations.\n", "  We report that Hybrid membrane resonators (HMRs) made of a decorated membrane\nresonator backed by a shallow cavity can function as Helmholtz resonators (HRs)\nwhen mounted on the sidewall of a clear waveguide for air ventilation. When two\nsingle-frequency HMRs are used in the same scheme as two frequency-detuned HRs,\nasymmetric total absorption/reflection is demonstrated at 286.7 Hz with\nabsorption coefficient over 97 % in a waveguide 9 cm x 9 cm in cross section.\nWhen two multiple-frequency HMRs are used, absorption in the range of near 60 %\nto above 80 % is observed at 403 Hz, 450 Hz, 688 Hz, 863 Hz and 945 Hz.\nTheoretical predictions agree well with the experimental data. The HMRs may\nreplace HRs in duct noise reduction applications in that at a single operation\nfrequency they have stronger strength to cover a much larger cross section area\nthan that of HRs with similar cavity volume, and they can be designed to\nprovide multiple frequency absorption band.\n", "  In this note we consider aspects of the current algebra interpretation of\nmulti-soft limits of tree-level gluon scattering amplitudes in four dimensions.\nBuilding on the relation between a positive helicity gluon soft-limit and the\nWard identity for a level-zero Kac-Moody current, we use the double-soft limit\nto define the Sugawara energy-momentum tensor and, by using the triple- and\nquadruple-soft limits, show that it satisfies the correct OPEs for a CFT. We\nstudy the resulting Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and show that they hold\nfor positive helicity gluons in MHV amplitudes. Turning to the sub-leading\nsoft-terms we define a one-parameter family of currents whose Ward identities\ncorrespond to the universal tree-level sub-leading soft-behaviour. We compute\nthe algebra of these currents formed with the leading currents and amongst\nthemselves. Finally, by parameterising the ambiguity in the double-soft limit\nfor mixed helicities, we introduce a non-trivial OPE between the holomorphic\nand anti-holomorphic currents and study some of its implications.\n", "  The non-relativistic wave function framework is applied to study the\nproduction and decay of the exotic hadrons which can be effectively described\nas bound states of other hadrons. Employing the factorized formulation, we\ninvestigate the production of exotic hadrons in the multiproduction processes\nat high energy hadronic colliders with the help of event generators. This study\nprovides crucial information for the measurements of the relevant exotic\nhadrons.\n", "  Experiments on the formation of magnesium complexes in $^4$He nanodroplets\nwere interpreted as the observation of the formation of weakly bound magnesium\ncomplexes. We present results for single Mg and Mg dimer solvation using the\nhypernetted chain / Euler-Lagrange method as well as path integral Monte Carlo\nsimulations. We find that the phonon-mediated, indirect Mg-Mg interaction adds\nan oscillatory component to the direct Mg-Mg interaction. We undertake a\nstep-by-step examination of the ingredients of the calculation of the\nphonon-induced interaction, comparing the results of semi-analytic HNC-EL\ncalculations for bulk and single impurity results with experiments as well as\nMonte Carlo data. We do not find evidence for a sufficiently strong secondary\nminimum in the effective Mg-Mg interaction to support a metastable state.\n", "  We present a short review of the current and recent development in the field\nof superfluid 3He and 4He. The review is based on the topics discussed at the\nNSF sponsoredWorkshop on Grand Challenges in Quantum Fluids and Solids chaired\nby Moses Chan from Pennsylvania State University and held at University of\nBuffalo in August, 2015.\n", "  In the previous paper, we have constructed two $f(T)$ models with nonminimal\ntorsion-matter coupling extension, which are successful in describing the\nevolution history of the Universe including the radiation-dominated era, the\nmatter-dominated era, and the present accelerating expansion. Meantime, the\nsignificant advantage of these models is that they could avoid the cosmological\nconstant problem of $\\Lambda$CDM. However, the nonminimal coupling between\nmatter and torsion will affect the tests of Solar system. In this paper, we\nstudy the effects of Solar system in these models, including the gravitation\nredshift, geodetic effect and perihelion preccesion. We find that Model I can\npass all three of the Solar system tests. For Model II, the parameter is\nconstrained by the measure of the perihelion precession of Mercury.\n", "  The in-plane resistivity and uniform magnetic susceptibility anisotropies of\n$BaFe_{2}As_{2}$ are obtained with a new method, in which a large\nsymmetry-breaking uniaxial strain is applied using a substrate with a very\nanisotropic thermal expansion. The resistivity anisotropy and its corresponding\nelastoresistivity exhibit very similar diverging behavior as those obtained\nfrom piezo-stack experiments. This suggests that the resistivity anisotropy is\nmore a direct measure of magnetism than of nematicity, since the nematic\ntransition is no longer well-defined under a large strain. In strong contrast\nto the large resistivity anisotropy above $T_{N}$, the anisotropy of the\nin-plane magnetic susceptibility develops largely below $T_{N}$. Using an\nitinerant model, we show that the observed anisotropy ($\\chi_{b}>\\chi_{a}$) is\ndetermined by spin-orbit coupling and the orientation of the magnetic moments\nin the antiferromagnetic phase, and that the anisotropy is dominated by\nintra-orbital ($yz,yz$) contributions of the Umklapp susceptibility.\n", "  Epidemic propagation on complex networks has been widely investigated, mostly\nwith invariant parameters. However, the process of epidemic propagation is not\nalways constant. Epidemics can be affected by various perturbations, and may\nbounce back to its original state, which is considered resilient. Here, we\nstudy the resilience of epidemics on networks, by introducing a different\ninfection rate ${\\lambda_{2}}$ during SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible)\nepidemic propagation to model perturbations (control state), whereas the\ninfection rate is ${\\lambda_{1}}$ in the rest of time. Through simulations and\ntheoretical analysis, we find that even for ${\\lambda_{2}<\\lambda_{c}}$,\nepidemics eventually could bounce back if control duration is below a\nthreshold. This critical control time for epidemic resilience, i.e.,\n${cd_{max}}$ can be predicted by the diameter (${d}$) of the underlying\nnetwork, with the quantitative relation ${cd_{max}\\sim d^{\\alpha}}$. Our\nfindings can help to design a better mitigation strategy for epidemics.\n", "  Wireless power transfer (WPT) has been an active topic of research, with a\nnumber of WPT schemes implemented in the near-field (coupling) and far-field\n(radiation) regimes. Here, we consider a beamed WPT scheme based on a\ndynamically reconfigurable source aperture transferring power to receiving\ndevices within the Fresnel (near-zone) region. In this context, the dynamic\naperture resembles a reconfigurable lens capable of focusing power to a\nwell-defined spot, whose dimension can be related to a point spread function\n(PSF). Near-zone focusing can be achieved by generating different amplitude or\nphase profiles over the aperture, which can be realized using traditional\narchitectures, such as phased arrays. Alternatively, metasurface guided-wave\napertures can achieve dynamic focusing, with potentially lower cost\nimplementations. We present an initial tradeoff analysis of the near-zone WPT\nconcept, relating key parameters such as spot size, aperture size, wavelength,\nfocal distance, and availability of sources. We find that approximate design\nformulas derived from the Gaussian optics approximation provide useful\nestimates of system performance, including transfer efficiency and coverage\nvolume. The accuracy of these formulas is confirmed using numerical\ncalculations.\n", "  It is well known that the efficiency of a good thermoelectric material should\nbe optimized with respect to doping concentration. However, much less attention\nhas been paid to the optimization of the dopant's energy level. Thermoelectric\nmaterials doped with shallow levels may experience a dramatic reduction in\ntheir figures of merit at high temperatures due to the excitation of minority\ncarriers that reduces the Seebeck coefficient and increases bipolar heat\nconduction. Doping with deep level impurities can delay the excitation of\nminority carriers as it requires a higher temperature to ionize all dopants. We\nfind through modeling that, depending on the material type and temperature\nrange of operation, different impurity levels (shallow or deep) will be desired\nto optimize the efficiency of a thermoelectric material. For different\nmaterials, we further clarify where the most preferable position of the\nimpurity level within the band gap falls. Our research provides insights in\nchoosing the most appropriate dopants for a thermoelectric material in order to\nmaximize the device efficiency.\n", "  The present work is based on a parametric reconstruction of the deceleration\nparameter $q(z)$ in a model for the spatially flat FRW universe filled with\ndark energy and non-relativistic matter. In cosmology, the parametric\nreconstruction technique deals with an attempt to build up a model by choosing\nsome specific evolution scenario for a cosmological parameter and then estimate\nthe values of the parameters with the help of different observational datasets.\nIn this paper, we have proposed a logarithmic parametrization of $q(z)$ to\nprobe the evolution history of the universe. Using the type Ia supernova\n(SNIa), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) datasets, the constraints on the arbitrary model parameters $q_{0}$ and\n$q_{1}$ are obtained (within $1\\sigma$ and $2\\sigma$ confidence limits) by\n$\\chi^{2}$-minimization technique. We have then reconstructed the deceleration\nparameter, the total EoS parameter $\\omega_{tot}$, the jerk parameter and have\ncompared the reconstructed results of $q(z)$ with other well-known\nparametrizations of $q(z)$. We have also shown that two model selection\ncriteria (namely, Akaike information criterion and Bayesian Information\nCriterion) provide the clear indication that our reconstructed model is well\nconsistent with other popular models.\n", "  It is generally impossible to separately measure the resistance of the\nfunctional component (i.e., the intrinsic device materials) and the parasitic\ncomponent (i.e., terminals, interfaces and serial loads) in a two-terminal\ndevice. Yet such knowledge is important for understanding device physics and\ndesigning device systems. Here, we consider a case where an electric current,\ntemperature, or magnetic field causes a small but identical relative\nconductivity change of the device materials. We find an exact solution to this\nrelative change by a simple resistance-data analysis of similarly configured\ntwo-terminal devices. The solution is obtainable even if the change is quite\nsmall, say, less than 0.1%. In special cases of small relative changes in\nparasitic resistance, the absolute parasitic resistance is also obtainable. Our\nmethod is especially useful for studying the switching and transport\ncharacteristics of the emergent non-volatile resistance memory.\n", "  The low-energy effective theories for gapped insulators are classified by\nthree parameters: permittivity $\\epsilon$, permeability $\\mu$, and theta angle\n$\\theta$. Crystals with periodic $\\epsilon$ are known as photonic crystals. We\nhere study the band structure of photons in a new type of crystals with\nperiodic $\\theta$ (modulo $2\\pi$) in space, which we call the axion crystals.\nWe find that the axion crystals have a number of new properties that the usual\nphotonic crystals do not possess, such as the helicity-dependent mass gap and\nnonrelativistic gapless dispersion relation at small momentum. We briefly\ndiscuss possible realizations of axion crystals in condensed matter systems and\nhigh-energy physics.\n", "  A particular two-parameter class of little string theories can be described\nby $M$ parallel M5-branes probing a transverse affine $A_{N-1}$ singularity. We\npreviously discussed the duality between the theories labelled by $(N,M)$ and\n$(M,N)$. In this work, we propose that these two are in fact only part of a\nlarger web of dual theories. We provide evidence that the theories labelled by\n$(N,M)$ and $(\\tfrac{NM}{k},k)$ are dual to each other, where\n$k=\\text{gcd}(N,M)$. To argue for this duality, we use a geometric realization\nof these little string theories in terms of F-theory compactifications on\ntoric, non-compact Calabi-Yau threefolds $X_{N,M}$ which have a double elliptic\nfibration structure. We show explicitly for a number of examples that\n$X_{NM/k,k}$ is part of the extended moduli space of $X_{N,M}$, i.e. the two\nare related through symmetry transformations and flop transitions. By working\nout the full duality map, we provide a simple check at the level of the free\nenergy of the little string theories.\n", "  We study the distinguishability notion given by Wootters for states\nrepresented by probability density functions. This presents the particularity\nthat it can also be used for defining a distance in chaotic unidimensional\nmaps. Based on that definition, we provide a metric $\\overline{d}$ for an\narbitrary discrete map. Moreover, from this we associate a metric space to each\ninvariant density of a given map, which results to be the set of all\ndistinguished points when the number of iterations of the map tends to\ninfinity. Also, we give a characterization of the wandering set of a map in\nterms of the given metric which allows to identify the dissipative regions in\nthe phase space. We illustrate the results in the case of the logistic and the\ncircle maps numerically and theoretically, and we obtain the metric and the\nwandering set for some characteristic values of their parameters.\n", "  We obtain an asymptotic formula, as $n\\to\\infty$, for the monomer-monomer\ncorrelation function $K_2(x,y)$ in the classical dimer model on a triangular\nlattice, with the horizontal and vertical weights $w_h=w_v=1$ and the diagonal\nweight $w_d=t>0$, where $x$ and $y$ are sites $n$ spaces apart in adjacent\nrows.\n  We find that $t_c=\\frac{1}{2}$ is a critical value of $t$. We prove that in\nthe subcritical case, $0<t<\\frac{1}{2}$, as $n\\to\\infty$,\n$K_2(x,y)=K_2(\\infty)\\left[1-\\frac{e^{-n/\\xi}}{n}\\,\\Big(C_1+C_2(-1)^n+\\mathcal\nO(n^{-1})\\Big)\\right]$, with explicit formulae for $K_2(\\infty)$, $\\xi$, $C_1$,\nand $C_2$. In the supercritical case, $\\frac{1}{2} < t < 1$, we prove that as\n$n\\to\\infty$, $K_2(x,y)=K_2(\\infty)\\Bigg[1- \\frac{e^{-n/\\xi}}{n}\\,\n\\Big(C_1\\cos(\\omega n+\\varphi_1)+C_2(-1)^n\\cos(\\omega n+\\varphi_2)+\nC_3+C_4(-1)^n$ $+\\mathcal O(n^{-1})\\Big)\\Bigg]$, with explicit formulae for\n$K_2(\\infty)$, $\\xi$, $\\omega$, and $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_4$, $\\varphi_1$,\n$\\varphi_2$. The proof is based on an extension of the\nBorodin-Okounkov-Case-Geronimo formula to block Toeplitz determinants and on an\nasymptotic analysis of the Fredholm determinants in hand.\n", "  We present new results from our ongoing study of the SU(3) sextet model with\ntwo flavors in the two-index symmetric representation of the gauge group. In\nthe simulations use unimproved Wilson fermions to investigate the infrared\nproperties of the model. We have previously presented results for the spectrum\nof the model in the weak coupling regime. Here, to better understand the\noverall behavior of the lattice model, we map its non-trivial phase structure\nin the space of bare parameters. At strong coupling, we observe a first order\nphase transition when decreasing the bare quark mass. This first order\ntransition weakens when moving towards weaker couplings with an endpoint at a\nfinite value of the bare coupling, after which it appears to be a continuous\ntransition. We also investigate the behavior of the mass spectrum and\nscale-setting observable, as a function of the quark mass, and show that their\nqualitative behavior change significantly when moving from the strong coupling\ninto the weak coupling phase.\n", "  We measure and analyze reflection spectra of directly coupled systems of\nwaveguides and cavities. The observed Fano lines offer insight in the\nreflection and coupling processes. Very different from side-coupled systems,\nthe observed Fano line shape is not caused by the termini of the waveguide, but\nthe coupling process between the measurement device fiber and the waveguide.\nOur experimental results and analytical model show that the Fano parameter that\ndescribes the Fano line shape is very sensitive to the coupling condition. A\nmovement of the fiber well below the Rayleigh range can lead to a drastic\nchange of the Fano line shape.\n", "  Using tempered Monte Carlo simulations, we study the the spin-glass phase of\ndense packings of Ising dipoles pointing along random axes. We consider systems\nof L^3 dipoles (a) placed on the sites of a simple cubic lattice with lattice\nconstant $d$, (b) placed at the center of randomly closed packed spheres of\ndiameter d that occupy a 64% of the volume. For both cases we find an\nequilibrium spin-glass phase below a temperature T_sg. We compute the\nspin-glass overlap parameter q and their associated correlation length xi_L.\nFrom the variation of xi_L with T and L we determine T_sg for both systems. In\nthe spin-glass phase, we find (a) <q> decreases algebraically with L, and (b)\nxi_L/L does not diverge as L increases. At very low temperatures we find\ncomb-like distributions of q that are sample-dependent. We find that the\nfraction of samples with cross-overlap spikes higher than a certain value as\nwell as the average width of the spikes are size independent quantities. All\nthese results are consistent with a quasi-long-range order in the spin-glass\nphase, as found previously for very diluted dipolar systems.\n", "  We study CFT data of 3-dimensional superconformal field theories (SCFTs)\narising from wrapped two M5-branes on closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Via\nso-called 3d/3d correspondence, central charges of these SCFTs are related to a\n$SL(2)$ Chern-Simons (CS) invariant on the 3-manifolds. We give a rigorous\ndefinition of the invariant in terms of resurgence theory and a state-integral\nmodel for the complex CS theory. We numerically evaluate the central charges\nfor several closed 3-manifolds with small hyperbolic volume. The computation\nsuggests that the wrapped M5-brane systems give infinitely many discrete SCFTs\nwith small central charges. We also analyze these `minimal' SCFTs in the eye of\n3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal bootstrap.\n", "  In this work we study linear and non-linear cosmological interactions, which\ndepend on dark matter and dark energy densities in the framework of General\nRelativity. By using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian\ninformation criterion (BIC) with data from SnIa (Union 2.1 and binned JLA),\nH(z), BAO and CMB we compare the interacting models among themselves and\nanalyze whether more complex interacting models are favored by these criteria.\nIn this context, we find some suitable interactions that alleviate the\ncoincidence problem.\n", "  A three-dimensional (3D) Poisson solver with longitudinal periodic and\ntransverse open boundary conditions can have important applications in beam\nphysics of particle accelerators. In this paper, we present a fast efficient\nmethod to solve the Poisson equation using a spectral finite-difference method.\nThis method uses a computational domain that contains the charged particle beam\nonly and has a computational complexity of $O(N_u(logN_{mode}))$, where $N_u$\nis the total number of unknowns and $N_{mode}$ is the maximum number of\nlongitudinal or azimuthal modes. This saves both the computational time and the\nmemory usage by using an artificial boundary condition in a large extended\ncomputational domain.\n", "  We use the Fourier based Gabetta-Toscani-Wennberg (GTW) metric $d_2$ to study\nthe rate of convergence to equilibrium for the Kac model in $1$ dimension. We\ntake the initial velocity distribution of the particles to be a Borel\nprobability measure $\\mu$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ that is symmetric in all its\nvariables, has mean $\\vec{0}$ and finite second moment. Let $\\mu_t(dv)$ denote\nthe Kac-evolved distribution at time $t$, and let $R_\\mu$ be the angular\naverage of $\\mu$. We give an upper bound to $d_2(\\mu_t, R_\\mu)$ of the form\n$\\min\\{ B e^{-\\frac{4 \\lambda_1}{n+3}t}, d_2(\\mu,R_\\mu)\\}$, where $\\lambda_1 =\n\\frac{n+2}{2(n-1)}$ is the gap of the Kac model in $L^2$ and $B$ depends only\non the second moment of $\\mu$. We also construct a family of Schwartz\nprobability densities $\\{f_0^{(n)}: \\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\}$ with\nfinite second moments that shows practically no decrease in $d_2(f_0(t),\nR_{f_0})$ for time at least $\\frac{1}{2\\lambda}$ with $\\lambda$ the rate of the\nKac operator. We also present a propagation of chaos result for the partially\nthermostated Kac model in [14].\n", "  We give a short and rigorous proof of the existence and uniqueness of the\nsolution of Liouville equation with sources, both elliptic and parabolic, on\nthe sphere and on all higher genus compact Riemann surfaces.\n", "  This article describes algorithms for the hybrid parallelization and SIMD\nvectorization of molecular dynamics simulations with short-range forces. The\nparallelization method combines domain decomposition with a thread-based\nparallelization approach. The goal of the work is to enable efficient\nsimulations of very large (tens of millions of atoms) and inhomogeneous systems\non many-core processors with hundreds or thousands of cores and SIMD units with\nlarge vector sizes. In order to test the efficiency of the method, simulations\nof a variety of configurations with up to 74 million atoms have been performed.\nResults are shown that were obtained on multi-core systems with Sandy Bridge\nand Haswell processors as well as systems with Xeon Phi many-core processors.\n", "  It turns out that a parametrization of degenerate density matrices requires a\nparametrization of $\\mathfrak{F}=U(n)/({U(k_1)\\times U(k_2)\\times \\cdots \\times\nU(k_m)})\\quad n=k_1 +\\cdots + k_m $ where $U(k)$ denotes the set of all unitary\n$k\\times k$-matrices with complex entries. Unfortunately the parametrization of\nthis quotient space is quite involved. Our solution does not rely on Lie\nalgebra methods {directly,} but succeeds through the construction of suitable\nsections for natural projections, by using techniques from the theory of\nhomogeneous spaces. We mention the relation to the Lie algebra back ground and\nconclude with two concrete examples.\n", "  We give a prescription to perform the continuum limit of the $d$-dimensional\nHubbard model in the presence of a harmonic trap at zero temperature. We\nperform the continuum limit at fixed number of particles. In $d\\geq3$ the\nlattice system of spin-1/2 particles is mapped into a non-interacting\ntwo-component Fermi gas in a harmonic trap. In $d=1$ and $d=2$ the particles\nwith opposite spin interact via a Dirac delta interaction. We show that the\nproperties of this continuum limit can be put in correspondence with those\nderived applying the Trap-Size scaling (TSS) formalism to the confined Hubbard\nmodel in the so called Dilute Regime (fixed number of particles and weak\nconfinement). The correspondence in $d=1$ and $d=2$ has been tested comparing\nthe numerical results obtained for lattice system with those of the continuum\nlimit in the case of two-particle and in absence of spin-polarization\n($N=2$,$N_{\\uparrow}=N_{\\downarrow}=1$).\n", "  We argue that the experimentally easily accessible optical absorption\nspectrum can often be used to distinguish between a random alloy phase and a\nstoichiometrically equivalent core/shell realization of ensembles of\nmonodisperse colloidal semiconductor quantum dots without the need for more\nadvanced structural characterization tools. Our proof-of-concept is performed\nby conceptually straightforward exact-disorder tight-binding calculations. The\nunderlying stochastical tight-binding scheme only parametrizes bulk band\nstructure properties and does not employ additional free parameters to\ncalculate the optical absorption spectrum, which is an easily accessible\nexperimental property. The method is applied to selected realizations of type-I\nCd(Se,S) and type-II (Zn,Cd)(Se,S) alloyed quantum dots with an underlying\nzincblende crystal structure and the corresponding core/shell counterparts.\n", "  We investigate driven wave turbulence in non-Abelian plasmas, in the\nframework of kinetic theory where both elastic and inelastic processes are\nconsidered in the small angle approximation. The gluon spectrum, that forms in\nthe presence of a steady source, is shown to be controlled by nonlocal\ninteractions in momentum space, in contrast to the universal\nKolmogorov-Zakharov spectra. Assuming strongly nonlocal interactions, we show\nthat inelastic processes are dominant in the IR and cause a thermal bath to\nform below the forcing scale, as a result of a detailed balance between\nradiation and absorption of soft gluons by the hard ones. Above the forcing\nscale, the inelastic collision term reduces to an inhomogeneous diffusion-like\nequation yielding a spectrum that spreads to the UV as $t^{1/2}$, similarly to\nelastic processes. Due to nonlocal interactions the non-universal turbulent\nspectrum is not steady and flattens when time goes on toward the thermal\ndistribution. This analysis is complemented by numerical simulations, where we\nobserve that in the explored time interval the spectral exponent of the\nnonlocal turbulent cascade is close to $-2$ in agreement with simulations of\nclassical Yang-Mills equations.\n", "  The Askey--Wilson algebras were used to interpret the algebraic structure\nhidden in the Racah--Wigner coefficients of the quantum algebra\n$U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. In this paper, we display an injection of a universal\nanalog $\\triangle_q$ of Askey--Wilson algebras into\n$U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)\\otimes U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)\\otimes U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$\nbehind the application. Moreover we formulate the decomposition rules for\n$3$-fold tensor products of irreducible Verma $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-modules\nand of finite-dimensional irreducible $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-modules into the\ndirect sums of finite-dimensional irreducible $\\triangle_q$-modules.\n", "  The development of reduced models for complex multiscale problems remains one\nof the principal challenges in computational physics. The optimal prediction\nframework of Chorin et al., which is a reformulation of the Mori-Zwanzig (M-Z)\nformalism of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, provides a methodology for\nthe development of mathematically-derived reduced models of dynamical systems.\nSeveral promising models have emerged from the optimal prediction community and\nhave found application in molecular dynamics and turbulent flows. In this work,\na new M-Z-based closure model that addresses some of the deficiencies of\nexisting methods is developed. The model is constructed by exploiting\nsimilarities between two levels of coarse-graining via the Germano identity of\nfluid mechanics and by assuming that memory effects have a finite temporal\nsupport. The appeal of the proposed model, which will be referred to as the\n`dynamic-MZ-$\\tau$' model, is that it is parameter-free and has a structural\nform imposed by the mathematics of the coarse-graining process (rather than the\nphenomenological assumptions made by the modeler, such as in classical subgrid\nscale models). To promote the applicability of M-Z models in general, two\nprocedures are presented to compute the resulting model form, helping to bypass\nthe tedious error-prone algebra that has proven to be a hindrance to the\nconstruction of M-Z-based models for complex dynamical systems. While the new\nformulation is applicable to the solution of general partial differential\nequations, demonstrations are presented in the context of Large Eddy Simulation\nclosures for Burgers equation, decaying homogeneous turbulence, and turbulent\nchannel flow. The performance of the model and validity of the underlying\nassumptions are investigated in detail.\n", "  The search for dark matter (DM) is one of the most active and challenging\nareas of current research. Possible DM candidates are ultralight fields such as\naxions and weak interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Axions piled up in the\ncenter of stars are supposed to generate matter/DM configurations with\noscillating geometries at a very rapid frequency, which is a multiple of the\naxion mass $m_B$ [1,2]. Borra and Trottier recently found peculiar ultrafast\nperiodic spectral modulations in $236$ main sequence stars in the sample of\n$2.5$ million spectra of galactic halo stars of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nthat were interpreted as optical signals from extraterrestrial civilizations,\npossible candidates for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)\nprogram [3]. We argue, instead, that this could be the first indirect evidence\nof bosonic axion-like DM fields inside main sequence stars, with a stable\nradiative nucleus, where a stable DM core can be hosted. These oscillations\nwere not observed in earlier stellar spectral classes probably because of the\nimpossibility of starting a stable oscillatory regime due to the presence of\nchaotic motions in their convective nuclei. The axion mass values, $(50 < m_B <\n2.4 \\times 10^{3})~ \\mathrm{\\mu eV}$, obtained from the frequency range\nobserved by Borra and Trottier, $(0.6077< f <0.6070$) THz, agree with the\nrecent theoretical results from high-temperature lattice quantum chromodynamics\n[4,5].\n", "  As we know that the Lovelock theory is an extension of the general relativity\nto the higher-dimensions, in this theory the first and the second order terms\ncorrespond to the general relativity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity,\nrespectively. We obtain a $5D$ black hole solution in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet\ngravity surrounded by the quintessence matter, and also analyze their\nthermodynamical properties. Owing to the quintessence corrected black hole, the\nthermodynamic quantities have also been corrected except for the black hole\nentropy, and phase transition is achievable. The phase transition for the\nthermodynamic stability, is characterized by a discontinuity in the specific\nheat at $r=r_C$, with the stable (unstable) branch for $r < (>) r_C$.\n", "  We compute one-loop amplitudes in six-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with\nhalf-maximal supersymmetry from first principles: imposing gauge invariance and\nlocality on an ansatz made from string-theory inspired kinematic building\nblocks yields unique expressions for the 3- and 4-point amplitudes. We check\nthat the results are reproduced in the field-theory limit $\\alpha' \\rightarrow\n0$ of string amplitudes in K3 orbifolds, using simplifications made in a\ncompanion string-theory paper 1603.05262.\n", "  The SuperNovae Analysis aPplication (SNAP) is a new tool for the analysis of\nSN observations and validation of SN models. SNAP consists of an open source\nrelational database with (a) observational light curve, (b) theoretical light\ncurve, and (c) correlation table sets, statistical comparison software, and a\nweb interface available to the community. The theoretical models are intended\nto span a gridded range of parameter space. The goal is to have users to upload\nnew SN models or new SN observations and run the comparison software to\ndetermine correlations via the web site. There are looming problems on the\nhorizon that SNAP begins to solve. Namely, large surveys will discover\nthousands of SNe annually. Frequently, the parameter space of a new SN event is\nunbounded. SNAP will be a resource to constrain parameters and determine if an\nevent needs follow-up without spending resources to create new light curve\nmodels from scratch. Secondly, there is not a rapidly available, systematic way\nto determine degeneracies between parameters or even what physics is needed to\nmodel a realistic SNe. The correlations made within the SNAP system begin to\nsolve these problems.\n", "  The inverse Ising problem seeks to reconstruct the parameters of an Ising\nHamiltonian on the basis of spin configurations sampled from the Boltzmann\nmeasure. Over the last decade, many applications of the inverse Ising problem\nhave arisen, driven by the advent of large-scale data across different\nscientific disciplines. Recently, strategies to solve the inverse Ising problem\nbased on convex optimisation have proven to be very successful. These\napproaches maximise particular objective functions with respect to the model\nparameters. Examples are the pseudolikelihood method and interaction screening.\nIn this paper, we establish a link between approaches to the inverse Ising\nproblem based on convex optimisation and the statistical physics of disordered\nsystems. We characterise the performance of an arbitrary objective function and\ncalculate the objective function which optimally reconstructs the model\nparameters. We evaluate the optimal objective function within a\nreplica-symmetric ansatz and compare the results of the optimal objective\nfunction with other reconstruction methods. Apart from giving a theoretical\nunderpinning to solving the inverse Ising problem by convex optimisation, the\noptimal objective function outperforms state-of-the-art methods, albeit by a\nsmall margin.\n", "  In this paper we present a generalized analytical solution to the generalized\nstate equations of coupled second-order non-autonomous circuit systems. The\nanalytical solutions thus obtained are used to study the synchronization\ndynamics of two different types of circuit systems, differing only by their\nconstituting nonlinear element. The synchronization dynamics of the coupled\nsystems are studied through two-parameter bifurcation diagrams, phase portraits\nand time-series plots obtained from the explicit analytical solutions. The\nmechanism of synchronization is realized through the bifurcation of the\neigenvalues as functions of the control parameter in each of the coupled\npiecewise linear regions of the drive and response systems. The stability of\nthe synchronized state for coupled identical chaotic states are studeid through\nthe {\\emph{master stability function}}. Further, {\\emph{conditional Lyapunov\nexponents}} and {\\emph{Kaplan-Yorke dimension}} are obtained to confirm the\nsynchronized states of both coupled identical and non-identical chaotic states.\nThe synchronization dynamics of coupled chaotic systems studied through\ntwo-parameter bifurcation diagrams obtained from explicit analytical solutions\nis reported in the literature for the first time.\n", "  Leptoquarks have been proposed as a possible explanation of anomalies in\n$\\bar{B}\\mapsto D^{*} \\tau \\bar{\\nu } $ decays, the apparent anomalies in\n$(g-2)_\\mu$ experiments and a violation of lepton universality. Motivated by\nthis, we examine other motivations of leptoquarks: radiatively induced neutrino\nmasses in the presence of a discrete symmetry that prevents a tree level\nsee-saw mechanism, gauge coupling unification, and vacuum stability at least up\nto the unification scale. We present a new model for radiatively generating a\nneutrino mass which can significantly improve gauge coupling unification at one\nloop. We discuss this, and other models in the light of recent work on flavour\nanomalies.\n", "  We consider the late time behavior of the analytically continued partition\nfunction $Z(\\beta + it) Z(\\beta - it)$ in holographic $2d$ CFTs. This is a\nprobe of information loss in such theories and in their holographic duals. We\nshow that each Virasoro character decays in time, and so information is not\nrestored at the level of individual characters. We identify a universal\ndecaying contribution at late times, and conjecture that it describes the\nbehavior of generic chaotic $2d$ CFTs out to times that are exponentially large\nin the central charge. It was recently suggested that at sufficiently late\ntimes one expects a crossover to random matrix behavior. We estimate an upper\nbound on the crossover time, which suggests that the decay is followed by a\nparametrically long period of late time growth. Finally, we discuss integrable\ntheories and show how information is restored at late times by a series of\ncharacters. This hints at a possible bulk mechanism, where information is\nrestored by an infinite sum over non-perturbative saddles.\n", "  In this Letter, the dynamic behavior of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)\nsteering and the redistribution of EPR steering under a relativistic framework\nare investigated. Specifically, we explore the scenario that particle A hold by\nAlice is in a flat space-time and another particle B by Bob entangled with A is\nin a non-inertial framework. The results show that EPR steering from Alice to\nBob is dramatically destroyed by Unruh effect caused by the acceleration of\nBob. Besides, EPR steering has an asymmetry property, and EPR steering\nasymmetry increases with the growing intensity of Unruh effect, implying that\nthe Unruh effect can bring on EPR steering asymmetry. Furthermore, the reduced\nphysical accessible EPR steering from Alice to Bob is distributed to the\nphysical inaccessible EPR steering (from Alice to anti-Bob or from Bob to\nanti-Bob). Notably, unlike entanglement and quantum discord, only one of EPR\nsteering from Alice to anti-Bob and Bob to anti-Bob experiences a sudden birth\nwith the increase of acceleration parameter, which means that they cannot\nsimultaneously survive. That is, the monogamy relation of EPR steering is still\ntenable in such a scenario. Consequently, we believe that EPR steering could\nalso be served as one of important information resources within the\nlong-distance quantum secure communication under the relativistic framework.\n", "  Toroidal flow alone is generally thought to have important influence on\ntokamak edge pedestal stability, even though theory analysis often predicts\nmerely a weak stabilizing effect of toroidal flow on the edge localized modes\n(ELMs) in experimental parameter regimes. For the first time, we find from\ntwo-fluid MHD calculations that such a stabilization, however, can be\nsignificantly enhanced by increasing the edge plasma density. Our finding\nresolves a long-standing mystery whether or how toroidal rotation can indeed\nhave effective influence on ELMs, and explains why the ELM mitigation and\nsuppression by toroidal rotation are more favorably achieved in higher\ncollisionality regime in recent experiments. The finding suggests a new control\nscheme on modulating toroidal flow stabilization of ELMs with plasma density,\nalong with a new additional constraint on the optimal level of plasma density\nfor the desired edge plasma conditions.\n", "  We study the effect of the nucleon meson cloud on predictions of the Monte\nCarlo Glauber wounded nucleon model for $AA$, $pA$, and $pp$ collisions. From\nthe analysis of the data on the charged multiplicity density in $AA$ collisions\nwe find that the meson-baryon Fock component reduces the required fraction of\nbinary collisions by a factor of $\\sim 2$ for Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}=0.2$ TeV and $\\sim 1.5$ for Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV.\nFor central $AA$ collisions the meson cloud can increase the multiplicity\ndensity by $\\sim 16-18$\\%. We give predictions for the midrapidity charged\nmultiplicity density in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV for the future\nLHC run 2. We find that the meson cloud has a weak effect on the centrality\ndependence of the ellipticity $\\epsilon_2$ in $AA$ collisions. For collisions\nof the deformed uranium nuclei at $\\sqrt{s}=0.2$ TeV we find that the meson\ncloud may improve somewhat agreement with the data on the dependence of the\nelliptic flow on the charged multiplicity for very small centralities defined\nvia the ZDCs signals. We find that the meson cloud may lead to a noticeable\nreduction of $\\epsilon_2$ and the size of the fireball in $pA$ and $pp$\ncollisions.\n", "  Magnonics and magnon spintronics aim at the utilization of spin waves and\nmagnons, their quanta, for the construction of wave-based logic networks via\nthe generation of pure all-magnon spin currents and their interfacing with\nelectrical charge transport. The promise of efficient parallel data processing\nand low power consumption renders this field one of the most promising research\nareas in spintronics. In this context, the process of parallel parametric\namplification, i.e., the conversion of microwave photons into magnons at one\nhalf of the microwave frequency, has proven to be a versatile tool. Its\nbeneficial and unique properties, such as frequency and mode-selectivity, the\npossibility to excite spin waves in a wide wavevector range and the creation of\nphase-correlated wave pairs, render it one of the key methods of spin-wave\ngeneration and amplification.\n  The application of parallel parametric amplification to micro- and\nnanostructures is an important step towards the realization of magnonic\nnetworks. This is motivated not only by the fact that amplifiers are an\nimportant tool for the construction of any extended logic network but also by\nthe unique properties of parallel parametric amplification, such as a\nphase-dependent amplification. Recently, the successful application of parallel\nparametric amplification to metallic microstructures has been reported. It has\nbeen demonstrated that parametric amplification provides an excellent tool to\ngenerate and to amplify spin waves in these systems. In particular, the\namplification greatly benefits from the discreteness of the spin-wave spectra.\nThis opens up new, interesting routes of spin-wave amplification and\nmanipulation. In this Review, we give an overview over the recent developments\nand achievements in this field.\n", "  We consider the scattering of gravitational waves off a Schwarzschild black\nhole in $f(R)$ gravity. We show that the reflection and transmission\ncoefficients for tensor waves are the same as in General Relativity. While the\nscalar waves, which are not present in General Relativity, demonstrate\ninteresting features. The equation that governs these scalar waves can be\nreduced to a Volterra integral equation. Analysis of this equation shows that a\nlarger fraction of these waves are reflected compared to what one obtains for\ntensors. This may provide a novel observational signature for fourth order\ngravity.\n", "  The superconducting current breaking effect at pulsed field magnetization of\nHTS annuli was carefully investigated. It is proposed the simple model for\nqualitative description of this process. In particular, it is shown the\nappearance of a narrow sector of the considerable heating through which the\nmagnetic flux penetrates into the superconducting annuli.\n", "  We study the geometric description of BPS states in supersymmetric theories\nwith eight supercharges in terms of geodesic networks on suitable spectral\ncurves. We lift and extend several constructions of Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke from\ngauge theory to local Calabi-Yau threefolds and related models. The\ndifferential is multi-valued on the covering curve and features a new type of\nlogarithmic singularity in order to account for D0-branes and non-compact\nD4-branes, respectively. We describe local rules for the three-way junctions of\nBPS trajectories relative to a particular framing of the curve. We reproduce\nBPS quivers of local geometries and illustrate the wall-crossing of finite-mass\nbound states in several new examples. We describe first steps toward\nunderstanding the spectrum of framed BPS states in terms of such \"exponential\nnetworks.\"\n", "  The theory of scalar gravity proposed by Nordstr\\\"{o}m, and refined by\nEinstein and Fokker, provides a striking analogy to general relativity. In its\nmodern form, scalar gravity appears as the low-energy effective field theory of\nthe spontaneous breaking of conformal symmetry within a CFT, and is AdS/CFT\ndual to the original Randall-Sundrum I model, but without a UV brane. Scalar\ngravity faithfully exhibits several qualitative features of the cosmological\nconstant problem of standard gravity coupled to quantum matter, and the\nWeinberg no-go theorem can be extended to this case as well. Remarkably, a\nsolution to the scalar gravity cosmological constant problem has been proposed,\nwhere the key is a very small violation of the scalar equivalence principle,\nwhich can be elegantly formulated as a particular type of deformation of the\nCFT. In the dual AdS picture this involves implementing Goldberger-Wise radion\nstabilization where the Goldberger-Wise field is a pseudo-Nambu Goldstone\nboson. In quantum gravity however, global symmetries protecting pNGBs are not\nexpected to be fundamental. We provide a natural six-dimensional gauge theory\norigin for this global symmetry and show that the violation of the equivalence\nprinciple and the size of the vacuum energy seen by scalar gravity can\nnaturally be exponentially small. Our solution may be of interest for study of\nnon-supersymmetric CFTs in the spontaneously broken phase.\n", "  Jet energy loss and single inclusive jet suppression in high-energy heavy-ion\ncollisions are studied within a pQCD parton model that includes both elastic\nand radiative interactions between jet shower and medium partons as they\npropagate through the quark-gluon plasma. The collisional energy loss of jets\nwith a given cone-size is found to be relatively small comparing with the\nradiative energy loss. However the effect of transverse momentum broadening due\nto elastic scattering is significant in the calculation of radiative energy\nloss within the higher-twist formalism. The nuclear modification factors for\nsingle inclusive jets with different cone-sizes are calculated and compared to\nexperimental data as measured by ALICE and ATLAS experiments in Pb+Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV. Results on jet suppression in Pb+Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are also presented.\n", "  Phase coupling between auto-oscillators is central for achieving coherent\nresponses such as synchronization. Here we present an experimental approach to\nprobe it in the case of two dipolarly coupled spin-torque vortex\nnano-oscillators using an external microwave field. By phase-locking one\noscillator to the microwave field, we observe frequency pulling on the second\noscillator. From coupled Thiele equations we show analytically that this\nfrequency pulling results from concerted actions of dipolar and microwave\ncouplings. The analysis allows us to determine the amplitude of dipolar\ncoupling and the phase lag of each oscillator, yielding important information\nfor the implementation of large oscillator networks.\n", "  When quantifying the time spent in the transient of a complex dynamical\nsystem, the fundamental problem is that for a large class of systems the actual\ntime for reaching an attractor is infinite. Common methods for dealing with\nthis problem usually introduce three additional problems: non-invariance,\nphysical interpretation, and discontinuities, calling for carefully designed\nmethods for quantifying transients.\n  In this article, we discuss how the aforementioned problems emerge and\npropose two novel metrics, Regularized Reaching Time ($T_{RR}$) and Area under\nDistance Curve (AUDIC), to solve them, capturing two complementary aspects of\nthe transient dynamics.\n  $T_{RR}$ quantifies the additional time (positive or negative) that a\ntrajectory starting at a chosen initial condition needs to reach the attractor\nafter a reference trajectory has already arrived there. A positive or negative\nvalue means that it arrives by this much earlier or later than the reference.\nBecause $T_{RR}$ is an analysis of return times after shocks, it is a\nsystematic approach to the concept of critical slowing down [1]; hence it is\nnaturally an early-warning signal [2] for bifurcations when central statistics\nover distributions of initial conditions are used.\n  AUDIC is the distance of the trajectory to the attractor integrated over\ntime. Complementary to $T_{RR}$, it measures which trajectories are reluctant,\ni.e. stay away from the attractor for long, or eager to approach it right away.\n  (... shortened for arxiv listing, full abstract in paper ...) New features in\nthese models can be uncovered, including the surprising regularity of the\nRoessler system's basin of attraction even in the regime of a chaotic\nattractor. Additionally, we demonstrate the critical slowing down\ninterpretation by presenting the metrics' sensitivity to prebifurcational\nchange and thus how they act as early-warning signals.\n", "  We consider an alternative cold dark matter candidate, ultralight bosons\n($m>10^{-22}$eV) described by a complex scalar field (SFDM) with global U(1)\nsymmetry, with comoving particle number density conserved after particle\nproduction during standard reheating. We allow for repulsive self-interaction.\nIn a Lambda-SFDM universe, SFDM starts relativistic, evolving from stiff (w=1)\nto radiation-like (w=1/3), becoming nonrelativistic (w=0) at late times. Thus,\na stiff-SFDM-dominated era precedes the familiar radiation-dominated era. SFDM\nparticle mass $m$ and quartic self-interaction strength \\lambda, are therefore\nconstrained by cosmological observables, N_{eff}, the effective number of\nneutrino species during BBN, and z_{eq}, the matter-radiation equality\nredshift. Since the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from\ninflation is amplified during the stiff-SFDM-dominated era, it can also\ncontribute a radiationlike component large enough to affect these observables.\nRemarkably, this amplification makes this SGWB detectable by current GW\nexperiments, e.g., aLIGO/Virgo and LISA, for Lambda-SFDM models satisfying\ncosmological constraints, for a range of reheat temperatures T_{re} and\ncurrently allowed values of tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. For given r and\n$\\lambda/(mc^2)^2$, the marginally-allowed Lambda-SFDM model for each T_{re}\nhas the smallest m that satisfies cosmological constraints. For example, for\nmarginally-allowed models with r=0.01 and\n$\\lambda/(mc^2)^2=10^{-18}$eV$^{-1}$cm$^3$, null detection by the aLIGO O1 run\nexcludes 8.75*10^3<T_{re} (GeV)<1.7*10^5 at 95% confidence, demonstrating that\nGW experiments already place a new kind of cosmological constraint on SFDM. A\nwider parameter range should be accessible to aLIGO/Virgo O5, with potential to\ndetect this signature of Lambda-SFDM. For this same illustrative family,\n3-sigma detection is predicted for 600<T_{re} (GeV)<10^7.\n", "  In the next few years, we are going to probe the low-redshift universe with\nunprecedented accuracy. Among the various fruits that this will bear, it will\ngreatly improve our knowledge of the dynamics of dark energy, though for this\nthere is a strong theoretical preference for a cosmological constant. We assume\nthat dark energy is described by the so-called Effective Field Theory of Dark\nEnergy, which assumes that dark energy is the Goldstone boson of time\ntranslations. Such a formalism makes it easy to ensure that our signatures are\nconsistent with well-established principles of physics. Since most of the\ninformation resides at high wavenumbers, it is important to be able to make\npredictions at the highest wavenumber that is possible. The Effective Field\nTheory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) is a theoretical framework that has\nallowed us to make accurate predictions in the mildly non-linear regime. In\nthis paper, we derive the non-linear equations that extend the EFTofLSS to\ninclude the effect of dark energy both on the matter fields and on the biased\ntracers. For the specific case of clustering quintessence, we then\nperturbatively solve to cubic order the resulting non-linear equations and\nconstruct the one-loop power spectrum of the total density contrast.\n", "  Understanding the structural phase diagram of nano scale SrTiO3 has important\nimplications on the basic physics and applications of the general class of\ntransition metal oxide perovskites. Pressure dependent structural measurements\non monodispersed nanoscale SrTiO3 samples with average diameters of 10 to ~80\nnm were conducted. A robust pressure independent polar structure was detected\nin the 10 nm sample for pressures of up to 13 GPa while a size dependent cubic\nto tetragonal transition occurs (at P = Pc) for larger particle sizes. The\nresults suggest that the growth of ~10 nm STO particles on substrates with\nlarge lattice mismatch will not alter the polar state of the system for a large\nrange of strain values, possibly enabling device use.\n", "  The detection of long-lived radionuclides through ultra-sensitive single atom\ncounting via accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) offers opportunities for\nprecise measurements of neutron capture cross sections, e.g. for nuclear\nastrophysics. The technique represents a truly complementary approach,\ncompletely independent of previous experimental methods. The potential of this\ntechnique is highlighted at the example of the $^{54}$Fe($n, \\gamma$)$^{55}$Fe\nreaction. Following a series of irradiations with neutrons from cold and\nthermal to keV energies, the produced long-lived $^{55}$Fe nuclei\n($t_{1/2}=2.744(9)$ yr) were analyzed at the Vienna Environmental Research\nAccelerator (VERA). A reproducibility of about 1% could be achieved for the\ndetection of $^{55}$Fe, yielding cross section uncertainties of less than 3%.\nThus, the new data can serve as anchor points to time-of-flight experiments. We\nreport significantly improved neutron capture cross sections at thermal energy\n($\\sigma_{th}=2.30\\pm0.07$ b) as well as for a quasi-Maxwellian spectrum of\n$kT=25$ keV ($\\sigma=30.3\\pm1.2$ mb) and for $E_n=481\\pm53$ keV ($\\sigma=\n6.01\\pm0.23$ mb). The new experimental cross sections have been used to deduce\nimproved Maxwellian average cross sections in the temperature regime of the\ncommon $s$-process scenarios. The astrophysical impact is discussed using\nstellar models for low-mass AGB stars.\n", "  We compute the one-loop threshold corrections to the gauge and gravitational\ncouplings for a large class of N=2 non-K\\\"ahler heterotic compactifications\nwith three-form flux, consisting in principal two-torus bundles over K3\nsurfaces. We obtain the results as sums of BPS-states contributions, depending\non the topological data of the bundle. We analyse also the worldsheet\nnon-perturbative corrections coming from instantons wrapping the torus fiber,\nthat are mapped under S-duality to D-instanton corrections in type I flux\ncompactifications.\n", "  In earlier work, we have developed a Kinetic Field Theory (KFT) for\ncosmological structure formation and showed that the non-linear\ndensity-fluctuation power spectrum known from numerical simulations can be\nreproduced quite well even if particle interactions are taken into account to\nfirst order only. Besides approximating gravitational interactions, we had to\ntruncate the initial correlation hierarchy of particle momenta at the second\norder. Here, we substantially simplify KFT. We show that its central object,\nthe free generating functional, can be factorized, taking the full hierarchy of\nmomentum correlations into account. The factors appearing in the generating\nfunctional, which we identify as non-linearly evolved density-fluctuation power\nspectra, have a universal form and can thus be tabulated for fast access in\nperturbation schemes.\n  In this paper, we focus on a complete evaluation of the free generating\nfunctional of KFT, not including particle interactions yet. This implies that\nthe non-linearly evolved power spectra contain a damping term which reflects\nthat structures are being wiped out at late times by free streaming. Once\nparticle interactions will be taken into account, they will compensate this\ndamping. If we suppress this damping in a way suggested by the\nfluctuation-dissipation relations of KFT, our results show that the complete\nhierarchy of initial momentum correlations is responsible for a large part of\nthe characteristic non-linear deformation and the mode transport in the\ndensity-fluctuation power spectrum. Without any adjustable parameters, KFT\naccurately reproduces the scale at which non-linear evolution sets in.\n  Finally, we further develop perturbation theory based on the factorization of\nthe generating functional and propose a diagrammatic scheme for the\nperturbation terms.\n", "  We investigate high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from noble gas clusters\nin a supersonic gas jet. To identify the contribution of harmonic generation\nfrom clusters versus that from gas monomers, we measure the high-order harmonic\noutput over a broad range of the total atomic number density in the jet (from\n3*10^16 cm^{-3} to 3x10^18 cm{-3}) at two different reservoir temperatures (303\nK and 363 K). For the firrst time in the evaluation of the harmonic yield in\nsuch measurements, the variation of the liquid mass fraction, g, versus\npressure and temperature is taken into consideration, which we determine,\nreliably and consistently, to be below 20% within our range of experimental\nparameters. By comparing the measured harmonic yield from a thin jet with the\ncalculated corresponding yield from monomers alone, we find an increased\nemission of the harmonics when the average cluster size is less than 3000.\nUsing g, under the assumption that the emission from monomers and clusters add\nup coherently, we calculate the ratio of the average single-atom response of an\natom within a cluster to that of a monomer and find an enhancement of around 10\nfor very small average cluster size (~200). We do not find any dependence of\nthe cut-off frequency on the composition of the cluster jet. This implies that\nHHG in clusters is based on electrons that return to their parent ions and not\nto neighbouring ions in the cluster. To fully employ the enhanced average\nsingle-atom response found for small average cluster sizes (~200), the nozzle\nproducing the cluster jet must provide a large liquid mass fraction at these\nsmall cluster sizes for increasing the harmonic yield. Moreover, cluster jets\nmay allow for quasi-phase matching, as the higher mass of clusters allows for a\nhigher density contrast in spatially structuring the nonlinear medium.\n", "  The functions of many networked systems in physics, biology or engineering\nrely on a coordinated or synchronized dynamics of its constituents. In power\ngrids for example, all generators must synchronize and run at the same\nfrequency and their phases need to appoximately lock to guarantee a steady\npower flow. Here, we analyze the existence and multitude of such phase-locked\nstates. Focusing on edge and cycle flows instead of the nodal phases we derive\nrigorous results on the existence and number of such states. Generally,\nmultiple phase-locked states coexist in networks with strong edges, long\nelementary cycles and a homogeneous distribution of natural frequencies or\npower injections, respectively. We offer an algorithm to systematically compute\nmultiple phase- locked states and demonstrate some surprising dynamical\nconsequences of multistability.\n", "  We study magnetotransport in a disordered Weyl semimetal taking into account\nlocalization effects exactly. In the vicinity of a Weyl node, a single chiral\nLandau level coexists with a number of conventional non-chiral levels. Disorder\nscattering mixes these topologically different modes leading to peculiar\nlocalization effects. We derive the average conductance as well as the full\ndistribution function of transmission probabilities along the field direction.\nRemarkably, we find that localization of the non-chiral modes is greatly\nenhanced in a strong magnetic field with the typical localization length\nscaling as $1/B$. Technically, we use the non-linear sigma-model formalism with\na topological term describing the chiral states. The problem is solved exactly\nby mapping to an equivalent transfer matrix Hamiltonian.\n", "  A major challenge facing existing sequential Monte-Carlo methods for\nparameter estimation in physics stems from the inability of existing approaches\nto robustly deal with experiments that have different mechanisms that yield the\nresults with equivalent probability. We address this problem here by proposing\na form of particle filtering that clusters the particles that comprise the\nsequential Monte-Carlo approximation to the posterior before applying a\nresampler. Through a new graphical approach to thinking about such models, we\nare able to devise an artificial-intelligence based strategy that automatically\nlearns the shape and number of the clusters in the support of the posterior. We\ndemonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to randomized gap\nestimation and a form of low circuit-depth phase estimation where existing\nmethods from the physics literature either exhibit much worse performance or\neven fail completely.\n", "  Radiatively-driven natural SUSY (RNS) models enjoy electroweak naturalness at\nthe $10\\%$ level while respecting LHC sparticle and Higgs mass constraints.\nGluino and top squark masses can range up to several TeV (with other squarks\neven heavier) but a set of light Higgsinos are required with mass not too far\nabove $m_h\\sim 125$ GeV. Within the RNS framework, gluinos dominantly decay via\n${\\tilde g} \\to t{\\tilde t}_1^{*},\\ \\bar{t}{\\tilde t}_1 \\to t\\bar{t}{\\widetilde\nZ}_{1,2}$ or $t\\bar{b}{\\widetilde W}_1^-+c.c.$, where the decay products of the\nhiggsino-like ${\\widetilde W}_1$ and ${\\widetilde Z}_2$ are very soft. Gluino\npair production is, therefore, signalled by events with up to four hard\n$b$-jets and large ${\\not\\!\\!{E_T}}$. We devise a set of cuts to isolate a\nrelatively pure gluino sample at the (high luminosity) LHC and show that in the\nRNS model with very heavy squarks, the gluino signal will be accessible for\n$m_{{\\tilde g}} < 2400 \\ (2800)$ GeV for an integrated luminosity of 300 (3000)\nfb$^{-1}$. We also show that the measurement of the rate of gluino events in\nthe clean sample mentioned above allows for a determination of $m_{{\\tilde g}}$\nwith a statistical precision of $2.5-5\\%$ (depending on the integrated\nluminosity and the gluino mass) over the range of gluino masses where a\n$5\\sigma$ discovery is possible at the LHC.\n", "  Very high multiplicity, spherically-symmetric distributions of soft\nparticles, with $p_T$ ~ few hundred MeV, may be a signature of strongly-coupled\nhidden valleys that exhibit long, efficient showering windows. With traditional\ntriggers, such \"soft bomb\" events closely resemble pile-up and are therefore\nonly recorded with minimum bias triggers at a very low efficiency. We\ndemonstrate a proof-of-concept for a high-level triggering strategy that\nefficiently separates soft bombs from pile-up by searching for a \"belt of\nfire\": A high density band of hits on the innermost layer of the tracker.\nSeeding our proposed high-level trigger with existing jet, missing transverse\nenergy or lepton hardware-level triggers, we show that net trigger efficiencies\nof order 10% are possible for bombs of mass several hundred GeV. We also\nconsider the special case that soft bombs are the result of an exotic decay of\nthe 125 GeV Higgs. The fiducial rate for \"Higgs bombs\" triggered in this manner\nis marginally higher than the rate achievable by triggering directly on a hard\nmuon from associated Higgs production.\n", "  We study heavy quarkonium within the light-front Hamiltonian formalism. Our\neffective Hamiltonian is based on the holographic QCD confining potential and\nthe one-gluon exchange interaction with a running coupling. The obtained\nspectra are compared with experimental measurements. We present a set of\nlight-front wave functions, which exhibit rich structure and are consistent\nwith the nonrelativistic picture. Finally, we use the wave functions to compute\nthe charge and mass radii.\n", "  We examine holographic theories where Lifshitz symmetry is broken with\nspatial anisotropy. In particular, we focus on the conditions imposed by the\nnull energy condition, and demonstrate that it is possible to have unusual\nanisotropic fixed points where a subset of the spatial dimensions have negative\nscaling exponents. We also construct interpolating solutions between UV and IR\nfixed points and show that there is essentially no restriction placed on the\nendpoints of the flow once anisotropic scaling is allowed. As an example, we\ndemonstrate a flow from AdS to AdS with $c_{IR}>c_{UV}$ that is allowed by the\nnull energy condition since it proceeds through an intermediate\nLorentz-violating region. Finally, we examine the holographic Green's function\nin anisotropic Lifshitz spacetimes.\n", "  We elaborate on the construction of a prequantum 2-Hilbert space from a\nbundle gerbe over a 2-plectic manifold, providing the first steps in a program\nof higher geometric quantisation of closed strings in flux compactifications\nand of M5-branes in C-fields. We review in detail the construction of the\n2-category of bundle gerbes, and introduce the higher geometrical structures\nnecessary to turn their categories of sections into 2-Hilbert spaces. We work\nout several explicit examples of 2-Hilbert spaces in the context of closed\nstrings and M5-branes on flat space. We also work out the prequantum 2-Hilbert\nspace associated to an M-theory lift of closed strings described by an\nasymmetric cyclic orbifold of the SU(2) WZW model, providing an example of\nsections of a torsion gerbe on a curved background. We describe the dimensional\nreduction of M-theory to string theory in these settings as a map from\n2-isomorphism classes of sections of bundle gerbes to sections of corresponding\nline bundles, which is compatible with the respective monoidal structures and\nmodule actions.\n", "  In this letter we bring together the physics of preheating, following a\nperiod of inflation, and the dynamics of non-topological solitons, namely\noscillons. We show that the oscillating condensate that makes up an oscillon\ncan be an efficient engine for producing heavy fermions, just as a homogeneous\ncondensate is known for doing the same. This then allows heavy fermions to be\nproduced when the energy scale of the Universe has dropped below the scale\nnaturally associated to the fermions.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a new unified first order hyperbolic model of\nNewtonian continuum mechanics coupled with electro-dynamics. The model is able\nto describe the behavior of moving elasto-plastic dielectric solids as well as\nviscous and inviscid fluids in the presence of electro-magnetic fields. It is\nactually a very peculiar feature of the proposed PDE system that viscous fluids\nare treated just as a special case of elasto-plastic solids. This is achieved\nby introducing a strain relaxation mechanism in the evolution equations of the\ndistortion matrix. The model also contains a hyperbolic formulation of heat\nconduction as well as a dissipative source term in the evolution equations for\nthe electric field given by Ohm's law. Via formal asymptotic analysis we show\nthat in the stiff limit, the governing first order hyperbolic PDE system with\nrelaxation source terms tends asymptotically to the well-known viscous and\nresistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The governing PDE system is\nsymmetric hyperbolic and satisfies the first and second principle of\nthermodynamics, hence it belongs to the so-called class of symmetric hyperbolic\nthermodynamically compatible systems (HTC). An important feature of the\nproposed model is that the propagation speeds of all physical processes,\nincluding dissipative processes, are finite. The model is discretized using\nhigh order accurate ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes\nwith a posteriori subcell finite volume limiter and using high order ADER-WENO\nfinite volume schemes. We show numerical test problems that explore a rather\nlarge parameter space of the model ranging from ideal MHD, viscous and\nresistive MHD over pure electro-dynamics to moving dielectric elastic solids in\na magnetic field.\n", "  A perfectly reflecting accelerating boundary produces thermal emission to an\nobserver at $\\mathscr{I}_L^+$ and a finite amount of energy to an observer at\n$\\mathscr{I}_R^+$ by asymptotically traveling to the speed of light without an\nacceleration horizon.\n", "  Measurement outcomes of a quantum state can be genuinely random\n(unpredictable) according to the basic laws of quantum mechanics. The\nHeisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation puts constrains on the accuracy of\ntwo noncommuting observables. The existing uncertainty relations adopt variance\nor entropic measures, which are functions of observed outcome distributions, to\nquantify the uncertainty. According to recent studies of quantum coherence,\nsuch uncertainty measures contain both classical (predictable) and quantum\n(unpredictable) components. In order to extract out the quantum effects, we\ndefine quantum uncertainty to be the coherence of the state on the measurement\nbasis. We discover a quantum uncertainty relation of coherence between two\nmeasurement non-commuting bases. Furthermore, we analytically derive the\nquantum uncertainty relation for the qubit case with three widely adopted\ncoherence measures, the relative entropy using coherence, the coherence of\nformation, and the $l_1$ norm of coherence.\n", "  The Juno mission will measure Jupiter's magnetic field with unprecedented\nprecision and provide a wealth of additional data that will allow to constrain\nthe planet's interior structure and dynamics. Here we analyse 66 numerical\nsimulations in order to explore the sensitivity of the dynamo-generated\nmagnetic field to the planets interior properties. The degree l=4 field model\nVIP4 and up-to-date interior models based on ab initio simulations serve as\nbenchmarks. Our results suggest that VIP4-like magnetic fields can be found for\na number of different models. We find that whether we assume an ideal gas or\nuse the more realistic interior model based on ab initio simulations makes no\ndifference. However, two other factors are important. Low Rayleigh number leads\nto strong axial dipole contribution while the axial dipole dominance is lost\nwhen the convective driving is too strong. The required intermediate range that\nyields Jupiter-like magnetic fields depends on the other system properties. The\nsecond factor is the convective magnetic Reynolds number profile Rmc(r), a\nproduct of the non-axisymmetric flow velocity and electrical conductivity. We\nfind that the depth where Rmc exceeds about 50 is a good proxy for the top of\nthe dynamo region. When the dynamo region sits too deep, the axial dipole is\nonce more too dominant due to geometric reasons. We extrapolated our results to\nJupiter and the result suggests that the Jovian dynamo extends to 95% of the\nplanetary radius.\n  The zonal flows in our simulations are dominated by an equatorial jet largely\nconfined to the molecular layer. Where the jet reaches down to higher\nelectrical conductivities, it is gives rise to a secondary alpha-Omega dynamo\nthat modifies the dipole-dominated field produced deeper in the planet. This\nsecondary dynamo can lead to strong magnetic field patches at low latitudes\nthat seem compatible with the VIP4 model.\n", "  We utilise bosonic Fock spaces, considered as Virasoro modules, to make free\nfield realisations of the so-called staggered modules of two-dimensional\nlogarithmic conformal field theories. A general formula for the\n$\\beta$-invariant of a staggered Fock module is derived, and found to agree\nwith values previously known in the literature. In this way a large class of\nstaggered modules is produced; one which provides an explicit free-field\nconstruction for many of those previously studied. We show how these modules\ncan arise algebraically by including the modes of weight-$0$ fields into the\nalgebra.\n", "  Type II integrable defects with more than one degree of freedom at the defect\nare investigated. A condition on the form of the Lagrangian for such defects is\nfound which ensures the existence of a conserved momentum in the presence of\nthe defect. In addition it is shown that for any Lagrangian satisfying this\ncondition, the defect equations of motion, when taken to hold everywhere, can\nbe extended to give a B\\\"{a}cklund transformation between the bulk theories on\neither side of the defect. This strongly suggests that such systems are\nintegrable. Momentum conserving defects and B\\\"{a}cklund transformations for\naffine Toda field theories based on the $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$ and $D_n$ series of\nLie algebras are found. The defect associated with the $D_4$ affine Toda field\ntheory is examined in more detail. In particular classical time delays for\nsolitons passing through the defect are calculated.\n", "  We present the second catalog of flaring gamma-ray sources (2FAV) detected\nwith the Fermi All-sky Variability Analysis (FAVA), a tool that blindly\nsearches for transients over the entire sky observed by the Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) on board the \\textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope. With\nrespect to the first FAVA catalog, this catalog benefits from a larger data\nset, the latest LAT data release (Pass 8), as well as from an improved analysis\nthat includes likelihood techniques for a more precise localization of the\ntransients. Applying this analysis on the first 7.4 years of \\textit{Fermi}\nobservations, and in two separate energy bands 0.1$-$0.8 GeV and 0.8$-$300 GeV,\na total of 4547 flares has been detected with a significance greater than\n$6\\sigma$ (before trials), on the time scale of one week. Through spatial\nclustering of these flares, 518 variable gamma-ray sources are identified.\nLikely counterparts, based on positional coincidence, have been found for 441\nsources, mostly among the blazar class of active galactic nuclei. For 77 2FAV\nsources, no likely gamma-ray counterpart has been found. For each source in the\ncatalog, we provide the time, location, and spectrum of each flaring episode.\nStudying the spectra of the flares, we observe a harder-when-brighter behavior\nfor flares associated with blazars, with the exception of BL Lac flares\ndetected in the low-energy band. The photon indexes of the flares are never\nsignificantly smaller than 1.5. For a leptonic model, and under the assumption\nof isotropy, this limit suggests that the spectrum of the freshly accelerated\nelectrons is never harder than $p\\sim$2.\n", "  With a combination of simple analytical arguments and extensive numerical\nsimulations, we theoretically propose a Josephson junction with $n+1$\nsuperconductors where the current-phase relation can be toggled in situ between\na $\\sin(\\delta\\varphi)$ and $\\sin(\\delta\\varphi/n)$ shape using an applied\nmagnetic field. Focusing in particular on the case $n=2$, we show that by using\nrealistic system parameters such as unequal interface transparencies, the\n$\\sin(\\delta\\varphi/2)$-shaped solution retains its $2\\pi$-periodicity due to\ndiscontinuities at $\\delta\\varphi = \\pm \\pi$. Moreover, we demonstrate that as\none toggles between the $\\sin(\\delta\\varphi)$- and\n$\\sin(\\delta\\varphi/2)$-shaped solutions, the system acts as an on--off switch,\nand can acheive more than two orders of magnitude difference between the\nsupercurrent in the on and off states. Finally, we argue that the same approach\ncan be generalized to switchable $\\sin(\\delta\\varphi/n)$ junctions for\narbitrary integers~$n$, which we motivate by analytically solving the Josephson\nequations for double- and triple-barrier junctions.\n", "  Understanding the interactions among nodes in a complex network is of great\nimportance, since they disclose how these nodes are cooperatively supporting\nthe functioning of the network. Scientists have developed numerous methods to\nuncover the underlying adjacent physical connectivity based on measurements of\nfunctional quantities of the nodes states. Often, the physical connectivity,\nthe adjacency matrix, is available. Yet, little is known about how this\nadjacent connectivity impacts on the \"hidden\" flows being exchanged between any\ntwo arbitrary nodes, after travelling longer non-adjacent paths. In this\nLetter, we show that hidden physical flows in conservative flow networks, a\nquantity that is usually inaccessible to measurements, can be determined by the\ninterchange of physical flows between any pair of adjacent nodes. Our approach\napplies to steady or dynamic state of either linear or non-linear complex\nnetworks that can be modelled by conservative flow networks, such as gas supply\nnetworks, water supply networks and power grids.\n", "  In this paper we show and discuss the use of a versatile interaction\npotential approach coupled with an immersed boundary method to simulate a\nvariety of flows involving deformable bodies. In particular, we focus on two\nkinds of problems, namely (i) deformation of liquid-liquid interfaces and (ii)\nflow in the left ventricle of the heart with either a mechanical or a natural\nvalve. Both examples have in common the two-way interaction of the flow with a\ndeformable interface or a membrane. The interaction potential approach (de\nTullio & Pascazio, Jou. Comp. Phys., 2016; Tanaka, Wada and Nakamura,\nComputational Biomechanics, 2016) with minor modifications can be used to\ncapture the deformation dynamics in both classes of problems. We show that the\napproach can be used to replicate the deformation dynamics of liquid-liquid\ninterfaces through the use of ad-hoc elastic constants. The results from our\nsimulations agree very well with previous studies on the deformation of drops\nin standard flow configurations such as deforming drop in a shear flow or a\ncross flow. We show that the same potential approach can also be used to study\nthe flow in the left ventricle of the heart. The flow imposed into the\nventricle interacts dynamically with the mitral valve (mechanical or natural)\nand the ventricle which are simulated using the same model. Results from these\nsimulations are compared with ad- hoc in-house experimental measurements.\nFinally, a parallelisation scheme is presented, as parallelisation is\nunavoidable when studying large scale problems involving several thousands of\nsimultaneously deforming bodies on hundreds of distributed memory computing\nprocessors.\n", "  In present analysis we complete search for a dark matter signal with the\nBaikal neutrino telescope NT200 from potential sources in the sky. We use five\nyears of data and look for neutrinos from dark matter annihilations in the\ndwarfs spheroidal galaxies in the Southern hemisphere and the Large Magellanic\nCloud known as the largest and close satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. We do\nnot find any excess in observed data over expected background from the\natmospheric neutrinos towards the LMC or any of tested 22 dwarfs. We perform a\njoint likelihood analysis on the sample of five selected dwarfs and found a\nconcordance of the data with null hypothesis of the background-only\nobservation. We derive 90% CL upper limits on the cross section of annihilating\ndark matter particles of mass between 30 GeV and 10 TeV into several channels\nboth in our combined analysis of the dwarfs and in a particular analysis\ntowards the LMC.\n", "  We study a proposal of generating macroscopic continuous-variable\nentanglement with two coupled waveguides respectively carrying optical damping\nand optical gain. Moreover, a squeezing element is added into one or both\nwaveguides. We show that quantum noise effect existing in the process is\nessential to the degree of the generated entanglement. It will totally\neliminate the entanglement in the setup of adding the squeezing element into\nthe waveguide filled with optical damping material, but will not completely\ndamp the entanglement to zero in the other configurations of having the\nsqueezing element in the gain medium or in both gain and damping medium. The\ndegree of the generated continuous-variable entanglement is irrelevant to the\nintensities of the input light in coherent states. Moreover, the relations\nbetween the entanglement and system parameters are illustrated in terms of the\ndynamical evolutions of the created continuous-variable entanglement.\n", "  The analytic energy gradients with respect to nuclear motion are derived for\nnatural orbital functional (NOF) theory. The resulting equations do not require\nto resort to linear-response theory, so the computation of NOF energy gradients\nis analogous to gradient calculations at the Hartree-Fock level of theory. The\nstructures of 15 spin-compensated systems, composed by first- and second-row\natoms, are optimized employing the conjugate gradient algorithm. As\nfunctionals, two orbital-pairing approaches were used, namely, the fifth and\nsixth Piris NOFs (PNOF5 and PNOF6). For the latter, the obtained equilibrium\ngeometries are compared with coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD)\ncalculations and accurate empirical data.\n", "  We present a new method for stochastic shape optimisation of engineering\nstructures. The method generalises an existing deterministic scheme, in which\nthe structure is represented and evolved by a level-set method coupled with\nmathematical programming. The stochastic element of the algorithm is built on\nthe methods of statistical mechanics and is designed so that the system\nexplores a Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of structures. In non-convex\noptimisation problems, the deterministic algorithm can get trapped in local\noptima: the stochastic generalisation enables sampling of multiple local\noptima, which aids the search for the globally-optimal structure. The method is\ndemonstrated for several simple geometrical problems, and a proof-of-principle\ncalculation is shown for a simple engineering structure.\n", "  We consider perturbative quantum field theory in the causal framework. Gauge\ninvariance is, in this framework, an identity involving chronological products\nof the interaction Lagrangian; it express the fact that the scattering matrix\nmust leave invariant the sub-space of physical states. We are interested in\ngeneralizations of such identity involving Wick sub-monomials of the\ninteraction Lagrangian. The analysis can be performed by direct computation in\nthe lower orders of perturbation theory; guided by these computations we\nconjecture a generalization for arbitrary orders.\n", "  Efimov physics is a universal phenomenon arising in quantum three-body\nsystems. For systems with resonant two-body interactions, Efimov predicted an\ninfinite series of three-body bound states with geometric scaling symmetry.\nThese Efimov states were first observed in cold Cs atoms and have since been\nreported in a variety of atomic systems. While theories predict non-universal\nbehavior for narrow Feshbach resonances, experiments on Efimov resonances are\nso far consistent with predictions based on universal theories. Here we\ndirectly compare the Efimov spectra in a $^6$Li-$^{133}$Cs mixture near two\nFeshbach resonances which are very different in their resonance strengths but\notherwise almost identical. Our result shows a clear dependence of the Efimov\nresonance positions on Feshbach resonance strength and a clear departure from\nthe universal prediction for the narrow Feshbach resonance.\n", "  The properties of nuclear matter are studied using state-of-the-art\nnucleon-nucleon forces up to fifth order in chiral effective field theory. The\nequations of state of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter are\ncalculated in the framework of the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. We discuss in\ndetail the convergence pattern of the chiral expansion and the regulator\ndependence of the calculated equations of state and provide an estimation of\nthe truncation uncertainty. For all employed values of the regulator, the\nfifth-order chiral two-nucleon potential is found to generate nuclear\nsaturation properties similar to the available phenomenological high precision\npotentials. We also extract the symmetry energy of nuclear matter, which is\nshown to be quite robust with respect to the chiral order and the value of the\nregulator.\n", "  We consider a family of quantum spin systems which includes as special cases\nthe ferromagnetic XY model and ferromagnetic Ising model on any graph, with or\nwithout a transverse magnetic field. We prove that the partition function of\nany model in this family can be efficiently approximated to a given relative\nerror E using a classical randomized algorithm with runtime polynomial in 1/E,\nsystem size, and inverse temperature. As a consequence we obtain a polynomial\ntime algorithm which approximates the free energy or ground energy to a given\nadditive error. We first show how to approximate the partition function by the\nperfect matching sum of a finite graph with positive edge weights. Although the\nperfect matching sum is not known to be efficiently approximable in general,\nthe graphs obtained by our method have a special structure which facilitates\nefficient approximation via a randomized algorithm due to Jerrum and Sinclair.\n", "  We study a simple micro-mechanical device that does not lose its snap-through\nbehavior in an environment dominated by fluctuations. The main idea is to have\nseveral degrees of freedom that can cooperatively resist the de-synchronizing\neffect of random perturbations. As an inspiration we use the power stroke\nmachinery of skeletal muscles, which ensures at sub-micron scales and finite\ntemperatures a swift recovery of an abruptly applied slack. In addition to\nhypersensitive response at finite temperatures, our prototypical Brownian snap\nspring also exhibits criticality at special values of parameters which is\nanother potentially interesting property for micro-scale engineering\napplications.\n", "  We present the first ever AdS/CFT calculation of $\\hat{q}$ for a light quark\njet as a function of position or, equivalently, time. Our result does not\nsuffer from the gamma factor blow up of the usual time-independent AdS/CFT\nheavy quark setup and is qualitatively similar to, but differs by\n$\\sim\\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor from, the light flavor result of Liu, Rajagopal,\nand Wiedemann. Our findings can be immediately implemented into any\n$\\hat{q}$-based energy loss model.\n  Our $\\hat{q}$ derivation relies on our calculation of the average distance\nsquared, $s^2(t)$, travelled by the endpoint of a string falling in an\nAdS$_3$-Schwarzschild spacetime. The early time behavior is ballistic,\n$s^2(t)\\sim t^2$, but the late time behavior is the usual diffusive Brownian\nmotion, $s^2(t)\\sim t$. These late time dynamics are universal and depend only\non the near-horizon physics, which allows us to generalize our results to\narbitrary dimensions and thus make contact with the physics explored by RHIC\nand LHC.\n  Additionally, we find that AdS/CFT predicts angular ordering for radiation in\nmedium, just as in vacuum, and in contradistinction to weak-coupling, with its\nanti-angular ordering prediction. Finally, our results also imply, sensibly,\nthat AdS/CFT predicts a smooth interpolation between the angular correlations\nof open heavy flavor and light flavor observables.\n", "  In order to explore the nature of collective modes in weakly bound nuclei, we\nhave investigated deformation effects and surface flow patterns of isovector\ndipole modes in a shape-coexisting nucleus $^{40}$Mg. The calculations were\ndone in a fully self-consistent continuum finite-amplitude Quasiparticle Random\nPhase Approximation (QRPA) in a large deformed spatial mesh. An unexpected\nresult of pygmy and giant dipole modes having disproportionate deformation\nsplittings in strength functions was obtained. Furthermore, the transition\ncurrent densities demonstrate that the long-sought core-halo oscillation in\npygmy resonances is collective and compressional, corresponding to the lowest\nexcitation energy and the simplest quantum flow topology. Our calculations show\nthat surface flow patterns become more complicated as excitation energies\nincrease.\n", "  Aspects of black hole thermodynamics and information loss can be derived as a\nconsequence of Virasoro symmetry. To bolster the connection between Virasoro\nconformal blocks and AdS$_3$ quantum gravity, we study sl$(2)$ Chern-Simons\nWilson line networks and revisit the idea that they compute a variety of\nCFT$_2$ observables, including Virasoro OPE blocks, exactly. We verify this in\nthe semiclassical large central charge limit and to low orders in a\nperturbative $1/c$ expansion.\n  Wilson lines connecting the boundary to points in the bulk play a natural\nrole in bulk reconstruction. Because quantum gravity in AdS$_3$ is rigidly\nfixed by Virasoro symmetry, we argue that sl$(2)$ Wilson lines provide building\nblocks for background independent bulk reconstruction. In particular, we show\nexplicitly that they automatically compute the uniformizing coordinates\nappropriate to any background state.\n", "  We investigate the ability of an antineutrino detector to determine the fuel\ntype of a reactor. A hypothetical 5t antineutrino detector is placed 25m from\nthe core and measures the spectral shape and rate of antineutrinos emitted by\nfission fragments in the core for a number of 90 day periods. Our results\nindicate that four major fuel types can be differentiated from the variation of\nfission fractions over the irradiation time with a true positive probability of\ndetection at 95%. In addition, we demonstrate that antineutrinos can identify\nthe burn-up at which weapons-grade mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel would be reduced to\nreactor-grade MOX on average, providing assurance that plutonium disposition\ngoals are met. In addition, we investigate removal scenarios where plutonium is\npurposefully diverted from a mixture of MOX and low-enriched uranium (LEU)\nfuel. Finally, we discuss how our analysis is impacted by a spectral distortion\naround 6MeV observed in the antineutrino spectrum measured from commercial\npower reactors.\n", "  For $\\nu\\in[0, 1]$ let $D^\\nu$ be the distinguished self-adjoint realisation\nof the three-dimensional Coulomb-Dirac operator $-\\mathrm\ni\\boldsymbol\\alpha\\cdot\\nabla -\\nu|\\cdot|^{-1}$. For $\\nu\\in[0, 1)$ we prove\nthe lower bound of the form $|D^\\nu| \\geqslant C_\\nu\\sqrt{-\\Delta}$, where\n$C_\\nu$ is found explicitly and is better then in all previous works on the\ntopic. In the critical case $\\nu =1$ we prove that for every $\\lambda\\in [0,\n1)$ there exists $K_\\lambda >0$ such that the estimate $|D^{1}| \\geqslant\nK_\\lambda a^{\\lambda -1}(-\\Delta)^{\\lambda/2} -a^{-1}$ holds for all $a >0$. As\napplications we extend the range of coupling constants in the proof of the\nstability of the relativistic electron-positron field and obtain\nCwickel-Lieb-Rozenblum and Lieb-Thirring type estimates on the negative\neigenvalues of perturbed projected massless Coulomb-Dirac operators in the\nFurry picture. We also study the existence of a virtual level at zero for such\nprojected operators.\n", "  In an effort to challenge the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics,\nKarl Popper proposed an experiment involving spatially separated entangled\nparticles. In this experiment, one of the particles passes through a very\nnarrow slit, and thereby its position becomes well-defined. This particle\ntherefore diffracts into a large divergence angle; this effect can be\nunderstood as a consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Popper\nfurther argued that its entangled partner would become comparably localized in\nposition, and that, according to his understanding of the Copenhagen\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics, the \\qo{mere knowledge} of the position of\nthis particle would cause it also to diffract into a large divergence angle.\nPopper recognized that such behaviour could violate the principle of causality\nin that the slit could be removed and the partner particle would be expected to\nrespond instantaneously. Popper thus concluded that it was most likely the case\nthat in an actual experiment the partner photon would not undergo increased\ndiffractive spreading and thus that the Copenhagen interpretation is incorrect.\nHere, we report and analyze the results of an implementation of Popper's\nproposal. We find that the partner beam does not undergo increased diffractive\nspreading. Our work resolves many of the open questions involving Popper's\nproposal, and it provides further insight into the nature of entanglement and\nits relation to the uncertainty principle of correlated particles.\n", "  The Standard Quantum Limit in continuous monitoring of a system is given by\nthe trade-off of shot noise and back-action noise. In gravitational-wave\ndetectors, such as Advanced LIGO, both contributions can simultaneously be\nsqueezed in a broad frequency band by injecting a spectrum of squeezed vacuum\nstates with a frequency-dependent squeeze angle. This approach requires setting\nup an additional long base-line, low-loss filter cavity in a vacuum system at\nthe detector's site. Here, we show that the need for such a filter cavity can\nbe eliminated, by exploiting EPR-entangled signal and idler beams. By\nharnessing their mutual quantum correlations and the difference in the way each\nbeam propagates in the interferometer, we can engineer the input signal beam to\nhave the appropriate frequency dependent conditional squeezing once the\nout-going idler beam is detected. Our proposal is appropriate for all future\ngravitational-wave detectors for achieving sensitivities beyond the Standard\nQuantum Limit.\n", "  It is known that placing a mechanical oscillator in a superposition of\ncoherent states allows, in theory, a measurement of a linear force whose\nsensitivity increases with the amplitude of the mechanical oscillations, a\nuniquely quantum effect. Further, entangled versions of these states across a\nnetwork of $n$ mechanical oscillators enables a measurement whose sensitivity\nincreases linearly with $n$, thus improving over the classical scaling by\n$\\sqrt{n}$. One of the key challenges in exploiting this effect is processing\nthe signal so that it can be readily measured; linear processing is\ninsufficient. Here we show that a Kerr oscillator will not only create the\nnecessary states, but also perform the required processing, transforming the\nquantum phase imprinted by the force signal into a shift in amplitude\nmeasurable with homodyne detection. This allows us to design a relatively\nsimple quantum electro-mechanical circuit that can demonstrate the core quantum\neffect at the heart of this scheme, amplitude-dependent force sensitivity. We\nderive analytic expressions for the performance of the circuit, including\nthermal mechanical noise and photon loss. We discuss the experimental\nchallenges in implementing the scheme with near-term technology.\n", "  In Oste and Van der Jeugt, SIGMA, 12 (2016) we classified all pairs of\nrecurrence relations in which two (dual) Hahn polynomials with different\nparameters appear. Such pairs are referred to as (dual) Hahn doubles, and the\nsame technique was then applied to obtain all Racah doubles. We now consider a\nspecial case concerning the doubles related to Racah polynomials. This gives\nrise to an interesting class of two-diagonal matrices with closed form\nexpressions for the eigenvalues. Just as it was the case for (dual) Hahn\ndoubles, the resulting two-diagonal matrix can be used to construct a finite\noscillator model. We discuss some properties of this oscillator model, give its\n(discrete) position wavefunctions explicitly, and illustrate their behaviour by\nmeans of some plots.\n", "  Spherical tokamak plasmas are typically overdense and thus inaccessible to\nexternally-injected microwaves in the electron cyclotron range. The\nelectrostatic electron Bernstein wave (EBW), however, provides a method to\naccess the plasma core for heating and diagnostic purposes. Understanding the\ndetails of the coupling process to electromagnetic waves is thus important both\nfor the interpretation of microwave diagnostic data and for assessing the\nfeasibility of EBW heating and current drive. While the coupling is reasonably\nwell-understood in the linear regime, nonlinear physics arising from high input\npower has not been previously quantified. To tackle this problem, we have\nperformed one- and two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations\nof the two possible coupling mechanisms, namely X-B and O-X-B mode conversion.\nWe find that the ion dynamics has a profound effect on the field structure in\nthe nonlinear regime, as high amplitude short-scale oscillations of the\nlongitudinal electric field are excited in the region below the high-density\ncut-off prior to the arrival of the EBW. We identify this effect as the\ninstability of the X wave with respect to resonant scattering into an EBW and a\nlower-hybrid wave. We calculate the instability rate analytically and find this\nbasic theory to be in reasonable agreement with our simulation results.\n", "  We discuss electric dipole moments (EDMs) in the framework of CP-violating\nnatural supersymmetry (SUSY). Recent experimental results have significantly\ntightened constraints on the EDMs of electrons and of mercury, and substantial\nfurther progress is expected in the near future. We assess how these results\nconstrain the parameter space of natural SUSY. In addition to our discussion of\nSUSY, we provide a set of general formulas for two-loop fermion EDMs, which can\nbe applied to a wide range of models of new physics. In the SUSY context, the\ntwo-loop effects of stops and charginos respectively constrain the phases of\n$A_t \\mu$ and $M_2 \\mu$ to be small in the natural part of parameter space. If\nthe Higgs mass is lifted to 125 GeV by a new tree-level superpotential\ninteraction and soft term with CP-violating phases, significant EDMs can arise\nfrom the two-loop effects of $W$ bosons and tops. We compare the bounds arising\nfrom EDMs to those from other probes of new physics including colliders, $b \\to\ns \\gamma$, and dark matter searches. Importantly, improvements in reach not\nonly constrain higher masses, but require the phases to be significantly\nsmaller in the natural parameter space at low mass. The required smallness of\nphases sharpens the CP problem of natural SUSY model building.\n", "  In this paper we consider $\\phi^4$ theory in $4-\\epsilon$ dimensions at the\nWilson-Fisher fixed point where the theory becomes conformal. We extend the\nmethod in arXiv:1505.00963 for calculating the leading order term in the\nanomalous dimensions of some operators with spin. This method involves mostly\nsymmetry arguments and reduces the process for calculating anomalous dimensions\nto some Wick contractions in the corresponding free theory. We apply this\nmethod in the case of operators with two and three fields whose twist is equal\nto the number of fields they contain, and we rederive known results for their\nanomalous dimensions. We also calculate the leading term in the anomalous\ndimensions of operators with spin two and three. In addition, we find\nexpressions for the primary operators of the free theory, for arbitrary spin\nand number of fields, whose twist remains equal to the number of fields.\n", "  Nowadays, modern electron microscopes deliver images at atomic scale. The\nprecise atomic structure encodes information about material properties. Thus,\nan important ingredient in the image analysis is to locate the centers of the\natoms shown in micrographs as precisely as possible. Here, we consider scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy (STEM), which acquires data in a rastering\npattern, pixel by pixel. Due to this rastering combined with the magnification\nto atomic scale, movements of the specimen even at the nanometer scale lead to\nrandom image distortions that make precise atom localization difficult. Given a\nseries of STEM images, we derive a Bayesian method that jointly estimates the\ndistortion in each image and reconstructs the underlying atomic grid of the\nmaterial by fitting the atom bumps with suitable bump functions. The resulting\nhighly non-convex minimization problems are solved numerically with a trust\nregion approach. Well-posedness of the reconstruction method and the model\nbehavior for faster and faster rastering are investigated using variational\ntechniques. The performance of the method is finally evaluated on both\nsynthetic and real experimental data.\n", "  We demonstrate that the high energy nonrelativistic asymptotic for the\nphotoionization cross section in a central field $V(r)$ can be expressed in\nterms of the asymptotic of the Fourier transform $V(p)$ of the field. We show\nthat the cross sections drop in the same way for the fields with the Coulomb\nshort distance behavior. The character of the cross sections energy behavior is\nrelated to the analytical properties of the function $V(r)$. The cross sections\nexhibit power drop for the potentials which have singularities an the real\naxis. They suffer the exponential drop if $V(r)$ has singularities in the\ncomplex plane.\n", "  We derive a formula for the entanglement entropy of two regions in momentum\nspace that is generated by the scattering of weakly interacting scalar\nparticles. We discuss an example where weak interactions entangle momentum\nscales above and below an infrared cutoff.\n", "  For any 4d N=2 SCFT, there is a subsector described by a 2d chiral algebra.\nThe vacuum character of the chiral algebra reproduces the Schur index of the\ncorresponding 4d theory. The Macdonald index counts the same set of operators\nas the Schur index, but the former has one more fugacity than the latter. We\nconjecture a prescription to obtain the Macdonald index from the chiral\nalgebra. The vacuum module admits a filtration, from which we construct an\nassociated graded vector space. From this grading, we conjecture a notion of\nrefined character for the vacuum module of a chiral algebra, which reproduces\nthe Macdonald index. We test this prescription for the Argyres-Douglas theories\nof type $(A_1, A_{2n})$ and $(A_1, D_{2n+1})$ where the chiral algebras are\ngiven by Virasoro and su(2) affine Kac-Moody algebra. When the chiral algebra\nhas more than one family of generators, our prescription requires a knowledge\nof the generators from the 4d.\n", "  The electronic states at graphene-SiO$_2$ interface and their inhomogeneity\nwas investigated using the back-gate-voltage dependence of local tunnel spectra\nacquired with a scanning tunneling microscope. The conductance spectra show\ntwo, or occasionally three, minima that evolve along the bias-voltage axis with\nthe back gate voltage. This evolution is modeled using tip-gating and interface\nstates. The energy dependent interface states' density, $D_{it}(E)$, required\nto model the back-gate evolution of the minima, is found to have significant\ninhomogeneity in its energy-width. A broad $D_{it}(E)$ leads to an effect\nsimilar to a reduction in the Fermi velocity while the narrow $D_{it}(E)$ leads\nto the pinning of the Fermi energy close to the Dirac point, as observed in\nsome places, due to enhanced screening of the gate electric field by the narrow\n$D_{it}(E)$\n", "  We report occurrence of large magnetoresistance in lightly doped\nantiferromagnetic paraelectric EuTiO3. Reports of magnetoresistance in\nrare-earth titanates (RTiO3 oxides) are very scarce because they are highly\ninsulating at low temperatures. EuTiO3 is an insulator at 2.5 K and 1% La3+\nsubstitution for Eu2+ lowers the resistivity over five orders of magnitude at\n2.5 K. It is shown that Eu0.99La0.01TiO3 which is antiferromagnetic below T=\n5.43 K shows large magnetoresistance over a wide temperature. At 2.5 K,\nmagnetoresistance is -42 % for H = 6 kOe and it increases to -75 % for H = 7 T.\nEven at 50 K which is ten times higher than Neel temperature, magnetoresistance\nis very significant (-20 % for H = 7 T). It is suggested that 4f spins on Eu2+\nion is strongly exchange coupled to doped electron in Ti-3d band via f-d\ninteration and field-induced suppression of 4f spin fluctuations decrease\nspin-disorder scattering experienced by 3d electrons. In view of our results,\nit will be interesting to investigate magnetoresistance of other rare earth\ntitanates.\n", "  We have employed noise thermometry for investigations of thermal relaxation\nbetween the electrons and the substrate in nanowires patterned from 40-nm-thick\ntitanium film on top of silicon wafers covered by a native oxide. By\ncontrolling the electronic temperature $T_e$ by Joule heating at the base\ntemperature of a dilution refrigerator, we probe the electron-phonon coupling\nand the thermal boundary resistance at temperatures $T_e= 0.5 - 3$ Kelvin.\nUsing a regular $T^5$-dependent electron-phonon coupling of clean metals and a\n$T^4$-dependent interfacial heat flow, we deduce a small contribution for the\ndirect energy transfer from the titanium electrons to the substrate phonons due\nto inelastic electron-boundary scattering.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of non vacuum\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) with any spatial curvature in the\ncontext of Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The analysis employs a new method which\nenables us to explore the phase space of any specific theory of this class. We\nconsider several examples, discussing the transition from a decelerating into\nan acceleration universe within these theories. We also deduce from the\ndynamical equations some general conditions on the form of the action which\nguarantee the presence of specific behaviours like the the emergence of\naccelerated expansion. As in $f(R)$ gravity, our analysis shows that there is a\nset of initial conditions for which these models have a finite time singularity\nwhich can be an attractor. The presence of this instability also in the\nGauss-Bonnet gravity is to be ascribed to the fourth-order derivative in the\nfield equations, i.e., is the direct consequence of the higher order of the\nequations.\n", "  Here, we investigate spin Hall angle of Pt in Ni80Fe20/Pt bilayer system by\nusing a broadband spin pumping and inverse spin Hall effect measurement. An\nout-of-plane excitation geometry with application of external magnetic field\nperpendicular to the charge current direction is utilized in order to suppress\nunwanted galvanomagnetic effects. Magnetization precession angle on\nferromagnetic resonance for wide excitation frequency range (4-14 GHz) is\nestimated from the rectification voltage of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)\nand a conventional method of using microwave power in a coplanar waveguide. A\nmarked difference in the precession angle profiles for the different methods is\nobserved, resulting in the large variation in estimated values of spin current\ndensity at Ni80Fe20/Pt interface. The frequency dependence of the spin current\ndensity estimated using AMR effect is found to be similar to that of the\ninverse spin Hall voltage. We obtain the frequency-invariant spin Hall angle of\n0.067.\n", "  Biological organisms have to cope with stochastic variations in both the\nexternal environment and the internal population dynamics. Theoretical studies\nand laboratory experiments suggest that population diversification could be an\neffective bet-hedging strategy for adaptation to varying environments. Here we\nshow that bet-hedging can also be effective against demographic fluctuations\nthat pose a trade-off between growth and survival for populations even in a\nconstant environment. A species can maximize its overall abundance in the long\nterm by diversifying into coexisting subpopulations of both \"fast-growing\" and\n\"better-surviving\" individuals. Our model generalizes statistical physics\nmodels of birth-death processes to incorporate dispersal, during which new\npopulations are founded, and can further incorporate variations of local\nenvironments. In this way we unify different bet-hedging strategies against\ndemographic and environmental variations as a general means of adaptation to\nboth types of uncertainties in population growth.\n", "  Laser beams with Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) mode carry orbital angular momentum\n(OAM), however when interacting with plasmas, the net OAM acquired by plasmas\nis basically zero after interaction. Here, we find when there exist a small\nmagetostatic seed along laser propagation direction, the barrier would be\nbroken, giving rise to dramatic OAM transfer from LG lasers to plasmas. Hence,\nthe net OAM remained in plasmas system would continuously enhance the\nmagetostatic field, until the corresponding Larmor frequency of electrons is\ncomparable to the laser frequency in vacuum. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell\n(3D-PIC) simulations are performed to confirm our theory, producing\nspace-uniform, time-stable and extremely intense magetostatic fields.\n", "  The undulator is a critical component to produce synchrotron radiation and\nfree electron laser. When a Bessel light beam carrying the orbit angular\nmomentum co-propagates with an electron beam, a net transverse deflection force\nwill be subjected to the electron beam. As a result of dephasing effect, the\ndeflection force will oscillate acting as an undulator. For such a laser based\nundulator, the period length can reach sub-millimeter level, which will greatly\nreduce the electron energy for the required X-ray production.\n", "  In soft matter system controlling the structure of the amorphous materials\nhave been a key challenge. In this work we have modeled irreversible diffusion\nlimited cluster aggregation of binary colloids, which serves as a model for\nchemical gels. Irreversible aggregation of binary colloidal particles lead to\nthe formation of percolating cluster of one species or both species also called\nbigels. Before the formation of the percolating cluster the system form self\nsimilar structure defined by a fractal dimension. For a one component system\nwhen the volume fraction is very small the clusters are far apart from each\nother and the system has a fractal dimension of $1.8$. Contrary to this we will\nshow that for the binary system we observe the presence of lattice animals\nwhich has a fractal dimension of $2$ irrespective of the volume fraction. When\nthe clusters start inter penetrating we observe a fractal dimension of $2.5$\nsame as in the case of one component system. We were also able to predict the\nformation of bigels using a simple inequality relation. We have also shown that\nthe growth of clusters follows the kinetic equations introduced by Smoluchowski\nfor diffusion limited cluster aggregation. Further more we are also proposing a\nuniversal parameter for irreversible binary colloidal system, which follows the\nscaling laws proposed by percolation theory.\n", "  Given an odd vector field $Q$ on a supermanifold $M$ and a $Q$-invariant\ndensity $\\mu$ on $M$, under certain compactness conditions on $Q$, the value of\nthe integral $\\int_{M}\\mu$ is determined by the value of $\\mu$ on any\nneighborhood of the vanishing locus $N$ of $Q$. We present a formula for the\nintegral in the case where $N$ is a subsupermanifold which is appropriately\nnon-degenerate with respect to $Q$.\n  In the process, we discuss the linear algebra necessary to express our result\nin a coordinate independent way. We also extend stationary phase approximation\nand the Morse-Bott Lemma to supermanifolds.\n", "  We provide a numerical study of the macroscopic model of [3] derived from an\nagent-based model for a system of particles interacting through a dynamical\nnetwork of links. Assuming that the network remodelling process is very fast,\nthe macroscopic model takes the form of a single aggregation diffusion equation\nfor the density of particles. The theoretical study of the macroscopic model\ngives precise criteria for the phase transitions of the steady states, and in\nthe 1-dimensional case, we show numerically that the stationary solutions of\nthe microscopic model undergo the same phase transitions and bifurcation types\nas the macroscopic model. In the 2-dimensional case, we show that the numerical\nsimulations of the macroscopic model are in excellent agreement with the\npredicted theoretical values. This study provides a partial validation of the\nformal derivation of the macroscopic model from a microscopic formulation and\nshows that the former is a consistent approximation of an underlying particle\ndynamics, making it a powerful tool for the modelling of dynamical networks at\na large scale.\n", "  As usual, we observe an unknown coupling function, i.e. $F(\\varphi)$, with a\nfunction of torsion and also curvature, i.e. $f(T)$ and $f(R)$, generally\ndepending on a scalar field. In $f(R)$ case, it comes from quantum correlations\nand other reasons. Now, what if beside this term in $f(T)$-gravity context, we\nenhance the action through another term which depends on both scalar field and\nits derivatives? In this paper, we have added such an unprecedented term in the\ngeneric common action of $f(T)$-gravity such that in this new term, an unknown\nfunction of torsion has coupled with an unknown function of both scalar field\nand its derivatives. We have explained why we can append such term, in the\nintroduction in details. By the use of Noether symmetry approach, we have\nconsidered its behavior and effect. We have shown that it does not produce an\nanomaly, but rather it works successfully and numerical analysis of the exact\nsolutions of field equations coincide with all most important observational\ndata particularly late-time-accelerated expansion. So, this new term may be\nadded to the gravitational actions of $f(T)$-gravity.\n", "  We propose a non-minimal left-right symmetric model (LRSM) with Parity\nSymmetry where the fermion mixings arise as result of imposing an ${\\bf\nS}_{3}\\otimes {\\bf Z}_{2}$ flavor symmetry, and an extra ${\\bf Z}^{e}_{2}$\nsymmetry is considered to suppress some Yukawa couplings in the lepton sector.\nAs a consequence, the effective neutrino mass matrix possesses approximately\nthe $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry. The breaking of the $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry induces\nsizable non zero $\\theta_{13}$, and the deviation of $\\theta_{23}$ from\n$45^{\\circ}$ is strongly controlled by an $\\epsilon$ free parameter and the\ncomplex neutrino masses. Then, an analytic study on the extreme Majorana phases\nis done since these turn out to be relevant to enhance or suppress the reactor\nand atmospheric angle. So that we have constrained the parameter space for the\n$\\epsilon$ parameter and the lightest neutrino mass that accommodate the mixing\nangles. The highlighted results are: a) the normal hierarchy is ruled out since\nthe reactor angle comes out being tiny, for any values of the Majorana phases;\nb) for the inverted hierarchy there is one combination in the extreme phases\nwhere the values of the reactor and atmospheric angles are compatible up to $2,\n3~\\sigma$ of C. L., but the parameter space is tight; c) the model favors the\ndegenerate ordering for one combination in the extreme Majorana phases. In this\ncase, the reactor and atmospheric angle are compatible with the experimental\ndata for a large set of values of the free parameters. Therefore, this model\nmay be testable by the future result that the Nova and KamLAND-Zen\ncollaborations will provide.\n", "  We explore the formation and relaxation of so-called quasi-stationary states\n(QSS) for particle distributions in three dimensions interacting via an\nattractive radial pair potential $V(r \\rightarrow \\infty) \\sim 1/r^\\gamma$ with\n$\\gamma > 0$, and either a soft-core or hard-core regularization at small $r$.\nIn the first part of the paper we generalize, for any spatial dimension $d \\geq\n2$, Chandrasekhar's approach for the case of gravity to obtain analytic\nestimates of the rate of collisional relaxation due to two body collisions. The\nresultant relaxation rates indicate an essential qualitative difference\ndepending on the integrability of the pair force at large distances: for\n$\\gamma >d-1$ the rate diverges in the large particle number $N$ (mean field)\nlimit, unless a sufficiently large soft core is present; for $\\gamma < d-1$, on\nthe other hand, the rate vanishes in the same limit even in the absence of any\nregularization. In the second part of the paper we compare our analytical\npredictions with the results of extensive parallel numerical simulations in\n$d=3$, for a range of different exponents $\\gamma$ and soft cores leading to\nthe formation of QSS. We find, just as for the previously well studied case of\ngravity (which we also revisit), excellent agreement between the parametric\ndependence of the observed relaxation times and our analytic predictions.\nFurther, as in the case of gravity, we find that the results indicate that,\nwhen large impact factors dominate, the appropriate cut-off is the size of the\nsystem (rather than, for example, the mean inter-particle distance). Our\nresults provide strong evidence that the existence of QSS is robust only for\nlong-range interactions with a large distance behavior $\\gamma < d-1$; for\n$\\gamma \\geq d-1$ the existence of such states will be conditioned strongly on\nthe short range properties of the interaction.\n", "  In Perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach we study the direct $CP$ violation in the\npure annihilation decay process of\n$\\bar{B}^0_{s}\\rightarrow\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ induced by the $\\rho$ and\n$\\omega$ double resonance effect. Generally, the $CP$ violation is small in the\npure annihilation type decay process. However, we find that the $CP$ violation\ncan be enhanced by double $\\rho-\\omega$ interference when the invariant masses\nof the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ pairs are in the vicinity of the $\\omega$ resonance. For\nthe decay process of $\\bar{B}^0_{s}\\rightarrow\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$, the\nmaximum $CP$ violation can reach 28.64{\\%}.\n", "  The exact energy levels and wave functions of an electron free to move on a\nsphere under the radial magnetic field is found. Wave functions are expressed\nin terms of Jacobi polynomials which were well-defined and have orthogonality\nrelation, recurrence relations, series expansions etc. We have also discussed\nthe the wave functions and energy levels in case of very large magnetic field.\nLandau energy levels are shown for strong constant magnetic field occurring on\ntwo-dimensional surfaces, if the radius is very large. The results compared\nwith those previously found in the literature.\n", "  We study the stability of the Electroweak (EW) vacuum in a scale-invariant\nextension of the Standard Model and General Relativity, known as a\nHiggs-Dilaton theory. The safety of the EW vacuum against possible transition\ntowards another vacuum is a necessary condition for the model to be\nphenomenologically acceptable. We find that, within a wide range of parameters\nof the theory, the decay rate is significantly suppressed compared to that of\nthe Standard Model. We also discuss properties of a tunneling solution that are\nspecific to the Higgs-Dilaton theory.\n", "  Using supersymmetric localization, we consider four-dimensional\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theories obtained from\n$\\mathbb{Z}_n$ orbifolds of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory in the\nlarge $N$ limit at weak coupling. In particular, we show that: 1) The partition\nfunction for arbitrary couplings can be constructed in terms of universal\nbuilding blocks. 2) It can be computed in perturbation series, which converges\nuniformly for $|\\lambda_I|<\\pi^2$, where $\\lambda_I$ are the 't Hooft coupling\nof the gauge groups. 3) The perturbation series for two-point functions can be\nexplicitly computed to arbitrary orders. There is no universal effective\ncoupling by which one can express them in terms of correlators of the\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ theory. 4) One can define twisted and untwisted sector\noperators. At the perturbative orbifold point, when all the couplings are the\nsame, the correlators of untwisted sector operators coincide with those of\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory. In the twisted sector, we find\nremarkable cancellations of a certain number of planar loops, determined by the\nconformal dimension of the operator.\n", "  An efficient technique to simulate turbulent particle-laden flow at high mass\nloadings within the four-way coupled simulation regime is presented. The\ntechnique implements large eddy simulation, discrete phase simulation, a\ndeterministic treatment of inter-particle collisions and an energy-balanced\nparticle agglomeration model. The algorithm to detect inter-particle collisions\nis such that the computational costs scale linearly with the number of\nparticles present in the computational domain. On detection of a collision,\nparticle agglomeration is tested based on the pre-collision kinetic energy,\nrestitution coefficient and the van der Waals' interactions. The performance of\nthe technique developed is tested by performing parametric studies of the\ninfluence the restitution coefficient $(e_{n} = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6$ and $0.8)$,\nparticle size ($d_p = 60, 120, 200$ and $316 \\mu{m}$), fluid inertia\n($Re_{\\tau} = 150, 300$ and $590$) and particle concentration ($\\alpha_{p} =\n5.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ and $5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$) have on\nparticle-particle interaction events (collision and agglomeration). The results\ndemonstrate that the collision frequency shows a linear dependency on the\nrestitution coefficient, while the agglomeration rate shows an inverse\ndependence. Collisions among smaller particles are more frequent and efficient\nin forming agglomerates than those of coarser particles. The particle-particle\ninteraction events show a strong dependency on the shear Reynolds number\n$Re_{\\tau}$, while increasing the particle concentration effectively enhances\nparticle collision and agglomeration. Overall, the sensitivity of the\nparticle-particle interaction events to the selected simulation parameters is\nfound to influence the population and distribution of the primary particles and\nagglomerates formed.\n", "  The Sivers function describes the correlation between the transverse spin of\na nucleon and the transverse motion of its partons. It was extracted from\nmeasurements of the azimuthal asymmetry of hadrons produced in semi-inclusive\ndeep inelastic scattering of leptons off transversely polarised nucleon\ntargets, and it turned out to be non-zero for quarks. In this letter the\nevaluation of the Sivers asymmetry for gluons in the same process is presented.\nThe analysis method is based on a Monte Carlo simulation that includes three\nhard processes: photon-gluon fusion, QCD Compton scattering and leading-order\nvirtual-photon absorption process. The Sivers asymmetries of the three\nprocesses are simultaneously extracted using the LEPTO event generator and a\nneural network approach. The method is applied to samples of events containing\nat least two hadrons with large transverse momentum from the COMPASS data taken\nwith a 160 GeV/$c$ muon beam scattered off transversely polarised deuterons and\nprotons. With a significance of more than two standard deviations a negative\nvalue is obtained for the gluon Sivers asymmetry. The result of a similar\nanalysis for a Collins-like asymmetry for gluons is consistent with zero.\n", "  Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials, including artificial metamaterials, have\nbeen advanced to mold laser beams and antenna-mediated radiated waves. Here we\npropose an efficient method to control Ohmic losses inherent to natural ENZ\nmaterials by the assembly of subwavelength structures in a nonperiodic matrix\nconstituting an ENZ metacoating. Implemented over plano-concave transparent\nsubstrates whose radius can be of only a few wavelengths, ENZ surface-relief\nelements demonstrate to adequately shape a plane wave into highly localized\nfields. Furthermore, our proposal provides an energy efficiency even higher\nthan an ideally-lossless all-ENZ plano-concave lens. Our procedure is\nsatisfactory to generate aberration-free nonparaxial focused waves and\naccelerating beams in miniaturized spaces.\n", "  Quantum tunneling of the ground and first excited states in a quantum\nsuperposition driven by a novel analytical configuration of a double-well (DW)\npotential is investigated. Symmetric and asymmetric potentials are considered\nas to support quantum mechanical zero mode and first excited state analytical\nsolutions. Reporting about a symmetry breaking that supports the quantum\nconversion of a zero-mode stable vacuum into an unstable tachyonic quantum\nstate, two inequivalent topological scenarios are supposed to drive stable\ntunneling and coherent tunneling destruction respectively. A complete prospect\nof the Wigner function dynamics, vector field fluxes and the time dependence of\nstagnation points is obtained for the analytical potentials that support stable\nand tachyonic modes.\n", "  Single trapped ion qubit is an excellent candidate for quantum computation\nand information, with additional ability to coherently couple to single\nphotons. Efficient fluorescence collection is the most challenging part in\nremote entangled ion qubit state generation. To address this issue, we\ndeveloped an ion trap combining a reflective parabolic surface with trap\nelectrodes. This parabolic trap design covers a solid angle of 2pi steradians,\nand allows precise ion placement at the focal point of the parabola. We\nmeasured approximately 39% fluorescence collection from a single ion with this\nmirror, and analyzed the mirror optical performance. We observed single ion\nimage spot size of about 3.4 times diffraction limit, improved to 2.8 times\ndiffraction limit with the help of an external deformable mirror. The\nmicromotion of ion is determined to be the limiting factor, and the result is\nconsistent with theoretical calculation.\n", "  We investigate multitarget search on complex networks and derive an exact\nexpression for the mean random cover time that quantifies the expected time a\nwalker needs to visit multiple targets. Based on this, we recover and extend\nsome interesting results of multitarget search on networks. Specifically, we\nobserve the logarithmic increase of the global mean random cover time with the\ntarget number for a broad range of random search processes, including generic\nrandom walks, biased random walks, and maximal entropy random walks. We show\nthat the logarithmic growth pattern is a universal feature of multi-target\nsearch on networks by using the annealed network approach and the\nSherman-Morrison formula. Moreover, we find that for biased random walks, the\nglobal mean random cover time can be minimized, and that the corresponding\noptimal parameter also minimizes the global mean first passage time, pointing\ntowards its robustness. Our findings further confirm that the logarithmic\ngrowth pattern is a universal law governing multitarget search in confined\nmedia.\n", "  Recent studies have introduced a new class of two-dimensional acoustic\nmetamaterials whose dispersion and propagation properties results from the use\nof geometric inhomogeneities in the form of Acoustic Black Holes (ABH). The ABH\nis an element able to smoothly bend and slow down elastic waves, therefore\nproviding a variety of unconventional dispersion and propagation properties\ntypically observed in more complex multi-material and locally resonant designs.\nThis approach enables thin-walled structural elements having fully embedded\nacoustic lenses capable of different functionalities such as focusing,\ncollimation, and negative refraction. Numerical simulations show that such\nstructures exhibit broadband operating conditions that span both the\nmetamaterial and the phononic range. Full field experimental measurements allow\nvalidating the design approach and confirm the performance of the embedded\nacoustic lens.\n", "  We analyze the process of planetary scattering around M0-type stars. To do\nthis, we carry out N-body simulations with three Jupiter-mass planets close to\ntheir instability limit together with an outer planetesimal disk. This paper\nfocuses on the analysis of systems in which a single Jupiter-mass planet\nsurvives after the dynamical instability event. The small body reservoirs show\ndifferent dynamical behaviors. In fact, our simulations produce particles on\nprograde and retrograde orbits, as well as particles whose orbital plane flips\nfrom prograde to retrograde and back again along their evolution. Such\nparticles are called \"Type-F particles\". We find strong correlations between\nthe inclination $i$ and the ascending node longitude $\\Omega$ of such\nparticles. First, $\\Omega$ librates around 90$^{\\circ}$ or/and 270$^{\\circ}$.\nThis property is very important since it represents a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the flipping of an orbit. Moreover, the libration periods of $i$\nand $\\Omega$ are equal and they are out to phase by a quarter period. We also\nremark that the larger the libration amplitude of $i$, the larger the libration\namplitude of $\\Omega$. Finally, we analyze the initial conditions of Type-F\nparticles of all our simulations immediately after the dynamical instability\nevent, when a single Jupiter-mass planet survives in the system. We carry out\nthis study with the goal to determine the parameter space that lead to the\nflipping of an orbit. Our results suggest that the orbit of a test particle can\nflip for any value of its initial eccentricity, although we found only two\nType-F particles with initial inclinations $i <$ 17$^{\\circ}$. Moreover, our\nstudy indicates that the minimum value of the inclination of the Type-F\nparticles in a given system decreases with an increase in the eccentricity of\nthe giant planet.\n", "  We give an accurate determination of the vector (electromagnetic) form\nfactor, $F(Q^2)$, for a light pseudoscalar meson up to squared momentum\ntransfer $Q^2$ values of 6 $\\mathrm{GeV}^2$ for the first time from full\nlattice QCD, including $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ quarks in the sea at multiple\nvalues of the lattice spacing. Our results show good control of lattice\ndiscretisation and sea quark mass effects. We study a pseudoscalar meson made\nof valence $s$ quarks but the qualitative picture obtained applies also to the\n$\\pi$ meson, relevant to upcoming experiments at Jefferson Lab. We find that\n$Q^2F(Q^2)$ becomes flat in the region between $Q^2$ of 2 $\\mathrm{GeV}^2$ and\n6 $\\mathrm{GeV}^2$, with a value well above that of the asymptotic perturbative\nQCD expectation, but well below that of the vector-meson dominance pole form\nappropriate to low $Q^2$ values. Our calculations show that we can reach higher\n$Q^2$ values in future to shed further light on where the perturbative QCD\nresult emerges.\n", "  We present $\\text{Fuchsia}$ $-$ an implementation of the Lee algorithm, which\nfor a given system of ordinary differential equations with rational\ncoefficients $\\partial_x\\,\\mathbf{f}(x,\\epsilon) =\n\\mathbb{A}(x,\\epsilon)\\,\\mathbf{f}(x,\\epsilon)$ finds a basis transformation\n$\\mathbb{T}(x,\\epsilon)$, i.e., $\\mathbf{f}(x,\\epsilon) =\n\\mathbb{T}(x,\\epsilon)\\,\\mathbf{g}(x,\\epsilon)$, such that the system turns\ninto the epsilon form: $\\partial_x\\, \\mathbf{g}(x,\\epsilon) =\n\\epsilon\\,\\mathbb{S}(x)\\,\\mathbf{g}(x,\\epsilon)$, where $\\mathbb{S}(x)$ is a\nFuchsian matrix. A system of this form can be trivially solved in terms of\npolylogarithms as a Laurent series in the dimensional regulator $\\epsilon$.\nThat makes the construction of the transformation $\\mathbb{T}(x,\\epsilon)$\ncrucial for obtaining solutions of the initial equations.\n  In principle, $\\text{Fuchsia}$ can deal with any regular systems, however its\nprimary task is to reduce differential equations for Feynman master integrals.\nIt ensures that solutions contain only regular singularities due to the\nproperties of Feynman integrals.\n", "  Defects in field theories break translation invariance, resulting in the\nnon-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor in the directions normal to the\ndefect. This violation is known as the displacement operator. We study 4d\n${\\cal N}=1$ theories with 3d defects preserving 3d ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry\nby analyzing the embedding of the 3d superspace in the 4d superspace. We use\nthis to construct the energy-momentum multiplet of such defect field theories,\nwhich we call the defect multiplet and show how it incorporates the\ndisplacement operator. We also derive the defect multiplet by using a\nsuperspace Noether procedure.\n", "  In this paper we study the large $N$ solution to matrix models describing the\npartition functions of 3d supersymmetric gauge theories on $S^3$. The model we\nfocus on has a single $U(N)$ gauge group and fundamental fields, whose number\nscales with $N$, also known as the Veneziano limit. The novel point in our\nmodel is our choice of masses for the fundamental fields. Instead of vanishing\nor fixed masses, we consider a linear distribution. We show that the model can\nstill be solved by standard large $N$ techniques and explore the different\nphases of the model. We also commend about other natural mass distributions.\n", "  Ultrafast plasmonics of novel materials has emerged as a promising field of\nnanophotonics bringing new concepts for advanced optical applications.\nUltrafast electronic photoexcitation of a diamond surface and subsequent\nsurface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) excitation are studied both theoretically and\nexperimentally - for the first time. After photoexcitation on the rising edge\nof the pulse, transient surface metallization was found to occur for laser\nintensity near 18 TW/cm$^2$ due to enhancement of the impact ionization rate;\nin this regime, the dielectric constant of the photoexcited diamond becomes\nnegative in the trailing edge of the pulse thereby increasing the efficacy with\nwhich surface roughness leads to inhomogeneous energy absorption at the SPP\nwave-vector. These transient SPP waves imprint permanent fine and coarse\nsurface ripples oriented perpendicularly to the laser polarization. The\ntheoretical modeling is supported by the experiments on the generation of\nlaser-induced periodic surface structure on diamond surface with normally\nincident 515-nm, 200-fs laser pulses. Sub-wavelength ($\\Lambda \\approx 100$ nm)\nand near wavelength ($\\Lambda \\approx 450$ nm) surface ripples oriented\nperpendicularly to the laser polarization emerged within the ablative craters\nwith the increased number of laser shots; the spatial periods of the surface\nripples decrease with the increasing exposure following known cumulative\ntrends. The comparison between experimental data and theoretical predictions\nmakes evident the role of transient changes of the dielectric permittivity of\ndiamond during the initial stage of periodic surface ripple formation upon\nirradiation with ultrashort laser pulses.\n", "  Plasmonic nanoparticles hold great promise as photon handling elements and as\nchannels for coherent transfer of energy and information in future all-optical\ncomputing devices. Coherent energy oscillations between two spatially separated\nplasmonic entities via a virtual middle state exemplify electron-based\npopulation transfer, but their realization requires precise nanoscale\npositioning of heterogeneous particles. Here, we show the assembly and optical\nanalysis of a triple particle system consisting of two gold nanoparticles with\nan inter-spaced silver island. We observe strong plasmonic coupling between the\nspatially separated gold particles mediated by the connecting silver particle\nwith almost no dissipation of energy. As the excitation energy of the silver\nisland exceeds that of the gold particles, only quasi-occupation of the silver\ntransfer channel is possible. We describe this effect both with exact classical\nelectrodynamic modeling and qualitative quantum-mechanical calculations. We\nidentify the formation of strong hot spots between all particles as the main\nmechanism for the loss-less coupling and thus coherent ultra-fast energy\ntransfer between the remote partners. Our findings could prove useful for\nquantum gate operations, but also for classical charge and information transfer\nprocesses.\n", "  For models with several Higgs doublets we present an alternative method to\nthe one proposed by Branco, Gerard and Grimus, in 1984, to check whether or not\nCP is spontaneously violated in the Higgs potential. The previous method is\npowerful and rigorous. It requires the identification of a matrix $U$\ncorresponding to a symmetry of the Lagrangian and verifying a simple relation\ninvolving the vacuum expectation values. The nonexistence of such a matrix\nsignals spontaneous CP violation. However, as the number of Higgs doublets\nincreases, finding such a matrix $U$ may not be straightforward and it may turn\nout to be easier to analyse the potential by going to the so-called Higgs\nbasis. The transformation to the Higgs basis is straightforward once the vacuum\nexpectation values are known. The method proposed in this work is also powerful\nand rigorous and can be particularly useful to analyse models with more than\ntwo Higgs doublets and with continuous symmetries.\n", "  We investigate the limiting factors in the standard implementation of the Ca\nmagneto-optical trap. We find that intercombination transitions from the 4s5p\n1P1 state used to repump electronic population from the 3d4s 1D2 state severely\nreduce the trap lifetime. We explore seven alternative repumping schemes\ntheoretically and investigate five of them experimentally. We find all five of\nthese schemes yield a significant increase in trap lifetime and consequently\nimprove the number of atoms and peak atom density by as much as ~20x and ~6x,\nrespectively. One of these transitions, at 453 nm, is shown to approach the\nfundamental limit for a Ca magneto-optical trap with repumping only from the\n3d4s 1D2 state, yielding a trap lifetime of ~5 s.\n", "  Electron energy loss spectra have been measured on hexagonal boron nitride\nsingle crystals employing a novel electron energy loss spectroscopic set-up\ncomposed by an electron microscope equipped with a monochromator and an\nin-column filter. This set-up provides high-quality energy-loss spectra and\nallows also for the imaging of energy-filtered diffraction patterns. These two\nacquisition modes provide complementary pieces of information, offering a\nglobal view of excitations in reciprocal space. As an example of the\ncapabilities of the method we show how easily the core loss spectra at the $K$\nedges of boron and nitrogen can be measured and imaged. Low losses associated\nto interband and/or plasmon excitations are also measured. This energy range\nallows us to illustrate that our method provides results of quality comparable\nto those obtained from non resonant X-ray inelastic scattering, but with\nadvantageous specificities such as an enhanced sensitivity at low q and a much\nhigher simplicity and versatility that makes it well adapted to the study of\ntwo-dimensional materials and related heterostructures. Finally, by comparing\ntheoretical calculations against our measures, we are able to relate the range\nof applicability of ab initio calculations to the anisotropy of the sample and\nassess the level of approximation required for a proper simulation of our\nacquisition method.\n", "  Heavy quark $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ have been calculated at RHIC energy\nconsidering initial conditions with and without pre-equilibrium phase to\nhighlight the effect of the latter on heavy quark observables. The momentum\nevolution of the heavy quark has been studied by means of the Boltzmann\ntransport equation. To model the pre-equilibrium phase we have used the KLN\ninitial condition. We have found that the pre-equilibrium phase impacts the\n$R_{AA}$ of about 20-25 $\\%$ whereas the impact on $v_2$ is very negligible. We\nhave also calculated heavy quark $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ in the case of\ninitializations with early thermalized quark-gluon plasma. We have checked that\nthe particular form of the initial spectrum is not very important for $R_{AA}$,\nthe larger energy density being more important. In fact, comparing the results\nobtained within the two initializations we have found that one can mimic the\nimpact of the pre-equilibrium phase using a early thermalized QGP medium.\n", "  We describe an apparatus used to measure the electron-antineutrino angular\ncorrelation coefficient in free neutron decay. The apparatus employs a novel\nmeasurement technique in which the angular correlation is converted into a\nproton time-of-flight asymmetry that is counted directly, avoiding the need for\nproton spectroscopy. Details of the method, apparatus, detectors, data\nacquisition, and data reduction scheme are presented, along with a discussion\nof the important systematic effects.\n", "  In this paper we propose measurement induced nonlocality (MIN) using a metric\nbased on fidelity to capture global nonlocal effect of a quantum state due to\nlocally invariant projective measurements. This quantity is a remedy for local\nancilla problem in the original definition of MIN. We present an analytical\nexpression of the proposed version of MIN for pure bipartite state and 2Xn\ndimensional mixed state. We also provide an upper bound of the MIN for general\nmixed state. Finally, we compare this quantity with MINs based on\nHilbert-Schmidt norm and skew information for Werner and isotropic states.\n", "  We study the leading effective interactions between the Standard Model fields\nand a generic singlet CP-odd (pseudo)Goldstone boson. Two possible frameworks\nfor electroweak symmetry breaking are considered: linear and non-linear. For\nthe latter case, the basis of leading effective operators is determined and\ncompared with that for the linear expansion. Associated phenomenological\nsignals at colliders are explored for both scenarios, deriving new bounds and\nanalyzing future prospects, including LHC and High Luminosity LHC\nsensitivities. Mono-$Z$, mono-$W$, $W$-photon plus missing energy and on-shell\ntop final states are most promising signals expected in both frameworks. In\naddition, non-standard Higgs decays and mono-Higgs signatures are especially\nprominent and expected to be dominant in non-linear realizations.\n", "  The XGC1 edge gyrokinetic code is used for a high fidelity prediction for the\nwidth of the heat-flux to divertor plates in attached plasma condition. The\nsimulation results are validated against the empirical scaling $\\lambda_q\n\\propto B_P^{-\\gamma}$ obtained from present tokamak devices, where $\\lambda_q$\nis the divertor heat-flux width mapped to the outboard midplane and\n$\\gamma_q=1.19$ as defined by T. Eich et al. [Nucl. Fusion 53 (2013) 093031],\nand $B_P$ is the magnitude of the poloidal magnetic field at outboard midplane\nseparatrix surface. This empirical scaling predicts $\\lambda_q \\leq 1mm$ when\nextrapolated to ITER, which would require operation with very high separatrix\ndensities $(n_{sep}/n_{Greenwald} > 0.6)$ in the Q=10 scenario to achieve\nsemi-detached plasma operation and high radiative fractions leading to\nacceptable divertor power fluxes. XGC1 predicts, however, that $\\lambda_q$ for\nITER is over 5 mm, suggesting that operation in the ITER Q=10 scenario with\nacceptable divertor power loads could be obtained over a wider range of plasma\nseparatrix densities and radiative fractions. The physics reason behind this\ndifference is, according to the XGC1 results, that while the ion magnetic drift\ncontribution to the divertor heat-flux width is wider in the present tokamaks,\nthe turbulent electron contribution is wider in ITER. A high current C-Mod\ndischarge is found to be in a mixed regime: While the heat-flux width by the\nion neoclassical magnetic drift is still wider than the turbulent electron\nheat-flux width, the heat-flux magnitude is dominated by the narrower electron\nheat-flux.\n", "  The $J^P=0^-$ radial excitation $D_s(2^1S_0)$ is anticipated to have mass\n$2650$ MeV (denoted with $D_s(2650)$) though it has not been observed.\n$D_s(2650)$ is anticipated to be observed in inclusive $e^+e^-$ and $pp$\ncollisions in $D^*K$ channel. $D_s(2650)$ can be produced from hadronic decays\nof higher excited resonances. In a $^3P_0$ model, hadronic production of\n$D_s(2650)$ has been studied, relevant decay widths have been estimated. The\nhadronic decays of $D_s(3P)$ have been explored in detail, and the dominant\ndecay channels have been pointed out. Two hadronic decay channels of\n$D^+_{sJ}(2632)$ were observed by SELEX, but have not been observed by any\nother experiment. Hadronic decays of $D^+_{sJ}(2632)$ in different assignments\nhave been explored in the $^3P_0$ model. In view of the hadronic decay manner\nof $D^+_{sJ}(2632)$ , we conclude that $D^+_{sJ}(2632)$ cannot be a\nconventional charmed strange $c\\bar s$ meson.\n", "  Slow flows of a slightly rarefied gas under high thermal stresses are\nconsidered. The correct fluid-dynamic description of this class of flows is\nbased on the Kogan--Galkin--Friedlander equations, containing some\nnon-Navier--Stokes terms in the momentum equation. Appropriate boundary\nconditions are determined from the asymptotic analysis of the Knudsen layer on\nthe basis of the Boltzmann equation. Boundary conditions up to the second order\nof the Knudsen number are studied. Some two-dimensional examples are examined\nfor their comparative analysis. The fluid-dynamic results are supported by\nnumerical solution of the Boltzmann equation obtained by the Tcheremissine's\nprojection-interpolation discrete-velocity method extended for nonuniform\ngrids. The competition pattern between the first- and the second-order\nnonlinear thermal-stress flows has been obtained for the first time.\n", "  We study the nature of feedback mechanisms in the 11 CLASH brightest cluster\ngalaxies (BCGs) that exhibit extended ultraviolet and nebular line emission\nfeatures. We estimate star formation rates (SFRs), dust masses, and starburst\ndurations using a Bayesian photometry-fitting technique that accounts for both\nstellar and dust emission from the UV through far IR. By comparing these\nquantities to intracluster medium (ICM) cooling times and free-fall times\nderived from X-ray observations and lensing estimates of the cluster mass\ndistribution, we discover a tight relationship between the BCG SFR and the ICM\ncooling time to free-fall time ratio, $t_{cool}/t_{ff}$, with an upper limit on\nthe intrinsic scatter of 0.15 dex. Furthermore, starburst durations may\ncorrelate with ICM cooling times at a radius of $0.025R_{500}$, and the two\nquantities converge upon reaching the Gyr regime. Our results provide a direct\nobservational link between the thermodynamical state of the ICM and the\nintensity and duration of BCG star formation activity, and appear consistent\nwith a scenario where active galactic nuclei (AGN) induce condensation of\nthermally unstable ICM overdensities that fuel long-duration ($>$ 1 Gyr) BCG\nstarbursts. This scenario can explain (a) how gas with a low cooling time is\ndepleted without causing a cooling flow and (b) the scaling relationship\nbetween SFR and $t_{cool}/t_{ff}$. We also find that the scaling relation\nbetween SFR and dust mass in BCGs with SFRs $<100$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is\nsimilar to star-forming field galaxies; BCGs with large ($>100$ M$_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$) SFRs have dust masses comparable to extreme starbursts.\n", "  Defects play important roles in semiconductors for optoelectronic\napplications. Common intuition is that defects with shallow levels act as\ncarrier providers and defects with deep levels are carrier killers. Here,\ntaking the Cu defects in CdTe as an example, we show that shallow defects can\nplay both roles. Using first-principles calculation methods combined with\nthermodynamic simulations, we study the dialectic effects of Cu-related defects\non hole density and lifetime in bulk CdTe over a wide range of Cu incorporation\nconditions. Because CuCd can form a relatively shallow acceptor in CdTe, we\nfind that increased Cu incorporation into CdTe indeed can help achieve high\nhole density; however, too much Cu can cause significant non-radiative\nrecombination. We discuss two strategies to balance the contradictory effects\nof Cu defects based on the calculated impact of Cd chemical potential, copper\ndefect concentrations, and incorporation temperature on lifetime and hole\ndensity. The results indicates that to optimize the Cu doping in CdTe, it is\nimportant to control the total amount of Cu incorporated into CdTe and optimize\nthe match between the Cu incorporation temperature and the Cd chemical\npotential. These findings can help understand the roles of Cu defects in CdTe\nand the potential complex defect behaviors of relatively shallow defect states\nin semiconductors for optoelectronic applications.\n", "  We report the finding of new surface treatments that permit to manipulate the\nniobium resonator nitrogen content in the first few nanometers in a controlled\nway, and the resonator fundamental Mattis-Bardeen surface resistance and\nresidual resistance accordingly. In particular, we find surface infusion\nconditions that systematically a) increase the quality factor of these 1.3 GHz\nsuperconducting radio frequency (SRF) bulk niobium resonators, up to very high\ngradients; b) increase the achievable accelerating gradient of the cavity\ncompared to its own baseline with state-of-the-art surface processing. Cavities\nsubject to the new surface process have larger than two times the state of the\nart Q at 2K for accelerating fields > 35 MV/m. Moreover, very high accelerating\ngradients ~ 45 MV/m are repeatedly reached, which correspond to peak magnetic\nsurface fields of 190 mT, among the highest measured for bulk niobium cavities.\nThese findings open the opportunity to tailor the surface impurity content\ndistribution to maximize performance in Q and gradients, and have therefore\nvery important implications on future performance and cost of SRF based\naccelerators. They also help deepen the understanding of the physics of the RF\nniobium cavity surface.\n", "  In this paper, the stability of the uniform solutions is analysed for\nmicroscopic flow models in interaction with $K\\ge1$ predecessors. We calculate\ngeneral conditions for the linear stability on the ring geometry and explore\nthe results with particular pedestrian and car-following models based on\nrelaxation processes. The uniform solutions are stable if the relaxation times\nare sufficiently small. The analysis is focused on the relevance of the number\nof predecessors in the dynamics. Unexpected non-monotonic relations between $K$\nand the stability are presented.\n", "  We propose a novel method to test the binary black hole (BBH) nature of\ncompact binaries detectable by gravitational wave (GW) interferometers and\nhence constrain the parameter space of other exotic compact objects. The spirit\nof the test lies in the \"no-hair\" conjecture for black holes where all\nproperties of a black hole are characterised by the mass and the spin of the\nblack hole. The method relies on observationally measuring the quadrupole\nmoments of the compact binary constituents induced due to their spins. If the\ncompact object is a Kerr black hole (BH), its quadrupole moment is expressible\nsolely in terms of its mass and spin. Otherwise, the quadrupole moment can\ndepend on additional parameters (such as equation of state of the object). The\nhigher order spin effects in phase and amplitude of a gravitational waveform,\nwhich explicitly contains the spin-induced quadrupole moments of compact\nobjects, hence uniquely encodes the nature of the compact binary. Thus we argue\nthat an independent measurement of the spin-induced quadrupole moment of the\ncompact binaries from GW observations can provide a unique way to distinguish\nbinary BH systems from binaries consisting of exotic compact objects.\n", "  We extend the prediction range of Pionless Effective Field Theory with an\nanalysis of the ground state of $^{16}$O in leading order. To renormalize the\ntheory, we use as input both experimental data and lattice QCD predictions of\nnuclear observables, which probe the sensitivity of nuclei to increased quark\nmasses. The nuclear many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved with the\nAuxiliary Field Diffusion Monte Carlo method. For the first time in a nuclear\nquantum Monte Carlo calculation, a linear optimization procedure, which allows\nus to devise an accurate trial wave function with a large number of variational\nparameters, is adopted. The method yields a binding energy of $^{4}$He which is\nin good agreement with experiment at physical pion mass and with lattice\ncalculations at larger pion masses. At leading order we do not find any\nevidence of a $^{16}$O state which is stable against breakup into four $^4$He,\nalthough higher-order terms could bind $^{16}$O.\n", "  In this work, energy distribution and thermodynamics are investigated in the\nSchwarzschild black hole spacetime when considering corrections due to quantum\nvacuum fluctuations. The Einstein and M{\\o}ller prescriptions were used to\nderive the expressions of the energy in the background. The temperature and\nheat capacity were also derived. The results show that due to the quantum\nfluctuations in the background of the Schwarzschild black hole, all the\nenergies increase and Einstein energy differs from M{\\o}ller's one. Moreover,\nwhen increasing the quantum correction factor ($a$), the difference between\nEinstein and M{\\o}ller energies, the Unruh-Verlinde temperature as well as the\nheat capacity of the black hole increase while the Hawking temperature remains\nunchanged.\n", "  Because large-scale structure surveys may very well be the next leading\nsources of cosmological information, it is important to have a precise\nunderstanding of the cosmological observables; for this reason, the Effective\nField Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) was developed. So far, most\nresults in the EFTofLSS have used the so-called Einstein-de Sitter\napproximation, an approximation of the time dependence which is known to be\naccurate to better than one percent. However, in order to reach even higher\naccuracy, the full time dependence must be used. The computation with exact\ntime dependence is sensitive to both infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) effects\nin the loop integrands, and while these effects must cancel because of\ndiffeomorphism invariance, they make numerical computation much less efficient.\nWe provide a formulation of the one-loop, equal-time exact-time-dependence\npower spectrum of density perturbations which is manifestly free of these\nspurious IR and UV divergences at the level of the integrand. We extend our\nresults to the total matter mode with clustering quintessence, show that IR and\nUV divergences cancel, and provide the associated IR- and UV-safe integrand.\nThis also establishes that the consistency conditions are satisfied in this\nsystem. We then use our one-loop result to do an improved precision comparison\nof the two-loop dark-matter power spectrum with the Dark Sky N-body simulation.\n", "  The tree-loop duality relation is used as a starting point to derive the\nconstraints of causality and unitarity. Specifically, the Bogoliubov causality\ncondition is ab initio derived at the individual graph level. It leads to a\nrepresentation of a graph in terms of lower order cut graphs. Extracting the\nabsorptive part gives then the general unitarity relation (Cutkosky rule). The\nderivation, being carried out directly in momentum space, holds for any local\n(polynomial) hermitian interaction vertices. This is in contrast to the\ntechnical difficulties arising from contact terms in the spacetime approach\nbased on the largest time equation.\n", "  Analogy between behavior of electrons in narrow-gap semiconductors (NGS) and\nrelativistic electrons is reviewed. Energy bands in NGS correspond to special\nrelativity, the latter is analogous to two-band k.p description for NGS.\nMaximum electron velocity in NGS is u=(okolo)1x 10^8 cm/s corresponding to the\nlight velocity. An effective mass of electrons in semiconductors is introduced\nrelating their velocity to quasimomentum. This mass depends on energy similarly\nto the mass of relativistic electrons. In Hg_(1-x)Cd_(x)Te alloys one can reach\nvanishing energy gap at which electrons and light holes are 3D massless Dirac\nfermions. Wavelength lam_z is defined for NGS, in analogy to the Compton\nwavelength, lam_z is around tens of Angstroms in semiconducting materials, in\nagreement with tunneling experiments. Interband electron tunneling in NGS is in\nclose analogy to tunneling between negative and positive energies of the Dirac\nequation. Relativistic analogy holds for orbital and spin properties of\nelectrons in an external magnetic field. The spin magnetic moment of both NGS\nelectrons and relativistic electrons approaches zero with increasing energy.\nElectrons in crossed electric and magnetic fields are described. It is the\nsemirelativistic two-band description that gives a correct account of\nexperiments in this situation. A transverse Doppler shift is observed in\ncrossed fields indicating that there exists a time dilatation between an\nelectron and an observer. Phenomenon of Zitterbewegung (ZB, trembling motion)\nfor semiconductor electrons follows an analogy to free relativistic electrons.\nGraphene, carbon nanotubes, topological insulators illustrate extreme\nsemirelativistic regime. Approximations and restrictions of the relativistic\nanalogy are emphasized. It is often easier to observe semirelativistic effects\nin semiconductors than relativistic effects in vacuum.\n", "  The Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem implies that any local, Hermitian and\ntranslationally invariant lattice action in even-dimensional spacetime possess\nan equal number of left- and right-handed chiral fermions. We argue that if one\nsacrifices the property of Hermiticity while keeping the locality and\ntranslation invariance, while imposing invariance of the action under the\nspace-time (PT) reversal symmetry, then the excitation spectrum of the theory\nmay contain a non-equal number of left- and right-handed massless fermions with\nreal-valued dispersion. We illustrate our statement in a simple 1+1 dimensional\nlattice model which exhibits a skewed 8-figure patterns in its energy spectrum.\nA drawback of the model is that the PT symmetry of the Hamiltonian is\nspontaneously broken implying that the energy spectrum contains complex\nbranches. We also demonstrate that the Dirac cone is robust against local\ndisorder so that the massless excitations in this PT-invariant model are not\ngapped by random space-dependent perturbations in the couplings.\n", "  A SU(2) intertwiner with N legs can be interpreted as the quantum state of a\nconvex polyhedron with N faces (when working in 3d). We show that the\nintertwiner Hilbert space carries a representation of the non-compact group\nSO*(2N). This group can be viewed as the subgroup of the symplectic group\nSp(4N,R) which preserves the SU(2) invariance. We construct the associated\nPerelomov coherent states and discuss the notion of semi-classical limit, which\nis more subtle that we could expect. Our work completes the work by Freidel and\nLivine which focused on the U(N) subgroup of SO*(2N).\n", "  Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex is a new BiS2-based superconductor system. In\nEu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex, electron carriers are doped to the BiS2 layer by the\nsubstitution of Eu by La. Bulk superconductivity in this system is induced by\nincreasing the in-plane chemical pressure, which is controlled by the Se\nconcentration (x). In this study, we have analysed the crystal structure of\nEu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex using synchrotron powder diffraction and the Rietveld\nrefinement. The precise determination of the structural parameters and thermal\nfactors suggest that the emergence of bulk superconductivity in\nEu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex is achieved by the enhanced in-plane chemical pressure and\nthe decrease in in-plane disorder.\n", "  We compute the topologically twisted index for general $\\mathcal{N} = 2$\nsupersymmetric field theories on $\\mathbb{H}_2\\times S^1$. We also discuss\nasymptotically $AdS_4$ magnetically charged black holes with hyperbolic\nhorizon, in four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauged supergravity. With\ncertain assumptions, put forward by Benini, Hristov and Zaffaroni, we find\nprecise agreement between the black hole entropy and the topologically twisted\nindex, for $ABJM$ theories.\n", "  Using the planar Temperley-Lieb algebra, critical bond percolation on the\nsquare lattice is incorporated as ${\\cal LM}(2,3)$ in the family of Yang-Baxter\nintegrable logarithmic minimal models ${\\cal LM}(p,p')$. We consider this model\nin the presence of boundaries and with periodic boundary conditions. Inspired\nby Kuniba, Sakai and Suzuki, we rewrite the recently obtained infinite\n$Y$-system of functional equations. We obtain nonlinear integral equations in\nthe form of a closed finite set of TBA equations described by a $D_3$ Dynkin\ndiagram. Following the methods of Kl\\\"umper and Pearce, we solve the TBA\nequations for the conformal finite-size corrections. For the ground states of\nthe standard modules on the strip, these agree with the known central charge\n$c=0$ and conformal weights $\\Delta_{1,s}$ for $s\\in {\\Bbb Z_{\\ge 1}}$ with\n$\\Delta_{r,s}= \\big((3r-2s)^2-1\\big)/24$. For the periodic case, the\nfinite-size corrections agree with the conformal weights $\\Delta_{0,s}$,\n$\\Delta_{1,s}$ with $s\\in\\frac12\\Bbb Z_{\\ge0}$. These are obtained analytically\nusing Rogers dilogarithm identities. We incorporate all finite excitations by\nformulating empirical selection rules for the patterns of zeros of all the\neigenvalues of the standard modules. We thus obtain the conformal partition\nfunctions on the cylinder and the modular invariant partition function (MIPF)\non the torus. By applying $q$-binomial identities, it is shown that our\nfinitized characters on the strip agree with those of Pearce, Rasmussen and\nZuber. On the torus, the MIPF is a non-diagonal sesquilinear form in affine\n$u(1)$ characters given by the $u(1)$ partition function\n$Z_{2,3}(q)=Z_{2,3}^{\\rm{Circ}}(q)$. This is compatible with the general\nconjecture of Pearce and Rasmussen, namely\n$Z_{p,p'}(q)=Z^{\\rm{Proj}}_{p,p'}(q)+n_{p,p'}Z^{\\rm{Min}}_{p,p'}(q)$ with\n$n_{p,p'}\\in {\\Bbb Z}$, and the lattice derivation fixes $n_{2,3}=-1$.\n", "  The dynamical behavior of liquids is frequently characterized by the\nfragility, which can be defined from the temperature dependence of the shear\nviscosity, {\\eta}. For a strong liquid, the activation energy for {\\eta}\nchanges little with cooling towards the glass transition temperature, Tg. The\nchange is much greater in fragile liquids, with the activation energy becoming\nvery large near Tg. While fragility is widely recognized as an important\nconcept, for example believed to play an important role in glass formation, the\nmicroscopic origin of fragility is poorly understood. Here, we present new\nexperimental evidence showing that fragility reflects the strength of the\nrepulsive part of the interatomic potential, which can be determined from the\nsteepness of the pair distribution function near the hard-sphere cutoff. Based\non an analysis of scattering data from ten different metallic alloy liquids, we\nshow that stronger liquids have steeper repulsive potentials.\n", "  It is shown that the Nachtmann boosting method of introducing coordinates on\nde Siter manifolds can be completed with suitable gauge transformations able to\nkeep under control the transformation under isometries of the conserved\nquantities. With this method, the rest local charts (or natural frames) are\ndefined pointing out the role of the conserved quantities in investigating the\nrelative geodesic motion. The advantages of this approach can be seen from the\napplications presented here. For the first time, the simple kinematic effects,\nthe electromagnetic field of a free falling charge and the binary fission are\nsolved in terms of conserved quantities on the expanding portion of the de\nSitter spacetime.\n", "  One of the interesting portals linking a dark sector and the standard model\n(SM) is the kinetic mixing between the SM $U(1)_Y$ field with a new dark photon\n$A'$ from a $U(1)_{A'}$ gauge interaction. Stringent limits have been obtained\nfor the kinetic mixing parameter $\\epsilon$ through various processes. In this\nwork, we study the possibility of searching for a dark photon interaction at a\ncircular $e^+e^-$ collider through the process $e^+ e^-\\to \\gamma A^{\\prime *}\n\\to \\gamma \\mu^+\\mu^-$. We find that the constraint on $\\epsilon^2$ for dark\nphoton mass in the few tens of GeV range, assuming that the $\\mu^+\\mu^-$\ninvariant mass can be measured to an accuracy of $0.5\\%m_{A'}$, can be better\nthan $3\\times 10^{-6}$ for the proposed CEPC with a ten-year running at\n3$\\sigma$ (statistic) level, and better than $2\\times 10^{-6}$ for FCC-ee with\neven just one-year running at $\\sqrt{s} = 240$ GeV, better than the LHC and\nother facilities can do in a similar dark photon mass range. For FCC-ee,\nrunning at $\\sqrt{s}=160$ GeV, the constraint can be even better.\n", "  The Kepler mission has been fantastic for asteroseismology of solar-type\nstars, but the targets are typically quite distant. As a consequence, the\nreliability of asteroseismic modeling has been limited by the precision of\nadditional constraints from high-resolution spectroscopy and parallax\nmeasurements. A precise luminosity is particularly useful to minimize potential\nbiases due to the intrinsic correlation between stellar mass and initial helium\nabundance. We have applied the latest version of the Asteroseismic Modeling\nPortal (AMP) to the complete Kepler data sets for 30 stars with known rotation\nrates and chromospheric activity levels. We compare the stellar properties\nderived with and without the measured parallaxes from the first data release of\nGaia. We find that in most cases the masses and ages inferred from\nasteroseismology shift within their uncertainties. For a few targets that show\nlarger shifts, the updated stellar properties only strengthen previous\nconclusions about anomalous rotation in middle-aged stars.\n", "  Contemporary science is witnessing a rapid expansion of the two-dimensional\n(2D) materials family, each member possessing intriguing emergent properties of\nfundamental and practical importance. Using the particle-swarm optimization\nmethod in combination with first-principles density functional theory\ncalculations, here wepredict a new category of 2D monolayers named tellurene,\ncomposed of the metalloid element Te, with stable 1T-MoS2-like ( {\\alpha}-Te),\nand metastable tetragonal (\\b{eta}-Te) and 2H-MoS2-like ({\\gamma}-Te)\nstructures. The underlying formation mechanism of such tri-layer arrangements\nis uniquely rooted in the multivalent nature of Te, with the central-layer Te\nbehaving more metal-like (e.g., Mo), and the two outer layers more\nsemiconductor-like (e.g.,S). In particular, the {\\alpha}-Te phase can be\nspontaneously obtained from the magic thicknesses truncated along the [001]\ndirection of the trigonal structure of bulk Te. Furthermore, both the {\\alpha}-\nand \\b{eta}-Te phases possess electron and hole mobilities much higher than\nMoS2, as well as salient optical absorption properties. These findings\neffectively extend the realm of 2D materials to group-VI monolayers, and\nprovide a new and generic formation mechanism for designing 2D materials.\n", "  I describe a simple algorithm for numerically finding the ground state and\nlow-lying excited states of a quantum system. The algorithm is an adaptation of\nthe relaxation method for solving Poisson's equation, and is fundamentally\nbased on the variational principle. It is especially useful for two-dimensional\nsystems with nonseparable potentials, for which simpler techniques are\ninapplicable yet the computation time is minimal.\n", "  In this paper, we study energies and $g$-factors for a large number of levels\nof Th I. We found that the accuracy of CI-MBPT can be substantially improved by\nusing multiple adjustment parameters, which are introduced to regulate the\nsecond-order MBPT corrections for single valence energies and Coulomb\ninteraction. The results for energies and $g$-factors are in excellent\nagreement with experiment, with accuracy sufficient to positively assign\ntheoretical states of given angular momentum and parity to experimental levels.\nThis theory will be further developed in the future to treat other, even more\ncomplicated actinides such as U I.\n", "  We derive a fully covariant theory of the mechanics of active surfaces. This\ntheory provides a framework for the study of active biological or chemical\nprocesses at surfaces, such as the cell cortex, the mechanics of epithelial\ntissues, or reconstituted active systems on surfaces. We introduce forces and\ntorques acting on a surface, and derive the associated force balance\nconditions. We show that surfaces with in-plane rotational symmetry can have\nbroken up-down, chiral or planar-chiral symmetry. We discuss the rate of\nentropy production in the surface and write linear constitutive relations that\nsatisfy the Onsager relations. We show that the bending modulus, the\nspontaneous curvature and the surface tension of a passive surface are\nrenormalised by active terms. Finally, we identify novel active terms which are\nnot found in a passive theory and discuss examples of shape instabilities that\nare related to active processes in the surface.\n", "  We consider a relativistic charged particle in background electromagnetic\nfields depending on both space and time. We identify which symmetries of the\nfields automatically generate integrals (conserved quantities) of the charge\nmotion, accounting fully for relativistic and gauge invariance. Using this we\npresent new examples of superintegrable relativistic systems. This includes\nexamples where the integrals of motion are quadratic or nonpolynomial in the\ncanonical momenta.\n", "  A complete single-point statistical description of a narrow-band partially\npolarized optical field is developed in terms of the 2-D Period-Averaged\nProbability Density Function (PA-PDF) of the electrical field vector. This\nstatistic can be measured using the coherent (heterodyne) detection. PA-PDF\ncarries more information about the partially-polarized light than the\ntraditional Stokes vector. For a simple Gaussian partially polarized field the\nPA-PDF depends on 13 real parameters in contrast to the four parameters of the\nStokes vector or coherence tensor\n", "  Under the assumption of Abelian dominance in QCD, we have shown that chiral\ncondensate is locally present around each QCD monopole. The essence is that\neither of charge or chirality of a quark is not conserved, when the low energy\nmassless quark collides with QCD monopole. In reality, the charge is conserved\nso that the chirality is not conserved. Reviewing the presence of the local\nchiral condensate, we show by using chiral anomaly that chiral non symmetric\nquark pair production takes place when a quark is putted in a vacuum with\nmonopole condensation, while chiral symmetric pair production takes place in a\nvacuum with no monopole condensation. Our results strongly indicate that the\nchiral symmetry is broken by the monopole condensation.\n", "  Topological phases, like the celebrated Haldane phase in spin-1 chains, defy\ncharacterization through local order parameters. Instead, non-local string\norder parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted\nmagnetic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems due to\nthe phenomenon of spin-charge separation. Here we report on the direct\nobservation of such hidden magnetic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of\nhole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of non-local\nspin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range\nantiferromagnetic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge separation. Our\ntechnique demonstrates how topological order can directly be measured in\nexperiments and it can be extended to higher dimensions to study the complex\ninterplay between magnetic order and density fluctuations.\n", "  The fortieth anniversary of the original construction of Supergravity\nprovides an opportunity to combine some reminiscences of its early days with an\nassessment of its impact on the quest for a quantum theory of gravity.\n", "  We consider mixtures of Bose gases of different species. We prove that in the\nmean field limit and under suitable conditions on the initial condition a\nsystem composed of two Bose species can be effectively described by a system of\ncoupled Hartree equations. Moreover, we derive quantitative bounds on the rates\nof convergence of the reduced density matrices in Sobolev trace norms. We treat\nboth the non-relativistic case in the presence of an external magnetic field\n$A\\in L^2_{\\text{loc}}(\\R^3;\\R^3)$ and the semi-relativistic case.\n", "  We analyze the possibility of extracting a clear signal of non-linear parton\nsaturation effects from future measurements of nuclear structure functions at\nthe Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), in the small-x region. Our approach consists\nin generating pseudodata for electron-gold collisions, using the\nrunning-coupling Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation, and in assessing the\ncompatibility of these saturate pseudodata with existing sets of nuclear parton\ndistribution functions (nPDFs), extrapolated if necessary. The level of\ndisagreement between the two is quantified by applying a Bayesian reweighting\ntechnique. This allows to infer the parton distributions needed in order to\ndescribe the pseudodata, which we find quite different from the actual\ndistributions, especially for sea quarks and gluons. This tension suggests\nthat, should saturation effects impact the future nuclear structure function\ndata as predicted, a successful refitting of the nPDFs may not be achievable,\nwhich would unambiguously signal the presence of non-linear effects.\n", "  Fluctuations in the boundary region of the Alcator C-Mod tokamak have been\nanalyzed using gas puff imaging data from a set of Ohmically heated plasma\ndensity scan experiments. It is found that the relative fluctuation amplitudes\nare modest and close to normally distributed at the separatrix but become\nincreasingly larger and intermittent towards the main chamber wall. The\nfrequency power spectra are nevertheless similar for all radial positions and\nline-averaged densities. Predictions of a stochastic model, describing the\nplasma fluctuations as a super-position of uncorrelated pulses, are shown to be\nin excellent agreement with the measurements. This implies that the pulse\nduration is the same, while the degree of pulse overlap decreases radially\noutwards in the scrape-off layer. The model also describes the rate of\nthreshold level crossings, which provide novel predictions of plasma--wall\ninteractions due to transient transport events.\n", "  We discuss a novel world-line framework for computations of the Chiral\nMagnetic Effect (CME) in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Starting from\nthe fermion determinant in the QCD effective action, we show explicitly how its\nreal part can be expressed as a supersymmetric world-line action of spinning,\ncolored, Grassmanian particles in background fields. Restricting ourselves for\nsimplicity to spinning particles, we demonstrate how their constrained\nHamiltonian dynamics arises for both massless and massive particles. In a\nsemi-classical limit, this gives rise to the covariant generalization of the\nBargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation; the derivation of the corresponding Wong\nequations for colored particles is straightforward. In a previous letter we\noutlined how Berry's phase arises in a non-relativistic adiabatic limit for\nmassive particles. We extend the discussion here to systems with a finite\nchemical potential. We discuss a path integral formulation of the relative\nphase in the fermion determinant that places it on the same footing as the real\npart. We construct the corresponding anomalous world-line axial vector current\nand show in detail how the chiral anomaly appears. Our work provides a\nsystematic framework for a relativistic kinetic theory of chiral fermions in\nthe fluctuating topological backgrounds that generate the CME in a deconfined\nquark-gluon plasma. We outline some further applications of this framework in\nmany-body systems.\n", "  We write down a Robin boundary term for general relativity. The construction\nrelies on the Neumann result of arXiv:1605.01603 in an essential way. This is\nunlike in mechanics and (polynomial) field theory, where two formulations of\nthe Robin problem exist: one with Dirichlet as the natural limiting case, and\nanother with Neumann.\n", "  The upgrade to the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider will pose\nunprecedented challenges to the tracking systems of all experiments. Recent\nadvancement of active pixel detectors designed in CMOS processes provide\nattractive alternatives to the well-established hybrid design using passive\nsensors. This article presents studies with a high-voltage CMOS active pixel\nsensor designed for the ATLAS tracker upgrade. The sensor is glued to the\nread-out chip of the Insertable B-Layer. The device under test is structured in\nsmaller pixels than those of the attached read-out chip with information on the\nhit CMOS pixel encoded in the output signal (subpixel encoding). Test beam\nmeasurements mapping recorded hits in the read-out chip to CMOS pixels, thus\nvalidating the subpixel encoding, are described.\n", "  We investigate the ability of the Short Baseline Neutrino (SBN) experimental\nprogram at Fermilab to test the globally-allowed (3+$N$) sterile neutrino\noscillation parameter space. We explicitly consider the globally-allowed\nparameter space for the (3+1), (3+2), and (3+3) sterile neutrino oscillation\nscenarios. We find that SBN can probe with $5\\sigma$ sensitivity more than\n85\\%, 95\\% and 55\\% of the parameter space currently allowed at 99\\% confidence\nlevel for the (3+1), (3+2) and (3+3) scenarios, respectively. In the case of\nthe (3+2) and (3+3) scenarios, CP-violating phases appear in the oscillation\nprobability terms, leading to observable differences in the appearance\nprobabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos. We explore SBN's sensitivity to\nthose phases for the (3+2) scenario through the currently planned neutrino beam\nrunning, and investigate potential improvements through additional antineutrino\nbeam running. We show that, if antineutrino exposure is considered, for maximal\nvalues of the (3+2) CP-violating phase $\\phi_{54}$, SBN could be the first\nexperiment to directly observe $\\sim 2\\sigma$ hints of CP violation associated\nwith an extended lepton sector.\n", "  We study the naturalness properties of the $B-L$ Supersymmetric Standard\nModel (BLSSM) and compare them to those of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel (MSSM) at both low (i.e., Large Hadron Collider) energies and high (i.e.,\nunification) scales. By adopting standard measures of naturalness, we assess\nthat, in presence of full unification of the additional gauge couplings and\nscalar/fermionic masses of the BLSSM, such a scenario reveals a somewhat higher\ndegree of Fine-Tuning (FT) than the MSSM, when the latter is computed at the\nunification scale and all available theoretical and experimental constraints,\nbut the Dark Matter (DM) ones, are taken into account. Yet, such a difference,\ndriven primarily by the collider limits requiring a high mass for the gauge\nboson associated to the breaking of the additional $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge group of\nthe BLSSM in addition to the $SU(3)_C\\times SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$ of the MSSM,\nshould be regarded as a modest price to pay for the former in relation to the\nlatter, if one notices that the non-minimal scenario offers a significant\nvolume of parameter space where numerous DM solutions of different compositions\ncan be found to the relic density constraints, unlike the case of the minimal\nstructure, wherein only one type of solution is accessible over an ever\ndiminishing parameter space. In fact, this different level of tension within\nthe two SUSY models in complying with current data is well revealed when the FT\nmeasure is recomputed in terms of the low energy spectra of the two models,\nover their allowed regions of parameter space now in presence of all DM bounds,\nas it is shown that the tendency is now opposite, the BLSSM appearing more\nnatural than the MSSM.\n", "  A new second-order numerical scheme based on an operator splitting is\nproposed for the Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski model of continuum mechanics. The\nhomogeneous part of the system is solved with a finite volume method based on a\nWENO reconstruction, and the temporal ODEs are solved using some analytic\nresults presented here. Whilst it is not possible to attain arbitrary-order\naccuracy with this scheme (as with ADER-WENO schemes used previously), the\nattainable order of accuracy is often sufficient, and solutions are\ncomputationally cheap when compared with other available schemes. The new\nscheme is compared with an ADER-WENO scheme for various test cases, and a\nconvergence study is undertaken to demonstrate its order of accuracy.\n", "  We show how to achieve both fast and hyperuniform dispersions of particles in\nviscous fluids. To do so, we first extend the concept of critical random\norganization to chaotic drives. We show how palindromic sequences of chaotic\nadvection cause microscopic particles to effectively interact at long range\nthereby inhibiting critical self-organization. Based on this understanding we\ngo around this limitation and design sequences of stirring and unstirring which\nsimultaneously optimize the speed of particle spreading and the homogeneity of\nthe resulting dispersions.\n", "  Predicting the response of a system to perturbations is a key challenge in\nmathematical and natural sciences. Under suitable conditions on the nature of\nthe system, of the perturbation, and of the observables of interest, response\ntheories allow to construct operators describing the smooth change of the\ninvariant measure of the system of interest as a function of the small\nparameter controlling the intensity of the perturbation. In particular,\nresponse theories can be developed both for stochastic and chaotic\ndeterministic dynamical systems, where in the latter case stricter conditions\nimposing some degree of structural stability are required. In this paper we\nextend previous findings and derive general response formulae describing how\nn-point correlations are affected by perturbations to the vector flow. We also\nshow how to compute the response of the spectral properties of the system to\nperturbations. We then apply our results to the seemingly unrelated problem of\ncoarse graining in multiscale systems: we find explicit formulae describing the\nchange in the terms describing parameterisation of the neglected degrees of\nfreedom resulting from applying perturbations to the full system. All the terms\nenvisioned by the Mori-Zwanzig theory - the deterministic, stochastic, and\nnon-Markovian terms - are affected at 1st order in the perturbation. The\nobtained results provide a more comprehesive understanding of the response of\nstatistical mechanical systems to perturbations and contribute to the goal of\nconstructing accurate and robust parameterisations and are of potential\nrelevance for fields like molecular dynamics, condensed matter, and geophysical\nfluid dynamics. We envision possible applications of our general results to the\nstudy of the response of climate variability to anthropogenic and natural\nforcing and to the study of the equivalence of thermostatted statistical\nmechanical systems.\n", "  We study in this work a scenario that the universe undergoes a two step phase\ntransition with the first step happened to the dark matter sector and the\nsecond step being the transition between the dark matter and the electroweak\nvacuums, where the barrier between the two vacuums, that is necessary for a\nstrongly first order electroweak phase transition (EWPT) as required by the\nelectroweak baryogenesis mechanism, arises at the tree-level. We illustrate\nthis idea by working with the standard model (SM) augmented by a scalar singlet\ndark matter and an extra scalar singlet which mixes with the SM Higgs boson. We\nstudy the conditions for such pattern of phase transition to occur and\nespecially for the strongly first order EWPT to take place, as well as its\ncompatibility with the basic requirements of a successful dark matter, such as\nobserved relic density and constraints of direct detections. We further explore\nthe discovery possibility of this pattern EWPT by searching for the\ngravitational waves generated during this process in spaced based\ninterferometer, by showing a representative benchmark point of the parameter\nspace that the generated gravitational waves fall within the sensitivity of\neLISA, DECIGO and BBO.\n", "  We analytically derive the elastic, dielectric, piezoelectric, and the\nflexoelectric phenomenological coefficients as functions of microscopic model\nparameters such as ionic positions and spring constants in the two-dimensional\nsquare-lattice model with rock-salt-type ionic arrangement. Monte-Carlo\nsimulation reveals that a difference in the given elastic constants of the\ndiagonal springs, each of which connects the same cations or anions, is\nresponsible for the linear flexoelectric effect in the model. We show the\nquadratic flexoelectric effect is present only in non-centrosymmetric systems\nand it can overwhelm the linear effect in feasibly large strain gradients.\n", "  Thermoelectric materials are opening a promising pathway to address energy\nconversion issues governed by a competition between thermal and electronic\ntransport. Improving the efficiency is a difficult task, a challenge that\nrequires new strategies to unearth optimized compounds. We present a theory of\nthermoelectric transport in electron doped SrTiO3, based on a realistic tight\nbinding model that includes relevant scattering processes. We compare our\ncalculations against a wide panel of experimental data, both bulk and thin\nfilms. We find a qualitative and quantitative agreement over both a wide range\nof temperatures and carrier concentrations, from light to heavily doped.\nMoreover, the results appear insensitive to the nature of the dopant La, B, Gd\nand Nb. Thus, the quantitative success found in the case of SrTiO3, reveals an\nefficient procedure to explore new routes to improve the thermoelectric\nproperties in oxides.\n", "  Dyonic 1/4-BPS states in Type IIB string theory compactified on $\\mathrm{K}3\n\\times T^2$ are counted by meromorphic Jacobi forms. The finite parts of these\nfunctions, which are mixed mock Jacobi forms, account for the degeneracy of\nstates stable throughout the moduli space of the compactification. In this\npaper, we obtain an exact asymptotic expansion for their Fourier coefficients,\nrefining the Hardy-Ramanujan-Littlewood circle method to deal with their\nmixed-mock character. The result is compared to a low-energy supergravity\ncomputation of the exact entropy of extremal dyonic 1/4-BPS single-centered\nblack holes, obtained by applying supersymmetric localization techniques to the\nquantum entropy function.\n", "  Vertex models represent confluent tissue by polygonal or polyhedral tilings\nof space, with the individual cell interacting via force laws that depend on\nboth the geometry of the cells and the topology of the tessellation. This\ndependence on the connectivity of the cellular network introduces several\ncomplications to performing molecular-dynamics-like simulations of vertex\nmodels, and in particular makes parallelizing the simulations difficult.\ncellGPU addresses this difficulty and lays the foundation for massively\nparallelized, GPU-based simulations of these models. This article discusses its\nimplementation for a pair of two-dimensional models, and compares the typical\nperformance that can be expected between running cellGPU entirely on the CPU\nversus its performance when running on a range of commercial and server-grade\ngraphics cards. By implementing the calculation of topological changes and\nforces on cells in a highly parallelizable fashion, cellGPU enables researchers\nto simulate time- and length-scales previously inaccessible via existing\nsingle-threaded CPU implementations.\n", "  Background: The energy weighted sum rules of the single-particle spectral\nfunctions provide a quantitative understanding of the fragmentation of nuclear\nstates due to short-range and tensor correlations. Purpose: The aim of this\npaper is to compare on a quantitative basis the single-particle spectral\nfunction generated by different nuclear hamiltonians in symmetric nuclear\nmatter using the first three energy-weighted moments. Method: The spectral\nfunctions are calculated in the framework of the self-consistent Green's\nfunction approach at finite temperature within a ladder resummation scheme. We\nanalyze the first three moments of the spectral function and connect these to\nthe correlations induced by the interactions between the nucleons. In\nparticular, the variance of the spectral function is directly linked to the\ndispersive contribution of the self-energy. The discussion is centred around\ntwo- and three-body chiral nuclear interactions, with and without\nrenormalization, but we also provide results obtained with the traditional\nphase-shift-equivalent CD-Bonn and Av18 potentials. Results: The variance of\nthe spectral function is particularly sensitive to the short-range structure of\nthe force, with hard-core interactions providing large variances. Chiral forces\nyield variances which are an order of magnitude smaller and, when tamed using\nthe similarity renormalization group, the variance reduces significantly and in\nproportion to the renormalization scale. The presence of three-body forces does\nnot substantially affect the results. Conclusions: The first three moments of\nthe spectral function are useful tools in analysing the importance of\ncorrelations in nuclear ground states. In particular, the second-order moment\nprovides a direct insight into dispersive contributions to the self-energy and\nits value is indicative of the fragmentation of single-particle states.\n", "  The influence of the noncommutativity on the average speed of a relativistic\nelectron interacting with a uniform magnetic field within the minimum evolution\ntime is investigated. We find that it is possible for the wave packet of the\nelectron to travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum because of the\nnoncommutativity. It suggests that due to the noncommutativity, Lorentz\ninvariance is violated in the relativistic quantum mechanics region.\n", "  In this note, we explore the correspondence between four-dimensional flat\nspace S-matrix and two-dimensional CFT proposed by Pasterski et al. We\ndemonstrate that the factorization singularities of an n-point cubic diagram\nreproduces the AdS Witten diagrams if mass conservation is imposed at each\nvertex. Such configuration arises naturally if we consider the 4-dimensional\nS-matrix as a compactified massless 5-dimensional theory. This identification\nallows us to rewrite the massless S-matrix in the CHY formulation, where the\nfactorization singularities are re-interpreted as factorization limits of a\nRiemann sphere. In this light, the map is recast into a form of 2d/2d\ncorrespondence.\n", "  In the present paper the behavior of a single artificial microswimmer is\naddressed, namely an active droplet moving by Marangoni flow. The non-uniform\nsurface tension distribution underlying the propulsion mechanism of the\ndroplet, is generated by a non-uniform distribution of surfactant on its\nsurface. We provide a numerical treatment for the main factors playing a role\nin real systems, such as advection, diffusion and the presence of chemical\nspecies with different behaviors. The flow field inside and outside the droplet\nis derived, thus accounting for the two-way coupling between the surrounding\nfluid and the motion of the swimmer. Mass diffusion is also taken into account.\nIn particular, we consider two concentration fields: the surfactant\nconcentration in the bulk, i.e. in the liquid surrounding the droplet, and the\nsurfactant concentration on the surface. The latter is related to the local\nsurface tension, through an equation of state (Langmuir equation). We examine\ndifferent interaction mechanisms between the bulk and the surface concentration\nfields, namely the case of insoluble surfactants attached to the surface (no\nexchange between the bulk and the surface) and soluble surfactants with\nadsorption/desorption at the surface. We also consider the case where the bulk\nconcentration field is in equilibrium with the content of the droplet. The\nnumerical results are validated through comparison with analytical\ncalculations. We show that our model can reproduce the typical pusher/puller\nbehavior presented by squirmers. It is also able to capture the self-propulsion\nmechanism of droplets driven by Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reactions, as well as\na typical chemotactic behavior.\n", "  It ts known that Tsallis' q-non-additivity entails hidden correlations. It\nhas also been shown that even for a monoatomic gas, both the q-partition\nfunction $Z$ and the mean energy $<U>$ diverge and, in particular, exhibit\npoles for certain values of the Tsallis non additivity parameter $q$. This\nhappens because $Z$ and $<U>$ both depend on a $\\Gamma$-function. This\n$\\Gamma$, in turn, depends upon the spatial dimension $\\nu$. We encounter three\ndifferent regimes according to the argument $A$ of the $\\Gamma$-function. (1)\n$A>0$, (2) $A<0$ and $\\Gamma>0$ outside the poles. (3) $A$ displays poles and\nthe physics is obtained via dimensional regularization. In cases (2) and (3)\none discovers gravitational effects and quartets of particles. Moreover, bound\nstates and gravitational effects emerge as a consequence of the hidden\nq-correlations.\n", "  This paper formulates a notion of independence of subobjects of an object in\na general (i.e. not necessarily concrete) category. Subobject independence is\nthe categorial generalization of what is known as subsystem independence in the\ncontext of algebraic relativistic quantum field theory. The content of\nsubobject independence formulated in this paper is morphism co-possibility: two\nsubobjects of an object will be defined to be independent if any two morphisms\non the two subobjects of an object are jointly implementable by a single\nmorphism on the larger object. The paper investigates features of subobject\nindependence in general, and subobject independence in the category of C*\nalgebras with respect to operations (completely positive unit preserving linear\nmaps on C*-algebras) as morphisms is suggested as a natural subsystem\nindependence axiom to express relativistic locality of the covariant functor in\nthe categorial approach to quantum field theory.\n", "  A consistent description of images on the disk and of their transformations\nis given as elements of a vector space and of an operators algebra. The vector\nspace of images on the disk $\\mathbb{D}$ is the Hilbert space $L^2(\\mathbb{D})$\nthat has as a basis the Zernike functions. To construct the operator algebra\nthat transforms the images $L^2(\\mathbb{D})$ must be complemented and the full\nrigged Hilbert space $RHS(\\mathbb{D})$ considered. Only this rigged Hilbert\nspace allows indeed to write the operators of different cardinality we need to\nbuild the ladder operators on the Zernike functions that by inspection, belong\nto the representation $D_{1/2}^+ \\otimes D_{1/2}^+$ of the algebra $su(1,1)\n\\oplus su(1,1)$. Consequently the transformations of images are operators\ncontained inside the universal enveloping algebra $UEA[su(1,1) \\oplus\nsu(1,1)]$. Because of limited precision of experimental measures, physical\nstates can be always described by vectors of the Schwartz space\n$\\S(\\mathbb{D})$, dense in the $L^2(\\mathbb{D})$ space where the manipulation\nof images is performed.\n", "  A description of the effects of the local noise on the quantum entanglement\nconstraining the internal degrees of freedom of Dirac bi-spinor structures\ndriven by arbitrary Poincar\\'{e} invariant potentials is proposed. Given that\nthe Dirac equation dynamics including external potentials can be simulated by a\nsuitable four level trapped ion setup, quantum entanglement of two-qubit ionic\nstates with quantum numbers related to the total angular momentum and to its\nprojection onto the direction of the external magnetic field (used for lift the\nions degeneracy), are recovered by means of a suitable ansatz. This formalism\nallows the inclusion of noise effects, which leads to disentanglement in the\nfour level trapped ion quantum system. Our results indicate the role of\ninteractions in bi-spinor entanglement, as well as the description of\ndisentanglement in ionic states under local noises. For a state prepared\ninitially in one of the ionic levels, local noise induces entanglement sudden\ndeath followed by sudden revivals driven by the noiseless dynamics of the\nstate. Residual quantum correlations are observed in the intervals where such\nstate is separable. Schr\\\"odinger cat and Werner states partially loose their\ninitial entanglement content due to the interaction with the noisy environment\nbut presenting entanglement oscillations without sudden death. Because Dirac\nequation describes low energy excitations of mono layer and bi-layer graphene,\nthe formalism can also be applied to compute, for instance, electron-hole or\nelectron/electron entanglement in various circumstances.\n", "  We develop the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism for Podolsky's electromagnetic\ntheory on the null-plane. The main goal is to build the complete set of\nHamiltonian generators of the system, as well as to study the canonical and\ngauge transformations of the theory.\n", "  An infinite class of $4d$ $\\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories can be engineered on\nthe worldvolume of D3-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. This kind of\nsetup has multiple applications, ranging from the gauge/gravity correspondence\nto local model building in string phenomenology. Brane tilings fully encode the\ngauge theories on the D3-branes and have substantially simplified their\nconnection to the probed geometries. The purpose of this paper is to push the\nboundaries of computation and to produce as comprehensive a database of brane\ntilings as possible. We develop efficient implementations of brane tiling tools\nparticularly suited for this search. We present the first complete\nclassification of toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds with toric diagrams up to area 8 and\nthe corresponding brane tilings. This classification is of interest to both\nphysicists and mathematicians alike.\n", "  Motivated by the recently proposed parallel orbital-updating approach in real\nspace method, we propose a parallel orbital-updating based plane-wave basis\nmethod for electronic structure calculations, for solving the corresponding\neigenvalue problems. In addition, we propose two new modified parallel\norbital-updating methods. Compared to the traditional plane-wave methods, our\nmethods allow for two-level parallelization, which is particularly interesting\nfor large scale parallelization. Numerical experiments show that these new\nmethods are more reliable and efficient for large scale calculations on modern\nsupercomputers\n", "  Electromagnetic properties of single crystal terbium gallium garnet (TGG) are\ncharacterised from room down to millikelvin temperatures using the whispering\ngallery mode method. Microwave spectroscopy is performed at low powers\nequivalent to a few photons in energy and conducted as functions of the\nmagnetic field and temperature. A phase transition is detected close to the\ntemperature of 3.5 K. This is observed for multiple whispering gallery modes\ncausing an abrupt negative frequency shift and a change in transmission due to\nextra losses in the new phase caused by a change in complex magnetic\nsusceptibility.\n", "  Light-phase-sensitive techniques, such as coherent multidimensional\nspectroscopy, are well-established in a broad spectral range, already spanning\nfrom radio-frequencies in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to visible\nand ultraviolet wavelengths in nonlinear optics with table-top lasers. Here,\nthe ability to tailor the phases of electromagnetic waves with high precision\nis essential. In the present contribution we achieve phase control of\nextreme-ultraviolet pulses from a free-electron laser (FEL) on the attosecond\ntimescale in a Michelson-type all-reflective interferometric autocorrelator. By\nvarying the relative phase of the generated pulse replicas with sub-cycle\nprecision we observe the field interference, i.e. the light-wave oscillation\nwith a period of 129 as. The successful transfer of a powerful optical method\ntowards short-wavelength FEL science and technology paves the way towards\nutilization of advanced nonlinear methodologies even at partially coherent soft\nX-ray FEL sources that rely on self-amplified spontaneous emission.\n", "  The mean-field treatment of the Bose-Hubbard model predicts properties of\nlattice-trapped gases to be insensitive to the specific lattice geometry once\nsystem energies are scaled by the lattice coordination number $z$. We test this\nscaling directly by comparing coherence properties of $^{87}$Rb gases that are\ndriven across the superfluid to Mott insulator transition within optical\nlattices of either the kagome ($z=4$) or the triangular ($z=6$) geometries. The\ncoherent fraction measured for atoms in the kagome lattice is lower than for\nthose in a triangular lattice with the same interaction and tunneling energies.\nA comparison of measurements from both lattices agrees quantitatively with the\nscaling prediction. We also study the response of the gas to a change in\nlattice geometry, and observe the dynamics as a strongly interacting\nkagome-lattice gas is suddenly \"hole-doped\" by introducing the additional sites\nof the triangular lattice.\n", "  In this note we introduce a hierarchy of phase spaces for static friction,\nwhich give a graphical way to systematically quantify the directional\ndependence in static friction via subregions of the phase spaces. We\nexperimentally plot these subregions to obtain phenomenological descriptions\nfor static friction in various examples where the macroscopic shape of the\nobject affects the frictional response. The phase spaces have the universal\nproperty that for any experiment in which a given object is put on a substrate\nfashioned from a chosen material with a specified nature of contact,the\nfrictional behavior can be read off from a uniquely determined classifying map\non the control space of the experiment which takes values in the appropriate\nphase space.\n", "  As shown in the \\emph{EPR} paper (Einstein, Podolsky e Rosen, 1935), Quantum\nMechanics is a non-local Theory. The Bell theorem and the successive\nexperiments ruled out the possibility of explaining quantum correlations using\nonly local hidden variables models. Some authors suggested that quantum\ncorrelations could be due to superluminal communications that propagate\nisotropically with velocity \\emph{$v_{t}>c$} in a preferred reference frame.\nFor finite values of \\emph{$v_{t}$} and in some special cases, Quantum\nMechanics and superluminal models lead to different predictions. So far, no\ndeviations from the predictions of Quantum Mechanics have been detected and\nonly lower bounds for the superluminal velocities \\emph{$v_{t}$} have been\nestablished. Here we describe a new experiment that increases the maximum\ndetectable superluminal velocities and we give some preliminary results.\n", "  The nonlinear (full-$f$) electromagnetic gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations\nare derived in the parallel-symplectic representation from an Eulerian\ngyrokinetic variational principle. The gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations are\nshown to possess an exact energy conservation law, which is derived by Noether\nmethod from the gyrokinetic variational principle. Here, the gyrocenter Poisson\nbracket and the gyrocenter Jacobian contain contributions from the perturbed\nmagnetic field. In the full-$f$ formulation of the gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell\ntheory presented here, the gyrocenter parallel-Amp\\`{e}re equation contains a\nsecond-order contribution to the gyrocenter current density that is derived\nfrom the second-order gyrocenter ponderomotive Hamiltonian.\n", "  Within the effective QCD action for the Regge kinematics amplitudes for\nvirtual gluon emission are studied in collision of a projectile with two and\nthree targets. It is demonstrated that all un- Feynman singularities cancel\nbetween induced vertices and rescattering contributions. Formulas simplify\nconsiderably in a special gauge which is a straightforward generalization of\nthe light-cone gauge for emission of real gluons.\n", "  A general theoretical framework is derived for the recently developed\nmulti-state trajectory (MST) approach from the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, resulting in equations of motion for coupled nuclear-electronic\ndynamics equivalent to Hamilton dynamics or Heisenberg equation based on a new\nmultistate Meyer-Miller (MM) model. The derived MST formalism incorporates both\ndiabatic and adiabatic representations as limiting cases, and reduces to\nEhrenfest or Born-Oppenheimer dynamics in the mean field or the single state\nlimits, respectively. By quantizing nuclear dynamics to a particular active\nstate, the MST algorithm does not suffer from the instability caused by the\nnegative instant electronic population variables unlike the standard MM\ndynamics. Furthermore the multistate representation for electron coupled\nnuclear dynamics with each state associated with one individual trajectory\npresumably captures single state dynamics better than the mean field\ndescription. The coupled electronic-nuclear coherence is incorporated\nconsistently in the MST framework with no ad-hoc state switch and the\nassociated momentum adjustment or parameters for artificial decoherence, unlike\nthe original or modified surface hopping treatments. The implementation of the\nMST approach to benchmark problems shows reasonably good agreement with exact\nquantum calculations, and the results in both representations are similar in\naccuracy. The active state trajectory (AST) approximation of the MST approach\nprovides a consistent interpretation to trajectory surface hopping, which\npredicts the transition probabilities reasonably well for multiple nonadiabatic\ntransitions and conical intersection problems.\n", "  Recent experiments on $\\eta\\to 3\\pi$ decays have provided an extremely\nprecise knowledge of the amplitudes across the Dalitz region which represent\nstringent constraints on theoretical descriptions. We reconsider an approach in\nwhich the low-energy chiral expansion is assumed to be optimally convergent in\nan unphysical region surrounding the Adler zero, and the amplitude in the\nphysical region is uniquely deduced by an analyticity-based extrapolation using\nthe Khuri-Treiman dispersive formalism. We present an extension of the usual\nformalism which implements the leading inelastic effects from the $K\\bar{K}$\nchannel in the final-state $\\pi\\pi$ interaction as well as in the initial-state\n$\\eta\\pi$ interaction. The constructed amplitude has an enlarged region of\nvalidity and accounts in a realistic way for the influence of the two light\nscalar resonances $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ in the dispersive integrals. It is\nshown that the effect of these resonances in the low energy region of the $\\eta\n\\to 3\\pi$ decay is not negligible, in particular for the $3\\pi^0$ mode, and\nimproves the description of the energy variation across the Dalitz plot. Some\nremarks are made on the scale dependence and the value of the double quark mass\nratio $Q$.\n", "  A systematic study of the spinor representation by means of the fermionic\nphysical space is accomplished and implemented. The spinor representation space\nis shown to be constrained by the Fierz-Pauli-Kofink identities among the\nspinor bilinear covariants. A robust geometric and topological structure can be\nmanifested from the spinor space, wherein, for instance, the first and second\nhomotopy groups play prominent roles on the underlying physical properties,\nassociated to the fermionic fields.\n", "  Social contact networks underlying epidemic processes in humans and animals\nare highly dynamic. The spreading of infections on such temporal networks can\ndiffer dramatically from spreading on static networks. We theoretically\ninvestigate the effects of concurrency, the number of neighbors that a node has\nat a given time point, on the epidemic threshold in the stochastic\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics on temporal network models. We show\nthat network dynamics can suppress epidemics (i.e., yield a higher epidemic\nthreshold) when the nodes' concurrency is low, but can also enhance epidemics\nwhen the concurrency is high. We analytically determine different phases of\nthis concurrency-induced transition, and confirm our results with numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  We consider a cubic nonlinear wave equation on a network and show that\ninspecting the normal modes of the graph, we can immediately identify which\nones extend into nonlinear periodic orbits. Two main classes of nonlinear\nperiodic orbits exist: modes without soft nodes and others. For the former\nwhich are the Goldstone and the bivalent modes, the linearized equations\ndecouple. A Floquet analysis was conducted systematically for chains; it\nindicates that the Goldstone mode is usually stable and the bivalent mode is\nalways unstable. The linearized equations for the second type of modes are\ncoupled, they indicate which modes will be excited when the orbit destabilizes.\nNumerical results for the second class show that modes with a single eigenvalue\nare unstable below a treshold amplitude. Conversely, modes with multiple\neigenvalues seem always unstable. This study could be applied to coupled\nmechanical systems.\n", "  Magnetic field-induced giant modification of the probabilities of five\ntransitions of $5S_{1/2}, F_g=2 \\rightarrow 5P_{3/2}, F_e=4$ of $^{85}$Rb and\nthree transitions of $5S_{1/2}, F_g=1 \\rightarrow 5P_{3/2}, F_e=3$ of $^{87}$Rb\nforbidden by selection rules for zero magnetic field has been observed\nexperimentally and described theoretically for the first time. For the case of\nexcitation with circularly-polarized ($\\sigma^+$) laser radiation, the\nprobability of $F_g=2, ~m_F=-2 \\rightarrow F_e=4, ~m_F=-1$ transition becomes\nthe largest among the seventeen transitions of $^{85}$Rb $F_g=2 \\rightarrow\nF_e=1,2,3,4$ group, and the probability of $F_g=1,~m_F=-1 \\rightarrow\nF_e=3,~m_F=0$ transition becomes the largest among the nine transitions of\n$^{87}$Rb $F_g=1 \\rightarrow F_e=0,1,2,3$ group, in a wide range of magnetic\nfield 200 -- 1000 G. Complete frequency separation of individual Zeeman\ncomponents was obtained by implementation of derivative selective reflection\ntechnique with a 300 nm-thick nanocell filled with Rb, allowing formation of\nnarrow optical resonances. Possible applications are addressed. The theoretical\nmodel is perfectly consistent with the experimental results.\n", "  It has been known that spin-dependent capacitances usually coexist with\ngeometric capacitances in a magnetic multilayer. However, the charge and energy\nstorage of the capacitance due to spin accumulation has not been fully\nunderstood. Here, we resolve this problem starting from the charge storage in\nthe spin degree of freedom: spin accumulation manifests itself as an excess of\nelectrons in one spin channel and an equal deficiency in the other under the\nquasi-neutrality condition. This enables us to model the two spin channels as\nthe two plates of a capacitor. Taking a ferromagnet/nonmagnet junction as an\nexample and using a method similar to that for treating quantum capacitance, we\nfind that a spin-accumulation (SA) capacitance can be introduced for each layer\nto measure its ability to store spins. A spatial charge storage is not\nessential for the SA capacitor and the energy stored in it is the splitting\nenergy of the spin-dependent chemical potentials instead of the electrostatic\nenergy. The SA capacitance is essentially a quantum capacitance due to spin\naccumulation on the scale of the spin-diffusion length. The SA capacitances can\nbe used to reinterpret the imaginary part of the low-frequency\nmagnetoimpedance.\n", "  Whether turbulence induced anomalous resistivity (AR) can facilitate a fast\nmagnetic reconnection in collisionless plasma is a subject of active debate for\ndecades. Recent space observations suggest that the reconnection rate can be\nhigher than the Hall-reconnection rate and turbulent dissipation is required.\nIn this paper, using particle-in-cell simulations, we present a case study of\nhow AR produced by Buneman instability accelerates magnetic reconnection. We\nfirst show that the AR/drag produced by Buneman instability in a thin electron\ncurrent layer 1) can dissipate magnetic energy stored in the current layer\nthrough dissipation of the kinetic energy of electron beams; 2) The\ninhomogeneous drag caused by wave couplings spontaneously breaks the magnetic\nfield lines and causes impulsive fast non-Hall magnetic reconnection on\nelectron-scales with a mean rate reaching 0.6 $V_A$. We then show that a\nBuneman instability driven by intense electron beams around the x-point in a 3D\nmagnetic reconnection significantly enhances the dissipation of the magnetic\nenergy. Electron-scale magnetic reconnections driven by the inhomogeneous drag\naround the x-line enhances the reconnection electric field and the in-plane\nperpendicular magnetic field. About 40\\% of the released magnetic energy is\nconverted into the electron thermal energy by AR while 50\\% is converted into\nthe kinetic energy of the electron beams through the acceleration by the\nreconnection electric field. The enhanced magnetic energy dissipation is\nbalanced by a net Poynting flux in-flow. About 10\\% of the released magnetic\nenergy is brought out by an enhanced Poynting flux out-flow. These results\nsuggest that AR with sufficient intensity and electron-scale inhomogeneity can\nsignificantly accelerate magnetic reconnection.\n", "  We analyse a simple extension of the SM with just an additional scalar\nsinglet coupled to the Higgs boson. We discuss the possible probes for\nelectroweak baryogenesis in this model including collider searches,\ngravitational wave and direct dark matter detection signals. We show that a\nlarge portion of the model parameter space exists where the observation of\ngravitational waves would allow detection while the indirect collider searches\nwould not.\n", "  In this paper we study the consistency of generalized global symmetries in\ntheories of quantum gravity, in particular string theory. Such global\nsymmetries arise in theories with $(p+1)$-form gauge fields, and for spacetime\ndimension $d\\leq p+3$ there are obstructions to their breaking even by quantum\neffects of charged objects. In 4d theories with a 2-form gauge field (or with\nan axion scalar), these fields endow Schwarzschild black holes with quantum\nhair, a global charge leading to usual trouble with remnants. We describe\nprecise mechanisms, and examples from string compactifications and holographic\npairs, in which these problems are evaded by either gauging or breaking the\nglobal symmetry, via (suitable versions of) Stuckelberg or Kaloper-Sorbo\ncouplings. We argue that even in the absence of such couplings, the generic\nsolution in string theory is the breaking of the global symmetries by cubic\nChern-Simons terms involving different antisymmetric tensor fields. We\nconjecture that any theory with (standard or higher-degree antisymmetric\ntensor) gauge fields is in the Swampland unless its effective action includes\nsuch Chern-Simons terms. This conjecture implies that many familiar theories,\nlike QED (even including the charged particles required by the Weak Gravity\nConjecture) or $\\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity in four dimensions, are\ninconsistent in quantum gravity unless they are completed by these Chern-Simons\nterms.\n", "  We study singular monopoles on open subsets in the $3$-dimensional Euclidean\nspace. We give two characterizations of Dirac type singularities. One is given\nin terms of the growth order of the norms of sections which are invariant by\nthe scattering map. The other is given in terms of the growth order of the\nnorms of the Higgs fields.\n", "  The Hamiltonian formulation of conformally invariant Weyl-squared higher\nderivative theory teaches us that conformal symmetry is expressed through\nparticular first class constraints related to the absence of the three-metric\ndeterminant and the trace of the extrinsic curvature from the theory. Any term\ndepending on them which is added to this theory breaks conformal invariance and\nturns these constraints into second class ones. Such second class constraints\nare missing in the standard canonical formulation of the conformally\nnon-invariant Einstein-Hilbert theory. It is demonstrated that such constraints\ndo appear if the theory is treated as a higher derivative one --- if the\nextrinsic curvature is promoted to an independent variable, the apparently\nmissing information about conformal behavior is revealed.\n", "  We demonstrate from a fundamental perspective the physical and mathematical\norigins of band warping and band non-parabolicity in electronic and vibrational\nstructures. Remarkably, we find a robust presence and connection with pairs of\ntopologically induced Dirac points in a primitive-rectangular lattice using a\n$p$-type tight-binding approximation. We provide a transparent analysis of\ntwo-dimensional primitive-rectangular and square Bravais lattices whose basic\nimplications generalize to more complex structures. Band warping typically\narises at the onset of a singular transition to a crystal lattice with a larger\nsymmetry group, suddenly allowing the possibility of irreducible\nrepresentations of higher dimensions at special symmetry points in reciprocal\nspace. Band non-parabolicities are altogether different higher-order features,\nalthough they may merge into band warping at the onset of a larger symmetry\ngroup. Quite separately, although still maintaining a clear connection with\nthat merging, band non-parabolicities may produce pairs of conical\nintersections at relatively low-symmetry points. Apparently, such conical\nintersections are robustly maintained by global topology requirements, rather\nthan any local symmetry protection. For two $p$-type tight-binding bands, we\nfind such pairs of conical intersections drifting along the edges of restricted\nBrillouin zones of primitive-rectangular Bravais lattices as lattice constants\nvary relatively, until they merge into degenerate warped bands at high-symmetry\npoints at the onset of a square lattice. The conical intersections that we\nfound appear to have similar topological characteristics as Dirac points\nextensively studied in graphene and other topological insulators, although our\nconical intersections have none of the symmetry complexity and protection\nafforded by the latter more complex structures.\n", "  We propose a method to generate path-entangled $N00N$-state photons from\nquantum dots (QDs) and coupled nanocavities. In the systems we considered,\ncavity mode frequencies are tuned close to the biexciton two-photon resonance.\nUnder appropriate conditions, the system can have the target $N00N$ state in\nthe energy eigenstate, as a consequence of destructive quantum interference.\nThe $N00N$ state can be generated by the resonant laser excitation. This\nmethod, first introduced for two-photon $N00N$ state ($N=2$), can be extended\ntoward higher $N00N$ state ($N>2$) based on our recipe, which is applied to the\ncase of $N=4$ as an example.\n", "  We present a saddlepoint approximation for ionization energy loss\ndistributions, valid at arbitrary relativistic velocities of the incident\nparticle 0<v/c<1, provided that ionizing collisions are still the dominant\nenergy loss mechanism. We derive a closed form solution closely related to\nMoyal's distribution. This distribution is intended for use in simulations with\nrelatively low computational overhead. The approximation generally reproduces\nthe Vavilov most probable energy loss and full width at half maximum to better\nthan 1% and 10%, respectively, with significantly better agreement as Vavilov's\nkappa approaches 1.\n", "  Very recently, in spite of various efforts in searching for two dimensional\ntopological Dirac semimetals (2D TDSMs) in phosphorene, there remains a lack of\nexperimentally efficient way to activate such phase transition and the\nunderlying mechanism for the topological phase acquisition is still\ncontroversial. Here, from first-principles calculations in combination with a\nband-sorting technique based on k.p theory, a layer-pressure topological phase\ndiagram is obtained and some of the controversies are clarified. We demonstrate\nthat, compared with tuning by external electric-fields, strain or doping by\nadsorption, hydrostatic pressure can be an experimentally more feasible way to\nactivate the topological phase transition for 2D TDSM acquisition in\nphosphorene. More importantly, the resultant TDSM state is a pristine phase\npossessing a single pair of symmetry-protected Dirac cones right at the Fermi\nlevel, in startling contrast to the pressured bulk black phosphorous where only\na carrier-mixed Dirac state can be obtained. We corroborate that the Dirac\npoints are robust under external perturbation as long as the glide-plane\nsymmetry preserves. Our findings provide a means to realize 2D pristine TDSM in\na more achievable manner, which could be crucial in the realization of\ncontrollable TDSM states in phosphorene and related 2D materials.\n", "  The 3.6 and 4.5 micron characteristics of AGB variables in the LMC and IC1613\nare discussed. For C-rich Mira variables there is a very clear\nperiod-luminosity-colour relation, where the [3.6]-[4.5] colour is associated\nwith the amount of circumstellar material and correlated with the pulsation\namplitude. The [4.5] period-luminosity relation for dusty stars is\napproximately one mag brighter than for their naked counterparts with\ncomparable periods.\n", "  A special class of higher curvature theories of gravity, Ricci Cubic Gravity\n(RCG), in general d dimensional space-time has been investigated in this paper.\nWe have used two different approaches, the linearized equations of motion and\nauxiliary field formalism to study the massive and massless graviton\npropagating modes of the AdS background. Using the auxiliary field formalism,\nwe have found the renormalized boundary stress tensor to compute the mass of\nSchwarzschild AdS and Lifshitz black holes in RCG theory.\n", "  We consider the problem of certifying binary observables based on a Bell\ninequality violation alone, a task known as self-testing of measurements. We\nintroduce a family of commutation-based measures, which encode all the distinct\narrangements of two projective observables on a qubit. These quantities by\nconstruction take into account the usual limitations of self-testing and since\nthey are \"weighted\" by the (reduced) state, they automatically deal with\nrank-deficient reduced density matrices. We show that these measures can be\nestimated from the observed Bell violation in several scenarios and the proofs\nrely only on standard linear algebra. The trade-offs turn out to be tight and,\nin particular, they give non-trivial statements for arbitrarily small\nviolations. On the other extreme, observing the maximal violation allows us to\ndeduce precisely the form of the observables, which immediately leads to a\ncomplete rigidity statement. In particular, we show that for all $n \\geq 3$ the\n$n$-partite Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko inequality self-tests the\n$n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and maximally incompatible qubit\nmeasurements on every party. Our results imply that any pair of projective\nobservables on a qubit can be certified in a truly robust manner. Finally, we\nshow that commutation-based measures give a convenient way of expressing\nrelations among more than two observables.\n", "  This is a written version of the closing talk at the 22nd Los Alamos Stellar\npulsation conference on wide field variability surveys. It comments on some of\nthe issues which arise from the meeting. These include the need for attention\nto photometric standardization (especially in the infrared) and the somewhat\ncontroversial problem of statistical bias in the use of parallaxes (and other\nmethods of distance determination). Some major advances in the use of pulsating\nvariables to study Galactic structure are mentioned. The paper includes a\nclarification of apparently conflicting results from classical Cepheids and RR\nLyrae stars in the inner Galaxy and bulge. The importance of understanding\nnon-periodic phenomena in variable stars,particularly AGB variables and RCB\nstars is stressed, especially for its relevance to mass-loss, in which\npulsation may only play a minor role.\n", "  Recently new approaches for sensing the frequency of time dependent\nHamiltonians have been presented, and it was shown that the optimal Fisher\ninformation scales as $T^{4}.$ We present here our interpretation of this new\nscaling, where the relative phase is accumulated quadratically with time, and\nshow that this can be produced by a variety of simple pulse sequences.\nInterestingly, this scaling has a limited duration, and we show that certain\npulse sequences prolong the effect. The performance of these schemes is\nanalyzed and we examine their relevance to state-of-the-art experiments. We\nanalyze the $T^{3}$ scaling of the Fisher information which appears when\nmultiple synchronized measurements are performed, and is the optimal scaling in\nthe case of a finite coherence time.\n", "  Can quantum-mechanical particles propagating on a fixed spacetime background\nbe approximated as test bodies satisfying the weak equivalence principle? We\nultimately answer the question in the negative but find that, when universality\nof free-fall is assessed locally, a nontrivial agreement between quantum\nmechanics and the weak equivalence principle exists. Implications for mass\nsensing by quantum probes are discussed in some details.\n", "  Extended Higgs sectors offer rich opportunities for various forms of\nCP-violation. Here, we describe a new form of CP-conservation and discuss its\nconsequences. We give a concrete example of a three-Higgs-doublet model dubbed\nCP4-3HDM with a CP-symmetry of order 4 and no other other accidental\nsymmetries. If the vacuum conserves this symmetry, the model is CP-conserving\nwith pairwise mass-degenerate extra neutral Higgs bosons. These fields cannot\nbe classified as CP-even or CP-odd but they can be combined into complex\nphysical fields which are CP-half-odd, that is, they pick up the $i$ factor\nupon CP transformation. These CP-half-odd scalars can be Yukawa-coupled to the\nfermion bilinears in a CP-conserving way. We discuss fundamental and\nphenomenological features of the model, and stress a peculiar clash between the\nCP-symmetry and any convention for the particle-antiparticle assignment.\n", "  Through an innovative combination of multiple observing techniques and mod-\neling, we are assembling a comprehensive understanding of the pulsation and\nclose environment of Cepheids. We developed the SPIPS modeling tool that\ncombines all observables (radial velocimetry, photometry, angular diameters\nfrom interferometry) to derive the relevant physical parameters of the star\n(effective temperature, infrared ex- cess, reddening,...) and the ratio of the\ndistance and the projection factor d/p. We present the application of SPIPS to\nthe long-period Cepheid RS Pup, for which we derive p = 1.25 +/- 0.06. The\naddition of this massive Cepheid consolidates the existing sample of p-factor\nmeasurements towards long-period pulsators. This allows us to conclude that p\nis constant or mildly variable around p = 1.29 +/- 0.04 (+/-3%) as a function\nof the pulsation period. The forthcoming Gaia DR2 will provide a considerable\nimprovement in quantity and accuracy of the trigonometric parallaxes of\nCepheids. From this sample, the SPIPS modeling tool will enable a robust\ncalibration of the Cepheid distance scale.\n", "  The family of visibility algorithms were recently introduced as mappings\nbetween time series and graphs. Here we extend this method to characterize\nspatially extended data structures by mapping scalar fields of arbitrary\ndimension into graphs. After introducing several possible extensions, we\nprovide analytical results on some topological properties of these graphs\nassociated to some types of real-valued matrices, which can be understood as\nthe high and low disorder limits of real-valued scalar fields. In particular,\nwe find a closed expression for the degree distribution of these graphs\nassociated to uncorrelated random fields of generic dimension, extending a well\nknown result in one-dimensional time series. As this result holds independently\nof the field's marginal distribution, we show that it directly yields a\nstatistical randomness test, applicable in any dimension. We showcase its\nusefulness by discriminating spatial snapshots of two-dimensional white noise\nfrom snapshots of a two-dimensional lattice of diffusively coupled chaotic\nmaps, a system that generates high dimensional spatio-temporal chaos. We\nfinally discuss the range of potential applications of this combinatorial\nframework, which include image processing in engineering, the description of\nsurface growth in material science, soft matter or medicine and the\ncharacterization of potential energy surfaces in chemistry, disordered systems\nand high energy physics. An illustration on the applicability of this method\nfor the classification of the different stages involved in carcinogenesis is\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  Arbitrary rotation of a qubit can be performed with a three-pulse sequence;\nfor example, ZYZ rotations. However, this requires precise control of the\nrelative phase and timing between the pulses, making it technically challenging\nin optical implementation in a short time scale. Here we show any ZYZ rotations\ncan be implemented with a single laser-pulse, that is {\\it a chirped pulse with\na temporal hole}. The hole of this shaped pulse induces a non-adiabatic\ninteraction in the middle of the adiabatic evolution of the chirped pulse,\nconverting the central part of an otherwise simple Z-rotation to a Y rotation,\nconstructing ZYZ rotations. The result of our experiment performed with shaped\nfemtosecond laser pulses and cold rubidium atoms shows strong agreement with\nthe theory.\n", "  We provide the first explicit example of Type IIB string theory\ncompactification on a globally defined Calabi-Yau threefold with torsion which\nresults in a four-dimensional effective theory with a non-Abelian discrete\ngauge symmetry. Our example is based on a particular Calabi-Yau manifold, the\nquotient of a product of three elliptic curves by a fixed point free action of\nZ_2 x Z_2. Its cohomology contains torsion classes in various degrees. The main\ntechnical novelty is in determining the multiplicative structure of the\n(torsion part of) the cohomology ring, and in particular showing that the cup\nproduct of second cohomology torsion elements goes non-trivially to the fourth\ncohomology. This specifies a non-Abelian, Heisenberg-type discrete symmetry\ngroup of the four-dimensional theory.\n", "  Many models of beyond Standard Model physics connect flavor symmetry with a\ndiscrete group. Having this symmetry arise spontaneously from a gauge theory\nmaintains compatibility with quantum gravity and can be used to systematically\nprevent anomalies. We minimize a number of Higgs potentials that break gauge\ngroups to discrete symmetries of interest, and examine their scalar mass\nspectra.\n", "  We explore in stochastic gravity theory whether non-Gaussian noises from the\nhigher order correlation functions of the stress tensor for quantum matter\nfields when back-reacting on the spacetime may reveal hints of multi-scale\nstructures. Anomalous diffusion may depict how a test particle experiences in a\nfractal spacetime. The hierarchy of correlations in quantum matter field\ninduces the hierarchy of correlations in geometric objects via the set of\nEinstein-Langevin equations for each correlation order. This correlation\nhierarchy kinetic theory conceptual framework, aided by the characteristics of\nstochastic processes, may serve as a conduit for connecting the low energy\n`Bottom-Up' approach with the `Top-Down' theories of quantum gravity which\npredict the appearance of fractal spacetimes at the Planck scale.\n", "  Most of the time series in nature are a mixture of signals with deterministic\nand random dynamics. Thus the distinction between these two characteristics\nbecomes important. Distinguishing between chaotic and aleatory signals is\ndifficult because they have a common wide-band power spectrum, a delta-like\nautocorrelation function, and share other features as well. In general signals\nare presented as continuous records and require to be discretized for being\nanalyzed. In this work we present different schemes for discretizing and for\ndetection of dynamical changes in time series. One of the main motivations is\nto detect transition from chaotic regime to random regime. The tools used are\noriginated in Information Theory. The schemes proposed are applied to simulated\nand real life signals, showing in all cases a high proficiency for detecting\nchanges in the dynamics of the associated time series.\n", "  Thermal states of neutron stars in soft X-ray transients (SXRTs) are thought\nto be determined by \"deep crustal heating\" in the accreted matter that drives\nthe quiescent luminosity and cooling via emission of photons and neutrinos from\nthe interior. In this study, we assume a global thermal steady-state of the\ntransient system and calculate the heating curves (quiescent surface luminosity\nas a function of mean accretion rate) predicted from theoretical models, taking\ninto account variations in the equations of state, superfluidity gaps,\nthickness of the light element layer and a phenomenological description of the\ndirect Urca threshold. We further provide a statistical analysis on the\nuncertainties in these parameters, and compare the overall results with\nobservations of several SXRTs, in particular the two sources containing the\ncoldest (SAX J1808.4-3658) and the hottest (Aql X-1) neutron stars.\nInterpretation of the observational data indicates that the direct Urca process\nis required for the most massive stars and also suggests small superfluid gaps.\n", "  We analyze large logarithmic corrections to 4D black hole entropy and relate\nthem to the Weyl anomaly. We use duality to show that counter-terms in\nEinstein-Maxwell theory can be expressed in terms of geometry alone, with no\ndependence on matter terms. We analyze the two known $\\mathcal{N} = 2$\nsupersymmetric invariants for various non-supersymmetric black holes and find\nthat both reduce to the Euler invariant. The $c$-anomaly therefore vanishes in\nthese theories and the coefficient of the large logarithms becomes topological.\nIt is therefore independent of continuous black hole parameters, such as the\nmass, even far from extremality.\n", "  Using the gauge/gravity duality, we investigate the evolution of an\nout-of-equilibrium strongly-coupled plasma from the viewpoint of the two-point\nfunction of scalar gauge-invariant operators with large conformal dimension.\nThis system is out of equilibrium due to the presence of anisotropy and/or a\nmassive scalar field. Considering various functions for the initial anisotropy\nand scalar field, we conclude that the effect of the anisotropy on the\nevolution of the two-point function is considerably more than the effect of the\nscalar field. We also show that the ordering of the equilibration time of the\none-point function for the non-probe scalar field and the correlation function\nbetween two points with a fixed separation can be reversed by changing the\ninitial configuration of the plasma, when the system is out of the equilibrium\ndue to the presence of at least two different sources like our problem. In\naddition, we find the equilibration time of the two-point function to be\nlinearly increasing with respect to the separation of the two points with a\nfixed slope, regardless of the initial configuration that we start with.\nFinally we observe that, for larger separations the geodesic connecting two\npoints on the boundary crosses the event horizon after it has reached its final\nequilibrium value, meaning that the two-point function can probe behind the\nevent horizon.\n", "  Elemental abundances of stars are the result of the complex enrichment\nhistory of their galaxy. Interpretation of observed abundances requires\nflexible modeling tools to explore and quantify the information about Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) stored in such data. Here we present Chempy, a newly\ndeveloped code for GCE modeling, representing a parametrized open one-zone\nmodel within a Bayesian framework. A Chempy model is specified by a set of 5-10\nparameters that describe the effective galaxy evolution along with the stellar\nand star-formation physics: e.g. the star-formation history, the feedback\nefficiency, the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the incidence of\nsupernova type Ia (SN Ia). Unlike established approaches, Chempy can sample the\nposterior probability distribution in the full model parameter space and test\ndata-model matches for different nucleosynthetic yield sets. We extend Chempy\nto a multi-zone scheme. As an illustrative application, we show that\ninteresting parameter constraints result from only the ages and elemental\nabundances of Sun, Arcturus and the present-day interstellar medium (ISM). For\nthe first time, we use such information to infer IMF parameter via GCE\nmodeling, where we properly marginalize over nuisance parameters and account\nfor different yield sets. We find that of the IMF $11.6_{-1.6}^{+2.1}$ %\nexplodes as core-collapse SN, compatible with Salpeter 1955. We also constrain\nthe incidence of SN Ia per 10^3 Msun to 0.5-1.4. At the same time, this Chempy\napplication shows persistent discrepancies between predicted and observed\nabundances for some elements, irrespective of the chosen yield set. These\ncannot be remedied by any variations of Chempy's parameters and could be an\nindication for missing nucleosynthetic channels. Chempy should be a powerful\ntool to confront predictions from stellar nucleosynthesis with far more complex\nabundance data sets.\n", "  We study the correlations between center vortices and Abelian monopoles for\nSU($3$) gauge group. Combining fractional fluxes of monopoles, center vortex\nfluxes are constructed in the thick center vortex model. Calculating the\npotentials induced by fractional fluxes constructing the center vortex flux in\na thick center vortex-like model and comparing with the potential induced by\ncenter vortices, we observe an attraction between fractional fluxes of\nmonopoles constructing the center vortex flux. We conclude that the center\nvortex flux is stable, as expected. In addition, we show that adding a\ncontribution of the monopole-antimonopole pairs in the potentials induced by\ncenter vortices ruins the Casimir scaling at intermediate regime.\n", "  SrxBi2Se3 is recently reported to be a superconductor derived from\ntopological insulator Bi2Se3. It shows a maximum resistive Tc of 3.25 K at\nambient pressure. We report magnetic (upto 1 GPa) and transport properties\n(upro 8 Gpa) under pressure for single crystalline Sr0.1Bi2Se3 superconductor.\nMagnetic measurements show that Tc decreases from ~2.6 K (0 GPa) to ~1.9 K\n(0.81 GPa). Similar behavior is observed in transport properties as well\nwithout much change in the metallic characteristics in normal state\nresistivity. No reentrant superconducting phase (Physical Review B 93, 144514\n(2016)) is observed at high pressure. Normal state resistivity near Tc is\nexplained by Fermi liquid model. Above 100 K, a polaronic hopping conduction\nmechanism with two parallel channels for current flow is indicated. Band\nstructure calculations indicate decreasing density of states at Fermi level\nwith pressure. In consonance with transition temperature suppression in\nconventional BCS low Tc superconductors, the pressure effect in SrxBi2Se3 is\nwell accounted by pressure induced band broadening.\n", "  Twisted graphene bilayers develop highly localised states around AA-stacked\nregions for small twist angles. We show that interaction effects may induce\neither an antiferromagnetic (AF) and a ferromagnetic (F) polarization of said\nregions, depending on the electrical bias between layers. Remarkably,\nF-polarised AA regions under bias develop spiral magnetic ordering, with a\nrelative $120^\\circ$ misalignment between neighbouring regions due to a\nfrustrated antiferromagnetic exchange. This remarkable spiral magnetism emerges\nnaturally without the need of spin-orbit coupling, and competes with the more\nconventional lattice-antiferromagnetic instability, which interestingly\ndevelops at smaller bias under weaker interactions than in monolayer graphene,\ndue to Fermi velocity suppression. This rich and electrically controllable\nmagnetism could turn twisted bilayer graphene into an ideal system to study\nfrustrated magnetism in two dimensions, with interesting potential also for a\nrange of applications.\n", "  We theoretically show that a magnet can be stably levitated on top of a\npunctured superconductor sheet in the Meissner state without applying any\nexternal field. The trapping potential created by such induced-only\nsuperconducting currents is characterized for magnetic spheres ranging from\ntens of nanometers to tens of millimeters. Such a diamagnetically levitated\nmagnet is predicted to be extremely well isolated from the environment. We\ntherefore propose to use it as an ultrasensitive force and inertial sensor. A\nmagnetomechanical read-out of its displacement can be performed by using\nsuperconducting quantum interference devices. An analysis using current\ntechnology shows that force and acceleration sensitivities on the order of\n$10^{-23}\\text{N}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ (for a 100 nm magnet) and\n$10^{-14}g/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ (for a 10 mm magnet) might be within reach in a\ncryogenic environment. Such unprecedented sensitivities can be used for a\nvariety of purposes, from designing ultra-sensitive inertial sensors for\ntechnological applications (i.e. gravimetry, avionics, and space industry), to\nscientific investigations on measuring Casimir forces of magnetic origin and\ngravitational physics.\n", "  $SU(N)$ gauge theory is time reversal invariant at $\\theta=0$ and\n$\\theta=\\pi$. We show that at $\\theta=\\pi$ there is a discrete 't Hooft anomaly\ninvolving time reversal and the center symmetry. This anomaly leads to\nconstraints on the vacua of the theory. It follows that at $\\theta=\\pi$ the\nvacuum cannot be a trivial non-degenerate gapped state. (By contrast, the\nvacuum at $\\theta=0$ is gapped, non-degenerate, and trivial.) Due to the\nanomaly, the theory admits nontrivial domain walls supporting lower-dimensional\ntheories. Depending on the nature of the vacuum at $\\theta=\\pi$, several phase\ndiagrams are possible. Assuming area law for space-like loops, one arrives at\nan inequality involving the temperatures at which CP and the center symmetry\nare restored. We also analyze alternative scenarios for $SU(2)$ gauge theory.\nThe underlying symmetry at $\\theta=\\pi$ is the dihedral group of 8 elements. If\ndeconfined loops are allowed, one can have two $O(2)$-symmetric fixed points.\nIt may also be that the four-dimensional theory around $\\theta=\\pi$ is gapless,\ne.g. a Coulomb phase could match the underlying anomalies.\n", "  Warm dense matter is difficult to generate since it corresponds to a state of\nmatter which pressure is order of magnitude larger than can be handled by\nnatural materials. A diamond anvil can be used to pressurize matter up to one\nGbar, this matter is at high density but at room temperature. High power lasers\nand heavy ion beams can generate warm dense matter but they cannot confine it\nlong enough to allow measurements of quasi-static transport coefficients such\nas viscosity or heat conduction. We present here a third method to generate\nwarm dense matter. It uses a pulsed-power driver which current rise time is\nsubstantially shortened by using a plasma opening switch, limiting the\ndevelopment of electrothermal instabilities. The switch relies on the implosion\nof a gas puff Z-pinch which carries most of the discharge current until the\npinch reaches the sample. After that, the sample is compressed until it reaches\nthe warm dense matter regime. Three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics\ncomputations show that if the density of the gas is low enough no detectable\ninstabilities (e.g. kinks and sausages modes) impede the remainder of the\nimplosion.\n", "  The problem of variable cell survival probability along the spread-out Bragg\npeak is one of the long standing problems in planning and optimisation of\nion-beam therapy. This problem is considered using the multiscale approach to\nthe physics of ion-beam therapy. The physical reasons for this problem are\nanalysed and understood on a quantitative level. A recipe of solution to this\nproblem is suggested using this approach. This recipe can be used in the design\nof a novel treatment planning and optimisation based on fundamental science.\n", "  We present an advance towards accurately predicting the arrivals of coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs) at the terrestrial planets, including Earth. For the\nfirst time, we are able to assess a CME prediction model using data over 2/3 of\na solar cycle of observations with the Heliophysics System Observatory. We\nvalidate modeling results of 1337 CMEs observed with the Solar Terrestrial\nRelations Observatory (STEREO) heliospheric imagers (HI) (science data) from 8\nyears of observations by 5 in situ observing spacecraft. We use the\nself-similar expansion model for CME fronts assuming 60 degree longitudinal\nwidth, constant speed and constant propagation direction. With these\nassumptions we find that 23%-35% of all CMEs that were predicted to hit a\ncertain spacecraft lead to clear in situ signatures, so that for 1 correct\nprediction, 2 to 3 false alarms would have been issued. In addition, we find\nthat the prediction accuracy does not degrade with the HI longitudinal\nseparation from Earth. Predicted arrival times are on average within 2.6 +/-\n16.6 hours difference of the in situ arrival time, similar to analytical and\nnumerical modeling, and a true skill statistic of 0.21. We also discuss various\nfactors that may improve the accuracy of space weather forecasting using\nwide-angle heliospheric imager observations. These results form a first order\napproximated baseline of the prediction accuracy that is possible with HI and\nother methods used for data by an operational space weather mission at the\nSun-Earth L5 point.\n", "  The specific violated mirror symmetry model is capable of generating the\nobserved lepton weak mixing matrix with a structure similar to the observed one\nthat almost lacks any visible regularities (the \"flavor riddle\"). The\npeculiarities of the Standard Model (SM): quark and lepton mass hierarchy and\nthe neutrino spectrum different from this hierarchy appear to be necessary\nconditions for reproduction of such a structure. The inverse order of the\nneutrino spectrum and a small value of the mass $m_{3}$ are here two other\nnecessary conditions. The smallness of the angle $\\Theta_{1,3}$ is determined\nthen just by small mass ratios in the hierarchical lepton spectrum. The\nexplanation is proposed for differences between the neutrino spectrum and other\nfermion spectra of SM. The inverse order of the neutrino spectrum and the\nobserved $\\Theta_{1,3}$ angle permit evaluation of the absolute values of\nneutrino masses: $m_{1}\\sim m_{2}\\sim 0.05$eV, $m_{3}\\leq 0.01$eV.\n", "  This is the first in a series of papers on the search for the 2D CFT\ndescription of a large class of 4D $\\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories. Here, we\nidentify the 2D CFT symmetry algebra and its representations, namely the\nconformal blocks of the Virasoro/W-algebra, that underlie the 2D theory and\nreproduce the Seiberg-Witten curves of the $\\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories. We\nfind that the blocks corresponding to the SU(N) $\\mathcal{S}_k$ gauge theories\ninvolve fields in certain non-unitary representations of the $W_{kN}$ algebra.\nThese conformal blocks give a prediction for the instanton partition functions\nof the 4D $\\mathcal{N} = 1$ SCFTs of class $\\mathcal{S}_k$.\n", "  The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has an optically addressable,\nhighly coherent spin. However, an NV center even in high quality\nsingle-crystalline material is a very poor source of single photons: extraction\nout of the high-index diamond is inefficient, the emission of coherent photons\nrepresents just a few per cent of the total emission, and the decay time is\nlarge. In principle, all three problems can be addressed with a resonant\nmicrocavity. In practice, it has proved difficult to implement this concept:\nphotonic engineering hinges on nano-fabrication yet it is notoriously difficult\nto process diamond without degrading the NV centers. We present here a\nmicrocavity scheme which uses minimally processed diamond, thereby preserving\nthe high quality of the starting material, and a tunable microcavity platform.\nWe demonstrate a clear change in the lifetime for multiple individual NV\ncenters on tuning both the cavity frequency and anti-node position, a Purcell\neffect. The overall Purcell factor $F_{\\rm P}=2.0$ translates to a Purcell\nfactor for the zero phonon line (ZPL) of $F_{\\rm P}^{\\rm ZPL}\\sim30$ and an\nincrease in the ZPL emission probability from $\\sim 3 \\%$ to $\\sim 46 \\%$. By\nmaking a step-change in the NV's optical properties in a deterministic way,\nthese results pave the way for much enhanced spin-photon and spin-spin\nentanglement rates.\n", "  Many Type IIb supernovae (SNe) show a prominent additional early peak in\ntheir light curves, which is generally thought to be due to the shock cooling\nof extended hydrogen-rich material surrounding the helium core of the exploding\nstar. The recent SN 2016gkg was a nearby Type IIb SN discovered shortly after\nexplosion, which makes it an excellent candidate for studying this first peak.\nWe numerically explode a large grid of extended envelope models and compare\nthese to SN 2016gkg to investigate what constraints can be derived from its\nlight curve. This includes exploring density profiles for both a convective\nenvelope and an optically thick steady-state wind, the latter of which has not\ntypically been considered for Type IIb SNe models. We find that roughly\n$\\sim0.02\\,M_\\odot$ of extended material with a radius of\n$\\approx180-260\\,R_\\odot$ reproduces the photometric light curve data,\nconsistent with pre-explosion imaging. These values are independent of the\nassumed density profile of this material, although a convective profile\nprovides a somewhat better fit. We infer from our modeling that the explosion\nmust have occurred within $\\approx2-3\\,{\\rm hrs}$ of the first observed data\npoint, demonstrating that this event was caught very close to the moment of\nexplosion. Nevertheless, our best-fitting one-dimensional models overpredict\nthe earliest velocity measurements, which suggests that the hydrogen-rich\nmaterial is not distributed in a spherically symmetric manner. We compare this\nto the asymmetries seen in the SN IIb remnant Cas A, and we discuss the\nimplications of this for Type IIb SN progenitors and explosion models.\n", "  We study the (anti)kaon nucleon interaction in the Skyrme model. The kaon\nfield is introduced as a fluctuation around the rotating Skyrmion for the\nnucleon. As an extension of our previous work, we study scattering states and\nexamine phase shifts in various kaon-nucleon channels. Then we study the\ninteraction, where we find that it consists of central and spin-orbit\ncomponents for isospin channels, $I = 0, 1$, with energy dependence and\nnonlocality. The interaction is then fitted to a Shr\\\"odinger equivalent local\npotential for s- and p-waves.\n", "  Skyrmions, topologically stable spin textures, are of great interest for new\ngenerations of spintronic devices. In general, the stabilization of skyrmions\nhas been achieved in systems with broken inversion symmetry, where the\nasymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) modifies the uniform\nmagnetic state to a swirling state. Depending on the crystal symmetries, two\ndistinct types of skyrmions, Bloch and N\\'eel types, have been observed\nexperimentally. Here, we present, the experimental manifestation of a special\ntype of spin-swirling, namely antiskyrmions, in a family of acentric tetragonal\nHeusler compounds with D2d crystal symmetry. A spiral magnetic ground-state,\nwhich propagates in the tetragonal basal plane, is transformed into a skyrmion\nlattice-state under magnetic fields applied along the tetragonal axis over a\nwide temperature interval. Direct imaging by Lorentz Transmission Electron\nMicroscopy (LTEM) shows field stabilized antiskyrmion lattices and isolated\nantiskyrmions between 100 K and 400 K, and zero-field metastable antiskyrmions\nat low temperatures.\n", "  We use a new method to prove uniqueness theorem for a coefficient inverse\nscattering problem without the phase information for the 3-D Helmholtz\nequation. We consider the case when only the modulus of the scattered wave\nfield is measured and the phase is not measured. The spatially distributed\nrefractive index is the subject of the interest in this problem. Applications\nof this problem are in imaging of nanostructures and biological cells.\n", "  Cataloging is challenging in crowded fields because sources are extremely\ncovariant with their neighbors and blending makes even the number of sources\nambiguous. We present the first optical probabilistic catalog, cataloging a\ncrowded (~0.1 sources per pixel brighter than 22nd magnitude in F606W) Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey r band image from M2. Probabilistic cataloging returns an\nensemble of catalogs inferred from the image and thus can capture source-source\ncovariance and deblending ambiguities. By comparing to a traditional catalog of\nthe same image and a Hubble Space Telescope catalog of the same region, we show\nthat our catalog ensemble better recovers sources from the image. It goes more\nthan a magnitude deeper than the traditional catalog while having a lower false\ndiscovery rate brighter than 20th magnitude. We also present an algorithm for\nreducing this catalog ensemble to a condensed catalog that is similar to a\ntraditional catalog, except it explicitly marginalizes over source-source\ncovariances and nuisance parameters. We show that this condensed catalog has a\nsimilar completeness and false discovery rate to the catalog ensemble. Future\ntelescopes will be more sensitive, and thus more of their images will be\ncrowded. Probabilistic cataloging performs better than existing software in\ncrowded fields and so should be considered when creating photometric pipelines\nin the Large Synoptic Space Telescope era.\n", "  In this work, we present an expression for the near-field thermal radiative\ntransfer between two spheres with an arbitrary numbers of coatings. We\nnumerically demonstrate that the spectrum of heat transfer between layered\nspheres exhibits novel features due to the newly introduced interfaces between\ncoatings and cores. These features include broad super-Planckian peaks at\nnon-resonant frequencies and near-field selective emission between metallic\nspheres with polar material coatings. Spheres with cores and coatings of two\ndifferent polar materials are also shown to exceed the total conductance of\nhomogeneous spheres in some cases.\n", "  Classical Cepheid variable stars are both sensitive astrophysical\nlaboratories and accurate cosmic distance tracers. We have recently\ninvestigated how the evolutionary effects of rotation impact the properties of\nthese important stars and here provide an accessible overview of some key\nelements as well as two important consequences. Firstly, rotation resolves the\nlong-standing Cepheid mass discrepancy problem. Second, rotation increases main\nsequence lifetimes, i.e, Cepheids are approximately twice as old as previously\nthought. Finally, we highlight the importance of the short-period ends of\nCepheid period distributions as indicators for model adequacy.\n", "  The exact renormalization group is used to study the RG flow of quantities in\nfield theories. The basic idea is to write an evolution operator for the flow\nand evaluate it in perturbation theory. This is easier than directly solving\nthe differential equation. This is illustrated by reproducing known results in\nfour dimensional $\\phi^4$ field theory and the two dimensional Sine-Gordon\ntheory. It is shown that the calculation of beta function is somewhat\nsimplified. The technique is also used to calculate the c-function in two\ndimensional Sine-Gordon theory. This agrees with other prescriptions for\ncalculating c-functions in the literature. If one extrapolates the connection\nbetween central charge of a CFT and entanglement entropy in two dimensions, to\nthe c-function of the perturbed CFT, then one gets a value for the entanglement\nentropy in Sine-Gordon theory that is in exact agreement with earlier\ncalculations (including one using holography) in arXiv:1610.04233.\n", "  We are experimentally investigating possible violations of standard quantum\nmechanics predictions in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy. We\ntest with high precision the Pauli Exclusion Principle and the collapse of the\nwave function (collapse models). We present our method of searching for\npossible small violations of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) for electrons,\nthrough the search for anomalous X-ray transitions in copper atoms. These\ntransitions are produced by new electrons (brought inside the copper bar by\ncirculating current) which can have the possibility to undergo Pauli-forbidden\ntransition to the 1s level already occupied by two electrons. We describe the\nVIP2 (VIolation of the Pauli Exclusion Principle) experimental data taking at\nthe Gran Sasso underground laboratories. The goal of VIP2 is to test the PEP\nfor electrons in agreement with the Messiah-Greenberg superselection rule with\nunprecedented accuracy, down to a limit in the probability that PEP is violated\nat the level of 10E-31. We show preliminary experimental results and discuss\nimplications of a possible violation.\n", "  By using the known operator product expansions (OPEs) between the lowest $16$\nhigher spin currents of spins $(1, \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3}{2},\n\\frac{3}{2}, 2,2,2,2,2,2, \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{5}{2},\n3)$ in an extension of the large ${\\cal N}=4$ linear superconformal algebra,\none determines the OPEs between the lowest $16$ higher spin currents in an\nextension of the large ${\\cal N}=4$ nonlinear superconformal algebra for\ngeneric $N$ and $k$. The Wolf space coset contains the group $G =SU(N+2)$ and\nthe affine Kac-Moody spin $1$ current has the level $k$. The next $16$ higher\nspin currents of spins $(2,\\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{5}{2},\n3,3,3,3,3,3, \\frac{7}{2}, \\frac{7}{2}, \\frac{7}{2}, \\frac{7}{2},4)$ arise in\nthe above OPEs. The most general lowest higher spin $2$ current in this\nmultiplet can be determined in terms of affine Kac-Moody spin $\\frac{1}{2}, 1$\ncurrents. By careful analysis of the zero mode (higher spin) eigenvalue\nequations, the three-point functions of bosonic higher spin $2, 3, 4$ currents\nwith two scalars are obtained for finite $N$ and $k$. Furthermore, we also\nanalyze the three-point functions of bosonic higher spin $2, 3, 4$ currents in\nthe extension of the large ${\\cal N}=4$ linear superconformal algebra. It turns\nout that the three-point functions of higher spin $2,3$ currents in the two\ncases are equal to each other at finite $N$ and $k$. Under the large $(N,k)$ 't\nHooft limit, the two descriptions for the three-point functions of higher spin\n$4$ current coincide with each other. The higher spin extension of $SO(4)$\nKnizhnik Bershadsky algebra is described.\n", "  We analyze the emergent regimes and the stimulus-response relationship of a\npopulation of noisy map neurons by means of a mean-field model, derived within\nthe framework of cumulant approach complemented by the Gaussian closure\nhypothesis. It is demonstrated that the mean-field model can qualitatively\naccount for stability and bifurcations of the exact system, capturing all the\ngeneric forms of collective behavior, including macroscopic excitability,\nsubthreshold oscillations, periodic or chaotic spiking and chaotic bursting\ndynamics. Apart from qualitative analogies, we find a substantial quantitative\nagreement between the exact and the approximate system, as reflected in\nmatching of the parameter domains admitting the different dynamical regimes, as\nwell as the characteristic properties of the associated time series. The\neffective model is further shown to reproduce with sufficient accuracy the\nphase response curves of the exact system and the assembly's response to\nexternal stimulation of finite amplitude and duration.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to obtaining a reliable and simple\nmathematical model of a dielectrophoretic force for model-based feedback\nmicromanipulation. Any such model is expected to sufficiently accurately relate\nthe voltages (electric potentials) applied to the electrodes to the resulting\nforces exerted on microparticles at given locations in the workspace. This\nmodel also has to be computationally simple enough to be used in real time as\nrequired by model-based feedback control. Most existing models involve solving\ntwo- or three-dimensional mixed boundary value problems. As such, they are\nusually analytically intractable and have to be solved numerically instead. A\nnumerical solution is, however, infeasible in real time, hence such models are\nnot suitable for feedback control. We present a novel approximation of the\nboundary value data for which a closed-form analytical solution is feasible; we\nsolve a mixed boundary value problem numerically off-line only once, and based\non this solution we approximate the mixed boundary conditions by Dirichlet\nboundary conditions. This way we get an approximated boundary value problem\nallowing the application of the analytical framework of Green's functions. Thus\nobtained closed-form analytical solution is amenable to real-time use and\nclosely matches the numerical solution of the original exact problem.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the second bosonization of the Hirota bilinear\nequation for the CKP hierarchy introduced by Date, Jimbo, Kashiwara and Miwa.\nWe show that there is a second, untwisted, Heisenberg action on the Fock space,\nin addition to the twisted Heisenberg action suggested by Date, Jimbo,\nKashiwara and Miwa and studied by van de Leur, Orlov and Shiota. We derive the\ndecomposition of the Fock space into irreducible Heisenberg modules under this\naction. We show that the space spanned by the highest weight vectors of the\nirreducible Heisenberg modules has a structure of a super vertex algebra,\nspecifically the symplectic fermions vertex algebra. We complete the second\nbosonization of the CKP Hirota equation by expressing the generating field via\nexponentiated boson vertex operators acting on a polynomial algebra with two\ninfinite sets of variables.\n", "  We aim to construct an exceptionally deep (V ~< 27) catalog of variable\nobjects in selected Galactic and extragalactic fields visited multiple times by\nthe Hubble Space Telescope (HST). While HST observations of some of these\nfields were searched for specific types of variables before (most notably, the\nextragalactic Cepheids), we attempt a systematic study of the population of\nvariable objects of all types at the magnitude range not easily accessible with\nground-based telescopes. The variability timescales that can be probed range\nfrom hours to years depending on how often a particular field has been visited.\nFor source extraction and cross-matching of sources between visits we rely on\nthe Hubble Source Catalog which includes 10^7 objects detected with WFPC2, ACS,\nand WFC3 HST instruments. The lightcurves extracted from the HSC are corrected\nfor systematic effects by applying local zero-point corrections and are\nscreened for bad measurements. For each lightcurve we compute variability\nindices sensitive to a broad range of variability types. The indices\ncharacterize the overall lightcurve scatter and smoothness. Candidate variables\nare selected as having variability index values significantly higher than\nexpected for objects of similar brightness in the given set of observations.\nThe Hubble Catalog of Variables will be released in 2018.\n", "  We study energy levels of two heteronuclear molecules moving in a spherically\nsymmetric harmonic trap. A role of electric dipole interactions is compared and\ncontrasted with our earlier results (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00631) for two\nmagnetic dipolar atoms. We stress importance of a rotational energy with its\nvalue which is very high compared to the energy of dipolar interaction. We show\nthat dipolar forces do not play a significant role in the ground state of the\nsystem under typical experimental conditions. However, there exist excited\nstates that exhibit anticrossings similar to the ones observed for magnetic\ndipoles.\n", "  The particle motion equation in the Radio Frequency (RF) quadrupole is\nderived. The motion equation shows that the general transform matrix of RF\nquadrupole with length less than or equal to 0.5b*l (b is the relativistic\nvelocity of particles and l is wavelength of radio frequency electromagnetic\nfield) can describe the particle motion in arbitrary long RF quadrupole. By\niterative integration, the general transform matrix of discrete RF quadrupole\nis derived from the motion equation. The transform matrix is in form of power\nseries of focusing parameter B. It shows that for length less than b*l, the\nseries up to 2nd order of B agrees well with the direct integration results for\nB up to 30, while for length less than 0.5b*l, the series up to 1st order is a\ngood approximation of the real solution for B less than 30 already. The formula\nof the transform matrix can be integrated into the linac or beam line design\ncode to deal with the focusing of the discrete RF quadrupole.\n", "  We derive the solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation associated with\na supersymmetric nineteen vertex model constructed from the three-dimensional\nrepresentation of the twisted quantum affine Lie superalgebra\n$U_{q}[\\mathrm{osp}\\left(2|2\\right)^{\\left(2\\right)}]\\simeq\nU_{q}[C\\left(2\\right)^{\\left(2\\right)}]$. We found three classes of solutions.\nThe type I solution is characterized by three boundary free-parameters and all\nelements of the corresponding reflection $K$-matrix are different from zero. In\nthe type II solution, the reflection $K$-matrix is even (every element of the\n$K$-matrix with an odd parity is null) and it has only one boundary\nfree-parameter. Finally, the type III solution corresponds to a diagonal\nreflection $K$-matrix with two boundary free-parameters.\n", "  Space photometric missions have been steadily accumulating observations of\nCepheids in recent years, leading to a flow of new discoveries. In this short\nreview we summarize the findings provided by the early missions such as WIRE,\nMOST, and CoRoT, and the recent results of the Kepler and K2 missions. The\nsurprising and fascinating results from the high-precision, quasi-continuous\ndata include the detection of the amplitude increase of Polaris, and exquisite\ndetails about V1154 Cyg within the original Kepler field of view. We also\nbriefly discuss the current opportunities with the K2 mission, and the\nprospects of the TESS space telescope regarding Cepheids.\n", "  We analyze subway arrival times in the New York City subway system. We find\nregimes where the gaps between trains exhibit both (unitarily invariant) random\nmatrix statistics and Poisson statistics. The departure from random matrix\nstatistics is captured by the value of the Coulomb potential along the subway\nroute. This departure becomes more pronounced as trains make more stops.\n", "  The growth of commutators of initially commuting local operators diagnoses\nthe onset of chaos in quantum many-body systems. We compute such commutators of\nlocal field operators with $N$ components in the $(2+1)$-dimensional $O(N)$\nnonlinear sigma model to leading order in $1/N$. The system is taken to be in\nthermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$ above the zero temperature quantum\ncritical point separating the symmetry broken and unbroken phases. The\ncommutator grows exponentially in time with a rate denoted $\\lambda_L$. At\nlarge $N$ the growth of chaos as measured by $\\lambda_L$ is slow because the\nmodel is weakly interacting, and we find $\\lambda_L \\approx 3.2 T/N$. The\nscaling with temperature is dictated by conformal invariance of the underlying\nquantum critical point. We also show that operators grow ballistically in space\nwith a \"butterfly velocity\" given by $v_B/c \\approx 1$ where $c$ is the\nLorentz-invariant speed of particle excitations in the system. We briefly\ncomment on the behavior of $\\lambda_L$ and $v_B$ in the neighboring symmetry\nbroken and unbroken phases.\n", "  The Cygnus X region contains giant molecular cloud complexes and populous\nassociates of massive young stars. The discovery of spatially extended, hard\ngamma-ray emission in Cygnus X by both Milagro and Fermi indicates that Cygnus\nX is also a potential source of high-energy Galactic neutrinos. Here, we adapt\nour single-zone model for cosmic ray interactions in the central molecular\nzones of starburst galaxies for use in Cygnus X. We calculate the potential\nneutrino flux corresponding to the hard gamma-ray emission from the \"Cygnus\nCocoon\" and to the soft, diffuse interstellar gamma-ray emission. We check our\nresults by comparing the corresponding gamma-ray emission against the Fermi\ninterstellar emission model and Milagro, ARGO-YBJ, and HAWC observations. In\ncomparing our results against a recent IceCube analysis and the current\nsensitivity limits, we find that neutrino emission from the Cocoon has a large\nenough flux that it could plausibly be detected, provided hadronic interactions\nare occurring at sufficiently high energies. High-energy neutrinos from Cygnus\nX would provide direct evidence for the presence of as yet unidentified PeV\nenergy accelerators in the Galactic disk.\n", "  The high precision data obtained by the {\\it Kepler} satellite allows us to\ndetect hybrid type pulsator candidates more accurately than the data obtained\nby ground-based observations. In this study, we present preliminary results on\nthe new analysis of the {\\it Kepler} light curve and high resolution\nspectroscopic observations of pulsating Am star KIC\\,9204718. Our tentative\nanalysis therefore show that the star has hybrid pulsational characteristics.\n", "  We present new large samples of Galactic Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars from the\nOGLE Galaxy Variability Survey.\n", "  We extend kinematic space to a simple scenario where the state is not fixed\nby conformal invariance: the vacuum of a conformal field theory with a boundary\n(bCFT). We identify the kinematic space associated with the boundary operator\nproduct expansion (bOPE) as a subspace of the full kinematic space. In\naddition, we establish representations of the corresponding bOPE blocks in a\ndual gravitational description. We show how the new kinematic dictionary and\nthe dynamical data in bOPE allows one to reconstruct the bulk geometry. This is\nevidence that kinematic space may be a useful construction for understanding\nbulk physics beyond just kinematics.\n", "  Understanding the multi-scale neoclassical and turbulence physics in the edge\nregion (pedestal + scrape-off layer) is required in order to reliably predict\nperformance in future fusion devices. We explore turbulent characteristics in\nthe edge region from a multiscale neoclassical and turbulent XGC1 gyrokinetic\nsimulation in a DIII-D like tokamak geometry, here excluding neutrals and\ncollisions. For an H-mode type plasma with steep pedestal, it is found that the\nelectron density fluctuations increase towards the separatrix, and stay high\nwell into the SOL, reaching a maximum value of $\\delta n_e / \\bar{n}_e \\sim\n0.18$. Blobs are observed, born around the magnetic separatrix surface and\npropagate radially outward with velocities generally less than 1 km/s. Strong\npoloidal motion of the blobs is also present, near 20 km/s, consistent with $E\n\\times B$ rotation. The electron density fluctuations show a negative skewness\nin the closed field line pedestal regions, consistent with the presence of\n\"holes\", followed by a transition to strong positive skewness across the\nseparatrix and into the SOL. These simulations indicate that not only\nneoclassical phenomena, but also turbulence, including the blob-generation\nmechanism, can remain important in the steep H-mode pedestal and SOL.\nQualitative comparisons will be made to experimental observations.\n", "  We report high-resolution neutron Compton scattering measurements of liquid\n$^4$He under saturated vapor pressure. There is excellent agreement between the\nobserved scattering and ab initio predictions of its lineshape. Quantum Monte\nCarlo calculations predict that the Bose condensate fraction is zero in the\nnormal fluid, builds up rapidly just below the superfluid transition\ntemperature, and reaches a value of approximately $7.5\\%$ below 1 K. We also\nused model fit functions to obtain from the scattering data empirical estimates\nfor the average atomic kinetic energy and Bose condensate fraction. These\nquantities are also in excellent agreement with ab initio calculations. The\nconvergence between the scattering data and Quantum Monte Carlo calculations is\nstrong evidence for a Bose broken symmetry in superfluid $^4$He.\n", "  The non-linear electrodynamics influence of pulsar magnetic field on the\nelectromagnetic pulse polarization is discussed from the point of observation\ninterpretation. The calculations of pulsar magnetic field impact on\nelectromagnetic pulse polarization are made in such a way to make it easier to\ninterpret these effects in space experiments. The law of hard emission pulse\npropagation in the pulsar magnetic field according to the vacuum non-linear\nelectrodynamics is obtained. It was shown, that due to the birefringence in the\nvacuum the front part of any hard emission pulse coming from a pulsar should be\nlinearly polarized and the rest of pulse can have arbitrary polarization.\nObservational possibilities of vacuum birefringence are discussed. The\nestimations of detector parameters such as effective area, exposure time and\nnecessity of polarization measurements with high accuracy are given. The\ncombination of large area and extremely long exposure time gives the good\nopportunity to search the fine polarization effects like vacuum non-linear\nelectrodynamics birefringence.\n", "  In this work, we study the propagators of matter fields within the framework\nof the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger theory, which takes into account the effects of\nthe Gribov copies in the gauge-fixing quantization procedure of Yang-Mills\ntheory. In full analogy with the pure gluon sector of the Refined\nGribov-Zwanziger action, a non-local long-range term in the inverse of the\nFaddeev-Popov operator is added in the matter sector. Making use of the recent\nBRST invariant formulation of the Gribov-Zwanziger framework achieved in [Capri\net al 2016], the propagators of scalar and quark fields in the adjoint and\nfundamental representations of the gauge group are worked out explicitly in the\nlinear covariant, Curci-Ferrari and maximal Abelian gauges. Whenever lattice\ndata are available, our results exhibit good qualitative agreement.\n", "  In this paper and a companion one, we study the effect of integrable line\ndefects on entanglement entropy in massive integrable field theories in 1+1\ndimensions. The current paper focuses on topological defects that are purely\ntransmissive. Using the form factor bootstrap method, we show that topological\ndefects do not affect the the entanglement entropy in the UV limit and modify\nslightly the leading exponential correction in the IR. This conclusion holds\nfor both unitary and non-unitary field theories. In contrast, non-topological\ndefects affect the entanglement entropy more significantly both in UV and IR\nlimit and will be studied in the companion paper.\n", "  In this work we exploit agglomeration based $h$-multigrid preconditioners to\nspeed-up the iterative solution of discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of\nthe Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations. As a distinctive feature $h$-coarsened\nmesh sequences are generated by recursive agglomeration of a fine grid,\nadmitting arbitrarily unstructured grids of complex domains, and agglomeration\nbased discontinuous Galerkin discretizations are employed to deal with\nagglomerated elements of coarse levels. Both the expense of building coarse\ngrid operators and the performance of the resulting multigrid iteration are\ninvestigated. For the sake of efficiency coarse grid operators are inherited\nthrough element-by-element $L^2$ projections, avoiding the cost of numerical\nintegration over agglomerated elements. Specific care is devoted to the\nprojection of viscous terms discretized by means of the BR2 dG method. We\ndemonstrate that enforcing the correct amount of stabilization on coarse grids\nlevels is mandatory for achieving uniform convergence with respect to the\nnumber of levels. The numerical solution of steady and unsteady, linear and\nnon-linear problems is considered tackling challenging 2D test cases and 3D\nreal life computations on parallel architectures. Significant execution time\ngains are documented.\n", "  We present a Density of States calculation with the Functional Fit Approach\n(DoS FFA) in SU(3) lattice gauge theory with a finite density of static color\nsources. The DoS FFA uses a parameterized density of states and determines the\nparameters of the density by fitting data from restricted Monte Carlo\nsimulations with an analytically known function. We discuss the implementation\nof DoS FFA and the results for a qualitative picture of the phase diagram in a\nmodel which is a further step towards implementing DoS FFA in full QCD. We\ndetermine the curvature $\\kappa$ in the $\\mu$-$T$ phase diagram and find a\nvalue close to the results published for full QCD.\n", "  It is explained that the Standard Model combined charge conjugation and\nparity transformation (CP) is a simultaneous complex conjugation outer\nautomorphism transformation of gauge and space-time symmetries. Simple examples\nare given for the general concept of outer automorphisms (\"symmetries of\nsymmetries\"), as well as for their possible actions on physical theories. It is\nhighlighted that complex conjugation outer automorphisms do not, in general,\nexist for all symmetries. Examples are given for cases in which the physical CP\ntransformation is violated as a consequence of requiring another symmetry. A\ntoy model is illustrated in which CP is spontaneously violated in the broken\nphase of a continuous gauge symmetry, while an unbroken outer automorphism\nprotects the topological vacuum angle at $\\theta=0$.\n", "  We develop a comprehensive description of static and dynamic spin-transfer\ntorque at interfaces between a normal metal and a magnetic material. Specific\nexamples of the latter include ferromagnets, collinear and noncollinear\nantiferromagnets, general ferrimagnets, and spin glasses. We study the limit of\nthe exchange-dominated interactions, so that the full system is isotropic in\nspin space, apart from a possible symmetry-breaking order. A general such\ninterface yields three coefficients (corresponding to three independent\ngenerators of rotations) generalizing the well-established notion of the\nspin-mixing conductance, which pertains to the collinear case. We develop a\nnonequilibrium thermodynamic description of the emerging interfacial spin\ntransfer and its effect on the collective spin dynamics, while circumventing\nthe usual discussion of spin currents and net spin dynamics. Instead, our focus\nis on the dissipation and work effectuated by the interface. Microscopic\nscattering-matrix based expressions are derived for the generalized\nspin-transfer coefficients.\n", "  Dark matter may be discovered through its capture in stars and subsequent\nannihilation. It is usually assumed that dark matter is captured after a single\nscattering event in the star, however this assumption breaks down for heavy\ndark matter, which requires multiple collisions with the star to lose enough\nkinetic energy to become captured. We analytically compute how multiple\nscatters alter the capture rate of dark matter and identify the parameter space\nwhere the affect is largest. Using these results, we then show how multiscatter\ncapture of dark matter on compact stars can be used to probe heavy ($m_X >$\nTeV) dark matter with remarkably small dark matter-nucleon scattering\ncross-sections. As one example, it is demonstrated how measuring the\ntemperature of old neutron stars in the Milky Way's center provides sensitivity\nto high mass dark matter with dark matter-nucleon scattering cross-sections\nsmaller than the xenon direct detection neutrino floor.\n", "  In the standard model flavor violating decays of the top quark and of the\nHiggs boson are highly suppressed. Further, the flavor violating decays of the\ntop and of the Higgs are also small in MSSM and not observable in current or in\nnear future experiment. In this work we show that much larger branching ratios\nfor these decays can be achieved in an extended MSSM model with an additional\nvector like quark generation. Specifically we show that in the extended model\none can achieve branching ratios for $t\\to h^0 c$ and $t\\to h^0 u$ as large as\nthe current experimental upper limits given by the ATLAS and the CMS\nCollaborations. We also analyze the flavor violating quark decay of the Higgs\nboson, i.e., $h^0\\to b\\bar s + \\bar b s$ and $h^0\\to b\\bar d + \\bar b d$. Here\nagain one finds that the branching ratio for these decays can be as large as\n$O(1)\\%$. The analysis is done with inclusion of the CP phases in the Higgs\nsector, and the effect of CP phases on the branching ratios is investigated.\nSpecifically the Higgs sector spectrum and mixings are computed involving\nquarks and mirror quarks, squarks and mirror squarks in the loops consistent\nwith the Higgs boson mass constraint. The resulting effective Lagrangian with\ninclusion of the vector like quark generation induce flavor violating decays at\nthe tree level. The test of the branching ratios predicted could come with\nfurther data from LHC13 and such branching ratios could also be accessible at\nfuture colliders such as the Higgs factories where the Higgs couplings to\nfermions will be determined with greater precision.\n", "  This is the second part of two papers where we study the effect of integrable\nline defects on bipartite entanglement entropy in integrable field theories. In\nthis paper, we consider non-topological line defects in Ising field theory. We\nderive an infinite series expression for the entanglement entropy and show that\nboth the UV and IR limits of the bulk entanglement entropy are modified by the\nline defect. In the UV limit, we give an infinite series expression for the\ncoefficient in front of the logarithmic divergence and the exact defect\n$g$-function. By tuning the defect to be purely transmissive and reflective, we\nrecover correctly the entanglement entropy of the bulk and with integrable\nboundary.\n", "  Recently the experimentalists in [PRL 116, 042501 (2016)] announced observing\nan unexpected enhancement of the electron-positron pair production signal in\none of the Beryllium-8 nuclear transitions. The following studies have been\nfocused on possible explanations based on introducing new types of particle. In\nthis work, we improve the nuclear physics modeling of the reaction by studying\nthe pair emission anisotropy and the interferences between different multipoles\nin an effective field theory inspired framework, and examine their possible\nrelevance to the anomaly. The connection between the previously measured\non-shell photon production and the pair production in the same nuclear\ntransitions is established. These improvements, absent in the original\nexperimental analysis, should be included in extracting new particle's\nproperties from the experiment of this type. We then study the possibility of\nusing the nuclear transition form factor to explain the anomaly. The reduction\nof the anomaly's significance by simply rescaling our predicted event count is\nalso investigated.\n", "  We consider two-dimensional chiral, first-order conformal field theories\ngoverning maps from the Riemann sphere to the projective light cone inside\nMinkowski space -- the natural setting for describing conformal field theories\nin two fewer dimensions. These theories have a SL(2) algebra of local bosonic\nconstraints which can be supplemented by additional fermionic constraints\ndepending on the matter content of the theory. By computing the BRST charge\nassociated with gauge fixing these constraints, we find anomalies which vanish\nfor specific target space dimensions. These critical dimensions coincide\nprecisely with those for which (biadjoint) cubic scalar theory, gauge theory\nand gravity are classically conformally invariant. Furthermore, the BRST\ncohomology of each theory contains vertex operators for the full conformal\nmultiplets of single field insertions in each of these space-time CFTs. We give\na prescription for the computation of three-point functions, and compare our\nformalism with the scattering equations approach to on-shell amplitudes.\n", "  We present and implement a non-destructive detection scheme for the\ntransition probability readout of an optical lattice clock. The scheme relies\non a differential heterodyne measurement of the dispersive properties of\nlattice-trapped atoms enhanced by a high finesse cavity. By design, this scheme\noffers a 1st order rejection of the technical noise sources, an enhanced\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and an homogeneous atom-cavity coupling. We\ntheoretically show that this scheme is optimal with respect to the photon shot\nnoise limit. We experimentally realize this detection scheme in an operational\nstrontium optical lattice clock. The resolution is on the order of a few atoms\nwith a photon scattering rate low enough to keep the atoms trapped after\ndetection. This scheme opens the door to various different interrogations\nprotocols, which reduce the frequency instability, including atom recycling,\nzero-dead time clocks with a fast repetition rate, and sub quantum projection\nnoise frequency stability.\n", "  Hamamatsu Photonics introduced a new generation of their Multi-Pixel Photon\nCounters in 2013 with significantly reduced after-pulsing rate. In this paper,\nwe investigate the causes of after-pulsing by testing pre-2013 and post-2013\ndevices using laser light ranging from 405 to 820nm. Doing so we investigate\nthe possibility that afterpulsing is also due to optical photons produced in\nthe avalanche rather than to impurities trapping charged carriers produced in\nthe avalanches and releasing them at a later time. For pre-2013 devices, we\nobserve avalanches delayed by ns to several 100~ns at 637, 777nm and 820 nm\ndemonstrating that holes created in the zero field region of the silicon bulk\ncan diffuse back to the high field region triggering delayed avalanches. On the\nother hand post-2013 exhibit no delayed avalanches beyond 100~ns at 777nm. We\nalso confirm that post-2013 devices exhibit about 25 times lower after-pulsing.\nTaken together, our measurements show that the absorption of photons from the\navalanche in the bulk of the silicon and the subsequent hole diffusion back to\nthe junction was a significant source of after-pulse for the pre-2013 devices.\nHamamatsu appears to have fixed this problem in 2013 following the preliminary\nrelease of our results. We also show that even at short wavelength the timing\ndistribution exhibit tails in the sub-nanosecond range that may impair the MPPC\ntiming performances.\n", "  We discuss Yukawa-enhanced contributions from $Z$-mediated new physics to\ndown-type quark $\\Delta F=2$ processes in the framework of the standard model\ngauge-invariant effective theory (SMEFT). Besides the renormalization group\n(RG) mixing of the $Z$-mediating $\\psi^2 H^2 D$ operators into $\\Delta F = 2$\noperators, we include at the electroweak scale one-loop (NLO) matching\ncorrections consistently, necessary for the removal of the matching scale\ndependence. We point out that the right-handed $Z$-mediated interactions\ngenerate through Yukawa RG mixing $\\Delta F=2$ left-right operators, which are\nfurther enhanced through QCD RG effects and chirally enhanced hadronic matrix\nelements. We investigate the impact of these new effects on the known\ncorrelations between $\\Delta F=2$ and $\\Delta F=1$ transitions in the SMEFT\nframework and point out qualitative differences to previous parameterizations\nof $Z$-mediated new physics that arise for the left-handed case. We illustrate\nhow specific models fit into our model-independent framework by using four\nmodels with vector-like quarks. We carry out model-independent analyses of\nscenarios with purely left-handed and purely right-handed new-physics $Z$\ncouplings for each of the three sectors $s\\to d$, $b\\to s$ and $b\\to d$.\nSpecifically we discuss the correlations between $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$,\n$\\varepsilon_K$, $K_L\\to \\mu^+\\mu^-$ $K^+\\to \\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and\n$K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$ in the Kaon sector, and $\\phi_s$, $B_s\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$\nand $B\\to K^{(*)} (\\mu^+\\mu^-, \\nu\\bar\\nu)$ in the $b\\to s$ sector and\n$B_d\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ in the $b\\to d$ sector.\n", "  We provide hadronic input for the $B$-meson semileptonic transitions to a\nlight pseudoscalar meson at large recoil. The $B_s\\to K$ form factor calculated\nfrom QCD light-cone sum rule is updated, to be used for a $|V_{ub}|$\ndetermination from the $B_s\\to K \\ell \\nu$ width. Furthermore, we calculate the\nhadronic input for the binned observables of $B \\to \\pi \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ and $B\n\\to K \\ell^+ \\ell^-$. In addition to the form factors, the nonlocal hadronic\nmatrix elements are obtained, combining QCD factorization and light-cone sum\nrules with hadronic dispersion relations. We emphasize that, due to nonlocal\neffects, the ratio of branching fractions of these decays is not sufficient for\nan accurate extraction of the $|V_{td}/V_{ts}|$ ratio. Instead, we suggest to\ndetermine the Wolfenstein parameters $A,\\rho,\\eta$ of the CKM matrix, combining\nthe branching fractions of $B \\to K \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ and $B \\to \\pi \\ell^+\n\\ell^-$ with the direct $CP$-asymmetry in the latter decay. We also obtain the\nhadronic matrix elements for a yet unexplored channel $B_s \\to K \\ell^+\n\\ell^-$.\n", "  The physical world is quantum. However, our description of the quantum\nphysics still relies much on concepts in classical physics and in some cases\nwith `quantized' interpretations. The most important case example is that of\nspacetime. We examine the picture of the physical space as described by simple,\nso-called non-relativisitic, quantum mechanics instead of assuming the\nNewtonian model. The key perspective is that of (relativity) symmetry\nrepresentation, and the idea that the physical space is to be identified as the\nconfiguration space for a free particle. Parallel to the case of the phase\nspace, we have a model of the quantum physical space which reduces to the\nNewtonian classical model under the classical limit. The latter is to be\nobtained as a contraction limit of the relativity symmetry.\n", "  In the Standard Model (SM), flavour changing neutral current (FCNC) top\ndecays, possible at loop level only, are very strongly suppressed. Observation\nof any such decay would be a direct signature of physics beyond the SM. Large\nenhancements are possible in many \"new physics\" scenarios and the largest\nenhancement is in most cases expected for the $t\\rightarrow cH$ decay. A full\nstudy for CLIC was based on the WHIZARD simulation of FCNC top decays within\nthe 2HDM(III) model. Beam polarization and beam-induced background were taken\ninto account. Top pair production events with the FCNC decay $t\\rightarrow cH$\ncan be identified based on kinematic constrains and flavour tagging\ninformation. Due to a large overlap in the kinematic space with standard top\npair events, the final signal selection-efficiency is small, at the 10% level.\nExpected limits on $BR(t\\rightarrow cH)\\times BR(H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b})$ are\ncompared with earlier results based on parton level simulation.\n", "  Model builders often need to find the most general Lagrangian which can be\nconstructed from a given list of fields. These fields are actually\nrepresentations of the Lorentz and gauge groups (and maybe of some discrete\nsymmetry group as well). I will describe a simple program (Sym2Int) which helps\nto automate this task by listing all possible interactions between\nLorentz/gauge group representations.\n", "  The study of topology in solids is undergoing a renaissance following renewed\ninterest in the properties of ferroic domain walls as well as recent\ndiscoveries regarding topological insulators and skyrmionic lattices. Each of\nthese systems possess a property that is `protected' in a symmetry sense, and\nis defined rigorously using a branch of mathematics known as topology. In this\narticle we review the formal definition of topological defects as they are\nclassified in terms of homotopy theory, and discuss the precise\nsymmetry-breaking conditions that lead to their formation. We distinguish\ntopological defects from geometric defects, which arise from the details of the\nstacking or structure of the material but are not protected by symmetry. We\nprovide simple material examples of both topological and geometric defect\ntypes, and discuss the implications of the classification on the resulting\nmaterial properties.\n", "  ATLAS and CMS have observed a flavor violating decay of the Higgs to muon and\ntau. The fact that flavour violating couplings of the Higgs boson are exactly\nzero in the Standard Model suggests the mixing of the Higgs with another scalar\nwith flavour violating couplings. We use the flavon field from the\nFroggatt-Nielsen mechanism, responsible for generating the lepton Yukawa\nmatrices, for this purpose. The parameter space is constrained from\nexperimental bounds on charged lepton flavor violation in other processes,\nhowever, we show that a substantial region of parameter space survives these\nbounds while producing a large enough $Br(h \\to\\mu\\tau)$.\n", "  Phase response curve (PRC) is an extremely useful tool for studying the\nresponse of oscillatory systems, e.g. neurons, to sparse or weak stimulation.\nHere we develop a framework for studying the response to a series of pulses\nwhich are frequent or/and strong so that the standard PRC fails. We show that\nin this case, the phase shift caused by each pulse depends on the history of\nseveral previous pulses. We call the corresponding function which measures this\nshift the phase response function (PRF). As a result of the introduction of the\nPRF, a variety of oscillatory systems with pulse interaction, such as neural\nsystems, can be reduced to phase systems. The main assumption of the classical\nPRC model, i.e. that the effect of the stimulus vanishes before the next one\narrives, is no longer a restriction in our approach. However, as a result of\nthe phase reduction, the system acquires memory, which is not just a technical\nnuisance but an intrinsic property relevant to strong stimulation. We\nillustrate the PRF approach by its application to various systems, such as\nMorris-Lecar, Hodgkin-Huxley neuron models, and others. We show that the PRF\nallows predicting the dynamics of forced and coupled oscillators even when the\nPRC fails.\n", "  This a pedagogical introduction to scattering amplitudes in gauge theories.\nIt proceeds from Dirac equation and Weyl fermions to the two pivot points of\ncurrent developments: the recursion relations of Britto, Cachazo, Feng and\nWitten, and the unitarity cut method pioneered by Bern, Dixon, Dunbar and\nKosower. In ten lectures, it covers the basic elements of on-shell methods.\n", "  As the LHC Higgs data persistently suggest the couplings of the observed 125\nGeV Higgs boson to be consistent with the Standard Model (SM) expectations, any\nextended Higgs sector must lead to the so-called SM alignment limit, where one\nof the Higgs bosons behaves exactly like that of the SM. In the context of the\nTwo Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), this alignment is often associated with either\ndecoupling of the heavy Higgs sector or accidental cancellations in the 2HDM\npotential. We present a novel symmetry justification for `natural' alignment\nwithout necessarily decoupling or fine-tuning. We show that there exist only\nthree different symmetry realizations of the natural alignment scenario in\n2HDM. We identify the 2HDM parameter space satisfying the natural alignment\ncondition up to the Planck scale. We also analyze new collider signals for the\nheavy Higgs sector in the natural alignment limit, which dominantly lead to\nthird-generation quarks in the final state and can serve as a useful\nobservational tool during the Run-II phase of the LHC.\n", "  CP-odd invariants are useful for studying the CP properties of Lagrangians in\nany basis. We explain how to build basis invariants for the scalar sector, and\nhow to distinguish CP-odd invariants from CP-even invariants. Up to a certain\norder, we use these methods to systematically build all the CP-odd invariants.\nThe CP-odd invariants signal either explicit or spontaneous violation of CP.\nMaking use of the CP-odd invariants, we determine the CP properties of\npotentials with 3 and with 6 Higgs fields arranged as triplets of specific\ndiscrete symmetries in the $\\Delta(3n^2)$ or $\\Delta(6n^2)$ series (inlcuding\n$A_4$, $S_4$, $\\Delta(27)$ and $\\Delta(54)$ as well as the cases for $n>3$).\n", "  We continue the investigation of F-term axion monodromy inflation in string\ntheory, while seriously taking the issue of moduli stabilization into account.\nFor a number of closed and open string models, we show that they suffer from\nserious control issues once one is trying to realize trans-Planckian field\nexcursions. More precisely, the flux tuning required to delay the logarithmic\nscaling of the field distance to a trans-Planckian value cannot be done without\nleaving the regime where the employed effective supergravity theory is under\ncontrol. Our findings are consistent with the axionic extension of the Refined\nSwampland Conjecture, stating that in quantum gravity the effective theory\nbreaks down for a field excursion beyond the Planck scale. Our analysis\nsuggests that models of F-term axion monodromy inflation with a\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r\\ge O(10^{-3})$ cannot be parametrically controlled.\n", "  We characterize general non-Markovian Gaussian maps which are covariant under\nGalilean transformations. In particular, we characterize translational and\nGalilean covariant maps and show that they reduce to the known Holevo result in\nthe Markovian limit. We apply the results to discuss measures of macroscopicity\nbased on classicalization maps, specifically addressing dissipation, Galilean\ncovariance and non-Markovianity. We further suggest a possible generalization\nof the macroscopicity measure defined in Nimmrichter and Hornbergerl. [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 110, 16 (2013)].\n", "  We discuss the prospects for charged Higgs boson searches at the LHC, within\nthe two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM). The 2HDM is generally less constrained\nthan the corresponding sector of the MSSM, but there are still severe\ntheoretical and experimental constraints that already exclude significant\nregions of the naive parameter space. Explicit searches in the\n$H^+\\to\\tau^+\\nu$ and $H^+\\to t\\bar b$ channels are further restricting parts\nof the 2HDM parameter space.\n", "  Some anomalies in the processes $b\\to s\\ell\\ell$ ($\\ell=\\mu,e$) and $b\\to c\n\\ell\\bar\\nu_\\ell$ ($\\ell=\\tau,\\mu,e$), in particular in the observables $R_K$\nand $R_{D^{(\\ast)}}$, have been found by the BaBar, LHCb and Belle\nCollaborations, leading to a possible lepton flavor universality violation. If\nthese anomalies were confirmed they would inevitably lead to physics beyond the\nStandard Model. In this paper we try to accommodate the present anomalies in an\nextra dimensional theory, solving the naturalness problem of the Standard Model\nby means of a warped metric with a strong conformality violation near the\ninfra-red brane. The $R_K$ anomaly can be accommodated provided that the\nleft-handed bottom quark and muon lepton have some degree of compositeness in\nthe dual theory. The theory is consistent with all electroweak and flavor\nobservables, and with all direct searches of Kaluza-Klein electroweak gauge\nbosons and gluons. The fermion spectrum, and fermion mixing angles, can be\nreproduced by mostly elementary right-handed bottom quarks, and tau and muon\nleptons. Moreover the $R_{D^{(\\ast)}}$ anomaly requires a strong degree of\ncompositeness for the left-handed tau leptons, which turns out to be in tension\nwith experimental data on the $g_{\\tau_L}^Z$ coupling, possibly unless some\ndegree of fine-tuning is introduced in the fixing of the CKM matrix.\n", "  We study the compression and extension dynamics of a DNA-like polymer\ninteracting with non-DNA binding and DNA-binding proteins, by means of computer\nsimulations. The geometry we consider is inspired by recent experiments probing\nthe compressional elasticity of the bacterial nucleoid (DNA plus associated\nproteins), where DNA is confined into a cylindrical container and subjected to\nthe action of a \"piston\" - a spherical bead to which an external force is\napplied. We quantify the effect of steric interactions (excluded volume) on the\nforce-extension curves as the polymer is compressed. We find that\nnon-DNA-binding proteins, even at low densities, exert an osmotic force which\ncan be a lot larger than the entropic force exerted by the compressed DNA. The\ntrends we observe are qualitatively robust with respect to changes in protein\nsize, and are similar for neutral and charged proteins (and DNA). We also\nquantify the dynamics of DNA expansion following removal of the \"piston\": while\nthe expansion is well fitted by power laws, the apparent exponent depends on\nprotein concentration, and protein-DNA interaction in a significant way. We\nfurther highlight an interesting kinetic process which we observe during the\nexpansion of DNA interacting with DNA-binding proteins when the interaction\nstrength is intermediate: the proteins bind while the DNA is packaged by the\ncompression force, but they \"pop-off\" one-by-one as the force is removed,\nleading to a slow unzipping kinetics. Finally, we quantify the importance of\nsupercoiling, which is an important feature of bacterial DNA in vivo.\n", "  We proposed the generalized holographic dark energy model where infrared\ncutoff is identified with the combination of the FRW universe parameters: the\nHubble rate, particle and future horizons, cosmological constant, the universe\nlife-time (if finite) and their derivatives. It is demonstrated that with the\ncorresponding choice of the cutoff one can map such holographic dark energy to\nmodified gravity or gravity with general fluid. Explicitly, F(R) gravity and\ngeneral perfect fluid are worked out in detail and corresponding infrared\ncutoff is found. Using this correspondence, we get realistic inflation or\nviable dark energy or unified inflationary-dark energy universe in terms of\ncovariant holographic dark energy.\n", "  We present results from a detailed spectral-timing analysis of a long ~486 ks\nXMM-Newton observation of the bare Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 120 which showed\nalternating diminution and increment in the 0.3-10 keV X-ray flux over four\nconsecutive orbits in 2014. We study the energy-dependent variability of Ark\n120 through broad-band X-ray spectroscopy, fractional root-mean-squared (rms)\nspectral modelling, hardness-intensity diagram and flux-flux analysis. The\nX-ray (0.3-10 keV) spectra are well fitted by a thermally Comptonized primary\ncontinuum with two (blurred and distant) reflection components and an optically\nthick, warm Comptonization component for the soft X-ray excess emission below\n~2 keV. During the first and third observations, the fractional X-ray\nvariability amplitude decreases with energy while for second and fourth\nobservations, X-ray variability spectra are found to be inverted-crescent and\ncrescent shaped respectively. The rms variability spectra are well modelled by\ntwo constant reflection components, a soft excess component with variable\nluminosity and a variable intrinsic continuum with the normalization and\nspectral slope being correlated. The spectral softening of the source with both\nthe soft excess and UV luminosities favour Comptonization models where the soft\nexcess and primary X-ray emission are produced through Compton up-scattering of\nthe UV and UV/soft X-ray seed photons in the putative warm and hot coronae,\nrespectively. Our analyses imply that the observed energy-dependent variability\nof Ark 120 is most likely due to variations in the spectral shape and\nluminosity of the hot corona and to variations in the luminosity of the warm\ncorona, both of which are driven by variations in the seed photon flux.\n", "  Random tensor networks provide useful models that incorporate various\nimportant features of holographic duality. A tensor network is usually defined\nfor a fixed graph geometry specified by the connection of tensors. In this\npaper, we generalize the random tensor network approach to allow quantum\nsuperposition of different spatial geometries. We set up a framework in which\nall possible bulk spatial geometries, characterized by weighted adjacent\nmatrices of all possible graphs, are mapped to the boundary Hilbert space and\nform an overcomplete basis of the boundary. We name such an overcomplete basis\nas holographic coherent states. A generic boundary state can be expanded on\nthis basis, which describes the state as a superposition of different spatial\ngeometries in the bulk. We discuss how to define distinct classical geometries\nand small fluctuations around them. We show that small fluctuations around\nclassical geometries define \"code subspaces\" which are mapped to the boundary\nHilbert space isometrically with quantum error correction properties. In\naddition, we also show that the overlap between different geometries is\nsuppressed exponentially as a function of the geometrical difference between\nthe two geometries. The geometrical difference is measured in an area law\nfashion, which is a manifestation of the holographic nature of the states\nconsidered.\n", "  Nonperturbative effects in the quark-gluon thermodynamics are studied in the\nframework of Vacuum Correlator Method. It is shown, that two correlators:\ncolorelectric $D_1^E(x)$ and colormagnetic $D^H(x)$, provide the Polyakov line\nand the colormagnetic confinement in the spatial planes respectively. As a\nresult both effects produce the realistic behavior of $P(T)$ and $s(T)$, being\nin good agreement with numerical lattice data.\n", "  We examine the heterogeneous responses of individual nodes in sparse networks\nto the random removal of a fraction of edges. Using the message-passing\nformulation of percolation, we discover considerable variation across the\nnetwork in the probability of a particular node to remain part of the giant\ncomponent, and in the expected size of small clusters containing that node. In\nthe vicinity of the percolation threshold, weakly non-linear analysis reveals\nthat node-to-node heterogeneity is captured by the recently introduced notion\nof non-backtracking centrality. We supplement these results for fixed finite\nnetworks by a population dynamics approach to analyse random graph models in\nthe infinite system size limit, also providing closed-form approximations for\nthe large mean degree limit of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs. Interpreted in\nterms of the application of percolation to real-world processes, our results\nshed light on the heterogeneous exposure of different nodes to cascading\nfailures, epidemic spread, and information flow.\n", "  A joint theoretical and experimental investigation is performed to understand\nthe underlying physics of laser-induced demagnetization in Ni and Co films.\nExperimentally dynamics of spins is studied by determining the time-dependent\namplitude of the Voigt vector and theoretically ab-initio calculations are\nperformed using time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate that\noverall spin-orbit induced spin-flips are the most significant contributors\nwith super-diffusive spin transport playing very limited to no role. Our study\nhighlights the material dependent nature of the demagnetization during the\nprocess of thermalization of non-equilibrium spins.\n", "  The VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC) began observations in\n2009 and since then, it has collected multi-epoch data at Ks and in addition\nmulti-band data in Y and J for a wide range of stellar populations across the\nMagellanic system. Among them are pulsating variable stars: Cepheids, RR Lyrae,\nand asymptotic giant branch stars that represent useful tracers of the host\nsystem geometry.\n", "  By performing X-rays measurements in the \"cosmic silence\" of the underground\nlaboratory of Gran Sasso, LNGS-INFN, we test a basic principle of quantum\nmechanics: the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP), for electrons. We present the\nachieved results of the VIP experiment and the ongoing VIP2 measurement aiming\nto gain two orders of magnitude improvement in testing PEP. We also use a\nsimilar experimental technique to search for radiation (X and gamma) predicted\nby continuous spontaneous localization models, which aim to solve the\n\"measurement problem\".\n", "  We consider SUSY-like events with two decay chains, each terminating in an\ninvisible particle, whose true energy and momentum are not measured in the\ndetector. Nevertheless, a useful educated guess about the invisible momenta can\nstill be obtained by optimizing a suitable invariant mass function. We review\nand contrast several proposals in the literature for such ansatze: four\nversions of the M_T2-assisted on-shell reconstruction (MAOS), as well as\nseveral variants of the on-shell constrained M_2 variables. We compare the\nperformance of these methods with regards to the mass determination of a new\nparticle resonance along the decay chain from the peak of the reconstructed\ninvariant mass distribution. For concreteness, we consider the event topology\nof dilepton ttbar events and study each of the three possible subsystems, in\nboth a ttbar and a SUSY example. We find that the M_2 variables generally\nprovide sharper peaks and therefore better ansatze for the invisible momenta.\nWe show that the performance can be further improved by preselecting events\nnear the kinematic endpoint of the corresponding variable from which the\nmomentum ansatz originates.\n", "  The masses and residues of the radially excited heavy $\\Omega_c^{0}$ and $\n\\Omega_b^{-}$ baryons with spin-parity $J^{P}=\\frac{1}{2}^{+}$ and $J^{P}=\n\\frac{3}{2}^{+}$ are calculated by means of QCD two-point sum rule method using\nthe general form of their interpolating currents. In calculations the quark,\ngluon and mixed vacuum condensates up to ten dimensions are taken into account.\nIn $\\Omega_c^{0}$ channel a comparison is made with the narrow excited states\nrecently observed by the LHCb Collaboration.\n", "  We investigate whether the triple-parton scattering effects can be observed\nin open charm production in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. We use\nso-called factorized Ansatz for calculations of hard multiple-parton\ninteractions. The numerical results for each parton interaction are obtained\nwithin the $k_{T}$-factorization approach. Predictions for one, two and three\n$c\\bar c$ pairs production are given for $\\sqrt{s}= 7$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s}= 13$\nTeV. Quite large cross sections, of the order of milibarns, for the\ntriple-parton scattering mechanism are obtained. We suggest a measurement of\nthree $D^{0}$ mesons or three $\\bar{D^{0}}$ antimesons by the LHCb\ncollaboration. Confronting our results with recent LHCb experimental data for\nsingle and double $D^{0}$ (or $\\bar{D^{0}}$) meson production we present our\npredictions for triple meson final state: $D^{0}D^{0}D^{0}$ or\n$\\bar{D^{0}}\\bar{D^{0}}\\bar{D^{0}}$. We present cross sections for the LHCb\nfiducial volume as well as distributions for $D^{0}$ meson transverse momentum\nand three-$D^{0}$ meson invariant mass. The predicted visible cross sections,\nincluding the detector acceptance, hadronization effects and $c \\to D^{0}$\nbranching fraction, is of the order of a few nanobarns. The counting rates\nincluding $D^{0} \\to K^{-}\\pi^{+}$ branching fractions are given for known or\nexpected integrated luminosities.\n", "  There is a growing interest since the 1990s to understand the squeezing and\nshear behaviors of liquid films at nanometer scale by the atomic force\nmicroscope (AFM) measurement. We carry out all-atom contact-mode AFM\nsimulations in a liquid-vapor molecular dynamics ensemble to investigate the\nsolvation force oscillation and squeeze out mechanisms of a confined linear\ndodecane fluid between a gold AFM tip and a mica substrate. Solvation force\noscillations are found to be associated with the layering transition of liquid\nfilm and unstable jumps of AFM tip position. Detailed structural analyses and\nmolecular animations show that the local permeation of chain molecules and the\nsqueeze out of molecules near the edge of contact promote the layering\ntransition under compression. The confinement-induced slow down dynamics is\nmanifested by the decrease in diffusivity and increase in rotational relaxation\ntimes. However, the persistent diffusive behavior of dodecane chain molecules\neven in the single-monolayer film is attributed to the chain sliding motions,\ngiven the fact that substantial vacancy space exists in the film due to thermal\nfluctuations.\n", "  We present our project to calibrate the RR Lyrae\nperiod-luminosity-metallicity relation using a sample of Galactic calibrators\nin the halo and globular clusters.\n", "  We propose an approach to DGLAP evolution at small x that circumvents the\nusual problem that a perturbation expansion is not valid there. The data for\nthe charm structure function are important to motivate the method, and it\ndescribes them much more successfully than the conventional approach.\n", "  For planar integrable billiards, the eigenstates can be classified with\nrespect to a quantity determined by the quantum numbers. Given the quantum\nnumbers as $m, n$, the index which represents a class is $c = m\\, \\mbox{mod}\\,\nk\\,n$ for a natural number, $k$. We show here that the entire tower of states\ncan be generated from an initially given state by application of the operators\nintroduced here. Thus, these operators play the same role for billiards as\nraising and lowering operators in angular momentum algebra.\n", "  A new simplified formula is derived for the absorption cross section of small\ndielectric ellipsoidal particles embedded in lossy media. The new expression\nleads directly to a closed form solution for the optimal conjugate match with\nrespect to the surrounding medium, i.e., the optimal permittivity of the\nellipsoidal particle that maximizes the absorption at any given frequency. This\ndefines the optimal plasmonic resonance for the ellipsoid. The optimal\nconjugate match represents a metamaterial in the sense that the corresponding\noptimal permittivity function may have negative real part (inductive\nproperties), and can not in general be implemented as a passive material over a\ngiven bandwidth. A necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the\nfeasibility of tuning the Drude model to the optimal conjugate match at a\nsingle frequency, and it is found that all the prolate spheroids and some of\nthe (not too flat) oblate spheroids can be tuned into optimal plasmonic\nresonance at any desired center frequency. Numerical examples are given to\nillustrate the analysis. Except for the general understanding of plasmonic\nresonances in lossy media, it is also anticipated that the new results can be\nuseful for feasibility studies with e.g., the radiotherapeutic hyperthermia\nbased methods to treat cancer based on electrophoretic heating in gold\nnanoparticle suspensions using microwave radiation.\n", "  The problem of a relativistic bound-state system consisting of two scalar\nbosons interacting through the exchange of another scalar boson, in 2+1\nspace-time dimensions, has been studied. The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) was\nsolved by adopting the Nakanishi integral representation (NIR) and the\nLight-Front projection. The NIR allows us to solve the BSE in Minkowski space,\nwhich is a big and important challenge, since most of non-perturbative\ncalculations are done in Euclidean space, e.g. Lattice and Schwinger-Dyson\ncalculations. We have in this work adopted an interaction kernel containing the\nladder and cross-ladder exchanges. In order to check that the NIR is also a\ngood representation in 2+1, the coupling constants and Wick-rotated amplitudes\nhave been computed and compared with calculations performed in Euclidean space.\nVery good agreement between the calculations performed in the Minkowski and\nEuclidean spaces has been found. This is an important consistence test that\nallows Minkowski calculations with the Nakanishi representation in 2+1\ndimensions. This relativistic approach will allow us to perform applications in\ncondensed matter problems in a near future.\n", "  We study two-body decays of a new neutral pseudoscalar into gauge bosons\nwithin the context of the Littlest Higgs model. Concretely, the $\\Phi^P \\to WW,\nVV, gg$ processes induced at the one-loop level, with $V=\\gamma, Z$, are\nconsidered. Since the branching ratios of the $\\Phi^P \\to VV$ decays result\nvery suppressed, only the $\\Phi^P \\to WW, gg$ processes are thoroughly studied.\nThe branching ratios for the $\\Phi^P \\to gg$ and $\\Phi^P \\to WW$ decays are of\nthe order of $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-6}$, respectively, for $f$ around 2 TeV, which\nrepresents the global symmetry breaking scale of the theory. The production\ncross section of the $\\Phi^P$ boson via gluon fusion at LHC is estimated.\n", "  Using a (1+2)-dimensional boson-vortex duality between non-linear\nelectrodynamics and a two-component compressible Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)\nwith spin-orbit (SO) coupling, we obtain generalised versions of the\nhydrodynamic continuity and Euler equations where the phase defect and\nnon-defect degrees of freedom enter separately. We obtain the generalised\nMagnus force on vortices under SO coupling, and associate the linear\nconfinement of vortices due to SO coupling with instanton fluctuations of the\ndual theory.\n", "  One of the most robust methods, demonstrated up to date, of accelerating\nelectron beams by laser-plasma sources is the utilization of plasma channels\ngenerated by the capillary discharges. These channels, i.e., plasma columns\nwith a minimum density along the laser pulse propagation axis, may optically\nguide short laser pulses, thereby increasing the acceleration length, leading\nto a more efficient electron acceleration. Although the spatial structure of\nthe installation is simple in principle, there may be some important effects\ncaused by the open ends of the capillary, by the supplying channels etc., which\nrequire a detailed 3D modeling of the processes taking place in order to get a\ndetailed understanding and improve the operation. However, the discharge\nplasma, being one of the most crucial components of the laser-plasma\naccelerator, is not simulated with the accuracy and resolution required to\nadvance this promising technology. In the present work, such simulations are\nperformed using the code MARPLE. First, the process of the capillary filling\nwith a cold hydrogen before the discharge is fired, through the side supply\nchannels is simulated. The main goal of this simulation is to get a spatial\ndistribution of the filling gas in the region near the open ends of the\ncapillary. A realistic geometry is used for this and the next stage\nsimulations, including the insulators, the supplying channels as well as the\nelectrodes. Second, the simulation of the capillary discharge is performed with\nthe goal to obtain a time-dependent spatial distribution of the electron\ndensity near the open ends of the capillary as well as inside the capillary.\nFinally, to evaluate effectiveness of the beam coupling with the channeling\nplasma wave guide and electron acceleration, modeling of laser-plasma\ninteraction was performed with the code INF&RNO\n", "  With the discovery of the first transiting extrasolar planetary system back\nto 1999, a great number of projects started to hunt for other similar systems.\nBecause of the incidence rate of such systems was unknown and the length of the\nshallow transit events is only a few percent of the orbital period, the goal\nwas to monitor continuously as many stars as possible for at least a period of\na few months. Small aperture, large field of view automated telescope systems\nhave been installed with a parallel development of new data reduction and\nanalysis methods, leading to better than 1% per data point precision for\nthousands of stars. With the successful launch of the photometric satellites\nCoRot and Kepler, the precision increased further by one-two orders of\nmagnitude. Millions of stars have been analyzed and searched for transits. In\nthe history of variable star astronomy this is the biggest undertaking so far,\nresulting in photometric time series inventories immensely valuable for the\nwhole field. In this review we briefly discuss the methods of data analysis\nthat were inspired by the main science driver of these surveys and highlight\nsome of the most interesting variable star results that impact the field of\nvariable star astronomy.\n", "  The talk summarises work done by the authors consisting of a detailed study\nof the possible vacua in models with three Higgs doublets with $S_3$ symmetry\nand without explicit CP violation. Different vacua require special regions of\nthe parameter space which were analysed in our work. We establish the\npossibility of spontaneous CP violation in this framework and we also show\nwhich complex vacua conserve CP. In our work we discussed constraints from\nvacuum stability. The results presented here are relevant for model building.\n", "  We compute the leading-order evolution of parton distribution functions for\nall the Standard Model fermions and bosons up to energy scales far above the\nelectroweak scale, where electroweak symmetry is restored. Our results include\nthe 52 PDFs of the unpolarized proton, evolving according to the SU(3), SU(2),\nU(1), mixed SU(2) x U(1) and Yukawa interactions. We illustrate the numerical\neffects on parton distributions at large energies, and show that this can lead\nto important corrections to parton luminosities at a future 100 TeV collider.\n", "  Small non-coding RNAs can exert significant regulatory activity on gene\nexpression in bacteria. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in\nunderstanding bacterial gene expression by sRNAs. However, recent findings that\ndemonstrate that families of mRNAs show non-trivial sub-cellular distributions\nraise the question of how localization may affect the regulatory activity of\nsRNAs. Here we address this question within a simple mathematical model. We\nshow that the non-uniform spatial distributions of mRNA can alter the\nthreshold-linear response that characterizes sRNAs that act stoichiometrically,\nand modulate the hierarchy among targets co-regulated by the same sRNA. We also\nidentify conditions where the sub-cellular organization of cofactors in the\nsRNA pathway can induce spatial heterogeneity on sRNA targets. Our results\nsuggest that under certain conditions, interpretation and modeling of natural\nand synthetic gene regulatory circuits need to take into account the spatial\norganization of the transcripts of participating genes.\n", "  We consider Pauli--Dirac fermion submitted to an inhomogeneous magnetic\nfield. It is showed that the propagator of the neutral Dirac particle with an\nanomalous magnetic moment in an external linear magnetic field is the causal\nGreen function $S^{c}(x_{b},x_{a})$ of the Pauli--Dirac equation. The\ncorresponding Green function is calculated via path integral method in global\nprojection, giving rise to the exact eigenspinors expressions. The neutral\nparticle creation probability corresponding to our system is analyzed, which is\nobtained as function of the introduced field $B'$ and the additional spin\nmagnetic moment $\\mu$.\n", "  We study a noisy Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation which describes unstable\nsurface growth and chemical turbulence. It has been conjectured that the\nuniversal long-wavelength behavior of the equation, which is characterized by\nscale-dependent parameters, is described by a Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)\nequation. We consider this conjecture by analyzing a renormalization-group\nequation for a class of generalized KPZ equations. We then uniquely determine\nthe parameter values of the KPZ equation that most effectively describes the\nuniversal long-wavelength behavior of the noisy KS equation.\n", "  We study rapidly rotating hybrid stars with the Dyson-Schwinger model for\nquark matter and the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock many-body theory with realistic\ntwo-body and three-body forces for nuclear matter. We determine the maximum\ngravitational mass, equatorial radius, and rotation frequency of stable stellar\nconfigurations by considering the constraints of the Keplerian limit and the\nsecular axisymmetric instability, and compare with observational data. We also\ndiscuss the rotational evolution for constant baryonic mass, and find a spinup\nphenomenon for supramassive stars before they collapse to black holes.\n", "  We report on the first fully differential calculation for $W^\\pm Z$\nproduction in hadron collisions up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in\nQCD perturbation theory. Leptonic decays of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons are\nconsistently taken into account, i.e. we include all resonant and non-resonant\ndiagrams that contribute to the process $pp\\to \\ell^{'\\pm} \\nu_{\\ell^{'}}\n\\ell^+\\ell^-+X$ both in the same-flavour ($\\ell'=\\ell$) and the\ndifferent-flavour ($\\ell'\\neq \\ell$) channel. Fiducial cross sections and\ndistributions are presented in the presence of standard selection cuts applied\nin the experimental $W^\\pm Z$ analyses by ATLAS and CMS at centre-of-mass\nenergies of 8 and 13\\,TeV. As previously shown for the inclusive cross section,\nNNLO corrections increase the NLO result by about $10\\%$, thereby leading to an\nimproved agreement with experimental data. The importance of NNLO accurate\npredictions is also shown in the case of new-physics scenarios, where,\nespecially in high-$p_T$ categories, their impact can reach ${\\cal O}(20\\%)$.\nThe availability of differential NNLO predictions will play a crucial role in\nthe rich physics programme that is based on precision studies of $W^\\pm Z$\nsignatures at the LHC.\n", "  Self-avoiding walks on the body-centered-cubic (BCC) and face-centered-cubic\n(FCC) lattices are enumerated up to lengths 28 and 24, respectively, using the\nlength-doubling method. Analysis of the enumeration results yields values for\nthe exponents $\\gamma$ and $\\nu$ which are in agreement with, but less accurate\nthan those obtained earlier from enumeration results on the simple cubic\nlattice. The non-universal growth constant and amplitudes are accurately\ndetermined, yielding for the BCC lattice $\\mu=6.530520(20)$, $A=1.1785(40)$,\nand $D=1.0864(50)$, and for the FCC lattice $\\mu=10.037075(20)$,\n$A=1.1736(24)$, and $D=1.0460(50)$.\n", "  In this note we report on the recent progress in the study of the strongly\ninteracting sector of the Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(MRSSM). First, we discuss the limits originating from the search of the sgluon\npair production in the same-sign lepton final state at the LHC. Next, we\npresent the first available in literature calculation of the NLO SQCD\ncorrections to the same-sign squark pair production in the MRSSM. We discuss\nthe relative size of $k$-factors compared to the MSSM and some technical\ndetails that led to this result.\n", "  We present density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the magnetic\nanisotropy energy (MAE) of FePt, which is of great interest for magnetic\nrecording applications. Our data, and the majority of previously calculated\nresults for perfectly ordered crystals, predict an MAE of $\\sim 3.0$ meV per\nformula unit, which is significantly larger than experimentally measured\nvalues. Analyzing the effects of disorder by introducing stacking faults (SFs)\nand anti site defects (ASDs) in varying concentrations we are able to reconcile\ncalculations with experimental data and show that even a low concentration of\nASDs are able to reduce the MAE of FePt considerably. Investigating the effect\nof exact exchange and electron correlation within the adiabatic-connection\ndissipation fluctuation theorem in the random phase approximation (ACDFT-RPA)\nreveals a significantly smaller influence on the MAE. Thus the effect of\ndisorder, and more specifically ASDs, is the crucial factor in explaining the\ndeviation of common DFT calculations of FePt to experimental measurements.\n", "  We investigate the spectral statistics of Hermitian matrices in which the\nelements are chosen uniformly from U (1), called the uni-modular ensemble\n(UME), in the limit of large matrix size. Using three complimentary methods; a\nsupersymmetric integration method, a combinatorial graph-theoretical analysis\nand a Brownian motion approach, we are able to derive expressions for 1/N\ncorrections to the mean spectral moments and also analyse the fluctuations\nabout this mean. By addressing the same ensemble from three different point of\nview, we can critically compare their relative advantages and derive some new\nresults.\n", "  The possible neutral $D^{(*)}\\bar{D}^{(*)}$ and $B^{(*)}\\bar{B}^{(*)}$\nmolecular states are studied in the framework of the constituent quark models,\nwhich is extended by including the $s$-channel one gluon exchange. Using\ndifferent types of quark-quark potentials, we solve the four-body\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation by means of the Gaussian expansion method. The bound\nstates of $D^{(*)}\\bar{D}^{(*)}$ with $J^{PC}=1^{++},2^{++}$ and\n$B^{(*)}\\bar{B}^{(*)}$ with $J^{PC}=0^{++},1^{+-},1^{++},2^{++}$ are obtained.\nThe molecular states $D^{*}\\bar{D}$ with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ and $B^{*}\\bar{B}$\nwith $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ are good candidates for the $X(3872)$ and $Z^0_b(10610)$,\nrespectively.\n", "  We have studied the $N^*(1875) (3/2^-)$ resonance with a multichannel unitary\nscheme, considering the $\\Delta \\pi$ and $\\Sigma^* K$, with their interaction\nextracted from chiral Lagrangians, and then have added two more channels, the\n$N^*(1535) \\pi$ and $N \\sigma$, which proceed via triangle diagrams involving\nthe $\\Sigma^* K$ and $\\Delta \\pi$ respectively in the intermediate states. The\ntriangle diagram in the $N^*(1535) \\pi$ case develops a singularity at the same\nenergy as the resonance mass. We determine the couplings of the resonance to\nthe different channels and the partial decay widths. We find a very large decay\nwidth to $\\Sigma^* K$, and also see that, due to interference with other terms,\nthe $N \\sigma$ channel has an important role in the $\\pi \\pi$ mass\ndistributions at low invariant masses, leading to an apparently large $N\n\\sigma$ decay width. A discussion is done, justifying the convenience of an\nexperimental reanalysis of this resonance to the light of the findings of the\npaper, using multichannel unitary schemes.\n", "  The paper describes the design of broadband chirp excitation pulses in NMR.\nWe first develop a three stage model for understanding chirp excitation in NMR.\nWe then show how a chirp $\\pi$ pulse can be used to refocus the phase of the\nchirp excitation pulse. The resulting magnetization still has some phase\ndispersion in it. We show how a combination of two chirp $\\pi$ pulses instead\nof one can be used to eliminate this dispersion, leaving behind a small\nresidual phase dispersion. The excitation pulse sequence presented here allow\nexciting arbitrary large bandwidths without increasing the peak rf-amplitude.\nAlthough methods presented in this paper have appeared elsewhere, we present\ncomplete analytical treatment that elucidates the working of these methods.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a classical disordered macroscopic model completely\nisolated from the environment reproducing, in a classical setting, the \"quantum\nquench\" protocol. We show that, depending on the pre and post quench parameters\nthe system approaches equilibrium, succeeding to act as a bath on itself, or\nremains out of equilibrium, in two different ways. In one of the latter, the\nsystem stays confined in a metastable state in which it undergoes stationary\ndynamics characterised by a single temperature. In the other, the system ages\nand its dynamics are characterised by two temperatures associated to\nobservations made at short and long time differences (high and low\nfrequencies). The parameter dependence of the asymptotic states is rationalised\nin terms of a dynamic phase diagram with one equilibrium and two out of\nequilibrium phases. Aspects of pre-thermalisation are observed and discussed.\nSimilarities and differences with the dynamics of the dissipative model are\nalso explained.\n", "  This submission is a comment on an article that had previously appeared in\nPhys. Rev. Lett.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic and the transport properties of diluted magnetic\nsemiconductors using a spin-fermion Monte-Carlo method on a 3D lattice in the\nintermediate coupling regime. The ferromagnetic transition temperature $T_c$\nshows an optimization behavior, first increases and then decreases, with\nrespect to the absolute carrier density $p_{abs}$ for a given magnetic impurity\nconcentration $x$, as seen in the experiment. Our calculations also show an\ninsulator-metal-insulator transition across the optimum $p_{abs}$ where the\n$T_c$ is maximum. Remarkably, the optimum $p_{abs}$ values lie in a narrow\nrange around 0.11 for all $x$ values and the ferromagnetic $T_c$ increases with\n$x$. We explain our results using the polaron percolation mechanism and outline\na new route to enhance the ferromagnetic transition temperature in experiments.\n", "  Leptonic rare decays of $B^0_{s,d}$ mesons offer a powerful tool to search\nfor physics beyond the Standard Model. The $B^0_{s}\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay has\nbeen observed at the Large Hadron Collider and the first measurement of the\neffective lifetime of this channel was presented, in accordance with the\nStandard Model. On the other hand, $B^0_{s}\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-$ and $B^0_{s}\\to\ne^+e^-$ have received considerably less attention: while LHCb has recently\nreported a first upper limit of $6.8\\times10^{-3}$ (95% C.L.) for the\n$B^0_s\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-$ branching ratio, the upper bound $2.8\\times 10^{-7}$\n(90% C.L.) for the branching ratio of $B^0_s\\to e^+e^-$ was reported by CDF\nback in 2009. We discuss the current status of the interpretation of the\nmeasurement of $B^0_{s}\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$, and explore the space for New-Physics\neffects in the other $B^0_{s,d}\\to\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decays in a scenario assuming\nflavour-universal Wilson coefficients of the relevant four-fermion operators.\nWhile the New-Physics effects are then strongly suppressed by the ratio\n$m_\\mu/m_\\tau$ of the lepton masses in $B^0_s\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-$, they are hugely\nenhanced by $m_\\mu/m_e$ in $B^0_s\\to e^+e^-$ and may result in a $B^0_s\\to\ne^+e^-$ branching ratio as large as about 5 times the one of\n$B^0_{s}\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$, which is about a factor of 20 below the CDF bound; a\nsimilar feature arises in $B^0_{d}\\to e^+e^-$. Consequently, it would be most\ninteresting to search for the $B^0_{s,d}\\to e^+e^-$ channels at the LHC and\nBelle II, which may result in an unambiguous signal for physics beyond the\nStandard Model.\n", "  We present the fabrication and characterization of transmon qubits formed\nfrom aluminum Josephson junctions on two different silicon-based substrates:\n(i) high-resistivity silicon (Si) and (ii) silicon-on-insulator (SOI). Key to\nthe qubit fabrication process is the use of an anhydrous hydrofluoric vapor\nprocess which removes silicon surface oxides without attacking aluminum, and in\nthe case of SOI substrates, selectively removes the lossy buried oxide\nunderneath the qubit region. For qubits with a transition frequency of\napproximately $5$GHz we find qubit lifetimes and coherence times comparable to\nthose attainable on sapphire substrates ($T_{1,\\text{Si}} = 27\\mu$s,\n$T_{2,\\text{Si}} = 6.6\\mu$s; $T_{1,\\text{SOI}} = 3.5\\mu$s, $T_{2,\\text{SOI}} =\n2.2\\mu$s). This qubit fabrication process in principle permits co-fabrication\nof silicon photonic and mechanical elements, providing a route towards\nchip-scale integration of electro-opto-mechanical transducers for quantum\nnetworking of superconducting microwave quantum circuits.\n", "  We propose nearly-optimal control strategies for changing states of a quantum\nsystem. We argue that quantum control optimization can be studied analytically\nwithin some protocol families that depend on a small set of parameters for\noptimization. This optimization strategy can be preferred in practice because\nit is physically transparent and does not lead to combinatorial complexity in\nmultistate problems. For demonstration, we design optimized control protocols\nthat achieve switching between orthogonal states of a naturally biased quantum\ntwo-level system.\n", "  We introduce an instrument for a wide spectrum of experiments on gravities\nother than our planet's. It is based on a large Atwood machine where one of the\nloads is a bucket equipped with a single board computer and different sensors.\nThe computer is able to detect the falling (or rising) and then the\nstabilization of the effective gravity and to trigger actuators depending on\nthe experiment. Gravities within the range 0.4 g to 1.2 g are easily achieved\nwith acceleration noise of the order of 0.01 g. Under Martian gravity we are\nable to perform experiments of approximately 1.5 seconds duration. The system\nincludes features such as WiFi and a web interface with tools for the setup,\nmonitor and the data analysis of the experiment. We briefly show a case study\nin testing the performance of a model Mars rover wheel in low gravities.\n", "  We study dark matter physics in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\nwith non-universal gaugino masses at the unification scale. In this scenario,\nthe specific ratio of wino and gluino masses realizes the electro-weak scale\nnaturally and achieves 125 GeV Higgs boson mass. Then, relatively light\nhiggsino is predicted and the lightest neutral particle, that is dominantly\ngiven by the neutral component of higgsino, is a good dark matter candidate.\nThe direct detection of the dark matter is sensitive to not only a higgsino\nmass but also gaugino masses significantly. The upcoming XENON1T experiment\nexcludes the parameter region where bino or gluino is lighter than about 2.5\nTeV if the higgsino and the gaugino mass parameters have same signs. We see\nthat the direct detection of dark matter gives stronger bound than the direct\nsearch at the LHC experiment when higgsino sizably contributes to the dark\nmatter abundance\n", "  We present a discussion of radiative decays $\\chi_{cJ}\\rightarrow\\gamma \\rho\n(\\omega, \\phi)$. The decay amplitudes are computed within the QCD factorisation\nframework. NRQCD has been used in the heavy meson sector as well as a collinear\nexpansion in order to describe the overlap with light mesons in the final\nstate. The colour-singlet contributions to all helicity amplitudes have been\ncomputed using the light-cone distribution amplitudes of twist-2 and twist-3.\nAll obtained expressions are well defined at least in the leading-order\napproximation. The colour-octet contributions have also been studied in the\nCoulomb limit in order to exhibit their scaling behaviour. In order to\nunderstand the relevance of the different contributions we perform numerical\nestimates using the colour-singlet contributions. For the $\\chi_{c1}\\rightarrow\n\\gamma V_\\perp$ decays, to vector mesons with transverse polarisation, we find\nthat the colour-singlet contribution potentially allows for a reliable\ndescription. On the other hand, for the $\\chi_{c1}\\rightarrow \\gamma V_\\Vert$\ndecays, to vector mesons with longitudinal polarisation, our finding indicate\nthat the colour-octet mechanism may be important for a good description. We\nexpect that more accurate measurements of the decay $\\chi_{c2}\\rightarrow\\gamma\nV_{\\perp,\\Vert} $ can help to better understand the mechanism of radiative\ndecays.\n", "  This article deals with two main topics. One is odd parity trace anomalies in\nWeyl fermion theories in a 4d curved background, the second is the introduction\nof axial gravity. The motivation for reconsidering the former is to clarify the\ntheoretical background underlying the approach and complete the calculation of\nthe anomaly. The reference is in particular to the difference between Weyl and\nmassless Majorana fermions and to the possible contributions from tadpole and\nseagull terms in the Feynman diagram approach. A first, basic, result of this\npaper is that a more thorough treatment, taking account of such additional\nterms { and using dimensional regularization}, confirms the earlier result. The\nintroduction of an axial symmetric tensor besides the usual gravitational\nmetric is instrumental to a different derivation of the same result using Dirac\nfermions, which are coupled not only to the usual metric but also to the\nadditional axial tensor. The action of Majorana and Weyl fermions can be\nobtained in two different limits of such a general configuration. The results\nobtained in this way confirm the previously obtained ones.\n", "  Two qubits form a quantum four-level system. The golden-rule based transition\nrates between these states are determined by the coupling of the qubits to\nnoise sources. We demonstrate that depending on whether the noise acting on the\ntwo qubits is correlated or not, these transitions are governed by different\nselection rules. In particular, we find that for fully correlated or\nanticorrelated noise, there is a protected state, and the dynamics of the\nsystem depends then on its initialization. For nearly (anti)correlated noise,\nthere is a long time scale determining the temporal evolution of the qubits. We\napply our results to a quantum Otto refrigerator based on two qubits coupled to\nhot and cold baths. Even in the case when the two qubits do not interact with\neach other, the cooling power of the refrigerator does not scale with the\nnumber ($=2$ here) of the qubits when there is strong correlation of noise\nacting on them.\n", "  A thin liquid film with non-zero curvature at its free surface spontaneously\nflows to reach a flat configuration, a process driven by Laplace pressure\ngradients and resisted by the liquid's viscosity. Inspired by recent progresses\non the dynamics of liquid droplets on soft substrates, we here study the\nrelaxation of a viscous film supported by an elastic foundation. Experiments\ninvolve thin polymer films on elastomeric substrates, where the dynamics of the\nliquid-air interface is monitored using atomic force microscopy. A theoretical\nmodel that describes the coupled evolution of the solid-liquid and the\nliquid-air interfaces is also provided. In this soft-levelling configuration,\nLaplace pressure gradients not only drive the flow, but they also induce\nelastic deformations on the substrate that affect the flow and the shape of the\nliquid-air interface itself. This process represents an original example of\nelastocapillarity that is not mediated by the presence of a contact line. We\ndiscuss the impact of the elastic contribution on the levelling dynamics and\nshow the departure from the classical self-similarities and power laws observed\nfor capillary levelling on rigid substrates.\n", "  We investigated the dependence of the seed [Ta/Pt, Ta/Au] and capping [Pt/Ta,\nAu/Ta] layers on spin pumping effect in the ferromagnetic 3 nm thick Co thin\nfilm using ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The data is fitted with Kittel\nequation to evaluate damping constant and g-factor. A strong dependence of seed\nand capping layers on spin pumping has been discussed. The value of damping\nconstant {alpha} is found to be relatively large i.e. 0.0326 for the\nTa{3}/Pt{3}/Co{3}/Pt{3}/Ta{3} {nm} multi-layer structure, while it is 0.0104\nfor Ta{3}/Co{3}/Ta{3} {nm}. Increase in {alpha} is observed due to Pt layer\nthat works as a good sink for spins due to high spin orbit coupling. In\naddition, we measured the effective spin conductance = 2.0e18 m-2 for the\ntrilayer structure Pt{3}/Co{3}/Pt{3} {nm} as a result of the enhancement in\n{alpha} relative to its bulk value. We observed that the evaluated g-factor\ndecreases as effective demagnetizing magnetic field increases in all the\nstudied samples. The azimuthal dependence of magnetic resonance field and line\nwidth showed relatively high anisotropy in the trilayer Ta{3}/Co{3}/Ta{3} {nm}\nstructure.\n", "  A normal conductor placed in good contact with a superconductor can inherit\nits remarkable electronic properties. This proximity effect microscopically\noriginates from the formation in the conductor of entangled electron-hole\nstates, called Andreev states. Spectroscopic studies of Andreev states have\nbeen performed in just a handful of systems. The unique geometry, electronic\nstructure and high mobility of graphene make it a novel platform for studying\nAndreev physics in two dimensions. Here we use a full van der Waals\nheterostructure to perform tunnelling spectroscopy measurements of the\nproximity effect in superconductor-graphene-superconductor junctions. The\nmeasured energy spectra, which depend on the phase difference between the\nsuperconductors, reveal the presence of a continuum of Andreev bound states.\nMoreover, our device heterostructure geometry and materials enable us to\nmeasure the Andreev spectrum as a function of the graphene Fermi energy,\nshowing a transition between different mesoscopic regimes. Furthermore, by\nexperimentally introducing a novel concept, the supercurrent spectral density,\nwe determine the supercurrent-phase relation in a tunnelling experiment, thus\nestablishing the connection between Andreev physics at finite energy and the\nJosephson effect. This work opens up new avenues for probing exotic topological\nphases of matter in hybrid superconducting Dirac materials.\n", "  We compute the modular Hamiltonians of regions having the future horizon\nlying on a null plane. For a CFT this is equivalent to regions with boundary of\narbitrary shape lying on the null cone. These Hamiltonians have a local\nexpression on the horizon formed by integrals of the stress tensor. We prove\nthis result in two different ways, and show that the modular Hamiltonians of\nthese regions form an infinite dimensional Lie algebra. The corresponding group\nof unitary transformations moves the fields on the null surface locally along\nthe null generators with arbitrary null line dependent velocities, but act non\nlocally outside the null plane. We regain this result in greater generality\nusing more abstract tools on algebraic quantum field theory. Finally, we show\nthat modular Hamiltonians on the null surface satisfy a Markov property that\nleads to the saturation of the strong sub-additive inequality for the entropies\nand to the strong super-additivity of the relative entropy.\n", "  We discuss the problem of partitioning a macroscopic system into a collection\nof independent subsystems. The partitioning of a system into replica-like\nsubsystems is nowadays a subject of major interest in several field of\ntheoretical and applied physics, and the thermodynamic approach currently\nfavoured by practitioners is based on a phenomenological definition of an\ninterface energy associated with the partition, due to a lack of easily\ncomputable expressions for a microscopic (i.e.~particle-based) interface\nenergy. In this article, we outline a general approach to derive sharp and\ncomputable bounds for the interface free energy in terms of microscopic\nstatistical quantities. We discuss potential applications in nanothermodynamics\nand outline possible future directions.\n", "  We discuss the quark masses and the elastic $q\\bar q$ cross sections at\nfinite chemical potential in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We comment the\ngeneric features of the cross sections as functions of the chemical potential,\ntemperature and collision energy. Finally, we discuss their relevance in the\nconstruction of a relativistic transport model for heavy-ion collisions based\non this effective Lagrangian.\n", "  We present a detailed study of nuclear corrections in the deuteron (D) by\nperforming an analysis of data from deep inelastic scattering off proton and D,\ndilepton pair production in $pp$ and pD interactions, and W^+- and Z boson\nproduction in pp and p pbar collisions. In particular, we discuss the\ndetermination of the off-shell function describing the modification of the\nparton distribution functions in bound nucleons in the context of global QCD\nfits. Our results are consistent with the ones obtained independently from the\nstudy of deep inelastic scattering data off heavy nuclei with $A\\geq4$, further\nconfirming the universality of the off-shell function. We also study the\nsensitivity to the modeling of the deuteron wave function. As an important\napplication we discuss the impact of nuclear corrections to the deuteron on the\ndetermination of the d quark distribution.\n", "  We have created a stretching air flow by generating a Bessel beam of\nultrasound with an active phased array of acoustic transducers in free space.\nThe generated Bessel beam is electronically steerable in terms of its position\nand direction of propagation. The fastest spot in the flow could be located\napart from the sound source itself. The flow is formed immediately after the\nsound field is generated, which can be electronically accomplished with the\nphased array that we fabricated. We formulate the basic technique for realizing\nsuch air-borne flows and experimentally describe their physical properties. Our\ntechnique would be capable of controlling the air flow in free-space with an\nimproved temporal and spatial resolution compared with those conventionally\nconsidered.\n", "  The usage of Effective Field Theories (EFT) for LHC new physics searches is\nreceiving increasing attention. It is thus important to clarify all the aspects\nrelated with the applicability of the EFT formalism in the LHC environment,\nwhere the large available energy can produce reactions that overcome the\nmaximal range of validity, i.e. the cutoff, of the theory. We show that this\ndoes forbid to set rigorous limits on the EFT parameter space through a\nmodified version of the ordinary binned likelihood hypothesis test, which we\ndesign and validate. Our limit-setting strategy can be carried on in its\nfull-fledged form by the LHC experimental collaborations, or performed\nexternally to the collaborations, through the Simplified Likelihood approach,\nby relying on certain approximations. We apply it to the recent CMS mono-jet\nanalysis and derive limits on a Dark Matter (DM) EFT model. DM is selected as a\ncase study because the limited reach on the DM production EFT Wilson\ncoefficient and the structure of the theory suggests that the cutoff might be\ndangerously low, well within the LHC reach. However our strategy can also be\napplied to EFT's parametrising the indirect effects of heavy new physics in the\nElectroweak and Higgs sectors.\n", "  We discuss D-brane monodromies from the point of view of the gauged linear\nsigma model. We give a prescription on how to extract monodromy matrices\ndirectly from the hemisphere partition function. We illustrate this procedure\nby recomputing the monodromy matrices associated to one-parameter Calabi-Yau\nhypersurfaces in weighted projected space.\n", "  We propose a diagnostic tool for detecting non-trivial symmetry protected\ntopological (SPT) phases protected by a symmetry group $G$ in 2+1 dimensions.\nOur method is based on directly studying the 1+1-dimensional anomalous edge\nconformal field theory (CFT) of SPT phases. We claim that if the CFT is the\nedge theory of an SPT phase, then there must be an obstruction to cutting it\nopen. This obstruction manifests in the in-existence of boundary states that\npreserves both the conformal symmetry and the global symmetry $G$. We discuss\nthe relation between edgeability, the ability to find a consistent boundary\nstate, and gappability, the ability to gap out a CFT, in the presence of $G$.\nWe study several cases including time-reversal symmetric topological\ninsulators, $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric bosonic SPTs, and $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times\n\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric topological superconductors.\n", "  The paper is devoted to the problem of multivariate polynomial interpolation\nand its application to quantum secret sharing. We show that using quantum\nFourier transform one can produce the protocol for quantum secret sharing\ndistribution.\n", "  We construct two new SL(2,Z) invariant vacua of type IIB string theory which\nare bound states of $(p,q)$ strings with $(m,n)$ 5-branes, written as ((F, D1),\n(NS5, D5)) and preserve 1/4 of the full space-time supersymmetries. For the\nfirst case, the strings live inside the 5-brane world-volume and in the second\ncase the strings are perpendicular to the 5-brane world-volume. In the first\ncase, naively one would expect an attractive interaction between the strings\nand the 5-branes due to attractive force between F and D5 and also between D1\nand NS5. We find that 1/4 BPS bound state exists only when the vacuum moduli\nsatisfy certain condition which is found to be consistent with the no-force\ncondition between the branes. No such complication arises for the second case.\nThe tension formulae and the various other descendant states which can be\nobtained by the application of T-duality for both these bound states are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We have synthesized 10 new iron oxyarsenides, K$Ln_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$O$_2$ ($Ln$\n= Gd, Tb, Dy, and Ho) and Cs$Ln_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$O$_2$ ($Ln$ = Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy,\nand Ho), with the aid of lattice-match [between $A$Fe$_2$As$_2$ ($A$ = K and\nCs) and $Ln$FeAsO] approach. The resultant compounds possess hole-doped\nconducting double FeAs layers, [$A$Fe$_4$As$_4$]$^{2-}$, that are separated by\nthe insulating [$Ln_2$O$_2$]$^{2+}$ slabs. Measurements of electrical\nresistivity and dc magnetic susceptibility demonstrate bulk superconductivity\nat $T_\\mathrm{c}$ = 33 - 37 K. We find that $T_\\mathrm{c}$ correlates with the\naxis ratio $c/a$ for all 12442-type superconductors discovered. Also,\n$T_\\mathrm{c}$ tends to increase with the lattice mismatch, implying a role of\nlattice instability for the enhancement of superconductivity.\n", "  In this article we present an overview of the ESA Gaia mission and of the\nunprecedented impact that Gaia will have on the field of variable star\nresearch. We summarise the contents and impact of the first Gaia data release\non the description of variability phenomena, with particular emphasis on\npulsating star research. The Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution, although limited\nto 2.1 million stars, has been used in many studies related to pulsating stars.\nFurthermore a set of 3,194 Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars with their times series\nhave been released. Finally we present the plans for the ongoing study of\nvariable phenomena with Gaia and highlight some of the possible impacts of the\nsecond data release on variable, and specifically, pulsating stars.\n", "  Dalitz-plot analyses of $B\\rightarrow K\\pi\\pi$ decays provide direct access\nto decay amplitudes, and thereby weak and strong phases can be disentangled by\nresolving the interference patterns in phase space between intermediate\nresonant states. A phenomenological isospin analysis of $B\\rightarrow\nK^*(\\rightarrow K\\pi)\\pi$ decay amplitudes is presented exploiting available\namplitude analyses performed at the Babar, Belle and LHCb experiments. A first\napplication consists in constraining the CKM parameters thanks to an external\nhadronic input. A method, proposed some time ago by two different groups and\nrelying on a bound on the electroweak penguin contribution, is shown to lack\nthe desired robustness and accuracy, and we propose a more alluring alternative\nusing a bound on the annihilation contribution. A second application consists\nin extracting information on hadronic amplitudes assuming the values of the CKM\nparameters from a global fit to quark flavour data. The current data yields\nseveral solutions, which do not fully support the hierarchy of hadronic\namplitudes usually expected from theoretical arguments (colour suppression,\nsuppression of electroweak penguins), as illustrated from computations within\nQCD factorisation. Some prospects concerning the impact of future measurements\nat LHCb and Belle II are also presented. Results are obtained with the\nCKMfitter analysis package, featuring the frequentist statistical approach and\nusing the Rfit scheme to handle theoretical uncertainties.\n", "  We investigate superconformal surface defects in four-dimensional N=2\nsuperconformal theories. Each such defect gives rise to a module of the\nassociated chiral algebra and the surface defect Schur index is the character\nof this module. Various natural chiral algebra operations such as\nDrinfeld-Sokolov reduction and spectral flow can be interpreted as\nconstructions involving four-dimensional surface defects. We compute the index\nof these defects in the free hypermultiplet theory and Argyres-Douglas\ntheories, using both infrared techniques involving BPS states, as well as\nrenormalization group flows onto Higgs branches. In each case we find perfect\nagreement with the predicted characters.\n", "  Recent observations indicate that >99% of the small bodies in the Solar\nSystem reside in its outer reaches --- in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud.\nKuiper Belt bodies are probably the best preserved representatives of the icy\nplanetesimals that dominated the bulk of the solid mass in the early Solar\nSystem. They likely contain preserved materials inherited from the protosolar\ncloud, held in cryogenic storage since the formation of the Solar System.\nDespite their importance, they are relatively underrepresented in our\nextraterrestrial sample collections by many orders of magnitude\n($\\sim$10$^{13}$ by mass) as compared with the asteroids, represented by\nmeteorites, which are composed of materials that have generally been strongly\naltered by thermal and aqueous processes. We have only begun to scratch the\nsurface in understanding Kuiper Belt objects, but it is already clear that the\nvery limited samples of them that we have in our laboratories hold the promise\nof dramatically expanding our understanding of the formation of the Solar\nSystem. Stardust returned the first samples from a known small solar-system\nbody, the Jupiter-family comet 81P/Wild 2, and, in a separate collector, the\nfirst solid samples from the local interstellar medium. The first decade of\nStardust research resulted in more than 142 peer-reviewed publications,\nincluding 15 papers in Science. Analyses of these amazing samples continue to\nyield unexpected discoveries and to raise new questions about the history of\nthe early Solar System. We identify 9 high-priority scientific objectives for\nfuture Stardust analyses that address important unsolved problems in planetary\nscience.\n", "  Negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR) is shown to occur in\ntopological materials in the extreme quantum limit, when a magnetic field is\napplied parallel to the excitation current. We perform pulsed and DC field\nmeasurements on Pb1-xSnxSe epilayers where the topological state can be\nchemically tuned. The NLMR is observed in the topological state, but is\nsuppressed and becomes positive when the system becomes trivial. In a\ntopological material, the lowest N=0 conduction Landau level disperses down in\nenergy as a function of increasing magnetic field, while the N=0 valence Landau\nlevel disperses upwards. This anomalous behavior is shown to be responsible for\nthe observed NLMR. Our work provides an explanation of the outstanding question\nof NLMR in topological insulators and establishes this effect as a possible\nhallmark of bulk conduction in topological matter.\n", "  We present a comparative analysis of theoretical and observed light curves of\nCepheid variables using Fourier decomposition. The theoretical light curves at\nmultiple wavelengths are generated using stellar pulsation models for chemical\ncompositions representative of Cepheids in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds.\nThe observed light curves at optical ({\\it VI}), near-infrared ({\\it JHK}$_s$)\nand mid-infrared (3.6 $\\&$ 4.5-$\\mu$m) bands are compiled from the literature.\nWe discuss the variation of light curve parameters as a function of period,\nwavelength and metallicity. Theoretical and observed Fourier amplitude\nparameters decrease with increase in wavelength while the phase parameters\nincrease with wavelength. We find that theoretical amplitude parameters\nobtained using canonical mass-luminosity levels exhibit a greater offset with\nrespect to observations when compared to non-canonical relations. We also\ndiscuss the impact of variation in convective efficiency on the light curve\nstructure of Cepheid variables. The increase in mixing length parameter results\nin a zero-point offset in bolometric mean magnitudes and reduces the systematic\nlarge difference in theoretical amplitudes with respect to observations.\n", "  We report on possibility of charge current generation in nanowire made of two\ntunnel coupled one-dimensional electron waveguides by means of single magnetic\npulse lasting up to 20 ps. Existence of interlayer tunnel coupling plays a\ncrucial role in the effect described here as it allows for hybridization of the\nwave functions localized in different layers which can be dynamically modified\nby applying a time changeable in-plane magnetic field. Results of\ntime-dependent DFT calculations performed for a bilayer nanowire confining many\nelectrons show that the effect of such magnetic hybridization relies on tilting\nof electrons' energy subbands, to the left or to the right, depending on a sign\nof time derivative of oscillating magnetic field due to the Faraday law.\nConsequently, the tilted subbands become a source of charge flow along the\nwire. Strength of such magneto-induced current oscillations may achieve even\n$0.6\\mu\\textrm{A}$ but it depends on duration of magnetic pulse as well as on\ncharge density confined in nanowire which has to be unequally distributed\nbetween both transport layers to observe this effect.\n", "  We present a one-parameter family of mathematical models describing the\ndynamics of polarons in linear periodic structures such as polypeptides. By\ntuning the parameter, we are able to recover the Davydov and the Scott models.\nWe describe the physical significance of this parameter. In the continuum\nlimit, we derive analytical solutions which represent stationary polarons. On a\ndiscrete lattice, we compute stationary polaron solutions numerically. We\ninvestigate polaron propagation induced by several external forcing mechanisms.\nWe show that an electric field consisting of a constant and a periodic\ncomponent can induce polaron motion with minimal energy loss. We also show that\nthermal fluctuations can facilitate the onset of polaron motion. Finally, we\ndiscuss the bio-physical implications of our results.\n", "  We develop generalized coherent states for a class of nonlinear oscillators\nwith position-dependent effective mass in the context of the Gazeau-Klauder\nformalism and discuss some of their properties. In order to investigate the\ntemporal evolution we first explore the statistical properties by means of\nweighting distribution and the Mandel parameter. It is found that the temporal\nevolution of the coherent states may exhibit the phenomena of quantum revivals\nand fractional revivals for a particular choice of position-dependent mass\noscillator.\n", "  We investigate tracer transport on random discrete fracture networks that are\ncharacterized by the statistics of the fracture geometry and hydraulic\nconductivity. While it is well known that tracer transport through fractured\nmedia can be anomalous and particle injection modes can have major impact on\ndispersion, the incorporation of injection modes into effective transport\nmodelling has remained an open issue. The fundamental reason behind this\nchallenge is that---even if the Eulerian fluid velocity is steady---the\nLagrangian velocity distribution experienced by tracer particles evolves with\ntime from its initial distribution, which is dictated by the injection mode, to\na stationary velocity distribution. We quantify this evolution by a Markov\nmodel for particle velocities that are equidistantly sampled along\ntrajectories. This stochastic approach allows for the systematic incorporation\nof the initial velocity distribution and quantifies the interplay between\nvelocity distribution and spatial and temporal correlation. The proposed\nspatial Markov model is characterized by the initial velocity distribution,\nwhich is determined by the particle injection mode, the stationary Lagrangian\nvelocity distribution, which is derived from the Eulerian velocity\ndistribution, and the spatial velocity correlation length, which is related to\nthe characteristic fracture length. This effective model leads to a time-domain\nrandom walk for the evolution of particle positions and velocities, whose joint\ndistribution follows a Boltzmann equation. Finally, we demonstrate that the\nproposed model can successfully predict anomalous transport through discrete\nfracture networks with different levels of heterogeneity and arbitrary tracer\ninjection modes.\n", "  We study in detail generalized 4-dimensional fuzzy spheres with twisted extra\ndimensions. These spheres can be viewed as $SO(5)$-equivariant projections of\nquantized coadjoint orbits of $SO(6)$. We show that they arise as solutions in\nYang-Mills matrix models, which naturally leads to higher-spin gauge theories\non $S^4$. Several types of embeddings in matrix models are found, including one\nwith self-intersecting fuzzy extra dimensions $S^4 \\times \\mathcal{K}$, which\nis expected to entail 2+1 generations.\n", "  We report a magneto-transport study of a two-dimensional hole gas confined to\na strained Ge quantum well grown on a relaxed Si0.2Ge0.8 virtual substrate. The\nconductivity of the hole gas measured as a function of a perpendicular magnetic\nfield exhibits a zero-field peak resulting from weak anti-localization. The\npeak develops and becomes stronger upon increasing the hole density by means of\na top gate electrode. This behavior is consistent with a Rashba-type spin-orbit\ncoupling whose strength is proportional to the perpendicular electric field,\nand hence to the carrier density. By fitting the weak anti-localization peak to\na model including a dominant cubic spin-orbit coupling, we extract the\ncharacteristic transport time scales and a spin splitting energy of ~1 meV.\nFinally, we observe a weak anti-localization peak also for magnetic fields\nparallel to the quantum well and attribute this finding to a combined effect of\nsurface roughness, Zeeman splitting, and virtual occupation of higher-energy\nhole subbands.\n", "  Using a left multiplication defined on a right quaternionic Hilbert space,\nlinear self-adjoint momentum operators on a right quaternionic Hilbert space\nare defined in complete analogy with their complex counterpart. With the aid of\nthe so-obtained position and momentum operators, we study the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle on the whole set of quaternions and on a quaternionic\nslice, namely on a copy of the complex plane inside the quaternions. For the\nquaternionic harmonic oscillator, the uncertainty relation is shown to saturate\non a neighborhood of the origin in the case we consider the whole set of\nquaternions, while it is saturated on the whole slice in the case we take the\nslice-wise approach. In analogy with the complex Weyl-Heisenberg Lie algebra,\nLie algebraic structures are developed for the quaternionic case. Finally, we\nintroduce a quaternionic displacement operator which is square integrable,\nirreducible and unitary, and we study its properties.\n", "  We investigate the vector and axial-vector form factors for the pion\nradiative weak decays $\\pi^+\\to e^+\\nu_e \\gamma$ and $\\pi^+\\to e^+\\nu_e e^+\ne^-$, based on the gauged effective chiral action from the instanton vacuum in\nthe large $N_c$ limit. The nonlocal contributions, which arise from the gauging\nof the action, enhance the vector form factor by about $20\\,\\%$, whereas the\naxial-vector form factor is reduced by almost $30\\,\\%$. Both the results for\nthe vector and axial-vector form factors at the zero momentum transfer are in\ngood agreement with the experimental data. The dependence of the form factors\non the momentum transfer is also studied. The slope parameters are computed and\ncompared with other works.\n", "  We propose an oversimplified scheme to unambiguously discriminate\nnonorthogonal quantum field states inside high-Q cavities. Our scheme, which is\nbased on positive operator-valued mea- sures (POVM) technique, uses a single\nthree-level atom interacting resonantly with a single mode of a cavity-field\nand selective atomic state detectors. While the single three-level atom takes\nthe role of the ancilla, the single cavity mode field represents the system we\nwant to obtain information. The efficiency of our proposal is analyzed\nconsidering the nowadays achievements in the context of cavity QED.\n", "  This paper further discusses the tempered fractional Brownian motion, its\nergodicity, and the derivation of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation.\nThen we introduce the generalized Langevin equation with the tempered\nfractional Gaussian noise for a free particle, called tempered fractional\nLangevin equation (tfLe). While the tempered fractional Brownian motion\ndisplays localization diffusion for the long time limit and for the short time\nits mean squared displacement has the asymptotic form $t^{2H}$, we show that\nthe asymptotic form of the mean squared displacement of the tfLe transits from\n$t^2$ (ballistic diffusion for short time) to $t^{2-2H}$, and then to $t^2$\n(again ballistic diffusion for long time). On the other hand, the overdamped\ntfLe has the transition of the diffusion type from $t^{2-2H}$ to $t^2$\n(ballistic diffusion). The tfLe with harmonic potential is also considered.\n", "  The values of many phenomena in the Nature $z$ are determined in some\ndiscrete set of times t_n, separated by a small interval $\\Delta t$ (which may\nalso represent a coordinate, etc.). Let the $z$ value in neighbour point\n$t_{n+1}=t_n+\\Delta t$ be expressed by the evolution equation as $z(t_{n+1})=\nz(t_n+\\Delta t)=f(z(t_n))$. This equation gives {\\it\\underline{a discrete\ndescription}} of phenomenon. Considering phenomena at $t\\gg \\Delta t$ this\nequation is transformed often into the differential equation allowing to\ndetermine $z(t)$ -- {\\underline{\\it continuous description}}. It is usually\nassumed that the continuous description describes correctly the main features\nof a phenomenon at values $t>> \\Delta t$.\n  In this paper I show that the real behavior of some physical systems can\ndiffer strongly from that given by the continuous description. The observation\nof such effects may lead to the desire to supplement the original evolutionary\nmodel by additional mechanisms, the origin of which require special\nexplanation. We will show that such construction may not be necessary -- simple\nevolution model can describe different observable effects.\n  This text contains no new calculations. Most of the discussed facts are well\nknown. New is the treatment of the results.\n", "  We investigate the effect of Al doping on the magnetic properties of the\nalloy CoFeB. Comparative measurements of the saturation magnetization, the\nGilbert damping parameter $\\alpha$ and the exchange constant as a function of\nthe annealing temperature for CoFeB and CoFeAlB thin films are presented. Our\nresults reveal a strong reduction of the magnetization for CoFeAlB in\ncomparison to CoFeB. If the prepared CoFeAlB films are amorphous, the damping\nparameter $\\alpha$ is unaffected by the Al doping in comparison to the CoFeB\nalloy. In contrast, in the case of a crystalline CoFeAlB film, $\\alpha$ is\nfound to be reduced. Furthermore, the x-ray characterization and the evolution\nof the exchange constant with the annealing temperature indicate a similar\ncrystallization process in both alloys. The data proves the suitability of\nCoFeAlB for spin torque switching properties where a reduction of the switching\ncurrent in comparison with CoFeB is expected.\n", "  Both k-essence and the pressureless perfect fluid develop caustic\nsingularities at finite time. We further explore the connection between the two\nand show that they belong to the same class of models, which admits the caustic\nfree completion by means of the canonical complex scalar field. Specifically,\nthe free massive/self-interacting complex scalar reproduces dynamics of\npressureless perfect fluid/shift-symmetric k-essence under certain initial\nconditions in the limit of large mass/sharp self-interacting potential. We\nelucidate a mechanism of resolving caustic singularities in the complete\npicture. The collapse time is promoted to complex number. Hence, the\nsingularity is not developed in real time. The same conclusion holds for a\ncollection of collisionless particles modelled by means of the Schroedinger\nequation, or ultra-light axions (generically, coherent oscillations of bosons\nin the Bose--Einstein condensate state).\n", "  The mechanisms underlying cardiac fibrillation have been investigated for\nover a century, but we are still finding surprising results that change our\nview of this phenomenon. The present study focuses on the transition from\nnormal rhythm to atrial fibrillation associated with a gradual increase in the\npacing rate. While some of our findings are consistent with existing\nexperimental, numerical, and theoretical studies of this problem, one result\nappears to contradict the accepted picture. Specifically we show that, in a\ntwo-dimensional model of paced homogeneous atrial tissue, transition from\ndiscordant alternans to conduction block, wave breakup, reentry, and spiral\nwave chaos is associated with transient growth of finite amplitude disturbances\nrather than a conventional instability. It is mathematically very similar to\nsubcritical, or bypass, transition from laminar fluid flow to turbulence, which\nallows many of the tools developed in the context of fluid turbulence to be\nused for improving our understanding of cardiac arrhythmias.\n", "  We compute the Bayesian Evidence for models considered in the main analysis\nof Planck cosmic microwave background data. By utilising carefully-defined\nnearest-neighbour distances in parameter space, we reuse the Monte Carlo Markov\nChains already produced for parameter inference to compute Bayes factors $B$\nfor many different model-dataset combinations. Standard 6-parameter flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM model is favoured over all other models considered, with curvature\nbeing mildly favoured only when CMB lensing is not included. Many alternative\nmodels are strongly disfavoured by the data, including primordial correlated\nisocurvature models ($\\ln B=-7.8$), non-zero scalar-to-tensor ratio ($\\ln\nB=-4.3$), running of the spectral index ($\\ln B = -4.7$), curvature ($\\ln\nB=-3.6$), non-standard numbers of neutrinos ($\\ln B=-3.1$), non-standard\nneutrino masses ($\\ln B=-3.2$), non-standard lensing potential ($\\ln B=-4.6$),\nevolving dark energy ($\\ln B=-3.2$), sterile neutrinos ($\\ln B=-6.9$), and\nextra sterile neutrinos with a non-zero scalar-to-tensor ratio ($\\ln B=-10.8$).\nOther models are less strongly disfavoured with respect to flat $\\Lambda$CDM.\nAs with all analyses based on Bayesian Evidence, the final numbers depend on\nthe widths of the parameter priors. We adopt the priors used in the Planck\nanalysis, while performing a prior sensitivity analysis. Our quantitative\nconclusion is that extensions beyond the standard cosmological model are\ndisfavoured by Planck data. Only when newer Hubble constant measurements are\nincluded does $\\Lambda$CDM become disfavoured, and only mildly, compared with a\ndynamical dark energy model ($\\ln B\\sim +2$).\n", "  The definition and manipulation of Langevin equations with multiplicative\nwhite noise require special care (one has to specify the time discretisation\nand a stochastic chain rule has to be used to perform changes of variables).\nWhile discretisation-scheme transformations and non-linear changes of variable\ncan be safely performed on the Langevin equation, these same transformations\nlead to inconsistencies in its path-integral representation. We identify their\norigin and we show how to extend the well-known It\\=o prescription ($dB^2=dt$)\nin a way that defines a modified stochastic calculus to be used inside the\npath-integral representation of the process, in its Onsager-Machlup form.\n", "  We provide a quantum information description of a proposed five-blade neutron\ninterferometer geometry and show that it is robust against low frequency\nmechanical vibrations and dephasing due to the dynamical phase. The extent to\nwhich the dynamical phase affects the contrast in a neutron interferometer is\nexperimentally shown. In our model, we consider the coherent evolution of a\nneutron wavepacket in an interferometer crystal blade and simulate the effect\nof mechanical vibrations and momentum spread of the neutron through the\ninterferometer. The standard three-blade neutron interferometer is shown to be\nimmune to dynamical phase noise but prone to noise from mechanical vibrations,\nthe decoherence free subspace four-blade neutron interferometer is shown to be\nimmune to mechanical vibration noise but prone to noise from the dynamical\nphase, while the proposed five-blade neutron interferometer is shown to be\nimmune to both low-frequency mechanical vibration noise and dynamical phase\nnoise.\n", "  We report the formation of perfectly aligned, high-density, shallow nitrogen\nvacancy (NV) centers on the ($111$) surface of a diamond. The study involved\nstep-flow growth with a high flux of nitrogen during chemical vapor deposition\n(CVD) growth, which resulted in the formation of a highly concentrated\n(>$10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$) nitrogen layer approximately $10$ nm away from the\nsubstrate surface. Photon counts obtained from the NV centers indicated the\npresence of $6.1$x$10^{15}$-$3.1$x$10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ NV centers, which\nsuggested the formation of an ensemble of NV centers. The optically detected\nmagnetic resonance (ODMR) spectrum confirmed perfect alignment (more than $99$\n%) for all the samples fabricated by step-flow growth via CVD. Perfectly\naligned shallow ensemble NV centers indicated a high Rabi contrast of\napproximately $30$ % which is comparable to the values reported for a single NV\ncenter. Nanoscale NMR demonstrated surface-sensitive nuclear spin detection and\nprovided a confirmation of the NV centers depth. Single NV center approximation\nindicated that the depth of the NV centers was approximately $9$-$10.7$ nm from\nthe surface with error of less than $\\pm$$0.8$ nm. Thus, a route for material\ncontrol of shallow NV centers has been developed by step-flow growth using a\nCVD system. Our finding pioneers on the atomic level control of NV center\nalignment for large area quantum magnetometry.\n", "  We obtain a general solution for the probability density function of wave\nintensities in non-stationary Wave Turbulence. The solution is expressed in\nterms of the wave action spectrum evolving according the the wave-kinetic\nequation. We establish that, in absence of wave breaking, the wave statistics\nasymptotes to a Gaussian distribution in forced-dissipated wave systems that\napproach a steady state. Also, in non-stationary systems, if the statistics is\nGaussian initially, it will remain Gaussian at any time. Generally, the\nstatistics that is not Gaussian initially will remain non-Gaussian over the\ncharacteristic nonlinear time of the wave spectrum. In freely decaying wave\nturbulence, substantial deviations from Gaussianity may persist infinitely\nlong.\n", "  We explore the anomaly-cancellation constraints on simplified dark matter\n(DM) models with an extra U(1)$^\\prime$ gauge boson $Z'$. We show that, if the\nStandard Model (SM) fermions are supplemented by a single DM fermion $\\chi$\nthat is a singlet of the SM gauge group, and the SM quarks have non-zero\nU(1)$^\\prime$ charges, the SM leptons must also have non-zero U(1)$^\\prime$\ncharges, in which case LHC searches impose strong constraints on the $Z'$ mass.\nMoreover, the DM fermion $\\chi$ must have a vector-like U(1)$^\\prime$ coupling.\nIf one requires the DM particle to have a purely axial U(1)$^\\prime$ coupling,\nwhich would be the case if $\\chi$ were a Majorana fermion and would reduce the\nimpact of direct DM searches, the simplest possibility is that it is\naccompanied by one other new singlet fermion, but in this case the\nU(1)$^\\prime$ charges of the SM leptons still do not vanish. This is also true\nin a range of models with multiple new singlet fermions with identical charges.\nSearching for a leptophobic model, we then introduce extra fermions that\ntransform non-trivially under the SM gauge group. We find several such models\nif the DM fermion is accompanied by two or more other new fermions with\nnon-identical charges, which may have interesting experimental signatures. We\npresent benchmark representatives of the various model classes we discuss.\n", "  We compute the full probability distribution of the positions of a tagged\nparticle exactly for given arbitrary initial positions of the particles and for\ngeneral single-particle propagators. We consider the thermodynamic limit of our\nexact expressions in quenched and annealed settings. For a particular class of\nsingle-particle propagators, the exact formula is expressed in a simple\nintegral form in the quenched case whereas in the annealed case, it is\nexpressed as a simple combination of Bessel functions. In particular, we focus\non the step and the power-law initial configurations. In the former case, a\ndrift is induced even when the one-particle propagators are symmetric. On the\nother hand, in the later case the scaling of the cumulants of the position of\nthe tracer becomes different than the uniform case. We provide numerical\nverifications of our results.\n", "  We investigate a thermoelectric nano-engine whose properties are steered by\nCoulomb interaction. The device whose design decouples charge and energy\ncurrents is made up of two interacting quantum dots connected to three\ndifferent reservoirs. We show that, by tailoring the tunnel couplings, this\nsetup can be made very attractive for energy-harvesting prospects, due to a\ndelivered power that can be of the order of the quantum bound [R. S. Whitney,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 112, 130601 (2014); Entropy 18, 208 (2016)], with a\nconcomitant fair efficiency. To unveil its properties beyond the sequential\nquantum master equation, we apply a nonequilibrium noncrossing approximation in\nthe Keldysh Green's function formalism, and a quantum master equation that\nincludes cotunneling processes. Both approaches are rather qualitatively\nsimilar in a large operating regime where sequential tunneling alone fails.\n", "  We study two-loop quantum corrections to the low-energy effective actions in\nN=(2,2) and N=(4,4) SQED in the Coulomb branch. In the latter model, the\nlow-energy effective action is described by a generalized Kahler potential\nwhich depends on both chiral and twisted chiral superfields. We demonstrate\nthat this generalized Kahler potential is one-loop exact and corresponds to the\nN=(4,4) sigma-model with torsion presented by Rocek, Schoutens and Sevrin. In\nthe N=(2,2) SQED, the effective Kahler potential is not protected against\nhigher-loop quantum corrections. The two-loop quantum corrections to this\npotential and the corresponding sigma-model metric are explicitly found.\n", "  Memory effects of gravitational waves from astronomical events or primordial\nuniverse might have the information of new physics. It is intriguing to observe\nthat the memory effect exists in electrodynamics as a net momentum kick, while\nthe memory effect in gravity appears as a net relatively displacement. In\nparticular, Winicour has shown that the B-mode memory, which characterizes\nparity odd global distribution of memory, does not exist. We study the memory\neffect in axion electrodynamics and find that the B-mode memory effect can\nexist provided the existence of coherently oscillating axion background field.\nMoreover, we examine the detectability of the axion dark matter using this\neffect. We also argue the existence of the B-mode gravitational memory effect\nin the presence of the axion dark matter.\n", "  We develop a systematic procedure for computing maximal unitarity cuts of\nmultiloop Feynman integrals in arbitrary dimension. Our approach is based on\nthe Baikov representation in which the structure of the cuts is particularly\nsimple. We examine several planar and nonplanar integral topologies and\ndemonstrate that the maximal cut inherits IBPs and dimension shift identities\nsatisfied by the uncut integral. Furthermore, for the examples we calculated,\nwe find that the maximal cut functions from different allowed regions, form the\nWronskian matrix of the differential equations on the maximal cut.\n", "  Multiphase Co-35Ni-20Mo-10Cr alloy MP35N is a high strength alloy with\nexcellent corrosion resistance. Its applications span chemical, medical, and\nfood processing industries. Thanks to its high modulus and high strength, it\nfound applications in reinforcement of ultra-high field pulsed magnets.\nRecently, it has also been considered for reinforcement in superconducting\nwires used in ultra-high field superconducting magnets. For these applications,\naccurate measurement of its physical properties at cryogenic temperatures is\nvery important. In this paper, physical properties including electrical\nresistivity, specific heat, thermal conductivity, and magnetization of\nas-received and aged samples are measured from 2 to 300 K. The electrical\nresistivity of the aged sample is slightly higher than the as-received sample,\nboth showing a weak linear temperature dependence in the entire range of 2 -\n300 K. The measured specific heat Cp of 0.43 J/g-K at 295 K agrees with a\ntheoretical prediction, but is significantly smaller than the values in the\nliterature. The thermal conductivity between 2 and 300 K is in good agreement\nwith the literature which is only available above 77 K. Magnetic property of\nMP35N changes significantly with aging. The as-received sample exhibits Curie\nparamagnetism with a Curie constant C = 0.175 K. While the aged sample contains\nsmall amounts of a ferromagnetic phase even at room temperature. The measured\nMP35N properties will be useful for the engineering design of pulsed magnets\nand superconducting magnets using MP35N as reinforcement.\n", "  In the so-called (2,2) theory, which is the U(N)^4 circular quiver\nsuperconformal Chern-Simons theory with levels (k,0,-k,0), it was known that\nthe instanton effects are described by the free energy of topological strings\nwhose Gopakumar-Vafa invariants coincide with those of the local D_5 del Pezzo\ngeometry. By considering two types of one-parameter rank deformations U(N) x\nU(N+M) x U(N+2M) x U(N+M) and U(N+M) x U(N) x U(N+M) x U(N), we classify the\nknown diagonal BPS indices by degrees. Together with other two types of\none-parameter deformations, we further propose the topological string\nexpression when both of the above two deformations are turned on.\n", "  We study 1+1 dimensional $\\phi^4$ theory using the recently proposed method\nof conformal truncation. Starting in the UV CFT of free field theory, we\nconstruct a complete basis of states with definite conformal Casimir,\n$\\mathcal{C}$. We use these states to express the Hamiltonian of the full\ninteracting theory in lightcone quantization. After truncating to states with\n$\\mathcal{C} \\leq \\mathcal{C}_{\\max}$, we numerically diagonalize the\nHamiltonian at strong coupling and study the resulting IR dynamics. We compute\nnon-perturbative spectral densities of several local operators, which are\nequivalent to real-time, infinite-volume correlation functions. These spectral\ndensities, which include the Zamolodchikov $C$-function along the full RG flow,\nare calculable at any value of the coupling. Near criticality, our numerical\nresults reproduce correlation functions in the 2D Ising model.\n", "  Presence of the light gravitino as dark matter candidate in a supersymmetric\n(SUSY) model opens up interesting collider signatures consisting of one or more\nhard photons together with multiple jets and missing transverse energy from the\ncascade decay. We investigate such signals at the 13 TeV LHC in presence of\ncompressed SUSY spectra, consistent with the Higgs mass as well as collider and\ndark matter constraints. We analyse and compare the discovery potential in\ndifferent benchmark scenarios consisting of both compressed and uncompressed\nSUSY spectra, considering different levels of compression and intermediate\ndecay modes. Our conclusion is that compressed spectra upto 2.5 TeV are likely\nto be probed even before the high luminosity run of LHC. Kinematic variables\nare also suggested, which offer distinction between compressed and uncompressed\nspectra yielding similar event rates for photons + multi-jets + $E\\!\\!\\!\\!/_T$.\n", "  The dependence of the heat transfer, as measured by the nondimensional\nNusselt number $Nu$, on Ekman pumping for rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\\'enard\nconvection in an infinite plane layer is examined for fluids with Prandtl\nnumber $Pr = 1$. A joint effort utilizing simulations from the Composite\nNon-hydrostatic Quasi-Geostrophic model (CNH-QGM) and direct numerical\nsimulations (DNS) of the incompressible fluid equations has mapped a wide range\nof the Rayleigh number $Ra$ - Ekman number $E$ parameter space within the\ngeostrophic regime of rotating convection. Corroboration of the $Nu$-$Ra$\nrelation at $E = 10^{-7}$ from both methods along with higher $E$ covered by\nDNS and lower $E$ by the asymptotic model allows for this range of the heat\ntransfer results. For stress-free boundaries, the relation $Nu-1 \\propto (Ra\nE^{4/3} )^{\\alpha} $ has the dissipation-free scaling of $\\alpha = 3/2$ for all\n$E \\leq 10^{-7}$. This is directly related to a geostrophic turbulent interior\nthat throttles the heat transport supplied to the thermal boundary layers. For\nno-slip boundaries, the existence of ageostrophic viscous boundary layers and\ntheir associated Ekman pumping yields a more complex 2D surface in $Nu(E,Ra)$\nparameter space. For $E<10^{-7}$ results suggest that the surface can be\nexpressed as $Nu-1 \\propto (1+ P(E)) (Ra E^{4/3} )^{3/2}$ indicating the\ndissipation-free scaling law is enhanced by Ekman pumping by the multiplicative\nprefactor $(1+ P(E))$ where $P(E) \\approx 5.97 E^{1/8}$. It follows for\n$E<10^{-7}$ that the geostrophic turbulent interior remains the flux bottleneck\nin rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection. For $E\\sim10^{-7}$, where DNS\nand asymptotic simulations agree quantitatively, it is found that the effects\nof Ekman pumping are sufficiently strong to influence the heat transport with\ndiminished exponent $\\alpha \\approx 1.2$ and $Nu-1 \\propto (Ra E^{4/3}\n)^{1.2}$.\n", "  Loosely speaking, the Shannon entropy rate is used to gauge a stochastic\nprocess' intrinsic randomness; the statistical complexity gives the cost of\npredicting the process. We calculate, for the first time, the entropy rate and\nstatistical complexity of stochastic processes generated by finite unifilar\nhidden semi-Markov models---memoryful, state-dependent versions of renewal\nprocesses. Calculating these quantities requires introducing novel mathematical\nobjects ({\\epsilon}-machines of hidden semi-Markov processes) and new\ninformation-theoretic methods to stochastic processes.\n", "  We introduce a Skyrme type model with the target space being the 3-sphere S^3\nand with an action possessing, as usual, quadratic and quartic terms in field\nderivatives. The novel character of the model is that the strength of the\ncouplings of those two terms are allowed to depend upon the space-time\ncoordinates. The model should therefore be interpreted as an effective theory,\nsuch that those couplings correspond in fact to low energy expectation values\nof fields belonging to a more fundamental theory at high energies. The theory\npossesses a self-dual sector that saturates the Bogomolny bound leading to an\nenergy depending linearly on the topological charge. The self-duality equations\nare conformally invariant in three space dimensions leading to a toroidal\nansatz and exact self-dual Skyrmion solutions. Those solutions are labelled by\ntwo integers and, despite their toroidal character, the energy density is\nspherically symmetric when those integers are equal and oblate or prolate\notherwise.\n", "  Most models of new physics contain extended Higgs sectors with multiple Higgs\nbosons. The observation of an additional Higgs boson, besides the $\\sim 125$\nGeV `$h_{\\rm obs}$', will thus serve as an irrefutable evidence of physics\nbeyond the Standard Model (SM). However, even when fairly light, these\nadditional Higgs bosons may have escaped detection at the Large\nElectron-Positron collider, the Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nhitherto, owing to their highly reduced couplings to the SM particles.\nTherefore, in addition to the searches based on the conventional production\nprocesses of these Higgs bosons, such as gluon or vector boson fusion, possible\nnew search modes need to be exploited at collider experiments in order to\nestablish their signatures. We investigate here the phenomenology of\npseudoscalars, with masses ranging from $\\mathcal{O}$(1) GeV to about 150 GeV,\nin the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric SM and the Type-I 2-Higgs Doublet Model\nin some such atypical search channels at the LHC Run-II.\n", "  In the present work we study the scale dependence at the level of the\neffective action of charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell as well as in\nEinstein-power-Maxwell theories in (2+1)-dimensional spacetimes without a\ncosmological constant. We allow for scale dependence of the gravitational and\nelectromagnetic couplings, and we solve the corresponding generalized field\nequations imposing the \"null energy condition\". Certain properties, such as\nhorizon structure and thermodynamics, are discussed in detail.\n", "  The field line random walk (FLRW) of magnetic turbulence is one of the\nimportant topics in plasma physics and astrophysics. In this article by using\nthe field line tracing method mean square displacements (MSD) of FLRW is\ncalculated in all possible length scales for pure two-dimensional turbulence\nwith damping dynamical model. We demonstrate that in order to describe FLRW\nwith damping dynamical model a new dimensionless quantity $R$ is needed to be\nintroduced. In different length scales dimensionless MSD shows different\nrelationship with the dimensionless quantity $R$. Although temporal effect\nimpacts MSD of FLRW and even changes regimes of FLRW, it dose not affect the\nrelationship between the dimensionless MSD and dimensionless quantity $R$ in\nall possible length scales.\n", "  We consider a quasi-static quantum Otto cycle using two effectively two-level\nsystems with degeneracy in the excited state. The systems are coupled through\nisotropic exchange interaction of strength $J>0$, in the presence of an\nexternal magnetic field $B$ which is varied during the cycle. We prove the\npositive work condition, and show that level-degeneracy can act as a\nthermodynamic resource, so that a larger amount of work can be extracted than\nfrom the non-degenerate case, both with and without coupling. We also derive an\nupper bound for the efficiency of the cycle. This bound is the same as derived\nfor a system of coupled spin-1/2 particles [G. Thomas and R. S. Johal, Phys.\nRev. E {\\bf 83}, 031135 (2011)] i.e. without degeneracy, and depends only on\nthe control parameters of the Hamiltonian, but is independent of the level\ndegeneracy and the reservoir temperatures.\n", "  We study the type II string vacua with chiral space-time SUSY constructed as\nasymmetric orbifolds of torus and $ K3 $ compactifications. Despite the fact\nthat all the D-branes are non-BPS in any chiral SUSY vacua, we show that the\nrelevant non-geometric vacua of asymmetric orbifolds allow rather generally\nconfigurations of D-branes which lead to vanishing cylinder amplitudes,\nimplying the bose-fermi cancellation at each mass level of the open string\nspectrum. After working on simple models of toroidal asymmetric orbifolds, we\nfocus on the asymmetric orbifolds of $ T^2 \\times {\\cal M} $, where $ {\\cal M}\n$ is described by a general $ {\\cal N} =4 $ SCFT with $ c=6 $ defined by the\nGepner construction for $ K3 $. Even when the modular invariant partition\nfunctions in the bulk remain unchanged, the spectra of such non-BPS D-branes\nwith the bose-fermi cancellation can vary significantly according to the choice\nof orbifolding.\n", "  Our aim is to test potential solar prominence plasma diagnostics as obtained\nwith the new solar capability of the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter\nArray (ALMA). We investigate the thermal and plasma diagnostic potential of\nALMA for solar prominences through the computation of brightness temperatures\nat ALMA wavelengths. The brightness temperature, for a chosen line of sight, is\ncalculated using densities of hydrogen and helium obtained from a radiative\ntransfer code under non local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) conditions, as\nwell as the input internal parameters of the prominence model in consideration.\nTwo distinct sets of prominence models were used: isothermal-isobaric\nfine-structure threads, and large-scale structures with radially increasing\ntemperature distributions representing the prominence-to-corona transition\nregion. We compute brightness temperatures over the range of wavelengths in\nwhich ALMA is capable of observing (0.32 - 9.6mm), however we particularly\nfocus on the bands available to solar observers in ALMA cycles 4 and 5, namely\n2.6 - 3.6mm (Band 3) and 1.1 - 1.4mm (Band 6). We show how the computed\nbrightness temperatures and optical thicknesses in our models vary with the\nplasma parameters (temperature and pressure) and the wavelength of observation.\nWe then study how ALMA observables such as the ratio of brightness temperatures\nat two frequencies can be used to estimate the optical thickness and the\nemission measure for isothermal and non-isothermal prominences. From this study\nwe conclude that, for both sets of models, ALMA presents a strong thermal\ndiagnostic capability, provided that the interpretation of observations is\nsupported by the use of non-LTE simulation results.\n", "  We consider $M$-theory compactified on $T^4 \\times T^2$ and describe the\ncount of spinning $1/8$-BPS states. This refines the classic count of\nMaldacena-Moore-Strominger in the physics literature and the recent\nmathematical work of Bryan-Oberdieck-Pandharipande-Yin, which studied reduced\nDonaldson-Thomas invariants of abelian surfaces and threefolds. As in previous\nwork on $K3 \\times T^2$ compactification, we track angular momenta under both\nthe $SU(2)_L$ and $SU(2)_R$ factors in the 5d little group, providing\npredictions for the relevant motivic curve counts.\n", "  The analogues of giant magnon configurations are studied on the string world\nsheet in the lambda background. This is a discrete deformation of the\nAdS(5)xS(5) background that preserves the integrability of the world sheet\ntheory. Giant magnon solutions are generated using the dressing method and\ntheir dispersion relation is found. This reduces to the usual dyonic giant\nmagnon dispersion relation in the appropriate limit and becomes relativistic in\nanother limit where the lambda model becomes the generalized sine-Gordon theory\nof the Pohlmeyer reduction. The scattering of giant magnons is then shown in\nthe semi-classical limit to be described by the quantum S-matrix that is a\nquantum group deformation of the conventional giant magnon S-matrix. It is\nfurther shown that in the small g limit, a sector of the S-matrix is related to\nthe XXZ spin chain whose spectrum matches the spectrum of magnon bound states.\n", "  In holographic applications one can encounter scenarios where a\nlong-wavelength instability can arise. In such situations, it is often the case\nthat the dynamical end point of the instability is a new equilibrium phase with\na nonlinear scalar hair condensate outside the black hole horizon. We here\nreview holographic setups where symmetric horizons suffer from long-wavelength\ninstabilities where a suitable equilibrium condensate phase does not exist. We\nstudy the dynamics of the simplest model in this exotic class, and show that it\nuncovers arbitrarily large curvatures in the vicinity of the horizon which\nasymptotically turn such region singular, at finite time with respect to the\nboundary theory.\n", "  We investigate correlations in the fragment momentum distribution due to the\npropagation of fragments under the influence of their mutual Coulomb field,\nafter the breakup of an excited nuclear source.The magnitude of the effects on\nthe nuclear temperatures obtained from such distributions is estimated with the\nhelp of a simple approach in which a charged fragment interacts with a\nhomogeneous charged sphere. The resuslts are used to correct the temperatures\nobtained from the asymptotic momentum distributions of fragments produced by a\nMonte-Carlo simulation in which the system's configuration at breakup is\nprovided by the canonical version of the Statistical Multifragmentation Model.\nIn a separate calculation, the dynamics of this many-particle charged system is\nfollowed in a molecular dynamics calculation until the fragments are far away\nfrom the breakup volume. The results suggest that, although the magnitude of\nthe corrections is similar in both models, many-particle correlations present\nin the second approach are non-negligible and should be taken into account in\norder to minimize ambiguities in such studies.\n", "  We analyze the collider signatures of the real singlet extension of the\nStandard Model in regions consistent with a strong first-order electroweak\nphase transition and a singlet-like scalar heavier than the Standard Model-like\nHiggs. A definitive correlation exists between the strength of the phase\ntransition and the trilinear coupling of the Higgs to two singlet-like scalars,\nand hence between the phase transition and non-resonant scalar pair production\ninvolving the singlet at colliders. We study the prospects for observing these\nprocesses at the LHC and a future 100 TeV $pp$ collider, focusing particularly\non double singlet production. We also discuss correlations between the strength\nof the electroweak phase transition and other observables at hadron and future\nlepton colliders. Searches for non-resonant singlet-like scalar pair production\nat 100 TeV would provide a sensitive probe of the electroweak phase transition\nin this model, complementing resonant di-Higgs searches and precision\nmeasurements. Our study illustrates a strategy for systematically exploring the\nphenomenologically viable parameter space of this model, which we hope will be\nuseful for future work.\n", "  We demonstrate that the five vortex equations recently introduced by Manton\nariseas symmetry reductions of the anti-self-dual Yang--Mills equations in four\ndimensions. In particular the Jackiw--Pi vortex and the Ambj\\o rn--Olesen\nvortex correspond to the gauge group $SU(1, 1)$, and respectively the Euclidean\nor the $SU(2)$ symmetry groups acting with two-dimensional orbits. We show how\nto obtain vortices with higher vortex numbers, by superposing vortex equations\nof different types. Finally we use the kinetic energy of the Yang--Mills theory\nin 4+1 dimensions to construct a metric on vortex moduli spaces. This metric is\nnot positive-definite in cases of non-compact gauge groups.\n", "  We give an account of the gravitational memory effect in the presence of the\nexact plane wave solution of Einstein's vacuum equations. This allows an\nelementary but exact description of the soft gravitons and how their presence\nmay be detected by observing the motion of freely falling particles. The\ntheorem of Bondi and Pirani on caustics (for which we present a new proof)\nimplies that the asymptotic relative velocity is constant but not zero, in\ncontradiction with the permanent displacement claimed by Zel'dovich and\nPolnarev. A non-vanishing asymptotic relative velocity might be used to detect\ngravitational waves through the \"velocity memory effect\", considered by\nBraginsky, Thorne, Grishchuk, and Polnarev.\n", "  We present a comprehensive seismic study of the three pulsating stars of\n$\\beta$ Cep/SPB type: $\\nu$ Eridani, 12 Lacertae and $\\gamma$ Pegasi. Models\nwith the modified mean opacity profile are constructed in order to account for\nboth the observed frequency range and the values of some individual\nfrequencies. To decrease the number of possible solutions, we make use of the\nnon-adiabatic parameter $f$, whose value is very sensitive to subphotospheric\nlayers where pulsations are driven. This complex seismic modelling show the\nneed for a significant modification of the opacity profile.\n", "  We used DFT to study the energetics of the decomposition of alane, AlH3, on\nthe Si(001) surface, as the acceptor complement to PH3. Alane forms a dative\nbond with the raised atoms of silicon surface dimers, via the Si atom lone\npair. We calculated the energies of various structures along the pathway of\nsuccessive dehydrogenation events following adsorption: AlH2, AlH and Al,\nfinding a gradual, significant decrease in energy. For each stage, we analyse\nthe structure and bonding, and present simulated STM images of the lowest\nenergy structures. Finally, we find that the energy of Al atoms incorporated\ninto the surface, ejecting a Si atom, is comparable to Al adatoms. These\nfindings show that Al incorporation is likely to be as precisely controlled as\nP incorporation, if slightly less easy to achieve.\n", "  Several applications, such as optical tweezers and atom guiding, benefit from\ntechniques that allow the engineering of optical fields' spatial profiles, in\nparticular their longitudinal intensity patterns. In cylindrical coordinates,\nmethods such as Frozen Waves allow an advanced control of beams'\ncharacteristics, but in Cartesian coordinates there is no analogous technique.\nSince Cartesian beams may also be useful for applications, we develop here a\nmethod to modulate on-demand the longitudinal intensity pattern of any\n(initially) unidimensional Cartesian beam with concentrated wavevector\nspectrum, thus encompassing all paraxial unidimensional beams. To this end, we\nwrite the total beam as a product of two unidimensional beams and explore the\ndegree of freedom provided by the additional Cartesian coordinate. While in the\nplane where this coordinate is zero the chosen unidimensional beam keeps its\nstructure with the additional desired intensity modulation, a sinusoidal-like\noscillation appears in the direction of this variable and creates a spot whose\nsize is tunable. Examples with Gaussian and Airy beams are presented and their\ncorresponding experimental demonstrations are performed to show the validity of\nthe method.\n", "  Quantum reactive scattering calculations are reported for the ultracold\nhydrogen-exchange reaction and its non-reactive atom-exchange isotopic\ncounterparts, proceeding from excited rotational states. It is shown that while\nthe geometric phase (GP) does not necessarily control the reaction to all final\nstates one can always find final states where it does. For the isotopic\ncounterpart reactions these states can be used to make a measurement of the GP\neffect by separately measuring the even and odd symmetry contributions, which\nexperimentally requires nuclear-spin final-state resolution. This follows from\nsymmetry considerations that make the even and odd identical-particle exchange\nsymmetry wavefunctions which include the GP locally equivalent to the opposite\nsymmetry wavefunctions which do not. This equivalence reflects the important\nrole discrete symmetries play in ultracold chemistry generally and highlights\nthe key role ultracold reactions can play in understanding fundamental aspects\nof chemical reactivity.\n", "  Recent demonstrations of optically pumped lasers based on GeSn alloys put\nforward the prospect of efficient laser sources monolithically integrated on a\nSi photonic platform. For instance, GeSn layers with 12.5% of Sn were reported\nto lase at 2.5 um wavelength up to 130 K. In this work, we report a longer\nemitted wavelength and a significant improvement in lasing temperature. The\nimprovements resulted from the use of higher Sn content GeSn layers of\noptimized crystalline quality, grown on graded Sn content buffers using Reduced\nPressure CVD. The fabricated GeSn micro-disks with 13% and 16% of Sn showed\nlasing operation at 2.6 um and 3.1 um wavelengths, respectively. For the\nlongest wavelength (i.e 3.1 um), lasing was demonstrated up to 180 K, with a\nthreshold of 377 kW/cm2 at 25 K.\n", "  Motivated by cosmological examples we study quantum field theoretical\ntunnelling from an initial state where the \"classical field\", i.e. the vacuum\nexpectation value of the field operator is spatially homogeneous but performing\na time-dependent oscillation about a local minimum. In particular we estimate\nboth analytically and numerically the exponential contribution to the\ntunnelling probability. We additionally show that after the tunnelling event,\nthe classical field solution - the so-called \"bubble\" - mediating the phase\ntransition can either grow or collapse. We present a simple analytical\ncriterium to distinguish between the two behaviours.\n", "  In the singlet-triplet majoron model of neutrino mass, lepton number is\nspontaneously broken. If it is also softly broken, then a naturally light\npseudoscalar particle $\\eta_I$ exists. It may then act as a light mediator for\na real singlet scalar $\\chi$ with odd dark parity. It is itself unstable, but\ndecays dominantly to two neutrinos through its triplet scalar component,\nthereby not disturbing the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It also mixes\nwith the standard-model Higgs boson only in one loop, thereby not contributing\nsignificantly to the elastic scattering of $\\chi$ off nuclei in dark-matter\ndirect-search experiments.\n", "  We investigate the properties of Type IIP supernovae that are dominantly\npowered by the rotational kinetic energy of the newly born neutron star. While\nthe spin-down of a magnetar has previously been proposed as a viable energy\nsource in the context of super-luminous supernovae, we show that a similar\nmechanism could produce both normal and peculiar Type IIP supernova light\ncurves from red supergiant progenitors for a range of initial spin periods and\nequivalent dipole magnetic field strengths. Although the formation channel for\nsuch magnetars in a typical red supergiant progenitor is unknown, it is\ntantalizing that this proof of concept model is capable of producing ordinary\nType IIP lightcurve properties, perhaps implying that rotation rate and\nmagnetic field strength may play important roles in some ordinary looking Type\nIIP supernova explosions.\n", "  The role of defects in solids of mixed ionic-covalent bonds such as\nferroelectric oxides is complex. Current understanding of defects on\nferroelectric properties at the single-defect level remains mostly at the\nempirical level, and the detailed atomistic mechanisms for many defect-mediated\npolarization-switching processes have not been convincingly revealed quantum\nmechanically. We simulate the polarization-electric field (P-E) and\nstrain-electric field ({$\\epsilon$}-E) hysteresis loops for BaTiO3 in the\npresence of generic defect dipoles with large-scale molecular dynamics and\nprovide a detailed atomistic picture of the defect dipole-enhanced\nelectromechanical coupling. We develop a general first-principles-based\natomistic model, enabling a quantitative understanding of the relationship\nbetween macroscopic ferroelectric properties and dipolar impurities of\ndifferent orientations, concentrations, and dipole moments. We find that the\ncollective orientation of dipolar defects relative to the external field is the\nkey microscopic structure feature that strongly affects materials\nhardening/softening and electromechanical coupling. We show that a small\nconcentration (0.1 at.%) of defect dipoles dramatically improves\nelectromechanical response. This offers the opportunity to improve the\nperformance of inexpensive polycrystalline ferroelectric ceramics through\ndefect dipole engineering for a range of applications including piezoelectric\nsensors, actuators, and transducers.\n", "  The widely used ferroelectric ceramics based actuators always suffer from\nsmall output strains (typically ~0.1-0.15%). Non-180{\\deg} domain switching can\ngenerate large strain in ferroelectrics but it is usually irreversible. In this\nwork, we tailored the domain structures in a soft lead titanate zirconate (PZT)\nceramic by periodically orthogonal poling. The non-180{\\deg} switching in this\ndomain-engineered PZT ceramics turns to be reversible, resulting in giant\nelectrostrains up to 0.57% under a field of 2kV/mm (dynamic d33*(=S/E) of\n2850pm/V). The large electrostrain keeps quite stable and even slightly\nincreases after 10000 cycles of loading, which is very promising for\nnext-generation large-strain actuators.\n", "  We point out that in the Standard Model (SM) there is no explanation why\n$|V_{23}|^2 + |V_{13}|^2$ is of order $10^{-3}$. A framework is described for\nexplaining this small mixing, involving the introduction of vector-like quarks.\nA symmetry is introduced so that at a first stage $V_{CKM} =\n1\\>\\!\\!\\!\\mathrm{I}$ and only the third generation of quarks acquires a mass.\nIt is shown that when interactions of vector-like quarks are taken into account\na realistic quark mass spectrum is generated together with a correct $V_{CKM}$\nmatrix.\n", "  A compressed spectrum is an anticipated hideout for many beyond standard\nmodel scenarios. Such a spectrum naturally arises in the minimal universal\nextra dimension framework and also in supersymmetric scenarios. Low $p_T$\nleptons and jets are characteristic features of such situations. Hence, a\nmonojet with $\\not E_T$ has been the conventional signal at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). However, we stress that inclusion of $p_T$-binned track\nobservables from such soft objects provide very efficient discrimination of new\nphysics signals against various SM backgrounds. We consider two benchmark\npoints each for minimal universal extra dimension (MUED) and minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model (MSSM) scenarios. We perform a detailed cut-based\nand multivariate analysis (MVA) to show that the new physics parameter space\ncan be probed in the ongoing run of LHC at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy with an\nintegrated luminosity $\\sim$ 20-50 fb$^{-1}$. When studied in conjunction with\nthe dark matter relic density constraint assuming standard cosmology, we find\nthat compressed MUED (with $\\Lambda R=2$) can be already excluded from the\nexisting data. Also, MVA turns out to be a better technique than regular\ncut-based analysis since tracks provide uncorrelated observables which would\nextract more information from an event.\n", "  We study the Dynamical Casimir Effect resulting from the oscillatory motion\nof either one or two flat semitransparent mirrors, coupled to a quantum real\nand massless scalar field. Our approach is based on a perturbative evaluation,\nin the coupling between mirrors and field, of the corresponding effective\naction, which is used to compute the particle creation rate. The amplitude of\nthe oscillation is not necessarily small. We first obtain results for a single\nmirror, both for non-relativistic and relativistic motions, showing that only\nfor the latter the effects may be significant. For two mirrors, on the other\nhand, we show that there are interesting interference effects, and that in some\nparticular cases the results differ from those obtained assuming small\namplitudes, already for non-relativistic motions.\n", "  The radiation emission from electrons wiggling in a laser wakefield\nacceleration (LWFA) process, being initially considered as a parasitic effect\nfor the electron energy gain, can eventually serve as a novel X-ray source,\nthat could be used for diagnostic purposes. Although several schemes for\nenhancing the X-ray emission in LWFA has been recently proposed and analyzed,\nfinding an efficient way to use and control these radiation emissions remains\nan important problem. Based on analytical estimates and 3D particle-in-cell\nsimulations, we here propose and examine a new method utilizing two colliding\nLWFA patterns with an angle in-between their propagation directions. Varying\nthe angle of collision, the distance of acceleration before the collision and\nother parameters provide an unprecedented control over the emission parameters.\nMoreover, we reveal here that for a collision angle of 5$^\\circ$, the two\nwakefields merge into a single LWFA cavity inducing strong and stable\ncollective oscillations between the two trapped electron bunches. This results\nin an X-ray emission which is strongly peaked, both in the spatial and\nfrequency domain. The basic concept of the proposed scheme may pave a way for\nusing LWFA radiation sources in many important applications, such as\nphase-contrast radiography.\n", "  A semi-relativistic density-functional theory that includes spin-orbit\ncouplings and Zeeman fields on equal footing with the electromagnetic\npotentials, is an appealing framework to develop a unified first-principles\ncomputational approach for non-collinear magnetism, spintronics, orbitronics,\nand topological states. The basic variables of this theory include the\nparamagnetic current and the spin-current density, besides the particle and the\nspin density, and the corresponding exchange-correlation (xc) energy functional\nis invariant under local U(1)$\\times$SU(2) gauge transformations. The xc-energy\nfunctional must be approximated to enable practical applications, but, contrary\nto the case of the standard density functional theory, finding simple\napproximations suited to deal with realistic atomistic inhomogeneities has been\na long-standing challenge. Here, we propose a way out of this impasse by\nshowing that approximate gauge-invariant functionals can be easily generated\nfrom existing approximate functionals of ordinary density-functional theory by\napplying a simple {\\it minimal substitution} on the kinetic energy density,\nwhich controls the short-range behavior of the exchange hole. Our proposal\nopens the way to the construction of approximate, yet non-empirical\nfunctionals, which do not assume weak inhomogeneity and should therefore have a\nwide range of applicability in atomic, molecular and condensed matter physics.\n", "  The CLAS and Hall A collaborations at Jefferson Laboratory have recently\nreleased new results for the ep->ep{\\gamma} reaction. We analyze these new data\nwithin the Generalized Parton Distribution formalism. Employing a fitter\nalgorithm introduced and used in earlier works, we are able to extract from\nthese data new constraints on the kinematical dependence of three Compton Form\nFactors. Based on experimental data, we subsequently extract the dependence of\nthe proton charge radius on the quarks longitudinal momentum fraction.\n", "  We show that couplings of the goldstino field, appearing when global\nsupersymmetry is broken, can always be described in superspace by means of a\nnilpotent chiral superfield $X$, satisfying $X^2=0$. This applies to both\nF-term and D-term supersymmetry breaking, even when the supersymmetry breaking\nmodel admits a linear description.\n", "  We give a semiclassical analysis of the average photon number as well as\nphoton number variance (Fano factor $F$) for a Josephson-junction (JJ) embedded\nmicrowave cavity system, where the JJ is subject to a fluctuating (i.e. noisy)\nbias voltage with finite dc average. Through the ac Josephson effect, the dc\nvoltage bias drives the effectively nonlinear microwave cavity mode into an\namplitude squeezed state ($F<1$), as has been established previously [A. D.\nArmour, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 247001 (2013)], but bias noise acts to\ndegrade this squeezing. We find that the sensitivity of the Fano factor to bias\nvoltage noise depends qualitatively on which stable fixed point regime the\nsystem is in for the corresponding classical nonlinear steady state dynamics.\nFurthermore, we show that the impact of voltage bias noise is most significant\nwhen the cavity is excited to states with large average photon number.\n", "  Motivated by the fact that the low-energy properties of the Kondo model can\nbe effectively simulated in spin chains, we study the realization of the effect\nwith bond impurities in ultracold bosonic lattices at half-filling. After\npresenting a discussion of the effective theory and of the mapping of the\nbosonic chain onto a lattice spin Hamiltonian, we provide estimates for the\nKondo length as a function of the parameters of the bosonic model. We point out\nthat the Kondo length can be extracted from the integrated real space\ncorrelation functions, which are experimentally accessible quantities in\nexperiments with cold atoms.\n", "  Time-independent gauge transformations are implemented in the canonical\nformalism by the Gauss law which is not covariant. The covariant form of Gauss\nlaw is conceptually important for studying asymptotic properties of the gauge\nfields. For QED in $3+1$ dimensions, we have developed a formalism for treating\nthe equations of motion (EOM) themselves as constraints, that is, constraints\non states using Peierls' quantization. They generate spacetime dependent gauge\ntransformations. We extend these results to the Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS)\nLagrangian. The surprising result is that the covariant Gauss law commutes with\nall observables: the gauge invariance of the Lagrangian gets trivialized upon\nquantization. The calculations do not fix a gauge. We also consider a novel\ngauge condition on test functions (not on quantum fields) which we name the\n\"quasi-self-dual gauge\" condition. It explicitly shows the mass spectrum of the\ntheory. In this version, no freedom remains for the gauge transformations: EOM\ncommute with all observables and are in the center of the algebra of\nobservables.\n", "  X-ray emission spectroscopy is emerging as an important complement to x-ray\nabsorption fine structure spectroscopy, providing a characterization of the\noccupied electronic density of states local to the species of interest. Here,\nwe present details of the design and performance of a compact x-ray emission\nspectrometer that uses a dispersive refocusing Rowland (DRR) circle geometry to\nachieve excellent performance for the 2 - 2.5 keV energy range. The DRR\napproach allows high energy resolution even for unfocused x-ray sources. This\nproperty enables high count rates in laboratory studies, comparable to those of\ninsertion-device beamlines at third-generation synchrotrons, despite use of\nonly a low-powered, conventional x-ray tube. The spectrometer, whose overall\nscale is set by use of a 10-cm diameter Rowland circle and a new small-pixel\nCMOS x-ray camera, is easily portable to synchrotron or x-ray free electron\nbeamlines. Photometrics from measurements at the Advanced Light Source show\nsomewhat higher overall instrumental efficiency than prior systems based on\nless tightly curved analyzer optics. In addition, the compact size of this\ninstrument lends itself to future multiplexing to gain large factors in net\ncollection efficiency, or its implementation in controlled gas gloveboxes\neither in the lab or in an endstation.\n", "  We achieve efficient shaping of superscattering by radially anisotropic\nnanowires relying on resonant multipolar interferences. It is shown that the\nradial anisotropy of refractive index can be employed to resonantly overlap\nelectric and magnetic multipoles of various orders, and as a result effective\nsuperscattering with different engineered angular patterns can be obtained. We\nfurther demonstrate that such superscattering shaping relying on unusual radial\nanisotropy parameters can be directly realised with isotropic multi-layered\nnanowires, which may shed new light to many fundamental researches and various\napplications related to scattering particles.\n", "  Methyl thionitrite CH$_3$SNO is an important model of S-nitrosated cysteine\naminoacid residue (CysNO), a ubiquitous biological S-nitrosothiol (RSNO)\ninvolved in numerous physiological processes. Here, we report accurate\nstructure and properties of CH$_3$SNO using accurate ab initio\nFeller-Peterson-Dixon (FPD) approach. The FPD scheme included CCSD(T)-F12/CBS\nextrapolated values, as well as corrections for the quadruple coupled cluster\nexcitations $\\Delta$(Q), core-valence$\\Delta$CV and scalar-relativistic\n$\\Delta$SR effects. The FPD scheme for the energetic parameters also included\nharmonic zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE) corrected for anharmonicity. The\nS-N bond length in cis-CH$_3$SNO is calculated as 1.814 {\\AA}, and its\ndissociation energy $D_0=32.4$ kcal/mol in the gas phase. The trans-CH$_3$SNO\nconformation is 1.2 kcal/mol less stable ($\\Delta E_0$) compared to\ncis-CH$_3$SNO, with a sizeable cis-trans isomerization barrier $\\Delta E_0^\\ne\n= 12.7$ kcal/mol. The paradox of the unusually long and weak S-N bond, and\nhindered rotation along the S-N bond, was rationalized via the detailed\nanalysis of the underlying electronic structure of the -SNO group using Natural\nResonance Theory (NRT). After the benchmarking of the density functional theory\n(DFT) methods against the FPD reference, we recommend mPW2PLYP and mPW2PLYPD\ndouble hybrid functionals for calculation of the geometric properties,\nvibrational frequencies and isomerization barriers of S-nitrosothiols, and PBE0\n(PBE0-GD3) hybrid functional for the S-N BDEs. The abovementioned DFT methods\nare capable of capturing the change in electronic structure and properties of\nthe -SNO fragment, when the CH$_3$SNO molecule is exposed to the influence of\nphysiologically feasible external electric field $F_Z$.\n", "  Graviton fluctuations induce strong non-perturbative infrared renormalization\neffects for the cosmological constant. The functional renormalization flow\ndrives a positive cosmological constant towards zero, solving the cosmological\nconstant problem without the need to tune parameters. We propose a simple\ncomputation of the graviton contribution to the flow of the effective potential\nfor scalar fields. Within variable gravity we find that the potential increases\nasymptotically at most quadratically with the scalar field. With effective\nPlanck mass proportional to the scalar field, the solutions of the derived\ncosmological equations lead to an asymptotically vanishing cosmological\n\"constant\" in the infinite future, providing for dynamical dark energy in the\npresent cosmological epoch. Beyond a solution of the cosmological constant\nproblem, our simplified computation also entails a sizeable positive\ngraviton-induced anomalous dimension for the quartic Higgs coupling in the\nultraviolet regime, substantiating the successful prediction of the Higgs boson\nmass within the asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity.\n", "  The magnetron-style $H^{-}$ ion sources currently in operation at Fermilab\nuse piezoelectric gas valves to function. This kind of gas valve is sensitive\nto small changes in ambient temperature, which affect the stability and\nperformance of the ion source. This motivates the need to find an alternative\nway of feeding H2 gas into the source. A solenoid-type gas valve has been\ncharacterized in a dedicated off-line test stand to assess the feasibility of\nits use in the operational ion sources. $H^{-}$ ion beams have been extracted\nat 35 keV using this valve. In this study, the performance of the solenoid gas\nvalve has been characterized measuring the beam current output of the magnetron\nsource with respect to the voltage and pulse width of the signal applied to the\ngas valve.\n", "  This paper will detail changes in the operational paradigm of the Fermi\nNational Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) magnetron $H^{-}$ ion source due to\nupgrades in the accelerator system. Prior to November of 2012 the $H^{-}$ ions\nfor High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments were extracted at ~18 keV vertically\ndownward into a 90 degree bending magnet and accelerated through a\nCockcroft-Walton accelerating column to 750 keV. Following the upgrade in the\nfall of 2012 the $H^{-}$ ions are now directly extracted from a magnetron at 35\nkeV and accelerated to 750 keV by a Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ). This\nchange in extraction energy as well as the orientation of the ion source\nrequired not only a redesign of the ion source, but an updated understanding of\nits operation at these new values. Discussed in detail are the changes to the\nion source timing, arc discharge current, hydrogen gas pressure, and cesium\ndelivery system that were needed to maintain consistent operation at >99%\nuptime for HEP, with an increased ion source lifetime of over 9 months.\n", "  The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) is a modification of Heisenberg's\nPrinciple predicted by several theories of Quantum Gravity. It consists of a\nmodified commutator between position and momentum. In this work we compute\npotentially observable effects that GUP implies for the harmonic oscillator,\ncoherent and squeezed states in Quantum Mechanics. In particular, we rigorously\nanalyze the GUP-perturbed harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, defining new\noperators that act as ladder operators on the perturbed states. We use these\noperators to define the new coherent and squeezed states. We comment on\npotential applications.\n", "  Although molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are commonly used to predict the\nstructure and properties of glasses, they are intrinsically limited to short\ntime scales, necessitating the use of fast cooling rates. It is therefore\nchallenging to compare results from MD simulations to experimental results for\nglasses cooled on typical laboratory time scales. Based on MD simulations of a\nsodium silicate glass with varying cooling rate (from 0.01 to 100 K/ps), here\nwe show that thermal history primarily affects the medium-range order\nstructure, while the short-range order is largely unaffected over the range of\ncooling rates simulated. This results in a decoupling between the enthalpy and\nvolume relaxation functions, where the enthalpy quickly plateaus as the cooling\nrate decreases, whereas density exhibits a slower relaxation. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that the outcomes of MD simulations can be meaningfully compared to\nexperimental values if properly extrapolated to slower cooling rates.\n", "  We develop a formalism where the hard and soft pomeron contributions to high\nenergy scattering arise as leading Regge poles of a single kernel in\nholographic QCD. The kernel is obtained using effective field theory inspired\nby Regge theory of a 5-d string theory. It describes the exchange of higher\nspin fields in the graviton Regge trajectory that are dual to glueball states\nof twist two. For a specific holographic QCD model we describe Deep Inelastic\nScattering in the Regge limit of low Bjorken x, finding good agreement with\nexperimental data from HERA. The observed rise of the effective pomeron\nintercept, as the size of the probe decreases, is reproduced by considering the\nfirst four pomeron trajectories. In the case of soft probes, relevant to total\ncross sections, the leading hard pomeron trajectory is suppressed, such that in\nthis kinematical region we reproduce an intercept of 1.09 compatible with the\nQCD soft pomeron data. In the spectral region of positive Maldelstam variable t\nthe first two pomeron trajectories are consistent with current expectations for\nthe glueball spectrum from lattice simulations.\n", "  This paper will cover several studies and design changes that will eventually\nbe implemented to the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) magnetron\nion source. The topics include tungsten cathode insert, solenoid gas valves,\ncurrent controlled arc pulser, cesium boiler redesign, gas mixtures of hydrogen\nand nitrogen, and duty factor reduction. The studies were performed on the FNAL\ntest stand, with the aim to improve source lifetime, stability, and reducing\nthe amount of tuning needed.\n", "  The structure of $d^*(2380)$ is re-studied with the single cluster structure\nin the chiral SU(3) quark model which has successfully been employed to explain\nthe $N-N$ scattering data and the binding energy of deuteron. The binding\nbehavior of such a six quark system is solved by using a variational method.\nThe trial wave function is chosen to be a combination of a basic spherical\nsymmetric component of $[(0s)^6]_{orb}$ in the orbital space with\n$0\\hbar\\omega$ excitation and an inner structural deformation component of\n$[(0s)^5(1s)]_{orb}$ and $[(0s)^4(0p)^2]_{orb}$ in the orbital space with\n$2\\hbar\\omega$ excitation, both of which are in the spatial [6] symmetry. It is\nshown that the mass of the system is about $2356$ MeV, which is qualitative\nconsistent with the result both from the two-cluster configuration calculation\nand from the data measured by the WASA Collaborations. This result tells us\nthat as long as the medium-range interaction due to the chiral symmetry\nconsideration is properly introduced, the mass of system will be reduced in a\nrather large extent. It also implies that the observed $d^*$ is a six-quark\nbound state with respect to the $\\Delta\\Delta$ threshold, which again supports\nthe conclusion that $d^*$ is a hexaquark dominant state.\n", "  Early observations of supernovae (SNe) indicate that enhanced mass loss and\npre-SN outbursts may occur in progenitors of many types of SNe. We investigate\nthe role of energy transport via waves driven by vigorous convection during\nlate-stage nuclear burning of otherwise typical $15 \\, M_\\odot$ red supergiant\nSNe progenitors. Using MESA stellar evolution models including 1D\nhydrodynamics, we find that waves carry $\\sim \\! 10^7 \\, L_\\odot$ of power from\nthe core to the envelope during core neon/oxygen burning in the final years\nbefore core collapse. The waves damp via shocks and radiative diffusion at the\nbase of the hydrogen envelope, which heats up fast enough to launch a pressure\nwave into the overlying envelope that steepens into a weak shock near the\nstellar surface, causing a mild stellar outburst and ejecting a small\n($\\lesssim 1 \\, M_\\odot$) amount of mass at low speed ($\\lesssim \\! 50 \\, {\\rm\nkm}/{\\rm s}$) roughly one year before the SN. The wave heating inflates the\nstellar envelope but does not completely unbind it, producing a non-hydrostatic\npre-SN envelope density structure different from prior expectations. In our\nmodels, wave heating is unlikely to lead to luminous type IIn SNe, but it may\ncontribute to flash-ionized SNe and some of the diversity seen in II-P/II-L\nSNe.\n", "  We compute holographic R\\'enyi entropies for spherical entangling surfaces on\nthe boundary while considering third order Lovelock gravity with negative\ncosmological constant in the bulk. Our study shows that third order Lovelock\nblack holes with hyperbolic event horizon are unstable, and at low temperatures\nthose with smaller mass are favoured, giving rise to first order phase\ntransitions in the bulk. We determine regions in the Lovelock parameter space\nin arbitrary dimensions, where bulk phase transitions happen and where boundary\ncausality constraints are met. We show that each of these points corresponds to\na dual boundary conformal field theory whose R\\'enyi entropy exhibits a kink at\na certain critical index $n$.\n", "  Deep ultraviolet (UV) optical emission below 250 nm (~5 eV) in semiconductors\nis traditionally obtained from high aluminum containing AlGaN alloy quantum\nwells. It is shown here that high-quality epitaxial ultrathin binary GaN\nquantum disks embedded in an AlN matrix can produce efficient optical emission\nin the 219-235 nm (~5.7 to 5.3 eV) spectral range, far above the bulk bandgap\n(3.4 eV) of GaN. The quantum confinement energy in these heterostructures is\nlarger than the bandgaps of traditional semiconductors, made possible by the\nlarge band offsets. These MBE-grown extreme quantum-confinement GaN/AlN\nheterostructures exhibit internal quantum efficiency as high as 40% at\nwavelengths as short as 219 nm. These observations, together with the ability\nto engineer the interband optical matrix elements to control the direction of\nphoton emission in such new binary quantum disk active regions offers unique\nadvantages over alloy AlGaN quantum well counterparts for the realization of\ndeep-UV light-emitting diodes and lasers.\n", "  The PIP2IT test accelerator is under construction at Fermilab. Its ion source\nand Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) in its initial (straight) configuration\nhave been commissioned to full specification parameters. This paper introduces\nthe LEBT design and summarizes the outcome of the commissioning activities.\n", "  Nuclei with spin $I \\ge 1$ have a weak quadrupole moment which leads to\ntensor contribution to the parity non-conserving interaction between nuclei and\nelectrons. We calculate this contribution for Yb$^+$, Fr and Ra$^+$ and found\nit to be small. In contrast, in many lanthanides (e.g., Nd, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Pr,\nSm) and Ra close levels of opposite parity lead to strong enhancement of the\neffect making it sufficiently large to be measured. Another possibility is to\nmeasure the PNC transitions between the hyperfine components of the ground\nstate of Bi. Since nuclear weak charge is dominated by neutrons this opens a\nway of measuring quadrupole moments of neutron distribution in nuclei.\n", "  Ion acceleration using a laser pulse irradiating a thin disk target is\nexamined using three-dimensional and two-dimensional particle-in-cell\nsimulations. A laser pulse of $620$ TW, with an intensity of $5\\times 10^{21}$\nW/cm$^{2}$ and a duration time of $27$ fs is irradiated on a double-layer\ntarget. Simulations are performed by varying the ion density, i.e., electron\ndensity, of the first layer. It is shown that the obtained proton energy jumps\nat a certain density of the first layer, which is made of a \"light\" material\nsuch as carbon; that is, Coulomb explosion of the target and radiation pressure\nacceleration act effectively above a certain density. Moreover, even at the\nsame electron density, the reflection of the laser pulse from the first layer\nis small for a \"light\" material.\n", "  Gaia Data Release 1 contains parallaxes for more than 700 Galactic Cepheids\nand RR Lyrae stars, computed as part of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution\n(TGAS). We have used TGAS parallaxes, along with literature ($V, I, J,\n{K_\\mathrm{s}}, W_1$) photometry and spectroscopy, to calibrate the zero point\nof the Period-Luminosity and Period-Wesenheit relations of classical and type\nII Cepheids, and the near-infrared Period-Luminosity,\nPeriod-Luminosity-Metallicity and optical Luminosity-Metallicity relations of\nRR Lyrae stars. In this contribution we briefly summarise results obtained by\nfitting these basic relations adopting different techniques that operate either\nin parallax or distance (absolute magnitude) space.\n", "  A lattice model for active matter is studied numerically, showing that it\ndisplays wettings transitions between three distinctive phases when in contact\nwith an impenetrable wall. The particles in the model move persistently,\ntumbling with a small rate $\\alpha$, and interact via exclusion volume only.\nWhen increasing the tumbling rates $\\alpha$, the system transits from total\nwetting to partial wetting and unwetting phases. In the first phase, a wetting\nfilm covers the wall, with increasing heights when $\\alpha$ is reduced. The\nsecond phase is characterized by wetting droplets on the wall with a periodic\nspacing between them. Finally, the wall dries with few particles in contact\nwith it. These phases present nonequilibrium transitions. The first transition,\nfrom partial to total wetting, is continuous and the fraction of dry sites\nvanishes continuously when decreasing the tumbling rate $\\alpha$. For the\nsecond transition, from partial wetting to dry, the mean droplet distance\ndiverges logarithmically when approaching the critical tumbling rate, with\nsaturation due to finite-size effects.\n", "  We revised the large-$N$ expansion for a three-dimensional Bose system with\nshort-range repulsion in normal phase. Particularly, for the model potential\nthat is characterised only by the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ the full\nnumerical calculations of the critical temperature in the $1/N$-approximation\nas a function of the gas parameter $an^{1/3}$ are performed. Additionally to\nthe well-known result in the dilute limit we estimated analytically the\nleading-order strong-coupling behavior of the Bose-Einstein condensation\ntransition temperature. It is shown that the critical temperature shift of the\nnon-ideal Bose gas grows at small $an^{1/3}$, reaches some maximal value and\nthen falls down becoming negative.\n", "  We investigate the impact of flavour-conserving, non-universal quark-lepton\ncontact interactions on the dilepton invariant mass distribution in $p~p \\to\n\\ell^+ \\ell^-$ processes at the LHC. After recasting the recent ATLAS search\nperformed at 13 TeV with 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of data, we derive the best up-to-date\nlimits on the full set of 36 relevant four-fermion operators, as well as\nestimate the sensitivity achievable at the HL-LHC. We discuss how these\nhigh-$p_T$ measurements can provide complementary information to the low-$p_T$\nrare meson decays. In particular, we find that the recent hints on lepton\nflavour universality violation in $b \\to s \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ transitions are already\nin mild tension with the dimuon spectrum at high-$p_T$ if the flavour structure\nfollows minimal flavour violation. Even if the mass scale of New Physics is\nwell beyond the kinematical reach for on-shell production, the signal in the\nhigh-$p_T$ dilepton tail might still be observed, a fact that has been often\noverlooked in the present literature. In scenarios where new physics couples\npredominantly to third generation quarks, instead, the HL-LHC phase is\nnecessary in order to provide valuable information.\n", "  In this paper we use a formal discrete-to-continuum procedure to derive a\ncontinuum variational model for two chains of atoms with slightly\nincommensurate lattices. The chains represent a cross-section of a\nthree-dimensional system consisting of a graphene sheet suspended over a\nsubstrate. The continuum model recovers both qualitatively and quantitatively\nthe behavior observed in the corresponding discrete model. The numerical\nsolutions for both models demonstrate the presence of large commensurate\nregions separated by localized incommensurate domain walls.\n", "  We investigate the dimensional dependence of dynamical fluctuations related\nto dynamic heterogeneity in supercooled liquid systems using kinetically\nconstrained models. The $d$-dimensional spin-facilitated East model with\nembedded probe particles is used as a representative super-Arrhenius glass\nforming system. We investigate the existence of an upper critical dimension in\nthis model by considering decoupling of transport rates through an effective\nfractional Stokes-Einstein relation, $D\\sim{\\tau}^{-1+\\omega}$, with $D$ and\n$\\tau$ the diffusion constant of the probe particle and the relaxation time of\nthe model liquid, respectively, and where $\\omega > 0$ encodes the breakdown of\nthe standard Stokes-Einstein relation. To the extent that decoupling indicates\nnon mean-field behavior, our simulations suggest that the East model has an\nupper critical dimension which is at least above $d=10$, and argue that it may\nbe actually be infinite. This result is due to the existence of hierarchical\ndynamics in the East model in any finite dimension. We discuss the relevance of\nthese results for studies of decoupling in high dimensional atomistic models.\n", "  Transient quantum dynamics in an interacting fermion-phonon system are\ninvestigated. In particular, a charge order (CO) melting after a short\noptical-pulse irradiation and roles of the quantum phonons on the transient\ndynamics are focused on. A spinless-fermion model in a one-dimensional chain\ncoupled with local phonons is analyzed numerically. The infinite time-evolving\nblock decimation algorithm is adopted as a reliable numerical method for\none-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Numerical results for the\nphotoinduced CO melting dynamics without phonons are well interpreted by the\nsoliton picture for the CO domains. This interpretation is confirmed by the\nnumerical simulation for an artificial local excitation and the classical\nsoliton model. In the case of the large phonon frequency corresponding to the\nantiadiabatic condition, the CO melting is induced by propagations of the\npolaronic solitons with the renormalized soliton velocity. On the other hand,\nin the case of the small phonon frequency corresponding to the adiabatic\ncondition, the first stage of the CO melting dynamics occurs due to the energy\ntransfer from the fermionic to phononic systems, and the second stage is\nbrought about by the soliton motions around the bottom of the soliton band.\nPresent analyses provide a standard reference for the photoinduced CO melting\ndynamics in low-dimensional many-body quantum systems.\n", "  In this paper we demonstrate, that the light-cone lattice approach for the\nMassive-Thirring (sine-Gordon) model, through the quantum inverse scattering\nmethod, admits an appropriate framework for computing the finite volume\nform-factors of local operators of the model. In this work we compute the\nfinite volume diagonal matrix elements of the $U(1)$ conserved current in the\npure soliton sector of the theory. Based on the systematic large volume\nexpansion of our results, we conjecture an exact expression for the finite\nvolume expectation values of local operators in pure soliton states. At large\nvolume in leading order these expectation values have the same form as in\npurely elastic scattering theories, but exponentially small corrections differ\nfrom previous Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz conjectures of purely elastic\nscattering theories.\n", "  The LHC has recently released precise measurements of the transverse momentum\ndistribution of the Z-boson that provide a unique constraint on the structure\nof the proton. Theoretical developments now allow the prediction of these\nobservables through next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD.\nIn this work we study the impact of incorporating these latest advances into a\ndetermination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) through NNLO including\nthe recent ATLAS and CMS 7 TeV and 8 TeV $p_T^Z$ data. We investigate the\nconsistency of these measurements in a global fit to the available data and\nquantify the impact of including the $p_T^Z$ distributions on the PDFs. The\ninclusion of these new data sets significantly reduces the uncertainties on\nselect parton distributions and the corresponding parton-parton luminosities.\nIn particular, we find that the $p_T^Z$ data ultimately leads to a reduction of\nthe PDF uncertainty on the gluon-fusion and vector-boson fusion Higgs\nproduction cross sections by about 30%, while keeping the central values nearly\nunchanged.\n", "  We review theoretical aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at finite\ntemperature. The most important physical variable to characterize hot QCD is\nthe Polyakov loop, which is an approximate order parameter for quark\ndeconfinement in a hot gluonic medium. Additionally to its role as an order\nparameter, the Polyakov loop has rich physical contents in both perturbative\nand non-perturbative sectors. This review covers a wide range of subjects\nassociated with the Polyakov loop from topological defects in hot QCD to model\nbuilding with coupling to the Polyakov loop.\n", "  We test the impact of using variable star forming histories (SFHs) and the\nuse of the IR luminosity (LIR) as a constrain on the physical parameters of\nhigh redshift dusty star-forming galaxies. We explore in particular the stellar\nproperties of galaxies in relation with their location on the SFR-M* diagram.\nWe perform SED fitting of the UV-NIR and FIR emissions of a large sample of\nGOODS-Herschel galaxies, for which rich multi-wavelength observations are\navailable. We test different SFHs and imposing energy conservation in the SED\nfitting process, to face issues like the age-extinction degeneracy and produce\nSEDs consistent with observations. Our models work well for the majority of the\nsample, with the notable exception of the high LIR end, for which we have\nindications that our simple energy conservation approach cannot hold true. We\nfind trends in the SFHs fitting our sources depending on stellar mass M* and z.\nTrends also emerge in the characteristic timescales of the SED models depending\non the location on the SFR-M* diagram. We show that whilst using the same\navailable observational data, we can produce galaxies less star-forming than\nusually inferred, if we allow declining SFHs, while properly reproducing their\nobservables. These sources can be post-starbursts undergoing quenching, and\ntheir SFRs are potentially overestimated if inferred from their LIR. Fitting\nwithout the IR constrain leads to a strong preference for declining SFHs, while\nits inclusion increases the preference of rising SFHs, more so at high z, in\ntentative agreement with the cosmic star formation history. Keeping in mind\nthat the sample is biased towards high LIR, the evolution shaped by our model\nappears as both bursty (initially) and steady-lasting (later on). The global\nSFH of the sample follows the cosmic SFH with a small scatter, and is\ncompatible with the \"downsizing\" scenario of galaxy evolution.\n", "  We apply three forward light-by-light scattering sum rules to charmonium\nstates. We show that these sum rules imply a cancellation between charmonium\nbound state contributions, which are mostly known from the $\\gamma \\gamma$\ndecay widths of these states, and continuum contributions above $D \\bar D$\nthreshold, for which we provide a duality estimate. We also show that two of\nthese sum rules allow to predict the yet unmeasured $\\gamma^\\ast \\gamma$\ncoupling of the $\\chi_{c1}(1P)$ state, which can be tested at present\nhigh-luminosity $e^+ e^-$ colliders.\n", "  The Galactic habitable zone is defined as the region with highly enough\nmetallicity to form planetary systems in which Earth-like planets could be born\nand might be capable of sustaining life surviving to the destructive effects of\nnearby supernova explosion events. Galactic chemical evolution models can be\nuseful tools for studying the galactic habitable zones in different systems.\nOur aim here is to find the Galactic habitable zone using chemical evolution\nmodels for the Milky Way disc, adopting the most recent prescriptions for the\nevolution of dust and for the probability of finding planetary systems around M\nand FGK stars. Moreover, for the first time, we will express those\nprobabilities in terms of the dust-to-gas ratio of the ISM in the solar\nneighborhood as computed by detailed chemical evolution models. At a fixed\nGalactic time and Galactocentric distance we determine the number of M and FGK\nstars having Earths (but no gas giant planets) which survived supernova\nexplosions, using the formalism of our Paper I. The probabilities of finding\nterrestrial planets but not gas giant planets around M stars deviate\nsubstantially from the ones around FGK stars for supersolar values of [Fe/H].\nFor both FGK and M stars the maximum number of stars hosting habitable planets\nis at 8 kpc from the Galactic Centre, if destructive effects by supernova\nexplosions are taken into account. At the present time the total number of M\nstars with habitable planets are $\\simeq$ 10 times the number of FGK stars.\nMoreover, we provide a sixth order polynomial fit (and a linear one but more\napproximated) for the relation found with chemical evolution models in the\nsolar neighborhood between the [Fe/H] abundances and the dust-to-gas ratio.\n", "  The main properties of the climate of waves in the seasonally ice-covered\nBaltic Sea and its decadal changes since 1990 are estimated from satellite\naltimetry data. The data set of significant wave heights (SWH) from all\nexisting nine satellites, cleaned and cross-validated against in situ\nmeasurements, shows overall a very consistent picture. A comparison with visual\nobservations shows a good correspondence with correlation coefficients of\n0.6-0.8. The annual mean SWH reveals a tentative increase of 0.005 m yr-1, but\nhigher quantiles behave in a cyclic manner with a timescale of 10-15 yr.\nChanges in the basin-wide average SWH have a strong meridional pattern: an\nincrease in the central and western parts of the sea and decrease in the east.\nThis pattern is likely caused by a rotation of wind directions rather than by\nan increase in the wind speed.\n", "  We have determined the structural and lattice dynamical properties of the\northorhombic, wide band gap semiconductors MgSiN$_{2}$ and MgGeN$_{2}$ using\ndensity functional theory. In addition, we present structural properties and\nRaman spectra of a MgSiN$_{2}$ powder. The structural properties and lattice\ndynamics of the orthorhombic systems are compared to wurtzite AlN. We find\nclear differences in the lattice dynamics between MgSiN$_{2}$, MgGeN$_{2}$ and\nAlN, for example we find that the highest phonon frequency in MgSiN$_{2}$ is\nabout 100~cm$^{-1}$ higher than the highest frequency in AlN and that\nMgGeN$_{2}$ is much softer. We also provide the Born effective charge tensors\nand dielectric tensors of MgSiN$_{2}$, MgGeN$_{2}$ and AlN. Phonon related\nthermodynamic properties, such as the heat capacity and entropy, are in very\ngood agreement with available experimental results.\n", "  Quantum state tomography is an indispensable but costly part of many quantum\nexperiments. Typically, it requires measurements to be carried in a number of\ndifferent settings on a fixed experimental setup. The collected data is often\ninformationally overcomplete, with the amount of information redundancy\ndepending on the particular set of measurement settings chosen. This raises a\nquestion about how should one optimally take data so that the number of\nmeasurement settings necessary can be reduced. Here, we cast this problem in\nterms of integer programming. For a given experimental setup, standard integer\nprogramming algorithms allow us to find the minimum set of readout operations\nthat can realize a target tomographic task. We apply the method to certain\nbasic and practical state tomographic problems in nuclear magnetic resonance\nexperimental systems. The results show that, considerably less readout\noperations can be found using our technique than it was by using the previous\ngreedy search strategy. Therefore, our method could be helpful for simplifying\nmeasurement schemes so as to minimize the experimental effort.\n", "  We study large $N$ tensor models on the lattice without disorder. We\nintroduce techniques which can be applied to a wide class of models, and\nillustrate it by studying some specific rank-3 tensor models. In particular, we\nstudy Klebanov-Tarnopolsky model on lattice, Gurau-Witten model (by treating it\nas a tensor model on four sites) and also a new model which interpolates\nbetween these two models. In each model, we evaluate various four point\nfunctions at large $N$ and strong coupling, and discuss their spectrum and long\ntime behaviors. We find similarities as well as differences from SYK model. We\nalso generalize our analysis to rank-$D$ tensor models where we obtain\nanalogous results as $D=3$ case for the four point functions which we computed.\nFor $D>5$, we are able to compute the next-to-subleading ${1 \\over N}$\ncorrections for a specific four point function.\n", "  We present results on the dust attenuation of galaxies at redshift $\\sim3-6$\nby studying the relationship between the UV spectral slope ($\\beta_{\\rm UV}$)\nand the infrared excess (IRX; $L_{\\rm IR}$/$L_{\\rm UV}$) using ALMA\nfar-infrared continuum observations. Our study is based on a sample of 67\nmassive, star-forming galaxies with a median mass of $M_{\\ast}\\sim\n10^{10.7}\\,M_{\\rm \\odot}$ spanning a redshift range $z=2.6-3.7$ (median\n$z=3.2$) that were observed with ALMA at $\\lambda_{rest}=300\\,{\\rm \\mu m}$.\nBoth the individual ALMA detections (41 sources) and stacks including all\ngalaxies show the IRX-$\\beta_{\\rm UV}$ relationship at $z\\sim3$ is mostly\nconsistent with that of local starburst galaxies on average. However, we find\nevidence for a large dispersion around the mean relationship by up to $\\pm0.5$\ndex. Nevertheless, the locally calibrated dust correction factors based on the\nIRX-$\\beta_{\\rm UV}$ relation are on average applicable to main-sequence\n$z\\sim3$ galaxies. This does not appear to be the case at even higher\nredshifts, however. Using public ALMA observations of $z\\sim4-6$ galaxies we\nfind evidence for a significant evolution in the IRX-$\\beta_{\\rm UV}$ and the\nIRX-$M_{\\ast}$ relations beyond $z\\sim3$ toward lower IRX values. We discuss\nseveral caveats that could affect these results, including the assumed dust\ntemperature. ALMA observations of larger $z>3$ galaxy samples will be required\nto confirm this intriguing redshift evolution.\n", "  Short-range charge-density wave correlations are ubiquitous in underdoped\ncuprates. They are largely confined to the copper-oxygen planes and typically\noscillate out of phase from one unit cell to the next in the c-direction.\nRecently, it was found that a considerably longer-range charge-density wave\norder develops in YBCO above a sharply defined crossover magnetic field. This\norder is more three-dimensional and is in-phase along the c-axis. Here, we show\nthat such behavior is a consequence of the conflicting ordering tendencies\ninduced by the disorder potential and the Coulomb interaction, where the\nmagnetic field acts to tip the scales from the former to the latter. We base\nour conclusion on analytic large-N analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations of a\nnon-linear sigma model of competing superconducting and charge-density wave\norders. Our results are in agreement with the observed phenomenology in the\ncuprates, and we discuss their implications to other members of this family,\nwhich have not been measured yet at high magnetic fields.\n", "  We derive integrable equations starting from autonomous mappings with a\ngeneral form inspired by the multiplicative systems associated to the affine\nWeyl group E$_8^{(1)}$. Five such systems are obtained, three of which turn out\nto be linearisable and the remaining two are integrable in terms of elliptic\nfunctions. In the case of the linearisable mappings we derive nonautonomous\nforms which contain a free function of the dependent variable and we present\nthe linearisation in each case. The two remaining systems are deautonomised to\nnew discrete Painlev\\'e equations. We show that these equations are in fact\nspecial forms of much richer systems associated to the affine Weyl groups\nE$_7^{(1)}$ and E$_8^{(1)}$ respectively.\n", "  The motion of a viscous deformable droplet suspended in an unbounded\nPoiseuille flow in the presence of bulk-insoluble surfactants is studied\nanalytically. Assuming the convective transport of fluid and heat to be\nnegligible, we perform a small-deformation perturbation analysis to obtain the\ndroplet migration velocity. The droplet dynamics strongly depends on the\ndistribution of surfactants along the droplet interface, which is governed by\nthe relative strength of convective transport of surfactants as compared with\nthe diffusive transport of surfactants. The present study is focused on the\nfollowing two limits: (i) when the surfactant transport is dominated by surface\ndiffusion, and (ii) when the surfactant transport is dominated by surface\nconvection. In the first limiting case, it is seen that the axial velocity of\nthe droplet decreases with increase in the advection of the surfactants along\nthe surface. The variation of cross-stream migration velocity, on the other\nhand, is analyzed over three different regimes based on the ratio of the\nviscosity of the droplet phase to that of the carrier phase. In the first\nregime the migration velocity decreases with increase in surface advection of\nthe surfactants although there is no change in direction of droplet migration.\nFor the second regime, the direction of the cross-stream migration of the\ndroplet changes depending on different parameters. In the third regime, the\nmigration velocity is merely affected by any change in the surfactant\ndistribution. For the other limit of higher surface advection in comparison to\nsurface diffusion of the surfactants, the axial velocity of the droplet is\nfound to be independent of the surfactant distribution. However, the\ncross-stream velocity is found to decrease with increase in non-uniformity in\nsurfactant distribution.\n", "  Overfitting, which happens when the number of parameters in a model is too\nlarge compared to the number of data points available for determining these\nparameters, is a serious and growing problem in survival analysis. While modern\nmedicine presents us with data of unprecedented dimensionality, these data\ncannot yet be used effectively for clinical outcome prediction. Standard error\nmeasures in maximum likelihood regression, such as p-values and z-scores, are\nblind to overfitting, and even for Cox's proportional hazards model (the main\ntool of medical statisticians), one finds in literature only rules of thumb on\nthe number of samples required to avoid overfitting. In this paper we present a\nmathematical theory of overfitting in regression models for time-to-event data,\nwhich aims to increase our quantitative understanding of the problem and\nprovide practical tools with which to correct regression outcomes for the\nimpact of overfitting. It is based on the replica method, a statistical\nmechanical technique for the analysis of heterogeneous many-variable systems\nthat has been used successfully for several decades in physics, biology, and\ncomputer science, but not yet in medical statistics. We develop the theory\ninitially for arbitrary regression models for time-to-event data, and verify\nits predictions in detail for the popular Cox model.\n", "  We use a functional renormalization group equation tailored to the\nArnowitt-Deser-Misner formulation of gravity to study the scale-dependence of\nNewton's coupling and the cosmological constant on a background spacetime with\ntopology S^1xS^d. The resulting beta functions possess a non-trivial\nrenormalization group fixed point, which may provide the high-energy completion\nof the theory through the asymptotic safety mechanism. The fixed point is\nrobust with respect to changing the parametrization of the metric fluctuations\nand regulator scheme. The phase diagrams show that this fixed point is\nconnected to a classical regime through a crossover. In addition the flow may\nexhibit a regime of \"gravitational instability\", modifying the theory in the\ndeep infrared. Our work complements earlier studies of the gravitational\nrenormalization group flow on a background topology S^1xT^d and establishes\nthat the flow is essentially independent of the background topology.\n", "  There is an ambiguity in the gauge group of the Standard Model. The group is\n$G = SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1)/\\Gamma$, where $\\Gamma$ is a subgroup of\n${\\bf Z}_6$ which cannot be determined by current experiments. We describe how\nthe electric, magnetic and dyonic line operators of the theory depend on the\nchoice of $\\Gamma$. We also explain how the periodicity of the theta angles,\nassociated to each factor of $G$, differ.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the supersymmetric localization of the 4D\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ off-shell gauged supergravity in the background of the\n$\\textrm{AdS}_4$ neutral topological black hole, which is the gravity dual of\nthe ABJM theory defined on the boundary $\\textrm{S}^1 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$. We\ncompute the large-$N$ expansion of the supergravity partition function. The\nresult gives the black hole entropy with the logarithmic correction, which\nmatches the previous result of the entanglement entropy of the ABJM theory up\nto some stringy effects. Our result is consistent with the previous on-shell\none-loop computation of the logarithmic correction to black hole entropy. It\nprovides an explicit example of the identification of the entanglement entropy\nof the boundary conformal field theory with the bulk black hole entropy beyond\nthe leading order given by the classical Bekenstein-Hawking formula, which\nconsequently tests the AdS/CFT correspondence at the subleading order.\n", "  We study the coupling of a 2+1 dimensional non-relativistic spin 1/2 fermion\nto a curved Newton-Cartan geometry, using null reduction from an\nextra-dimensional relativistic Dirac action in curved spacetime. We analyze\nWeyl invariance in detail: we show that at the classical level it is preserved\nin an arbitrary curved background, whereas at the quantum level it is broken by\nanomalies. We compute the trace anomaly using the Heat Kernel method and we\nshow that the anomaly coefficients a, c are proportional to the relativistic\nones for a Dirac fermion in 3+1 dimensions. As for the previously studied\nscalar case, these coefficents are proportional to 1/m, where m is the\nnon-relativistic mass of the particle.\n", "  We revisit the problem posed by an anharmonic oscillator with a potential\ngiven by a polynomial function of the coordinate of degree six that depends on\na parameter $\\lambda $. The ground state can be obtained exactly and its energy\n$E_{0}=1$ is independent of $\\lambda $. This solution is valid only for\n$\\lambda >0$ because the eigenfunction is not square integrable otherwise. Here\nwe show that the perturbation series for the expectation values are Pad\\'{e}\nand Borel-Pad\\'{e} summable for $\\lambda >0$. When $% \\lambda <0$ the spectrum\nexhibits an infinite number of avoided crossings at each of which the\neigenfunctions undergo dramatic changes in their spatial distribution that we\nanalyze by means of the expectation values $\\langle x^{2}\\rangle $.\n", "  We give a new expression for the supercurrent and its conservation in curved\n${\\cal N}=1$, $D=4$ superspace using the superconformal approach. The first\ncomponent of the superfield, whose lowest component is the vector auxiliary\nfield gives the (super)Einstein equations. Its trace and couplings to conformal\nand non-conformal matter is presented. In a suitable dilatational gauge, the\nconformal gauge, we obtain an update of the Callan-Coleman-Jackiw improved\ncurrents for conformal matter, containing $R$-symmetry corrections for a new\ntraceless covariantly conserved energy--momentum tensor. We observe that in the\nPoincar\\'e gauge, where standard Poincar\\'e supergravity is usually formulated,\nthe currents are not improved and then the higher conformal symmetry of the\nmatter sector is obscured. The curvature multiplets are used to find\nsupersymmetric curved backgrounds and some examples are exhibited in agreement\nwith existing results.\n", "  We have shown recently how to calculate the large deviation function of the\nposition $X_{\\max}(t) $ of the right most particle of a branching Brownian\nmotion at time $t$. This large deviation function exhibits a phase transition\nat a certain negative velocity. Here we extend this result to more general\nbranching random walks and show that the probability distribution of\n$X_{\\max}(t)$ has, asymptotically in time, a prefactor characterized by non\ntrivial power law.\n", "  Oscillating scalar fields are useful to model a variety of matter components\nin the universe. One or more scalar fields participate in the reheating process\nafter inflation, while at much lower energies scalar fields are robust dark\nmatter candidates. Pertaining structure formation in these models, it is well\nknown that inhomogeneities of the Klein-Gordon field are unstable above the\ncharacteristic De Broglie wavelength. In this paper we show that such\ninstability implies the existence of a threshold amplitude for the collapse of\nprimordial fluctuations. We use this threshold to correctly predict the\ncut--off scale of the matter power spectrum in the scalar field dark matter\nmodel. Furthermore, for a Klein-Gordon field during reheating we show that this\nsame threshold allows for abundant production of structure (oscillons but not\nnecessarily black holes). Looking at the production of Primordial Black Holes\n(PBHs) in this scenario we note that the sphericity condition yields a much\nlower probability of PBH formation at the end of inflation. Remarkably, even\nafter meeting such stringent condition, we find that PBHs may be overproduced\nduring reheating. We finally constrain the epochs at which an oscillating\nKlein-Gordon field could dominate the early universe.\n", "  The IceCube neutrino observatory has established the existence of a flux of\nhigh-energy astrophysical neutrinos inconsistent with the expectation from\natmospheric backgrounds at a significance greater than $5\\sigma$. This flux has\nbeen observed in analyses of both track events from muon neutrino interactions\nand cascade events from interactions of all neutrino flavors. Searches for\nastrophysical neutrino sources have focused on track events due to the\nsignificantly better angular resolution of track reconstructions. To date, no\nsuch sources have been confirmed. Here we present the first search for\nastrophysical neutrino sources using cascades interacting in IceCube with\ndeposited energies as small as 1 TeV. No significant clustering was observed in\na selection of 263 cascades collected from May 2010 to May 2012. We show that\ncompared to the classic approach using tracks, this statistically-independent\nsearch offers improved sensitivity to sources in the southern sky, especially\nif the emission is spatially extended or follows a soft energy spectrum. This\nenhancement is due to the low background from atmospheric neutrinos forming\ncascade events and the additional veto of atmospheric neutrinos at declinations\n$\\lesssim-30^\\circ$.\n", "  The puzzle of $R(D^{(*)})$ associated with $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ decay is\naddressed in the two-HIggs-doublet model. An anomalous coupling of $\\tau$ to\nthe charged Higgs is introduced to fit the data from BaBar, Belle, and LHCb. It\nis shown that all of the four types of the model yield similar values of the\nminimum $\\chi^2$. Also shown is that the newly normalized $R(D^{(*)})$ with the\nbranching ratio of $B\\to\\tau\\nu$ decay exhibits much smaller minimum $\\chi^2$.\n", "  The purpose of this review is to discuss the advantages and problems of\nnear-infrared surveys in observing pulsating stars in the Milky Way. One of the\nadvantages of near-infrared surveys, when compared to optical counterparts, is\nthat the interstellar extinction is significantly smaller. As we see in this\nreview, a significant volume of the Galactic disk can be reached by infrared\nsurveys but not by optical ones. Towards highly obscured regions in the\nGalactic mid-plane, however, the interstellar extinction causes serious\nproblems even with near-infrared data in understanding the observational\nresults. After a review on previous and current near-infrared surveys, we\ndiscuss the effects of the interstellar extinction in optical (including {\\it\nGaia}) to near-infrared broad bands based on a simple calculation using\nsynthetic spectral energy distribution. We then review the recent results on\nclassical Cepheids towards the Galactic center and the bulge, as a case study,\nto see the impact of the uncertainty in the extinction law. The extinction law,\ni.e. the wavelength dependency of the extinction, is not fully characterized,\nand its uncertainty makes it hard to make the correction. Its characterization\nis an urgent task in order to exploit the outcomes of ongoing large-scale\nsurveys of pulsating stars, e.g. for drawing a map of pulsating stars across\nthe Galactic disk.\n", "  A free field representation of the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra of the\nSU(N)xSU(N) Principal Chiral Field model is constructed, and used to derive an\nintegral representation for form factors of a multi-parameter family of\nexponential fields.\n", "  Bound states, also called soliton molecules, can form as a result of the\ninteraction between individual solitons. This interaction is mediated through\nthe tails of each soliton that overlap with one another. When such soliton\ntails have spatial oscillations, locking or pinning between two solitons can\noccur at fixed distances related with the wavelength of these oscillations,\nthus forming a bound state. In this work, we study the formation and stability\nof various types of bound states in the Lugiato-Lefever equation by computing\ntheir interaction potential and by analyzing the properties of the oscillatory\ntails. Moreover, we study the effect of higher order dispersion and noise in\nthe pump intensity on the dynamics of bound states. In doing so, we reveal that\nperturbations to the Lugiato-Lefever equation that maintain reversibility, such\nas fourth order dispersion, lead to bound states that tend to separate from one\nanother in time when noise is added. This separation force is determined by the\nshape of the envelope of the interaction potential, as well as an additional\nBrownian ratchet effect. In systems with broken reversibility, such as third\norder dispersion, this ratchet effect continues to push solitons within a bound\nstate apart. However, the force generated by the envelope of the potential is\nnow such that it pushes the solitons towards each other, leading to a null net\ndrift of the solitons.\n", "  For over a decade now, physical and energy constraints have limited clock\nspeed improvements in commodity microprocessors. Instead, chipmakers have been\npushed into producing lower-power, multi-core processors such as GPGPU, ARM and\nIntel MIC. Broad-based efforts from manufacturers and developers have been\ndevoted to making these processors user-friendly enough to perform general\ncomputations. However, extracting performance from a larger number of cores, as\nwell as specialized vector or SIMD units, requires special care in algorithm\ndesign and code optimization. One of the most computationally challenging\nproblems in high-energy particle experiments is finding and fitting the\ncharged-particle tracks during event reconstruction. This is expected to become\nby far the dominant problem in the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider\n(HL-LHC), for example. Today the most common track finding methods are those\nbased on the Kalman filter. Experience with Kalman techniques on real tracking\ndetector systems has shown that they are robust and provide high physics\nperformance. This is why they are currently in use at the LHC, both in the\ntrigger and offline. Previously we reported on the significant parallel\nspeedups that resulted from our investigations to adapt Kalman filters to track\nfitting and track building on Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi. Here, we discuss our\nprogresses toward the understanding of these processors and the new\ndevelopments to port Kalman filter to NVIDIA GPUs.\n", "  We report a method for constructing bandpass functions that approximate a\ngiven analytic function with arbitrary accuracy over a finite interval. A\ncorollary is that bandpass functions can be obtained that oscillate arbitrarily\nslower than their minimum frequency component, a counter-intuitive phenomenon\nknown as suboscillations.\n", "  The Bayesian discovery probability of future experiments searching for\nneutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay is evaluated under the popular assumption\nthat neutrinos are their own antiparticles. A Bayesian global fit is performed\nto construct a probability distribution for the effective Majorana mass, the\nobservable of interest for these experiments. This probability distribution is\nthen combined with the sensitivity of each experiment derived from a heuristic\ncounting analysis. The discovery probability is found to be higher than\npreviously considered, but strongly depends on whether the neutrino mass\nordering is normal or inverted. For the inverted ordering, next-generation\nexperiments are likely to observe a signal already during their first\noperational stages. Even for the normal ordering, in the absence of neutrino\nmass mechanisms that drive the lightest state or the effective Majorana mass to\nzero, the probability of discovering neutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay can\nreach $\\sim$50% or more in the most promising experiments.\n", "  We construct novel RG flows of D=11 supergravity that asymptotically approach\n$AdS_4\\times S^7$ in the UV with deformations that break spatial translations\nin the dual field theory. In the IR the solutions return to exactly the same\n$AdS_4\\times S^7$ vacuum, with a renormalisation of relative length scales, and\nhence we refer to the flows as `boomerang RG flows'. For sufficiently large\ndeformations, on the way to the IR the solutions also approach two distinct\nintermediate scaling regimes, each with hyperscaling violation. The first\nregime is Lorentz invariant with dynamical exponent $z=1$ while the second has\n$z=5/2$. Neither of the two intermediate scaling regimes are associated with\nexact hyperscaling violation solutions of $D=11$ supergravity. The RG flow\nsolutions are constructed using the four dimensional $N=2$ STU gauged\nsupergravity theory with vanishing gauge fields, but non-vanishing scalar and\npseudoscalar fields. In the ABJM dual field theory the flows are driven by\nspatially modulated deformation parameters for scalar and fermion bilinear\noperators.\n", "  Considering Rashba quantum wires with a proximity-induced superconducting gap\nas physical realizations of Majorana fermions and quantum dots, we calculate\nthe overlap of the Majorana wave functions with the local wave functions on the\ndot. We determine the spin-dependent tunneling amplitudes between these two\nlocalized states and show that we can tune into a fully spin polarized\ntunneling regime by changing the distance between dot and Majorana fermion.\nUpon directly applying this to the tunneling model Hamiltonian, we calculate\nthe effective magnetic field on the quantum dot flanked by two Majorana\nfermions. The direction of the induced magnetic field on the dot depends on the\noccupation of the nonlocal fermion formed from the two Majorana end states\nwhich can be used as a readout for such a Majorana qubit.\n", "  We study a variant of Gauge-flation where the gauge symmetry is spontaneously\nbroken by a Higgs sector. We work in the Stueckelberg limit and demonstrate\nthat the dynamics remain (catastrophically) unstable for cases where the gauge\nfield masses satisfy $\\gamma < 2$, where $\\gamma = g^2\\psi^2/H^2$, $g$ is the\ngauge coupling, $\\psi$ is the gauge field vacuum expectation value, and $H$ is\nthe Hubble rate. We compute the spectrum of density fluctuations and\ngravitational waves, and show that the model can produce observationally viable\nspectra. The background gauge field texture violates parity, resulting in a\nchiral gravitational wave spectrum. This arises due to an exponential\nenhancement of one polarization of the spin-2 fluctuation of the gauge field.\nHiggsed Gauge-flation can produce observable gravitational waves at\ninflationary energy scales well below the GUT scale.\n", "  In this paper, we demonstrate the emergence of nonlinear gravitational\nequations directly from the physics of a broad class of conformal field\ntheories. We consider CFT excited states defined by adding sources for scalar\nprimary or stress tensor operators to the Euclidean path integral defining the\nvacuum state. For these states, we show that up to second order in the sources,\nthe entanglement entropy for all ball-shaped regions can always be represented\ngeometrically (via the Ryu-Takayanagi formula) by an asymptotically AdS\ngeometry. We show that such a geometry necessarily satisfies Einstein's\nequations perturbatively up to second order, with a stress energy tensor\narising from matter fields associated with the sourced primary operators. We\nmake no assumptions about AdS/CFT duality, so our work serves as both a\nconsistency check for the AdS/CFT correspondence and a direct demonstration\nthat spacetime and gravitational physics can emerge from the description of\nentanglement in conformal field theories.\n", "  This paper explores the dynamics of both neutral as well as charged particles\norbiting near a rotating black hole in scalar-tensor-vector gravity. We study\nthe conditions for the particle to escape at the innermost stable circular\norbit. We investigate stability of orbits through effective potential and\nLyapunov exponent in the presence of magnetic field. The effective force acting\non particle is also discussed. We also study the center of mass energy of\nparticle collision near the horizon of this black hole. Finally, we compare our\nresults with the particle motion around Schwarzschild, Kerr and\nSchwarzschild-MOG black holes. It is concluded that the external magnetic\nfield, spin parameter as well as dimensionless parameter of the theory have\nstrong effects on particle dynamics in modified gravity.\n", "  Results for particle production in root-s = 5.02 TeV p+Pb collisions at the\nLarge Hadron Collider within a combined classical Yang-Mills and relativistic\nviscous hydrodynamic calculation are presented. We emphasize the importance of\nsub-nucleon scale fluctuations in the proton projectile to describe the\nexperimentally observed azimuthal harmonic coefficients, demonstrating their\nsensitivity to the proton shape. We stress that the proton shape and its\nfluctuations are not free parameters in our calculations. Instead, they have\nbeen constrained using experimental data from HERA on exclusive vector meson\nproduction. Including temperature dependent shear and bulk viscosities, as well\nas UrQMD for the low temperature regime, we present results for mean transverse\nmomenta, harmonic flow coefficients for charged hadrons and identified\nparticles, as well as Hanbury-Brown-Twiss radii.\n", "  We compute the parity violating three point amplitudes with one scalar leg in\nhigher spin gravity and compare results with those of Chern-Simons matter\ntheories. The three-point correlators of the free boson, free fermion, critical\nvector model and Gross-Neveu model are reproduced including the dependence on\nthe Chern-Simons coupling. We also perform a simple test of the modified higher\nspin equations proposed in arXiv:1605.02662 [hep-th] and find that the results\nare consistent with the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n", "  A collision model (CM) is a framework to describe open quantum dynamics. In\nits {\\it memoryless} version, it models the reservoir $\\mathcal R$ as\nconsisting of a large collection of elementary ancillas: the dynamics of the\nopen system $\\mathcal{S}$ results from successive \"collisions\" of $\\mathcal{S}$\nwith the ancillas of $\\mathcal R$. Here, we present a general formulation of\nmemoryless {\\it composite} CMs, where $\\mathcal S$ is partitioned into the very\nopen system under study $S$ coupled to one or more auxiliary systems $\\{S_i\\}$.\nTheir composite dynamics occurs through internal $S$-$\\{S_i\\}$ collisions\ninterspersed with external ones involving $\\{S_i\\}$ and the reservoir $\\mathcal\nR$. We show that important known instances of quantum {\\it non-Markovian}\ndynamics of $S$ -- such as the emission of an atom into a reservoir featuring a\nLorentzian, or multi-Lorentzian, spectral density or a qubit subject to random\ntelegraph noise -- can be mapped on to such {\\it memoryless} composite CMs.\n", "  In spite of their intrinsic one-dimensional nature matrix product states have\nbeen systematically used to obtain remarkably accurate results for\ntwo-dimensional systems. Motivated by basic entropic arguments favoring\nprojected entangled-pair states as the method of choice, we assess the relative\nperformance of infinite matrix product states and infinite projected\nentangled-pair states on cylindrical geometries. By considering the Heisenberg\nand half-filled Hubbard models on the square lattice as our benchmark cases, we\nevaluate their variational energies as a function of both bond dimension as\nwell as cylinder width. In both examples we find crossovers at moderate\ncylinder widths, i.e. for the largest bond dimensions considered we find an\nimprovement on the variational energies for the Heisenberg model by using\nprojected entangled-pair states at a width of about 11 sites, whereas for the\nhalf-filled Hubbard model this crossover occurs at about 7 sites.\n", "  We present Iron, Magnesium, Calcium, and Titanium abundances for 235 stars in\nthe central region of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (within 9.0\narcmin ~70 pc from the center) from medium-resolution Keck/DEIMOS spectra. All\nthe considered stars belong to the massive globular cluster M54 or to the\ncentral nucleus of the galaxy (Sgr,N). In particular we provide abundances for\n109 stars with [Fe/H] > -1.0, more than doubling the available sample of\nspectroscopic metallicity and alpha-elements abundance estimates for Sgr dSph\nstars in this metallicity regime. Also, we find the first confirmed member of\nthe Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal with [Fe/H]< -2.0 based on analysis of iron\nlines. We find for the first time a metallicity gradient in the Sgr,N\npopulation, whose peak iron abundance goes from [Fe/H]=-0.38 for R < 2.5 arcmin\nto [Fe/H]=-0.57 for 5.0 < R < 9.0 arcmin. On the other hand the trends of\n[Mg/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ti/Fe] with [Fe/H] are the same over the entire region\nexplored by our study. We reproduce the observed chemical patterns of the\nSagittarius dwarf spheroidal as a whole with a chemical evolution model\nimplying a high mass progenitor ( M_(DM)=6 X 10^{10} Msun ) and a significant\nevent of mass-stripping occurred a few Gyr ago, presumably starting at the\nfirst peri-Galactic passage after infall.\n", "  We report a theoretical and simulation study of the drying and wetting phase\ntransitions of a truncated Lennard-Jones fluid at a flat structureless wall.\nBinding potential calculations predict that the nature of these transitions\ndepends on whether the wall-fluid attraction has a long ranged (LR) power law\ndecay, or is instead truncated, rendering it short ranged (SR). Using grand\ncanonical Monte Carlo simulation and classical density functional theory we\nexamine both cases in detail. We find that for the LR case wetting is first\norder, while drying is continuous (critical) and occurs exactly at zero\nattractive wall strength, ie. in the limit of a hard wall. In the SR case,\ndrying is also critical but the order of the wetting transition depends on the\ntruncation range of the wall-fluid potential. We characterize the approach to\ncritical drying and wetting in terms of the density and local compressibility\nprofiles and via the finite-size scaling properties of the probability\ndistribution of the overall density. For the LR case, where the drying point is\nknown exactly, this analysis allows us to estimate the exponent $\\nu_\\parallel$\nwhich controls the parallel correlation length, i.e. the extent of vapor\nbubbles at the wall. Surprisingly, the value we obtain is over twice that\npredicted by mean field and renormalization group calculations, despite the\nfact that our three dimensional system is at the upper critical dimension where\nmean field theory for critical exponents is expected to hold. We suggest\nreasons for this discrepancy.\n", "  We sketch a novel method to search for light di-leptonic resonances by\nexploiting precision measurements of Drell-Yan production. Motivated by the\nrecent hints of lepton flavour universality violation in $B \\to K^{\\ast} \\ell^+\n\\ell^-$, we illustrate our proposal by studying the case of spin-1 resonances\nthat couple to muons and have masses in the range of a few GeV. We show that\nthe existing LHC data on $pp \\to Z/\\gamma^\\ast \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ put non-trivial\nconstraints on light di-muon resonance interpretations of $B$ decay anomalies\nin a model-independent fashion. The impact of our proposal on the long-standing\ndiscrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is also briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this work, we analyze the excitonic gap generation in the strong-coupling\nregime of thin films of three-dimensional time-reversal-invariant topological\ninsulators. We start by writing down the effective gauge theory in\n2+1-dimensions from the projection of the 3+1-dimensional quantum\nelectrodynamics. Within this method, we obtain a short-range interaction, which\nhas the form of a Thirring-like term, and a long-range one. The interaction\nbetween the two surface states of the material induces an excitonic gap. By\nusing the large-$N$ approximation in the strong-coupling limit, we find that\nthere is a dynamical mass generation for the excitonic states that preserves\ntime-reversal symmetry and is related to the dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking\nof our model. This symmetry breaking occurs only for values of the\nfermion-flavor number smaller than $N_{c}\\approx 11.8$. Our results show that\nthe inclusion of the full dynamical interaction strongly modifies the critical\nnumber of flavors for the occurrence of exciton condensation, and therefore,\ncannot be neglected.\n", "  We argue that the level-$1$ elliptic algebra\n$U_{q,p}(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{g}})$ is a dynamical symmetry realized as a part of\n2d/5d correspondence where the Drinfeld currents are the screening currents to\nthe $q$-Virasoro/W block in the 2d side. For the case of\n$U_{q,p}(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}(2))$, the level-$1$ module has a realization\nby an elliptic version of the Frenkel-Kac construction. The module admits the\naction of the deformed Virasoro algebra. In a $r$-th root of unity limit of $p$\nwith $q^2 \\rightarrow 1$, the $\\mathbb{Z}_r$-parafermions and a free boson\nappear and the value of the central charge that we obtain agrees with that of\nthe 2d coset CFT with para-Virasoro symmetry, which corresponds to the 4d\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory on $\\mathbb{R}^4/\\mathbb{Z}_r$.\n", "  We study impact of inertia on directed transport of a Brownian particle under\nnon-equilibrium conditions: the particle moves in a one-dimensional periodic\nand symmetric potential, is driven by both an unbiased time-periodic force and\na constant force, and is coupled to a thermostat of temperature T. Within\nselected parameter regimes this system exhibits negative mobility, which means\nthat the particle moves in the direction opposite to the direction of the\nconstant force. It is known that in such a setup the inertial term is essential\nfor the emergence of negative mobility and it cannot be detected in the\nlimiting case of overdamped dynamics. We analyse inertial effects and show that\nnegative mobility can be observed even in the strong damping regime. We\ndetermine the optimal dimensionless mass for the presence of negative mobility\nand reveal three mechanisms standing behind this anomaly: deterministic\nchaotic, thermal noise induced and deterministic non-chaotic. The last origin\nhas never been reported. It may provide guidance to the possibility of\nobservation of negative mobility for strongly damped dynamics which is of\nfundamental importance from the point of view of biological systems, all of\nwhich in situ operate in fluctuating environments.\n", "  The Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) is one of the payloads in ASTROSAT,\nthe first Indian Space Observatory. The UVIT instrument has two 375mm\ntelescopes: one for the far-ultraviolet (FUV) channel (1300--1800\\AA), and the\nother for the near-ultraviolet (NUV) channel (2000--3000\\AA) and the visible\n(VIS) channel (3200--5500\\AA). UVIT is primarily designed for simultaneous\nimaging in the two ultraviolet channels with spatial resolution better than 1.8\narcsec, along with provision for slit-less spectroscopy in the NUV and FUV\nchannels.The results of in-orbit calibrations of UVIT are presented in this\npaper.\n", "  An analytical expression for the energy of N\\'eel skyrmions in ultra-thin\nnanodots considering exchange, uniaxial anisotropy, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and\ndipolar contributions has been obtained. In particular, we have proposed for\nthe N\\'eel skyrmion, a general ansatz for the component of the magnetization\nperpendicular to the dot, given by $m_z(r) = [1-(r/R_s)^n]/[1 + (r/R_s)^n]$,\nwhere $R_s$ is the radius of the skyrmion and $n$ is an integer and even\nnumber. As proof of concept, we calculate the energy of a N\\'eel skyrmion in an\nultra-thin Co/Pt dot, and we find that the dipolar contribution cannot be\nneglected and that both Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and anisotropy play\nan important role to stabilize the skyrmion. Additionally, we have obtained a\ngood agreement between our analytical calculations and previously published\nmicromagnetic simulations for $n = 10$. For this reliable value of $n$, we have\nobtained that for a Dzyaloshinski Moriya constant $D = 5.5 \\, (mJ/m^2)$, it is\npossible to stabilize a N\\'eel skyrmion for $K_u$ in the range, $0.4 \\,\n(MJ/m^3)< K_u <1.3 \\, (MJ/m^3)$, whereas for $K_u = 0.8 \\, (MJ/m^3)$, the\nskyrmion stabilizes for $5.0 \\, (mJ/m^2) < D <6.0 \\, (mJ/m^2) $. Thus, this\nanalytical equation can be widely used to predict stability ranges for the\nN\\'eel skyrmion in spintronic devices.\n", "  By analyzing a paradigmatic example of the theory of dissipative systems --\nthe classical and quantum dissipative standard map -- we are able to explain\nthe main features of the decay to the quantum equilibrium state. The classical\nisoperiodic stable structures typically present in the parameter space of these\nkind of systems play a fundamental role. In fact, we have found that the period\nof stable structures that are near in this space determines the phase of the\nleading eigenstates of the corresponding quantum superoperator. Moreover, the\neigenvectors show a strong localization on the corresponding periodic orbits\n(limit cycles). We show that this sort of scarring phenomenon (an established\nproperty of Hamiltonian and projectively open systems) is present in the\ndissipative case and it is of extreme simplicity.\n", "  Polarization-induced renormalization of the frontier energy levels of\ninteracting molecules and surfaces can cause significant shifts in the\nexcitation and transport behavior of electrons. This phenomenon is crucial in\ndetermining the oxidative stability of nonaqeous electrolytes in high energy\ndensity electrochemical systems such as the Li-O$_2$ battery. On the basis of\npartially self-consistent first-principles ScGW0 calculations, we\nsystematically study how the electronic energy levels of four commonly used\nsolvent molecules, namely dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethoxyethane (DME),\ntetrahydrofuran (THF) and acetonitrile (ACN), renormalize when physisorbed on\nthe different stable surfaces of Li$_2$O$_2$, the main discharge product. Using\nband level alignment arguments, we propose that the difference between the\nsolvent's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and the surface's\nvalence band maximum (VBM) is a refined metric of oxidative stability. This\nmetric and a previously used descriptor, solvent's gas phase HOMO level, agree\nquite well for physisorbed cases on pristine surfaces where ACN is oxidatively\nmost stable followed by DME, THF and DMSO. However, this effect is\nintrinsically linked to the surface chemistry of solvent's interaction with the\nsurfaces states and defects, and depends strongly on their nature. We\nconclusively show that the propensity of solvent molecules to oxidize will be\nsignificantly higher on Li$_2$O$_2$ surfaces with defects as compared to\npristine surfaces. This suggests that the oxidatively stability of solvent is\ndynamic and is a strong function of surface electronic properties. Thus, while\ngas phase HOMO levels could be used for preliminary solvent candidate\nscreening, a more refined picture of solvent stability requires mapping out the\nsolvent stability as a function of the state of the surface under the operating\nconditions.\n", "  We calculate the leading contributions to the connected two-point functions\nof protected scalar operators in the defect version of N=4 SYM theory which is\ndual to the D5-D3 probe-brane system with k units of background gauge field\nflux. This involves several types of two-point functions which are vanishing in\nthe theory without the defect, such as two-point functions of operators of\nunequal conformal dimension. We furthermore exploit the operator product\nexpansion (OPE) and the boundary operator expansion (BOE), which form the basis\nof the boundary conformal bootstrap equations, to extract conformal data both\nabout the defect CFT and about N=4 SYM theory without the defect. From the\nknowledge of the one- and two-point functions of the defect theory, we extract\ncertain structure constants of N=4 SYM theory using the (bulk) OPE and\nconstrain certain bulk-bulk-to-boundary couplings using the BOE. The extraction\nof the former relies on a non-trivial, polynomial k dependence of the one-point\nfunctions, which we explicitly demonstrate. In addition, it requires the\nknowledge of the one-point functions of SU$(2)$ descendant operators, which we\nlikewise explicitly determine.\n", "  Context: The origin of GRBs' prompt emission is highly debated. Proposed\nscenarios involve dissipation processes above or below the photosphere of an\nultra-relativistic outflow. Aims: We search for observational features that\nwould favour one scenario over the others by constraining the dissipation\nradius, the outflow magnetization or by indicating the presence of shocks.\nBursts showing peculiarities can emphasize the role of a specific physical\ningredient, which becomes more apparent under certain circumstances. Methods:\nWe study GRB 070110, which exhibited several remarkable features during its\nearly afterglow: a very flat plateau terminated by an extremely steep drop and\nimmediately followed by a bump. We model the plateau as photospheric emission\nfrom a long lasting outflow of moderate Lorentz factor ($\\Gamma\\sim 20$) which\nlags behind an ultra-relativistic ($\\Gamma> 100$) ejecta responsible for the\nprompt emission. We compute the dissipation of energy in the forward and\nreverse shocks resulting from this ejecta's deceleration by the external\nmedium. Results: Photospheric emission from the long-lasting outflow can\naccount for the plateau properties (luminosity and spectrum) assuming some\ndissipation takes place in the flow. The geometrical timescale at the\nphotospheric radius is so short that the observed decline at the end of the\nplateau likely corresponds to the shut-down of the central engine. The\nfollowing bump results from dissipated power in the reverse shock, which\ndevelops when the slower material catches up with the initially fast component,\nafter it had been decelerated. Conclusions: Our interpretation suggests that\nthe prompt phase resulted from dissipation above the photosphere while the\nplateau had a photospheric origin. If the bump is produced by the reverse\nshock, it implies an upper limit ($\\sigma \\lesssim 0.1$) on the magnetization\nof the slower material.\n", "  Erratum to the article: Charge transfer to solvent identified using dark\nchannel fluorescence-yield L-edge spectroscopy, NATURE CHEMISTRY 2 (2010) 853\n", "  The Hori-Tong and Hori dualities are infrared dualities between\ntwo-dimensional gauge theories with $\\mathcal{N}{=}(2,2)$ supersymmetry, which\nare reminiscent of four-dimensional Seiberg dualities. We provide additional\nevidence for those dualities with $U(N_c)$, $USp(2N_c)$, $SO(N)$ and $O(N)$\ngauge groups, by matching correlation functions of Coulomb branch operators on\na Riemann surface $\\Sigma_g$, in the presence of the topological $A$-twist. The\n$O(N)$ theories studied, denoted by $O_+ (N)$ and $O_- (N)$, can be understood\nas $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifolds of an $SO(N)$ theory. The correlators of these\ntheories on $\\Sigma_g$ with $g > 0$ are obtained by computing correlators with\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-twisted boundary conditions and summing them up with weights\ndetermined by the orbifold projection.\n", "  Background has played an important role in X-ray missions, limiting the\nexploitation of science data in several and sometimes unexpected ways. In this\npresentation I review past X-ray missions focusing on some important lessons we\ncan learn from them. I then go on discussing prospects for overcoming\nbackground related limitations in future ones.\n", "  Differential ghost imaging was attempted in time domain, i.e., temporal\ndifferential ghost imaging (TDGI), using pseudo-randomized light pulses and a\ntemporal object consisting of no-return-to-zero bit patterns of varying duty.\nEvaluation of the signal-to-noise characteristics by taking account of errors\ndue to false cross-correlation between the reference and the bucket detector\nreadings indicates that the TDGI outperforms its non-differential counterpart,\ni.e., time-domain GI, in terms of consistently high and even duty-independent\nsignal-to-noise ratios that are achieved. Dynamic local averaging helps save\ndata recording without compromising the essential features of the TDGI.\n", "  We propose a generalisation of the Weak Gravity Conjecture in the presence of\nscalar fields. The proposal is guided by properties of extremal black holes in\n${\\cal N}=2$ supergravity, but can be understood more generally in terms of\nforbidding towers of stable gravitationally bound states. It amounts to the\nstatement that there must exist a particle on which the gauge force acts more\nstrongly than gravity and the scalar forces combined. We also propose that the\nscalar force itself should act on this particle stronger than gravity. This\nimplies that generically the mass of this particle decreases exponentially as a\nfunction of the scalar field expectation value for super-Planckian variations,\nwhich is behaviour predicted by the Refined Swampland Conjecture. In the\ncontext of ${\\cal N}=2$ supergravity the Weak Gravity Conjecture bound can be\ntied to bounds on scalar field distances in field space. Guided by this, we\npresent a general proof that for any linear combination of moduli in any\nCalabi-Yau compactification of string theory the proper field distance grows at\nbest logarithmically with the moduli values for super-Planckian distances.\n", "  We study two-dimensional Einstein-aether (or equivalently\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz) gravity, which has an $AdS_2$ solution. We examine various\nproperties of this solution in the context of holography. We first show that\nthe asymptotic symmetry group is the full set of time reparametrizations, the\none-dimensional conformal group. At the same time there are configurations with\nfinite energy and temperature, which indicate a violation of the Ward identity\nassociated with one-dimensional conformal invariance. These solutions are\ncharacterized by a universal causal horizon and we show that the associated\nentropy of the universal horizon scales with the logarithm of the temperature.\nWe discuss the puzzles associated with this result and argue that the violation\nof the Ward identity is associated with a type of explicit breaking of time\nreparametrizations in the hypothetical $0+1$ dimensional dual system.\n", "  We introduce a lattice gas implementation that is based on coarse-graining a\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Such a lattice gas is similar to standard\nlattice gases, but its collision operator is informed by an underlying MD\nsimulation. This can be considered an optimal lattice gas implementation\nbecause it allows for the representation of any system that can be simulated\nwith MD. We show here that equilibrium behavior of the popular lattice\nBoltzmann algorithm is consistent with this optimal lattice gas. This\ncomparison allows us to make a more accurate identification of the expressions\nfor temperature and pressure in lattice Boltzmann simulations which turn out to\nbe related not only to the physical temperature and pressure but also to the\nlattice discretization. We show that for any spatial discretization we need to\nchoose a particular temporal discretization to recover the lattice Boltzmann\nequilibrium.\n", "  In this note we deduce a new lower bound for the convergence radius of the\nVirial series of a continuous system of classical particles interacting via a\nstable and tempered pair potential using the estimates on the Mayer\ncoefficients obtained in the recent paper by Procacci and Yuhjtman (Lett Math\nPhys 107:31-46, 2017). This corrects the wrongly optimistic lower bound for the\nsame radius claimed (but not proved) in the above cited paper (in Remark 2\nbelow Theorem 1). The lower bound for the convergence radius of the Virial\nseries provided here represents a strong improvement on the classical estimate\ngiven by Lebowitz and Penrose in 1964.\n", "  We use the slave-spin mean-field approach to study particle-hole symmetric\none- and two-band Hubbard models in presence of Hund's coupling interaction. By\nanalytical analysis of Hamiltonian, we show that the locking of the two\norbitals vs.\\,orbital-selective Mott transition can be formulated within a\nLandau-Ginzburg framework. By applying the slave-spin mean-field to impurity\nproblem, we are able to make a correspondence between impurity and lattice. We\nalso consider the stability of the orbital selective Mott phase to the\nhybridization between the orbitals and study the limitations of the slave-spin\nmethod for treating inter-orbital tunnellings in the case of multi-orbital\nBethe lattices with particle-hole symmetry.\n", "  We consider several diffeomorphism invariant field theories of 2- and 3-forms\nin six dimensions. They all share the same kinetic term $BdC$, but differ in\nthe potential term that is added. The theory $BdC$ with no potential term is\ntopological - it describes no propagating degrees of freedom. We show that the\ntheory continues to remain topological when either the $BBB$ or $C\\hat{C}$\npotential term is added. The latter theory can be viewed as a background\nindependent version of the 6-dimensional Hitchin theory, for its critical\npoints are complex or para-complex 6-manifolds, but unlike in Hitchin's\nconstruction, one does not need to choose of a background cohomology class to\ndefine the theory. We also show that the dimensional reduction of the\n$C\\hat{C}$ theory to three dimensions, when reducing on S3, gives 3D gravity.\n", "  The growth and characterization of CePtIn4, stabilized by 10% Zn substitution\nfor In, is reported. The new material is orthorhombic, space group Cmcm (No.\n63), with lattice parameters a = 4.51751(4) {\\AA}, b = 16.7570(2) {\\AA}, and c\n= 7.36682(8) {\\AA}, and the refined crystal composition has 10% of Zn\nsubstituted for In, i.e. the crystals are CePt(In3.6Zn0.1)4. Crystals were\ngrown using a self-flux method: only growths containing Zn yielded CePtIn4\ncrystals, while Ce3Pt4In13 crystals formed when Zn was not present. Anisotropic\ntemperature-dependent magnetic susceptibilities for single crystals show that\nZn-stabilized CePtIn4 orders magnetically at ~1.9 K. High-temperature\nCurie-Weiss fits indicate an effective moment of ~2.30 muB/ Ce and a\ndirectionally averaged Weiss-temperature of approximately - 9 K. Specific heat\ndata shows a peak consistent with the ordering temperature seen in the magnetic\nsusceptibility data. Zn-stabilized CePtIn4 is metallic and displays no\nsuperconducting transition down to 0.14 K.\n", "  Two oscillators coupled to a two-level system which in turn is coupled to an\ninfinite number of oscillators (reservoir) are considered, bringing to light\nthe occurrence of synchronization. A detailed analysis clarifies the physical\nmechanism that forces the system to oscillate at a single frequency with a\npredictable and tunable phase difference. Finally, the scheme is generalized to\nthe case of $N$ oscillators and $M(<N)$ two-level systems.\n", "  We construct supersymmetric AdS_3 solutions in F-theory, that is Type IIB\nsupergravity with varying axio-dilaton, which are holographically dual to 2d\nN=(0,4) superconformal field theories with small superconformal algebra. In\nF-theory these arise from D3-branes wrapped on curves in the base of an\nelliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefold Y_3 and correspond to strings in the\n6d N=(1,0) theory obtained from F-theory on Y_3. The non-trivial fibration over\nthe wrapped curves implies a varying coupling of the N=4 Super-Yang-Mills\ntheory on the D3-branes. We compute the holographic central charges and show\nthat these agree with the field theory and with the anomalies of self-dual\nstrings in 6d. We complement our analysis with a discussion of the dual\nM-theory solutions and a comparison of the central charges.\n", "  We study if the minimal sneutrino chaotic inflation is consistent with a\nflavor symmetry of the Froggatt-Nielsen type, to derive testable predictions on\nthe Dirac and Majorana CP violating phases, $\\delta$ and $\\alpha$. For\nsuccessful inflation, the two right-handed neutrinos, i.e., the inflaton and\nstabilizer fields, must be degenerate in mass. First we find that the lepton\nflavor symmetry structure becomes less manifest in the light neutrino masses in\nthe seesaw mechanism, and this tendency becomes most prominent when\nright-handed neutrinos are degenerate. Secondly, the Dirac CP phase turns out\nto be sensitive to whether the shift symmetry breaking depends on the lepton\nflavor symmetry. When the flavor symmetry is imposed only on the stabilizer\nYukawa couplings, distributions of the CP phases are peaked at $\\delta \\simeq\n\\pm \\pi/4, \\pm 3\\pi/4$ and $\\alpha = 0$, while the vanishing and maximal Dirac\nCP phases are disfavored. On the other hand, when the flavor symmetry is\nimposed on both the inflaton and stabilizer Yukawa couplings, it is rather\ndifficult to explain the observed neutrino data, and those parameters\nconsistent with the observation prefer the vanishing CP phases $\\delta = 0,\n\\pi$ and $\\alpha = 0$.\n", "  By submonolayer insertion of Au, Pt, or Pd into Ta / CoFeB / MgO / Ta\nheterostructures we tune the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and the coercive\nfield of the ferromagnetic layer. We demonstrate that this has a major\ninfluence on the spin Hall switching current density and its dependence on the\nexternal magnetic field. Despite a rather small effective spin Hall angle of\n$\\theta_\\mathrm{SH} \\approx -0.07$, we obtain switching current densities as\nlow as $2 \\times 10^{10}$ A/m$^2$ with a 2 \\AA{} Au interlayer. We find that\nthe Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction parameter $D$ is reduced with Au or Pd\ninterlayers, and the perpendicular anisotropy field is reduced by an order of\nmagnitude with the Pd interlayer. The dependence of the switching current\ndensity on the current pulse width is quantitatively explained with a domain\nwall nucleation and propagation model. Interface engineering is thus found to\nbe a suitable route to tailor the current-induced magnetization switching\nproperties of magnetic heterostructures.\n", "  We present a scheme for achieving thermal bistability based on the selective\ncoupling of three optical resonances. This approach requires one of the\nresonant frequencies to be temperature dependent, which can occur in materials\nexhibiting strong thermo-optic effects. For illustration, we explore thermal\nbistability in two different passive systems, involving either a periodic array\nof Si ring resonators or parallel GaAs thin films separated by vacuum and\nexchanging heat in the near field. Such a scheme could prove useful for thermal\nmemory devices operating with transition times $\\lesssim$ hundreds of\nmilliseconds.\n", "  Lorentzian continuation of the Sine-Liouville model describes non-homogeneous\nrolling closed string tachyon. Via T-duality, this relates to the gauged\n$H_+^3$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model at subcritical level. This model is exactly\nsolvable. We give a closed formula for the 3-point correlation functions for\nthe model at level k within the range 0<k<2, which relates to the analogous\nquantity for k>2 in a similar way as how the Harlow-Maltz-Witten 3-point\nfunction of timelike Liouville field theory relates to the analytic\ncontinuation of the Dorn-Otto-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov structure constants:\nWe find that the ratio between both 3-point functions can be written in terms\nof the Jacobi's $\\theta $-function, while their product exhibits remarkable\ncancellations and eventually factorizes. Our formula is consistent with\nprevious proposals made in the literature.\n", "  In the previous report [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf{62}} 13812 (2000)], by proposing\nthe mechanism under which electric conductivity is caused by the activational\nhopping conduction with the Wigner surmise of the level statistics, the\ntemperature-dependent of electronic conductivity of a highly disordered carbon\nsystem was evaluated including apparent metal-insulator transition. Since the\nsystem consists of small pieces of graphite, it was assumed that the reason why\nthe level statistics appears is due to the behavior of the quantum chaos in\neach granular graphite. In this article, we revise the assumption and show\nanother origin of the Wigner surmise, which is more natural for the carbon\nsystem based on a recent investigation of graph zeta function in graph theory.\n", "  Experiments show that at 298~K and 1 atm pressure the transfer free energy,\n$\\mu^{\\rm ex}$, of water from its vapor to liquid normal alkanes $C_nH_{2n+2}$\n($n=5\\ldots12$) is negative. Earlier it was found that with the united-atom\nTraPPe model for alkanes and the SPC/E model for water, one had to artificially\nenhance the attractive alkane-water cross interaction to capture this behavior.\nHere we revisit the calculation of $\\mu^{\\rm ex}$ using the polarizable AMOEBA\nand the non-polarizable Charmm General (CGenFF) forcefields. We test both the\nAMOEBA03 and AMOEBA14 water models; the former has been validated with the\nAMOEBA alkane model while the latter is a revision of AMOEBA03 to better\ndescribe liquid water. We calculate $\\mu^{\\rm ex}$ using the test particle\nmethod. With CGenFF, $\\mu^{\\rm ex}$ is positive and the error relative to\nexperiments is about 1.5 $k_{\\rm B}T$. With AMOEBA, $\\mu^{\\rm ex}$ is negative\nand deviations relative to experiments are between 0.25 $k_{\\rm B}T$ (AMOEBA14)\nand 0.5 $k_{\\rm B}T$ (AMOEBA03). Quantum chemical calculations in a continuum\nsolvent suggest that zero point effects may account for some of the deviation.\nForcefield limitations notwithstanding, electrostatic and induction effects,\ncommonly ignored in considerations of water-alkane interactions, appear to be\ndecisive in the solubility of water in alkanes.\n", "  We propose several Two Higgs Doublet Models with the addition of an Abelian\ngauge group which free the usual framework from flavor changing neutral\ninteractions and explain neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism. We\ndiscuss the kinetic and mass-mixing gripping phenomenology which encompass\nseveral constraints coming from atomic parity violation, the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment, rare meson decays, Higgs physics, LEP precision data,\nneutrino-electron scattering, low energy accelerators and LHC probes.\n", "  Building on [1], we examine a holographic model in which a U(1) symmetry and\ntranslational invariance are broken spontaneously at the same time. The\nsymmetry breaking is realized through the St\\\"{u}ckelberg mechanism, and leads\nto a scalar condensate and a charge density which are spatially modulated and\nexhibit unidirectional stripe order. Depending on the choice of parameters, the\noscillations of the scalar condensate can average out to zero, with a frequency\nwhich is half of that of the charge density. In this case the system realizes\nsome of the key features of pair density wave order. The model also admits a\nphase with co-existing superconducting and charge density wave orders, in which\nthe scalar condensate has a uniform component. In our construction the various\norders are intertwined with each other and have a common origin. The fully\nbackreacted geometry is computed numerically, including for the case in which\nthe theory contains axions. The latter can be added to explicitly break\ntranslational symmetry and mimic lattice-type effects.\n", "  Using forward models for representative exoplanet atmospheres and a\nradiometric instrument model, we have generated synthetic observational data to\nexplore how well the major C- and O-bearing chemical species (CO, CO2, CH4, and\nH2O), important for determining atmospheric opacity and radiation balance, can\nbe constrained by transit measurements as a function of spectral wavelength\ncoverage. This work features simulations for a notional transit spectroscopy\nmission and compares two cases for instrument spectral coverage (wavelength\ncoverage from 0.5-2.5 ${\\mu}$m and 0.5-5 ${\\mu}$m. The simulation is conducted\non a grid with a range of stellar magnitudes and incorporates a full retrieval\nof atmospheric model parameters. We consider a range of planets from\nsub-Neptunes to hot Jupiters and include both low and high mean molecular\nweight atmospheres. We find that including the 2.5-5 ${\\mu}$m wavelength range\nprovides a significant improvement in the degree of constraint on the retrieved\nmolecular abundances: up to ~3 orders of magnitude for a low mean molecular\nweight atmosphere (${\\mu}$=2.3) and up to a factor of ~6 for a high mean\nmolecular weight atmosphere (${\\mu}$=28). These decreased uncertainties imply\nthat broad spectral coverage between the visible and the mid-infrared is an\nimportant tool for understanding the chemistry and composition of exoplanet\natmospheres. This analysis suggests that the JWST/NIRSpec 0.6-5 ${\\mu}$m prism\nspectroscopy mode, or similar wavelength coverage with possible future\nmissions, will be an important resource for exoplanet atmospheric\ncharacterization.\n", "  We give a separability criterion for three qubit states in terms of diagonal\nand anti-diagonal entries. This gives us a complete characterization of\nseparability when all the entries are zero except for diagonal and\nanti-diagonals. The criterion is expressed in terms of a norm arising from\nanti-diagonal entries. We compute this norm in several cases, so that we get\ncriteria with which we can decide the separability by routine computations.\n", "  Bare and surface-passivated Fe2N, Co2N, and Ni2N MXene were investigated by\nusing density functional theory. Fe2N(OH)2, Fe2NO2, Co2NO2, Ni2NF2, Ni2N(OH)2,\nand Ni2NO2 are intrinsic half-metals, while other structures have\nantiferromagnetic ground states. The half-metallicity of Ni2NT2 (T = F, OH, and\nO) does not depend on the type of surface terminations and should be more\nrealizable in experiments. The energy differences between the ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic configurations of Ni2NT2 are several hundreds of meV per\nprimitive cell. The Curie temperature should be above room temperature from the\npoint of view of mean field approximation.\n", "  We performed a Raman scattering study of thin films of LiTi$_2$O$_4$ spinel\noxide superconductor. We detected four out of five Raman active modes, with\nfrequencies in good accordance with our first-principles calculations. Three\nT$_{2g}$ modes show a Fano lineshape from 5 K to 295 K, which suggests an\nelectron-phonon coupling in LiTi$_2$O$_4$. Interestingly, the electron-phonon\ncoupling shows an anomaly across the negative to positive magnetoresistance\ntransition at 50 K, which may be due to the unset of other competing orders.\nThe strength of the electron-phonon interaction estimated from the Allen's\nformula and the observed lineshape parameters suggests that the three T$_{2g}$\nmodes contribute little to superconductivity.\n", "  Photo-transmutation of long-lived nuclear waste induced by high-charge\nrelativistic electron beam (e-beam) from laser plasma accelerator is\ndemonstrated. Collimated relativistic e-beam with a high charge of\napproximately 100 nC is produced from high-intensity laser interaction with\nnear-critical-density (NCD) plasma. Such e-beam impinges on a high-Z convertor\nand then radiates energetic bremsstrahlung photons with flux approaching\n10^{11} per laser shot. Taking long-lived radionuclide ^{126}Sn as an example,\nthe resulting transmutation reaction yield is the order of 10^{9} per laser\nshot, which is two orders of magnitude higher than obtained from previous\nstudies. It is found that at lower densities, tightly focused laser irradiating\nrelatively longer NCD plasmas can effectively enhance the transmutation\nefficiency. Furthermore, the photo-transmutation is generalized by considering\nmixed-nuclide waste samples, which suggests that the laser-accelerated\nhigh-charge e-beam could be an efficient tool to transmute long-lived nuclear\nwaste.\n", "  We report and analyse FIR observations of two Herbig Be stars, R Mon and PDS\n27, obtained with Herschel's instruments PACS and SPIRE. We construct SEDs and\nderive the infrared excess. We extract line fluxes from the PACS and SPIRE\nspectra and construct rotational diagrams in order to estimate the excitation\ntemperature of the gas. We derive CO, [OI] and [CI] luminosities to determine\nphysical conditions of the gas, as well as the dominant cooling mechanism. We\nconfirm that the Herbig Be stars are surrounded by remnants from their parental\nclouds, with an IR excess that mainly originates in a disc. In R Mon we detect\n[OI], [CI], [CII], CO (26 transitions), water and OH, while in PDS 27 we only\ndetect [CI] and CO (8 transitions). We attribute the absence of OH and water in\nPDS 27 to UV photo-dissociation and photo-evaporation. From the rotational\ndiagrams, we find several components for CO: we derive $T_{rot}$ 949$\\pm$90 K,\n358$\\pm$20 K & 77$\\pm$12 K for R Mon, 96$\\pm$12 K & 31$\\pm$4 K for PDS 27 and\n25$\\pm$8 K & 27$\\pm$6 K for their respective compact neighbours. The forsterite\nfeature at 69$\\mu$m was not detected in either of the sources, probably due to\nthe lack of (warm) crystalline dust in a flat disc. We find that cooling by\nmolecules is dominant in the Herbig Be stars, while this is not the case in\nHerbig Ae stars where cooling by [OI] dominates. Moreover, we show that in the\nHerbig Be star R Mon, outflow shocks are the dominant gas heating mechanism,\nwhile in Herbig Ae stars this is stellar. The outflow of R Mon contributes to\nthe observed line emission by heating the gas, both in the central spaxel/beam\ncovering the disc and the immediate surroundings, as well as in those\nspaxels/beams covering the parabolic shell around it. PDS 27, a B2 star, has\ndispersed a large part of its gas content and/or destroyed molecules; this is\nlikely given its intense UV field.\n", "  We consider rare semileptonic decays of a heavy $D$-meson into a light vector\nmeson in the framework of QCD factorization. In contrast to the corresponding\n$B$-meson decays, the naive factorization hypothesis does not even serve as a\nfirst approximation. Rather, the decay amplitudes appear to be dominated by\nnon-factorizable dynamics, e.g. through annihilation topologies, which are\nparticularly sensitive to long-distance hadronic contributions. We therefore\npay particular attention to intermediate vector-meson resonances appearing in\nquark-loop and annihilation topologies. Compared to the analogous $B$-meson\ndecays, we identify a number of effects that result in very large theoretical\nuncertainties for differential decay rates. Some of these effects are found to\ncancel in the ratio of partially integrated decay rates for transversely and\nlongitudinally polarized $\\rho$ mesons. On the phenomenological side this\nimplies a very limited potential to constrain physics beyond the Standard Model\nby means of these decays.\n", "  The non-Markovianity of the electron transfer in an oligothiophene-fullerene\nheterojunction described by a spin-boson model is analyzed using the time\ndependent decoherence canonical rates and the volume of accessible states in\nthe Bloch sphere. The dynamical map of the reduced electronic system is\ncomputed by the hierarchical equations of motion methodology (HEOM) providing\nan exact dynamics. Transitory witness of non-Markovianity is linked to the bath\ndynamics analyzed from the HEOM auxiliary matrices. The signature of the\ncollective bath mode detected from HEOM in each electronic state is compared\nwith predictions of the effective mode extracted from the spectral density. We\nshow that including this main reaction coordinate in a one-dimensional vibronic\nsystem coupled to a residual bath satisfactorily describes the electron\ntransfer by a simple Markovian Redfield equation. Non-Markovianity is computed\nfor three inter fragment distances and compared with a priori criterion based\non the system and bath characteristic timescales.\n", "  The minimum feedback arc set problem asks to delete a minimum number of arcs\n(directed edges) from a digraph (directed graph) to make it free of any\ndirected cycles. In this work we approach this fundamental cycle-constrained\noptimization problem by considering a generalized task of dividing the digraph\ninto D layers of equal size. We solve the D-segmentation problem by the\nreplica-symmetric mean field theory and belief-propagation heuristic\nalgorithms. The minimum feedback arc density of a given random digraph ensemble\nis then obtained by extrapolating the theoretical results to the limit of large\nD. A divide-and-conquer algorithm (nested-BPR) is devised to solve the minimum\nfeedback arc set problem with very good performance and high efficiency.\n", "  In this paper fundamental Wigner coefficients are determined algebraically by\nconsidering the eigenvalues of certain generalized Casimir invariants. Here\nthis method is applied in the context of both type 1 and type 2 unitary\nrepresentations of the Lie superalgebra gl(mjn). Extensions to the non-unitary\ncase are investigated. A symmetry relation between two classes of Wigner\ncoefficients is given in terms of a ratio of dimensions.\n", "  We construct the Lagrangian formulation of massive higher spin on-shell (1,0)\nsupermultiplets in three dimensional anti-de Sitter space. The construction is\nbased on description of the massive three dimensional fields in terms of\nframe-like gauge invariant formalism and technique of gauge invariant\ncurvatures. For the two possible massive supermultiplets (s,s+1/2) and\n(s,s-1/2) we derive explicit form of the supertransformations leaving the sum\nof bosonic and fermionic Lagrangians invariant.\n", "  An accurate description of the nonequilibrium dynamics of systems with\ncoupled spin and bosonic degrees of freedom remains theoretically challenging,\nespecially for large system sizes and in higher than one dimension. Phase space\nmethods such as the Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) have the advantage of\nbeing easily scalable and applicable to arbitrary dimensions. In this work we\nadapt the TWA to generic spin-boson models by making use of recently developed\nalgorithms for discrete phase spaces [Schachenmayer, PRX 5, 011022 (2015)].\nFurthermore we go beyond the standard TWA approximation by applying a scheme\nbased on the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy of equations\n[Pucci, PRB 93, 174302 (2016)] to our coupled spin-boson model. This allows in\nprinciple to study how systematically adding higher order corrections improves\nthe convergence of the method. To test various levels of approximation we study\nan exactly solvable spin-boson model which is particularly relevant for\ntrapped-ion arrays. Using TWA and its BBGKY extension we accurately reproduce\nthe time evolution of a number of one- and two-point correlation functions in\nseveral dimensions and for arbitrary number of bosonic modes.\n", "  Context: High-mass stars have a high degree of multiplicity and most likely\nform via disk accretion processes. The detailed physics of the binary and disk\nformation are still poorly constrained. Methods: Using the VLA in its most\nextended configuration at ~24GHz toward the prototypical high-mass star-forming\nregion NGC7538IRS1 has allowed us to study the NH3 and thermal CH3OH emission\nand absorption as well as the cm continuum emission at an unprecedented spatial\nresolution of 0.06\"x0.05\", corresponding to a linear resolution of ~150AU at a\ndistance of 2.7kpc. Results: A comparison of these new cm continuum data with\nprevious VLA observations from 23yrs ago reveals no recognizable proper\nmotions. If the emission were caused by a protostellar jet, proper motion\nsignatures should have been easily identified. In combination with the high\nspectral indices S~nu^{alpha} (alpha between 1 and 2), this allows us to\nconclude that the continuum emission is from two hypercompact HII regions\nseparated in projection by about 430AU. The NH3 spectral line data reveal a\ncommon rotating envelope indicating a bound high-mass binary system. In\naddition to this, the thermal CH3OH data show two separate velocity gradients\nacross the two hypercompact HII regions. This indicates two disk-like\nstructures within the same rotating circumbinary envelope. Disk and envelope\nstructures are inclined by ~33deg, which can be explained by initially varying\nangular momentum distributions within the natal, turbulent cloud. Conclusions:\nStudying high-mass star formation at sub-0.1\" resolution allows us to isolate\nmultiple sources as well as to separate circumbinary from disk-like rotating\nstructures.\n", "  Images recorded below the surface of a finger can have more details and be of\nhigher quality than the conventional surface fingerprint images. This is\nparticularly true when the quality of the surface fingerprints is compromised\nby, for example, moisture or surface damage. However, there is an unmet need\nfor an inexpensive fingerprint sensor that is able to acquire high-quality\nimages deep below the surface in short time. To this end, we report on a\ncost-effective full-field optical coherent tomography (FF-OCT) system comprised\nof a silicon camera and a powerful near-infrared LED light source. The system,\nfor example, is able to record 1.7 cm x 1.7 cm en face images in 0.12 s with\nthe spatial sampling rate of 2116 dots per inch and the sensitivity of 93 dB.\nWe show that the system can be used to image internal fingerprints and sweat\nducts with a good contrast. Finally, to demonstrate its biometric performance,\nwe acquired subsurface fingerprint images from 240 individual fingers and\nestimated the equal-error-rate to be ~0.8 %. The developed instrument could\nalso be used in other en face deep-tissue imaging applications because of its\nhigh sensitivity, such as in vivo skin imaging.\n", "  The discovery potential of light pseudo scalar Higgs boson for the mass range\n10-60 GeV is explored. In the context of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric\nstandard(NMSSM) model, the branching fraction of light pseudo scalar Higgs\nboson decaying to a pair of photon can be quite large. A pair of light pseudo\nscalar Higgs boson produced indirectly through the standard model Higgs boson\ndecay yields multiple photons in the final state and the corresponding\nproduction rate is restricted by ATLAS data. Discussing the impact of this\nconstraint in the NMSSM, the detection prospects of light pseudoscalar Higgs\nboson in the channel consisting of at least three photons, a lepton and missing\ntransverse energy are reported. It is observed that the possibilities of\nfinding the pseudoscalar Higgs boson for the above mass range are promising for\nan integrated luminosity $\\mathcal{L}=100 \\text{fb}^{-1}$ with moderate\nsignificances, which can reach to more than 5$\\sigma$ for higher luminosity\noptions.\n", "  We study the experimental constraints on strongly interacting vector-fermions\ncompatible with the relaxion mechanism and investigate any possible tuning. The\nfocus is on a minimal model and low confinement scale. More precisely, we study\nbounds from electroweak precision tests, Higgs decay, Big Bang nucleosynthesis\nand direct collider searches. The effect of these new fermions on vacuum\nstability is also investigated. Combining our bounds, we show that the relaxion\nmechanism becomes increasingly constrained and fine-tuned as the confinement\nscale decreases. For example, a confinement scale of a few tens of MeVs would\nrequire tuning at the percent level.\n", "  Amorphous materials such as metallic, polymeric, and colloidal glasses,\nexhibit complex preparation-dependent mechanical response to applied shear. We\nperform numerical simulations to investigate the mechanical response of binary\nLennard-Jones glasses undergoing athermal, quasistatic pure shear as a function\nof the cooling rate $R$ used to prepare them. The ensemble-averaged stress\nversus strain curve $\\langle\\sigma(\\gamma)\\rangle$ resembles the spatial\naverage in the large size limit, which appears smooth and displays a putative\nelastic regime at small strains, a yielding-related peak at intermediate\nstrain, and a plastic flow regime at large strains. In contrast, for each glass\nconfiguration in the ensemble, the stress-strain curve consists of many short\nnearly linear segments that are punctuated by particle-rearrangement-induced\nrapid stress drops. We quantify the shape of the small stress-strain segments,\nas well as the frequency and size of the stress drops in each glass\nconfiguration. We decompose the stress loss into the loss from particle\nrearrangements and from softening i.e., the reduction of the slopes of the\nlinear segments in $\\sigma(\\gamma)$), and then compare the two contributions as\na function of $R$ and $\\gamma$. For the current studies, the\nrearrangement-induced stress loss is larger than the softening-induced stress\nloss, however, softening stress losses increase with decreasing cooling rate.\nWe also characterize the structure of the potential energy landscape along the\nstrain direction for glasses prepared with different $R$, and observe a\ndramatic change of the properties of the landscape near the yielding\ntransition. We then show that the rearrangement-induced energy loss per strain\ncan serve as an order parameter for the yielding transition, which sharpens for\nslow cooling rates and in the large system-size limit.\n", "  The topological nature of magnetic-vortex state gives rise to peculiar\nmagnetization reversal observed in magnetic microdisks. Interestingly,\nmagnetostatic and exchange energies which drive this reversal can be\neffectively controlled in artificial ferrimagnet heterostructures composed of\nrare-earth and transition metals. 25x[Py(t)/Gd(t)] (t=1 or 2 nm) superlattices\ndemonstrate a pronounced change of the magnetization and exchange stiffness in\na 10-300 K temperature range as well as very small magnetic anisotropy. Due to\nthese properties, the magnetization of cylindrical microdisks composed of these\nartificial ferrimagnets can be transformed from the vortex to\nuniformly-magnetized states in a permanent magnetic field by changing the\ntemperature. We explored the behavior of magnetization in 1.5-micrometer\n25x[Py(t)/Gd(t)] (t=1 or 2 nm) disks at different temperatures and magnetic\nfields and observed that due to the energy barrier separating vortex and\nuniformly-magnetized states, the vortex nucleation and annihilation occur at\ndifferent temperatures. This causes the temperature dependences of the Py/Gd\ndisks magnetization to demonstrate unique hysteretic behavior in a narrow\ntemperature range. It was discovered that for the 25x[Py(2 nm)/Gd(2 nm)]\nmicrodisks the vortex can be metastable at a certain temperature range.\n", "  The polarization exchange effect in a twisted-nematic Fabry-P\\'erot resonator\nis experimentally confirmed in the regimes of both uniform and\nelectric-field-deformed twisted structures. The polarization of output light in\nthe transmission peaks is shown to be linear rather than elliptical. The\npolarization deflection from the nematic director grows from $0^\\circ$ to\n$90^\\circ$ angle and exchanges the longitudinal and transverse directions.\nUntwisting of a nematic by a voltage leads to the rotation of the polarization\nplane of light passing through the resonator. The polarization exchange effect\nallows using the investigated resonator as a spectral-selective linear\npolarizer with the voltage-controlled rotation of the polarization plane.\n", "  A method for circular e$^-$/e$^+$ accelerator beam energy measurement is\nproposed. Coordinate of an electron (or a positron) in a focusing magnetic\nspectrometer built in a circular accelerator depends on its energy, two\nspectrometer parameters, and the circulating beam energy. The spectrometer\nparameters can be defined using minimum electron energies from Compton\nbackscattering with two laser wavelengths, and an additional photon coordinate\ndetector. The photon detector is calibrated at once at well-known beam energy.\nThe VEPP-4M collider has appropriate equipment for the method implementation:\nbuilt-in focusing magnetic spectrometer, Compton calibration system with two\nlasers and a photon coordinate detector. Thus, the proposed technique could be\nimplemented with minimum efforts; tests and further upgrade are planned. The\nbeam energy can be defined with expected uncertainty better than $10^{-4}$.\n", "  Carbon solubility in face-centered cubic Ni-W alloys and the phase diagram of\nC-Ni-W are investigated by means of first principle calculations and semi-grand\ncanonical Monte Carlo simulations. With density functional theory (DFT) total\nenergies as fitting data, we build a superatom model for efficient simulation.\nMulti-histogram analysis is utilized to predict free energies for different\ncompositions and temperatures. By comparing free energies of competing phases,\nwe are able to predict carbon solubility and phase diagrams of C-Ni-W at\ndifferent temperatures. A simple ideal mixing approximation gives qualitatively\nsimilar predictions.\n", "  The worldvolume actions of 3+1 dimensional bosonic branes embedded in a\nfive-dimensional bulk space can lead to important effective field theories,\nsuch as the DBI conformal Galileons, and may, when the Null Energy Condition is\nviolated, play an essential role in cosmological theories of the early\nuniverse. These include Galileon Genesis and \"bouncing\" cosmology, where a\npre-Big Bang contracting phase bounces smoothly to the presently observed\nexpanding universe. Perhaps the most natural arena for such branes to arise is\nwithin the context of superstring and $M$-theory vacua. Here, not only are\nbranes required for the consistency of the theory, but, in many cases, the\nexact spectrum of particle physics occurs at low energy. However, such theories\nhave the additional constraint that they must be $N=1$ supersymmetric. This\nmotivates us to compute the worldvolume actions of $N=1$ supersymmetric\nthree-branes, first in flat superspace and then to generalize them to $N=1$\nsupergravitation. In this paper, for simplicity, we begin the process, not\nwithin the context of a superstring vacuum but, rather, for the conformal\nGalileons arising on a co-dimension one brane embedded in a maximally symmetric\n$AdS_{5}$ bulk space. We proceed to $N=1$ supersymmetrize the associated\nworldvolume theory and then generalize the results to $N=1$ supergravity,\nopening the door to possible new cosmological scenarios.\n", "  We present first evidence for the process $e^+e^-\\to \\gamma\\eta_c(1S)$ at six\ncenter-of-mass energies between 4.01 and 4.60~GeV using data collected by the\nBESIII experiment operating at BEPCII. These data sets correspond to a total\nintegrated luminosity of 4.6~fb$^{-1}$. We measure the Born cross section at\neach energy using a combination of twelve $\\eta_c(1S)$ decay channels. Because\nthe significance of the signal is marginal at each energy ($\\le3.0\\sigma$), we\nalso combine all six energies under various assumptions for the\nenergy-dependence of the cross section. If the process is assumed to proceed\nvia the $Y(4260)$, we measure a peak Born cross section $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{\npeak}}(e^+e^-\\to\\gamma\\eta_c(1S)) = 2.11 \\pm 0.49 (\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm 0.36\n(\\mathrm{syst.})$~pb with a statistical significance of 4.2$\\sigma$.\n", "  We perform the first study of the oscillation frequencies of rapidly rotating\nneutron stars in alternative theories of gravity, focusing mainly on the\nfundamental $f$-modes. We concentrated on a particular class of alternative\ntheories - the (massive) scalar-tensor theories. The generalization to rapid\nrotation is important because on one hand the rapid rotation can magnify the\ndeviations from general relativity compared to the static case and on the other\nhand some of the most efficient emitters of gravitational radiation, such as\nthe binary neutron star merger remnants, are supposed to be rotating close to\ntheir Kepler (mass-shedding) limits shortly after their formation. We have\nconstructed several sequences of models starting from the nonrotating case and\nreaching up to the Kepler limit, with different values of the scalar-tensor\ntheory coupling constant and the scalar field mass. The results show that the\ndeviations from pure Einstein's theory can be significant especially in the\ncase of nonzero scalar field mass. An important property of the oscillation\nmodes of rapidly rotating stars is that they can become secularly unstable due\nto the emission of gravitational radiation, that is so-called\nChandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability. Such unstable modes are efficient\nemitters of gravitational radiation. Our studies show that the inclusion of\nnonzero scalar field would decrease the threshold value of the normalized\nangular momentum where this instability stars to operate, but the growth time\nof the instability seems to be increased compared to pure general relativity.\n", "  We investigate the relation between 4d ambitwistor string theory and on-shell\ndiagrams for planar N=4 super-Yang-Mills and N=8 supergravity, and deduce\nseveral new results about their scattering amplitudes at tree-level and 1-loop.\nIn particular, we derive new Grassmannian integral formulae for tree-level\namplitudes and obtain new worldsheet formulae for 1-loop amplitudes which are\nmanifestly supersymmetric and supported on scattering equations refined by MHV\ndegree.\n", "  Rabi oscillations typify the inherent nonlinearity of optical excitations in\nquantum dots. Using an integral kernel formulation to solve the 3D\nMaxwell-Bloch equations in ensembles of up to $10^4$ quantum dots, we observe\nfeatures in Rabi oscillations due to the interplay of nonlinearity,\nnon-equilibrium excitation, and electromagnetic coupling between the dots. This\napproach allows us to observe the dynamics of each dot in the ensemble without\nresorting to spatial averages. Our simulations predict synchronized multiplets\nof dots that exchange energy, dots that dynamically couple to screen the effect\nof incident external radiation, localization of the polarization due to\nrandomness and interactions, as well as wavelength-scale regions of enhanced\nand suppressed polarization.\n", "  We report measurements of the nonresonant x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES)\nfrom Ni metal in an energy range spanning the K_beta, valence-to-core, and\ndouble-ionization (DI) satellites that appear beyond the single-particle Fermi\nlevel. We make special use of a laboratory-based x-ray spectrometer capable of\nboth x-ray emission and x-ray absorption measurements to accurately align the\nXES and x-ray absorption spectra to a common energy scale. The careful\nalignment of energy scales is requisite for correction of the strong sample\nabsorption of DI fluorescence above the Ni K-edge energy. The successful\ncorrection of absorption effects allows a determination of the branching ratios\nfor the [1s3d], [1s3p], [1s2p] and [1s2s] satellites with respect to their\ncorresponding diagram lines. We compare our results with other work, finding\ngood agreement with prior experiments and with theoretical calculations in the\nmulti-configuration Dirac-Fock framework.\n", "  The low-noise operation of readout electronics in a liquid argon time\nprojection chamber (LArTPC) is critical to properly extract the distribution of\nionization charge deposited on the wire planes of the TPC, especially for the\ninduction planes. This paper describes the characteristics and mitigation of\nthe observed noise in the MicroBooNE detector. The MicroBooNE's single-phase\nLArTPC comprises two induction planes and one collection sense wire plane with\na total of 8256 wires. Current induced on each TPC wire is amplified and shaped\nby custom low-power, low-noise ASICs immersed in the liquid argon. The\ndigitization of the signal waveform occurs outside the cryostat. Using data\nfrom the first year of MicroBooNE operations, several excess noise sources in\nthe TPC were identified and mitigated. The residual equivalent noise charge\n(ENC) after noise filtering varies with wire length and is found to be below\n400 electrons for the longest wires (4.7 m). The response is consistent with\nthe cold electronics design expectations and is found to be stable with time\nand uniform over the functioning channels. This noise level is significantly\nlower than previous experiments utilizing warm front-end electronics.\n", "  The discovery of long-lived electrostatic coherent structures with\nlarge-amplitude electric fields ($1 \\leq E \\leq 500 $ mV/m) by the Van Allen\nProbes has revealed alternative routes through which planetary radiation belts'\nacceleration can take place. Following previous reports showing that small\nphase-space holes, with $q\\phi /T^c_e\\simeq 10^{-2}-10^{-3}$, could result from\nelectron interaction with large-amplitude whistlers, we demonstrate one\npossible mechanism through which holes can grow nonlinearly (i.e. $\\gamma\n\\propto \\sqrt{\\phi}$) and subcritically as a result of momentum exchange\nbetween hot and cold electron populations. Our results provide an explanation\nfor the common occurrence and fast growth of large-amplitude electron\nphase-space holes in the Earth's radiation belts.\n", "  The measured low frequency vibrational energies of some quantum dots (QDs)\ndeviate from the predictions of traditional elastic continuum models. Recent\nexperiments have revealed that these deviations can be tuned by changing the\nligands that passivate the QD surface. This observation has led to speculation\nthat these deviations are due to a mass-loading effect of the surface ligands.\nIn this article, we address this speculation by formulating a continuum elastic\ntheory that includes the mass-loading effects of the surface ligands. We\ndemonstrate that this model is capable of accurately reproducing the $l = 0$\nphonon energy across variety of different QD samples, including cores with\ndifferent ligand identities and epitaxially grown CdSe/CdS core/shell\nheterostructures. We highlight that our model performs well even in the small\nQD regime, where traditional elastic continuum models are especially prone to\nfailure. Furthermore, we show that our model combined with Raman measurements\ncan be used to infer the elastic properties of surface bound ligands, such as\nsound velocities and elastic moduli, that are otherwise challenging.\n", "  In response to the growing need for theoretical tools that can be used in QCD\nto describe and understand the dynamics of gluons in hadrons in the Minkowski\nspace-time, the renormalization group procedure for effective particles (RGPEP)\nis shown in the simplest available context of heavy quarkonia to exhibit a\nwelcome degree of universality in the first approximation it yields once one\nassumes that beyond perturbation theory gluons obtain effective mass. Namely,\nin the second-order terms, the Coulomb potential with Breit-Fermi spin\ncouplings in the effective quark-antiquark component of a heavy quarkonium, is\ncorrected in one-flavor QCD by a spin-independent harmonic oscillator term that\ndoes not depend on the assumed effective gluon mass or the choice of the RGPEP\ngenerator. The new generator we use here is much simpler than the ones used\nbefore and has the advantage of being suitable for studies of the effective\ngluon dynamics at higher orders than the second and beyond the perturbative\nexpansion.\n", "  3+1 dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) describe a quantum\ntheory of fluctuating geometries without the introduction of a background\ngeometry. If the topology of space is constrained to be that of a\nthree-dimensional torus we show that the system will fluctuate around a\ndynamically formed background geometry which can be understood from a simple\nminisuperspace action which contains both a classical part and a quantum part.\nWe determine this action by integrating out degrees of freedom in the full\nmodel, as well as by transfer matrix methods.\n", "  Protoplanetary disks around young stars are the sites of planet formation.\nWhile the dust mass can be estimated using standard methods, determining the\ngas mass - and thus the amount of material available to form giant planets -\nhas proven to be very difficult. Hydrogen deuteride (HD) is a promising\nalternative to the commonly-used gas mass tracer, CO. We aim to examine the\nrobustness of HD as tracer of the disk gas mass, specifically the effect of gas\nmass on the HD FIR emission and its sensitivity to the vertical structure.\nDeuterium chemistry reactions relevant for HD were implemented in the\nthermochemical code DALI and models were run for a range of disk masses and\nvertical structures. The HD J=1-0 line intensity depends directly on the gas\nmass through a sublinear power law relation with a slope of ~0.8. Assuming no\nprior knowledge about the vertical structure of a disk and using only the HD\n1-0 flux, gas masses can be estimated to within a factor of 2 for low mass\ndisks (M$_{\\rm disk} < 10^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$). For more massive disks, this\nuncertainty increases to more than an order of magnitude. Adding the HD 2-1\nline or independent information about the vertical structure can reduce this\nuncertainty to a factor of ~3 for all disk masses. For TW Hya, using the radial\nand vertical structure from Kama et al. 2016b the observations constrain the\ngas mass to $6\\cdot10^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$ < M$_{\\rm disk} < 9\\cdot10^{-3}$\nM$_\\odot$. Future observations require a 5$\\sigma$ sensitivity of\n$1.8\\cdot10^{-20}$ W m$^{-2}$ ($2.5\\cdot10^{-20}$ W m$^{-2}$) and a spectral\nresolving power R > 300 (1000) to detect HD 1-0 (HD 2-1) for all disk masses\nabove $10^{-5}$ M$_\\odot$ with a line-to-continuum ratio > 0.01. These results\nshow that HD can be used as an independent gas mass tracer with a relatively\nlow uncertainty and should be considered as an important science goal for\nfuture FIR missions.\n", "  We revisit the description of inverse Compton scattering sources and the\nphoton beams generated therein, emphasizing the behavior of their phase space\ndensity distributions and how they depend upon those of the two colliding beams\nof electrons and photons. Main objective is to provide practical formulas for\nbandwidth, spectral density, brilliance, which are valid in general for any\nvalue of the recoil factor, i.e. both in the Thomson regime of negligible\nelectron recoil, and in the deep Compton recoil dominated region, which is of\ninterest for gamma-gamma colliders and Compton Sources for the production of\nmulti-GeV photon beams. We adopt a description based on the center of mass\nreference system of the electron-photon collision, in order to underline the\nrole of the electron recoil and how it controls the relativistic Doppler/boost\neffect in various regimes. Comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations of inverse\nCompton scattering in various scenarios are presented, showing very good\nagreement with the analytical formulas: in particular we find that the\nbandwidth dependence on the electron beam emittance, of paramount importance in\nThomson regime, as it limits the amount of focusing imparted to the electron\nbeam, becomes much less sensitive in deep Compton regime, allowing a stronger\nfocusing of the electron beam to enhance luminosity without loss of\nmono-chromaticity. A similar effect occurs concerning the bandwidth dependence\non the frequency spread of the incident photons: in deep recoil regime the\nbandwidth comes out to be much less dependent on the frequency spread.\n", "  We undertook coordinated campaigns with the Green Bank, Effelsberg, and\nArecibo radio telescopes during Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton\nobservations of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 to search for\nsimultaneous radio and X-ray bursts. We find 12 radio bursts from FRB 121102\nduring 70 ks total of X-ray observations. We detect no X-ray photons at the\ntimes of radio bursts from FRB 121102 and further detect no X-ray bursts above\nthe measured background at any time. We place a 5$\\sigma$ upper limit of\n$3\\times10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ on the 0.5--10 keV fluence for X-ray bursts at\nthe time of radio bursts for durations $<700$ ms, which corresponds to a burst\nenergy of $4\\times10^{45}$ erg at the measured distance of FRB 121102. We also\nplace limits on the 0.5--10 keV fluence of $5\\times10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ and\n$1\\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ for bursts emitted at any time during the\nXMM-Newton and Chandra observations, respectively, assuming a typical X-ray\nburst duration of 5 ms. We analyze data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space\nTelescope Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and place a 5$\\sigma$ upper limit on the\n10--100 keV fluence of $4\\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ ($5\\times10^{47}$ erg at\nthe distance of FRB 121102) for gamma-ray bursts at the time of radio bursts.\nWe also present a deep search for a persistent X-ray source using all of the\nX-ray observations taken to date and place a 5$\\sigma$ upper limit on the\n0.5--10 keV flux of $4\\times10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($3\\times10^{41}$\nerg~s$^{-1}$ at the distance of FRB 121102). We discuss these non-detections in\nthe context of the host environment of FRB 121102 and of possible sources of\nfast radio bursts in general.\n", "  We study formation and superfluidity of dipolar excitons in double layer\nheterostructures formed by two transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC)\natomically thin layers. Considering screening effects for an electron-hole\ninteraction via the harmonic oscillator approximation for the Keldysh\npotential, the analytical expressions for the exciton energy spectrum and the\nmean field critical temperature $T_{c}$ for the superfluidity are obtained. It\nis shown that binding energies of A excitons are larger than for B excitons.\nThe mean field critical temperature for a two-component dilute exciton system\nin a TMDC double layer is analyzed and shown that latter is an increasing\nfunction of the factor $Q$, determined by the effective masses of A and B\nexcitons and their reduced mass. Comparison of the calculations for $T_{c}$\nperformed by employing the Coulomb and Keldysh interactions demonstrates the\nimportance of screening effects in TMDC.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the use of nanoscale polarization engineering to\nachieve efficient hole injection from metals to ultra-wide band gap AlGaN, and\nwe show that UV-reflective aluminum (Al) layers can be used for hole injection\ninto p-AlGaN. The dependence of tunneling on the work function of the metal was\ninvestigated, and it was found that highly reflective Al metal layers can\nenable efficient hole injection into p-AlGaN, despite the relatively low work\nfunction of Al. Efficient tunneling hole injection was confirmed by light\nemission at 326 nm with on-wafer peak external quantum efficiency and wall-plug\nefficiency of 2.65% and 1.55%, respectively. A high power density of 83.7 W/cm2\nwas measured at 1200 kA/cm2. The metal/semiconductor tunnel junction structure\ndemonstrated here could provide significant advantages for efficient and\nmanufacturable device topologies for high power UV emitters.\n", "  FUV observations have revealed the transition temperature gas (TTG;\n$\\log{T({\\mathrm{K}})}$ ~ 5), located in the lower Galactic halo and in the\nHigh Velocity Clouds. However, the corresponding X-ray absorption has so far\nremained mostly undetected. In order to make an improvement in this respect in\nGalactic X-ray absorption studies, we accumulated very deep (~3 Ms) spectra of\nthe blazar PKS 2155-304 obtained with the spectrometers RGS1, RGS2, LETG/HRC\nand LETG/ACIS-S and studied the absorption lines due to the intervening\nGalactic components. The very high quality of the data and the coverage of\nimportant wavelengths with at least two independent instruments allowed us to\nreliably detect ten Galactic lines with better than 99.95% confidence. We\ndiscovered significant absorption from blended OIV transitions 1s-2p $^2$S\n(22.571 \\AA ), 1s-2p $^2$P (22.741 \\AA ) and 1s-2p $^2$D (22.777 \\AA ), and\nfrom the OV transition 1s-2p (22.370 \\AA ) from TTG at $\\log{T({\\mathrm{K}})}\n\\thinspace = \\thinspace 5.2\\pm0.1$. A joint X-ray and FUV analysis indicated\nthat photoionisation is negligible for this component and that the gas is in a\ncooling transition phase. However, the temperature is high enough that the\ncolumn density ratio N(OIV)/N(OV) is not significantly different from that in\ncollisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE). Under CIE we obtained\n$N_{\\mathrm{OIV}}$= 3.6$\\pm$2.0 $\\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to\n$N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ = 1.0$\\pm$0.5 $\\times 10^{19}\n\\frac{Z_{\\odot}}{Z_{\\mathrm{TTG}}}$ cm$^{-2}$.\n", "  We analyze universal terms that appear in the large system size scaling of\nthe overlap between the N\\'eel state and the ground state of the spin-1/2 XXZ\nchain in the antiferromagnetic regime. In a critical theory, the order one term\nof the asymptotics of such an overlap may be expressed in terms of $g$-factors,\nknown in the context of boundary conformal field theory. In particular, for the\nXXZ model in its gapless phase, this term provides access to the Luttinger\nparameter. In its gapped phase, on the other hand, the order one term simply\nreflects the symmetry broken nature of the phase. In order to study the large\nsystem size scaling of this overlap analytically and to compute the order one\nterm exactly, we use a recently derived finite-size determinant formula and\nperform an asymptotic expansion. Our analysis confirms the predictions of\nboundary conformal field theory and enables us to determine the exponent of the\nleading finite-size correction.\n", "  We study the effects of supersymmetry on singularity development scenario in\nholography presented in \\cite{Bosch:2017ccw} (BBL). We argue that the\nsingularity persists in a supersymmetric extension of the BBL model. The\nchallenge remains to find a string theory embedding of the singularity\nmechanism.\n", "  We have conducted a large-scale survey of the northern plane using Kiso Wide\nField Camera attached to Schmidt telescope at Kiso observatory. The KISOGP\n(KWFC Intensive Survey of the Galactic Plane) project have made 40-70 epoch\nobservations in I band of about 320 sq. degrees for 5 years starting in 2012.\nThe limiting magnitude is around 16.5 in I. In the data analysis so far, we\ndetected a couple of thousands of variable stars including approximately 100\nCepheids and more than 700 Miras. Roughly 90 percent of them were not\npreviously reported as variable stars, indicating that there are still many\nrelatively bright variables to be found in the Galactic plane.\n", "  Taurid meteor shower produces prolonged but usually low activity every\nOctober and November. In some years, however, the activity is significantly\nenhanced. Previous studies based on long-term activity statistics concluded\nthat the enhancement is caused by a swarm of meteoroids locked in 7:2 resonance\nwith Jupiter. Here we present precise data on 144 Taurid fireballs observed by\nnew digital cameras of the European Fireball Network in the enhanced activity\nyear 2015. Orbits of 113 fireballs show common characteristics and form\ntogether a well defined orbital structure, which we call new branch. We found\nthat this branch is characterized by longitudes of perihelia lying between\n155.9-160o and latitudes of perihelia between 4.2-5.7o. Semimajor axes are\nbetween 2.23-2.28 AU and indeed overlap with the 7:2 resonance. Eccentricities\nare in wide range 0.80-0.90. The orbits form a concentric ring in the inner\nsolar system. The masses of the observed meteoroids were in a wide range from\n0.1 g to more than 1000 kg. We found that all meteoroids larger than 300 g were\nvery fragile, while those smaller than 30 g were much more compact. Based on\norbital characteristics, we argue that asteroids 2015 TX24 and 2005 UR, both of\ndiameters 200-300 meters, are direct members of the new branch. It is therefore\nvery likely that the new branch contains also numerous still not discovered\nobjects of decameter or even larger size. Since asteroids of sizes of tens to\nhundreds meters pose a treat to the ground even if they are intrinsically weak,\nimpact hazard increases significantly when the Earth encounters the Taurid new\nbranch every few years. Further studies leading to better description of this\nreal source of potentially hazardous objects, which can be large enough to\ncause significant regional or even continental damage on the Earth, are\ntherefore extremely important.\n", "  Possible manifestations of the isospin-breaking mixing of the $a^0_0(980)$\nand $f_0(980)$ resonances are analyzed in the $D^0\\to K^0_S \\pi^+\\pi^-$ and\n$D^0\\to K^0_S\\eta\\pi^0$ decays. It is shown that the $a^0_0(980)-f_0(980)$\nmixing has the most influence on the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ mass spectrum in the decay\n$D^0\\to K^0_S\\pi^+\\pi^-$. Owing to the $a^0_0(980)-f_0(980)$ mixing, the\n$f_0(980)$ peak in $D^0 \\to K^0_Sf_0(980)\\to K^0_S \\pi^+\\pi^-$ can experience\ndistortions comparable with its size. The effect essentially depends on the\nrelative phase between the amplitudes of the $D^0\\to K^0_Sf_0(980)$ and $D^0\\to\nK^0_Sa^0_0(980)$ transitions.\n", "  We propose a different route to time-reversal invariant Weyl semimetals\nemploying multilayer heterostructures comprising ordinary \"trivial\" insulators\nand nontrivial insulators with \\textit{pairs} of protected Dirac cones on the\nsurface. We consider both the case of weak topological insualtors, where\nsurface Dirac cones are pinned to time-reversal invariant momenta, and of\ntopological crystalline insulators with unpinned surface Dirac cones. For both\nrealizations we explain phenomenologically how the proposed construction leads\nto the emergence of a Weyl semimetal phase. We further formulate effective\nlow-energy models for which we prove the existence of semimetallic phases with\nfour isolated Weyl points. Finally, we discuss how the proposed design can be\nrealized experimentally with state-of-the-art technologies.\n", "  We show that compounds in a family that possess time-reversal symmetry and\nshare a non-centrosymmetric cubic structure with the space group F-43m (No.\n216) host robust ideal Weyl semi-metal fermions with desirable topologically\nprotected features. The candidates in this family are compounds with different\nchemical formulas AB2, ABC, ABC2, and ABCD and their Fermi levels are\npredominantly populated by nontrivial Weyl fermions. Symmetry of the system\nrequires that the Weyl nodes with opposite chirality are well separated in\nmomentum space. Adjacent Weyl points have the same chirality, thus these Weyl\nnodes would not annihilate each other with respect to lattice perturbations. As\nFermi arcs and surface states connect Weyl nodes with opposite chirality, the\nlarge separation of the latter in momentum space guarantees the appearance of\nvery long arcs and surface states. This work demonstrates the use of system\nsymmetry by first-principles calculations as a powerful recipe for discovering\nnew Weyl semi-metals with attractive features whose protected fermions may be\ncandidates of many applications.\n", "  We calibrate a two-phase xenon detector at 0.27 keV in the charge channel and\nat 2.8 keV in both the light and charge channels using a $^{37}$Ar source that\nis directly released into the detector. We map the light and charge yields as a\nfunction of electric drift field. For the 2.8 keV peak, we calculate the\nThomas-Imel box parameter for recombination and determine its dependence on\ndrift field. For the same peak, we achieve an energy resolution,\n$E_{\\sigma}/E_{mean}$, between 9.8% and 10.8% for 0.1 kV/cm to 2 kV/cm electric\ndrift fields.\n", "  We measured the center-to-limb variation of the brightness temperature,\n$T_b$, from ALMA full-disk images at two frequencies and inverted the solution\nof the transfer equation to obtain the electron temperature, $T_e$ as a\nfunction of optical depth, $\\tau$. The ALMA images are very similar to AIA\nimages at 1600\\AA. The brightness temperature at the center of the disk is 6180\nand 7250 K at 239 and 100 GHz respectively, with dispersions of 100 and 170 K.\nPlage regions stand out clearly in the 239/100 GHz intensity ratio, while\nfaculae and filament lanes do not. The solar disk radius, reduced to 1 AU, is\n$961.1\\pm2.5$ arcsec and $964.1\\pm4.5$ arcsec at 239 and 100 GHz respectively.\nA slight but statistically significant limb brightening is observed at both\nfrequencies. The inversion of the center-to-limb curves shows that $T_e$ varies\nlinearly with the logarithm of optical depth for $0.34<\\tau_{100\\,GHz}<12$,\nwith a slope $d\\ln T_e/d\\tau=-608$ K. Our results are 5% lower than predicted\nby the average quiet sun model C of Fontenla et al. (1993), but do not confirm\nprevious reports that the mm-$\\lambda$ solar spectrum is better fitted with\nmodels of the cell interior.\n", "  We have investigated structures of the ground and excited states of\n$^{16}\\textrm{O}$ with the method of variation after spin-parity projection in\nthe antisymmetrized molecular dynamics model combined with the generator\ncoordinate method of $^{12}\\textrm{C}+\\alpha$ cluster. The calculation\nreasonably reproduces the experimental energy spectra, $E2$, $E3$, $E4$, $IS1$\ntransitions, and $\\alpha$-decay properties. The formation of 4 $\\alpha$\nclusters has been confirmed from nucleon degrees of freedom in the AMD model\nwithout assuming existence of any clusters. They form \"tetrahedral\" $4\\alpha$-\nand $^{12}\\textrm{C}+\\alpha$-cluster structures. The $^{12}\\textrm{C}+\\alpha$\nstructure constructs the $K^\\pi=0^+$ band consisting of the $0^+_2$, $2^+_1$,\nand $4^+_1$ states and the $K^\\pi=0^-$ band of the $1^-_2$, $3^-_2$, and\n$5^-_1$ states. The $0^+_1$, $3^-_1$, and $4^+_2$ states are assigned to the\nground band constructed from the tetrahedral 4$\\alpha$ structure. The $0^+_1$\nand $3^-_1$ are approximately interpreted as $T_d$ band members with the ideal\ntetrahedral configuration. The ground state $4\\alpha$ correlation plays an\nimportant role in enhancement of the $E3$ transition strength to the $3^-_1$.\nThe $4^+_2$ state is not the ideal $T_d$ member but constructed from a\ndistorted tetrahedral $4\\alpha$ structure. Moreover, significant state mixing\nof the tetrahedral $4\\alpha$ and $^{12}\\textrm{C}+\\alpha$ cluster structures\noccurs between $4^+_1$ and $4^+_2$ states, indicating that the $T_d$\nconfiguration of $4\\alpha$ is rather fragile at $J^\\pi=4^+$.\n", "  We construct the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) density operator of the\nspin-1/2 XXZ chain with non-diagonal boundary magnetic fields coupled to\nboundary dissipators. The Markovian boundary dis- sipation is found with which\nthe NESS density operator is expressed in terms of the product of the Lax\noperators by relating the dissipation parameters to the boundary parameters of\nthe spin chain. The NESS density operator can be expressed in terms of a\nnon-Hermitian transfer operator (NHTO) which forms a commuting family of\nquasilocal charges. The optimization of the Mazur bound for the high\ntemperature Drude weight is discussed by using the quasilocal charges and the\nconventional local charges constructed through the Bethe ansatz.\n", "  Real non-symmetric matrices may have either real or complex conjugate\neigenvalues. These matrices can be seen to be pseudo-symmetric as $\\eta M\n\\eta^{-1} = M^t$, where the metric $\\eta$ could be secular (a constant matrix)\nor depending upon the matrix elements of $M$. Here, we construct ensembles of a\nlarge number $N$ of pseudo-symmetric $n \\times n$ ($n$ large) matrices using\n${\\cal N}$ $(n(n+1)/2 \\le {\\cal N} \\le n^2)$ independent and identically\ndistributed (iid) random numbers as their elements. Based on our numerical\ncalculations, we conjecture that for these ensembles the Nearest Level Spacing\nDistributions (NLSDs: $p(s)$) are sub-Wigner as $p_{abc}(s)=a s e^{-bs^c} (0<c\n<2)$ and the distributions of their eigenvalues fit well to $D(\\epsilon)=\nA[\\mbox{tanh}\\{(\\epsilon+B)/C \\}-\\mbox{tanh}\\{(\\epsilon-B)/C\\}]$ (exceptions\nalso discussed). These sub-Wigner NLSD are encountered in Anderson\nmetal-insulator transition and topological transitions in a Josephson junction.\nInterestingly, $p(s)$ for $c=1$ is called semi-Poisson and we show that it lies\nclose to the form $p(s)=0.59 s K_0(0.45 s^2)$ derived for the case of $2 \\times\n2$ pseudo-symmetric matrix where the eigenvalues are most aptly conditionally\nreal: $E_{1,2}=a \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-c^2}$ which represent characteristic coalescing\nof eigenvalues in PT(Parity-Time)-symmetric systems.\n", "  We study the T-dualisability criteria of Chatzistavrakidis, Deser and Jonke\n[3] who recently used Lie algebroid gauge theories to obtain sigma models\nexhibiting a \"T-duality without isometry\". We point out that those\nT-dualisability criteria are not written invariantly in [3] and depend on the\nchoice of the algebroid framing. We then show that there always exists an\nisometric framing for which the Lie algebroid gauging boils down to standard\nYang-Mills gauging. The \"T-duality without isometry\" of Chatzistavrakidis,\nDeser and Jonke is therefore nothing but traditional isometric non-Abelian\nT-duality in disguise.\n", "  The Minimal Lepton Flavour Violation (MLFV) framework is discussed after the\nrecent indication for CP violation in the leptonic sector. Among the three\ndistinct versions of MLFV, the one with degenerate right-handed neutrinos will\nbe disfavoured, if this indication is confirmed. The predictions for leptonic\nradiative rare decays and muon conversion in nuclei are analysed, identifying\nstrategies to disentangle the different MLFV scenarios. The claim that the\npresent anomalies in the semi-leptonic $B$-meson decays can be explained within\nthe MLFV context is critically re-examined concluding that such an explanation\nis not compatible with the present bounds from purely leptonic processes.\n", "  We analyze the scattering of fermions, Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons in\norder to obtain the partial-wave unitarity bounds on dimension-six effective\noperators, including those involving fermions. We also quantify whether, at the\nLHC energies, the dimension-six operators lead to unitarity violation after\ntaking into account the presently available constraints on their Wilson\ncoefficients. Our results show that for most dimension-six operators relevant\nfor the LHC physics there is no unitarity violation at the LHC energies, and\nconsequently, there is no need for the introduction of form factors in the\nexperimental and phenomenological analyses, making them model independent. We\nalso identify two operators for which unitarity violation is still an issue at\nthe LHC Run-II.\n", "  We present a world-sheet formula for all tree level scattering amplitudes, in\nall trace sectors, of four dimensional $\\mathcal{N} \\leq 4$ supersymmetric\nEinstein-Yang-Mills theory, based on the refined scattering equations. This\ngeneralizes previously known formulas for all-trace purely bosonic, or\nsupersymmetric single-trace amplitudes. We find this formula by applying a new\nchiral splitting formula for all CHY Pfaffians in 4d, into two determinants, of\npositive and negative helicity respectively. The splitting of CHY Pfaffians is\nshown to be a special case of the splitting of $T\\mathbb{M}$ valued fermion\ncorrelators on the sphere, which does not require the scattering equations to\nhold, and is a consequence of the isomorphism $T\\mathbb{M} \\simeq \\mathbb{S}^+\n\\otimes \\mathbb{S}^-$ between the tangent bundle of Minkowski space and the\nleft- and right-handed spin bundles. We present and prove this general\nsplitting formula.\n", "  At low temperatures, < 200 mK, the thermal flux through low-dimensional\namorphous dielectric bars, < 2 $\\mu$m wide and 200 nm thick, is transported by\na small number of low-order elastic modes. For long bars, L > 400 $\\mu$m, it is\nknown that the conductance scales as 1/L, where L is the length, but for short\nbars, 1 $\\mu$m < L < 400 $\\mu$m, the length dependence is poorly known.\nAlthough it is assumed that the transport must exhibit a diffusive to ballistic\ntransition, the functional form of the transition and the scale size over which\nthe transition occurs have not, to our knowledge, been measured. In this paper,\nwe use ultra-low-noise superconducting Transition Edge Sensors (TESs) to\nmeasure the heat flux through a set of SiN$_{x}$ bars to establish the\ncharacteristic scale size of the ballistic to diffusive transition. For bars\nsupporting 6 to 7 modes, we measure a thermal elastic-wave attenuation length\nof 20 $\\mu$m. The measurement is important because it sheds light on the\nscattering processes, which in turn are closely related to the generation of\nthermal fluctuation noise. Our own interest lies in creating patterned phononic\nfilters for controlling heat flow and thermal noise in ultra-low-noise devices,\nbut the work will be of interest to others trying to isolate devices from their\nenvironments, and studying loss mechanisms in micro-mechanical resonators.\n", "  Although standard quantum mechanics has some non-local features, the\nprobability current of the Schr\\\"odinger equation is locally conserved, and\nthis allows minimal electromagnetic coupling. For some important extensions of\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation, however, the probability current is not locally\nconserved. We show that in these cases the correct electromagnetic coupling\nrequires a relatively simple extension of Maxwell theory which has been known\nfor some time and recently improved by covariant integration of a scalar degree\nof freedom. We discuss some general properties of the solutions and examine in\nparticular the case of an oscillating dipolar source. Remarkable mathematical\nand physical differences emerge with respect to Maxwell theory, as a\nconsequence of additional current terms present in the equations for $\\nabla\n\\cdot \\textbf{E}$ and $\\nabla \\times \\textbf{B}$. Several possible applications\nare mentioned.\n", "  We present a 3D theoretical comparison between the radiation-pressure forces\nexerted on an atom in an isotropic light cooling scheme and in a six-beam\nmolasses. We demonstrate that, in the case of a background vapor where all the\nspace directions of the atomic motion have to be considered, the mean cooling\nrate is equal in both configurations. Nevertheless, we also point out what\nmainly differentiates the two cooling techniques: the force component\northogonal to the atomic motion. If this transverse force is always null in the\nisotropic light case, it can exceed the radiation-pressure-force longitudinal\ncomponent in the six-beam molasses configuration for high atomic velocities,\nhence reducing the velocity capture range.\n", "  We reconsider the possibility that all standard model gauge couplings blow up\nat a common scale in the ultraviolet. The simplest implementation of this idea\nassumes supersymmetry and the addition of a single vector-like generation of\nmatter fields around the TeV scale. We provide an up-to-date numerical study of\nthis scenario and show that either the scale of the additional matter or the\nscale of supersymmetry breaking falls below potentially relevant LHC bounds. We\nthen consider minimal extensions of the extra matter sector that raise its\nscale above the reach of the LHC, to determine whether there are cases that\nmight be probed at a 100 TeV collider. We also consider the possibility that\nthe heavy matter sector involves new gauge groups constrained by the same\nultraviolet boundary condition, which in some cases can provide an explanation\nfor the multiplicity of heavy states. We comment on the relevance of this\nframework to theories with dark and visible sectors.\n", "  $^{133}\\text{Ba}^+$ has been identified as an attractive ion for quantum\ninformation processing due to the unique combination of its spin-1/2 nucleus\nand visible wavelength electronic transitions. Using a microgram source of\nradioactive material, we trap and laser-cool the synthetic $A$ = 133\nradioisotope of barium II in a radio-frequency ion trap. Using the same, single\ntrapped atom, we measure the isotope shifts and hyperfine structure of the $6^2\n\\text{P}_{1/2}$ $\\leftrightarrow$ $6^2 \\text{S}_{1/2}$ and $6^2 \\text{P}_{1/2}$\n$\\leftrightarrow$ $5^2 \\text{D}_{3/2}$ electronic transitions that are needed\nfor laser cooling, state preparation, and state detection of the clock-state\nhyperfine and optical qubits. We also report the $6^2 \\text{P}_{1/2}$\n$\\leftrightarrow$ $5^2 \\text{D}_{3/2}$ electronic transition isotope shift for\nthe rare $A$ = 130 and 132 barium nuclides, completing the spectroscopic\ncharacterization necessary for laser cooling all long-lived barium II isotopes.\n", "  The entanglement properties of the time periodic Kitaev chain with nearest\nneighbor and next nearest neighbor hopping, is studied. The cases of the exact\neigenstate of the time periodic Hamiltonian, referred to as the Floquet ground\nstate (FGS), as well as a physical state obtained from time-evolving an initial\nstate unitarily under the influence of the time periodic drive are explored.\nTopological phases are characterized by different numbers of Majorana zero\n($\\mathbb{Z}_0$) and $\\pi$ ($\\mathbb{Z}_{\\pi}$) modes, where the zero modes are\npresent even in the absence of the drive, while the $\\pi$ modes arise due to\nresonant driving. The entanglement spectrum (ES) of the FGS as well as the\nphysical state show topological Majorana modes whose number is different from\nthat of the quasi-energy spectrum. The number of Majorana edge modes in the ES\nof the FGS vary in time from $|\\mathbb{Z}_0-\\mathbb{Z}_{\\pi}|$ to\n$\\mathbb{Z}_0+\\mathbb{Z}_{\\pi}$ within one drive cycle, with the maximal\n$\\mathbb{Z}_0+\\mathbb{Z}_{\\pi}$ modes appearing at a special time-reversal\nsymmetric point of the cycle. For the physical state on the other hand, only\nthe modes inherited from the initial wavefunction, namely the $\\mathbb{Z}_0$\nmodes, appear in the ES. The $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\pi}$ modes are absent in the\nphysical state as they merge with the bulk excitations that are simultaneously\ncreated due to resonant driving. The topological properties of the Majorana\nzero and $\\pi$ modes in the ES are also explained by mapping the parent\nwavefunction to a Bloch sphere.\n", "  The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model describes Majorana fermions with random\ninteraction, which displays many interesting properties such as non-Fermi\nliquid behavior, quantum chaos, emergent conformal symmetry and holographic\nduality. Here we consider a SYK model or a chain of SYK models with $N$\nMajorana fermion modes coupled to another SYK model with $N^2$ Majorana fermion\nmodes, in which the latter has many more degrees of freedom and plays the role\nas a thermal bath. For a single SYK model coupled to the thermal bath, we show\nthat although the Lyapunov exponent is still proportional to temperature, it\nmonotonically decreases from $2\\pi/\\beta$ ($\\beta=1/(k_BT)$, $T$ is\ntemperature) to zero as the coupling strength to the thermal bath increases.\nFor a chain of SYK models, when they are uniformly coupled to the thermal bath,\nwe show that the butterfly velocity displays a crossover from a\n$\\sqrt{T}$-dependence at relatively high temperature to a linear $T$-dependence\nat low temperature, with the crossover temperature also controlled by the\ncoupling strength to the thermal bath. If only the end of the SYK chain is\ncoupled to the thermal bath, the model can introduce a spatial dependence of\nboth the Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity. Our models provide\ncanonical examples for the study of thermalization within chaotic models.\n", "  The extent to which a temperature can be appropriately assigned to a small\nquantum system, as an internal property but not as a property of any large\nenvironment, is still an open problem. In this paper, a method is proposed for\nsolving this problem, by which a studied system is coupled to a two-level\nsystem (probe) as a microscopic thermometer. For small quantum chaotic systems,\nwe show that a temperature can be determined, the value of which is sensitive\nto neither the form, location, and strength of the probe-system coupling, nor\nthe Hamiltonian and initial state of the probe. This temperature turns out to\nhave the form of Boltzmann temperature.\n", "  Using an effective Hamiltonian derived from the QCD multipole expansion, we\ncalculate the cross sections of gluo-dissociation of heavy quarkonia in the\nquark-gluon plasma, by including both the chromo-electric dipole ($E_1$) as\nwell as the chromo-magnetic dipole ($M_1$) transition mechanisms. While the\nformer allows to reproduce the results from operator-product-expansion\ncalculations in the Coulomb approximation, the latter as a novel contribution\nis shown to be significant at low energies close to the threshold. Using thus\nobtained cross sections, we further carry out a full calculation of the\ngluo-dissociation rates for various charmonia and bottomonia within a\nnon-relativitic in-medium potential model. The $M_1$ contribution turns out to\nbe most prominent for the $J/\\psi$ and accounts for $\\sim 10\\%-25\\%$ of the\ntotal ($E1+M1$) dissociation rate at temperatures close to the transition\ntemperature.\n", "  The tagging system of the KEDR detector is a symmetrical focusing magnetic\nspectrometer for electrons and positrons scattered at small angles; it is\nembedded into the lattice of the VEPP-4M collider and intended for two-photon\nprocesses study. It measures scattered electron energy with resolution $\\Delta\nE/E_0=0.03\\%...0.6\\%$ ($E_0$ is the beam energy). For precise energy scale\ncalibration two methods are used: tagging of bremsstrahlung electron/positron\nby the photon energy measured by BGO calorimeter, and direct calibration using\nCompton backscattering spectrum edge. This report covers design and current\nstatus of the calibration system.\n", "  We compute the free energy of the planar monomer-dimer model. Unlike the\nclassical planar dimer model, an exact solution is not known in this case. Even\nthe computation of the low-density power series expansion requires heavy and\nnontrivial computations. Despite of the exponential computational complexity,\nwe compute almost three times more terms than were previously known. Such an\nexpansion provides both lower and upper bound for the free energy, and allows\nto obtain more accurate numerical values than previously possible. We expect\nthat our methods can be applied to other similar problems.\n", "  A mixed dimensional system of fermions in two layers immersed in a\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is shown to be a promising setup to realise\ntopological superfluids with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). The induced\ninteraction between the fermions mediated by the BEC gives rise to a\ncompetition between p-wave pairing within each layer and s-wave pairing between\nthe layers. When the layers are far apart, intra-layer pairing dominates and\nthe system forms a topological superfluid either with or without TRS. With\ndecreasing layer separation or increasing BEC coherence length, inter-layer\npairing sets in. We show that this leads either to a second order transition\nbreaking TRS where the edge modes gradually become gapped, or to a first order\ntransition to a topologically trivial s-wave superfluid. Our results provide a\nrealistic roadmap for experimentally realising a topological superfluid with\nTRS in a cold atomic system.\n", "  Based on the algebraic theory of signal processing, we recursively decompose\nthe discrete sine transform of first kind (DST-I) into small orthogonal block\noperations. Using a diagrammatic language, we then second-quantize this\ndecomposition to construct a tensor network implementing the DST-I for\nfermionic modes on a lattice. The complexity of the resulting network is shown\nto scale as $\\frac 54 n \\log n$ (not considering swap gates), where $n$ is the\nnumber of lattice sites. Our method provides a systematic approach of\ngeneralizing Ferris' spectral tensor network for non-trivial boundary\nconditions.\n", "  The goal of the NEXT experiment is the observation of neutrinoless double\nbeta decay in $^{136}$Xe using a gaseous xenon TPC with electroluminescent\namplification and specialized photodetector arrays for calorimetry and\ntracking. The NEXT Collaboration is exploring a number of reconstruction\nalgorithms to exploit the full potential of the detector. This paper describes\none of them: the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) method, a\ngeneric iterative algorithm to find maximum-likelihood estimates of parameters\nthat has been applied to solve many different types of complex inverse\nproblems. In particular, we discuss a bi-dimensional version of the method in\nwhich the photosensor signals integrated over time are used to reconstruct a\ntransverse projection of the event. First results show that, when applied to\ndetector simulation data, the algorithm achieves nearly optimal energy\nresolution (better than 0.5% FWHM at the Q value of $^{136}$Xe) for events\ndistributed over the full active volume of the TPC.\n", "  We demonstrate significantly improved magneto-optical trapping of molecules\nusing a very slow cryogenic beam source and RF modulated and DC magnetic\nfields. The RF MOT confines $1.1(3) \\times 10^5$ CaF molecules at a density of\n$4(1) \\times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$, which is an order of magnitude greater than\nprevious molecular MOTs. Near Doppler-limited temperatures of $340(20)$ $\\mu$K\nare attained. The achieved density enables future work to directly load optical\ntweezers and create optical arrays for quantum simulation.\n", "  The Kepler space mission has made it possible to measure the rotational\nsplittings of mixed modes in red giants, thereby providing an unprecedented\nopportunity to probe the internal rotation of these stars. Asymmetries have\nbeen detected in the rotational multiplets of several red giants. This is\nunexpected since all the red giants whose rotation have been measured thus far\nare found to rotate slowly, and low rotation, in principle, produces\nsymmetrical multiplets. Our aim here is to explain these asymmetries and find a\nway of exploiting them to probe the internal rotation of red giants. We show\nthat in the cases where asymmetrical multiplets were detected, near-degeneracy\neffects are expected to occur, because of the combined effects of rotation and\nmode mixing. Such effects have not been taken into account so far. By using\nboth perturbative and non-perturbative approaches, we show that near-degeneracy\neffects produce multiplet asymmetries that are very similar to the\nobservations. We then propose and validate a method based on the perturbative\napproach to probe the internal rotation of red giants using multiplet\nasymmetries. We successfully apply our method to the asymmetrical $l=2$\nmultiplets of the Kepler young red giant KIC7341231 and obtain precise\nestimates of its mean rotation in the core and the envelope. The observed\nasymmetries are reproduced with a good statistical agreement, which confirms\nthat near-degeneracy effects are very likely the cause of the detected\nmultiplet asymmetries. We expect near-degeneracy effects to be important for\n$l=2$ mixed modes all along the red giant branch (RGB). For $l=1$ modes, these\neffects can be neglected only at the base of the RGB. They must therefore be\ntaken into account when interpreting rotational splittings and as shown here,\nthey can bring valuable information about the internal rotation of red giants.\n", "  An \"ultrafine\" splitting in positronium between the $L=1$ spin-singlet state\nand the spin-average of the spin-triplet states is shown to arise only at order\n$\\alpha^6$. The QED prediction for $n=2$ states is\n$\\Delta_{2,P}=(683/172800)m\\alpha^6=73.7(1.2)$ kHz. This represents the\nsmallest leading-order QED splitting known. Current experimental efforts could\nobserve this splitting, and its observation can constrain new ultralight\ninteractions, such as axions or $Z'$.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the electron current in nanodevices where there are\ntime-varying components and interactions. These devices are a nanojunction\nattached to heat baths and with dynamical electron-phonon interactions and a\nnanojunction with photon beams incident and reflected at the channel. We use\nthe two-time nonequilibrium Green's functions technique to calculate the\ntime-dependent electron current flowing across the devices. We find that\nwhenever a sudden change occurs in the device, the current takes time to react\nto the abrupt change, overshoots, oscillates, and eventually settles down to a\nsteady value. With dynamical electron-phonon interactions, the interaction\ngives rise to a net resistance that reduces the flow of current across the\ndevice when a source-drain bias potential is attached. In the presence of\ndynamical electron-photon interactions, the photons drive the electrons to\nflow. The direction of flow, however, depends on the frequencies of the\nincident photons. Furthermore, the direction of electron flow in one lead is\nexactly opposite to the direction of flow in the other lead thereby resulting\nin no net change in current flowing across the device.\n", "  This work reports on the structural and magnetic properties of\nMn$_{2.7-x}$Fe$_{x}$Ga$_{1.3}$ Heusler films with different Fe content x (0\n$\\leqslant$ x $\\leqslant$ 1.2). The films were deposited heteroepitaxially on\nMgO single crystal substrates, by magnetron sputtering.\nMn$_{2.7-x}$Fe$_{x}$Ga$_{1.3}$ films with the thickness of 35 nm were\ncrystallized in tetragonal D0$_{22}$ structure with (001) preferred\norientation. Tunable magnetic properties were achieved by changing the Fe\ncontent x. Mn$_{2.7-x}$Fe$_{x}$Ga$_{1.3}$ thins films exhibit high uniaxial\nanisotropy Ku $\\geqslant$ 1.4 MJ/m3, coercivity from 0.95 to 0.3 T and\nsaturation magnetization from 290 to 570 kA/m. The film with\nMn$_{1.6}$Fe$_{1.1}$Ga$_{1.3}$ composition shows high Ku of 1.47 MJ/m3 and\nenergy product ${(BH)_{max}}$ of 37 kJ/m3, at room temperature. These findings\ndemonstrate that Mn$_{2.7-x}$Fe$_{x}$Ga$_{1.3}$ films have promising properties\nfor mid-range permanent magnet and spintronic applications.\n", "  Molecular adsorption on surfaces plays an important part in catalysis,\ncorrosion, desalination, and various other processes that are relevant to\nindustry and in nature. As a complement to experiments, accurate adsorption\nenergies can be obtained using various sophisticated electronic structure\nmethods that can now be applied to periodic systems. The adsorption energy of\nwater on boron nitride substrates, going from zero to 2-dimensional\nperiodicity, is particularly interesting as it calls for an accurate treatment\nof polarizable electrostatics and dispersion interactions, as well as posing a\npractical challenge to experiments and electronic structure methods. Here, we\npresent reference adsorption energies, static polarizabilities, and dynamic\npolarizabilities, for water on BN substrates of varying size and dimension.\nAdsorption energies are computed with coupled cluster theory, fixed-node\nquantum Monte Carlo (FNQMC), the random phase approximation (RPA), and second\norder M{\\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) theory. These explicitly correlated methods are\nfound to agree in molecular as well as periodic systems. The best estimate of\nthe water/h-BN adsorption energy is $-107\\pm7$ meV from FNQMC. In addition, the\nwater adsorption energy on the BN substrates could be expected to grow\nmonotonically with the size of the substrate due to increased dispersion\ninteractions but interestingly, this is not the case here. This peculiar\nfinding is explained using the static polarizabilities and molecular dispersion\ncoefficients of the systems, as computed from time-dependent density functional\ntheory (DFT). Dynamic as well as static polarizabilities are found to be highly\nanisotropic in these systems. In addition, the many-body dispersion method in\nDFT emerges as a particularly useful estimation of finite size effects for\nother expensive, many-body wavefunction based methods.\n", "  We present the three-loop calculation of the Bremsstrahlung function\nassociated to the 1/2-BPS cusp in ABJM theory, including color subleading\ncorrections. Using the BPS condition we reduce the computation to that of a\ncusp with vanishing angle. We work within the framework of heavy quark\neffective theory (HQET) that further simplifies the analytic evaluation of the\nrelevant cusp anomalous dimension in the near-BPS limit. The result passes\nnontrivial tests, such as exponentiation, and is in agreement with the\nconjecture made in [1] for the exact expression of the Bremsstrahlung function,\nbased on the relation with fermionic latitude Wilson loops.\n", "  We report on high frequency resolution coherent nonlinear optical\nspectroscopy on an ensemble of InGaN disks in GaN nanowires at 300 K.\nSub-$\\mu$eV resonances in the inhomogeneously broadened third order\n($\\chi^{(3)}$) absorption spectrum show asymmetric line shapes, where the\ndegree of asymmetry depends on the wavelength of the excitation beams. Theory\nbased on the Optical Bloch Equations (OBE) indicates that the lineshape\nasymmetry is a result of fast decoherence in the system and the narrow\nresonances originate from coherent population pulsations that are induced by\ndecoherence in the system. Using the OBE, we estimate that the decoherence time\nof the optically induced dipole (formed between the unexcited ground state the\nexcited electron-hole pair) at room temperature is 125 fs, corresponding to a\nlinewidth of ~10 meV. The decay time of the excitation is ~5-10 ns, depending\non the excitation energy. The lineshapes are well fit with the OBE indicating\nthat the resonances are characterized by discrete levels with no evidence of\nmany body physics.\n", "  Extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics [Phys. Rev. Lett.,\n${\\bf 100}$, 123004 (2008)] is formulated for general Hohenberg-Kohn density\nfunctional theory and compared to the extended Lagrangian framework of first\nprinciples molecular dynamics by Car and Parrinello [Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\\bf\n55}$, 2471 (1985)]. It is shown how extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer\nmolecular dynamics overcomes several shortcomings of regular, direct\nBorn-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, while improving or maintaining important\nfeatures of Car-Parrinello simulations. The accuracy of the electronic degrees\nof freedom in extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, with\nrespect to the exact Born-Oppenheimer solution, is of second order in the size\nof the integration time step and of fourth order in the potential energy\nsurface. Improved stability over recent formulations of extended Lagrangian\nBorn-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics is achieved by generalizing the theory to\nfinite temperature ensembles, using fractional occupation numbers in the\ncalculation of the inner-product kernel of the extended harmonic oscillator\nthat appears as a preconditioner in the electronic equations of motion.\nMaterials systems that normally exhibit slow self-consistent field convergence\ncan be simulated using integration time steps of the same order as in direct\nBorn-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, but without the requirement of an\niterative, non-linear electronic ground state optimization prior to the force\nevaluations and without a systematic drift in the total energy. In combination\nwith proposed low-rank and on-the-fly updates of the kernel, this formulation\nprovides an efficient and general framework for quantum based Born-Oppenheimer\nmolecular dynamics simulations.\n", "  There is a considerable deficiency in the number of known supernova remnants\n(SNRs) in the Galaxy compared to that expected. Searches for extended\nlow-surface brightness radio sources may find new Galactic SNRs, but confusion\nwith the much larger population of HII regions makes identifying such features\nchallenging. SNRs can, however, be separated from HII regions using their\nsignificantly lower mid-infrared (MIR) to radio continuum intensity ratios. We\nuse the combination of high-resolution 1-2 GHz continuum data from The HI, OH,\nRecombination line survey of the Milky Way (THOR) and lower-resolution VLA 1.4\nGHz Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS) continuum data, together with MIR data from\nthe Spitzer GLIMPSE, Spitzer MIPSGAL, and WISE surveys to identify SNR\ncandidates. To ensure that the candidates are not being confused with HII\nregions, we exclude radio continuum sources from the WISE Catalog of Galactic\nHII Regions, which contains all known and candidate H II regions in the Galaxy.\nWe locate 76 new Galactic SNR candidates in the THOR and VGPS combined survey\narea of 67.4deg>l>17.5deg, |b|<1.25deg and measure the radio flux density for\n52 previously-known SNRs. The candidate SNRs have a similar spatial\ndistribution to the known SNRs, although we note a large number of new\ncandidates near l=30deg, the tangent point of the Scutum spiral arm. The\ncandidates are on average smaller in angle compared to the known regions,\n6.4'+/-4.7' versus 11.0'+/-7.8', and have lower integrated flux densities. If\nthe 76 candidates are confirmed as true SNRs, for example using radio\npolarization measurements or by deriving radio spectral indices, this would\nmore than double the number of known Galactic SNRs in the survey area. This\nlarge increase would still, however, leave a discrepancy between the known and\nexpected SNR populations of about a factor of two.\n", "  We continue to investigate the dual description of the Virasoro conformal\nblocks arising in the framework of the classical limit of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$\ncorrespondence. To give such an interpretation in previous studies, certain\nrestrictions were necessary. Our goal here is to consider more general\nsituation available through the worldline approximation to the dual AdS\ngravity. Namely, we are interested in computing the spherical conformal blocks\nwithout the previously imposed restrictions on the conformal dimensions of the\ninternal channels. The duality is realised as an equality of the so-called\nheavy-light limit of the n-point conformal block and the action of n-2\nparticles propagating in some AdS-like background with either a conical\nsingularity or a BTZ black hole. We describe a procedure that allows relaxing\nthe constraint on the intermediate channels. To obtain an explicit expression\nfor the conformal block on the CFT side, we use a recently proposed recursion\nprocedure and find full agreement between the results of the boundary and bulk\ncomputations.\n", "  In the online social dynamics, a robust scaling behaviour appears as a key\nfeature of many collaborative efforts that lead to the new social value. The\nunderlying empirical data thus offer a unique opportunity to study the origin\nof self-organised criticality in social systems. In contrast to physical\nsystems in the laboratory, various human attributes of the actors play an\nessential role in the process along with the contents (cognitive, emotional) of\nthe communicated artefacts. As a prototypal example, we consider the social\nendeavour of knowledge creation via Questions\\ \\& Answers (Q\\&A). Using a large\nempirical dataset from one of such Q\\&A sites and theoretical modelling, we\nexamine the temporal correlations at all scales and the role of cognitive\ncontents to the avalanches of the knowledge creation process. Our analysis\nshows that the long-range correlations and the event clustering are primarily\ndetermined by the universal social dynamics, providing the external driving of\nthe system by the arrival of new users. While the involved cognitive contents\n(systematically annotated in the data and observed in the model) are crucial\nfor a fine structure of the developing knowledge networks, they only affect the\nvalues of the scaling exponents and the geometry of large avalanches and shape\nthe multifractal spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the level of the activity\nof the communities that share the knowledge correlates with the fluctuations of\nthe innovation rate, implying that the increase of innovation may serve as the\nactive principle of self-organisation. To identify relevant parameters and\nunravel the role of the network evolution underlying the process in the social\nsystem under consideration, we compare the social avalanches to the avalanche\nsequences occurring in the field-driven physical model of disordered solids.\n", "  [Herdeiro & Doyon Phys., Rev., E (2016)]\nhttps://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.94.043322 introduced a\nnumerical recipe, dubbed UV sampler, offering precise estimations of the CFT\ndata of the planar two-dimensional critical Ising model. It made use of scale\ninvariance emerging at the critical point in order to sample finite sublattice\nmarginals of the infinite plane Gibbs measure of the model by producing\n``holographic\" boundary distributions. The main ingredient of the Markov chain\nMonteCarlo (MCMC) sampler is the invariance under dilation. This article\npresents a generalization to higher dimensions with the critical 3d Ising\nmodel. This leads to numerical estimations of a subset of the CFT data -\nscaling weights and structure constants - through fitting of measured\ncorrelation functions. The results are shown to agree with the recent most\nprecise estimations from numerical bootstrap methods\n\\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04436}{[Kos,\\;Poland,\\;Vicci\\;\\&\\;Simmons-Duffin\nJHEP (2016)]}.\n", "  Iron-based chalcogenides are complex superconducting systems in which\norbitally-dependent electronic correlations play an important role. Here, using\nhigh-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we investigate the\neffect of these electronic correlations outside the nematic phase in the\ntetragonal phase of superconducting FeSe1-xSx (x = 0; 0:18; 1). With increasing\nsulfur substitution, the Fermi velocities increase significantly and the band\nrenormalizations are suppressed towards a factor of 1.5-2 for FeS. Furthermore,\nthe chemical pressure leads to an increase in the size of the quasi-two\ndimensional Fermi surface, compared with that of FeSe, however, it remains\nsmaller than the predicted one from first principle calculations for FeS. Our\nresults show that the isoelectronic substitution is an effective way to tune\nelectronic correlations in FeSe1-xSx, being weakened for FeS with a lower\nsuperconducting transition temperature. This suggests indirectly that\nelectronic correlations could help to promote higher-Tc superconductivity in\nFeSe.\n", "  We investigate the quantization of adiabatic charge transport in the\ninsulating ground state of finite systems. Topological charge pumps are used in\nexperiments as an indicator of topological order. In the thermodynamic limit\nthe transport can be related to a topological Berry phase and is thus strictly\nquantized. This is no longer true for finite systems. We derive finite-size\ncorrections to the transport both for non-interacting and interacting systems\nand relate them to analytic properties of the single- and many-body Berry\ncurvature. We find that they depend on the details of experimental realizations\nof the pumps. While they can be non-negligible even in large systems, a proper\nchoice of the pumping protocol can suppress these corrections.\n", "  We consider opto- and electro-mechanical quantum systems composed of a driven\ncavity mode interacting with a set of mechanical resonators. It has been\nproposed that the latter can be initialized in arbitrary cluster states,\nincluding universal resource states for Measurement Based Quantum Computation\n(MBQC). We show that, despite the unavailability in this set-up of direct\nmeasurements over the mechanical resonators, computation can still be performed\nto a high degree of accuracy. In particular, it is possible to indirectly\nimplement the measurements necessary for arbitrary Gaussian MBQC by properly\ncoupling the mechanical resonators to the cavity field and continuously\nmonitoring the leakage of the latter. We provide a thorough theoretical\nanalysis of the performances obtained via indirect measurements, comparing them\nwith what is achievable when direct measurements are instead available. We show\nthat high levels of fidelity are attainable in parameter regimes within reach\nof present experimental capabilities.\n", "  Antiproton--proton annihilation into light neutral mesons in the few GeV\nenergy domain is investigated in view of a global description of the existing\ndata and predictions for future experiments at PANDA, FAIR. An effective meson\nmodel earlier developed, with mesonic and baryonic degrees of freedom in $s$,\n$t$, and $u$ channels, is applied here to $\\pi^0\\pi^0$ production. Form factors\nwith logarithmic $s$ and $t(u)$ dependencies are applied. A fair agreement with\nthe existing angular distributions is obtained. Applying SU(3) symmetry, it is\nstraightforward to recover the angular distributions for $ \\pi^0\\eta$, and\n$\\eta\\eta$ production in the same energy range. A good agreement is generally\nobtained with all existing data.\n", "  We propose an $A_4$ extension of the Standard Model with a Lepton Quarticity\nsymmetry correlating dark matter stability with the Dirac nature of neutrinos.\nThe flavor symmetry predicts (i) a generalized bottom-tau mass relation\ninvolving all families, (ii) small neutrino masses are induced a la seesaw,\n(iii) CP must be significantly violated in neutrino oscillations, (iv) the\natmospheric angle $\\theta_{23}$ lies in the second octant, and (v) only the\nnormal neutrino mass ordering is realized.\n", "  We present a new analysis of the widely used relation between cavity power\nand radio luminosity in clusters of galaxies with evidence for strong AGN\nfeedback. We study the correlation at low radio frequencies using two new\nsurveys - the First Alternative Data Release of the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS\nADR1) at 148 MHz and LOFAR's first all-sky survey, the Multifrequency Snapshot\nSky Survey (MSSS) at 140 MHz. We find a scaling relation $P_{\\rm cav} \\propto\nL_{148}^{\\beta}$, with a logarithmic slope of $\\beta = 0.51 \\pm 0.14$, which is\nin good agreement with previous results based on data at 327 MHz. The large\nscatter present in this correlation confirms the conclusion reached at higher\nfrequencies that the total radio luminosity at a single frequency is a poor\npredictor of the total jet power. We show that including measurements at 148\nMHz alone is insufficient to reliably compute the bolometric radio luminosity\nand reduce the scatter in the correlation. For a subset of four well-resolved\nsources, we examine the detected extended structures at low frequencies and\ncompare with the morphology known from higher frequency images and Chandra\nX-ray maps. In Perseus we discuss details in the structures of the radio\nmini-halo, while in the 2A 0335+096 cluster we observe new diffuse emission\nassociated with multiple X-ray cavities and likely originating from past\nactivity. For A2199 and MS 0735.6+7421, we confirm that the observed\nlow-frequency radio lobes are confined to the extents known from higher\nfrequencies. This new low-frequency analysis highlights the fact that existing\ncavity power to radio luminosity relations are based on a relatively narrow\nrange of AGN outburst ages. We discuss how the correlation could be extended\nusing low frequency data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) in\ncombination with future, complementary deeper X-ray observations.\n", "  The electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal oxyhalide compound\nCo2TeO3Cl2 is investigated using first principle calculations within the\nframework of density functional theory. In order to find underlying spin\nlattice of this compound, various hopping integrals and exchange interactions\nare calculated. The calculations reveal that the dominant inter-chain and\nintra-chain interactions are in ab plane. The exchange path is visualised by\nWannier function plotting. The nearest neighbour and next nearest neighbour\nexchange interactions are antiferromagnetic, making the system frustrated in\nlow dimension. The importance of spin orbit coupling in this compound is also\ninvestigated. The spin quantization axis is favoured along the crystallographic\nb direction.\n", "  We discuss application of formalism of small-$x$ effective action for\nreggeized gluons, \\cite{Gribov,LipatovEff,BFKL}, for the calculation of\nclassical gluon field of relativistic color charge, similarly to that done in\nCGC approach of \\cite{Venug,Kovner}. The equations of motion with the reggeon\nfields are solved in LO and NLO approximations and new solutions are found. The\nresults are compared to the calculations performed in the CGC framework and it\nis demonstrated that the LO CGC results for the classical field are reproduced\nin our calculations. Possible applications of the NLO solution in the effective\naction and CGC frameworks are discussed as well.\n", "  The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard model (NMSSM) appears as an\ninteresting candidate for the interpretation of the Higgs-measurement at the\nLHC and as a rich framework embedding physics beyond the Standard Model. We\nconsider the renormalization of the Higgs sector of this model in its\n$\\mathcal{CP}$-violating version, and propose a renormalization scheme for the\ncalculation of on-shell Higgs masses. Moreover, the connection between the\nphysical states and the tree-level ones is no longer trivial at the radiative\nlevel: a proper description of the corresponding transition thus proves\nnecessary in order to calculate Higgs production and decays at a consistent\nloop order. After discussing these formal aspects, we compare the results of\nour mass calculation to the output of existing tools. We also study the\nrelevance of the on-shell transition-matrix in the example of the $h_i \\to\n\\tau^+ \\tau^-$ width. We find deviations between our full prescription and\npopular approximations that can exceed $10\\%$.\n", "  We study thermoelectric effects in Coulomb-coupled quantum-dot (CCQD) systems\nbeyond lowest-order tunneling processes and the often applied wide-band\napproximation. To this end, we present a master-equation (ME) approach based on\na perturbative $T$-matrix calculation of the charge and heat tunneling rates\nand transport currents. Applying the method to transport through a\nnon-interacting single-level QD, we demonstrate excellent agreement with the\nLandauer-B{\\\"u}ttiker theory when higher-order (cotunneling) processes are\nincluded in the ME. Next, we study the effect of cotunneling and\nenergy-dependent lead couplings on the heat currents in a system of two\nCoulomb-coupled QDs. Overall, we find that cotunneling processes (i) dominate\nthe heat currents at low temperature and bias, and (ii) give rise to a\npronounced reduction of the cooling power achievable with the recently\ndemonstrated Maxwell's demon cooling mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat the cooling power can be boosted significantly by carefully engineering\nthe energy dependence of the lead couplings to filter out undesired transport\nprocesses. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering higher-order\ncotunneling processes as well as the advantage of engineered energy-dependent\nlead couplings in the optimization of the thermoelectric performance of\nCoulomb-coupled QD systems.\n", "  Two-dimensional conformal field theories at large central charge and with a\nsufficiently sparse spectrum of light states have been shown to exhibit\nuniversal thermodynamics. This thermodynamics matches that of AdS$_3$ gravity,\nwith a Hawking-Page transition between thermal AdS and the BTZ black hole. We\nextend these results to correlation functions of light operators. Upon making\nsome additional assumptions, such as large $c$ factorization of correlators, we\nestablish that the thermal AdS and BTZ solutions emerge as the universal\nbackgrounds for the computation of correlators. In particular, Witten diagrams\ncomputed on these backgrounds yield the CFT correlators, order by order in a\nlarge $c$ expansion, with exponentially small corrections. In pure CFT terms,\nour result is that thermal correlators of light operators are determined\nentirely by light spectrum data. Our analysis is based on the constraints of\nmodular invariance applied to the torus two-point function.\n", "  We use brane techniques to study the space of vacua of abelian 3d\n$\\mathcal{N}=3$ gauge theories. The coordinates on these spaces are the vevs of\nchiral monopole and meson operators, which are realized in the type IIB brane\nconfiguration of the theory by adding semi-infinite $(1,k)$ strings or F1\nstrings. The study of various brane setups allows us to determine a basis of\nchiral operators and chiral ring relations relevant to each branch of vacua,\nleading to the algebraic description of these branches. The method is mostly\ngraphical and does not require actual computations. We apply it and provide\nexplicit results in various examples. For linear quivers we find that the space\nof vacua has in general a collection of Coulomb-like branches, a Higgs branch\nand mixed branches. For circular quivers we find an extra branch, the geometric\nbranch, parametrized by monopoles with equal magnetic charges in all $U(1)$\nnodes and meson operators. We explain how to include FI and mass deformations.\nWe also study $\\mathcal{N}=3$ theories realized with $(p,q)$ 5-branes.\n", "  Electronic nematics are exotic states of matter where electronic interactions\nbreak a rotational symmetry of the underlying lattice, in analogy to the\ndirectional alignment without translational order in nematic liquid crystals.\nIntriguingly such phases appear in the copper- and iron-based superconductors,\nand their role in establishing high-temperature superconductivity remains an\nopen question. Nematicity may take an active part, cooperating or competing\nwith superconductivity, or may appear accidentally in such systems. Here we\npresent experimental evidence for a phase of nematic character in the heavy\nfermion superconductor CeRhIn5. We observe a field-induced breaking of the\nelectronic tetragonal symmetry of in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nquantum phase transition at Hc~50T. This phase appears in out-of-plane fields\nof H*~28T and is characterized by substantial in-plane resistivity anisotropy.\nThe anisotropy can be aligned by a small in-plane field component, with no\napparent connection to the underlying crystal structure. Furthermore no\nanomalies are observed in the magnetic torque, suggesting the absence of\nmetamagnetic transitions in this field range. These observations are indicative\nof an electronic nematic character of the high field state in CeRhIn5. The\nappearance of nematic behavior in a phenotypical heavy fermion superconductor\nhighlights the interrelation of nematicity and unconventional\nsuperconductivity, suggesting nematicity to be a commonality in such materials.\n", "  The processes $e^{+}e^{-}\\!\\to\\! (f_1(1285), a_1(1260))\\gamma$ in threshold\ndomain are considered in the framework of the extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio\nmodel. The channels with the ground $\\rho(770)$, $\\omega(782)$ and radially\nexcited $\\rho(1450)$, $\\omega(1420)$ intermediate meson states are taken into\naccount. It is shown that in the process $e^{+}e^{-}\\to f_1(1285)\\gamma$, the\nprobability of the subprocesses with $\\rho$-mesons significantly exceeds the\nprobability of the subprocesses with $\\omega$-mesons, whereas, in the process\n$e^{+}e^{-} \\to a_1(1260) \\gamma$, $\\rho$- and $\\omega$-channels give\napproximately equal contributions. The mechanism of this effect is discussed.\nThe radiative decay widths of $\\rho(1450)\\!\\to\\! f_{1}(1285)\\gamma$,\n$\\omega(1420)\\!\\to\\! f_{1}(1285)\\gamma$, $\\rho(1450)\\!\\to\\! a_1(1260)\\gamma$\nand $\\omega(1420)\\!\\to\\! a_1(1260)\\gamma$ are calculated.\n", "  We present the results of measurements demonstrating the efficiency of the\nEDELWEISS-III array of cryogenic germanium detectors for direct dark matter\nsearches. The experimental setup and the FID (Fully Inter-Digitized) detector\narray is described, as well as the efficiency of the double measurement of heat\nand ionization signals in background rejection. For the whole set of 24 FID\ndetectors used for coincidence studies, the baseline resolutions for the\nfiducial ionization energy are mainly below 0.7 keV$_{ee}$ (FHWM) whereas the\nbaseline resolutions for heat energies are mainly below 1.5 keV$_{ee}$ (FWHM).\nThe response to nuclear recoils as well as the very good discrimination\ncapability of the FID design has been measured with an AmBe source. The surface\n$\\beta$- and $\\alpha$-decay rejection power of $R_{\\rm surf} < 4 \\times\n10^{-5}$ per $\\alpha$ at 90% C.L. has been determined with a $^{210}$Pb source,\nthe rejection of bulk $\\gamma$-ray events has been demonstrated using\n$\\gamma$-calibrations with $^{133}$Ba sources leading to a value of\n$R_{\\gamma{\\rm -mis-fid}} < 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ at 90% C.L.. The current levels\nof natural radioactivity measured in the detector array are shown as the rate\nof single $\\gamma$ background. The fiducial volume fraction of the FID\ndetectors has been measured to a weighted average value of $(74.6 \\pm 0.4)\\%$\nusing the cosmogenic activation of the $^{65}$Zn and $^{68,71}$Ge isotopes. The\nstability and uniformity of the detector response is also discussed. The\nachieved resolutions, thresholds and background levels of the upgraded\nEDELWEISS-III detectors in their setup are thus well suited to the direct\nsearch of WIMP dark matter over a large mass range.\n", "  In the last years, the ability of cold atoms experiments to explore\ncondensed- matter related questions has dramatically progressed. Transport\nexperiments, in particular, have expanded to the point that conductances and\nother transport coefficients can now be measured in a way directly analogous to\nsolid state physics, extending cold atoms based quantum simulations into the\ndomain of quantum electronic devices. In this topical review, we describe the\ntransport experiments performed with cold gases in the two terminals\nconfiguration, with an emphasis on the specific features of cold atomic gases\ncompared to solid state physics. We present the experimental techniques and the\nmain experimental findings, focusing on but not restricted to the recent\nexperiments performed in our group. We eventually discuss the perspectives\nopened by this approach, the main technical and conceptual challenges for\nfuture developments, and the potential applications as a quantum simulator for\ntransport phenomena and mesoscopic physics problems.\n", "  The study of nonstationary processes in the Sun is of great interest, and\nlately, multiwavelength observations and registration of magnetic fields are\ncarried out by means of both ground-based telescopes and several specialized\nspacecraft (SC) on near-Earth orbits. However the acquisition of the new\nreliable information on their hard X-ray radiation remains demanded, in\nparticular if the corresponding SC provide additional information, e.g. in\nregard to the flare observations from the directions other than the Sun-Earth\ndirection. In this article we present a catalog of powerful solar flares\nregistered by the High Energy Neutron Detector (HEND) device designed in the\nSpace Research Institute (IKI) of Russian Academy of Sciences. HEND is mounted\nonboard the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft. It worked successfully during the\nflight to Mars and currently operates in the near-Mars orbit. Besides neutrons,\nthe HEND instrument is sensitive to the hard X-ray and gamma radiation. This\nradiation is registered by two scintillators: the outer one is sensitive to the\nphotons above 40 keV and the inner one to the photons above 200 keV. The\ncatalog was created with the new procedure of the data calibration. For most\npowerful 60 solar flares on the visible and on the far sides of the Sun (in\nrespect to a terrestrial observer), we provide time profiles of flare\nradiation, summed over all the channels of X-ray and in some cases of gamma-ray\nbands as well as the spectra and characteristics of their power law\napproximation. We briefly discuss the results of the previous articles on the\nstudy of the Sun with HEND instrument and the potential of the further use of\nthese data.\n", "  We performed comparative experimental investigation of superconducting NbN\nnanowires which were prepared by means of positive-and negative electron-beam\nlithography with the same positive tone Poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) resist.\nWe show that nanowires with a thickness 4.9 nm and widths less than 100 nm\ndemonstrate at 4.2 K higher critical temperature and higher density of critical\nand retrapping currents when they are prepared by negative lithography. Also\nthe ratio of the experimental critical-current to the depairing critical\ncurrent is larger for nanowires prepared by negative lithography. We associate\nthe observed enhancement of superconducting properties with the difference in\nthe degree of damage that nanowire edges sustain in the lithographic process. A\nwhole range of advantages which is offered by the negative lithography with\npositive PMMA resist ensures high potential of this technology for improving\nperformance metrics of superconducting nanowire singe-photon detectors.\n", "  We demonstrate incoherent broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy\nin the mid-infrared wave- length range from 3000 to 3450 nm using an all-fiber\nbased supercontinuum source. Multi-components gas detection is performed and\nconcentrations of acetylene and methane are retrieved with sub-ppm accuracy. A\nlinear response to nominal gas concentrations is observed demonstrating the\nfeasibility of the method for sensing applications.\n", "  We calculate power corrections to TMD factorization for particle production\nby gluon-gluon fusion in hadron-hadron collisions.\n", "  Substantial understanding of spin-orbit interactions in heavy-metal\n(HM)/ferromagnet (FM) heterostructures is crucial in developing spin-orbit\ntorque (SOT) spintronics devices utilizing spin Hall and Rashba effects. Though\nthe study of SOT effective fields dependence on the out-of-plane magnetization\nangle has been relatively extensive, the understanding of in-plane\nmagnetization angle dependence remains unknown. Here, we analytically propose a\nmethod to compute the SOT effective fields as a function of the in-plane\nmagnetization angle using harmonic Hall technique in perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy (PMA) structures. Two different samples with PMA,\nPt/Co/Pt/Co/Ta/BaTiO3 (BTO) test sample and Pt/Co/Pt/Co/Ta reference sample are\nstudied using the derived formula. Our measurements reveal that only the\ndampinglike field of the test sample with BTO capping layer exhibits an\nin-plane magnetization angle dependence while no angular dependence is found in\nthe reference sample. The presence of the BTO layer in the test sample, which\ngives rise to a Rashba effect at the interface, is ascribed as the source of\nthe angular dependence of the the dampinglike field.\n", "  We study the diffusive dynamics of a Brownian particle in proximity of a flat\nsurface under non-equilibrium conditions, which are created by an anisotropic\nthermal environment with different temperatures being active along distinct\nspatial directions. By presenting the exact time-dependent solution of the\nFokker-Planck equation for this problem, we demonstrate that the interplay\nbetween anisotropic diffusion and hard-core interaction with the plain wall\nrectifies the thermal fluctuations and induces directed particle transport\nparallel to the surface, without any deterministic forces being applied in that\ndirection. Based on current micromanipulation technologies, we suggest a\nconcrete experimental set-up to observe this novel noise-induced transport\nmechanism. We furthermore show that it is sensitive to particle\ncharacteristics, such that this set-up can be used for sorting particles of\ndifferent size.\n", "  We study the $s$-wave kaon-nucleon bound state with the strangeness $S=-1$ in\nthe Bethe-Salpeter formalism in the ladder and instantaneous approximations. We\nsolve the Bethe-Salpeter equation of the bound state and obtain the\nBethe-Salpeter amplitude. It is shown that the $K^-p$ bound state exists in\nthis formalism. We also study the decay width of the bound state based on the\nBethe-Salpeter techniques. The mass of this bound state is 1422 MeV and its\ndecay width is obviously smaller than that of $\\Lambda(1405)$. These results\nindicate that there may be some other structures in the observed resonance.\n", "  The spectrum of masses of the colorless (color neutral) states of the DW (De\nDonder-Weyl) Hamiltonian operator of quantum SU(2) Yang-Mills field theory on\n$\\mathbb{R}^D$ obtained via the precanonical quantization is shown to be purely\ndiscrete and bounded from below. The scale of the mass gap is estimated to be\nof the order of magnitude of the scale of the ultra-violet parameter\n$\\varkappa$ introduced by precanonical quantization on dimensional grounds.\n", "  The relative geodesic motion on $(1+3)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetimes\nis studied in terms of conserved quantities by adapting the Nachtmann boosting\nmethod created initially for the de Sitter spacetimes. In this approach the\nLorentzian isometriy is derived, relating the coordinates of the local chart of\na fixed observer with the coordinates of a mobile chart considered as the rest\nframe of a massive mobile object moving on a timelike anti-de Sitter geodesic.\nThe transformation of the conserved quantities is also investigated,\nconstructing thus a complete theory of the relative geodesic motion on anti-de\nSitter spacetimes. Some applications are discussed among them the problems of\ntwin paradox and Lorentz contraction are solved.\n", "  We study theoretically the Coulomb interaction between excitons in transition\nmetal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers. We calculate direct and exchange\ninteraction for both ground and excited states of excitons. The screening of\nthe Coulomb interaction, specific to monolayer structures, leads to the unique\nbehavior of the exciton-exciton scattering for excited states, characterized by\nthe non-monotonic dependence of the interaction as function of the transferred\nmomentum. We find that the nontrivial screening enables the description of TMD\nexciton interaction strength by approximate formula which includes exciton\nbinding parameters. The influence of screening and dielectric environment on\nthe exciton-exciton interaction was studied, showing qualitatively different\nbehavior for ground state and excited states of excitons. Furthermore, we\nconsider exciton-electron interaction, which for the excited states is governed\nby the dominant attractive contribution of the exchange component, which\nincreases with the excitation number. The results provide a quantitative\ndescription of the exciton-exciton and exciton-electron scattering in\ntransition metal dichalcogenides, and are of interest for the design of\nperspective nonlinear optical devices based on TMD monolayers.\n", "  We investigate the finite-temperature screening behavior of three-dimensional\nU(1) spin liquid phases with fracton excitations. Several features are shared\nwith the conventional U(1) spin liquid. The system can exhibit spin liquid\nphysics over macroscopic length scales at low temperatures, but screening\neffects eventually lead to a smooth finite-temperature crossover to a trivial\nphase at sufficiently large distances. However, unlike more conventional U(1)\nspin liquids, we find that complete low-temperature screening of fractons\nrequires not only very large distances, but also very long timescales. At the\nlongest timescales, a charged disturbance (fracton) will acquire a screening\ncloud of other fractons, resulting in only short-range correlations in the\nsystem. At intermediate timescales, on the other hand, a fracton can only be\npartially screened by a cloud of mobile excitations, leaving weak power-law\ncorrelations in the system. Such residual power-law correlations may be a\nuseful diagnostic in an experimental search for U(1) fracton phases.\n", "  A fly-by interaction has been suggested to be one of the major explanations\nfor enhanced star formation in blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, yet no direct\nevidence for this scenario has been found to date. In the HI Parkes all-sky\nsurvey (HIPASS), ESO 435-IG 020 and ESO 435- G 016, a BCD pair were found in a\ncommon, extended gas envelope of atomic hydrogen, providing an ideal case to\ntest the hypothesis that the starburst in BCDs can be indeed triggered by a\nfly-by interaction. Using high-resolution data from the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array (ATCA), we investigated HI properties and the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the BCD pair to study their interaction and star\nformation histories. The high-resolution HI data of both BCDs reveal a number\nof peculiarities, which are suggestive of tidal perturbation. Meanwhile, 40% of\nthe HIPASS flux is not accounted for in the ATCA observations with no HI gas\nbridge found between the two BCDs. Intriguingly, in the residual of the HIPASS\nand the ATCA data, 10% of the missing flux appears to be located between the\ntwo BCDs. While the SED-based age of the most dominant young stellar population\nis old enough to have originated from the interaction with any neighbors\n(including the other of the two BCDs), the most recent star formation activity\ntraced by strong H$\\alpha$ emission in ESO 435-IG 020 and the shear motion of\ngas in ESO 435- G 016, suggest a more recent or current tidal interaction.\nBased on these and the residual emission between the HIPASS and the ATCA data,\nwe propose an interaction between the two BCDs as the origin of their recently\nenhanced star formation activity. The shear motion on the gas disk, potentially\nwith re-accretion of the stripped gas, could be responsible for the active star\nformation in this BCD pair.\n", "  There have been a large number of papers on bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) over the\npast few years, trying to exploit its room-temperature magnetoelectric\nmultiferroic properties. Although these are attractive, BiFeO3 is not the ideal\nmultiferroic, due to weak magnetization and the difficulty in limiting leakage\ncurrents. Thus there is an ongoing search for alternatives, including such\nmaterials as gallium ferrite (GaFeO3). In the present work we report a\ncomprehensive study of the perovskite PbTi1-xPdxO3 with 0 < x < 0.3. Our study\nincludes dielectric, impedance and magnetization measurements, conductivity\nanalysis and study of crystallographic phases present in the samples with\nspecial attention paid to minor phases, identified as PdO, PbPdO2, and Pd3Pb.\nThe work is remarkable in two ways: Pd is difficult to substitute into ABO3\nperovskite oxides (where it might be useful for catalysis), and Pd is magnetic\nunder only unusual conditions (under strain or internal electric fields). The\nnew material, as a PZT derivative, is expected to have much stronger\npiezoelectric properties than BiFeO3.\n", "  In the last decade it has been shown that a large class of phase oscillator\nmodels admit low dimensional descriptions for the macroscopic system dynamics\nin the limit of an infinite number N of oscillators. The question of whether\nthe macroscopic dynamics of other similar systems also have a low dimensional\ndescription in the infinite N limit has, however, remained elusive. In this\npaper we show how techniques originally designed to analyze noisy experimental\nchaotic time series can be used to identify effective low dimensional\nmacroscopic descriptions from simulations with a finite number of elements. We\nillustrate and verify the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the\ndynamics of an ensemble of globally coupled Landau-Stuart oscillators for which\nwe demonstrate low dimensional macroscopic chaotic behavior with an effective\n4-dimensional description. By using this description we show that one can\ncalculate dynamical invariants such as Lyapunov exponents and attractor\ndimensions. One could also use the reconstruction to generate short-term\npredictions of the macroscopic dynamics.\n", "  A cylindrical GEM detector is under development, to serve as an upgraded\ninner tracker at the BESIII spectrometer. It will consist of three layers of\ncylindrically-shaped triple GEMs surrounding the interaction point. The\nexperiment is taking data at the e+e- collider BEPCII in Beijing (China) and\nthe GEM tracker will be installed in 2018. Tests on the performances of triple\nGEMs in strong magnetic field have been run by means of the muon beam available\nin the H4 line of SPS (CERN) with both planar chambers and the first\ncylindrical prototype. Efficiencies and resolutions have been evaluated using\ndifferent gains, gas mixtures, with and without magnetic field. The obtained\nefficiency is 97-98% on single coordinate view, in many operational\narrangements. The spatial resolution for planar GEMs has been evaluated with\ntwo different algorithms for the position determination: the charge centroid\nand the micro time projection chamber (mu-TPC) methods. The two modes are\ncomplementary and are able to cope with the asymmetry of the electron avalanche\nwhen running in magnetic field, and with non-orthogonal incident tracks. With\nthe charge centroid, a resolution lower than 100 micron has been reached\nwithout magnetic field and lower than 200 micron with a magnetic field up to 1\nT. The mu-TPC mode showed to be able to improve those results. In the first\nbeam test with the cylindrical prototype, the detector had a very good\nstability under different voltage configurations and particle intensities. The\nresolution evaluation is in progress.\n", "  The Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, with its experimental discovery in 2012,\nhas long been an interesting particle to study with the intention of exploring\nnew physics ideas beyond the SM (BSM). Its properties are still not well\nunderstood, and there are several features in LHC Run 1 and Run 2 data which\npoint at the possibility of extensions to the SM Higgs sector. This work\nexplores the Madala hypothesis, which is the introduction of a heavy scalar\n(the Madala boson) to the SM, in addition to a real scalar $S$ and dark matter\n(DM) candidate $\\chi$. This hypothesis has previously been used to explain\nseveral anomalous features observe in the LHC Run 1 data. This work extends the\nstudy to Run 2 data, and shows that the particle spectrum predicted in the\nMadala hypothesis is indeed compatible with LHC data. Further study prospects\nand striking signatures for searches are presented.\n", "  We compute universal distributions for the transition probabilities of a\nMarkov model for transport in the mixed phase space of area-preserving maps and\nverify that the survival probability distribution for trajectories near an\ninfinite island-around-island hierarchy exhibits, on average, a power law decay\nwith exponent $\\gamma = 1.57$. This exponent agrees with that found from\nsimulations of the H\\'enon and Chirikov-Taylor maps. This provides evidence\nthat the Meiss-Ott Markov tree model describes the transport for mixed systems.\n", "  We present a phase induced transparency based scheme to generate structured\nbeam patterns in a closed four level atomic system. We employ phase structured\nprobe beam and a transverse magnetic field (TMF) to create phase dependent\nmedium susceptibility. We show that such phase dependent modulation of\nabsorption holds the key to formation of a structured beam. We use a full\ndensity matrix formalism to explain the experiments of Radwell et al. [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 114,123603 (2015)] at weak probe limits. Our numerical results on\nbeam propagation confirms that the phase information present in the absorption\nprofile gets encoded on the spatial probe envelope which creates petal-like\nstructures even in the strong field limit. The contrast of the formed\nstructured beam can be enhanced by changing the strength of TMF as well as of\nthe probe intensity. In weak field limits an absorption profile is solely\nresponsible for creating a structured beam, whereas in the strong probe regime,\nboth dispersion and absorption profiles facilitate the generation of high\ncontrast structured beam. Furthermore we find the rotation of structured beams\nowing to strong field induced nonlinear magneto-optical rotation (NMOR).\n", "  Current experimental sensitivity on neutrino magnetic moments is many orders\nof magnitude above the Standard Model prediction. A potential measurement of\nnext-generation experiments would therefore strongly request new physics beyond\nthe Standard Model. However, large neutrino magnetic moments generically tend\nto induce large corrections to the neutrino masses and lead to fine-tuning. We\nshow that in a model where neutrino masses are proportional to neutrino\nmagnetic moments. We revisit, discuss and propose mechanisms that still provide\ntheoretical consistent explanations for a potential measurement of large\nneutrino magnetic moments. We find only two viable mechanisms to realize large\ntransition magnetic moments for Majorana neutrinos only.\n", "  We report on the fragmentation of the water molecule by $1$ MeV H$^{+}$,\nHe$^{+}$ and 650 keV N$^{+}$ ion impact. The fragment-ion energy spectra were\nmeasured by an electrostatic spectrometer at different observation angles. The\nobtained double-differential fragmentation cross sections for N$^{+}$ is found\nto be more than an order of magnitude higher, than that for H$^{+}$. The\nrelative ratios of the fragmentation channels are also different for the three\nprojectiles. Additional fragmentation channels were observed in the spectra for\nHe$^{+}$ and for N$^{+}$ impact, which are missing in the case of H$^{+}$. From\nthe analysis of the kinetic energy of the fragments, the maximum observed\ndegree of ionization was found to be $q\\rm{_{max}}=3$, $4$, and $5$ for\nH${^+}$, He${^+}$ and N${^+}$ impact, respectively. Absolute multiple\nionization cross sections have been determined. They are compared with the\npredictions of the classical trajectory Monte Carlo and\ncontinuum-distorted-wave eikonal-initial-state theories. At lower degrees of\nionization, theories provide reasonable agreement with experiment. The\nsystematic overestimation of the cross section by the theories towards higher\ndegrees of ionization indicates the failure of the independent particle model.\n", "  The Faint Infrared Grism Survey (FIGS) is a deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nWFC3/IR (Wide Field Camera 3 Infrared) slitless spectroscopic survey of four\ndeep fields. Two fields are located in the Great Observatories Origins Deep\nSurvey-North (GOODS-N) area and two fields are located in the Great\nObservatories Origins Deep Survey-South (GOODS-S) area. One of the southern\nfields selected is the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Each of these four fields were\nobserved using the WFC3/G102 grism (0.8$\\mu m$-1.15$\\mu m$ continuous coverage)\nwith a total exposure time of 40 orbits (~ 100 kilo-seconds) per field. This\nreaches a 3 sigma continuum depth of ~26 AB magnitudes and probes emission\nlines to $\\approx 10^{-17}\\ erg\\ s^{-1} \\ cm^{-2}$. This paper details the four\nFIGS fields and the overall observational strategy of the project. A detailed\ndescription of the Simulation Based Extraction (SBE) method used to extract and\ncombine over 10000 spectra of over 2000 distinct sources brighter than\nm_F105W=26.5 mag is provided. High fidelity simulations of the observations is\nshown to significantly improve the background subtraction process, the spectral\ncontamination estimates, and the final flux calibration. This allows for the\ncombination of multiple spectra to produce a final high quality, deep,\n1D-spectra for each object in the survey.\n", "  We perform a post-processing radiative feedback analysis on a 3D ab initio\ncosmological simulation of an atomic cooling halo under the direct collapse\nblack hole (DCBH) scenario. We maintain the spatial resolution of the\nsimulation by incorporating native ray-tracing on unstructured mesh data,\nincluding Monte Carlo Lyman-alpha (Ly{\\alpha}) radiative transfer. DCBHs are\nborn in gas-rich, metal-poor environments with the possibility of Compton-thick\nconditions, $N_H \\gtrsim 10^{24} {\\rm cm}^{-2}$. Therefore, the surrounding gas\nis capable of experiencing the full impact of the bottled-up radiation\npressure. In particular, we find that multiple scattering of Ly{\\alpha} photons\nprovides an important source of mechanical feedback after the gas in the\nsub-parsec region becomes partially ionized, avoiding the bottleneck of\ndestruction via the two-photon emission mechanism. We provide detailed\ndiscussion of the simulation environment, expansion of the ionization front,\nemission and escape of Ly{\\alpha} radiation, and Compton scattering. A sink\nparticle prescription allows us to extract approximate limits on the\npost-formation evolution of the radiative feedback. Fully coupled Ly{\\alpha}\nradiation hydrodynamics will be crucial to consider in future DCBH simulations.\n", "  By numerical integration, we study the relaxation dynamics of degenerate\nharmonic oscillator modes dispersively coupled to particle positions. Depending\non whether the effective inertial potential induced by the oscillators keep the\nparticles confined, or if the particle trajectories traverse the system, the\nlocal oscillator energy dissipation rate changes drastically. The inertial\ntrapping, release and retrapping of particles results in a characteristic\nstep-wise relaxation process, with alternating regions of fast and slow\ndissipation. To demonstrate this phenomenon we consider first a one-dimensional\nminimal prototype model which displays these characteristics. We then treat the\neffect of dispersive interaction in a model corresponding to an adsorbate\ndiffusing on a circular membrane interacting with its three lowest vibrational\nmodes. In the latter model, stepwise relaxation appears only in the presence of\nthermal noise, which also causes a slow-in-time stochastic precession of the\nmixing angle between the degenerate eigenmodes.\n", "  Analyzing quantum cosmological scenarios containing one scalar field with\nexponential potential, we have obtained a universe model which realizes a\nclassical dust contraction from very large scales, the initial repeller of the\nmodel, and moves to a stiff matter contraction near the singularity, which is\navoided due to a quantum bounce. The universe is then launched in a stiff\nmatter expanding phase, which then moves to a dark energy era, finally\nreturning to the dust expanding phase, the final attractor of the model. Hence\none has obtained a nonsingular cosmological model where a single scalar field\ncan describe both the matter contracting phase of a bouncing model, necessary\nto give an almost scale invariant spectrum of scalar cosmological\nperturbations, and a transient expanding dark energy phase. As the universe is\nnecessarily dust dominated in the far past, usual adiabatic vacuum initial\nconditions can be easily imposed in this era, avoiding the usual issues\nappearing when dark energy is considered in bouncing models.\n", "  We study the canonical description of the axisymmetric vacuum in 2+1\ndimensional gravity, treating Einstein's gravity as a Chern Simons gauge theory\non a manifold with the restriction that the dreibein is invertible. Our\ntreatment is in the spirit of Kucha\\v r's description of the Schwarzschild\nblack hole in 3+1 dimensions, where the mass and angular momentum are expressed\nin terms of the canonical variables and a series of canonical transformations\nare performed that turn the curvature coordinates and their conjugate momenta\ninto new canonical variables. In their final form, the constraints are seen to\nrequire that the momenta conjugate to the Killing time and curvature radius\nvanish and what remains are the mass, the angular momentum and their conjugate\nmomenta, which we derive. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation is trivial and describes\ntime independent systems with wave functions described only by the total mass\nand total angular momentum.\n", "  The characteristic profile and magnitude are predicted in theory for the\nneoclassical toroidal viscosity (NTV) torque induced by plasma response to the\nresonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) in a tokamak with an edge pedestal. For a\nlow-$\\beta$ equilibrium, the NTV torque is dominated by the toroidal component\nwith the same dominant toroidal mode number of RMP. The NTV torque profile is\nfound to be localized, whose peak location is determined by profiles of both\nthe equilibrium temperature (pressure) and the plasma response. In general, the\npeak of NTV torque profile is found to track the pedestal position. The\nmagnitude of NTV torque strongly depends on the $\\beta$ value of pedestal,\nwhich suggests a more significant role of NTV torque in higher plasma $\\beta$\nregimes. For a fixed plasma $\\beta$, decreasing density hence increasing\ntemperature can also enhance the amplitude of NTV torque due to the reduced\ncollisionality in the $1/\\nu$ regime. Based on those findings, we identify the\ntokamak operation regimes where the significance of NTV torque in edge pedestal\ninduced by RMP can approach those from other momentum sources such as the\nneutral beam injections.\n", "  Absorption of radiation by solution is described by the solution dielectric\nconstant and can be viewed as a specific application of the dielectric theory\nof solutions. For ideal solutions, the dielectric boundary value problem\nseparates the polar response into the polarization of the void in the liquid\ncreated by the solute and the response of the solute dipole. In the case of a\nprotein as a solute, its nuclear dynamics do not project on significant\nfluctuations of the dipole moment in the terahertz domain of frequencies and\nthe protein dipole can be viewed as dynamically frozen. Absorption of radiation\nthen reflects the interfacial polarization. Here we apply an analytical theory\nand computer simulation to absorption of radiation by ideal solutions of\nlysozyme. Comparison with experiment shows that Maxwell electrostatics fails to\ndescribe the polarization of the protein-water interface and the \"Lorentz\nvoid\", which does not anticipate polarization of the solute void by the\nexternal field (no surface charges), better represents the data. An analytical\ntheory for the slope of the solution absorption against the volume fraction of\nthe solute is formulated in terms of the cavity field response function. It is\ncalculated from molecular dynamics simulations in good agreement with\nexperiment. The protein hydration shell emerges as a separate sub-ensemble,\nwhich collectively is not described by the standard electrostatics of\ndielectrics.\n", "  Supernova neutrinos can exhibit a rich variety of flavor conversion\nmechanisms. In particular, they can experience \"fast\" self-induced flavor\nconversions almost immediately above the core. Very recently, a novel method\nhas been proposed to investigate these phenomena, in terms of the dispersion\nrelation for the complex frequency and wave number ($\\omega$,$k$) of\ndisturbances in the mean field of the $\\nu_e\\nu_x$ flavor coherence. We discuss\na systematic approach to such instabilities, originally developed in the\ncontext of plasma physics, and based of the time-asymptotic behavior of the\nGreen's function of the system. Instabilities are typically seen to emerge for\ncomplex $\\omega$, and can be further characterized as convective (moving away\nfaster than they spread) and absolute (growing locally), depending on\n$k$-dependent features. Stable cases emerge when $k$ (but not $\\omega$) is\ncomplex, leading to disturbances damped in space, or when both $\\omega$ and $k$\nare real, corresponding to complete stability. The analytical classification of\nboth unstable and stable modes leads not only to qualitative insights about\ntheir features but also to quantitative predictions about the growth rates of\ninstabilities. Representative numerical solutions are discussed in a simple\ntwo-beam model of interacting neutrinos. As an application, we argue that\nsupernova and binary neutron star mergers exhibiting a \"crossing\" in the\nelectron lepton number would lead to an absolute instability in the flavor\ncontent of the neutrino gas.\n", "  X-ray spectra of K-shell hollow krypton atoms produced in single collisions\nwith 52 - 197 MeV/u Xe54+ ions are measured in a heavy-ion storage ring\nequipped with an internal gas-jet target. Energy shifts of the K{\\alpha}_1,2^s,\nK{\\alpha}_1,2^(h,s), and K\\b{eta}_1,3^s transitions are obtained. Thus, the\naverage number of the spectator L-vacancies presented during the x-ray emission\nis deduced. From the relative intensities of the K{\\alpha}_1,2^s and\nK{\\alpha}_1,2^(h,s) transitions, the ratio of K-shell hollow krypton to singly\nK-shell ionized atoms is determined to be 14 - 24%. In the considered\ncollisions, the K-vacancies are mainly created by the direct ionization which\ncannot be calculated within the perturbation descriptions. The experimental\nresults are compared with a relativistic coupled channel calculation performed\nwithin the independent particle approximation.\n", "  An incoming electron is reflected back as a hole at a\nnormal-metal-superconductor interface, a process known as Andreev reflection.\nWe predict that there exists a universal transverse shift in this process due\nto the effect of spin-orbit coupling in the normal metal. Particularly, using\nboth the scattering approach and the argument of angular momentum conservation,\nwe demonstrate that the shifts are pronounced for lightly-doped Weyl\nsemimetals, and are opposite for incoming electrons with different chirality,\ngenerating a chirality-dependent Hall effect for the reflected holes. The\npredicted shift is not limited to Weyl systems, but exists for a general\nthree-dimensional spin-orbit- coupled metal interfaced with a superconductor.\n", "  We compile information from low-energy observables sensitive to\nflavor-conserving 4-fermion operators with two or four leptons. Our analysis\nincludes data from e+e- colliders, neutrino scattering on electron or nucleon\ntargets, atomic parity violation, parity-violating electron scattering, and the\ndecay of pions, neutrons, nuclei and tau leptons. We recast these data as\ntree-level constraints on 4-fermion operators in the Standard Model Effective\nField Theory (SMEFT) where the SM Lagrangian is extended by dimension-6\noperators. We allow all independent dimension-6 operators to be simultaneously\npresent with an arbitrary flavor structure. The results are presented as a\nmulti-dimensional likelihood function in the space of dimension-6 Wilson\ncoefficients, which retains information about the correlations. In this form,\nthe results can be readily used to place limits on masses and couplings in a\nlarge class of new physics theories.\n", "  Localized surface plasmons (LSP) in semiconductor particles are expected to\nexhibit spatial nonlocal response effects as the geometry enters the nanometer\nscale. To investigate these nonlocal effects, we apply the hydrodynamic model\nto nanospheres of two different semiconductor materials: intrinsic InSb and\n$n$-doped GaAs. Our results show that the semiconductors indeed display\nnonlocal effects, and that these effects are even more pronounced than in\nmetals. In a $150\\mathrm{\\,nm}$ InSb particle at $300\\mathrm{\\,K}$, the LSP\nfrequency is blueshifted 35%, which is orders of magnitude larger than the\nblueshift in a metal particle of the same size. This property, together with\ntheir tunability, makes semiconductors a promising platform for experiments in\nnonlocal effects.\n", "  We present a lattice determination of the $\\Lambda$ parameter in three-flavor\nQCD and the strong coupling at the Z pole mass. Computing the nonperturbative\nrunning of the coupling in the range from $0.2\\,$GeV to $70\\,$GeV, and using\nexperimental input values for the masses and decay constants of the pion and\nthe kaon, we obtain $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\rm MS}}^{(3)}=341(12)\\,$MeV. The\nnonperturbative running up to very high energies guarantees that systematic\neffects associated with perturbation theory are well under control. Using the\nfour-loop prediction for $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\rm\nMS}}^{(5)}/\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\rm MS}}^{(3)}$ yields\n$\\alpha^{(5)}_{\\overline{\\rm MS}}(m_{\\rm Z}) = 0.11852(84)$.\n", "  $\\omega$ Centauri (NGC~5139) contains many variable stars of different types,\nincluding the pulsating type II Cepheids, RR Lyrae and SX Phoenicis stars. We\ncarried out a deep, wide-field, near-infrared (IR) variability survey of\n$\\omega$ Cen, using the VISTA telescope. We assembled an unprecedented\nhomogeneous and complete $J$ and $K_{\\rm S}$ near-IR catalog of variable stars\nin the field of $\\omega$ Cen. In this paper we compare optical and near-IR\nlight curves of RR Lyrae stars, emphasizing the main differences. Moreover, we\ndiscuss the ability of near-IR observations to detect SX Phoenicis stars given\nthe fact that the amplitudes are much smaller in these bands compared to the\noptical. Finally, we consider the case in which all the pulsating stars in the\nthree different variability types follow a single period-luminosity relation in\nthe near-IR bands.\n", "  Controlling quantum systems is crucial for quantum computation and a variety\nof new quantum technologies. The control is typically achieved by breaking down\nthe target dynamics into a sequence of elementary gates,whose description can\nbe stored into the memory of a classical computer. Here we explore a different\napproach, initiated by Nielsen and Chuang, where the target dynamics is encoded\nin the state of a quantum system, regarded as a \"quantum program\". We show that\nquantum strategies based on coherent interactions between the quantum program\nand the target system offer an advantage over all classical strategies that\nmeasure the program and conditionally operate on the system. To certify the\nadvantage, we provide a benchmark that guarantees the successful demonstration\nof quantum-enhanced programming in realistic experiments.\n", "  We present the generalized quasiclassical theory of the long-range\nsuperconducting proximity effect in heterostructures with strong ferromagnets,\nwhere the exchange splitting is of the order of Fermi energy. In the\nferromagnet the propagation of spin-triplet Cooper pairs residing on the\nspin-split Fermi surfaces is shown to be governed by the spin-dependent Abelian\ngauge field which results either from the spin-orbital coupling or from the\nmagnetic texture. The additional gauge field enters into the quasiclassical\nequations in superposition with the usual electromagnetic vector potential and\nresults in the generation of spontaneous superconducting currents and phase\nshifts in various geometries which provide the sources of long-range\nspin-triplet correlations. We derive the Usadel equations and boundary\nconditions for the strong ferromagnet and consider several generic examples of\nthe Josephson systems supporting spontaneous currents.\n", "  We report a measurement of cross section $\\sigma(\\nu_{\\mu}+{\\rm\nnucleus}\\rightarrow\\mu^{-}+X)$ and the first measurements of the cross section\n$\\sigma(\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}+{\\rm nucleus}\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}+X)$ and their ratio\n$R(\\frac{\\sigma(\\bar \\nu)}{\\sigma(\\nu)})$ at (anti-)neutrino energies below 1.5\nGeV. We determine the single momentum bin cross section measurements, averaged\nover the T2K $\\bar{\\nu}/\\nu$-flux, for the detector target material (mainly\nCarbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen and Copper) with phase space restricted laboratory\nframe kinematics of $\\theta_{\\mu}<32^\\circ$ and $p_{\\mu}>$500 MeV/c.

A Fourier\nprojection of magnetization induced parallel to [001], made using the $hk0$\nreflections measured in 9~T, indicates that almost all of it is due to\nalignment of Ho moments. Further analysis of the asymmetries of general\nreflections in these data showed that although, at 70~K, 9~T applied parallel\nto [001] hardly perturbs the antiferromagnetic order of the Fe sublattices, it\ninduces significant antiferromagnetic order of the Ho sublattices in the\n$x\\mhyphen y$ plane, with the antiferromagnetic components of moment having the\nsame order of magnitude as the induced ferromagnetic ones. Strong intensity\nasymmetries measured in the low temperature $\\Gamma_2$ structure with a lower\nfield, 0.5 T $\\parallel$ [100] allowed the variation of the ordered components\nof the Ho and Fe moments to be followed. Their absolute orientations, in the\n180\\degree\\ domain stabilised by the field were determined relative to the\ndistorted perovskite structure,. This relationship fixes the sign of the\nDzyalshinski-Moriya (D-M) interaction which leads to the weak ferromagnetism.\nOur results indicate that the combination of strong y-axis anisotropy of the Ho\nmoments and Ho-Fe exchange interactions breaks the centrosymmetry of the\nstructure and could lead to ferroelectric polarization.\n", "  We present new experiments to study the formation of radiative shocks and the\ninteraction between two counter-propagating radiative shocks. The experiments\nwere performed at the Orion laser facility which was used to drive shocks in\nxenon inside large aspect ratio gas-cells. The collision between the two shocks\nand their respective radiative precursors, combined with the formation of\ninherently 3-dimensional shocks, provides a novel platform particularly suited\nfor benchmarking of numerical codes. The dynamics of the shocks before and\nafter the collision were investigated using point-projection X-ray backlighting\nwhile, simultaneously, the electron density in the radiative precursor was\nmeasured via optical laser interferometry. Modelling of the experiments using\nthe 2-D radiation hydrodynamic codes NYM/PETRA show a very good agreement with\nthe experimental results.\n", "  Comment on \"Dependency distance: a new perspective on syntactic patterns in\nnatural language\" by Haitao Liu et al\n", "  Recently the CIBER experiment measured the diffuse cosmic infrared background\n(CIB) flux and claimed an excess compared with integrated emission from\ngalaxies. We show that the CIB spectrum can be fitted by the additional photons\nproduced by the decay of a new particle. However, it also contributes too much\nto the anisotropy of the CIB, which is in contradiction with the anisotropy\nmeasurements by the CIBER and Hubble Space Telescope.\n", "  The dynamics of thermal and non-thermal lattice deformation of nanometer\nthick polycrystalline aluminum film has been studied by means of femtosecond\n(fs) time-resolved electron diffraction. We utilized two different pump\nwavelengths: 800 nm, the fundamental of Ti: sapphire laser and 1250 nm\ngenerated by a home-made optical parametric amplifier(OPA). Our data show that,\nalthough coherent phonons were generated under both conditions, the diffraction\nintensity decayed with the characteristic time of 0.9+/-0.3 ps and 1.7+/-0.3 ps\nunder 800 nm and 1250 nm excitation, respectively. Because the 800 nm laser\nexcitation corresponds to the strong interband transition of aluminum due to\nthe 1.55 eV parallel band structure, our experimental data indicate the\npresence of non-thermal lattice deformation under 800 nm excitation, which\noccurs on a time-scale that is shorter than the thermal processes dominated by\nelectron-phonon coupling under 1250 nm excitation.\n", "  We construct N=2 four and five-dimensional supergravity theories coupled to\nvector multiplets in various space-time signatures (t,s), where t and s refer,\nrespectively, to the number of time and spatial dimensions. The\nfive-dimensional supergravity theories, t+s=5, are constructed by investigating\nthe integrability conditions arising from Killing spinor equations. The\nfive-dimensional supergravity theories can also be obtained by reducing Hull's\neleven-dimensional supergravities on a Calabi-Yau threefold. The dimensional\nreductions of the five-dimensional supergravities on space and time-like\ncircles produce N=2 four-dimensional supergravity theories with signatures\n(t-1,s) and (t,s-1) exhibiting projective special (para)-K\\\"ahler geometry.\n", "  Exchange coupling between magnetic grains is essential for maintaining the\nstability of stored information in magnetic recording media. Using an atomistic\nspin model, we have investigated the coupling between neighbouring magnetic\ngrains where magnetic impurity atoms have migrated into the non-magnetic grain\nboundary. We find that when the impurity density is low a biquadratic term in\naddition to the bilinear term is required to properly describe the\ninter-granular exchange coupling. The temperature dependence both terms is\nfound to follow a power law behaviour with the biquadratic exchange constant\ndecaying faster than the bilinear. For increasing grain boundary thickness the\ninter-granular exchange is lower and decays faster with temperature. Further\nsimulations of a grain at a bit boundary show an unexpected energy minimum for\nin-plane magnetisation which can only be reproduced using a biquadratic\nexchange term.\n", "  We make an attempt to map the integrable boundary conditions for 2\ndimensional non-linear O(N) $\\sigma$-models. We do it at various levels:\nclassically, by demanding the existence of infinitely many conserved local\ncharges and also by constructing the double row transfer matrix from the Lax\nconnection, which leads to the spectral curve formulation of the problem; at\nthe quantum level, we describe the solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter\nequation and derive the Bethe-Yang equations. We then show how to connect the\nthermodynamic limit of the boundary Bethe-Yang equations to the spectral curve.\n", "  Context. CEMP-no stars are long-lived low-mass stars with a very low iron\ncontent, overabundances of carbon and no or minor signs for the presence of s-\nor r-elements. Although their origin is still a matter of debate, they are\noften considered as being made of a material ejected by a previous stellar\ngeneration (source stars). Aims. We place constraints on the source stars from\nthe observed abundance data of CEMP-no stars. Methods. We computed source star\nmodels of 20, 32, and 60 M$_{\\odot}$ at Z = 10$^{-5}$ with and without fast\nrotation. For each model we also computed a case with a late mixing event\noccurring between the hydrogen and helium-burning shell $\\sim$ 200 yr before\nthe end of the evolution. This creates a partially CNO-processed zone in the\nsource star. We use the 12C/13C and C/N ratios observed on CEMP-no stars to put\nconstraints on the possible source stars (mass, late mixing or not). Then, we\ninspect more closely the abundance data of six CEMP-no stars and select their\npreferred source star(s). Results. Four out of the six CEMP-no stars studied\ncannot be explained without the late mixing process in the source star. Two of\nthem show nucleosynthetic signatures of a progressive mixing (due e.g. to\nrotation) in the source star. We also show that a 20 M$_{\\odot}$ source star is\npreferred compared to one of 60 M$_{\\odot}$ and that likely only the outer\nlayers of the source stars were expelled to reproduce the observed 12C/13C.\nConclusions. The results suggest that (1) a late mixing process could operate\nin some source stars, (2) a progressive mixing, possibly achieved by fast\nrotation, is at work in several source stars, (3) $\\sim$ 20 M$_{\\odot}$ source\nstars are preferred compared to $\\sim$ 60 M$_{\\odot}$ ones, and (4) the source\nstar might have preferentially experienced a low energetic supernova with large\nfallback.\n", "  We demonstrate that spin supercurrents are conserved upon transmission\nthrough a conventional superconductor, even in the presence of spin-dependent\nscattering by impurities with magnetic moments or spin-orbit coupling. This is\nfundamentally different from conventional spin currents, which decay in the\npresence of such scattering, and this has important implications for the usage\nof superconducting materials in spintronic hybrid structures.\n", "  The absence of inversion symmetry leads to a strong spin-orbit splitting of\nthe upper valence band of semiconducting single layer transition metal\ndichalchogenides such as MoS$_2$ or WS$_2$. This permits a direct comparison of\nthe electron-phonon coupling strength in states that only differ by their spin.\nHere, the electron-phonon coupling in the valence band maximum of single-layer\nWS$_2$ is studied by first principles calculations and angle-resolved\nphotoemission. The coupling strength is found to be drastically different for\nthe two spin-split branches, with calculated values of $\\lambda_K=$0.0021 and\n0.40 for the upper and lower spin-split valence band of the free-standing\nlayer, respectively. This difference is somewhat reduced when including\nscattering processes involving the Au(111) substrate present in the experiment\nand the experimental results confirm the strongly branch-dependent coupling\nstrength.\n", "  We present multi-wavelength scatter broadening observations of 47 pulsars,\nmade with the Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope (GMRT), Ooty Radio Telescope\n(ORT) and Long Wavelength Array (LWA). The GMRT observations have been made in\nthe phased array mode at 148, 234, and 610 MHz and the ORT observations at 327\nMHz. The LWA data sets have been obtained from the LWA pulsar data archive. The\nbroadening of each pulsar as a function of observing frequency provides the\nfrequency scaling index, $\\alpha$. The estimations of $\\alpha$ have been\nobtained for 39 pulsars, which include entirely new estimates for 31 pulsars.\nThis study increases the total sample of pulsars available with $\\alpha$\nestimates by $\\sim$50\\%. The overall distribution of $\\alpha$ with the\ndispersion measure (DM) of pulsar shows interesting variations, which are\nconsistent with the earlier studies. However, for a given value of DM a range\nof $\\alpha$ values are observed, indicating the characteristic turbulence along\neach line of sight. For each pulsar, the estimated level of turbulence,\n$C^{2}_{n_e}$, has also been compared with $\\alpha$ and DM. Additionally, we\ncompare the distribution of $\\alpha$ with the theoretically predicated model to\ninfer the general characteristics of the ionized interstellar medium (ISM).\nNearly 65\\% of the pulsars show a flatter index (i.e., $\\alpha < 4.4$) than\nthat is expected from the Kolmogorov turbulence model. Moreover, the group of\npulsars having flatter index is typically associated with an enhanced value of\n$C^{2}_{n_e}$ than those with steeper index.\n", "  Assuming that high energy effects may alter the standard dispersion relations\ngoverning quantized fields, the influence of such modifications on various\nphenomena has been studied extensively in the literature. In different\ncontexts, it has generally been found that, while super-luminal dispersion\nrelations hardly affect the standard results, sub-luminal relations can lead to\n(even substantial) modifications to the conventional results. A polymer\nquantized scalar field is characterized by a series of modified dispersion\nrelations along with suitable changes to the standard measure of the density of\nmodes. Amongst the modified dispersion relations, one finds that the lowest in\nthe series can behave sub-luminally over a small domain in wavenumbers. In this\nwork, we study the response of a uniformly rotating Unruh-DeWitt detector that\nis coupled to a polymer quantized scalar field. While certain sub-luminal\ndispersion relations can alter the response of the rotating detector\nconsiderably, in the case of polymer quantization, due to the specific nature\nof the dispersion relations, the modification to the transition probability\nrate of the detector does not prove to be substantial. We discuss the wider\nimplications of the result.\n", "  We present resistance versus temperature data for a series of boron-doped\nnanocrystalline diamond films whose grain size is varied by changing the film\nthickness. Upon extracting the fluctuation conductivity near to the critical\ntemperature we observe three distinct scaling regions -- 3D intragrain,\nquasi-0D, and 3D intergrain -- in confirmation of the prediction of Lerner,\nVarlamov and Vinokur. The location of the dimensional crossovers between these\nscaling regions allows us to determine the tunnelling energy and the Thouless\nenergy for each film. This is a demonstration of the use of \\emph{fluctuation\nspectroscopy} to determine the properties of a superconducting granular system.\n", "  Polymer properties are inherently multi-scale in nature, where delicate local\ninteraction details play a key role in describing their global conformational\nbehavior. In this context, deriving coarse-grained (CG) multi-scale models for\npolymeric liquids is a non-trivial task. Further complexities arise when\ndealing with copolymer systems with varying microscopic sequences, especially\nwhen they are of an amphiphilic nature. In this work, we derive a segment-based\ngeneric CG model for amphiphilic copolymers consisting of repeat units of\nhydrophobic (methylene) and hydrophilic (ethylene oxide) monomers. The system\nis a simulation analogue of polyacetal copolymers [Samanta et al.,\nMacromolecules 49, 1858 (2016)]. The CG model is found to be transferable over\na wide range of copolymer sequences and also to be consistent with existing\nexperimental data.\n", "  We describe a method to determine whether a material has isomorphs in its\nthermodynamic phase diagram. Isomorphs are state points for which various\nproperties are invariant in reduced units. Such materials are commonly\nidentified from strong correlation between thermal fluctuations of the\npotential energy, U, and the virial W, but this identification is not generally\napplicable to real materials. We show from molecular dynamic simulations of\natomic, molecular, and polymeric materials that systems with strong U-W\ncorrelation cannot be pressure densified; that is, the density obtained on\ncooling to the glassy state and releasing the pressure is independent of the\npressure applied during cooling.\n", "  The Neutrino Experiment with a Xenon Time-Projection Chamber (NEXT)\nexperiment intends to investigate the neutrinoless double beta decay of 136Xe,\nand therefore requires a severe suppression of potential backgrounds. An\nextensive material screening and selection process was undertaken to quantify\nthe radioactivity of the materials used in the experiment. Separate energy and\ntracking readout planes using different sensors allow us to combine the\nmeasurement of the topological signature of the event for background\ndiscrimination with the energy resolution optimization. The design of radiopure\nreadout planes, in direct contact with the gas detector medium, was especially\nchallenging since the required components typically have activities too large\nfor experiments demanding ultra-low background conditions. After studying the\ntracking plane, here the radiopurity control of the energy plane is presented,\nmainly based on gamma-ray spectroscopy using ultra-low background germanium\ndetectors at the Laboratorio Subterr\\'aneo de Canfranc (Spain). All the\navailable units of the selected model of photomultiplier have been screened\ntogether with most of the components for the bases, enclosures and windows.\nAccording to these results for the activity of the relevant radioisotopes, the\nselected components of the energy plane would give a contribution to the\noverall background level in the region of interest of at most 2.4 x 10-4 counts\nkeV-1 kg-1 y-1, satisfying the sensitivity requirements of the NEXT experiment.\n", "  Recent cosmological measurements tend to confirm that the fine structure\nconstant {\\alpha} is not immutable and has undergone a tiny variation since the\nBig Bang. Choosing adequate units, this could also reflect a variation of\nPlanck's constant h. The aim of this Letter is to explore some consequences of\nsuch a possible change of h for the pure and mixed states of quantum mechanics.\nSurprisingly enough it is found that not only is the purity of a state\nextremely sensitive to such changes, but that quantum states can evolve into\nclassical states, and vice versa. A complete classification of such transitions\nis however not possible for the moment being because of yet unsolved\nmathematical difficulties related to the study of positivity properties of\ntrace class operators.\n", "  We show how any flavour conserving $Z'$ model can be made flavour violating\nand non-universal by introducing mass mixing of quarks and leptons with a\nfourth family of vector-like fermions with non-universal $Z'$ couplings. After\ndeveloping a general formalism, we focus on two concrete examples, namely a\nfermiophobic model, and an $SO(10)$ GUT model, and show how they can account\nfor the anomalous $B$ decay ratios $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$. A similar analysis\ncould be performed for $B-L$ models, $E_6$ models, composite models, and so on.\n", "  We present a condition in which the dimer-monomer state is exactly the ground\nstate of an extended diamond chain with spin magnitude 1/2. The Hamiltonian of\nthe extended diamond chain includes next-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions\nand distortions, where the spin magnitude of the spin pair on a singlet dimer\nis not generally conserved. The method of deriving the condition is based on\nrepresenting the Hamiltonian in a complete square form. The dimer-monomer\nground state is found even if the Hamiltonian has no space-reflection\nsymmetries.\n", "  We present the highest sensitivity and angular resolution study at 0.32 GHz\nof the dwarf irregular galaxy IC\\,10, observed using the Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope, probing $\\sim45$ pc spatial scales. We find the galaxy-averaged\nradio continuum spectrum to be relatively flat, with a spectral index $\\alpha =\n-0.34\\pm0.01$ ($S_\\nu \\propto \\nu^\\alpha$), mainly due to a high contribution\nfrom free--free emission. At 0.32 GHz, some of the H{\\sc ii} regions show\nevidence of free--free absorption as they become optically thick below\n$\\sim0.41$ GHz with corresponding free electron densities of $\\sim11-22~\\rm\ncm^{-3}$. After removing the free--free emission, we studied the\nradio--infrared relations on 55, 110 and 165 pc spatial scales. We find that on\nall scales the non-thermal emission at 0.32 and 6.2 GHz correlates better with\nfar-infrared (FIR) emission at $70\\,\\mu$m than mid-infrared emission at\n$24\\,\\mu$m. The dispersion of the radio--FIR relation arises due to variations\nin both magnetic field and dust temperature, and decreases systematically with\nincreasing spatial scale. The effect of cosmic ray transport is negligible as\ncosmic ray electrons were only injected $\\lesssim5$ Myr ago. The average\nmagnetic field strength ($B$) of $12~\\mu$G in the disc is comparable to that of\nlarge star-forming galaxies. The local magnetic field is strongly correlated\nwith local star formation rate ($\\mathrm{SFR}$) as $B \\propto\n\\mathrm{SFR}^{0.35\\pm0.03}$, indicating a star-burst driven fluctuation dynamo\nto be efficient ($\\sim10$ per cent) in amplifying the field in IC\\,10. The high\nspatial resolution observations presented here suggest that the high efficiency\nof magnetic field amplification and strong coupling with SFR likely sets up the\nradio--FIR correlation in cosmologically young galaxies.\n", "  A new perspective on the classical mechanical formulation of particle\ntrajectories in lorentz-violating theories is presented. Using the extended\nhamiltonian formalism, a Legendre Transformation between the associated\ncovariant Lagrangian and Hamiltonian varieties is constructed. This approach\nenables calculation of trajectories using hamilton's equations in momentum\nspace and the Euler-Lagrange equations in velocity space away from certain\nsingular points that arise in the theory. Singular points are naturally\nde-singularized by requiring the trajectories to be smooth functions of both\nvelocity and momentum variables. In addition, it is possible to identify\nspecific sheets of the dispersion relations that correspond to specific\nsolutions for the lagrangian. Examples corresponding to bipartite Finsler\nfunctions are computed in detail. A direct connection between the lagrangians\nand the field-theoretic solutions to the Dirac equation is also established for\na special case.\n", "  In this paper we study the diffusely observed occurrence of Fractality and\nSelf-organized Criticality in mechanical systems. We analytically show, based\non a prototypical compressed tensegrity structure, that these phenomena can be\nviewed as the result of the contemporary attainment of mass minimization and\nglobal stability in elastic systems.\n", "  Main Belt Comets are a recently identified population of minor bodies with\nstable asteroid-like orbits but cometary appearances. Sublimation of water ice\nis the most likely mechanism for their recurrent activity (i.e. dust tails and\ndust comae), although there has been no direct detection of gas. These peculiar\nobjects could hold the key to the origin of water on Earth. In this paper we\npresent a search for the gas responsible for lifting dust from P/2012 T1\n(Pan-STARRS), and review previous attempts at such measurements. To date such\nsearches have mainly been indirect, looking for the common cometary gas CN\nrather than gasses related to water itself. We use the VLT and X-shooter to\nsearch for emission from OH in the UV, a direct dissociation product of water.\nWe do not detect any emission lines, and place an upper limit on water\nproduction rate from P/2012 T1 of $8-9\\times10^{25}$ molecules s$^{-1}$. This\nis similar to limits derived from observations using the Herschel space\ntelescope. We conclude that the best current facilities are incapable of\ndetecting water emission at the exceptionally low levels required to produce\nthe observed activity in Main Belt Comets.\n", "  The measured orbital period decay of compact-star binaries, with\ncharacteristic orbital periods $\\sim 0.1$~days, is explained with very high\nprecision by the gravitational wave (GW) emission of an inspiraling binary in\nvacuum. However, the binary gravitational binding energy is also affected by an\nusually neglected phenomenon, namely the dark matter dynamical friction (DMDF)\nproduced by the interaction of the binary components with their respective DM\ngravitational wakes. The entity of this effect depends on the orbital period\nand on the local value of the DM density, hence on the position of the binary\nin the Galaxy. We evaluate the DMDF produced by three different DM profiles:\nthe Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), the non-singular-isothermal-sphere (NSIS) and\nthe Ruffini-Arg\\\"uelles-Rueda (RAR) profile based on self-gravitating keV\nfermions. We first show that indeed, due to their Galactic position, the GW\nemission dominates over the DMDF in the NS-NS, NS-WD and WD-WD binaries for\nwhich measurements of the orbital decay exist. Then, we evaluate the conditions\nunder which the effect of DMDF on the binary evolution becomes comparable to,\nor overcomes, the one of the GW emission. We find that, for instance for\n$1.3$--$0.2$ $M_\\odot$ NS-WD, $1.3$--$1.3$~$M_\\odot$ NS-NS, and\n$0.25$--$0.50$~$M_\\odot$ WD-WD, located at 0.1~kpc, this occurs at orbital\nperiods around 20--30 days in a NFW profile while, in a RAR profile, it occurs\nat about 100 days. For closer distances to the Galactic center, the DMDF effect\nincreases and the above critical orbital periods become interestingly shorter.\nFinally, we also analyze the system parameters for which DMDF leads to an\norbital widening instead of orbital decay. All the above imply that a\ndirect/indirect observational verification of this effect in compact-star\nbinaries might put strong constraints on the nature of DM and its Galactic\ndistribution.\n", "  By virtue of the KP hierarchy reduction technique, we construct the general\nbright-dark mixed $N$-soliton solution to the multi-component Mel'nikov system\ncomprised of multiple (say $M$) short-wave components and one long-wave\ncomponent with all possible combinations of nonlinearities including\nall-positive, all-negative and mixed types. Firstly, the two-bright-one-dark\n(2-b-1-d) and one-bright-two-dark (1-b-2-d) mixed $N$-soliton solutions in\nshort-wave components of the three-component Mel'nikov system are derived in\ndetail. Then we extend our analysis to the $M$-component Mel'nikov system to\nobtain its general mixed $N$-soliton solution. The formula obtained unifies the\nall-bright, all-dark and bright-dark mixed $N$-soliton solutions. For the\ncollision of two solitons, the asymptotic analysis shows that for a\n$M$-component Mel'nikov system with $M \\geq 3$, inelastic collision takes\nplace, resulting in energy exchange among the short-wave components supporting\nbright solitons only if the bright solitons appear at least in two short-wave\ncomponents. Whereas, the dark solitons in the short-wave components and the\nbright solitons in the long-wave component always undergo elastic collision\nwhich just accompanied by a position shift.\n", "  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has allowed us to increase the number of known\nwhite dwarfs by a factor of five and consequently the number of known pulsating\nwhite dwarfs also by a factor of five. It has also led to the discovery of new\ntypes of variable white dwarfs, as the variable hot DQs, and the pulsating\nExtremely Low Mass white dwarfs. With the Kepler Mission, it has been possible\nto discover new phenomena, the outbursts present in a few pulsating white\ndwarfs.\n", "  We study possible applications of artificial neural networks to examine the\nstring landscape. Since the field of application is rather versatile, we\npropose to dynamically evolve these networks via genetic algorithms. This means\nthat we start from basic building blocks and combine them such that the neural\nnetwork performs best for the application we are interested in. We study three\nareas in which neural networks can be applied: to classify models according to\na fixed set of (physically) appealing features, to find a concrete realization\nfor a computation for which the precise algorithm is known in principle but\nvery tedious to actually implement, and to predict or approximate the outcome\nof some involved mathematical computation which performs too inefficient to\napply it, e.g. in model scans within the string landscape. We present simple\nexamples that arise in string phenomenology for all three types of problems and\ndiscuss how they can be addressed by evolving neural networks from genetic\nalgorithms.\n", "  We present NNFF1.0, a new determination of the fragmentation functions (FFs)\nof charged pions, charged kaons, and protons/antiprotons from an analysis of\nsingle-inclusive hadron production data in electron-positron annihilation. This\ndetermination, performed at leading, next-to-leading, and\nnext-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD, is based on the NNPDF\nmethodology, a fitting framework designed to provide a statistically sound\nrepresentation of FF uncertainties and to minimise any procedural bias. We\ndiscuss novel aspects of the methodology used in this analysis, namely an\noptimised parametrisation of FFs and a more efficient $\\chi^2$ minimisation\nstrategy, and validate the FF fitting procedure by means of closure tests. We\nthen present the NNFF1.0 sets, and discuss their fit quality, their\nperturbative convergence, and their stability upon variations of the kinematic\ncuts and the fitted dataset. We find that the systematic inclusion of\nhigher-order QCD corrections significantly improves the description of the\ndata, especially in the small-$z$ region. We compare the NNFF1.0 sets to other\nrecent sets of FFs, finding in general a reasonable agreement, but also\nimportant differences. Together with existing sets of unpolarised and polarised\nparton distribution functions (PDFs), FFs and PDFs are now available from a\ncommon fitting framework for the first time.\n", "  We image 104 newly identified low-mass (mostly M-dwarf) pre-main sequence\nmembers of nearby young moving groups with Magellan Adaptive Optics (MagAO) and\nidentify 27 binaries with instantaneous projected separation as small as 40\nmas. 15 were previously unknown. The total number of multiple systems in this\nsample including spectroscopic and visual binaries from the literature is 36,\ngiving a raw multiplicity rate of at least $35^{+5}_{-4}\\%$ for this\npopulation. In the separation range of roughly 1 - 300 AU in which infrared AO\nimaging is most sensitive, the raw multiplicity rate is at least\n$24^{+5}_{-4}\\%$ for binaries resolved by the MagAO infrared camera (Clio). The\nM-star sub-sample of 87 stars yields a raw multiplicity of at least\n$30^{+5}_{-4}\\%$ over all separations, $21^{+5}_{-4}\\%$ for secondary\ncompanions resolved by Clio from 1 to 300 AU ($23^{+5}_{-4}\\%$ for all known\nbinaries in this separation range). A combined analysis with binaries\ndiscovered by the Search for Associations Containing Young stars shows that\nmultiplicity fraction as a function of mass and age over the range of 0.2 to\n1.2 $M_\\odot$ and 10 - 200 Myr appears to be linearly flat in both parameters\nand across YMGs. This suggests that multiplicity rates are largely set by 100\nMyr without appreciable evolution thereafter. After bias corrections are\napplied, the multiplicity fraction of low-mass YMG members ($< 0.6 M_\\odot$) is\nin excess of the field.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of overcharging spherically-symmetric black\nholes in spacetime dimensions $D > 4$ by the capture of a charged particle. We\ngeneralize Wald's classic result that extremal black holes cannot be\novercharged. For nearly extremal black holes, we also generalize Hubeny's\nscenario by showing that overcharging is possible in a small region of\nparameter space. We check how $D$ affects the overcharging parameter space, and\nfind that overcharging becomes increasingly difficult for nearly-extremal black\nholes in the large-$D$ limit.\n", "  IGR J16318-4848 is an X-ray binary with the highest known line of sight\nabsorption column density among all known X-ray binary systems in our galaxy.\nIn order to investigate the reason behind such a large absorption column, we\nlooked at the variations in the X-ray intensity and spectral parameters as a\nfunction of the tentatively discovered $\\sim$ 80 day orbit of this source. The\norbital period is firmly confirmed in the long term ($\\sim$ 12 year) Swift BAT\nlightcurve. Two peaks about half an orbit apart, one narrow and small, and the\nother broad and large are seen in the orbital intensity profile. We find that\nwhile most orbits show enhanced emissions at these two peaks, the larger peak\nin the folded longterm lightcurve is more a result of randomly occurring large\nflares spread over $\\sim$ 0.2 orbital phase. As opposed to this, the smaller\npeak is seen in every orbit as a regular increase in intensity. Using archival\ndata spread over different phases of the orbit and the geometry of the system\nas known from previously published infrared observations, we present a possible\nscenario which explains the orbital intensity profile, bursting characteristics\nand large column density of this X-ray binary.\n", "  We study laser-assisted photodetachment time delays by attosecond pulse\ntrains from the closed-shell negative ions F- and Cl-. We investigate the\nseparability of the delay into two contributions: (i) the Wigner-like delay\nassociated with one-photon ionization by the attosecond pulse train and (ii)\nthe delay associated with exchange of an additional laser photon in the\npresence of the potential of the remaining target. Based on the asymptotic form\nof the wave packet, the latter term is expected to be negligible because the\nion is neutralized leading to a vanishing laser-ion interaction with increasing\nelectron-atom separation. While this asymptotic behavior is verified at high\nphotoelectron energies, we also quantify sharp deviations at low photoelectron\nenergies. Further, these low-energy delays are clearly different for the two\nstudied anions indicating a breakdown of the universality of laser-ion induced\ndelays. The fact that the short-range potential can induce a delay of as much\nas 50 as can have implications for the interpretation of delay measurements\nalso in other systems that lack long-range potential.\n", "  We present an upgraded calculation of the effects of resonance-continuum\ninterference for the Higgs boson decaying to two photons at the Large Hadron\nCollider, at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling $\\alpha_S$,\n$O(\\alpha_S^3)$, and including transverse-momentum ($q_T$) resummation at\nnext-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We study the importance of the\ninterference contribution in different transverse-momentum regions, with a\nparticular focus on the low $q_T$ region $q_T^2 << Q^2$ (with $Q^2$ being the\ninvariant diphoton mass) where resummation becomes essential for a reliable\ncalculation.\n", "  Ladder operators can be useful constructs, allowing for unique insight and\nintuition. In fact, they have played a special role in the development of\nquantum mechanics and field theory. Here, we introduce a novel type of ladder\noperators, which map a scalar field onto another massive scalar field. We\nconstruct such operators, in arbitrary dimensions, from closed conformal\nKilling vector fields, eigenvectors of the Ricci tensor. As an example, we\nexplicitly construct these objects in anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS) and show\nthat they exist for masses above the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound.\nStarting from a regular seed solution of the massive Klein-Gordon equation\n(KGE), mass ladder operators in AdS allow one to build a variety of regular\nsolutions with varying boundary condition at spatial infinity. We also discuss\nmass ladder operator in the context of spherical harmonics, and the relation\nbetween supersymmetric quantum mechanics and so-called Aretakis constants in an\nextremal black hole.\n", "  The combination of elliptical deformation of streamlines and vorticity can\nlead to the destabilisation of any rotating flow via the elliptical\ninstability. Such a mechanism has been invoked as a possible source of\nturbulence in planetary cores subject to tidal deformations. The saturation of\nthe elliptical instability has been shown to generate turbulence composed of\nnon-linearly interacting waves and strong columnar vortices with varying\nrespective amplitudes, depending on the control parameters and geometry. In\nthis paper, we present a suite of numerical simulations to investigate the\nsaturation and the transition from vortex-dominated to wave-dominated regimes.\nThis is achieved by simulating the growth and saturation of the elliptical\ninstability in an idealised triply periodic domain, adding a frictional damping\nto the geostrophic component only, to mimic its interaction with boundaries. We\nreproduce several experimental observations within one idealised local model\nand complement them by reaching more extreme flow parameters. In particular, a\nwave-dominated regime that exhibits many signatures of inertial wave turbulence\nis characterised for the first time. This regime is expected in planetary\ninteriors.\n", "  In recent years, the viability of the pair-instability supernova (PISN)\nscenario for explaining superluminous supernovae has all but disappeared except\nfor a few slowly-evolving examples. However, PISN are not predicted to be\nsuperluminous throughout the bulk of their mass range. In fact, it is more\nlikely that the first PISN we see (if we have not seen one already) will not be\nsuperluminous. Here, we present hydrodynamic simulations of PISNe for four\nstellar models with unique envelope properties spanning the PISN mass range. In\naddition, we compute synthetic light curves for comparison with current and\nfuture observations. We also investigate, in the context of our most massive\nmodel, the prospect of mixing in the supernova ejecta alleviating discrepancies\nbetween current PISN models and the remaining superluminous candidate events.\nTo this end, we present the first published 3D hydrodynamic simulations of\nPISNe. After achieving convergence between 1D, 2D, and 3D simulations we\nexamine mixing in the supernova ejecta and its affect on the bolometric light\ncurve. We observe slight deviations from spherical symmetry which increase with\nthe number of dimensions. We find no significant effects on the bolometric\nlight curve, however we conclude that mixing between the silicon and oxygen\nrich layers caused by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability may affect spectra.\n", "  We present measurements of relativistic scaling relations in\n$(2+1)$-dimensional conformal fluid turbulence from direct numerical\nsimulations, in the weakly compressible regime. These relations were\nanalytically derived previously in Westernacher-Schneider, Lehner, Oz (2015)\nfor a relativistic fluid; this work is a continuation of that study, providing\nfurther analytical insights together with numerical experiments to test the\nscaling relations and extract other important features characterizing the\nturbulent behavior. We first explicitly demonstrate that the non-relativistic\nlimit of these scaling relations reduce to known results from the statistical\ntheory of incompressible Navier-Stokes turbulence. In simulations of the\ninverse-cascade range, we find the relevant relativistic scaling relation is\nsatisfied to a high degree of accuracy. We observe that the non-relativistic\nversions of this scaling relation underperform the relativistic one in both an\nabsolute and relative sense, with a progressive degradation as the rms Mach\nnumber increases from $0.14$ to $0.19$. In the direct-cascade range, the two\nrelevant relativistic scaling relations are satisfied with a lower degree of\naccuracy in a simulation with rms Mach number $0.11$. We elucidate the poorer\nagreement with further simulations of an incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid.\nFinally, as has been observed in the incompressible Navier-Stokes case, we show\nthat the energy spectrum in the inverse-cascade of the conformal fluid exhibits\n$k^{-2}$ scaling rather than the Kolmogorov/Kraichnan expectation of\n$k^{-5/3}$, and that it is not necessarily associated with compressive effects.\nWe comment on the implications for a recent calculation of the fractal\ndimension of a turbulent $(3+1)$-dimensional AdS black brane.\n", "  Radiative neutron capture is an important nuclear reaction whose accurate\ndescription is needed for many applications ranging from nuclear technology to\nnuclear astrophysics. The description of such a process relies on the\nHauser-Feshbach theory which requires the nuclear optical potential, level\ndensity and $\\gamma$-strength function as model inputs. It has recently been\nsuggested that the M1 scissors mode may explain discrepancies between\ntheoretical calculations and evaluated data. We explore statistical model\ncalculations with the strength of the M1 scissors mode estimated to be\ndependent on the nuclear deformation of the compound system. We show that the\nform of the M1 scissors mode improves the theoretical description of evaluated\ndata and the match to experiment in both the fission product and actinide\nregions. Since the scissors mode occurs in the range of a few keV $\\sim$ a few\nMeV, it may also impact the neutron capture cross sections of neutron-rich\nnuclei that participate in the rapid neutron capture process of\nnucleosynthesis. We comment on the possible impact to nucleosynthesis by\nevaluating neutron capture rates for neutron-rich nuclei with the M1 scissors\nmode active.\n", "  BMS symmetry, which is the asymptotic symmetry at null infinity of flat\nspacetime, is an important input for flat holography. In this paper, we give a\nholographic calculation of entanglement entropy and R\\'{e}nyi entropy in three\ndimensional Einstein gravity and Topologically Massive Gravity. The geometric\npicture for the entanglement entropy is the length of a spacelike geodesic\nwhich is connected to the interval at null infinity by two null geodesics. The\nspacelike geodesic is the fixed points of replica symmetry, and the null\ngeodesics are along the modular flow. Our strategy is to first reformulate the\nRindler method for calculating entanglement entropy in a general setup, and\napply it for BMS invariant field theories, and finally extend the calculation\nto the bulk.\n", "  The Universal One-Loop Effective Action (UOLEA) is a general expression for\nthe effective action obtained by evaluating in a model-independent way the\none-loop expansion of a functional path integral. It can be used to match UV\ntheories to their low-energy EFTs more efficiently by avoiding redundant steps\nin the application of functional methods, simplifying the process of obtaining\nWilson coefficients of operators up to dimension six. In addition to loops\ninvolving only heavy fields, matching may require the inclusion of loops\ncontaining both heavy and light particles. Here we use the recently-developed\ncovariant diagram technique to extend the UOLEA to include heavy-light terms\nwhich retain the same universal structure as the previously-derived heavy-only\nterms. As an example of its application, we integrate out a heavy singlet\nscalar with a linear coupling to a light doublet Higgs. The extension presented\nhere is a first step towards completing the UOLEA to incorporate all possible\nstructures encountered in a covariant derivative expansion of the one-loop path\nintegral.\n", "  We report attosecond-scale probing of the laser-induced dynamics in\nmolecules. We apply the method of high-harmonic spectroscopy, where\nlaser-driven recolliding electrons on various trajec- tories record the motion\nof their parent ion. Based on the transient phase-matching mechanism of\nhigh-order harmonic generation, short and long trajectories contributing to the\nsame harmonic order are distinguishable in both the spatial and frequency\ndomains, giving rise to a one-to-one map between time and photon energy for\neach trajectory. The short and long trajectories in H2 and D2 are used\nsimultaneously to retrieve the nuclear dynamics on the attosecond and angstrom\nscale. Compared to using only short trajectories, this extends the temporal\nrange of the measurement to one optical cycle. The experiment is also applied\nto methane and ammonia molecules.\n", "  We propose a physically motivated decomposition of DFT 3-body nonadditive\ninteraction energies into the exchange and density-deformation (polarization)\ncomponents. The exchange component represents the effect of the Pauli exclusion\nin the wave function of the trimer and is found to be challenging for density\nfunctional approximations (DFAs). The remaining density-deformation\nnonadditivity is less dependent upon the DFAs. Numerical demonstration is\ncarried out for rare gas atom trimers, Ar$_2$-HX (X = F, Cl) complexes, and\nsmall hydrogen-bonded and van der Waals molecular systems. None of the tested\nsemilocal, hybrid, and range-separated DFAs properly accounts for the\nnonadditive exchange in dispersion-bonded trimers. By contrast, for\nhydrogen-bonded systems range-separated hybrids achieve a qualitative agreement\nto within 20% of the reference exchange energy. A reliable performance for all\nsystems is obtained only when the monomers interact through the Hartree-Fock\npotential in the dispersion-free Pauli Blockade scheme. Additionally, we\nidentify the nonadditive second-order exchange-dispersion energy as an\nimportant but overlooked contribution in force-field-like dispersion\ncorrections. Our results suggest that range-separated functionals do not\ninclude this component although semilocal and global hybrid DFAs appear to\nimitate it in the short range.\n", "  Solar UV bursts are small-scale features that exhibit intermittent\nbrightenings that are thought to be due to magnetic reconnection. They are\nobserved abundantly in the chromosphere and transition region, in particular in\nactive regions. We investigate in detail a UV burst related to a magnetic\nfeature that is advected by the moat flow from a sunspot towards a pore. The\nmoving feature is parasitic in that its magnetic polarity is opposite to that\nof the spot and the pore. We used UV spectroscopic and slit-jaw observations\nfrom the IRIS to identify and study chromospheric and transition region\nspectral signatures of said UV burst. To investigate the magnetic topology\nsurrounding the UV burst, we used a two-hour-long time sequence of simultaneous\nline-of-sight magnetograms from the HMI and performed data-driven 3D magnetic\nfield extrapolations by means of a magnetofrictional relaxation technique. We\ncan connect UV burst signatures to the overlying EUV coronal loops observed by\nthe AIA. The UV burst shows a variety of extremely broad line profiles\nindicating plasma flows in excess of $\\pm$200 km s$^{-1}$ at times. The whole\nstructure is divided into two spatially distinct zones of predominantly up- and\ndownflows. The magnetic field extrapolations show a persistent fan-spine\nmagnetic topology at the UV burst. The associated 3D magnetic null point exists\nat a height of about 500 km above the photosphere and evolves co-spatially with\nthe observed UV burst. The EUV emission at the footpoints of coronal loops is\ncorrelated with the evolution of the underlying UV burst. The magnetic field\naround the null point is sheared by photospheric motions, triggering magnetic\nreconnection that ultimately powers the observed UV burst and energises the\noverlying coronal loops. The location of the null point suggests that the burst\nis triggered low in the solar chromosphere.\n", "  Synchronization of non-identical oscillators coupled through complex networks\nis an important example of collective behavior. It is interesting to ask how\nthe structural organization of network interactions influences this process.\nSeveral studies have uncovered optimal topologies for synchronization by making\npurposeful alterations to a network. Yet, the connectivity patterns of many\nnatural systems are often not static, but are rather modulated over time\naccording to their dynamics. This co-evolution - and the extent to which the\ndynamics of the individual units can shape the organization of the network\nitself - is not well understood. Here, we study initially randomly connected\nbut locally adaptive networks of Kuramoto oscillators. The system employs a\nco-evolutionary rewiring strategy that depends only on instantaneous, pairwise\nphase differences of neighboring oscillators, and that conserves the total\nnumber of edges, allowing the effects of local reorganization to be isolated.\nWe find that a simple regulatory rule - which preserves connections between\nmore out-of-phase oscillators while rewiring connections between more in-phase\noscillators - can cause initially disordered networks to organize into more\nstructured topologies that support enhanced synchronization dynamics. We\nexamine how this process unfolds over time, finding both a dependence on the\nintrinsic frequencies of the oscillators and the global coupling. For large\nenough coupling and after sufficient adaptation, the resulting networks exhibit\ndegree - frequency and frequency - neighbor frequency correlations. These\nproperties have previously been associated with optimal synchronization or\nexplosive transitions. By considering a time-dependent interplay between\nstructure and dynamics, this work offers a mechanism through which emergent\nphenomena can arise in complex systems utilizing local rules.\n", "  Recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations suggest that baryonic\nprocesses, and in particular supernova feedback after bursts of star formation,\ncan alter the structure of dark matter haloes and transform primordial cusps\ninto shallower cores. To assess whether this mechanism offers a solution to the\ncusp-core controversy, simulated haloes must be compared to real dark matter\nhaloes inferred from galaxy rotation curves. For this purpose, two new dark\nmatter density profiles were recently derived from simulations of galaxies in\ncomplementary mass ranges: the DC14 halo ($10^{10} < M_{\\text{halo}}/M_{\\odot}\n< 8 \\times 10^{11}$) and the coreNFW halo ($10^{7} < M_{\\text{halo}}/M_{\\odot}\n< 10^{9}$). Both models have individually been found to give good fits to\nobserved rotation curves. For the DC14 model, however, the agreement of the\npredicted halo properties with cosmological scaling relations was confirmed by\none study, but strongly refuted by another. A next question is whether the two\nmodels converge to the same solution in the mass range where both should be\nappropriate. To investigate this, we tested the DC14 and cNFW halo models on\nthe rotation curves of a selection of galaxies with halo masses in the range $4\n\\times 10^{9}$ - $7 \\times 10^{10}$ $M_{\\odot}$. We further applied the DC14\nmodel to a set of rotation curves at higher halo masses, up to $9 \\times\n10^{11}$ $M_{\\odot}$, to verify the agreement with the cosmological scaling\nrelations. We find that both models are generally able to reproduce the\nobserved rotation curves, in line with earlier results, and the predicted dark\nmatter haloes are consistent with the cosmological $c-M_{\\text{halo}}$ and\n$M_{*}-M_{\\text{halo}}$ relations. The DC14 and cNFW models are also in fairly\ngood agreement with each other, even though DC14 tends to predict slightly less\nextended cores and somewhat more concentrated haloes than cNFW.\n", "  Recent experiments at RHIC and LHC have demonstrated that there are excellent\nopportunities to produce light baryonic clusters of exotic matter (strange and\nanti-matter) in ultra-relativistic ion collisions. Within the hybrid-transport\nmodel UrQMD we show that the coalescence mechanism can naturally explain the\nproduction of these clusters in the ALICE experiment at LHC. As a consequence\nof this mechanism we predict the rapidity domains where the yields of such\nclusters are much larger than the observed one at midrapidity. This new\nphenomenon can lead to unique methods for producing exotic nuclei.\n", "  The observed burst duration and energies of the neutrinos from Supernova\n1987A strongly limit the possibility of any weakly-interacting light particle\nspecies being produced in the proto-neutron star (PNS) core and leading to\nefficient energy loss. We reexamine this constraint on Weinberg's Higgs portal\nmodel, in which the dark radiation particles (the Goldstone bosons) and the\ndark matter candidate (a Majorana fermion) interact with Standard Model (SM)\nfields solely through the mixing of the SM Higgs boson and a light Higgs boson.\nIn order for the Goldstone bosons to freely stream out of the PNS core region,\nthe Higgs portal coupling has to be about a factor of $4$--$9$ smaller than the\ncurrent collider bound inferred from the SM Higgs invisible decay width. We\nfind that in the energy loss rate calculations, results obtained by using the\none-pion exchange (OPE) approximation and the SP07 global fits for the\nnucleon-nucleon total elastic cross section differ only by a factor $\\lesssim\n3$. The SN 1987A constraints surpass those set by laboratory experiments or by\nthe energy loss arguments in other astrophysical objects such as the gamma-ray\nbursts, even with other nuclear uncertainties taken into account. Furthermore,\nthe SN 1987A constraints are comparable to bounds from the latest dark matter\ndirect search for low-mass WIMPs ($\\lesssim 10~\\Gev$.)\n", "  We demonstrate the control of electron-electron correlation in frustrated\ndouble ionization (FDI) of the two-electron triatomic molecule D$_{3}^{+}$ when\ndriven by two orthogonally polarized two-color laser fields. We employ a\nthree-dimensional semi-classical model that fully accounts for the electron and\nnuclear motion in strong fields. We analyze the FDI probability and the\ndistribution of the momentum of the escaping electron along the polarization\ndirection of the longer wavelength and more intense laser field. These\nobservables when considered in conjunction bear clear signatures of the\nprevalence or absence of electron-electron correlation in FDI, depending on the\ntime-delay between the two laser pulses. We find that D$_{3}^{+}$ is a better\ncandidate compared to H$_{2}$ for demonstrating also experimentally that\nelectron-electron correlation indeed underlies FDI.\n", "  We present the results of a combined $^7$Li NMR and diffraction study on\nLiGa$_{0.95}$In$_{0.05}$Cr$_4$O$_8$, a member of\nLiGa$_{1-x}$In$_{x}$Cr$_4$O$_8$ \"breathing\" pyrochlore family. Via specific\nheat and NMR measurements, we find that the complex sequence of first-order\ntransitions observed for $x=0$ is replaced by a single, apparently second-order\ntransition at $T_f=11$ K. Neutron and X-ray diffraction rule out both\nstructural symmetry lowering and magnetic long-range order as the origin of\nthis transition. Instead, reverse Monte Carlo fitting of the magnetic diffuse\nscattering indicates that the low temperature phase may be described as a\ncollinear spin nematic state, characterized by a quadrupolar order parameter.\nThis state also shows signs of short range order between collinear spin\narrangements on tetrahedra, revealed by mapping the reverse Monte Carlo spin\nconfigurations onto a three-state color model describing the manifold of\nnematic states.\n", "  Structural properties of LaCu$_{6-x}$Ag$_{x}$ have been investigated using\nneutron and x-ray diffraction, and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS)\nmeasurements. Diffraction measurements indicate a continuous structural\ntransition from orthorhombic ($Pnma$) to monoclinic ($P2_1/c$) structure. RUS\nmeasurements show softening of natural frequencies at the structural\ntransition, consistent with the elastic nature of the structural ground state.\nThe structural transition temperatures in LaCu$_{6-x}$Ag$_{x}$ decrease with Ag\ncomposition until the monoclinic phase is completely suppressed at $x_c$ =\n0.225. All of the evidence is consistent with the presence of an elastic\nquantum critical point in LaCu$_{6-x}$Ag$_{x}$.\n", "  This paper presents one analytical tidal theory for a viscoelastic\nmulti-layered body with an arbitrary number of homogeneous layers. Starting\nwith the static equilibrium figure, modified to include tide and differential\nrotation, and using the Newtonian creep approach, we find the dynamical\nequilibrium figure of the deformed body, which allows us to calculate the tidal\npotential and the forces acting on the tide generating body, as well as the\nrotation and orbital elements variations. In the particular case of the\ntwo-layer model, we study the tidal synchronization when the gravitational\ncoupling and the friction in the interface between the layers is added. For\nhigh relaxation factors (low viscosity), the stationary solution of each layer\nis synchronous with the orbital mean motion (n) when the orbit is circular, but\nthe spin rates increase if the orbital eccentricity increases. For low\nrelaxation factors (high viscosity), as in planetary satellites, if friction\nremains low, each layer can be trapped in different spin-orbit resonances with\nfrequencies n/2,n,3n/2,... . We apply the theory to Titan. The main results\nare: i) the rotational constraint does not allow us confirm or reject the\nexistence of a subsurface ocean in Titan; and ii) the crust-atmosphere exchange\nof angular momentum can be neglected. Using the rotation estimate based on\nCassini's observation, we limit the possible value of the shell relaxation\nfactor, when a subsurface ocean is assumed, to 10^-9 Hz, which correspond to a\nshell's viscosity 10^18 Pa s, depending on the ocean's thickness and viscosity\nvalues. In the case in which the ocean does not exist, the maximum shell\nrelaxation factor is one order of magnitude smaller and the corresponding\nminimum shell's viscosity is one order higher.\n", "  In this Letter, we study the motion and wake-patterns of freely rising and\nfalling cylinders in quiescent fluid. We show that the amplitude of oscillation\nand the overall system-dynamics are intricately linked to two parameters: the\nparticle's mass-density relative to the fluid $m^* \\equiv \\rho_p/\\rho_f$ and\nits relative moment-of-inertia $I^* \\equiv {I}_p/{I}_f$. This supersedes the\ncurrent understanding that a critical mass density ($m^*\\approx$ 0.54) alone\ntriggers the sudden onset of vigorous vibrations. Using over 144 combinations\nof ${m}^*$ and $I^*$, we comprehensively map out the parameter space covering\nvery heavy ($m^* > 10$) to very buoyant ($m^* < 0.1$) particles. The entire\ndata collapses into two scaling regimes demarcated by a transitional Strouhal\nnumber, $St_t \\approx 0.17$. $St_t$ separates a mass-dominated regime from a\nregime dominated by the particle's moment of inertia. A shift from one regime\nto the other also marks a gradual transition in the wake-shedding pattern: from\nthe classical $2S$~(2-Single) vortex mode to a $2P$~(2-Pairs) vortex mode.\nThus, auto-rotation can have a significant influence on the trajectories and\nwakes of freely rising isotropic bodies.\n", "  We investigate the Pad\\'e approximation method for the analytic continuation\nof numerical data and its ability to access, from the Euclidean propagator,\nboth the spectral function and part of the physical information hidden in the\nsecond Riemann sheet. We test this method using various benchmarks at zero\ntemperature: a simple perturbative approximation as well as the two-loop\nPhi-derivable approximation. The analytic continuation method is then applied\nto Euclidean data previously obtained in the O(4) symmetric model (within a\ngiven renormalization scheme) to assess the difference between zero-momentum\nand pole masses, which is in general a difficult question to answer within\nnonperturbative approaches such as the Phi-derivable expansion scheme.\n", "  The intermetallic compound \\PFA\\ that possesses a three-dimensional network\nstructure of Al polyhedra centered at the transition metal element Fe and the\nrare earth Pr is investigated through neutron powder diffraction and inelastic\nneutron scattering in order to elucidate the magnetic ground state of Pr and Fe\nand the crystal field effects of Pr. Our neutron diffraction study confirms\nlong-range magnetic order of Pr below $T_N $ = 4.5~K in this compound.\nSubsequent magnetic structure estimation reveals a magnetic propagation vector\n$k$ = ($\\frac{1}{2}$~0~$\\frac{1}{2}$) with a magnetic moment value of\n2.5~$\\mu_\\mathrm{B}$/Pr along the orthorhombic $c$-axis and evidence the lack\nof ordering in the Fe sublattice. The inelastic neutron scattering study\nreveals one crystalline electric field excitation near 19~meV at 5~K in \\PFA.\nThe energy-integrated intensity of the 19~meV excitation as a function of |$Q$|\n$(A^{-1})$ follows the square of the magnetic form factor of Pr$^{3+}$ thereby\nconfirming that the inelastic excitation belongs to the Pr sublattice. The\nsecond sum rule applied to the dynamic structure factor indicates only\n1.6(2)~$\\mu_\\mathrm{B}$ evolving at the 19~meV peak compared to the\n3.58~$\\mu_\\mathrm{B}$ for free Pr$^{3+}$, indicating that the crystal field\nground state is magnetic and the missing moment is associated with the\nresolution limited quasi-elastic line. The magnetic order occurring in Pr in\n\\PFA\\ is counter-intuitive to the symmetry-allowed crystal field level scheme,\nhence, is suggestive of exchange-mediated mechanisms of ordering stemming from\nthe magnetic ground state of the crystal field levels.\n", "  We calculated the magnetic dipole and the electric quadrupole hyperfine\ninteraction constants of 3s3p $^{3,1}P^o_1$ states and the isotope shift,\nincluding mass and field shift, factors for transitions from these two states\nto the ground state 3s$^2~^1S_0$ in Al$^+$ ions using the multiconfiguration\nDirac-Hartree-Fock method. The effects of the electron correlations and the\nBreit interaction on these physical quantities were investigated in detail\nbased on the active space approach. It is found that the CC and the\nhigher-order correlations are considerable for evaluating the uncertainties of\nthe atomic parameters concerned. The uncertainties of the hyperfine interaction\nconstants in this work are less than 1.5\\%. Although the isotope shift factors\nare highly sensitive to the electron correlations, reasonable uncertainties\nwere obtained by exploring the effects of the electron correlations. Moreover,\nwe found that the relativistic nuclear recoil corrections to the mass shift\nfactors are very small and insensitive to the electron correlations for\nAl$^{+}$. These atomic parameters present in this work are valuable for\nextracting the nuclear electric quadrupole moments and the mean-square charge\nradii of Al isotopes.\n"]}
