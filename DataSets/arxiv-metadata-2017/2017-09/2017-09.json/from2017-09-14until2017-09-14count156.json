Almost all kinds of pulsar radiation phenomena are best\nexplained using the MO model, especially polarization characteristics, glitch,\ngeneration rate, the geodetic precession of pulsars and the configuration of\npulsar-wind nebula of the Crab. The MO model also provides satisfactory\nexplanation for other characteristics of pulsars, e.g., interpulse, spin-down,\npulse nulling, beat and pulse drift, the loss rate of the rotating energy, and\nthe accuracy of frequency. We present eight verification methods for the MO\nmodel. In addition to pulsars, our MO model can also be used to explain the\npulse emission from non-compact stars such as the ultracool dwarf TVLM\n513-46546 and the magnetic chemically peculiar star CU Virginis.\n", "  In this work we employ a field theoretical approach to explain the nature of\nthe non-conserved spin current in spintronics. In particular, we consider the\nusual U(1) gauge theory for the electromagnetism at classical level in order to\nobtain the broken continuity equation involving the spin current and\nspin-transfer torque. Inspired in the recent work of A. Vernes, B. L. Gyorffy\nand P. Weinberger where they obtain such equation in terms of relativistic\nquantum mechanics, we formalize their result in terms of the well known\ncurrents of field theory such as the Bargmann-Wigner current and the chiral\ncurrent. Thus, an interpretation of spintronics is provided in terms of Noether\ncurrents (conserved or not) and symmetries of the electromagnetism. In fact,\nthe main result of the present work is that the non-conservation of the spin\ncurrent is associated to the gauge invariance of physical observables where the\nbreaking term is proportional to the chiral current. Moreover, we generalize\ntheir result by including the electromagnetic field as a dynamical field\ninstead of an external one.\n", "  We explore possible pathways for the creation of ultracold polar NaK\nmolecules in their absolute electronic and rovibrational ground state starting\nfrom ultracold Feshbach molecules. In particular, we present a multi-channel\nanalysis of the electronic ground and K(4p)+Na(3s) excited state manifold of\nNaK, analyze the spin character of both the Feshbach molecular state and the\nelectronically excited intermediate states and discuss possible coherent\ntwo-photon transfer paths from Feshbach molecules to rovibronic ground state\nmolecules. The theoretical study is complemented by the demonstration of STIRAP\ntransfer from the X^1\\Sigma^+ (v=0) state to the a^3\\Sigma^+ manifold on a\nmolecular beam experiment.\n", "  Studies of the doping process can provide a better understanding of the\nsuperconducting mechanisms in cuprous oxide materials. In this work, we studied\nthe doping effects on the crystal structure, electric, morphologic and magnetic\nproperties of the BSCCO system with the nominal composition\n$Bi_{1.6}Pb_{0.4}Sr_{(2-x)}RE_xCa_2Cu_3O_{(10-{\\delta})}$. Here, the rare earth\nelement (RE) was replaced by La in the sites of Sr. The x was ranged from 0.0\nto 2.0, in steps of 0.5. The samples were prepared based on Pechini's method.\nThe resulting powder was pressed at room temperature and the pellets were\nsubmitted to several heat treatments. The characterizations confirm the La in\nthe sites of Sr however, the superconducting properties of the sample were not\nimproved.\n", "  Mechanically induced folding of passive cross-linkers is a fundamental\nbiological phenomenon. A typical example is a conformational change in myosin\nII responsible for the power-stroke in skeletal muscles. In this paper we\npresent an athermal perspective on such folding by analyzing the simplest\npurely mechanical prototype: a parallel bundle of bi-stable units attached to a\ncommon backbone. We show that in this analytically transparent model,\ncharacterized by a rugged energy landscape, the ground states are always highly\ncoherent, single-phase configurations. We argue that such cooperative behavior,\nensuring collective conformational change, is due to the dominance of long-\nrange interactions making the system non-additive. The detailed predictions of\nour model are in agreement with experimentally observed non-equivalence of fast\nforce recovery in skeletal muscles loaded in soft and hard devices. Some\nfeatures displayed by the model are also recognizable in the behavior of other\nbiological systems with passive multi-stability and long-range interactions\nincluding detaching adhesive binders and pulled RNA/DNA hairpins.\n", "  We adopted the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) within the\nlinear augmented Slater-type orbitals (LASTO) basis and the cluster averaging\nmethod to compute the {\\color{red}excitation} spectra of III-V ternary alloys\nwith arbitrary concentration $x$. The TDDFT was carried out with the use of\nadiabatic meta-generalized gradient approximation (mGGA), which contains the\n$1/q^2$ singularity in the dynamical exchange-correlation kernel\n($f_{XC,00}(\\mathbf{q})$) as $q\\rightarrow 0$. We found that by using wave\nfunctions obtained in local density approximation (LDA) while using mGGA to\ncompute self-energy correction to the band structures, we can get {\\color{red}\ngood overall} agreement between theoretical results and experimental data for\nthe excitation spectra. Thus, our studies provide some insight into the\ntheoretical calculation of optical spectra of semiconductor alloys.\n", "  This chapter reviews the differential geometry-based solvation and\nelectrolyte transport for biomolecular solvation that have been developed over\nthe past decade. A key component of these methods is the differential geometry\nof surfaces theory, as applied to the solvent-solute boundary. In these\napproaches, the solvent-solute boundary is determined by a variational\nprinciple that determines the major physical observables of interest, for\nexample, biomolecular surface area, enclosed volume, electrostatic potential,\nion density, electron density, etc. Recently, differential geometry theory has\nbeen used to define the surfaces that separate the microscopic (solute) domains\nfor biomolecules from the macroscopic (solvent) domains. In these approaches,\nthe microscopic domains are modeled with atomistic or quantum mechanical\ndescriptions, while continuum mechanics models (including fluid mechanics,\nelastic mechanics, and continuum electrostatics) are applied to the macroscopic\ndomains. This multiphysics description is integrated through an energy\nfunctional formalism and the resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is employed to\nderive a variety of governing partial differential equations for different\nsolvation and transport processes; e.g., the Laplace-Beltrami equation for the\nsolvent-solute interface, Poisson or Poisson-Boltzmann equations for\nelectrostatic potentials, the Nernst-Planck equation for ion densities, and the\nKohn-Sham equation for solute electron density. Extensive validation of these\nmodels has been carried out over hundreds of molecules, including proteins and\nion channels, and the experimental data have been compared in terms of\nsolvation energies, voltage-current curves, and density distributions. We also\npropose a new quantum model for electrolyte transport.\n", "  Recent work of Harland shows that the $SO(3)$-symmetric,\ndimensionally-reduced, charge-$N$ self-dual Yang--Mills calorons on the\nhyperbolic space $ H^3\\times S^1$ may be obtained through constructing\n$N$-vortex solutions of an Abelian Higgs model as in the study of Witten on\nmultiple instantons. In this paper we establish the existence of such minimal\naction charge-$N$ calorons by constructing arbitrarily prescribed $N$-vortex\nsolutions of the Witten type equations.\n", "  The no-hair theorem postulates that the only externally observable properties\nof a black hole are its mass, its electric charge, and its angular momentum. In\nscalar-tensor theories of gravity, a matter distribution around a black hole\ncan lead to the so called \"spontaneous scalarisation\" instability that triggers\nthe development of scalar hair. In the Brans-Dicke type theories, this effect\ncan be understood as a result of tachyonic effective mass of the scalar field.\nHere we consider the instability in the generalised class of scalar-theories\nthat feature non-conformal, i.e. \"disformal\", couplings to matter. Such\ntheories have gained considerable interest in the recent years and have been\nstudied in a wide variety of systems, both cosmological and astrophysical. In\nview of the prospects of gravitational wave astronomy, it is relevant to\nexplore the implications of the theories in the strong-gravity regime. In this\narticle, we concentrate on the spontaneous scalarisation of matter\nconfigurations around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. We find that in the\nmore generic scalar-tensor theories, the instability of the Brans-Dicke theory\ncan be enhanced, suggesting violations of the no-hair theorem. On the other\nhand, we find that, especially if the coupling is very strong, or if the\ngradients in the matter distribution are negligible, the disformal coupling\ntends to stabilise the system.\n", "  It is well known that the presence of multiple constraints of non-Abelian\nrelativisitic Chern--Simons--Higgs vortex equations makes it difficult to\ndevelop an existence theory when the underlying Cartan matrix $K$ of the\nequations is that of a general simple Lie algebra and the strongest result in\nthe literature so far is when the Cartan subalgebra is of dimension 2. In this\npaper we overcome this difficulty by implicitly resolving the multiple\nconstraints using a degree-theorem argument, utilizing a key positivity\nproperty of the inverse of the Cartan matrix deduced in an earlier work of\nLusztig and Tits, which enables a process that converts the equality\nconstraints to inequality constraints in the variational formalism. Thus this\nwork establishes a general existence theorem which settles a long-standing open\nproblem in the field regarding the general solvability of the equations.\n", "  We provide a geometric method to stabilize asymptotically with phase an\narbitrary fixed periodic orbit of a locally generic three-dimensional\nHamiltonian dynamical system. The main advantage of this method is that one\nneeds not know a parameterization of the orbit to be stabilized, but only the\nvalues of the Hamiltonian and a fixed Casimir (of the Poisson configuration\nmanifold) at that orbit. The stabilization procedure is illustrated in the case\nof the Rikitake model of geomagnetic reversal.\n", "  The macroscopic magnetic moment of a superparamagnetic system has to overcome\nan energy barrier in order to switch its direction. This barrier is formed by\nmagnetic anisotropies in the material and may be surmounted typically after\n10^9 to 10^12 attempts per second by thermal fluctuations. In a first step, the\nassociated switching rate may be described by a Neel-Brown-Arrhenius law, in\nwhich the energy barrier is assumed as constant or a given temperature. Yet,\nmagnetic anisotropies in general depend on temperature themselves which is\nknown to modify the Neel-Brown-Arrhenius law. We illustrate quantitatively the\nimplications of a temperature-dependent anisotropy on the switching rate and in\nparticular for the interpretation of the prefactor as an attempt frequency. In\nparticular, we show that realistic numbers for the attempt frequency are\nobtained when the temperature dependence of the anisotropy is taken into\naccount.\n", "  We analyze the dynamic toroidal multipoles and prove that they do not have an\nindependent physical meaning with respect to their interaction with\nelectromagnetic waves. We analytically show how the split into electric and\ntoroidal parts causes the appearance of non-radiative components in each of the\ntwo parts. These non-radiative components, which cancel each other when both\nparts are summed, preclude the separate determination of each part by means of\nmeasurements of the radiation from the source or of its coupling to external\nelectromagnetic waves. In other words, there is no toroidal radiation or\nindependent toroidal electromagnetic coupling. The formal meaning of the\ntoroidal multipoles is clear in our derivations. They are the higher order\nterms of an expansion of the multipolar coefficients of electric parity with\nrespect to the electromagnetic size of the source.\n", "  Non-equilibrium black hole horizons are considered in scaling theories with\ngeneric Lifshitz invariance and an unbroken U(1) symmetry. There is also\ncharge-hyperscaling violation associated with a non-trivial conduction\nexponent. The boundary stress tensor is computed and renormalized and the\nassociated hydrodynamic equations derived. Upon a non-trivial redefinition of\nboundary sources associated with the U(1) gauge field, the equations are mapped\nto the standard non-relativistic hydrodynamics equations coupled to a mass\ncurrent and an external Newton potential in accordance with the general theory\nof [arXiv:1502.00228]. The shear viscosity to entropy ratio is the same as in\nthe relativistic case.\n", "  We provide a prototypical description of mechanically-induced collective\nconformational change (folding), relevant in a variety of biological contexts\nfrom muscle contraction to hair cell gating and integrin binding. Our study is\ninspired by the seminal Huxley-Simmons (HS) model which we reinterpret from the\nperspective of stochastic dynamics involving rigidly coupled bi-stable\nelements. In this interpretation the HS model can be mapped to a paramagnetic\nIsing model, however, the equivalence is not complete due to the presence of\nelastic elements responsible for negative susceptibility and quasi-critical\nbehavior. We go beyond the conventional chemo-mechanical description of such\nsystems, revealing both its strengths and its limitations.\n", "  Inspired by magnetic impurity considerations some broad classes of Abelian\nHiggs and Chern--Simons--Higgs BPS vortex equations are derived and analyzed.\n", "  An important question concerning the classical solutions of the equations of\nmotion arising in quantum field theories at the BPS critical coupling is\nwhether all finite-energy solutions are necessarily BPS. In this paper we\npresent a study of this basic question in the context of the domain wall\nequations whose potential is induced from a superpotential so that the ground\nstates are the critical points of the superpotential. We prove that the\ndefiniteness of the Hessian of the superpotential suffices to ensure that all\nfinite-energy domain-wall solutions are BPS. We give several examples to show\nthat such a BPS property may fail such that non-BPS solutions exist when the\nHessian of the superpotential is indefinite.\n", "  A see-saw scenario for an $A_4$ flavour symmetric standard model is\npresented. The latter, compared with the standard model, has an extended field\ncontent adopting now an additional $A_4$ symmetry structure (along with the\nstandard model symmetry). As before, the see-saw mechanism can be realized in\nseveral models of different types depending on different ways of neutrino mass\ngeneration corresponding to the introduction of new (heavy in general) fields\nwith different symmetry structures. In the present paper, a general description\nof all these see-saw types is made with a more detailed investigation on type-I\nmodels, while for type-II and type-III models a similar strategy can be\nfollowed. As within the original see-saw mechanism, the symmetry structure of\nthe standard model fields decides the number and the symmetry structure of the\nnew fields. In a model considered here, the scalar sector consists of three\nstandard-model-Higgs-like iso-doublets ($SU_L(2)$-doublets) forming together an\n$A_4$-triplet, and three iso-singlets transforming as three singlets (1,$1^{'}$\nand $1^{''}$) of $A_4$. In the lepton sector, the three left-handed lepton\niso-doublets form an $A_4$-triplet, while the three right-handed charged\nleptons are either $A_4$-singlets in one version of the model, or components of\nan $A_4$-triplet in another version. To generate neutrino masses through, say,\nthe type-I see-saw mechanism, it is natural to add four right-handed neutrino\nmultiplets, including one $A_4$-triplet and three $A_4$-singlets. For an\ninterpretation, the model is applied to deriving some physics quantities such\nas neutrinoless double beta decay effective mass $|\\langle m_{ee}\\rangle|$, CP\nviolation phase $\\delta_{CP}$ and Jarlskog parameter $J_{CP}$, which can be\nverified experimentally.\n", "  We introduce FastPM, a highly-scalable approximated particle mesh N-body\nsolver, which implements the particle mesh (PM) scheme enforcing correct linear\ndisplacement (1LPT) evolution via modified kick and drift factors. Employing a\n2-dimensional domain decomposing scheme, FastPM scales extremely well with a\nvery large number of CPUs. In contrast to COmoving-LAgrangian (COLA) approach,\nwe do not require to split the force or track separately the 2LPT solution,\nreducing the code complexity and memory requirements. We compare FastPM with\ndifferent number of steps ($N_s$) and force resolution factor ($B$) against 3\nbenchmarks: halo mass function from Friends of Friends halo finder, halo and\ndark matter power spectrum, and cross correlation coefficient (or\nstochasticity), relative to a high resolution TreePM simulation. We show that\nthe modified time stepping scheme reduces the halo stochasticity when compared\nto COLA with the same number of steps and force resolution. While increasing\n$N_s$ and $B$ improves the transfer function and cross correlation coefficient,\nfor many applications FastPM achieves sufficient accuracy at low $N_s$ and $B$.\nFor example, $N_s=10$ and $B=2$ simulation provides a substantial saving (a\nfactor of 10) of computing time relative to $N_s=40$, $B=3$ simulation, yet the\nhalo benchmarks are very similar at $z=0$. We find that for abundance matched\nhalos the stochasticity remains low even for $N_s=5$. FastPM compares well\nagainst less expensive schemes, being only 7 (4) times more expensive than 2LPT\ninitial condition generator for $N_s=10$ ($N_s=5$). Some of the applications\nwhere FastPM can be useful are generating a large number of mocks, producing\nnon-linear statistics where one varies a large number of nuisance or\ncosmological parameters, or serving as part of an initial conditions solver.\n", "  In physics, experiments ultimately inform us as to what constitutes a good\ntheoretical model of any physical concept: physical space should be no\nexception. The best picture of physical space in Newtonian physics is given by\nthe configuration space of a free particle (or the center of mass of a closed\nsystem of particles). This configuration space (as well as phase space), can be\nconstructed as a representation space for the relativity symmetry. From the\ncorresponding quantum symmetry, we illustrate the construction of a quantum\nconfiguration space, similar to that of quantum phase space, and recover the\nclassical picture as an approximation through a contraction of the (relativity)\nsymmetry and its representations. The quantum Hilbert space reduces into a sum\nof one-dimensional representations for the observable algebra, with the only\nadmissible states given by coherent states and position eigenstates for the\nphase and configuration space pictures, respectively. This analysis, founded\nfirmly on known physics, provides a quantum picture of physical space beyond\nthat of a finite-dimensional manifold, and provides a crucial first link for\nany theoretical model of quantum spacetime at levels beyond simple quantum\nmechanics. It also suggests looking at quantum physics from a different\nperspective.\n", "  YSb crystals are grown and the transport properties under magnetic field are\nmeasured. The resistivity exhibits metallic behavior under zero magnetic field\nand the low temperature resistivity shows a clear upturn once a moderate\nmagnetic field is applied. The upturn is greatly enhanced by increasing\nmagnetic field, finally resulting in a metal-to-insulator-like transition. With\ntemperature further decreased, a resistivity plateau emerges after the\ninsulator-like regime. At low temperature (2.5 K) and high field (14 T), the\ntransverse magnetoresistance (MR) is quite large (3.47 $\\times 10^4\\%$ ). In\naddition, Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillation has also been observed in YSb.\nPeriodic behavior of the oscillation amplitude reveals the related information\nabout Fermi surface and two major oscillation frequencies can be obtained from\nthe FFT spectra of the oscillations. The trivial Berry phase extracted from SdH\noscillation, band structure revealed by angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations demonstrate that YSb is\na topologically trivial material.\n", "  We present optimized aperiodic structures for use as broadband thermal\nincandescent emitters which are capable of increasing the emittance by nearly a\nfactor of two over the visible wavelength range when compared to bulk tungsten.\nThese aperiodic multilayer structures are designed with alternating layers of\ntungsten and air or tungsten and silicon carbide on top of a tungsten\nsubstrate. We investigate the properties of these structures for use as\nlightbulb filaments. We find that these structures greatly enhance the\nemittance over the visible wavelength range, while also increasing the overall\nefficiency of the bulb and could lead to a decrease in incandescent lightbulb\npower consumption by nearly 50%.\n", "  We study various equilibrium thermodynamic properties of blackbody radiation\n(i.e. a photon gas) with an ultraviolet energy cut-off. We find that the energy\ndensity, specific heat etc. follow usual acoustic phonon dynamics as have been\nwell studied by Debye. Other thermodynamic quantities like pressure, entropy\netc. have also been calculated. The usual Stefan-Boltzmann law gets modified.\nWe observe that the values of the thermodynamic quantities with the energy\ncut-off is lower than the corresponding values in the theory without any such\nscale. The phase-space measure is also expected to get modified for an exotic\nspacetime appearing at Planck scale, which in turn leads to the modification of\nPlanck energy density distribution and the Wien's displacement law. We found\nthat the non-perturbative nature of the thermodynamic quantities in the SR\nlimit (for both the case with ultravilolet cut-off and the modified measure\ncase), due to nonanalyticity of the leading term, is a general feature of the\ntheory accompanied with an ultraviolet energy cut-off. We have also discussed\nthe possible modification in the case of Big Bang and the Stellar objects and\nhave suggested a table top experiment for verification in effective low energy\ncase.\n", "  We give a proof of a formula for the trace of self-braidings (in an arbitrary\nchannel) in UMTCs which first appeared in the context of rational conformal\nfield theories (CFTs). The trace is another invariant for UMTCs which depends\nonly on modular data, and contains the expression of the Frobenius-Schur\nindicator as a special case. Furthermore, we discuss some applications of the\ntrace formula to the realizability problem of modular data and to the\nclassification of UMTCs.\n", "  We provide a criterion in order to decide the stability of non-degenerate\nequilibrium states of completely integrable systems. More precisely, given a\nHamilton-Poisson realization of a completely integrable system generated by a\nsmooth $n-$ dimensional vector field, $X$, and a non-degenerate regular (in the\nPoisson sense) equilibrium state, $\\overline{x}_e$, we define a scalar\nquantity, $\\mathcal{I}_{X}(\\overline{x}_e)$, whose sign determines the\nstability of the equilibrium. Moreover, if $\\mathcal{I}_{X}(\\overline{x}_e)>0$,\nthen around $\\overline{x}_e$ there exist one-parameter families of periodic\norbits shrinking to $\\{\\overline{x}_e \\}$, whose periods approach\n$2\\pi/\\sqrt{\\mathcal{I}_{X}(\\overline{x}_e)}$ as the parameter goes to zero.\nThe theoretical results are illustrated in the case of the Rikitake dynamical\nsystem.\n", "  Within the framework of the Bhabha-Madhavarao formalism, a consistent\napproach to the derivation of a system of the fourth order wave equations for\nthe description of a spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ particle is suggested. For this purpose\nan additional algebraic object, the so-called $q$-commutator ($q$ is a\nprimitive fourth root of unity) and a new set of matrices $\\eta_{\\mu}$, instead\nof the original matrices $\\beta_{\\mu}$ of the Bhabha-Madhavarao algebra, are\nintroduced. It is shown that in terms of the $\\eta_{\\mu}$ matrices we have\nsucceeded in reducing a procedure of the construction of fourth root of the\nfourth order wave operator to a few simple algebraic transformations and to\nsome operation of the passage to the limit $z \\rightarrow q$, where $z$ is some\n(complex) deformation parameter entering into the definition of the\n$\\eta$-matrices. In addition, a set of the matrices ${\\cal P}_{1/2}$ and ${\\cal\nP}_{3/2}^{(\\pm)}(q)$ possessing the properties of projectors is introduced.\nThese operators project the matrices $\\eta_{\\mu}$ onto the spins 1/2- and\n3/2-sectors in the theory under consideration. A corresponding generalization\nof the obtained results to the case of the interaction with an external\nelectromagnetic field introduced through the minimal coupling scheme is carried\nout. The application to the problem of construction of the path integral\nrepresentation in parasuperspace for the propagator of a massive\nspin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ particle in a background gauge field within the\nBhabha-Madhavarao approach is discussed.\n", "  We develop a theory of \"arrowed\" (operads and) dioperads, which are to exact\ntriangles as dioperads are to vector spaces. A central example to this paper is\nthe arrowed operad controlling \"derived ideals\" for any operad. The Koszul\nduality theory of arrowed dioperads interacts well with rotation of exact\ntriangles, and in particular with \"exact Stars of David,\" which are pairs of\nexact triangles drawn on top of each other in an interesting way. Using this\nframework, we give a cochain-level lift of the \"relative Poincar\\'e duality\"\nenjoyed by oriented manifolds with boundary; moreover, our cochain-level lift\nsatisfies a natural locality-type condition, and is uniquely determined by this\nproperty. We discuss the meaning of the words \"relative orientation\" and\n\"coisotropic.\" We extend the AKSZ construction to bulk-boundary settings with\nPoisson bulk fields and coisotropic boundary conditions.\n", "  Chern-Simons topological field theories TFTs are the only TFTs that have\nalready found application in the description of some exotic strongly-correlated\nelectron systems and the corresponding concept of topological quantum\ncomputing. Here, we show that TFTs of another type, specifically the\ngauge-field-less Witten-type TFTs known as topological sigma models, describe\nthe recently proposed digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) - engineered\ndynamical systems with point attractors being the solutions of the\ncorresponding logic circuit that solves a specific task. This result derives\nfrom the recent finding that any stochastic differential equation possesses a\ntopological supersymmetry, and the realization that the solution search by a\nDMM proceeds via an instantonic phase. Certain TFT correlators in DMMs then\nreveal the presence of a transient long-range order both in space and time,\nassociated with the effective breakdown of the topological supersymmetry by\ninstantons. The ensuing non-locality and the low dimensionality of instantons\nare the physical reasons why DMMs can solve complex problems efficiently,\ndespite their non-quantum character. We exemplify these results with the\nsolution of prime factorization.\n", "  Transparent Al2O3 ceramics have attracted considerable interest for use in a\nwide range of optical, electronic and structural applications. The fabrication\nof these ceramics using powder metallurgy processes requires the development of\ntheoretical approaches to the compaction of nanopowders. In this work, we\ninvestigate the compaction processes of two model granular systems imitating\nAl2O3 nanosized powders. System I is a loosely aggregated powder, and system II\nis a powder strongly inclined to agglomeration (for instance, calcined powder).\nThe processes of isostatical (uniform), biaxial, and uniaxial compaction as\nwell as uniaxial compaction with simultaneous shear deformation are studied.\nThe energy parameters of compaction such as the energy change of elastic\ninterparticle interactions and dispersion interactions, dissipative energy\nlosses related to the processes of interparticle friction, and the total work\nof compaction are calculated for all the processes. The nonapplicability of the\nassociated flow rule to the description of deformation processes of oxide\nnanopowders is shown and an alternative plastic flow rule is suggested. A\ncomplete system of determining the relationship of the flow including\nanalytical approximations of yield surfaces is obtained.\n", "  It has been reported that the cool down dynamics across $T_c$ has a\nsignificant influence on the observed quality factors $Q_0$ of a cavity, which\nis most likely due to trapped flux. In this document we show the results of the\ninvestigation if such a correlation can be observed during the European XFEL\ncavity production.\n", "  Discovered in high-energy physics, the chiral anomaly has recently made way\nto materials science by virtue of Weyl semimetals (WSM). Thus far, the main\nefforts to probe the chiral anomaly in WSM have concentrated on electronic\nphenomena. Here, we show that the chiral anomaly can have a large impact in the\n$A_1$ phonons of enantiomorphic WSM. In these materials, the chiral anomaly\nproduces an unusual magnetic-field-induced resonance in the effective phonon\ncharge, which in turn leads to anomalies in the phonon dispersion, optical\nreflectivity, and the Raman scattering.\n", "  Non-locality stands nowadays not only as one of the cornerstones of quantum\ntheory, but also plays a crucial role in quantum information processing.\nSeveral experimental investigations of nonlocality have been carried out over\nthe years. In spite of their fundamental relevance, however, all previous\nexperiments do not consider a crucial ingredient that is ubiquitous in quantum\nnetworks: the fact that correlations between distant parties are mediated by\nseveral, typically independent, sources of quantum states. Here, using a\nphotonic setup we investigate a quantum network consisting of three spatially\nseparated nodes whose correlations are mediated by two independent sources.\nThis scenario allows for the emergence of a new kind of non-local correlations\nthat we experimentally witness by violating a novel Bell inequality. Our\nresults provide the first experimental proof-of-principle of generalizations of\nBell's theorem for networks, a topic that has attracted growing attention and\npromises a novel route for quantum communication protocols.\n", "  We study local instabilities of a differentially rotating viscous flow of\nelectrically conducting incompressible fluid subject to an external azimuthal\nmagnetic field. In the presence of the magnetic field the hydrodynamically\nstable flow can demonstrate non - axisymmetric azimuthal magnetorotational\ninstability (AMRI) both in the diffusionless case and in the double-diffusive\ncase with viscous and ohmic dissipation. Performing stability analysis of\namplitude transport equations of short-wavelength approximation, we find that\nthe threshold of the diffusionless AMRI via the Hamilton-Hopf bifurcation is a\nsingular limit of the thresholds of the viscous and resistive AMRI\ncorresponding to the dissipative Hopf bifurcation and manifests itself as the\nWhitney umbrella singular point. A smooth transition between the two types of\ninstabilities is possible only if the magnetic Prandtl number is equal to\nunity, $\\rm Pm=1$. At a fixed $\\rm Pm\\ne 1$ the threshold of the\ndouble-diffusive AMRI is displaced by finite distance in the parameter space\nwith respect to the diffusionless case even in the zero dissipation limit. The\ncomplete neutral stability surface contains three Whitney umbrella singular\npoints and two mutually orthogonal intervals of self-intersection. At these\nsingularities the double-diffusive system reduces to a marginally stable system\nwhich is either Hamiltonian or parity-time (PT) symmetric.\n", "  We look for exact solutions in scalar field cosmology. To achieve this we use\n$f(R)$ modified gravity with a scalar field and do not specify the the form of\nthe $f(R)$ function. In particular, we study Friedmann universe assuming that\nacceleration of the scalar curvature is negligible. We first present solutions\nfor special cases and then the general solution. Using initial conditions which\nrepresent the universe at the present epoch, we evaluated the constants of\nintegration. This allows for the comparison of the scale factor in the new\nsolutions with that of the $\\Lambda CDM$ solution, thereby affecting the age of\nthe universe in $f(R)$ gravity.\n", "  We present an innovative fiber laser system for both cesium and rubidium\nmanipulation. The architecture is based on frequency conversion of two lasers\nat 1560 nm and 1878 nm. By taking advantage of existing fiber components at\nthese wavelengths, we demonstrate an all fiber laser system delivering 350 mW\nat 780 nm for rubidium and 210 mW at 852 nm for cesium. This result highlights\nthe promising nature of such laser system especially for Cs manipulation for\nwhich no fiber laser system has been reported. It offers new perspectives for\nthe development of atomic instruments dedicated to onboard applications and\nopens the way to a new generation of atom interferometers involving three\natomic species $^{85}$Rb, $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs for which we propose an\noriginal laser architecture.\n", "  The derivation of Lifshitz-invariant hydrodynamics from holography, presented\nin [arXiv:1508.02494] is generalized to arbitrary hyperscaling violating\nLifshitz scaling theories with an unbroken U(1) symmetry. The hydrodynamics\nemerging is non-relativistic with scalar \"forcing\". By a redefinition of the\npressure it becomes standard non-relativistic hydrodynamics in the presence of\nspecific chemical potential for the mass current. The hydrodynamics is\ncompatible with the scaling theory of Lifshitz invariance with hyperscaling\nviolation. The bulk viscosity vanishes while the shear viscosity to entropy\nratio is the same as in the relativistic case. We also consider the dimensional\nreduction ansatz for the hydrodynamics and clarify the difference with previous\nresults suggesting a non-vanishing bulk viscosity.\n", "  The goal of this article is to review the progress of three-electron spin\nqubits from their inception to the state of the art. We direct the main focus\ntowards the resonant exchange (RX) qubit and the exchange-only qubit, but we\nalso discuss other qubit implementations using three electron spins. For each\nthree-spin qubit we describe the qubit model, the physical realization, the\nimplementations of single-qubit operations, as well as the read-out and\ninitialization schemes. Two-qubit gates and decoherence properties are\ndiscussed for the RX qubit and the exchange-only qubit, thereby, completing the\nlist of requirements for a viable candidate qubit implementation for quantum\ncomputation. We start with describing the full system of three electrons in a\ntriple quantum dot, then discuss the charge-stability diagram and restrict\nourselves to the relevant subsystem, introduce the qubit states, and discuss\nimportant transitions to other charge states. Introducing the various qubit\nimplementations, we begin with the exchange-only qubit, followed by the\nspin-charge qubit, the hybrid qubit, and the RX qubit, discussing for each the\nsingle-qubit operations, read-out, and initialization methods, whereas the main\nfocus will be on the RX qubit, whose single-qubit operations are realized by\ndriving the qubit at its resonant frequency in the microwave range similar to\nelectron spin resonance. Two different types of two-qubit operations are\npresented for the exchange-only and the RX qubit which can be divided into\nshort-ranged and long-ranged interactions. Both of these interaction types can\nbe expected to be necessary in a large-scale quantum computer. We also take\ninto account the decoherence of the qubit through the influence of magnetic\nnoise as well as dephasing due to charge noise.\n", "  Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) crystals, as direct-gap\nmaterials with unusually strong light-matter interaction, have attracted much\nrecent attention. In contrast to the initial understanding, the minima of the\nconduction band are predicted to be spin split. Because of this splitting and\nthe spin-polarized character of the valence bands, the lowest-lying excitonic\nstates in WX2 (X=S, Se) are expected to be spin-forbidden and optically dark.\nTo date, however, there has been no direct experimental probe of these dark\nband-edge excitons, which strongly influence the light emission properties of\nthe material. Here we show how an in-plane magnetic field can brighten the dark\nexcitonic states and allow their properties to be revealed experimentally in\nmonolayer WSe2. In particular, precise energy levels for both the neutral and\ncharged dark excitons were obtained and compared with ab-initio calculations\nusing the GW-BSE approach. Greatly increased emission and valley lifetimes were\nobserved for the brightened dark states as a result of their spin\nconfiguration. These studies directly probe the excitonic spin manifold and\nprovide a new route to tune the optical and valley properties of these\nprototypical two-dimensional semiconductors.\n", "  In this work, we calculate the $CP$-averaged branching ratios and the direct\n$CP$-violating asymmetries of the quasi-two-body decays $B_{(s)} \\to P (\\rho\n\\to) \\pi\\pi$ by employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach (here $P$ stands\nfor a light pseudoscalar meson $\\pi, K, \\eta$ or $\\eta^{\\prime}$). The vector\ncurrent time-like form factor $F_{\\pi}$, which contains the final state\ninteractions between the pion pair in the resonant region associated with the\n$P$-wave states $\\rho(770)$ along with the two-pion distribution amplitudes,\nare employed to describe the interactions between the $\\rho$ and the pion pair\nunder the hypothesis of the conserved vector current. We found that (a) the\nPQCD predictions for the branching ratios and the direct $CP$-violating\nasymmetries for most considered $B_{(s)} \\to P (\\rho \\to) \\pi\\pi$ decays agree\nwith currently available data within errors; (b) for ${\\cal B}(B \\to \\pi^0\n\\rho^0 \\to \\pi^0(\\pi^+ \\pi^-)$, the PQCD prediction is much smaller than the\nmeasured one; and (c) for $B^+ \\to \\pi^+(\\rho^0\\to)\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ decay mode, we\nfound a negative $CP$ asymmetry $(-27.5^{+3.0}_{-3.7})\\%$, which agrees with\nother theoretical predictions but different in sign from those as reported by\nBaBar and LHCb Collaboration.\n", "  I classify multiphoton absorption into separable, linked, and simultaneous\nprocesses. The first and second types can be distinguished when the\nrate-equation approximation is valid whereas the third type refers to the case\nwhen the full description of multiphoton absorption is essential. For this\npurpose, rate equations are solved analytically without decay processes which\nshows that even if many photons are absorbed the interaction with the light\nfield is linear and one has the case of separable multiphoton absorption. Next\na short-pulse approximation is investigated in which I first solve the rate\nequations without decay processes and then solve only rate equations for the\nensuing decay. Finally, the full rate equations are examined and a successive\napproximation of the underlying Volterra integral equation of the second kind\nis derived leading to linked multiphoton absorption by the involved decay\nwidths. The three methods are applied to a nitrogen atom in intense and\nultrafast x rays from free-electron lasers (FELs). The linearity theorem barely\napproximates the results in the presence of decay processes which is also not\nsatisfactorily corrected for by the short-pulse approximation. The successive\napproximation gives excellent agreement with the numerically-exact solution of\nthe rate equations.\n", "  We present the construction and stochastic summation of rooted-tree diagrams,\nbased on the expansion of a root finding algorithm applied to the\nDyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs). The mathematical formulation shows superior\nconvergence properties compared to the bold diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach\nand the developed algorithm allows one to tackle generic high-dimensional\nintegral equations, to avoid the curse of dealing explicitly with\nhigh-dimensional objects and to access non-perturbative regimes. The sign\nproblem remains the limiting factor, but it is not found to be worse than in\nother approaches. We illustrate the method for $\\phi^4$ theory but note that it\napplies in principle to any model.\n", "  We study the statics and dynamics of a stable, mobile, self-bound\nthree-dimensional dipolar matter-wave droplet created in the presence of a tiny\nrepulsive three-body interaction. In frontal collision with an impact parameter\nand in angular collision at large velocities {along all directions} two\ndroplets behave like quantum solitons. Such collision is found to be quasi\nelastic and the droplets emerge undeformed after collision without any change\nof velocity. However, in a collision at small velocities the axisymmeric\ndipolar interaction plays a significant role and the collision dynamics is\nsensitive to the direction of motion. For an encounter along the $z$ direction\nat small velocities, two droplets, polarized along the $z$ direction, coalesce\nto form a larger droplet $-$ a droplet molecule. For an encounter along the $x$\ndirection at small velocities, the same droplets stay apart and never meet each\nother due to the dipolar repulsion. The present study is based on an analytic\nvariational approximation and a numerical solution of the mean-field\nGross-Pitaevskii equation using the parameters of $^{52}$Cr atoms.\n", "  We consider the statics and dynamics of a stable, mobile three-dimensional\n(3D) spatiotemporal light bullet in a cubic-quintic nonlinear medium with a\nfocusing cubic nonlinearity above a critical value and any defocusing quintic\nnonlinearity. The 3D light bullet can propagate with a constant velocity in any\ndirection. Stability of the light bullet under a small perturbation is\nestablished numerically.We consider frontal collision between two light bullets\nwith different relative velocities. At large velocities the collision is\nelastic with the bullets emerge after collision with practically no distortion.\nAt small velocities two bullets coalesce to form a bullet molecule. At a small\nrange of intermediate velocities the localized bullets could form a single\nentity which expands indefinitely leading to a destruction of the bullets after\ncollision. The present study is based on an analytic Lagrange variational\napproximation and a full numerical solution of the 3D nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation.\n", "  Results of systematic molecular dynamics studies of ethanol-water mixtures,\nover the entire concentration range, were reported previously to agree with\nexperimental X-ray diffraction data. These simulated systems are analyzed in\nthis work to examine cluster formation and percolation, using four different\nhydrogen bond definitions. Percolation analyses revealed that each mixture\n(even the one containing 80 mol % ethanol) is above the 3D percolation\nthreshold, with fractal dimensions, df, between 2.6 to 2.9, depending on\nconcentration. Monotype water cluster formation was also studied in the\nmixtures: 3D water percolation can be found in systems with less than 40 mol %\nethanol, with fractal dimensions between 2.53 and 2.84. These observations can\nbe put in parallel with experimental data on some thermodynamic quantities,\nsuch as the excess partial molar enthalpy and entropy.\n", "  The absence of both spin freezing and of a static Jahn-Teller effect have\nlead to the proposition that Ba$_3$CuSb$_2$O$_9$ is a quantum spin-orbital\nliquid. However, theoretical understanding of the microscopic origin of this\nbehavior has been hampered by a lack of consensus on the lattice structure. Cu\nions have been proposed to realize either a triangular lattice, a short-range\nordered honeycomb lattice or a disordered lattice with stripelike correlations.\nHere we analyze the stability of idealized versions of these arrangements using\ndensity functional theory. We find stripe order of Cu ions to be energetically\nfavored, hinting towards stripelike local Cu-Cu arrangements, while long-range\norder is presumably hindered due to disorder effects. Furthermore, we find\nevidence of significant interlayer interactions between Cu-Sb dumbbells, which\naffects the out-of-plane arrangement. Analysis of the relaxed crystal\nstructures, electronic properties and tight-binding parameters provides clues\nas to the nature of the Jahn-Teller distortions.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the controlled teleportation protocol using\noptical qubits within the single-rail logic. The protocol makes use of an\nentangled tripartite state shared by the controller and two further parties\n(users) who will perform standard teleportation. The goal of the protocol is to\nguarantee that the teleportation is successful only with the permission of the\ncontroller. Optical qubits based on either superpositions of vacuum and\nsingle-photon states or superposition of coherent states are employed here to\nencode a tripartite maximal slice state upon which the protocol is based. We\ncompare the performances of these two encodings under losses which are present\nwhen the qubits are guided through an optical fiber to the users. Finally, we\ninvestigate the non-locality of the shared tripartite state to see whether or\nnot it impacts the efficiency of the protocol.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a pulse-gated semiconductor double quantum dot\nqubit. In our experiments, the qubit coherence times are relatively long, but\nthe visibility of the quantum oscillations is low. We show that these\nobservations are consistent with a theory that incorporates decoherence arising\nfrom charge noise that gives rise to detuning fluctuations of the double dot.\nBecause effects from charge noise are largest near the singlet-triplet avoided\nlevel crossing, the visibility of the oscillations are low when the\nsinglet-triplet avoided level crossing occurs in the vicinity of the charge\ndegeneracy point crossed during the manipulation, but there is only modest\ndephasing at the large detuning value at which the quantum phase accumulates.\nThis theory agrees well with experimental data and predicts that the visibility\ncan be increased greatly by appropriate tuning of the interdot tunneling rate.\n", "  Because of their quantum fluctuations, axion fields had a chance to\nexperience field excursions traversing many minima of their potentials during\ninflation. We study this situation by analyzing the dynamics of an\naxion-spectator field $\\psi$, present during inflation, with a periodic\npotential given by $v(\\psi) = \\Lambda^4 [1 - \\cos (\\psi / f)]$. By assuming\nthat the vacuum expectation value of the field is stabilized at one of its\nminima, say $\\psi = 0$, we compute every $n$-point correlation function of\n$\\psi$ up to first order in $\\Lambda^4$ using the in-in formalism. This\ncomputation allows us to identify the distribution function describing the\nprobability of measuring $\\psi$ at a particular amplitude during inflation.\nBecause $\\psi$ is able to tunnel between the barriers of the potential, we find\nthat the probability distribution function consists of a non-Gaussian\nmultimodal distribution such that the probability of measuring $\\psi$ at a\nminimum of $v(\\psi)$ different from $\\psi=0$ increases with time. As a result,\nat the end of inflation, different patches of the Universe are characterized by\ndifferent values of the axion field amplitude, leading to important\ncosmological phenomenology: (a) Isocurvature fluctuations induced by the axion\nat the end of inflation could be highly non-Gaussian. (b) If the axion defines\nthe strength of standard model couplings, then one is led to a concrete\nrealization of the multiverse. (c) If the axion corresponds to dark matter, one\nis led to the possibility that, within our observable Universe, dark matter\nstarted with a nontrivial initial condition, implying novel signatures for\nfuture surveys.\n", "  For the XXZ subclass of symmetric two-qubit X states, we study the behavior\nof quantum conditional entropy S_{cond} as a function of measurement angle\n\\theta\\in[0,\\pi/2]. Numerical calculations show that the function\nS_{cond}(\\theta) for X states can have at most one local extremum in the open\ninterval from zero to \\pi/2 (unimodality property). If the extremum is a\nminimum the quantum discord displays region with variable (state-dependent)\noptimal measurement angle \\theta^*. Such \\theta-regions (phases, fractions) are\nvery tiny in the space of X state parameters. We also discover the cases when\nthe conditional entropy has a local maximum inside the interval (0,\\pi/2). It\nis remarkable that the maxima exist in surprisingly wide regions and the\nboundaries for such regions are defined by the same bifurcation conditions as\nfor those with a minimum. Moreover, the found maxima can exceed the conditional\nentropy values at the ends of interval [0,\\pi/2] more than by 1%. This instils\nhope in the possibility to detect such maxima in experiment.\n", "  We present an elementary derivation and generalisation of a recently reported\nmethod of simulating feedback in open quantum systems. We use our generalised\nmethod to simulate systems with multiple delays, as well as cascaded systems\nwith delayed backscatter. In addition, we derive a generalisation of the\nquantum regression formula that applies to systems with delayed feedback, and\nshow how to use the formula to compute two-time correlation functions of the\nsystem as well as output field properties. Finally, we show that delayed\ncoherent feedback can be simulated as a quantum teleportation protocol that\nrequires only Markovian resources, pre-shared entanglement, and time travel.\nThe requirement for time travel can be avoided by using a probabilistic\nprotocol.\n", "  Decoy-state quantum key distribution is a standard tool for long-distance\nquantum communications. An important issue in this field is processing the\ndecoy-state statistics taking into account statistical fluctuations (or\n\"finite-key effects\"). In this work, we propose and analyze an option for decoy\nstatistics processing, which is based on the central limit theorem. We discuss\nsuch practical issues as an inclusion of the failure probability of the\ndecoy-states statistical estimates in the total failure probability of a QKD\nprotocol and also taking into account the deviations of the binomially\ndistributed random variables used in the estimations from the Gaussian\ndistribution. The results of numerical simulations show that the obtained\nestimations are quite tight. The proposed technique can be used as a part of\npost-processing procedures for industrial quantum key distribution systems.\n", "  Both conservation laws and practical restrictions impose symmetry constraints\non the dynamics of open quantum systems. In the case of time-translation\nsymmetry, which arises naturally in many physically relevant scenarios, the\nquantum coherence between energy eigenstates becomes a valuable resource for\nquantum information processing. In this work we identify the minimum amount of\ndecoherence compatible with this symmetry for a given population dynamics. This\nyields a generalisation to higher-dimensional systems of the relation $T_2 \\leq\n2 T_1$ for qubit decoherence and relaxation times. It also enables us to\nwitness and assess the role of non-Markovianity as a resource for coherence\npreservation and transfer. Moreover, we discuss the relationship between\nergodicity and the ability of Markovian dynamics to indefinitely sustain a\nsuperposition of different energy states. Finally, we establish a formal\nconnection between the resource-theoretic and the master equation approaches to\nthermodynamics, with the former being a non-Markovian generalisation of the\nlatter. Our work thus brings the abstract study of quantum coherence as a\nresource towards the realm of actual physical applications.\n", "  Digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) are non-linear dynamical systems\ndesigned so that their equilibrium points are solutions of the Boolean problem\nthey solve. In a previous work [Chaos 27, 023107 (2017)] it was argued that\nwhen DMMs support solutions of the associated Boolean problem then strange\nattractors cannot coexist with such equilibria. In this work, we demonstrate\nsuch conjecture. In particular, we show that both topological transitivity and\nthe strongest property of topological mixing are inconsistent with the point\ndissipative property of DMMs when equilibrium points are present. This is true\nfor both the whole phase space and the global attractor. Absence of topological\ntransitivity is enough to imply absence of chaotic behavior. In a similar vein,\nwe prove that if DMMs do not have equilibrium points, the only attractors\npresent are invariant tori/periodic orbits with periods that may possibly\nincrease with system size (quasi-attractors).\n", "  Population annealing is a promising recent approach for Monte Carlo\nsimulations in statistical physics, in particular for the simulation of systems\nwith complex free-energy landscapes. It is a hybrid method, combining\nimportance sampling through Markov chains with elements of sequential Monte\nCarlo in the form of population control. While it appears to provide\nalgorithmic capabilities for the simulation of such systems that are roughly\ncomparable to those of more established approaches such as parallel tempering,\nit is intrinsically much more suitable for massively parallel computing. Here,\nwe tap into this structural advantage and present a highly optimized\nimplementation of the population annealing algorithm on GPUs that promises\nspeed-ups of several orders of magnitude as compared to a serial implementation\non CPUs. While the sample code is for simulations of the 2D ferromagnetic Ising\nmodel, it should be easily adapted for simulations of other spin models,\nincluding disordered systems. Our code includes implementations of some\nadvanced algorithmic features that have only recently been suggested, namely\nthe automatic adaptation of temperature steps and a multi-histogram analysis of\nthe data at different temperatures.\n", "  Electron correlations tend to generate local magnetic moments that usually\norder if the lattices are not too frustrated. The hexagonal compound\nSrRu$_2$O$_6$ has a relatively high Neel temperature but small local moments,\nwhich seem to be at odds with the nominal valence of Ru$^{5+}$ in the\n$t_{2g}^3$ configuration. Here, we investigate the electronic property of\nSrRu$_2$O$_6$ using density functional theory (DFT) combined with\ndynamical-mean-field theory (DMFT). We find that the strong hybridization\nbetween Ru $d$ and O $p$ states results in a Ru valence that is closer to $+4$,\nleading to the small ordered moment $\\sim1.2\\mu_B$. While this is consistent\nwith a DFT prediction, correlation effects are found to play a significant\nrole. The local moment per Ru site remains finite $\\sim2.3\\mu_B$ in the whole\ntemperature range investigated. Due to the lower symmetry, the $t_{2g}$\nmanifold is split and the quasiparticle weight is renormalized significantly in\nthe $a_{1g}$ state, while the renormalization in $e_g'$ states is about a\nfactor of 2--3 weaker. Our theoretical Neel temperature $\\sim700$~K is in\nreasonable agreement with experimental observations. SrRu$_2$O$_6$ is a unique\nsystem in which localized and itinerant electrons coexist with the proximity to\nan orbitally-selective Mott transition within the $t_{2g}$ sector.\n", "  In recent years enormous progress has been made in perturbative quantum field\ntheory by applying methods of algebraic geometry to parametric Feynman\nintegrals for scalar theories. The transition to gauge theories is complicated\nnot only by the fact that their parametric integrand is much larger and more\ninvolved. It is, moreover, only implicitly given as the result of certain\ndifferential operators applied to the scalar integrand\n$\\exp(-\\Phi_{\\Gamma}/\\Psi_{\\Gamma})$, where $\\Psi_{\\Gamma}$ and $\\Phi_{\\Gamma}$\nare the Kirchhoff and Symanzik polynomials of the Feynman graph $\\Gamma$. In\nthe case of quantum electrodynamics we find that the full parametric integrand\ninherits a rich combinatorial structure from $\\Psi_{\\Gamma}$ and\n$\\Phi_{\\Gamma}$. In the end, it can be expressed explicitly as a sum over\nproducts of new types of graph polynomials which have a combinatoric\ninterpretation via simple cycle subgraphs of $\\Gamma$.\n", "  We prove the renormalizability of a gauge-invariant, four-dimensional GFT\nmodel on SU(2), whose defining interactions correspond to necklace bubbles\n(found also in the context of new large-N expansions of tensor models), rather\nthan melonic ones, which are not renormalizable in this case. The respective\nscaling of different interactions in the vicinity of the Gaussian fixed point\nis determined by the renormalization group itself. This is possible because the\nappropriate notion of canonical dimension of the GFT coupling constants takes\ninto account the detailed combinatorial structure of the individual interaction\nterms. This is one more instance of the peculiarity (and greater mathematical\nrichness) of GFTs with respect to ordinary local quantum field theories. We\nalso explore the renormalization group flow of the model at the\nnon-perturbative level, using functional renormalization group methods, and\nidentify a non-trivial fixed point in various truncations. This model is\nexpected to have a similar structure of divergences as the GFT models of 4d\nquantum gravity, thus paving the way to more detailed investigations on them.\n", "  The statics and dynamics of a stable, mobile three-dimensional (3D)\nspatiotemporal vortex light bullet in a cubic-quintic nonlinear medium with a\nfocusing cubic nonlinearity above a critical value and any defocusing quintic\nnonlinearity is considered. The present study is based on an analytic\nvariational approximation and a full numerical solution of the 3D nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. The 3D vortex bullet can propagate with a constant\nvelocity. Stability of the vortex bullet is established numerically and\nvariationally. The collision between two vortex bullets moving along the\nangular momentum axis is considered. At large velocities the collision is quasi\nelastic with the bullets emerging after collision with practically no\ndistortion. At small velocities two bullets coalesce to form a single entity\ncalled a breather.\n", "  While in the case of zero offset data with horizontal beds, it is clear that\nthe recorded trace is a convolution of the wavelet and reflectivity series, the\nsituation in the case of finite offset is a bit more complex as the direction\nof the incident ray is not vertical, the natural direction in which the\nreflectivity series is measured.We examine the consequences of this hitherto\nneglected fact.\n", "  We study two coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains system, which is shown\nto contain rich quantum phases associated with topological invariants protected\nby symmetries. In the weak coupling region, the system supports two non-trivial\ntopological insulating phases, characterized by winding number N = +1 or -1,\nand two types of edge states. The boundary between the two topological phases\narises from two band closing points, which exhibit topological characteristics\nin one-dimensional k space. By mapping Bloch states on a vector field in k\nspace, the band degenerate points correspond to a pair of kinks of the field,\nwith opposite topological charges. Two topological nodal points move and merge\nas the inter-chain coupling strength varies. This topological invariant is\nprotected by the translational and inversion symmetries, rather than the\nantiunitary operation. Furthermore, we find that when a pair of nodal points is\ncreated, a second order quantum phase transition (QPT) occurs, associating with\na gap closing and spontaneously symmetry breaking. This simple model\ndemonstrates several central concepts in the field of quantum materials and\nprovides a theoretical connection between them.\n", "  Active systems on curved geometries are ubiquitous in the living world. In\nthe presence of curvature orientationally ordered polar flocks are forced to be\ninhomogeneous, often requiring the presence of topological defects even in the\nsteady state due to the constraints imposed by the topology of the underlying\nsurface. In the presence of spontaneous flow the system additionally supports\nlong-wavelength propagating sound modes which get gapped by the curvature of\nthe underlying substrate. We analytically compute the steady state profile of\nan active polar flock on a two-sphere and a catenoid, and show that curvature\nand active flow together result in symmetry protected topological modes that\nget localized to special geodesics on the surface (the equator or the neck\nrespectively). These modes are the analogue of edge states in electronic\nquantum Hall systems and provide unidirectional channels for information\ntransport in the flock, robust against disorder and backscattering.\n", "  Dielectric microstructures have generated much interest in recent years as a\nmeans of accelerating charged particles when powered by solid state lasers. The\nacceleration gradient (or particle energy gain per unit length) is an important\nfigure of merit. To design structures with high acceleration gradients, we\nexplore the adjoint variable method, a highly efficient technique used to\ncompute the sensitivity of an objective with respect to a large number of\nparameters. With this formalism, the sensitivity of the acceleration gradient\nof a dielectric structure with respect to its entire spatial permittivity\ndistribution is calculated by the use of only two full-field electromagnetic\nsimulations, the original and adjoint. The adjoint simulation corresponds\nphysically to the reciprocal situation of a point charge moving through the\naccelerator gap and radiating. Using this formalism, we perform numerical\noptimizations aimed at maximizing acceleration gradients, which generate\nfabricable structures of greatly improved performance in comparison to\npreviously examined geometries.\n", "  Non-classical correlations arising in complex quantum networks are attracting\ngrowing interest, both from a fundamental perspective and for potential\napplications in information processing. In particular, in an entanglement\nswapping scenario a new kind of correlations arise, the so-called nonbilocal\ncorrelations that are incompatible with local realism augmented with the\nassumption that the sources of states used in the experiment are independent.\nIn practice, however, bilocality tests impose strict constraints on the\nexperimental setup and in particular to presence of shared reference frames\nbetween the parties. Here, we experimentally address this point showing that\nfalse positive nonbilocal quantum correlations can be observed even though the\nsources of states are independent. To overcome this problem, we propose and\ndemonstrate a new scheme for the violation of bilocality that does not require\nshared reference frames and thus constitute an important building block for\nfuture investigations of quantum correlations in complex networks.\n", "  The nonsingular bounce models usually suffer from the ghost or gradient\ninstabilities, as has been proved recently. In this paper, we propose a\ncovariant effective theory for stable nonsingular bounce, which has the\nquadratic order of the second order derivative of the field $\\phi$ but the\nbackground set only by $P(\\phi,X)$. With it, we explicitly construct a fully\nstable nonsingular bounce model for the ekpyrotic scenario.\n", "  This review presents an entry-level introduction to topological quantum\ncomputation -- quantum computing with anyons. We introduce anyons at the\nsystem-independent level of anyon models and discuss the key concepts of\nprotected fusion spaces and statistical quantum evolutions for encoding and\nprocessing quantum information. Both the encoding and the processing are\ninherently resilient against errors due to their topological nature, thus\npromising to overcome one of the main obstacles for the realisation of quantum\ncomputers. We outline the general steps of topological quantum computation, as\nwell as discuss various challenges faced by it. We also review the literature\non condensed matter systems where anyons can emerge. Finally, the appearance of\nanyons and employing them for quantum computation is demonstrated in the\ncontext of a simple microscopic model -- the topological superconducting\nnanowire -- that describes the low-energy physics of several experimentally\nrelevant settings. This model supports localised Majorana zero modes that are\nthe simplest and the experimentally most tractable types of anyons that are\nneeded to perform topological quantum computation.\n", "  A star burns its nuclear fuel and balances gravitation by the pressure of the\nheated gas, during its active lifetime. After the exhaustion of the nuclear\nfuel, a low mass star finds peace as a {\\em white dwarf}, where the pressure\nsupport against gravitation is provided by Fermi-degenerate electrons. However,\nfor massive stars the gravitational squeeze becomes so severe that in the final\nphase of evolution, the average density approximately equals the nuclear\ndensity. At such densities most of the protons combine with electrons to\nconvert themselves into neutrons. A {\\em Neutron star}, composed of such\nneutron-rich material, is host to some fascinating physics arising out of its\namazingly compact state of matter (where a solar mass is packed inside a sphere\nof radius $\\sim$ 10Km).\n", "  Lorentz-violating theories of gravity typically contain constrained vector\nfields. We show that the lowest-order coupling of such vectors to\n$\\mathrm{U}(1)$-symmetric scalars can naturally give rise to baryogenesis in a\nmanner akin to the Affleck-Dine mechanism. We calculate the cosmology of this\nnew mechanism, demonstrating that a net $B-L$ can be generated in the early\nUniverse, and that the resulting baryon-to-photon ratio matches that which is\npresently observed. We discuss constraints on the model using solar system and\nastrophysical tests of Lorentz violation in the gravity sector. Generic\nLorentz-violating theories can give rise to the observed matter-antimatter\nasymmetry without violating any current bounds.\n", "  The in-medium property of the axial-vector coupling constant $g_A$ in nuclei\nand dense baryonic matter, a long standing problem in nuclear physics, is\nreformulated in terms of the recently constructed scale-invariant hidden local\nsymmetric ($bs$HLS) Lagrangian that encompasses the physics of baryon density\nranging from nuclear matter $n_0$ to that of massive compact stars, $\\sim\n6n_0$. It is shown that unlike the pion decay constant $f_\\pi$ that slides with\nthe vacuum change induced by, and dropping with, increasing density, the\naxial-current constant $g_A$ should remain more or less unaffected by the\ndecrease of chiral condensate in nuclear Gamow-Teller transitions (involving\nthe space component of the axial current) whereas it gets strongly enhanced in\naxial-charge transitions (involving the time component of the axial current) as\ndensity increases. This phenomenon confirms the \"chiral filter hypothesis\"\ninferred from the current algebras in 1970's. These phenomena can be taken as a\n\"nuclear physics proof\" of Weinberg's folk theorem on quantum effective field\ntheories. The implications of these predictions on giant Gamow-Teller\nresonances in nuclei and on first-forbidden beta transitions (relevant to\nnuclear astrophysical processes) are discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we report on new experimental results on the effects of\nin-plane surface stretching on the friction of Poly(DiMethylSiloxane) (PDMS)\nrubber with smooth rigid probes. Friction-induced displacement fields are\nmeasured at the surface of the PDMS substrate under steady-state sliding. Then,\nthe corresponding contact pressure and frictional stress distributions are\ndetermined from an inversion procedure. Using this approach, we show that the\nlocal frictional stress $\\tau$ is proportional to the local stretch ratio\n$\\lambda$ at the rubber surface. Additional data using a triangular flat punch\nindicate that $\\tau(\\lambda)$ relationship is independent on the contact\ngeometry. From friction experiments using pre-stretched PDMS substrate, it is\nalso found that the stretch-dependence of the frictional stress is isotropic,\ni.e. it does not depend on the angle between stretching and sliding directions.\nPotential physical explanations for this phenomenon are provided within the\nframework of Schallamach's friction model. Although the present experiments are\ndealing with smooth contact interfaces, the reported $\\tau(\\lambda)$ dependence\nis also relevant to the friction of statistically rough contact interfaces,\nwhile not accounted for in related contact mechanics models.\n", "  We employ machine learning techniques to investigate the volume minimum of\nSasaki-Einstein base manifolds of non-compact toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We find\nthat the minimum volume can be approximated via a second order multiple linear\nregression on standard topological quantities obtained from the corresponding\ntoric diagram. The approximation improves further after invoking a\nconvolutional neural network with the full toric diagram of the Calabi-Yau\n3-folds as the input. We are thereby able to circumvent any minimization\nprocedure that was previously necessary and find an explicit mapping between\nthe minimum volume and the topological quantities of the toric diagram. Under\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence, the minimum volumes of Sasaki-Einstein manifolds\ncorrespond to central charges of a class of 4d N=1 superconformal field\ntheories. We therefore find empirical evidence for a function that gives values\nof central charges without the usual extremization procedure.\n", "  These lecture notes discuss classical models of liquid crystals, and the\ndifferent ways in which defects are described according to the different\nmodels.\n", "  In this short review, we discuss the approach of the commutator algebra of\ncovariant derivative to analyse the gravitational theories, starting from the\nstandard Einstein's general theory of relativity and focusing on the Rastall\ntheory. After that, we discuss the important role of the torsion in this\nmathematical framework. In the Appendix of the paper we analyse the importance\nof the nascent gravitational wave astronomy as a tool to discriminate among the\ngeneral theory of relativity and alternative theories of gravity.\n", "  We use a van-der-Waals pickup technique to fabricate different\nheterostructures containing WSe$_2$(WS$_2$) and graphene. The heterostructures\nwere structured by plasma etching, contacted by one-dimensional edge contacts\nand a topgate was deposited. For graphene/WSe$_2$/SiO$_2$ samples we observe\nmobilities of $\\sim$12 000 cm$^2$/Vs. Magnetic field dependent resistance\nmeasurements on these samples show a peak in the conductivity at low magnetic\nfield. This dip is attributed to the weak antilocalization (WAL) effect,\nstemming from spin-orbit coupling. Samples where graphene is encapsulated\nbetween WSe$_2$(WS$_2$) and hBN show a much higher mobility of up to $\\sim$120\n000 cm$^2$/Vs. However, in these samples no WAL peak can be observed. We\nattribute this to a transition from the diffusive to the quasiballistic regime.\nAt low magnetic field a resistance peak appears, which we ascribe to a size\neffect, due to boundary scattering. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in fully\nencapsulated samples show all integer filling factors, due to complete lifting\nof the spin and valley degeneracy.\n", "  A precise, accurate, and relatively straightforward in-situ method to measure\nand control the ellipticity of light resonantly interacting with an atomic\nvapor is described. The technique can be used to minimize vector light shifts.\nThe method involves measurement of ellipticity-induced resonances in the\nmagnetic-field dependence of nonlinear magneto-optical rotation of\nfrequency-modulated light. The light propagation direction is orthogonal to the\napplied magnetic field $\\textbf{B}$ and the major axis of the light\npolarization ellipse is along $\\textbf{B}$. When the light modulation frequency\nmatches the Larmor frequency, elliptically polarized light produces precessing\natomic spin orientation transverse to $\\textbf{B}$ via synchronous optical\npumping. The precessing spin orientation causes optical rotation oscillating at\nthe Larmor frequency by modulating the atomic vapor's circular birefringence.\nBased on this technique's precision, in-situ nature (which avoids systematic\nerrors arising from optical interfaces), and independent control of the most\nimportant systematic errors, it is shown that the accuracy of light ellipticity\nmeasurements achievable with this technique can exceed that of existing methods\nby orders of magnitude.\n", "  The space based interferometer LISA will be capable of detecting the\ngravitational waves emitted by stellar mass black holes or neutron stars slowly\ninspiralling into the supermassive black holes found in the centre of most\ngalaxies. The gravitational wave signal from such an extreme mass ratio\ninspiral (EMRI) event will provide a unique opportunity to test whether the\nspacetime metric around the central black hole is well described by the Kerr\nsolution. In this paper a well studied model for EMRIs around Kerr black holes\nis extended to a family of parametrically deformed bumpy black holes which\npreserve the basic symmetries of the Kerr metric. The new EMRI model is then\nused to quantify the constraints that LISA observations of EMRIs may be able to\nplace on the deviations, or bumps, on the Kerr metric.\n", "  In a recent paper [A. Alberucci, C. Jisha, N. Smyth, and G. Assanto, Phys.\nRev. A 91, 013841 (2015)], Alberucci et al. have studied the propagation of\nbright spatial solitary waves in highly nonlocal media. We find that the main\nresults in that and related papers, concerning soliton shape and dynamics,\nbased on the accessible soliton (AS) approximation, are incorrect; the correct\nresults have already been published by others. These and other inconsistencies\nin the paper follow from the problems in applying the AS approximation in\nearlier papers by the group that propagated to the later papers. The accessible\nsoliton theory cannot describe accurately the features and dynamics of solitons\nin highly nonlocal media.\n", "  In this paper, we deal with the $f(R,Q)$ gravity whose action depends,\nbesides of the scalar curvature $R$, on the higher-derivative invariant\n$Q=R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu}$. In order to compare this theory with the usual\nGeneral Relativity (GR), we verify the consistency of G\\\"{o}del-type solutions\nwithin the $f(R,Q)$ gravity and discuss the related causality issues.\nExplicitly, we show that in the $f(R,Q)$ gravity there are new G\\\"{o}del-type\ncompletely causal solutions having no analogue in the general relativity. In\nparticular, a remarkable G\\\"{o}del-type solution corresponding to the\nconformally flat space and maximally symmetric for physically well-motivated\nmatter sources, with no necessity of cosmological constant, has been\nconsidered. We demonstrate that, in contrast to GR framework, $f(R,Q)$ gravity\nsupports new vacuum solutions with the requirement for the cosmological\nconstant to be non-zero. Finally, causal solutions are obtained for a\nparticular choice $f(R,Q)=R+\\alpha R^2+ \\beta Q$.\n", "  Linear perturbation theory is a powerful toolkit for studying black hole\nspacetimes. However, the perturbation equations are hard to solve unless we can\nuse separation of variables. In the Kerr spacetime, metric perturbations do not\nseparate, but curvature perturbations do. The cost of curvature perturbations\nis a very complicated metric-reconstruction procedure. This procedure can be\navoided using a symmetry-adapted choice of basis functions in highly symmetric\nspacetimes, such as near-horizon extremal Kerr. In this paper, we focus on this\nspacetime, and (i) construct the symmetry-adapted basis functions; (ii) show\ntheir orthogonality; and (iii) show that they lead to separation of variables\nof the scalar, Maxwell, and metric perturbation equations. This separation\nturns the system of partial differential equations into one of ordinary\ndifferential equations over a compact domain, the polar angle.\n", "  We present some basic integer arithmetic quantum circuits, such as adders and\nmultipliers-accumulators of various forms, as well as diagonal operators, which\noperate on multilevel qudits. The integers to be processed are represented in\nan alternative basis after they have been Fourier transformed. Several\narithmetic circuits operating on Fourier transformed integers have appeared in\nthe literature for two level qubits. Here we extend these techniques on\nmultilevel qudits, as they may offer some advantages relative to qubits\nimplementations. The arithmetic circuits presented can be used as basic\nbuilding blocks for higher level algorithms such as quantum phase estimation,\nquantum simulation, quantum optimization etc., but they can also be used in the\nimplementation of a quantum fractional Fourier transform as it is shown in a\ncompanion work presented separately.\n", "  The recently established metric reduction in generalized geometry is encoded\nin 0-dimensional supersymmetric $\\sigma$-models. This is an example of balanced\ntopological field theories. To find the geometric content of such models, the\nreduction of Bismut connections is studies in detail. Generalized\nK$\\ddot{a}$hler reduction is briefly revisited in this formalism and the\ngeneralized K$\\ddot{a}$hler geometry on the moduli space of instantons on a\ngeneralized K$\\ddot{a}$hler 4-manifold of even type is thus explained formally\nin a topological field theoretic way.\n", "  Spin excitations in the overdoped high temperature superconductors\nTl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+\\delta}$ and (Bi,Pb)$_2$(Sr,La)$_{2}$CuO$_{6+\\delta}$ were\ninvestigated by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) as functions of\ndoping and detuning of the incoming photon energy above the Cu-$L_3$ absorption\npeak. The RIXS spectra at optimal doping are dominated by a paramagnon feature\nwith peak energy independent of photon energy, similar to prior results on\nunderdoped cuprates. Beyond optimal doping, the RIXS data indicate a sharp\ncrossover to a regime with a strong contribution from incoherent particle/hole\nexcitations whose maximum shows a fluorescence-like shift upon detuning. The\nspectra of both compound families are closely similar, and their salient\nfeatures are reproduced by exact-diagonalization calculations of the\nsingle-band Hubbard model on a finite cluster. The results are discussed in the\nlight of recent transport experiments indicating a quantum phase transition\nnear optimal doping.\n", "  The family of materials defined as ZrSiX (X = S, Se, Te) has been established\nas Dirac node-line semimetals, and subsequent study is urgent to exploit the\npromising application of unusual magnetoresistance property. In this work, we\nsystematically investigated the anisotropic magnetoresistance in the\nnewly-discovered Dirac node-line material ZrSiSe. By applying a magnetic field\nof 3 T by a vector field, the three-dimensional (3D) magnetoresistance (MR)\nshows strong anisotropy. The MR ratio of maximum and minimum directions can\nreach 7 at 3 T and keeps increasing at the higher magnetic field. The\nanisotropic MR forms a butterfly-shaped curve, which indicates the quasi-2D\nelectronic structures. This is further confirmed by the angular-dependent\nShubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations. The first-principles calculations\nestablish the quasi-2D tubular-shaped Fermi surface near the X point in the\nBrillouin zone. Our findings shed light on the 3D mapping of MR and the\npotential applications in magnetic sensors based on ZrSiSe Dirac materials.\n", "  The manipulation and control of vortex states in superconducting systems are\nof great interest in view of possible applications, for which mesoscopic\nmaterials are good candidates. In this work, we studied the annihilation\ndynamics and the dissipative aspects of an Abrikosov's vortex-antivortex pair\nin a mesoscopic superconducting system with a concentric hole. The generalized\ntime-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations were numerically solved. The main\nresult is the appearance of a phase slip-like line due to the elongation of the\nvortex and antivortex cores. Under specific circumstances, thermal dissipation\nmight be associated with a sizeable relaxation of the order parameter, so that\nthe energy released in the annihilation of a vortex-antivortex pair might\nbecome detectable in measurements of the magnetization as a function of time.\n", "  We study theoretically the velocity cross-correlations of a viscous fluid\nconfined in a slit between two viscoelastic media. We analyze the effect of\nthese correlations on the motions of particles suspended in the fluid. The\ncompliance of the confining boundaries gives rise to a long-ranged pair\ncorrelation, decaying only as $1/r$ with the interparticle distance $r$. We\nshow how this long-ranged effect may be used to extract the viscoelastic\nproperties of the confining media without embedding tracer particles in them.\nWe discuss the remarkable robustness of such a potential technique with respect\nto details of the confinement, and its expected statistical advantages over\nstandard two-point microrheology.\n", "  Quantum correlated, highly non-degenerate photons can be used to synthesize\ndisparate quantum nodes and link quantum processing over incompatible\nwavelengths, thereby constructing heterogeneous quantum systems for otherwise\nunattainable superior performance. Existing techniques for correlated photons\nhave been concentrated in the visible and near-IR domains, with the photon\npairs residing within one octave. Here, we demonstrate direct generation and\ndetection of high-purity photon pairs at room temperature that are four octaves\napart, one at 780 nm to match the rubidium D2 line, and the other at 3950 nm\nthat falls in a transparent, low-scattering optical window for free space\napplications. The pairs are created via spontaneous parametric downconversion\nin a lithium niobate waveguide with specially designed geometry and periodic\npoling. The 780 nm photons are measured with a silicon avalanche photodiode,\nand the 3950 nm photons are measured with an upconversion photon detector using\na similar waveguide, which attains 34% internal conversion efficiency. Quantum\ncorrelation measurement yields a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 54,\nwhich indicates the strong correlation with the extremely non-degenerate photon\npairs. Our system bridges existing quantum technology to the challenging mid-IR\nregime, where unprecedented applications are expected in metrology, sensing,\ncommunications, medical diagnostics, and so on.\n", "  At high magnetic fields the conductance of graphene is governed by the\nhalf-integer quantum Hall effect. By local electrostatic gating a \\textit{p-n}\njunction perpendicular to the graphene edges can be formed, along which quantum\nHall channels co-propagate. It has been predicted by Tworzid\\l{}o and\nco-workers that if only the lowest Landau level is filled on both sides of the\njunction, the conductance is determined by the valley (isospin) polarization at\nthe edges and by the width of the flake. This effect remained hidden so far due\nto scattering between the channels co-propagating along the \\textit{p-n}\ninterface (equilibration). Here we investigate \\textit{p-n} junctions in\nencapsulated graphene with a movable \\textit{p-n} interface with which we are\nable to probe the edge-configuration of graphene flakes. We observe large\nquantum conductance oscillations on the order of \\si{e^2/h} which solely depend\non the \\textit{p-n} junction position providing the first signature of\nisospin-defined conductance. Our experiments are underlined by quantum\ntransport calculations.\n", "  We investigate the mechanical properties of amorphous polymers by means of\ncoarse-grained simulations and nonaffine lattice dynamics theory. A small\nincrease of polymer chain bending stiffness leads first to softening of the\nmaterial, while hardening happens only upon further strengthening of the\nbackbones. This nonmonotonic variation of the storage modulus $G'$ with bending\nstiffness is caused by a competition between additional resistance to\ndeformation offered by stiffer backbones and decreased density of the material\ndue to a necessary decrease in monomer-monomer coordination. This\ncounter-intuitive finding suggests that the strength of polymer glasses may in\nsome circumstances be enhanced by softening the bending of constituent chains.\n", "  We derive expressions for the cross section of the multiparton interactions\nbased on the analysis of the relevant Feynman diagrams. We express the cross\nsections through the double (triple, ...) generalized parton distributions\n(GPDs). In the mean field approximation for the double GPDs the answer is\nexpressed through the integral over two gluon form factor which was measured in\nthe exclusive DIS vector meson production.We explain under what conditions the\nderived expressions correspond to an intuitive picture of hard interactions in\nthe impact parameter representation. The mean field approximation in which\ncorrelations of the partons are neglected fail to explain the data, while pQCD\ninduced correlation enhance large $p_\\perp$ and $ 0.001 < x < 0.1$ typically\nenhance the cross section by a factor of 1.5 -- 2 explaining the current data.\nWe argue that in the small x kinematics ($10^{-4} \\le x \\le 10^{-3}$) where\neffects of perturbative correlations diminish, the nonperturbative mechanism\nkicks in and generates positive correlations comparable in magnitude with the\nperturbative ones. We explain how our technique can be used for calculations of\nMPI in the proton - nucleus scattering. The interplay of hard interactions and\nunderlying event is discussed, as well as different geometric pictures for each\nof MPI mechanisms-pQCD, nonperturbative correlations and mean field.\nPredictions for value of \\effs for various processes and a wide range of\nkinematics are given. We show that together different MPI mechanisms give good\ndescription of experimental data, both at Tvatron, and LHC, including the\ncentral kinematics studied by ATLAS and CMS detectors, and forward (heavy\nflavors) kinematics studied by LHCb.\n", "  In this paper we present the comparison of experiments and numerical\nsimulations for bubble cutting by a wire. The air bubble is surrounded by\nwater. In the experimental setup an air bubble is injected on the bottom of a\nwater column. When the bubble rises and contacts the wire, it is separated into\ntwo daughter bubbles. The flow is modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations. A meshfree method is used to simulate the bubble cutting. We have\nobserved that the experimental and numerical results are in very good\nagreement. Moreover, we have further presented simulation results for liquid\nwith higher viscosity. In this case the numerical results are close to\npreviously published results.\n", "  The bathtub model of the star forming interstellar medium is based on the\npowerful constraint that mass has to be conserved when gas flows through its\nvarious thermal and density phases, ending up eventually in a young star or\nbeing blown away by stellar feedback. It predicts that the star formation rate\nof a molecular cloud is not determined by the cloud's mass or its internal\ncollapse timescale, but rather by the accretion rate of new gas. For the most\nsimple case of a constant accretion flow an equilibrium state is reached\nquickly where the star formation rate equals the accretion rate and where the\ndense gas mass is constant and independent of time. The mass of the young star\ncluster, on the other hand, increases linearly with time. The stellar mass\nfraction therefore represents a sensitive clock to measure the age of the\nstar-forming region. The bathtub model predicts that the efficiency of star\nformation is small, of order 1%, even in the dense filamentary phases of\nmolecular clouds. It provides a simple explanation for the dense gas fraction\nof order 10% in molecular clouds and for the large gas depletion timescales of\nstar-forming galaxies of order $5 \\times 10^8 - 10^9$ yrs.\n", "  The neutrino flux at Earth is dominated in the keV energy range by the\nneutrinos produced in the Sun through thermal processes, namely photo\nproduction, bremsstrahlung, plasmon decay, and emission in free-bound and\nbound-bound transitions of partially ionized elements heavier than hydrogen and\nhelium. Such a component of the neutrino flux is conspicuously absent from\npopular analyses of the all-sources spectrum at Earth, whereas if detected it\ncould be a source of information about solar physics. Moreover, it would be the\nrelevant background for keV-mass sterile neutrino dark matter direct searches.\n", "  We use the nuclear spin coherence of $^{31}$P donors in $^{28}$Si to\ndetermine flip-flop rates of donor electron spins. Isotopically purified\n$^{28}$Si crystals minimize the number of $^{29}$Si flip-flops, and\nmeasurements at 1.7 K suppress electron spin relaxation. The crystals have\ndonor concentrations ranging from $1.2\\times10^{14}$ to\n$3.3\\times10^{15}~\\text{P/cm}^3$, allowing us to detect how electron flip-flop\nrates change with donor density. We also simulate how electron spin flip-flops\ncan cause nuclear spin decoherence. We find that when these flip-flops are the\nprimary cause of decoherence, Hahn echo decays have a stretched exponential\nform. For our two higher donor density crystals ($> 10^{15}~\\text{P/cm}^3$),\nthere is excellent agreement between simulations and experiments. In lower\ndensity crystals ($< 10^{15}~\\text{P/cm}^3$), there is no longer agreement\nbetween simulations and experiments, suggesting a different, unknown mechanism\nis limiting nuclear spin coherence. The nuclear spin coherence in the lowest\ndensity crystal ($1.2 \\times 10^{14}~\\text{P/cm}^3$) allows us to place upper\nbounds on the magnitude of noise sources in bulk crystals such as electric\nfield fluctuations that may degrade silicon quantum devices.\n", "  Digital information can be encoded in the building-block sequence of\nmacromolecules, such as RNA and single-stranded DNA. Methods of \"writing\" and\n\"reading\" macromolecular strands are currently available, but they are slow and\nexpensive. In an ideal molecular data storage system, routine operations such\nas write, read, erase, store, and transfer must be done reliably and at high\nspeed within an integrated chip. As a first step toward demonstrating the\nfeasibility of this concept, we report preliminary results of DNA readout\nexperiments conducted in miniaturized chambers that are scalable to even\nsmaller dimensions. We show that translocation of a single-stranded DNA\nmolecule (consisting of 50 adenosine bases followed by 100 cytosine bases)\nthrough an ion-channel yields a characteristic signal that is attributable to\nthe 2-segment structure of the molecule.

All players accept the offer. However, due to the\npossibility of unforeseen circumstances, each player has a fixed probability of\nbeing unable to participate in the game, unlike similar models which assume\nvoluntary participation. We first study how prescribed stochastic opting-out\naffects cooperation in finite populations. Moreover, in the model, cooperation\nis favored by natural selection over both neutral drift and defection if return\non investment exceeds a threshold value defined solely by the population size,\ngame size, and a player's probability of opting-out. Ultimately, increasing the\nprobability that each player is unable to fulfill her promise of participating\nin the public goods game facilitates natural selection of cooperators. We also\nuse adaptive dynamics to study the coevolution of cooperation and opting-out\nbehavior. However, given rare mutations minutely different from the original\npopulation, an analysis based on adaptive dynamics suggests that the over time\nthe population will tend towards complete defection and non-participation, and\nsubsequently, from there, participating cooperators will stand a chance to\nemerge by neutral drift. Nevertheless, increasing the probability of\nnon-participation decreases the rate at which the population tends towards\ndefection when participating. Our work sheds light on understanding how\nstochastic opting-out emerges in the first place and its role in the evolution\nof cooperation.\n", "  In this paper, we presented a study of temperature effects on BGO\ncalorimeters using proton MIP's collected in the first year operation of DAMPE.\nBy directly comparing MIP calibration constants used by DAMPE data production\npipe line, we found an experimental relation between temperature and signal\namplitudes of each BGO bar: a general deviation of -1.162%/$^{\\circ}$C,and\n-0.47%/$^{\\circ}$C to -1.60%/$^{\\circ}$C statistically for each detector\nelement. During 2016, DAMPE's temperature changed by about 7 degrees due to\nsolar elevation angle and the corresponding energy scale bias is about 8%. By\nfrequent MIP calibration operation, this kind of bias is eliminated to an\nacceptable value.\n", "  Simulations play a vital role in testing and validating HI 21-cm power\nspectrum estimation techniques. Conventional methods use techniques like N-body\nsimulations to simulate the sky signal which is then passed through a model of\nthe instrument. This makes it necessary to simulate the HI distribution in a\nlarge cosmological volume, and incorporate both the light-cone effect and the\ntelescope's chromatic response. The computational requirements may be\nparticularly large if one wishes to simulate many realizations of the signal.\nIn this paper we present an analytical method to simulate the HI visibility\nsignal. This is particularly efficient if one wishes to simulate a large number\nof realizations of the signal. Our method is based on theoretical predictions\nof the visibility correlation which incorporate both the light-cone effect and\nthe telescope's chromatic response. We have demonstrated this method by\napplying it to simulate the HI visibility signal for the upcoming Ooty Wide\nField Array Phase I.\n", "  We present medium-resolution (R~7000) near-infrared echelle spectroscopic\ndata for 36 MYSOs drawn from the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey. This is the\nlargest sample observed at this resolution at these wavelengths of MYSOs to\ndate. The spectra are characterized mostly by emission from hydrogen\nrecombination lines and accretion diagnostic lines. One MYSO shows photospheric\nHI absorption, a comparison with spectral standards indicates that the star is\nan A type star with a low surface gravity, implying that the MYSOs are probably\nswollen, as also suggested by evolutionary calculations. An investigation of\nthe Br$\\gamma$ line profiles shows that most are in pure emission, while\n13$\\pm$5 % display P Cygni profiles, indicative of outflow, while less than\n8$\\pm$4 % have inverse P Cygni profiles, indicative of infall. These values are\ncomparable with investigations into the optically bright Herbig Be stars, but\nnot with those of Herbig Ae and T Tauri stars, consistent with the notion that\nthe more massive stars undergo accretion in a different fashion than lower mass\nobjects which are undergoing magnetospheric accretion. Accretion luminosities\nand rates as derived from the Br$\\gamma$ line luminosities agree with results\nfor lower mass sources, providing tentative evidence for massive star formation\ntheories based on scaling of low-mass scenarios. We present Br$\\gamma$/Br12\nline profile ratios exploiting the fact that optical depth effects can be\ntraced as a function of Doppler shift across the lines. These show that the\nwinds of MYSOs in this sample are nearly equally split between constant,\naccelerating, and decelerating velocity structures. There are no trends between\nthe types of features we see and bolometric luminosities or near-infrared\ncolours.\n", "  Single layers of transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS$_2$ are direct\nbandgap semiconductors with optical and electronic properties distinct from\nmultilayers due to strong vertical confinement. Despite the fundamental\nmonolayer limit of thickness, the electronic structure of isolated layers can\nbe further tailored with lateral degrees of freedom in nanostructures such as\nquantum dots or nanoribbons. Although one-dimensionally confined monolayer\nsemiconductors are predicted to have interesting size- and edge-dependent\nproperties useful for spintronics applications, experiments on the\nopto-electronic features of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide\nnanoribbons is limited. We use nanolithography to create monolayer MoS$_2$\nnanoribbons with lateral sizes down to 20 nm. The Raman spectra show\npolarization anisotropy and size-dependent intensity. The nanoribbons prepared\nwith this technique show reduced susceptibility to edge defects and emit\nphotoluminescence with size-dependent energy that can be understood from a\nphenomenological model. Fabrication of monolayer nanoribbons with strong\nexciton emission can facilitate exploration of low-dimensional opto-electronic\ndevices with controllable properties.\n", "  In the framework of multi-body dynamics, successive encounters with a third\nbody, even if well outside of its sphere of influence, can noticeably alter the\ntrajectory of a spacecraft. Examples of these effects have already been\nexploited by past missions such as SMART-1, as well as are proposed to benefit\nfuture missions to Jupiter, Saturn or Neptune, and disposal strategies from\nEarth's High Eccentric or Libration Point Orbits. This paper revises three\ntotally different descriptions of the effects of the third body gravitational\nperturbation. These are the averaged dynamics of the classical third body\nperturbing function, the Opik's close encounter theory and the Keplerian map\napproach. The first two techniques have respectively been applied to the cases\nof a spacecraft either always remaining very far or occasionally experiencing\nextremely close approaches to the third body. However, the paper also seeks\nsolutions for trajectories that undergo one or more close approaches at\ndistances in the order of the sphere of influence of the third body. The paper\nattempts to gain insight into the accuracy of these different perturbative\ntechniques into each of these scenarios, as compared with the motion in the\nCircular Restricted Three Body Problem.\n", "  Given a time-evolving network, how can we detect communities over periods of\nhigh internal and low external interactions? To address this question we\ngeneralize traditional local community detection in graphs to the setting of\ndynamic networks. Adopting existing static-network approaches in an\n\"aggregated\" graph of all temporal interactions is not appropriate for the\nproblem as dynamic communities may be short-lived and thus lost when mixing\ninteractions over long periods. Hence, dynamic community mining requires the\ndetection of both the community nodes and an optimal time interval in which\nthey are actively interacting.\n  We propose a filter-and-verify framework for dynamic community detection. To\nscale to long intervals of graph evolution, we employ novel spectral bounds for\ndynamic community conductance and employ them to filter suboptimal periods in\nnear-linear time. We also design a time-and-graph-aware locality sensitive\nhashing family to effectively spot promising community cores. Our method PHASR\ndiscovers communities of consistently higher quality (2 to 67 times better)\nthan those of baselines. At the same time, our bounds allow for pruning between\n$55\\%$ and $95\\%$ of the search space, resulting in significant savings in\nrunning time compared to exhaustive alternatives for even modest time intervals\nof graph evolution.\n", "  Multi-wavelength astronomical studies brings a wealth of science within\nreach. One way to achieve a cross-wavelength analysis is via `stacking', i.e.\ncombining precise positional information from an image at one wavelength with\ndata from one at another wavelength in order to extract source-flux\ndistributions and other derived quantities. For the first time we extend\nstacking to include the effects of confusion. We develop our algorithm in a\nfully Bayesian framework and apply it to the Square Kilometre Array Design\nStudy (SKADS) simulation in order to extract galaxy number counts. Previous\nstudies have shown that recovered source counts are highly biased high when\nconfusion is non-negligible. With this new method, source counts are returned\ncorrectly. We also describe a novel estimator for quantifying the impact of\nconfusion on stacking analyses. This method is an essential step in exploiting\nscientific return for upcoming deep radio surveys, e.g. MIGHTEE on MeerKAT.\n", "  Wedge absorbers are needed to obtain longitudinal cooling in ionization\ncooling. They also can be used to obtain emittance exchanges between\nlongitudinal and transverse phase space. There can be large exchanges in\nemittance, even with single wedges. In the present note we explore the use of\nwedge absorbers in the MICE experiment to obtain transverse-longitudinal\nemittance exchanges within present and future operational conditions. The same\nwedge can be used to explore \"direct\" and \"reverse\" emittance exchange\ndynamics, where direct indicates a configuration that reduces momentum spread\nand reverse is a configuration that increases momentum spread. Analytical\nestimated and ICOOL and G4BeamLine simulations of the exchanges at MICE\nparameters are presented. Large exchanges can be obtained in both reverse and\ndirect configurations.\n", "  Optically levitated micro- and nanoparticles offer an ideal playground for\ninvestigating photon-phonon interactions over macroscopic distances. Here we\nreport the observation of long-range optical binding of multiple\nmicroparticles, mediated by intermodal scattering and interference inside the\nevacuated core of a hollow-core photonic crystal fibre (HC-PCF). Three\npolystyrene particles with 1 {\\mu}m diameter are stably bound together with an\ninter-particle distance of ~40 {\\mu}m, or 50 times longer than the wavelength\nof the trapping laser. The bound-particle array can be translated to-and-fro\nover centimetre distances along the fibre. When evacuated to 6 mbar gas\npressure, the collective mechanical modes of the bound-particle array could be\nobserved. The measured inter-particle distance at equilibrium and mechanical\neigen-frequencies are supported by a novel analytical formalism modelling the\ndynamics of the binding process. The HC-PCF system offers a unique platform for\ninvestigating the rich optomechanical dynamics of arrays of levitated particles\nin a well-isolated and protected environment.\n", "  The morphology and dimension of the conductive filament formed in a\nmemristive device are strongly influenced by the thickness of its switching\nmedium layer. Aggressive scaling of this active layer thickness is critical\ntowards reducing the operating current, voltage and energy consumption in\nfilamentary type memristors. Previously, the thickness of this filament layer\nhas been limited to above a few nanometers due to processing constraints,\nmaking it challenging to further suppress the on-state current and the\nswitching voltage. Here, we study the formation of conductive filaments in a\nmaterial medium with sub-nanometer thickness, formed through the oxidation of\natomically-thin two-dimensional boron nitride. The resulting memristive device\nexhibits sub-nanometer filamentary switching with sub-pA operation current and\nfemtojoule per bit energy consumption. Furthermore, by confining the filament\nto the atomic scale, we observe current switching characteristics that are\ndistinct from that in thicker medium due to the profoundly different atomic\nkinetics. The filament morphology in such an aggressively scaled memristive\ndevice is also theoretically explored. These ultra-low energy devices are\npromising for realizing femtojoule and sub-femtojoule electronic computation,\nwhich can be attractive for applications in a wide range of electronics systems\nthat desire ultra-low power operation.\n", "  We have performed density functional theory calculation and tight binging\nanalysis in order to investigate the mechanism for the giant Rashba-type spin\nsplitting (RSS) observed in Bi/Ag(111). We find that local orbital angular\nmomentum induces momentum and spin dependent charge distribution which results\nin spin-dependent hopping. We show that the spin-dependent interatomic-hopping\nin Bi/Ag(111) works as a strong effective field and induces the giant RSS,\nindicating that the giant RSS is driven by hopping, not by a uniform electric\nfield. The effective field from the hopping energy difference amounts to be ~18\nV/{\\AA}. This new perspective on the RSS gives us a hint for the giant RSS\nmechanism in general and should provide a strategy for designing new RSS\nmaterials by controlling spin-dependence of hopping energy between the\nneighboring atomic layers.\n", "  These are the lecture notes of a course taught at the Park City Mathematics\nInstitute in June 2017. They are intended to review some recent results,\nobtained in large part with Thomas Lebl\\'e, on the statistical mechanics of\nsystems of points with logarithmic or Coulomb interactions. After listing some\nmotivations, we describe the \"electric approach\" which allows to get\nconcentration results, Central Limit Theorems for fluctuations, and a Large\nDeviations Principle expressed in terms of the microscopic state of the system.\n", "  In this paper, we develop a thermodynamic perturbation theory to describe the\nself-assembly of patchy colloids which exhibit both patch-patch attractions as\nwell as patch / non-patch attractions. That is, patches attract other patches\nas well as the no patch region. In general these attractions operate on\ndifferent energy scales, which allows for controlled self-assembly as well as\nanomalous phase behavior. As an application we apply the model to the study of\nliquid water.\n", "  Reservoir engineering is the term used in quantum control and information\ntechnologies to describe manipulating the environment within which an open\nquantum system operates. Reservoir engineering is essential in applications\nwhere storing quantum information is required. From the control theory\nperspective, a quantum system is capable of storing quantum information if it\npossesses a so-called decoherence free subsystem (DFS). This paper explores\npole placement techniques to facilitate synthesis of decoherence free\nsubsystems via coherent quantum feedback control. We discuss limitations of the\nconventional `open loop' approach and propose a constructive feedback design\nmethodology for decoherence free subsystem engineering. It captures a quite\ngeneral dynamic coherent feedback structure which allows systems with\ndecoherence free modes to be synthesized from components which do not have such\nmodes.\n", "  We show single photon and electron interferences can be calculated without\nquantum-superposition states by using tensor form (covariant quantization).\nFrom the analysis results, the scalar potential which correspond to an\nindefinite metric vector forms an oscillatory field and causes the\ninterferences. The results clarify the concept of quantum-superposition states\nis not required for the description of the interference, which leads to an\nimproved understanding of the uncertainty principle and resolution of paradox\nof reduction of the wave packet, elimination of infinite zero-point energy and\nderivation of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The results conclude Quantum\ntheory is a kind of deterministic physics without \"probabilistic\ninterpretation\".\n", "  An analytic expression for the incommensurability of static stripes in\nLa_{2-x}Sr_xNiO_{4+y} is given, depending on the hole density n_h = x + 2y.\nApart from geometry factors the formula is the same as for stripes in the\nrelated cuprates La_{2-x}Ae_xCuO_4 (Ae = Sr, Ba). Agreement with experimental\ndata from neutron and X-ray diffraction is good. The stability of stripes is\ninterpreted in terms of the separation of hole charges residing at every\nnu^{th} node of the associated magnetization waves.\n", "  Liquid lead-lithium (Pb-16Li) is of primary interest as one of the candidate\nmaterials for tritium breeder, neutron multiplier and coolant fluid in liquid\nmetal blanket concepts relevant to fusion power plants. For an effective and\nreliable operation of such high temperature liquid metal systems, monitoring\nand control of critical process parameters is essential. However, limited\noperational experience coupled with high temperature operating conditions and\ncorrosive nature of Pb-16Li severely limits application of commercially\navailable diagnostic tools. This paper illustrates indigenous calibration test\nfacility designs and experimental methods used to develop non-contact\nconfiguration level diagnostics using pulse radar level sensor, wetted\nconfiguration pressure diagnostics using diaphragm seal type pressure sensor\nand bulk temperature diagnostics with temperature profiling for high\ntemperature, high pressure liquid Pb and Pb-16Li applications. Calibration\ncheck of these sensors was performed using analytical methods, at temperature\nbetween 380C-400C and pressure upto 1 MPa (g). Reliability and performance\nvalidation were achieved through long duration testing of sensors in liquid Pb\nand liquid Pb-16Li environment for over 1000 hour. Estimated deviation for\nradar level sensor lies within [-3.36 mm, +13.64 mm] and the estimated error\nfor pressure sensor lies within 1.1% of calibrated span over the entire test\nduration. Results obtained and critical observations from these tests are\npresented in this paper.\n", "  It is unmistakably paradoxical that the weakest point of the photoactive\norganic-inorganic hybrid perovskite is its instability against light. Why and\nhow perovskites break down under light irradiation and what happens at the\natomistic level during the degradation still remains unanswered. In this paper,\nwe revealed the fundamental origin and mechanism for irreversible degradation\nof hybrid perovskite materials from our new experimental results and ab initio\nmolecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We found that the photo-generated\ncharges trapped along the grain boundaries of the perovskite crystal result in\noxygen-induced irreversible degradation in air even in the absence of moisture.\nThe present result, together with our previous experimental finding on the same\ncritical role of trapped charges in the perovskite degradation under moisture,\nsuggests that the trapped charges are the main culprit in both the oxygen- and\nmoisture-induced degradation of perovskite materials. More detailed roles of\noxygen and water molecules were investigated by tracking the atomic motions of\nthe oxygen- or water-covered CH3NH3PbI3(MAPbI3) perovskite crystal surface with\ntrapped charges via AIMD simulation. In the first few picoseconds of our\nsimulation, trapped charges start disrupting the crystal structure, leading to\na close-range interaction between oxygen or water molecules and the\ncompositional ions of MAPbI3. We found that there are different degradation\npathways depending on both the polarity of the trapped charge and the kind of\ngas molecule. Especially, the deprotonation of organic cations was\ntheoretically predicted for the first time in the presence of trapped anionic\ncharges and water molecules. We confirmed that a more structurally stable,\nmulti-component perovskite material(MA0.6FA0.4PbI2.9Br0.1) exhibited a much\nlonger lifespan than MAPbI3 under light irradiation even in 100% oxygen\nambience.\n", "  To understand the expansion dynamics of the universe from galaxy cluster\nscales, using the angular diameter distance (ADD) data from two different\ngalaxy cluster surveys, we constrain four cosmological models to explore the\nunderlying value of $H_0$ and employ the model-independent Gaussian Processes\nto investigate the evolution of the equation of state of dark energy. The ADD\ndata in the X-ray bands consists of two samples covering the redshift ranges\n[0.023, 0.784] and [0.14, 0.89], respectively. We find that: (i) For these two\nsamples, the obtained values of $H_0$ are more consistent with the recent local\nobservation by Riess et al. than the global measurement by the Plank\nCollaboration, and the $\\Lambda$CDM model is still preferred utilizing the\ninformation criterions; (ii) For the first sample, there is no evidence of\ndynamical dark energy (DDE) at the $2\\sigma$ confidence level (CL); (iii) For\nthe second one, the reconstructed equation of state of dark energy exhibits a\nphantom-crossing behavior in the relatively low redshift range over the\n$2\\sigma$ CL, which gives a hint that the late-time universe may be actually\ndominated by the DDE from galaxy cluster scales; (iv) By adding a combination\nof Type Ia Supernovae, cosmic chronometers and Planck-2015 shift parameter and\nHII galaxy measurements into both ADD samples, the DDE exists evidently over\nthe $2\\sigma$ CL.\n", "  We develop an approach to realize a quantum switch for Rydberg excitation in\natoms with $Y$-typed level configuration. We find that the steady population on\ntwo different Rydberg states can be reversibly exchanged in a controllable way\nby properly tuning the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction. Moreover, our numerical\nsimulations verify that the switching scheme is robust against spontaneous\ndecay, environmental disturbance, as well as the duration of operation on the\ninteraction, and also a high switching efficiency is quite attainable, which\nmakes it have potential applications in quantum information processing and\nother Rydberg-based quantum technologies.\n", "  To reconcile the current tensions between high and low redshift observations,\nwe perform the first constraints on the Finslerian cosmological models\nincluding the effective dark matter and dark energy components. We find that\nall the four Finslerian models could alleviate effectively the Hubble constant\n($H_0$) tension and the amplitude of the root-mean-square density fluctuations\n($\\sigma_8$) tension between the Planck measurements and the local Universe\nobservations at the 68$\\%$ confidence level. The addition of a massless sterile\nneutrino and a varying total mass of active neutrinos to the base Finslerian\ntwo-parameter model, respectively, reduces the $H_0$ tension from $3.4\\sigma$\nto $1.9\\sigma$ and alleviates the $\\sigma_8$ tension better than the other\nthree Finslerian models. Computing the Bayesian evidence, with respect to\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, our analysis shows a weak preference for the base\nFinslerian model and moderate preferences for its three one-parameter\nextensions. Based on the model-independent Gaussian Processes, we propose a new\nlinear relation which can describe the current redshift space distortions data\nvery well. Using the most stringent constraints we can provide, we have also\nobtained the limits of typical model parameters for three one-parameter\nextensional models.\n", "  Stacking atomic monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMDs) has emerged as an effective way to engineer their properties. In\nprinciple, the staggered band alignment of TMD heterostructures should result\nin the formation of inter-layer excitons with long lifetimes and robust valley\npolarization. However, these features have been observed simultaneously only in\nMoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures. Here we report on the observation of long\nlived inter-layer exciton emission in a MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$/MoS$_2$ trilayer van\nder Waals heterostructure. The inter-layer nature of the observed transition is\nconfirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy, as well as by analyzing the\ntemporal, excitation power and temperature dependence of the inter-layer\nemission peak. The observed complex photoluminescence dynamics suggests the\npresence of quasi-degenerate momentum-direct and momentum-indirect bandgaps. We\nshow that circularly polarized optical pumping results in long lived valley\npolarization of inter-layer exciton. Intriguingly, the inter-layer exciton\nphotoluminescence has helicity opposite to the excitation. Our results show\nthat through a careful choice of the TMDs forming the van der Waals\nheterostructure it is possible to control the circular polarization of the\ninter-layer exciton emission.\n", "  We present a technique to fabricate ultrathin (down to 20 nm) uniform\nelectron transparent windows at dedicated locations in a SiN membrane for in\nsitu transmission electron microscopy experiments. An electron-beam (e-beam)\nresist is spray-coated on the backside of the membrane in a KOH- etched cavity\nin silicon which is patterned using through-membrane electron-beam lithography.\nThis is a controlled way to make transparent windows in membranes, whilst the\ntopside of the membrane remains undamaged and retains its flatness. Our\napproach was optimized for MEMS-based heating chips but can be applied to any\nchip design. We show two different applications of this technique for (1)\nfabrication of a nanogap electrode by means of electromigration in thin\nfree-standing metal films and (2) making low-noise graphene nanopore devices.\n", "  In this paper we show how a deep-submicron FPGA can be modified to operate at\nextremely low temperatures through modifications in the supporting hardware and\nin the firmware programming it. Though FPGAs are not designed to operate at a\nfew Kelvin, it is possible to do so on virtue of the extremely high doping\nlevels found in deep-submicron CMOS technology nodes. First, any PCB component,\nthat does not conform with this requirement, is removed. Both the majority of\ndecoupling capacitor types and voltage regulators are not well behaved at\ncryogenic temperatures, asking for an ad-hoc solution to stabilize the FPGA\nsupply voltage, especially for sensitive applications. Therefore, we have\ndesigned a firmware that enforces a constant power consumption, so as to\nstabilize the supply voltage in the interior of the FPGA chip. The FPGA is\npowered with a supply at several meters distance, causing significant IR drop\nand thus fluctuations on the local supply voltage. To achieve the\nstabilization, the variation in digital logic speed, which directly corresponds\nto changes in supply voltage, is constantly measured and corrected for through\na tunable oscillator farm, implemented on the FPGA. The method is versatile and\nrobust, enabling seamless porting to other FPGA families and configurations.\n", "  We present high-spatial-resolution ($\\sim 0.12''$ or $\\approx 800 \\, {\\rm\npc}$ at $z = 4.5$) ALMA $870\\,\\mu$m dust continuum observations of a sample of\n44 ultrared dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected from the H-ATLAS and\nHerMES far-infrared surveys because of their red colors from 250 to 500 $\\mu$m:\n$S_{500} / S_{250} > 1.5$ and $S_{500} / S_{350} > 1.0$. With photometric\nredshifts in the range $z \\sim 4$-6, our sample includes the most luminous\nstarbursting systems in the early Universe known so far, with total obscured\nstar-formation rates (SFRs) of up to $\\sim 4,500 \\, M_\\odot \\, {\\rm yr}^{-1}$,\nas well as a population of lensed, less intrinsically luminous sources. The\nlower limit on the number of ultrared DSFGs at 870 $\\mu$m (with flux densities\nmeasured from the ALMA maps and thus not affected by source confusion) derived\nin this work is in reasonable agreement with models of galaxy evolution,\nwhereas there have been reports of conflicts at 500 $\\mu$m (where flux\ndensities are derived from SPIRE). Ultrared DSFGs have a variety of\nmorphologies (from relatively extended disks with smooth radial profiles, to\ncompact sources, both isolated and interacting) and an average size,\n$\\theta_{\\rm FWHM}$, of $1.46 \\pm 0.41\\, {\\rm kpc}$, considerably smaller than\nthe values reported in previous work for less-luminous DSFGs at lower\nredshifts. The size and the estimated gas-depletion times of our sources are\ncompatible with their being the progenitors of the most massive, compact,\nred-and-dead galaxies at $z \\sim 2$-3, and ultimately of local ultra-massive\nelliptical galaxies or massive galaxy clusters. We are witnessing the birth of\nthe high-mass tail of the red sequence of galaxies.\n", "  We consider the free Klein-Gordon equation with periodic damping. We show on\nthis simple model that if the usual geometric condition holds then the decay of\nthe energy is uniform with respect to the oscillations of the damping, and in\nparticular the size of the derivatives do not play any role. We also show that\nwithout geometric condition the polynomial decay of the energy is even slightly\nbetter for a highly oscillating damping. To prove these estimates we provide a\nparameter dependent version of well known results of semigroup theory.\n", "  Along with crossed electric and magnetic fields in a Hall thruster, a radial\ncomponent of electric field is generated that takes ions toward the walls,\nwhich causes sputtering and produces dust contamination in the thruster plasma.\nConsidering negatively charged dust particles in the Hall thruster, we approach\nanalytically the resistive instability by taking into account the oscillations\nof dust particles, ions and electrons along with finite temperatures of ions\nand electrons. In typical Hall thruster regimes, the resistive instability\ngrowth rate increases with higher collision rates in the plasma, stronger\nmagnetic field but it decreases with higher mass of the dust and higher\ntemperature of the ions and electrons. In comparison with dust-free models, the\npresence of dust results into a drop of the resistive instability growth rate\nby three orders of magnitude, but the growth rate increases slowly for dust\ndensities within the typical range.\n", "  The development of functional composite nanomaterials based on graphene and\nmetal nanoparticles (NPs) is currently the subject of intense research\ninterest. In this study we report the preparation of novel type of graphene/Sn\nand graphene/SnOx (1 < x < 2) hybrid nanostructures and their investigation by\nscanning probe methods. First, we prepare Sn NPs by evaporating 7 - 8 nm tin on\nhighly oriented pyrolytic graphite substrates. Graphene/Sn nanostructures are\nobtained by transferring graphene on top of the tin NPs immediately after\nevaporation. We show by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy\n(STS) that tin NPs reduce significantly the environmental p-type doping of\ngraphene. Furthermore, we demonstrate by low-temperature STM and STS\nmeasurements that superconductivity is induced in graphene, either directly\nsupported by Sn NPs or suspended between them. Additionally, we prepare SnOx\nNPs by annealing the evaporated tin at 500 ${^o}$C. STS measurements performed\non hybrid graphene/SnOx nanostructures reveal the electronic band gap of SnOx\nNPs. The results can open new avenues for the fabrication of novel hybrid\nsuperconducting nanomaterials with designed structures and morphologies.\n", "  In designing and optimizing new-generation nanomaterials and related quantum\ndevices, dissipation versus decoherence phenomena are often accounted for via\nlocal scattering models, such as relaxation-time and Boltzmann-like schemes.\nHere we show that the use of such local scattering approaches within the\nWigner-function formalism may lead to unphysical results, namely anomalous\nsuppression of intersubband relaxation, incorrect thermalization dynamics, and\nviolation of probability-density positivity. Furthermore, we propose a\nquantum-mechanical generalization of relaxation-time and Boltzmann-like models,\nresulting in nonlocal scattering superoperators that enable one to overcome\nsuch limitations.\n", "  Gamma-sky.net is a novel interactive website designed for exploring the\ngamma-ray sky. The Map View portion of the site is powered by the Aladin Lite\nsky atlas, providing a scalable survey image tesselated onto a\nthree-dimensional sphere. The map allows for interactive pan and zoom\nnavigation as well as search queries by sky position or object name. The\ndefault image overlay shows the gamma-ray sky observed by the Fermi-LAT\ngamma-ray space telescope. Other survey images (e.g. Planck microwave images in\nlow/high frequency bands, ROSAT X-ray image) are available for comparison with\nthe gamma-ray data. Sources from major gamma-ray source catalogs of interest\n(Fermi-LAT 2FHL, 3FGL and a TeV source catalog) are overlaid over the sky map\nas markers. Clicking on a given source shows basic information in a popup, and\ndetailed pages for every source are available via the Catalog View component of\nthe website, including information such as source classification, spectrum and\nlight-curve plots, and literature references.\n  We intend for gamma-sky.net to be applicable for both professional\nastronomers as well as the general public. The website started in early June\n2016 and is being developed as an open-source, open data project on GitHub\n(https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-sky). We plan to extend it to display more\ngamma-ray and multi-wavelength data. Feedback and contributions are very\nwelcome!\n", "  Within this work a passive and wireless magnetic sensor, to monitor linear\ndisplacements is proposed. We exploit recent advances in 3D printing and\nfabricate a polymer bonded magnet with a spatially linear magnetic field\ncomponent corresponding to the length of the magnet. Regulating the magnetic\ncompound fraction during printing allows specific shaping of the magnetic field\ndistribution. A giant magnetoresistance magnetic field sensor is combined with\na radio-frequency identification tag in order to passively monitor the exerted\nmagnetic field of the printed magnet. Due to the tailored magnetic field, a\ndisplacement of the magnet with respect to the sensor can be detected within\nthe sub-mm regime. The sensor design provides good flexibility by controlling\nthe 3D printing process according to application needs. Absolute displacement\ndetection using low cost components and providing passive operation, long term\nstability and longevity renders the proposed sensor system ideal for structural\nhealth monitoring applications.\n", "  Graphene and related two-dimensional materials are promising candidates for\natomically thin, flexible, and transparent optoelectronics. In particular, the\nstrong light-matter interaction in graphene has allowed for the development of\nstate-of-the-art photodetectors, optical modulators, and plasmonic devices. In\naddition, electrically biased graphene on SiO2 substrates can be used as a\nlow-efficiency emitter in the mid-infrared range. However, emission in the\nvisible range has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of bright\nvisible-light emission from electrically biased suspended graphenes. In these\ndevices, heat transport is greatly minimised; thus hot electrons (~ 2800 K)\nbecome spatially localised at the centre of graphene layer, resulting in a\n1000-fold enhancement in the thermal radiation efficiency. Moreover, strong\noptical interference between the suspended graphene and substrate can be\nutilized to tune the emission spectrum. We also demonstrate the scalability of\nthis technique by realizing arrays of chemical-vapour-deposited graphene bright\nvisible-light emitters. These results pave the way towards the realisation of\ncommercially viable large-scale, atomically-thin, flexible and transparent\nlight emitters and displays with low-operation voltage, and graphene-based,\non-chip ultrafast optical communications.\n", "  Hydrodynamic interactions (HIs), namely solvent mediated long-range\ninteractions between dispersed particles, play a crucial role in the assembly\nand dynamics of many active systems, from swimming bacteria to swarms of\npropelling microrobots. Here we experimentally demonstrate the emergence of\nlong-living hydrodynamic bound states between model micro-swimmers at low\nReynolds number. A rotating magnetic field forces colloidal hematite\nmicroparticles to translate at a constant and frequency-tunable speed close to\na bounding plane in a viscous fluid. At high driving frequency, HIs dominate\nover magnetic dipolar ones, and close propelling particles couple into bound\nstates by adjusting their translational speed in order to optimize the\ntransport of the pair. The physical system is described by considering the HIs\nwith the boundary surface and the effect of gravity, providing an excellent\nagreement with the experimental data for all the range of parameters explored.\nMoreover, we show that in dense suspensions, these bound states can be extended\nto onedimensional arrays of particles assembled by the sole HIs. Our results\nmanifest the importance of the boundary surface in the interaction and dynamics\nof confined propelling microswimmers.\n", "  The asteroid belt contains less than a thousandth of Earth's mass and is\nradially segregated, with S-types dominating the inner belt and C-types the\nouter belt. It is generally assumed that the belt formed with far more mass and\nwas later strongly depleted. Here we show that the present-day asteroid belt is\nconsistent with having formed empty, without any planetesimals between Mars and\nJupiter's present-day orbits. This is consistent with models in which drifting\ndust is concentrated into an isolated annulus of terrestrial planetesimals.\nGravitational scattering during terrestrial planet formation causes radial\nspreading, transporting planetesimals from inside 1-1.5 AU out to the belt.\nSeveral times the total current mass in S-types is implanted, with a preference\nfor the inner main belt. C-types are implanted from the outside, as the giant\nplanets' gas accretion destabilizes nearby planetesimals and injects a fraction\ninto the asteroid belt, preferentially in the outer main belt. These\nimplantation mechanisms are simple byproducts of terrestrial- and giant planet\nformation. The asteroid belt may thus represent a repository for planetary\nleftovers that accreted across the Solar System but not in the belt itself.\n", "  We construct local generalizations of 3-state Potts models with exotic\ncritical points. We analytically show that these are described by non-diagonal\nmodular invariant partition functions of products of $Z_3$ parafermion or\n$u(1)_6$ conformal field theories (CFTs). These correspond either to\nnon-trivial permutation invariants or block diagonal invariants, that one can\nunderstand in terms of anyon condensation. In terms of lattice parafermion\noperators, the constructed models correspond to parafermion chains with\nmany-body terms. Our construction is based on how the partition function of a\nCFT depends on symmetry sectors and boundary conditions. This enables to write\nthe partition function corresponding to one modular invariant as a linear\ncombination of another over different sectors and boundary conditions, which\ntranslates to a general recipe how to write down a microscopic model, tuned to\ncriticality. We show that the scheme can also be extended to construct critical\ngeneralizations of $k$-state Potts models.\n", "  We study the asymptotic behaviour of eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the Witten\nLaplacian on a smooth compact Riemannian manifold without boundary. We show\nthat they converge to the Pollicott-Ruelle spectrum of the corresponding\ngradient flow acting on appropriate anisotropic Sobolev spaces. In particular,\nour results relate the approach of Laudenbach and Harvey--Lawson to Morse\ntheory using currents, which was discussed in previous work of the authors, and\nWitten's point of view based on semiclassical analysis and tunneling. As an\napplication of our methods, we also construct a natural family of quasimodes\nsatisfying the Witten-Helffer-Sj\\\"ostrand tunneling formulas and the Fukaya\nconjecture on Witten deformation of the wedge product.\n", "  Some Quantum Gravity models predict a violation of Lorentz invariance.\nNamely, the velocity of photons in vacuum could depend on their energies. One\npossibility for Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) searches is to look for\nenergy-dependent delays in the arrival time of very high energy (VHE) photons\ncoming from distant sources such as TeV emitting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN),\nmainly blazars. Up to now, observations of flaring AGN have only provided upper\nlimits on LIV energy scale since no significant time-delay was found and\nconfirmed. However, AGN are not perfect sources for such LIV searches because\nintrinsic temporal effects can be produced by emission processes, similarly to\nwhat has been observed with gamma-ray bursts. With the beginning of the\nCherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) operations in the coming decade, significant\nlags should be measured and the question of the origin of these lags will\narise. In particular, propagation effects (LIV) will have to be disentangled\nfrom source-intrinsic effects. A precise time-dependent modeling of blazar\nflares becomes necessary to understand the different origins of these\ntime-delays. In this contribution we report on time-delay studies for blazars\nin the VHE domain. Using dif- ferent time-dependent emission scenarios of\nblazar flares, we illustrate their resulting intrinsic spectral lags and\nprovide tools for further analyses of the fine temporal and spectral behavior\nof such astrophysical sources. Tightly constraining intrinsic effects should\nthen allow to better high- light any extrinsic contribution due to LIV.\nConversely, any significant detection of a time-delay should provide new\nconstraints on emission scenarios.\n", "  In this paper, we prove that there are no solutions for the curvature\nequation \\[ \\Delta u+e^{u}=8\\pi n\\delta_{0}\\text{ on }E_{\\tau}, \\quad\nn\\in\\mathbb{N}, \\] where $E_{\\tau}$ is a flat rectangular torus and\n$\\delta_{0}$ is the Dirac measure at the lattice points. This confirms a\nconjecture in \\cite{CLW2} and also improves a result of Eremenko and Gabrielov\n\\cite{EG}. The nonexistence is a delicate problem because the equation always\nhas solutions if $8\\pi n$ in the RHS is replaced by $2\\pi \\rho$ with\n$0<\\rho\\notin 4\\mathbb{N}$. Geometrically, our result implies that a\nrectangular torus $E_{\\tau}$ admits a metric with curvature $+1$ acquiring a\nconic singularity at the lattice points with angle $2\\pi\\alpha$ if and only if\n$\\alpha$ is not an odd integer.\n  Unexpectedly, our proof of the nonexistence result is to apply the spectral\ntheory of finite-gap potential, or equivalently the algebro-geometric solutions\nof stationary KdV hierarchy equations. Indeed, our proof can also yield a sharp\nnonexistence result for the curvature equation with singular sources at three\nhalf periods and the lattice points.\n", "  This paper describes an analysis performed at 250 GeV centre of mass energy\nfor the reaction e+e- -> bbbar with the International Linear Collider, ILC,\nassuming an integrated luminosity of 500 fb-1. This measurement requires\ndetermining the b quark charge, which can be optimally performed using the\nprecise micro-vertex detector of the detector ILD and the charged kaon\nidentification provided by the dE/dx information of its TPC. Given that the\nforward backward asymmetry is maximal for e-L (Left-handed electron\npolarisation), it has been necessary to develop a new method to correct for\nunavoidable angular migration due to b charge mis-measurements. This correction\nis based on the reconstructed events themselves without introducing external\ncorrections which would induce large uncertainties. With polarized beams, one\ncan separate the Z and photon vector and axial couplings to b quarks. The\nprecision reached is at the few per mill level, and should allow to\nconfirm/discard the deviation observed at LEP1 on the ZbRbR coupling. Model\nindependent upper bounds on the tensor couplings, F2V and F2A, are derived\nusing the shape of the angular distribution.\n", "  In this study, we assess the influence of solvation on the accuracy and\nreliability of nuclear shielding calculations for amino acids in comparison to\nexperimental data. We focus particularly on the performance of solvation\nmethods for different protonation states, as biological molecules occur almost\nexclusively in aqueous solution and are subject to protonation with pH. We\nidentify significant shortcomings of current implicit solvent models and\npresent a hybrid solvation approach that improves agreement with experimental\ndata by taking into account the presence of direct interactions between amino\nacid protonation state and water molecules.\n", "  Quantum coherence, the physical property underlying fundamental phenomena\nsuch as multi-particle interference and entanglement, has emerged as a valuable\nresource upon which exotic modern technologies are founded. In general, the\nmost prominent adversary of quantum coherence is noise arising from the\ninteraction of the associated dynamical system with its environment. Under\ncertain conditions, however, the existence of noise may drive quantum and\nclassical systems to endure intriguing nontrivial effects. Along these lines,\nhere we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that when two\nindistinguishable particles co-propagate through quantum networks affected by\nnoise, the system always evolves into a steady state in which coherences\nbetween certain separable states perpetually prevail. Furthermore, we show that\nthe same steady state with surviving quantum coherences is reached\nirrespectively of the configuration in which the particles are prepared.\n", "  The solution of Dirac's equation for the hydrogen atom according to\nrelativistic wave mechanics yields for each state a vectorial amplitude\nfunction with four components, two large and two small. Each such component has\nits characteristic surface of constant amplitude, of which we plot several\nexamples. For each state of the hydrogen atom there is both a density of\nelectronic charge surrounding the atomic nucleus and an electronic current\ncirculating about the polar axis; the latter generates a magnetic dipolar\nmoment that agrees precisely with experiment.\n", "  We perform Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations of the behaviour of a film of\ninsulating material containing a distribution of magnetic nanoparticles. We\nassume that these particles only interact through dipolar forces and we find\nthat their behaviour at low T shows characteristics of a spin-glass with a\nfreezing T_f at which the linear susceptibility and the specific heat show a\nmaximum. We obtain the spin glass order parameter as a function of temperature\nand we also calculate the time auto-correlation of the spin at the center of\nthe system. We find that these results are consistent with the temperature\ndependence of the variance and the mean of the local field at the central spin.\n", "  The 21cm neutral hydrogen line is likely to be a key probe for studying the\nepoch of reionization and comic dawn in the forthcoming decades. This prospect\nstimulates the development of the theoretical basis for simulating the power\nspectrum of this line. Because of the beam size of the upcoming radio\ntelescopes at high redshifts, most of the theoretical models are focused on the\ninhomogeneities on scales above few comoving megaparsecs. Therefore, smaller\nscales are often neglected and modeled with approximated sub-grid models. In\nthis study we explore whether the perturbations on small scales ($\\lesssim\n1h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$) can affect the 21cm signal on larger scales. Two distinct\nmechanism are discussed. First, we show that during the cosmic dawn small scale\nperturbations regulate the formation time of the first Lyman-alpha Emitters\n(LAE), and consequently the coupling timing of spin and kinetic temperatures.\nDue to the low number density of LAE, the inhomogeneity of coupling includes\nthe shot noise and manifests itself in the observed 21cm power spectrum. Second\nmechanism works during the reionization when the ionized bubbles actively grow\nand overlap. Small scales perturbations affect the galactic properties and\nmerger histories, and consequently the number of ionizing photons produced by\neach galaxy. The ionizing photons bring the perturbations from the galactic\nscales to the scales of ionizing fronts, affecting the 21cm power spectrum. We\nconclude that these two effects introduce stochasticity in the potentially\nobserved 21cm power spectrum and, moreover, might give another perspective into\nthe physics of the first galaxies.\n", "  Let $f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n!}q^{n(n-1)/2}x^n$ ($0<q<1$) be the\ndeformed exponential function. It is known that the zeros of $f(x)$ are real\nand form a negative decreasing sequence $(x_k)$ ($k\\ge 1$). We investigate the\ncomplete asymptotic expansion for $x_{k}$ and prove that for any $n\\ge1$, as\n$k\\to \\infty$, \\begin{align*}\nx_k=-kq^{1-k}\\Big(1+\\sum_{i=1}^{n}C_i(q)k^{-1-i}+o(k^{-1-n})\\Big), \\end{align*}\nwhere $C_i(q)$ are some $q$ series which can be determined recursively. We show\nthat each $C_{i}(q)\\in \\mathbb{Q}[A_0,A_1,A_2]$, where\n$A_{i}=\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}m^i\\sigma(m)q^m$ and $\\sigma(m)$ denotes the sum of\npositive divisors of $m$. When writing $C_{i}$ as a polynomial in $A_0, A_1$\nand $A_2$, we find explicit formulas for the coefficients of the linear terms\nby using Bernoulli numbers. Moreover, we also prove that $C_{i}(q)\\in\n\\mathbb{Q}[E_2,E_4,E_6]$, where $E_2$, $E_4$ and $E_6$ are the classical\nEisenstein series of weight 2, 4 and 6, respectively.\n", "  We propose a data-driven filtered reduced order model (DDF-ROM) framework for\nthe numerical simulation of fluid flows. The novel DDF-ROM framework consists\nof two steps: (i) In the first step, we use explicit ROM spatial filtering of\nthe nonlinear PDE to construct a filtered ROM. This filtered ROM is\nlow-dimensional, but is not closed (because of the nonlinearity in the given\nPDE). (ii) In the second step, we use data-driven modeling to close the\nfiltered ROM, i.e., to model the interaction between the resolved and\nunresolved modes. To this end, we use a quadratic ansatz to model this\ninteraction and close the filtered ROM. To find the new coefficients in the\nclosed filtered ROM, we solve an optimization problem that minimizes the\ndifference between the full order model data and our ansatz. We emphasize that\nthe new DDF-ROM is built on general ideas of spatial filtering and optimization\nand is independent of (restrictive) phenomenological arguments.\n  We investigate the DDF-ROM in the numerical simulation of a 2D channel flow\npast a circular cylinder at Reynolds number $Re=100$. The DDF-ROM is\nsignificantly more accurate than the standard projection ROM. Furthermore, the\ncomputational costs of the DDF-ROM and the standard projection ROM are similar,\nboth costs being orders of magnitude lower than the computational cost of the\nfull order model. We also compare the new DDF-ROM with modern ROM closure\nmodels in the numerical simulation of the 1D Burgers equation. The DDF-ROM is\nmore accurate and significantly more efficient than these ROM closure models.\n", "  The study of quarkonia in heavy-ion collisions has been the subject of\nintense experimental and theoretical effort, ever since their production was\npredicted to be sensitive to the formation of a deconfined state of\nstrongly-interacting matter, known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). In p-Pb\ncollisions, Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects, such as nuclear shadowing or\npartonic energy loss, are expected to influence quarkonium production. The\nstudy of such system is therefore crucial to shed light on the mechanisms\ntaking place at the initial-state of quarkonium production, and to disentangle\nthe cold and hot nuclear effects envisioned in Pb-Pb collisions. The ALICE\nexperiment at the LHC, is capable of reconstructing J/$\\psi$, $\\psi$(2S) and\n$\\Upsilon$ states at forward rapidity through their $\\mu^{\\rm{+}}\\mu^{\\rm{-}}$\ndecay channel, as well as J/$\\psi$ at central rapidity through their\n$e^{\\rm{+}}e^{\\rm{-}}$ decay channel, down to zero transverse momentum. A\nreview of the main ALICE findings from the measurements of the inclusive\nquarkonium yields in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV,\ncollected during the LHC Run I period, as well as more recent results from\nJ/$\\psi$ measurements in p-Pb at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 8.16 TeV, from LHC Run\nII period, will be presented in this paper.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to perform stability analysis of anisotropic\ndissipative cylindrical collapsing model in $f(R,T,R_{\\mu\\nu} T^{\\mu\\nu})$\ngravity. In this context, the modified version of hydrodynamical equation is\nexplored by means of dynamical equations and radial perturbation scheme. We\nexamined the role of adiabatic index, dissipation as well as the particular\ncosmological model on the onset of dynamical instability of the evolving\ncylindrical system that was initially in hydrostatic equilibrium with Newtonian\nand post Newtonian approximations. It is pointed out that extra curvature terms\nof $f(R,T,R_{\\mu\\nu}T^{\\mu\\mu\\nu})$ gravity tends to increase the stability,\nwhile that heat radiations push the system to enter into unstable window.\nFurther, our results reveal the significance of adiabatic index in the\nstability analysis of cylindrical celestial model.\n", "  In [1], the authors have studied stability of certain causal properties of\nspace-times in general relativity. As a continuation of this work, in the\npresent paper, we review and discuss, some more aspects of stability which\noccur in various situations in the dynamics of general relativity. We argue\nthat not only choice of appropriate topology, but also the nature of\nperturbation, like metric, matter or initial data, are key factors in deciding\nwhether a property is stable or not. We also study certain properties of\nspace-times which are generic in an appropriate mathematical sense. In\nparticular we argue that Linearization stability of a space-time is a generic\nproperty.\n", "  Tight-binding Hamiltonian on the prismatic pentagonal lattice is exactly\nsolved to obtain the analytic expressions of dispersion relations and\neigenvectors. This lattice is made of prismatic pentagon which is different\nfrom Cairo pentagon. Six different dispersion relations and total density of\nstates are obtained. Dispersion relations are symmetric about the zero energy\nat a particular point in the parameter space. Although a large gap is found for\nthe Cairo pentagonal lattice, no gap as well as no Dirac cone is found to\nappear in the tight-binding band structure for this prismatic pentagonal\nlattice. Instead, a pair of van Hove singularities has been identified at two\ndifferent energy values in the band structure.\n", "  One of simplest examples of navigation found in nature is run-and-tumble\nchemotaxis. Tumbles reorient cells randomly, and cells can drift toward\nattractants or away from repellents by biasing the frequency of these events.\nThe post-tumble swimming directions are typically correlated with those prior,\nas measured by the variance of the reorientation angle distribution. This\nvariance can range from large, in the case of bacteria, to so small that tumble\nevents are imperceptible, as observed in choanoflagellates. This raises the\nquestion of optimality: why is such a range of persistence observed in nature?\nHere we study persistent run-and-tumble dynamics, focusing first on the\noptimisation of the linearised chemotactic response within the two-dimensional\nparameter space of tumble frequency and angular persistence. Although an\noptimal persistence does exist for a given tumble frequency, in the full\nparameter space there is a continuum of optimal solutions. Introducing finite\ntumble times that depend on the persistence can change this picture,\nilluminating one possible method for selecting tumble persistence based on\nspecies-specific reorientation dynamics. Moving beyond linear theory we find\nthat optimal chemotactic strengths exist, and that these maximise reaction when\nswimming in a wrong direction, but have little or no reaction when swimming\nwith even the slightest projection along the chemoattractant gradient.\n", "  A review of the searches for the SM Higgs boson produced in association with\na pair of top quarks, ${t\\bar{t}H}$, using up to 13.3 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC\nis presented. Searches in the diphoton, multilepton and $b\\bar{b}$ decay\nchannels are summarised. The combination of these searches yields a measured\n(expected) significance for the observation of the ${t\\bar{t}H}$ production\nprocess of $2.8 \\sigma$ ($1.8 \\sigma$).\n", "  Applications that require substantial computational resources today cannot\navoid the use of heavily parallel machines. Embracing the opportunities of\nparallel computing and especially the possibilities provided by a new\ngeneration of massively parallel accelerator devices such as GPUs, Intel's Xeon\nPhi or even FPGAs enables applications and studies that are inaccessible to\nserial programs. Here we outline the opportunities and challenges of massively\nparallel computing for Monte Carlo simulations in statistical physics, with a\nfocus on the simulation of systems exhibiting phase transitions and critical\nphenomena. This covers a range of canonical ensemble Markov chain techniques as\nwell as generalized ensembles such as multicanonical simulations and population\nannealing. While the examples discussed are for simulations of spin systems,\nmany of the methods are more general and moderate modifications allow them to\nbe applied to other lattice and off-lattice problems including polymers and\nparticle systems. We discuss important algorithmic requirements for such highly\nparallel simulations, such as the challenges of random-number generation for\nsuch cases, and outline a number of general design principles for parallel\nMonte Carlo codes to perform well.\n", "  Geometric continuum models for fluid lipid membranes are considered using\nclassical field theory, within a covariant variational approach. The approach\nis cast as a higher-derivative Lagrangian formulation of continuum classical\nfield theory, and it can be seen as a covariant version of the field\ntheoretical variational approach that uses the height representation. This\nnovel Lagrangian formulation is presented first for a generic reparametrization\ninvariant geometric model, deriving its equilibrium condition equation, or\nshape equation, and its linear and angular stress tensors, using the classical\nCanham-Helfrich elastic bending energy for illustration. The robustness of the\nformulation is established by extending it to the presence of external forces,\nand to the case of heterogenous lipid membranes, breaking reparametrization\ninvariance. In addition, a useful and compact general expression for the second\nvariation of the free energy is obtained within the Lagrangian formulation, as\na first step towards the study of the stability of membrane configurations. The\nsimple structure of the expressions derived for the basic entities that appear\nin the mechanics of a lipid membrane is a direct consequence of the well\nestablished power of a Lagrangian variational approach. The paper is\nself-contained, and it is meant to provide, besides a new framework, also a\nconvenient introduction to the mechanics of lipid membranes.\n", "  In this chapter we analyze the multiple ionization by impact of |Z|=1\nprojectiles: electrons, positrons, protons and antiprotons. Differences and\nsimilarities among the cross sections by these four projectiles allows us to\nhave an insight on the physics involved. Mass and charge effects, energy\nthresholds, and relative importance of collisional and post-collisional\nprocesses are discussed. For this purpose, we performed a detailed\ntheoretical-experimental comparison for single up to quintuple ionization of\nNe, Ar, Kr and Xe by particles and antiparticles. We include an extensive\ncompilation of the available data for the sixteen collisional systems, and the\ntheoretical cross sections by means of the continuum distorted wave eikonal\ninitial state approximation. We underline here that post-collisional ionization\nis decisive to describe multiple ionization by light projectiles, covering\nalmost the whole energy range, from threshold to high energies. The\nnormalization of positron and antiproton measurements to electron impact ones,\nthe lack of data in certain cases, and the future prospects are presented and\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present two NLO exclusive impact factors computed in the QCD shock wave\napproach. These are the very first steps towards precision studies of a wide\nrange of high energy exclusive processes with saturation effects in $ep$, $eA$,\n$pp$ and $pA$ collisions.\n", "  We present Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) version of Fortran 90 programs for\nsolving the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation for a Bose-Einstein condensate in\none, two, and three spatial dimensions, optimized for use with GNU and Intel\ncompilers. We use the split-step Crank-Nicolson algorithm for imaginary- and\nreal-time propagation, which enables efficient calculation of stationary and\nnon-stationary solutions, respectively. The present OpenMP programs are\ndesigned for computers with multi-core processors and optimized for compiling\nwith both commercially-licensed Intel Fortran and popular free open-source GNU\nFortran compiler. The programs are easy to use and are elaborated with helpful\ncomments for the users. All input parameters are listed at the beginning of\neach program. Different output files provide physical quantities such as\nenergy, chemical potential, root-mean-square sizes, densities, etc. We also\npresent speedup test results for new versions of the programs.\n", "  The exciting field of stretchable electronics (SE) promises numerous novel\napplications, particularly in-body and medical diagnostics devices. However,\nfuture advanced SE miniature devices will require high-density, extremely\nstretchable interconnects with micron-scale footprints, which calls for proven\nstandardized (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-type) process\nrecipes using bulk integrated circuit (IC) microfabrication tools and\nfine-pitch photolithography patterning. Here, we address this combined\nchallenge of microfabrication with extreme stretchability for high-density SE\ndevices by introducing CMOS-enabled, free-standing, miniaturized interconnect\nstructures that fully exploit their 3D kinematic freedom through an interplay\nof buckling, torsion, and bending to maximize stretchability. Integration with\nstandard CMOS-type batch processing is assured by utilizing the Flex-to-Rigid\n(F2R) post-processing technology to make the back-end-of-line interconnect\nstructures free-standing, thus enabling the routine microfabrication of\nhighly-stretchable interconnects. The performance and reproducibility of these\nfree-standing structures is promising: an elastic stretch beyond 2000% and\nultimate (plastic) stretch beyond 3000%, with <0.3% resistance change, and >10\nmillion cycles at 1000% stretch with <1% resistance change. This generic\ntechnology provides a new route to exciting highly-stretchable miniature\ndevices.\n", "  Exchange hole is the principle constituent in density functional theory,\nwhich can be used to accurately design exchange energy functional and range\nseparated hybrid functionals coupled with some appropriate correlation.\nRecently, density matrix expansion (DME) based semi-local exchange hole\nproposed by Tao-Mo gained attention due to its fulfillment of some exact\nconstraints. We propose a new long-range corrected (LC) scheme that combines\nmeta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) exchange functionals\ndesigned from DME exchange hole coupled with the ab-initio Hartree-Fock (HF)\nexchange integral by separating the Coulomb interaction operator using standard\nerror function. Associate with Lee-Yang-Parr (LYP) correlation functional,\nassessment and benchmarking of our functional using well-known test set shows\nthat it performs remarkably well for a broad range of molecular properties,\nsuch as thermochemistry, noncovalent interaction and barrier height of chemical\nreactions.\n", "  Cross-correlating the lensing signals of galaxies and comic microwave\nbackground (CMB) fluctuations is expected to provide valuable cosmological\ninformation. In particular it may help tighten constraints on parameters\ndescribing the properties of intrinsically aligned galaxies at high redshift.\nTo access the information conveyed by the cross-correlation signal its accurate\ntheoretical description is required. We compute the bias to CMB lensing-galaxy\nshape cross-correlation measurements induced by nonlinear structure growth.\nUsing tree-level perturbation theory for the large-scale structure bispectrum\nwe find that the bias is negative on most angular scales, therefore mimicking\nthe signal of intrinsic alignments. Combining Euclid-like galaxy lensing data\nwith a CMB experiment comparable to the Planck satellite mission the bias\nbecomes significant only on smallest scales ($\\ell\\gtrsim 2500$). For improved\nCMB observations, however, the corrections amount to 10-15 per cent of the CMB\nlensing-intrinsic alignment signal over a wide multipole range ($10 \\lesssim\n\\ell \\lesssim 2000$). Accordingly the power spectrum bias, if uncorrected,\ntranslates into $2\\sigma$ and $3\\sigma$ errors in the determination of the\nintrinsic alignment amplitude in case of CMB stage III and stage IV\nexperiments, respectively.\n", "  Achieving macroscopic directed migration of microscale swimmers in a fluid is\nan important step towards utilizing their autonomous motion. It has been\nexperimentally shown that directed motion can be induced, without any external\nfields, by certain geometrically asymmetric obstacles due to interaction\nbetween their boundaries and the swimmers. In this paper, we propose a\nkinetic-type model to study swimming and directional migration of microscale\nbimetallic rods in a periodic array of posts with non-circular cross-sections.\nBoth rod position and orientation are taken into account; rod trapping and\nrelease on the post boundaries are modeled by empirically characterizing\ncurvature and orientational dependence of the boundary absorption and\ndesorption. Intensity of the directed rod migration, which we call the\nnormalized net flux, is then defined and computed given the geometry of the\npost array. We numerically study the effect of post spacings on the flux; we\nalso apply shape optimization to find better post shapes that can induce\nstronger flux. Inspired by preliminary numerical results on two candidate\nposts, we perform an approximate analysis on a simplified model to show the key\ngeometric features a good post should have. Based on that, three new candidate\nshapes are proposed which give rise to large fluxes. This approach provides an\neffective tool and guidance for experimentally designing new devices that\ninduce strong directed migration of microscale swimmers.\n"]}
