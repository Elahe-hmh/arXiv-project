various\nstochastic transport processes carried out by self-driven particles, such as\nmolecular motors or vehicles in road traffic. Often these processes take place\nin one-dimensional systems offering several tracks to the particles, and in\nmany cases the particles are able to change track with a given rate. In this\nwork we consider the case of strong coupling where the hopping rate along the\ntracks and the exchange rates are of the same order, and show how a\nphenomenological approach based on a domain wall theory can describe the\ndynamics of the system. In particular, the domain walls on the different tracks\nform pairs, whose dynamics dominate the behavior of the system.\n", "  We introduce a new rule of motion for a totally asymmetric exclusion process\n(TASEP) representing pedestrian traffic on a lattice. Its characteristic\nfeature is that the positions of the pedestrians, modeled as hard-core\nparticles, are updated in a fixed predefined order, determined by a phase\nattached to each of them. We investigate this model analytically and by Monte\nCarlo simulation on a one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary\nconditions. At a critical value of the particle density a transition occurs\nfrom a phase with `free flow' to one with `jammed flow'. We are able to\nanalytically predict the current-density diagram for the infinite system and to\nfind the scaling function that describes the finite size rounding at the\ntransition point.\n", "  We introduce a new update algorithm for exclusion processes, more suitable\nfor the modeling of pedestrian traffic. Pedestrians are modeled as hard-core\nparticles hopping on a discrete lattice, and are updated in a fixed order,\ndetermined by a phase attached to each pedestrian. While the case of periodic\nboundary conditions was studied in a companion paper, we consider here the case\nof open boundary conditions. The full phase diagram is predicted analytically\nand exhibits a transition between a free flow phase and a jammed phase. The\ndensity profile is predicted in the frame of a domain wall theory, and compared\nto Monte Carlo simulations, in particular in the vicinity of the transition.\n", "  Motivated by interest in pedestrian traffic we study two lanes\n(one-dimensional lattices) of length $L$ that intersect at a single site. Each\nlane is modeled by a TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process). The\nparticles enter and leave lane $\\sigma$ (where $\\sigma=1,2$) with probabilities\n$\\alpha_\\sigma$ and $\\beta_\\sigma$, respectively. We employ the `frozen\nshuffle' update introduced in earlier work [C. Appert-Rolland et al, J. Stat.\nMech. (2011) P07009], in which the particle positions are updated in a fixed\nrandom order. We find analytically that each lane may be in a `free flow' or in\na `jammed' state. Hence the phase diagram in the domain\n$0\\leq\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2\\leq 1$ consists of four regions with boundaries\ndepending on $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$. The regions meet in a single point on the\ndiagonal of the domain. Our analytical predictions for the phase boundaries as\nwell as for the currents and densities in each phase are confirmed by Monte\nCarlo simulations.\n", "  A one-way {\\em street} of width M is modeled as a set of M parallel\none-dimensional TASEPs. The intersection of two perpendicular streets is a\nsquare lattice of size M times M. We consider hard core particles entering each\nstreet with an injection probability \\alpha. On the intersection square the\nhard core exclusion creates a many-body problem of strongly interacting TASEPs\nand we study the collective dynamics that arises. We construct an efficient\nalgorithm that allows for the simulation of streets of infinite length, which\nhave sharply defined critical jamming points. The algorithm employs the `frozen\nshuffle update', in which the randomly arriving particles have fully\ndeterministic bulk dynamics. High precision simulations for street widths up to\nM=24 show that when \\alpha increases, there occur jamming transitions at a\nsequence of M critical values \\alphaM,M < \\alphaM,M-1 < ... < \\alphaM,1. As M\ngrows, the principal transition point \\alphaM,M decreases roughly as \\sim\n1/(log M) in the range of M values studied. We show that a suitable order\nparameter is provided by a reflection coefficient associated with the particle\ncurrent in each TASEP.\n", "  After reviewing the main results obtained within a model for the intersection\nof two perpendicular flows of pedestrians, we present a new finding: the\nchangeover of the jamming transition from continuous to first order when the\nsize of the intersection area increases.\n", "  We derive a hierarchy of kinetic and macroscopic models from a noisy variant\nof the heuristic behavioral Individual-Based Model of Moussaid et al, PNAS\n2011, where the pedestrians are supposed to have constant speeds. This IBM\nsupposes that the pedestrians seek the best compromise between navigation\ntowards their target and collisions avoidance. We first propose a kinetic model\nfor the probability distribution function of the pedestrians. Then, we derive\nfluid models and propose three different closure relations. The first two\nclosures assume that the velocity distribution functions are either a Dirac\ndelta or a von Mises-Fisher distribution respectively. The third closure\nresults from a hydrodynamic limit associated to a Local Thermodynamical\nEquilibrium. We develop an analogy between this equilibrium and Nash equilibia\nin a game theoretic framework. In each case, we discuss the features of the\nmodels and their suitability for practical use.\n", "  We propose a hierarchy of kinetic and macroscopic models for a system\nconsisting of a large number of interacting pedestrians. The basic interaction\nrules are derived from earlier work where the dangerousness level of an\ninteraction with another pedestrian is measured in terms of the derivative of\nthe bearing angle (angle between the walking direction and the line connecting\nthe two subjects) and of the time-to-interaction (time before reaching the\nclosest distance between the two subjects). A mean-field kinetic model is\nderived. Then, three different macroscopic continuum models are proposed. The\nfirst two ones rely on two different closure assumptions of the kinetic model,\nrespectively based on a monokinetic and a von Mises-Fisher distribution. The\nthird one is derived through a hydrodynamic limit. In each case, we discuss the\nrelevance of the model for practical simulations of pedestrian crowds.\n", "  The spontaneous magnetization is proved to vanish continuously at the\ncritical temperature for a class of ferromagnetic Ising spin systems which\nincludes the nearest neighbor ferromagnetic Ising spin model on $\\mathbb Z^d$\nin $d=3$ dimensions. The analysis applies also to higher dimensions, for which\nthe result is already known, and to systems with interactions of power law\ndecay. The proof employs in an essential way an extension of Ising model's\nrandom current representation to the model's infinite volume limit. Using it,\nwe relate the continuity of the magnetization to the vanishing of the free\nboundary condition Gibbs state's Long Range Order parameter. For reflection\npositive models the resulting criterion for continuity may be established\nthrough the infrared bound for all but the borderline case, of the one\ndimensional model with $1/r^2$ interaction, for which the spontaneous\nmagnetization is known to be discontinuous at $T_c$.\n", "  Inside cells, various cargos are transported by teams of molecular motors.\nIntriguingly, the motors involved generally have opposite pulling directions,\nand the resulting cargo dynamics is a biased stochastic motion. It is an open\nquestion how the cell can control this bias. Here we develop a model which\ntakes explicitly into account the elastic coupling of the cargo with each\nmotor. We show that bias can be simply controlled or even reversed in a\ncounterintuitive manner via a change in the external force exerted on the cargo\nor a variation of the ATP binding rate to motors. Furthermore, the\nsuperdiffusive behavior found at short time scales indicates the emergence of\nmotor cooperation induced by cargo-mediated coupling.\n", "  The complex structure and magnetism of Pr$_{2-x}$Bi$_x$Ru$_2$O$_7$ was\ninvestigated by neutron scattering and EXAFS. Pr has an approximate doublet\nground-state and the first excited state is a singlet. This overall crystal\nfield level scheme is similar to metallic Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, which is also\nreported here. While the B-site (Ru) is well ordered throughout, this is not\nthe case for the A-site (Pr/Bi). A distribution of the Pr-O2 bond length\nindicates the Pr environment is not uniform even for $x=0$. The Bi environment\nis highly disordered ostensibly due to the 6s lone pairs on Bi$^{3+}$.\nCorrespondingly we find the non-Kramers doublet ground state degeneracy\notherwise anticipated for Pr in the pyrochlore structure is lifted so as to\nproduce a quadrupolar singlet ground state with a spatially varying energy gap.\nFor $x=0$, below T$_N$, the Ru sublattice orders antiferromagnetically, with\npropagation vector \\textbf{k}= (0,0,0), as for Y$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$. No ordering\nassociated with the Pr sublattice is observed down to 100 mK. The low energy\nmagnetic response of Pr$_{2-x}$Bi$_x$Ru$_2$O$_7$ features a broad spectrum of\nmagnetic excitations associated with inhomogeneous splitting of the Pr\nquasi-doublet ground state. For $x=0$ ($x=0.97$) the spectrum is temperature\ndependent (independent). It appears disorder associated with Bi alloying\nenhances the inhomogeneous Pr crystal field level splitting so that inter-site\ninteractions become irrelevant for $x=0.97$. The structural complexity for the\nA-site may be reflected in the hysteretic uniform magnetization of B-site\nruthenium in the N\\'{e}el phase.\n", "  Different families of models first developed for fluid mechanics have been\nextended to road, pedestrian, or intracellular transport. These models allow to\ndescribe the systems at different scales and to account for different aspects\nof dynamics. In this paper, we focus on pedestrians and illustrate the various\nfamilies of models by giving an example of each type. We discuss the\nspecificities of crowds compared to other transport systems.\n", "  Many different types of cellular cargos are transported bidirectionally along\nmicrotubules by teams of molecular motors. The motion of this cargo-motors\nsystem has been experimentally characterized in vivo as processive with rather\npersistent directionality. Different theoretical approaches have been suggested\nin order to explore the origin of this kind of motion. An effective theoretical\napproach, introduced by M\\\"uller et al., describes the cargo dynamics as a\ntug-of-war between different kinds of motors. An alternative approach has been\nsuggested recently by Kunwar et al., who considered the coupling between motor\nand cargo in more detail. Based on this framework we introduce a model\nconsidering single motor positions which we propagate in continuous time.\nFurthermore, we analyze the possible influence of the discrete time update\nschemes used in previous publications on the system's dynamic.\n", "  We utilized synchrotron-based in-situ diffraction and dominant shear\ndeformation to identify, dissect, and quantify the relevant deformation\nmechanisms in nanocrystalline $\\mathrm{Pd}_{90}\\mathrm{Au}_{10}$ in the\nlimiting case of grain sizes at or below 10 nm. We could identify lattice and\ngrain boundary elasticity, shear shuffling operating in the core region of\ngrain boundaries, stress driven grain boundary migration, and dislocation shear\nalong lattice planes to contribute, however, with significantly different and\nnontrivial stress-dependent shares to overall deformation. Regarding lattice\nelasticity, we find that Hookean linear elasticity prevailed up to the maximal\nstress value of $\\approx$ 1.6 GPa. Shear shuffling that propagates strain\nat/along grain boundaries increases progressively with increasing load to carry\nabout two thirds of the overall strain in the regime of macroplasticity. Stress\ndriven grain boundary migration requires overcoming a threshold stress slightly\nbelow the yield stress of $\\approx$ 1.4 GPa and contributes a share of\n$\\approx$ 10% to overall strain. Appreciable dislocation activity begins at a\nstress value of $\\approx$ 0.9 GPa to then increase and eventually propagate a\nmaximal share of $\\approx$ 15% to overall strain. In the stress regime below\n0.9 GPa, which is characterized by a markedly decreasing tangent modulus, shear\nshuffling and lattice- and grain boundary elasticity operate exclusively. The\nmaterial response in this regime seems indicative of nonlinear viscous behavior\nrather than being correlated with work- or strain hardening as observed in\nconventional fcc metals.\n", "  Whether the glass transition is caused by an underlying singularity or is a\npurely kinetic phenomenon is a significant outstanding question. Studying an\natomistic glass former, we introduce a sampling method to access temperatures\ncorresponding to dynamical regimes usually hard to reach with computer\nsimulation. We find a peak in the specific heat, which we interpret as a drop\nin the density of states. We further present evidence of a liquid-liquid\ntransition to a state rich in locally favoured structures related to a recently\ndiscovered dynamical phase transition.\n", "  We discuss a theoretical model for bidirectional cargo transport in\nbiological cells, which is driven by teams of molecular motors and subject to\nthermal fluctuations. The model describes explicitly the directed motion of the\nmolecular motors on the filament. The motor-cargo coupling is implemented via\nlinear springs. By means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations we show that the\nmodel describes the experimentally observed regimes of anomalous diffusion,\ni.e. subdiffusive behavior at short times followed by superdiffusion at\nintermediate times. The model results indicate that subdiffuse regime is\ninduced by thermal fluctuations while the superdiffusive motion is generated by\ncorrelations of the motors' activity. We also tested the efficiency of\nbidirectional cargo transport in crowded areas by measuring its ability to pass\nbarriers with increased viscosity. Our results show a remarkable gain of\nefficiency for high viscosities.\n", "  Intracellular cargos which are transported by molecular motors move\nstochastically along cytoskeleton filaments. In particular for bidirectionally\ntransported cargos it is an open question whether the characteristics of their\nmotion can result from pure stochastic fluctuations or whether some\ncoordination of the motors is needed. The results of a mean-field model of\ncargo-motors dynamics, which was proposed by M\\\"uller et al.[1] suggest the\nexistence of high motility states which would result from a stochastic\ntug-of-war. Here we analyze a non-mean field extension of their model, that\ntakes explicitly the position of each motor into account. We find that high\nmotility states then disappear. We consider also a mutual motor-motor\nactivation, as an explicit mechanism of motor coordination. We show that the\nresults of the mean-field model are recovered only in case of a strong\nmotor-motor activation in the limit of a high number of motors.\n", "  We present a new theory for modeling forced indentation spectral lineshapes\nof biological particles, which considers non-linear Hertzian deformation due to\nan indenter-particle physical contact and bending deformations of curved beams\nmodeling the particle structure. The bending of beams beyond the critical point\ntriggers the particle dynamic transition to the collapsed state, an extreme\nevent leading to the catastrophic force drop as observed in the force\n(F)-deformation (X) spectra. The theory interprets fine features of the\nspectra: the slope of the FX curves and the position of force-peak signal, in\nterms of mechanical characteristics --- the Young's moduli for Hertzian and\nbending deformations E_H and E_b, and the probability distribution of the\nmaximum strength with the strength of the strongest beam F_b^* and the beams'\nfailure rate m. The theory is applied to successfully characterize the $FX$\ncurves for spherical virus particles --- CCMV, TrV, and AdV.\n", "  We investigate the validity of the equivalence principle near horizons in\nstring theory, analyzing the breakdown of effective field theory caused by\nlongitudinal string spreading effects. An experiment is set up where a detector\nis thrown into a black hole a long time after an early infalling string. Light\ncone gauge calculations, taken at face value, indicate a detectable level of\nroot-mean-square longitudinal spreading of the initial string as measured by\nthe late infaller. This results from the large relative boost between the\nstring and detector in the near horizon region, which develops automatically\ndespite their modest initial energies outside the black hole and the weak\ncurvature in the geometry. We subject this scenario to basic consistency\nchecks, using these to obtain a relatively conservative criterion for its\ndetectability. In a companion paper, we exhibit longitudinal nonlocality in\nwell-defined gauge-invariant S-matrix calculations, obtaining results\nconsistent with the predicted spreading albeit not in a direct analogue of the\nblack hole process. We discuss applications of this effect to the firewall\nparadox, and estimate the time and distance scales it predicts for new physics\nnear black hole and cosmological horizons.\n", "  Particles states transforming in one of the infinite spin representations of\nthe Poincar\\'e group (as classified by E. Wigner) are consistent with\nfundamental physical principles, but local fields generating them from the\nvacuum state cannot exist. While it is known that infinite spin states\nlocalized in a spacelike cone are dense in the one-particle space, we show here\nthat the subspace of states localized in any double cone is trivial. This\nimplies that the free field theory associated with infinite spin has no\nobservables localized in bounded regions. In an interacting theory, if the\nvacuum vector is cyclic for a double cone local algebra, then the theory does\nnot contain infinite spin representations. We also prove that if a\nDoplicher-Haag-Roberts representation (localized in a double cone) of a local\nnet is covariant under a unitary representation of the Poincar\\'e group\ncontaining infinite spin, then it has infinite statistics.\n  These results hold under the natural assumption of the Bisognano-Wichmann\nproperty, and we give a counter-example (with continuous particle degeneracy)\nwithout this property where the conclusions fail. Our results hold true in any\nspacetime dimension s+1 where infinite spin representations exist, namely s >\n1.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the chiral anomaly in a Lorentz-breaking extension\nof QED which, besides the common terms that are present in the Standard Model\nExtension, includes some dimension-five nonminimal couplings. We find, using\nthe Fujikawa formalism, that these nonminimal couplings induce new terms in the\nanomaly which depend on the Lorentz-violating parameters. Perturbative\ncalculations are also carried out in order to investigate whether or not new\nambiguous Carroll-Field-Jackiw terms are induced in the effective action.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a mechanism which induces nontrivial flavor\nstructure from transformations of a noncompact Lie group SL(3,C) in\nnoncommutative geometry. Matrices $L \\in$ SL(3,C) are associated with\naccompanied by the preon fields as $a_{L,R} (x) \\to L_{L,R} a_{L,R} (x)$. In\norder to retain the Hermiticity of the Lagrangian, we assume the same trick\nwhen $\\psi^{\\dagger} \\psi$ is replaced by $\\bar \\psi \\psi$ to construct a\nLorentz invariant Lagrangian. As a result, the Dirac Lagrangian has both of\nflavor-universal gauge interactions and nontrivial Yukawa interactions.\nRemoving the unphysical unitary transformations, Yukawa matrices found to be\n$Y_{ij} = L_{L}^{\\dagger} k L_{R} \\to \\Lambda_{L}^{} U^{\\dagger}_{L} k U_{R}\n\\Lambda_{R}$. Here, $k$ is a coefficient, $U$ is 3 $\\times$ 3 unitary matrix\nand $\\Lambda$ is the eigenvalue matrix $\\Lambda = {\\rm diag}(\\lambda_{1},\n\\lambda_{2}, \\lambda_{3})$ with $\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3} = 1$. If\n$L_{L,R}$ are originated from a broken symmetry, the hierarchy and mixing of\nflavor can be interpreted as the \"Lorentz boost\" and the \"rotation\" in this\nspace respectively.\n", "  A common method of adjusting the metal-insulator transition temperature of\nM$_{1}$ VO$_{2}$ is via disruption of the Peierls pairing by doping, or\ninputting stress or strain. However, since adding even small amounts of dopants\nwill change the band structure, it is unclear how doped VO$_{2}$ retains its\ninsulating character observed in experiments. While strong correlations may be\nresponsible for maintaining a gap, theoretical evidence for this has been very\ndifficult to obtain due to the complexity of the many-body problem involved. In\nthis work we use GW calculations modified to include strong local\n$\\textbf{k}$-space interactions to investigate the changes in band structure\nfrom tungsten doping. We find that the combination of carrier doping and the\nexperimentally observed structural defects introduced by inclusion of tungsten\nare consistent with a change from band-like to Mott-insulating behavior.\n", "  Cells are strongly out-of-equilibrium systems driven by continuous energy\nsupply. They carry out many vital functions requiring active transport of\nvarious ingredients and organelles, some being small, others being large. The\ncytoskeleton, composed of three types of filaments, determines the shape of the\ncell and plays a role in cell motion. It also serves as a road network for the\nso-called cytoskeletal motors. These molecules can attach to a cytoskeletal\nfilament, perform directed motion, possibly carrying along some cargo, and then\ndetach. It is a central issue to understand how intracellular transport driven\nby molecular motors is regulated, in particular because its breakdown is one of\nthe signatures of some neuronal diseases like the Alzheimer.\n  We give a survey of the current knowledge on microtubule based intracellular\ntransport. We first review some biological facts obtained from experiments, and\npresent some modeling attempts based on cellular automata. We start with\nbackground knowledge on the original and variants of the TASEP (Totally\nAsymmetric Simple Exclusion Process), before turning to more application\noriented models. After addressing microtubule based transport in general, with\na focus on in vitro experiments, and on cooperative effects in the\ntransportation of large cargos by multiple motors, we concentrate on axonal\ntransport, because of its relevance for neuronal diseases. It is a challenge to\nunderstand how this transport is organized, given that it takes place in a\nconfined environment and that several types of motors moving in opposite\ndirections are involved. We review several features that could contribute to\nthe efficiency of this transport, including the role of motor-motor\ninteractions and of the dynamics of the underlying microtubule network.\nFinally, we discuss some still open questions.\n", "  The energy levels of the fermions bound to the vortex are considered for\nvortices in the superfluid/superconducting systems which contain the symmetry\nprotected plane of zeroes in the gap function in bulk. The Caroli-de\nGennes-Matricon branches with different angular momentum quantum number $n$\napproach zero energy level at $p_z\\rightarrow 0$. Such condensation of the\nenergy levels is the consequence of the bulk-vortex correspondence in\ntopological superfluids/superconductors. In a given case this is the connection\nbetween the Dirac line of zeroes in the bulk spectrum and the level\ncondensation in the vortex core. The density of states of the bound fermions\ndiverges at zero energy giving rise to the $\\sqrt{\\Omega}$ dependence of DoS in\nthe polar phase of superfluid $^3$He rotating with the angular velocity\n$\\Omega$ and to the $\\sqrt{B}$ dependence of DoS for superconductors in the\n$(d_{xz} + i d_{yz})$-wave pairing state.\n", "  Dedicated to the memory of Raymond Stora (1930-2015). In the $SU(2)_L\\times\nSU(2)_R$ Linear Sigma Model with PCAC, towers of Ward-Takahashi Identities\n(WTI) have long been known to give relations among\n1-Scalar-Particle-Irreducible Green's functions, and among I-\nScalar-Particle-Reducible T-Matrix elements, for external scalars (i.e. the\nBrout-Englert-Higgs scalar and 3 pseudoscalars). We extend these WTI and the\nresulting relations to the $SU(3)_C\\times SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ Linear Sigma\nModel including the heaviest generation of Standard Model (SM) fermions\nsupplemented with the minimum necessary neutrino content -- right-handed\nneutrinos and Yukawa-coupling-induced Dirac neutrino mass. We extract powerful\nconstraints on the effective Lagrangian: e.g. showing that they make separate\ntadpole renormalization unnecessary, and guarantee infra-red finiteness.\nCrucially, ultra-violet quadratic divergences (UVQD) and all other relevant\noperators contribute only to $m_\\pi^2$, a Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB)\nmass-squared. A WTI between T-Matrix elements (i.e. the Goldstone Theorem) then\nenforces $ m_\\pi^2=0$ for the true NGB in the spontaneous symmetry breaking\nmode of the theory. All relevant operator contributions originating to\nall-loop-orders from virtual scalars, quarks and leptons, vanish identically!\n  Our regularization-scheme-independent results are unchanged by the addition\nof certain heavy CP-conserving matter, such as originate in certain Beyond the\nSM models. We demonstrate this with two examples: a heavy singlet real scalar\nfield with $Z_2$ symmetry and no VEV; and a heavy singlet right-handed Type I\nSee-saw Majorana neutrino. Specifically, we prove that these heavy degrees of\nfreedom decouple completely from the low-energy effective Lagrangian,\ncontributing only irrelevant operators after quartic-coupling renormalization.\n", "  We report a computational study of the adsorption of zoledronic acid molecule\non hydroxyapatite (001) surface within ab initio density functional theory. The\nsystematic study has been performed, from hydroxyapatite bulk and surface, and\nzoledronic acid molecule to the adsorption of the molecule on the surface. The\noptimized bond lengths and bond angles were obtained and analyzed, giving an\nevidence of structural similarity between subjects under study. The formation\nenergies of hydroxyapatite (001) surfaces with two kinds of terminations were\ncomputed as about 1.2 and 1.5 J/m^2 with detailed atomistic structural\ninformation. We determined the adsorption energies of zoledronic acid molecule\non the surfaces, which are -260 kJ/mol at 0.25 ML and -400 kJ/mol at 0.5 ML. An\natomistic insight of strong binding affinity of zoledronic acid to the\nhydroxyapatite surface was given and discussed.\n", "  It is shown that the gap solution and critical transition temperature are\nsignificantly enhanced by doping in a recently developed BCS formalism for\ngraphene superconductivity in such a way that positive gap and transition\ntemperature both occur in arbitrary pairing coupling as far as doping is\npresent. The analytic construction of the BCS gap and transition temperature\noffers highly effective globally convergent iterative methods for the\ncomputation of these quantities. A series of numerical examples are presented\nas illustrations consolidating the analytic understanding achieved.\n", "  We give an introductory review of gauge/gravity duality, and associated ideas\nof holography, emphasising the conceptual aspects. The opening Sections gather\nthe ingredients, viz. anti-de Sitter spacetime, conformal field theory and\nstring theory, that we need for presenting, in Section 5, the central and\noriginal example: Maldacena's AdS/CFT correspondence. Sections 6 and 7 develop\nthe ideas of this example, also in applications to condensed matter systems,\nQCD, and hydrodynamics. Sections 8 and 9 discuss the possible extensions of\nholographic ideas to de Sitter spacetime and to black holes. Section 10\ndiscusses the bearing of gauge/gravity duality on two philosophical topics: the\nequivalence of physical theories, and the idea that spacetime, or some features\nof it, are emergent.\n", "  We present a numerical study of a confined ultracold Fermi gas showing that\nthe Goldstone mode of the BCS gap is directly visible in the dynamics of the\nsingle-particle excitations. To this end, we investigate the low-energy dynamic\nresponse of a confined Fermi gas to a rapid change of the scattering length\n(i.e., an interaction quench). Based on a fully microscopic time-dependent\ndensity-matrix approach within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism that includes\na 3D harmonic confinement we simulate and identify the emergence of the\nGoldstone mode in a cigar-shaped $^6$Li gas. We show that the quench leads to a\nlow-frequency in-phase oscillation of the single-particle occupations. Complete\ninversion is achieved for occupations corresponding to the lowest-lying\nsingle-particle states.\n", "  Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) cosmic-ray (CR) fluxes from satellites and\nballoon-borne experiments are snapshots of the solar activity imprinted on the\ninterstellar (IS) fluxes. Given a series of snapshots, the unknown IS flux\nshape and the level of modulation (for each snapshot) can be recovered. We wish\n(i) to provide the most accurate determination of the IS H and He fluxes from\nTOA data alone, (ii) to obtain the associated modulation levels (and\nuncertainties) while fully accounting for the correlations with the IS flux\nuncertainties, and (iii) to inspect whether the minimal force-field\napproximation is sufficient to explain all the data at hand. Using H and He TOA\nmeasurements, including the recent high-precision AMS, BESS-Polar, and PAMELA\ndata, we performed a non-parametric fit of the IS fluxes $J^{\\rm IS}_{\\rm\nH,~He}$ and modulation level $\\phi_i$ for each data-taking period. We relied on\na Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) engine to extract the probability density\nfunction and correlations (hence the credible intervals) of the sought\nparameters. Although H and He are the most abundant and best measured CR\nspecies, several datasets had to be excluded from the analysis because of\ninconsistencies with other measurements. From the subset of data passing our\nconsistency cut, we provide ready-to-use best-fit and credible intervals for\nthe H and He IS fluxes from MeV/n to PeV/n energy (with a relative precision in\nthe range [2-10\\%] at 1$\\sigma$). Given the strong correlation between $J^{\\rm\nIS}$ and $\\phi_i$ parameters, the uncertainties on $J^{\\rm IS}$ translate into\n$\\Delta\\phi\\approx \\pm 30$~MV (at 1$\\sigma$) for all experiments. We also find\nthat the presence of $^3$He in He data biases $\\phi$ towards higher $\\phi$\nvalues by $\\sim 30$~MV. The force-field approximation gives an excellent\n($\\chi^2/$dof$=1.02$) description of the recent high-precision TOA H and He\nfluxes.\n", "  A novel large volume spherical proportional counter, recently developed, is\nused for neutron measurements. Gas mixtures of $N_{2}$ with $C_{2}H_{6}$ and\npure $N_{2}$ are studied for thermal and fast neutron detection, providing a\nnew way for the neutron spectroscopy. The neutrons are detected via the\n${}^{14}N(n, p)C^{14}$ and ${}^{14}N(n, \\alpha)B^{11}$ reactions. Here we\nprovide studies of the optimum gas mixture, the gas pressure and the most\nappropriate high voltage supply on the sensor of the detector in order to\nachieve the maximum amplification and better resolution. The detector is tested\nfor thermal and fast neutrons detection with a ${}^{252}Cf$ and a\n${}^{241}Am-{}^{9}Be$ neutron source. The atmospheric neutrons are successfully\nmeasured from thermal up to several MeV, well separated from the cosmic ray\nbackground. A comparison of the spherical proportional counter with the current\navailable neutron counters is also given.\n", "  Using density functional theory with the inclusion of van der Waals (vdW)\ninteraction, we have investigated electronic energy bands, density of states,\neffective masses of charge carriers, and photo absorption coefficients of\npseudo-cubic CH$_3$NH$_3$PbX$_3$ (X=I, Br). Our results confirm the direct\nbandgap of 1.49 (1.92) eV for X=I (Br) in the pseudo-cubic $Pm$ phase with\nlattice constant of 6.324 (5.966) \\AA, being agreed well with experiment and\nindicating the necessity of vdW correction. The calculated photo absorption\ncoefficients for X=I (Br) have the onset at red (orange) color and the first\npeak around violet (ultraviolet) color in overall agreement with the\nexperiment.\n", "  Motivated by recent interest in implementing circuit quantum electrodynamics\nwith semiconducting quantum dots, we consider a double quantum dot (DQD)\ncapacitively coupled to a superconducting resonator that is driven by the\nmicrowave field of a superconducting transmission line. We analyze the DQD\ncurrent response using input-output theory and show that the resonator-coupled\nDQD is a sensitive microwave single photon detector. Using currently available\nexperimental parameters of DQD-resonator coupling and dissipation, including\nthe effects of $1/f$ charge noise and phonon noise, we determine the parameter\nregime for which incident photons are completely absorbed and near unit\n$\\gtrsim$ 98\\% efficiency can be achieved. We show that this regime can be\nreached by using very high quality resonators with quality factor $Q\\simeq\n10^5$.\n", "  Using density functional theory calculations, we have investigated the\nstructural, energetic, and electronic properties of ternary graphite\nintercalation compounds (GICs) containing alkali atoms (AM) and normal\nalkylamine molecules (nC$x$), denoted as AM-nC$x$-GICs (AM=Li, Na, K, $x$=1, 2,\n3, 4). The orthorhombic unit cells have been used to build the models for\ncrystalline stage-I AM-nC$x$-GICs. By performing the variable cell relaxations\nand the analysis of results, we have found that with the increase in the atomic\nnumber of alkali atoms the layer separations decreases in contrast to AM-GICs,\nwhile the bond lengths of alkali atoms with graphene layer and nitrogen atom of\nalkylamine decreases. The formation and interlayer binding energies of\nAM-nC3-GICs have been calculated, indicating the increase in stability from Li\nto K. The calculated energy barriers for migration of alkali atoms suggest that\nalkali cation with larger ionic radius diffuses in graphite more smoothly,\nbeing similar to AM-GICs. The analysis of density of states, electronic density\ndifferences, and atomic populations illustrates a mechanism how the insertion\nof especially Na among alkali atoms into graphite with first stage can be made\neasy by cointercalation with alkylamine, more extent of electronic charge\ntransfer is occurred from more electropositive alkali atom to carbon ring of\ngraphene layer, while alkylamine molecules interact strongly with graphene\nlayer through the hybridization of valence electron orbitals.\n", "  Optical injection and detection of charge currents can complement\nconventional transport and photoemission measurements without the necessity of\ninvasive contact that may disturb the system being examined. This is a\nparticular concern for the surface states of a topological insulator. In this\nwork one- and two-color sources of photocurrents are examined in epitaxial,\nthin films of Bi2Se3. We demonstrate that optical excitation and terahertz\ndetection simultaneously captures one- and two- color photocurrent\ncontributions, as previously not required in other material systems. A method\nis devised to isolate the two components, and in doing so each can be related\nto surface or bulk excitations through symmetry. This strategy allows surface\nstates to be examined in a model system, where they have independently been\nverified with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.\n", "  Weak value measurements have recently given rise to a large interest for both\nthe possibility of measurement amplification and the chance of further quantum\nmechanics foundations investigation. In particular, a question emerged about\nweak values being proof of the incompatibility between Quantum Mechanics and\nNon-Contextual Hidden Variables Theories (NCHVT). A test to provide a\nconclusive answer to this question was given in [M. Pusey, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n113, 200401 (2014)], where a theorem was derived showing the NCHVT\nincompatibility with the observation of anomalous weak values under specific\nconditions. In this paper we realize this proposal, clearly pointing out the\nstrict connection between weak values and the contextual nature of Quantum\nMechanics.\n", "  It is long known that the best single-site coherent potential approximation\n(CPA) falls short of describing Anderson localization (AL). Here, we study a\nbinary alloy disorder (or equivalently, a spinless Falicov-Kimball (FK)) model\nand construct a dominantly analytic cluster extension that treats intra-cluster\n($1/d$, $d$=spatial dimension) correlations exactly. We find that, in general,\nthe irreducible two-particle vertex exhibits clear non-analyticities before the\nband-splitting transition of the Hubbard type occurs, signaling onset of an\nunusual type of localization at strong coupling. Using time-dependent response\nto a sudden local quench as a diagnostic, we find that the long-time wave\nfunction overlap changes from a power-law to an anomalous form at strong\ncoupling, lending additional support to this idea. Our results also imply such\nnovel \"strong\" localization in the equivalent FK model, the simplest\ninteracting fermion system.\n", "  In many species, sucrose en route out of the leaf migrates from\nphotosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its\nconcentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e., symplastically. In some of\nthese plants the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem sucrose is\nactively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated\n(trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than\nin the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective\nadvantages conferred by both of these symplastic loading processes. Here we\npresent an integrated model - including local and global transport and the\nkinetics of oligomerization - for passive and active symplastic loading. We\nalso propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With\nthese models, we predict that: 1) relative to passive loading, oligomerization\nof sucrose in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar\ncontent in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates\nexport for a given concentration of sucrose in the mesophyll; and 2)\nsegregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can\nbe achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher\nexport rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to\ndiffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to\nfurther studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of\nactive and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering\nimproved rates of export.\n", "  We investigate the ferrimagnetism and ferroelectricity of bulk NiFe$_2$O$_4$\nwith tetragonal $P4_122$ ~symmetry by means of density functional calculations\nusing generalized gradient approximation + Hubbard $U$ approach. Special\nattention is paid to finding the most energetically favorable configuration on\nmagnetic ordering and further calculating the reliable spontaneous electric\npolarization. With the fully optimized crystalline structure of the most stable\nconfiguration, the spontaneous polarization is obtained to be 23 $\\mu$C/cm$^2$\nalong the z direction, which originates from the hybridization between the 3d\nstates of the Fe$^{3+}$ cation and the 2p states of oxygen induced by\nJahn-Teller effect.\n", "  Based on first-principles calculations, we find that LiZnBi, a metallic\nhexagonal $ABC$ compound, can be driven into a Dirac semimetal with a pair of\nDirac points by strain. The nontrivial topological nature of the strained\nLiZnBi is directly demonstrated by calculating its $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and the\nsurface states, where the Fermi arcs are clearly observed. The low-energy\nstates as well as topological properties are shown to be sensitive to the\nstrain configurations. The finding of Dirac semimetal phase in LiZnBi may\nintrigue further researches on the topological properties of hexagonal $ABC$\nmaterials and promote new practical applications.\n", "  Using density functional theory calculations, we have investigated the\ninterlayer cation exchange phenomena in muscovite mica, which is motivated by a\nnecessity to develop flexible high-insulating covering materials. The\ncrystalline structures, chemical bonding properties, energetics, and electronic\nproperties of muscovites before and after exchange of interlayer K$^+$ cation\nwith ammonium (NH$_4^+$) or methylammonium (CH$_3$NH$_3^+$) ion were\ncalculated. It was found that the unit cell volume changes are negligibly small\nupon exchange with NH$_4^+$ ion, while the unit cells are expanded with about 4\n\\% relative rate when replacing the interlayer K$^+$ cation with CH$_3$NH$_3^+$\nion. The energy band gap of pre-exchanged muscovite was calculated to be about\n5 eV, which hardly changes upon interlayer cation exchange with either NH$_4^+$\nor CH$_3$NH$_3^+$ ion, indicating the preservation of high insulating property\nof muscovite. The exchange energies were found to be about -100 kJ/mol for\nNH$_4^+$ and about -50 kJ/mol for CH$_3$NH$_3^+$ exchange, indicating that the\nexchange reactions are exothermic. A detailed analysis of atomic resolved\ndensity of states and electron density redistribution was provided.\n", "  The irreversibility of the renormalization group flow is conjectured to be\nclosely related to the concept of entropy. In this paper, the variation of\neigenvalues of the Laplacian in the Polyakov action under the renormalization\ngroup flow will be studied. Based on the one-loop approximation to the\neffective field theory, we will use the heat kernel method and zeta function\nregularization. In even dimensions, the variation of eigenvalues is given by\nthe top heat kernel coefficient, and the conformal anomaly is relevant. In odd\ndimensions, we will conjecture a formula for the variation of eigenvalues\nthrough the holographic renormalization in the setting of geometric AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence.\n", "  We study the nonperturbative formulation of quantum gravity defined via\nEuclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT) in an attempt to make contact with\nWeinberg's asymptotic safety scenario. We find that a fine-tuning is necessary\nin order to recover semiclassical behavior. Such a fine-tuning is generally\nassociated with the breaking of a target symmetry by the lattice regulator; in\nthis case we argue that the target symmetry is the general coordinate\ninvariance of the theory. After introducing and fine-tuning a nontrivial local\nmeasure term, we find no barrier to taking a continuum limit, and we find\nevidence that four-dimensional, semiclassical geometries are recovered at long\ndistance scales in the continuum limit. We also find that the spectral\ndimension at short distance scales is consistent with 3/2, a value that could\nresolve the tension between asymptotic safety and the holographic entropy\nscaling of black holes. We argue that the number of relevant couplings in the\ncontinuum theory is one, once symmetry breaking by the lattice regulator is\naccounted for. Such a theory is maximally predictive, with no adjustable\nparameters. The cosmological constant in Planck units is the only relevant\nparameter, which serves to set the lattice scale. The cosmological constant in\nPlanck units is of order 1 in the ultraviolet and undergoes renormalization\ngroup running to small values in the infrared. If these findings hold up under\nfurther scrutiny, the lattice may provide a nonperturbative definition of a\nrenormalizable quantum field theory of general relativity with no adjustable\nparameters and a cosmological constant that is naturally small in the infrared.\n", "  We review a non-standard Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) scenario within the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model, and propose an idea to solve both\n${}^{7}$Li and ${}^{6}$Li problems. Each problem is a discrepancy between the\npredicted abundance in the standard BBN and observed one. We focus on the stau,\na supersymmetric partner of tau lepton, which is a long-lived charged particle\nwhen it is the next lightest supersymmetric particle and is degenerate in mass\nwith the lightest supersymmetric particle. The long-lived stau forms a bound\nstate with a nucleus, and provide non-standard nuclear reactions. One of those,\nthe internal conversion process, accelerates the destruction of ${}^{7}$Be and\n${}^{7}$Li, and leads to a solution to the ${}^{7}$Li problem. On the other\nhand, the bound state of the stau and ${}^{4}$He enhances productions of n, d,\nt, and ${}^{6}$Li. The over-production of ${}^{6}$Li could solve the ${}^{6}$Li\nproblem. While, the over-productions of d and t could conflict with\nobservations, and the relevant parameter space of the stau is strictly\nconstrained. We therefore need to carefully investigate the stau-${}^{4}$He\nbound state to find a condition of solving the ${}^{6}$Li problem. The scenario\nof the long-lived stau simultaneously and successfully fit the abundances of\nlight elements (d, t, ${}^{3}$He, ${}^{4}$He, ${}^{6}$Li, and ${}^{7}$Li) and\nthe neutralino dark matter to the observed ones. Consequently parameter space\nboth of the stau and the neutralino is determined with excellent accuracy.\n", "  In \"On the Heavens\" Aristotle criticizes the Pythagorean point of view which\nclaims the existence of a cosmic music and a cosmic sound. According to the\nPythagorean argument, there exists a cosmic music produced by stars and\nplanets. These celestial bodies generate sound in its movements, and the music\nappears due to the cosmic harmony. For Aristotle, there is no sound produced by\ncelestial bodies. Then, there is no music as well. However, recently, LIGO\n(Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Waves Observatory) has detected the\ngravitational waves predicted by Einstein. In some sense, a sound originated\nfrom black holes has been heard. That is, Einstein or the General Relativity\nand LIGO appear to be with the Pythagoreanism and against the master of the\nLyceum.\n", "  Zahn (1975) first put forward and calculated in detail the torque experienced\nby stars in a close binary systems due to dynamical tides. His widely used\nformula for stars with radiative envelopes and convective cores is expressed in\nterms of the stellar radius, even though the torque is actually being applied\nto the convective core at the core radius. This results in a large prefactor,\nwhich is very sensitive to the global properties of the star, that multiplies\nthe torque. This large factor is compensated by a very small multiplicative\nfactor, $E_{2}$. Although this is mathematically accurate, depending on the\napplication this can lead to significant errors. The problem is even more\nsevere, since the calculation of $E_{2}$ itself is non-trivial, and different\nauthors have obtained inconsistent values of $E_{2}$. Moreover, many codes\n(e.g. BSE, StarTrack, MESA) interpolate (and sometimes extrapolate) a fit of\n$E_{2}$ values to the stellar mass, often in regimes where this is not sound\npractice. We express the torque in an alternate form, cast in terms of\nparameters at the envelope-core boundary and a dimensionless coefficient,\n$\\beta_{2}$. Previous attempts to express the torque in such a form are either\nmissing an important factor, which depends on the density profile of the star,\nor are not easy to implement. We show that $\\beta_{2}$ is almost independent of\nthe properties of the star and its value is approximately unity. Our formula\nfor the torque is simple to implement and avoids the difficulties associated\nwith the classic expression.\n", "  Discovering new electrodes for sodium-ion battery requires clear\nunderstanding of the material process during battery operation. Using\nfirst-principles calculations, we identify mechanisms of ionic diffusion and\nelectronic transfer in newly developed cathode material, eldfellite\nNa$_x$Fe(SO$_4$)$_2$, reproducing the electrochemical properties in good\nagreement with experiment. The inserted sodium atom is suggested to diffuse\nalong the two-dimensional pathway with preceding movement of the host sodium\natom, and the activation energy is calculated to be reasonable for fast\ninsertion. We calculate the electronic properties, showing the band insulating\nat low composition of inserted sodium, for which the electron polaron formation\nand hoping are also suggested. Our results may contribute to opening a new way\nof developing innovative cathode materials based on iron and sulfate ion.\n", "  When a supernova explodes, most of its energy is released in a shell of\nrelativistic neutirnos which changes the surrounding geometry. We calculate the\npotentially observable responses to such a change in both pulsar scintillation\nand conventional interferometers. In both cases, the responses are permanent\nchanges due to such a transient event. This is by-definition a memory effect.\nIn addition to the transverse component in the usual gravitational memory\n(Christodolou effect) effect, it also has a longitudinal component. Furthermore\nit is different from the Christodolou effect as the transverse component of\nthis memory effect also has a term that grows with time.\n", "  Cooling vibrational degrees of freedom down to ground states is essential to\nobservation of quantum properties of systems with mechanical vibration. We\npropose two cooling schemes employing four internal levels of the systems,\nwhich achieve the ground-state cooling in an efficient fashion by completely\ndeleting the carrier and first-order blue-sideband transitions. The schemes,\nbased on the quantum interference and Stark-shift gates, are robust to\nfluctuation of laser intensity and frequency. The feasibility of the schemes is\njustified using current laboratory technology. In practice, our proposal\nreadily applies to an nano-diamond nitrogen-vacancy center levitated in an\noptic trap or attached to a cantilever.\n", "  We present low energy recoil detection results in the keV energy region, from\nmeasurements performed with the Spherical Proportional Counter (SPC). An\n${}^{241}Am-{}^{9}{Be}$ fast neutron source is used in order to obtain\nneutron-nucleus elastic scattering events inside the gaseous volume of the\ndetector. The detector performance in the $keV$ energy region was resolved by\nobserving the $5.9\\ keV$ line of a ${}^{55}Fe$ X-ray source, with energy\nresolution of $9\\%$ ($\\sigma$). The toolkit GEANT4 was used to simulate the\nirradiation of the detector by an ${}^{241}Am-{}^{9}{Be}$ source, while SRIM\nwas used to calculate the Ionization Quenching Factor (IQF). The GEANT4\nsimulated energy deposition spectrum in addition with the SRIM calculated\nquenching factor provide valuable insight to the experimental results. The\nperformance of the SPC in low energy recoil detection makes the detector a good\ncandidate for a wide range of applications, including Supernova or reactor\nneutrino detection and Dark Matter (WIMP) searches (via coherent elastic\nscattering).\n", "  In an ensemble of identical atoms, cooperative effects like sub- or\nsuperradiance may alter the decay rates and the energy of specific transitions\nmay be shifted from the single-atom value by the so-called collective Lamb\nshift. While such effects in ensembles of two-level systems are by now well\nunderstood, realistic multi-level systems are more difficult to handle. In this\nwork we show that in a system of atoms or nuclei under the action of an\nexternal magnetic field, the collective contribution to the level shifts can\namount to seizable deviations from the single-atom Zeeman or magnetic hyperfine\nsplitting picture. We develop a formalism to describe single-photon\nsuperradiance in multi-level systems in the small sample limit and quantify the\nparameter regime for which the collective Lamb shift leads to measurable\ndeviations in the magnetic-field-induced splitting. In particular, we show that\nthis effect should be observable in the nuclear magnetic hyperfine splitting in\nM\\\"ossbauer nuclei embedded in thin-film x-ray cavities.\n", "  The direct problem of optoacoustic signal generation in biological media\nconsists of solving the inhomogeneous optoacoustic wave equation for an initial\nacoustic stress profile. In contrast, the mathematically challenging inverse\nproblem requires the reconstruction of the initial stress profile from a proper\nset of observed signals. In this article, we consider the particular case of a\nGaussian transverse irradiation source profile in the paraxial approximation of\nthe wave equation, for which the direct problem along the beam axis can be cast\ninto a linear Volterra integral equation of the second kind. This integral\nequation can be used in two ways: as a forward solver to predict optoacoustic\nsignals in terms of the direct problem, and as an inverse solver for which we\nhere devise highly efficient numerical schemes used for the reconstruction of\ninitial pressure profiles from observed signals, constituting a methodical\nprogress of computational aspects of optoacoustics. In this regard, we explore\nthe validity as well as the limits of the inversion scheme via numerical\nexperiments, with parameters geared towards actual optoacoustic problem\ninstances. The considered inversion input consists of synthetic data, obtained\nby means of forward solvers based on the Volterra integral, and, more\ngenerally, the optoacoustic Poisson integral. Regarding the latter, we\nnumerically invert signals that correspond to different detector-to-sample\ndistances and assess the convergence to the true initial stress profiles upon\napproaching the far-field. Finally, we also address the effect of noise on the\nquality of the reconstructed pressure profiles.\n", "  We introduce topological non-trivial colorful regions around intersection\npoints of two perpendicular vortex pairs and investigate their influence on\ntopological charge density and eigenmodes of the Dirac operator. With\nincreasing distance between the vortices the eigenvalues of the lowest modes\ndecrease. We show that the maxima and minima of the chiral densities of the low\nmodes follow mainly the distributions of the topological charge densities. The\ntopological non-trivial color structures lead in some low modes to distinct\npeaks in the chiral densities. The other low modes reflect the topological\ncharge densities of the intersection points.\n", "  We predicted that AMgBi (A=K,Rb Cs), which have the same lattice structures\nas the 111 family of iron-based superconductors (Na/LiFeAs), are\nsymmetry-protected Dirac semimetals located near the boundary of type-I and\ntype-II Dirac semimetal phases. Doping Rb or Cs into KMgBi can drive the\ntransition between the two phases. The materials can also be turned into Weyl\nsemimetals and topological insulators by explicitly or spontaneously breaking\ntime-reversal symmetry and C$_4$ lattice symmetry respectively.\n", "  The Bessel-inspired behavior of parton densities at small x, obtained in the\ncase of the flat initial conditions for DGLAP evolution equations, is used in\nthe fixed flavor scheme to analyze precise H1+ZEUS combined data on the\nstructure function F2.\n", "  In his recent article [arXiv:1604.04950], Adler questions the usefulness of\nthe bound found in our experimental search for genuine effects of hyper-complex\nquantum mechanics [arXiv:1602.01624]. Our experiment was performed using a\nblack-box (instrumentalist) approach to generalized probabilistic theories;\ntherefore, it does not assume a priori any particular underlying mechanism.\nFrom that point of view our experimental results do indeed place meaningful\nbounds on possible effects of \"post-quantum theories\", including quaternionic\nquantum mechanics. In his article, Adler compares our experiment to\nnon-relativistic and M\\\"oller formal scattering theory within quaternionic\nquantum mechanics. With a particular set of assumptions, he finds that\nquaternionic effects would likely not manifest themselves in general. Although\nthese assumptions are justified in the non-relativistic case, a proper\ncalculation for relativistic particles is still missing. Here, we provide a\nconcrete relativistic example of Klein-Gordon scattering wherein the\nquaternionic effects persist. We note that when the Klein-Gordon equation is\nformulated using a Hamiltonian formalism it displays a so-called \"indefinite\nmetric\", a characteristic feature of relativistic quantum wave equations. In\nAdler's example this is directly forbidden by his assumptions, and therefore\nour present example is not in contradiction to his work. In complex quantum\nmechanics this problem of an indefinite metric is solved in second\nquantization. Unfortunately, there is no known algorithm for canonical field\nquantization in quaternionic quantum mechanics.\n", "  We will follow the growth of gravitational theory in Germany from 1915 to the\n1990s, i.e., relativistic theories of gravitation, mainly Einstein's, as a\nbranch of physics in the sense of social, more precisely institutional history.\nAs criteria for a continued professionalizing of the field, we use the numbers\nof published research papers, reviews, monographs, courses at universities,\nappointments of lecturers or professors as well as the status of those involved\n(members of academies). The foundation of special institutes for gravitational\nresearch and of particular divisions of physical societies forms the final\nstage of this process of institutionalization. At present, an\ninstitutionalization of research in relativistic gravitation has been achieved\nin Germany through a thriving topical section \"Relativity and Gravitation\" of\nthe German Physical Society and a Max-Planck-Institute for Gravitational\nPhysics. While an institutionalization of the field became achieved, the\nsituation for young German relativists for entering into research in the field\nwas not noticeably improved. Much of research in general relativity still is\ndone at universities in rather small groups, the continuity of which is not\nguaranteed.\n", "  The spreading of a cloud of independent Brownian particles typically proceeds\nmore effectively at higher temperatures, as it derives from the commonly known\nSutherland-Einstein relation for systems in thermal equilibrium. Here, we\nreport on a non-equilibrium situation in which the diffusion of a periodically\ndriven Brownian particle moving in a periodic potential decreases with\nincreasing temperature within a finite temperature window. We identify as the\ncause for this non-intuitive behaviour a dominant deterministic mechanism\nconsisting of a few unstable periodic orbits embedded into a chaotic attractor\ntogether with thermal noise-induced dynamical changes upon varying temperature.\nThe presented analysis is based on extensive numerical simulations of the\ncorresponding Langevin equation describing the studied setup as well as on a\nsimplified stochastic model formulated in terms of a three-state Markovian\nprocess. Because chaos exists in many natural as well as in artificial systems\nrepresenting abundant areas of contemporary knowledge, the described mechanism\nmay potentially be discovered in plentiful different contexts.\n", "  A quantisation of the KP equation on a cylinder is proposed that is\nequivalent to an infinite system of non-relativistic one-dimensional bosons\ncarrying masses $m=1,2,\\ldots$ The Hamiltonian is Galilei-invariant and\nincludes the split $\\Psi^\\dagger_{m_1}\\Psi^\\dagger_{m_2}\\Psi_{m_1+m_2}$ and\nmerge $\\Psi^\\dagger_{m_1+m_2}\\Psi_{m_1}\\Psi_{m_2}$ terms for all combinations\nof particles with masses $m_1$, $m_2$ and $m_1+m_2$, with a special choice of\ncoupling constants. The Bethe eigenfunctions for the model are constructed. The\nconsistency of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz, and therefore, the quantum\nintegrability of the model is verified up to the mass $M=8$ sector.\n", "  Network science is a powerful tool for analyzing complex systems in fields\nranging from sociology to engineering to biology. This paper is focused on\ngenerative models of large-scale bipartite graphs, also known as two-way graphs\nor two-mode networks. We propose two generative models that can be easily tuned\nto reproduce the characteristics of real-world networks, not just\nqualitatively, but quantitatively. The characteristics we consider are the\ndegree distributions and the metamorphosis coefficient. The metamorphosis\ncoefficient, a bipartite analogue of the clustering coefficient, is the\nproportion of length-three paths that participate in length-four cycles. Having\na high metamorphosis coefficient is a necessary condition for close-knit\ncommunity structure. We define edge, node, and degreewise metamorphosis\ncoefficients, enabling a more detailed understanding of the bipartite\nconnectivity that is not explained by degree distribution alone. Our first\nmodel, bipartite Chung-Lu (CL), is able to reproduce real-world degree\ndistributions, and our second model, bipartite block two-level Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi\n(BTER), reproduces both the degree distributions as well as the degreewise\nmetamorphosis coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on\nseveral real-world data sets.\n", "  Improving reactivity on an insulating surface is crucial due to their\nimportant applications in surface catalytic reactions. In this work, we carried\nout first-principles calculations to investigate the adsorption of O2 on a\nsingle-layer MgO(100) film deposited on metal substrate. The adsorption\nconfigurations, reaction pathways, molecular dynamics simulations, and\nelectronic properties are reported. We reveal that O2 can completely dissociate\non the surface, which is in sharp contrast to that on MgO(100) films thicker\nthan one monolayer. The dissociated O2 tends to penetrate into the interfacial\nregion, behaving like a switch to trigger subsequent chemical reactions. As an\nexample, the interplay between water and the interfacial oxygen results in the\nformation of hydroxyl radicals. This study paves an avenue to accomplish the\ndesired surface catalytic reactions, especially those involving oxygen.\n", "  Spintronics, which utilizes spin as information carrier, is a promising\nsolution for nonvolatile memory and low-power computing in the post-Moore era.\nAn important challenge is to realize long distance spin transport, together\nwith efficient manipulation of spin current for novel logic-processing\napplications. Here, we describe a gate-variable spin current demultiplexer\n(GSDM) based on graphene, serving as a fundamental building block of\nreconfigurable spin current logic circuits. The concept relies on electrical\ngating of carrier density dependent conductivity and spin diffusion length in\ngraphene. As a demo, GSDM is realized for both single-layer and bilayer\ngraphene. The distribution and propagation of spin current in the two branches\nof GSDM depend on spin relaxation characteristics of graphene. Compared with\nElliot-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism, D'yakonov-Perel mechanism results in\nmore appreciable gate-tuning performance. These unique features of GSDM would\ngive rise to abundant spin logic applications, such as on-chip spin current\nmodulators and reconfigurable spin logic circuits.\n", "  Using evolutionary algorithm and first-principles calculations, we predict a\nfamily group of two-dimensional node-line semimetals MX (M=Pd, Pt; X=S, Se,\nTe), which has zig-zag type mono-layer structure in Pmm2 layer group. Band\nstructure analysis reveals that node-line features are caused by band inversion\nand the inversion exists even in the absence of spin-orbital-coupling. Tests\nare carried out to confirm that the node-line loop is protected by crystal\nsymmetry. This work extends our knowledge of node-line materials to\ntwo-dimensional cases, i.e., a group of metal-group VI compounds sharing the\nsame lattice structure which has time reversion and crystal-mirror inversion\nsymmetries.\n", "  We present the first calculation of the momentum sharing and angular\nseparation distributions between the leading subjets inside a reconstructed jet\nin heavy ion collisions. These observables are directly sensitive to the\nhardest branching in the process of jet formation and are, therefore, ideal for\nstudying the early stage of the in-medium parton shower evolution. The\nmodification of the momentum sharing and angular separation distributions in\nlead-lead relative to proton-proton collisions is evaluated using the\nleading-order medium-induced splitting functions obtained in the framework of\nsoft-collinear effective theory with Glauber gluon interactions. Qualitative\nand in most cases quantitative agreement between theory and preliminary CMS\nmeasurements suggests that the parton shower in heavy ion collisions can be\ndramatically modified early in the branching history. We propose a new\nmeasurement which will illuminate the angular distribution of the hardest\nbranching within jets in heavy ion collisions.\n", "  The Nobel prize in physics 2015 has been awarded \"... for the discovery of\nneutrino oscillations which show that neutrinos have mass\". While\nSuperKamiokande (SK), indeed, has discovered oscillations, SNO observed effect\nof the adiabatic (almost non-oscillatory) flavor conversion of neutrinos in the\nmatter of the Sun. Oscillations are irrelevant for solar neutrinos apart from\nsmall $\\nu_e$ regeneration inside the Earth. Both oscillations and adiabatic\nconversion do not imply masses uniquely and further studies were required to\nshow that non-zero neutrino masses are behind the SNO results. Phenomena of\noscillations (phase effect) and adiabatic conversion (the MSW effect driven by\nthe change of mixing in matter) are described in pedagogical way.\n", "  The talk is devoted to the problem of stability of the Standard Model vacuum.\nThe effective potential for the Higgs field, which can potentialy exhibit\nadditional, deeper minimum, is considered as a convenient tool for addressing\nthe problem. Different methods and approximations used to calculate the\npotential are considered. Special attention is paid to the renomalization-group\napproach that allows one to carry out three-loop analysis of the problem. By\nmeans of an explicit gauge-independent procedure the absolute stability bounds\non the observed Higgs and top-quark masses are derived. The importance of\nhigh-order corrections is demonstrated. In addition, potential metastablity of\nthe SM is discussed together with modifications of the analysis due to some New\nPhysics.\n", "  We study nanodevices based on ultrathin superconducting nanowires connected\nin parallel to form nanowire SQUIDs. The function of the critical current\nversus magnetic field, $I_{C}(B)$, is multivalued, asymmetric and its maxima\nand minima are shifted from the usual integer and half integer flux quantum\npoints. The nanowire interference device is qualitatively distinct from\nconventional SQUIDs because nanowires do not obey the same current-phase\nrelationship (CPR) as Josephson junctions. We demonstrate that the results can\nbe explained assuming that (i) the CPR is linear and (ii) that each wire is\ncharacterized by a sample-specific critical phase, which is usually much larger\nthan $\\pi/2$. Our proposed model offers accurate fits to $I_{C}(B)$. It\nexplains the single-valuedness regions where only one vorticity (i.e., the\norder parameter winding number) is stable as well as regions where multiple\nvorticity values are allowed for the SQUIDs. We also observe and explain\nregions in which the standard deviation of the switching current is independent\nof the magnetic field. We develop a technique that allows a reliable detection\nof hidden phase-slips. Using this technique we find that our model correctly\npredicts the boundaries of vorticity regions, even at low currents where\n$I_C(B)$ is not directly measurable.\n", "  Magnetic domain walls, which are crucially important in both fundamental\nphysics and technical applications, often have a preference in their form due\nto many different origins, such as the crystalline shape, lattice symmetry, and\nmagnetic anisotropy. We theoretically investigate yet another origin stemming\nfrom the coupling to mobile charges in itinerant magnets. Performing a\nlarge-scale numerical simulation in a minimal model for itinerant magnets,\ni.e., the Kondo lattice model with classical localized spins, we show that the\nshape of magnetic domain walls depends on the electronic band structure and\nelectron filling. While Neel and 120 antiferromagnetic states do not show a\nstrong preference in the shape of domain walls, noncoplanar spin states with\nscalar chiral ordering have distinct directional preferences of the domain\nwalls depending on the electron filling. We find that the directional\npreference is rationalized by the wave-number dependence of the effective\nmagnetic interactions induced by the mobile charges, which are set by the band\nstructure and electron filling. We also observe that, in the noncoplanar chiral\nstates, an electric current is induced along the domain walls owing to the spin\nBerry phase mechanism, with very different spatial distributions depending on\nwhether the bulk state is metallic or insulating.\n", "  We present a model for the dynamical evolution of subhaloes based on an\napproach combining numerical and analytical methods. Our method is based on\ntracking subhaloes in an N-body simulation up to the last point that it can be\nresolved, and applying an analytic prescription for its merger timescale that\ntakes dynamical friction and tidal disruption into account. When applied to\ncosmological N-body simulations with mass resolutions that differ by two orders\nof magnitude, the technique produces halo occupation distributions that agree\nto within 3%.\n", "  We consider the electromagnetic production of positron in collision of slow\nheavy nuclei, with the simultaneously produced electron captured by one of the\nnuclei. The cross-section of the discussed process exceeds essentially the\ncross-section of $e^+e^-$ production.\n", "  Compactifications of 6D superconformal field theories (SCFTs) on\nfour-manifolds generate a large class of novel 2d quantum field theories. We\nconsider in detail the case of the rank one simple non-Higgsable cluster 6D\nSCFTs. On the tensor branch of these theories, the gauge group is simple and\nthere are no matter fields. For compactifications on suitably chosen Kahler\nsurfaces, we present evidence that this provides a method to realize 2d SCFTs\nwith N = (0,2) supersymmetry. In particular, we find that reduction on the\ntensor branch of the 6D SCFT yields a description of the same 2d fixed point\nthat is described in the UV by a gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) in which the\nparameters are promoted to dynamical fields, that is, a \"dynamic GLSM\" (DGLSM).\nConsistency of the model requires the DGLSM to be coupled to additional\nnon-Lagrangian sectors obtained from reduction of the anti-chiral two-form of\nthe 6D theory. These extra sectors include both chiral and anti-chiral\ncurrents, as well as spacetime filling non-critical strings of the 6D theory.\nFor each candidate 2d SCFT, we also extract the left- and right-moving central\ncharges in terms of data of the 6D SCFT and the compactification manifold.\n", "  The Galactic centre is a hotbed of astrophysical activity, with the injection\nof wind material from $\\sim$30 massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars orbiting within\n12\" of the super-massive black hole (SMBH) playing an important role.\nHydrodynamic simulations of such colliding and accreting winds produce a\ncomplex density and temperature structure of cold wind material shocking with\nthe ambient medium, creating a large reservoir of hot, X-ray-emitting gas. This\nwork aims to confront the 3Ms of Chandra X-ray Visionary Program (XVP)\nobservations of this diffuse emission by computing the X-ray emission from\nthese hydrodynamic simulations of the colliding WR winds, amid exploring a\nvariety of SMBH feedback mechanisms. The major success of the model is that it\nreproduces the spectral shape from the 2\"--5\" ring around the SMBH, where most\nof the stellar wind material that is ultimately captured by Sgr A* is\nshock-heated and thermalised. This naturally explains that the hot gas comes\nfrom colliding WR winds, and that the wind speeds of these stars are in general\nwell constrained. The flux level of these spectra, as well as 12\"$\\times$12\"\nimages of 4--9 keV, show the X-ray flux is tied to the SMBH feedback strength;\nstronger feedback clears out more hot gas, thereby decreasing the thermal X-ray\nemission. The model in which Sgr A* produced an intermediate-strength outflow\nduring the last few centuries best matches the observations to within about\n10%, showing SMBH feedback is required to interpret the X-ray emission in this\nregion.\n", "  We present a study of unprecedented statistical power regarding the\nhalo-to-halo variance of dark matter substructure. Using a combination of\nN-body simulations and a semi-analytical model, we investigate the variance in\nsubhalo mass fractions and subhalo occupation numbers, with an emphasis on how\nthese statistics scale with halo formation time. We demonstrate that the\nsubhalo mass fraction, f_sub, is mainly a function of halo formation time, with\nearlier forming haloes having less substructure. At fixed formation redshift,\nthe average f_sub is virtually independent of halo mass, and the mass\ndependence of f_sub is therefore mainly a manifestation of more massive haloes\nassembling later. We compare observational constraints on f_sub from\ngravitational lensing to our model predictions and simulation results. Although\nthe inferred f_sub are substantially higher than the median LCDM predictions,\nthey fall within the 95th percentile due to halo-to-halo variance. We show that\nwhile the halo occupation distribution of subhaloes, P(N|M), is\nsuper-Poissonian for large <N>, a well established result, it becomes\nsub-Poissonian for <N> < 2. Ignoring the non-Poissonity results in systematic\nerrors of the clustering of galaxies of a few percent, and with a complicated\nscale- and luminosity-dependence. Earlier-formed haloes have P(N|M) closer to a\nPoisson distribution, suggesting that the dynamical evolution of subhaloes\ndrives the statistics towards Poissonian. Contrary to a recent claim, the\nnon-Poissonity of subhalo occupation statistics does not vanish by selecting\nhaloes with fixed mass and fixed formation redshift. Finally, we use subhalo\noccupation statistics to put loose constraints on the mass and formation\nredshift of the Milky Way halo. Using observational constraints on the V_max of\nthe most massive satellites, we infer that 0.25<M_vir/10^12M_sun/h<1.4 and\n0.1<z_f<1.4 at 90% confidence.\n", "  We unveil the dynamics of four dimensional chiral gauge-Yukawa theories\nfeaturing several scalar degrees of freedom transforming according to distinct\nrepresentations of the underlying gauge group. We consider generalized\nGeorgi-Glashow and Bars-Yankielowicz theories. We determine, to the maximum\nknown order in perturbation theory, the phase diagram of these theories and\nfurther disentangle their ultraviolet asymptotic nature according to whether\nthey are asymptotically free or safe. We therefore extend the number of\ntheories that are known to be fundamental in the Wilsonian sense to the case of\nchiral gauge theories with scalars.\n", "  The generating function of the second kind bivariate Chebyshev polynomials\nassociated with the simple Lie algebra $G_2$ is constructed by the method\nproposed in \\cite{DKS} and \\cite{DKS1}.\n", "  Basing on the theory for arbitrary oriented surfaces, we developed the theory\nof the moir\\'e effect for cylindrical single-layer objects in the paraxial\napproximation. With using the dual grids, the moir\\'e effect in the plane\ngratings is simulated, as well as the near-axis moir\\'e effect in cylinders\nincluding the chiral layouts. The results can be applied to the graphene\nlayers, to single-walled nanotubes, and to cylinders in general.\n", "  We present the fully general, model independent study of a few rare\nsemileptonic $B$ decays that get dominant contributions from $W$-annihilation\nand $W$-exchange diagrams, in particular $B^0 \\to \\bar{D}^0 \\ell^+\\ell^-$,\nwhere $\\ell = e,\\mu$. We consider the most general Lagrangian for the decay,\nand define three angular asymmetries in the Gottfried-Jackson frame, which are\nsensitive to new physics. We show how these angular asymmetries can be easily\nextracted from the distribution of events in the Dalitz plot for $B \\to D\n\\ell^+ \\ell^-$ decays. Especially a non-zero forward-backward asymmetry within\nthe frame would give the very first hint of possible new physics. These\nobservations are also true for related decay modes, such as $B^+ \\to D^+ \\ell^+\n\\ell^-$ and $B^0 \\to D^0 \\ell^+ \\ell^-$. Moreover, these asymmetry signatures\nare not affected by either $B^0$-$\\bar{B}^0$ or $D^0$-$\\bar{D}^0$ mixings.\nThen, this implies that both $B^0 \\to \\bar{D}^0 \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ and $B^0 \\to D^0\n\\ell^+ \\ell^-$ as well as their CP conjugate modes can all be considered\ntogether in our search for signature of new physics. Hence, it would be of\ngreat importance to look for and study these decays in the laboratory, LHCb and\nBelle II in particular.\n", "  Recent advances in engineered gradient metasurfaces have enabled\nunprecedented opportunities for light manipulation using optically thin sheets,\nsuch as anomalous refraction, reflection, or focusing of an incident beam. Here\nwe introduce a concept of multi-channel functional metasurfaces, which are able\nto control incoming and outgoing waves in a number of propagation directions\nsimultaneously. In particular, we reveal a possibility to engineer\nmulti-channel reflectors. Under the assumption of reciprocity and energy\nconservation, we find that there exist three basic functionalities of such\nreflectors: Specular, anomalous, and retro reflections. Multi-channel response\nof a general flat reflector can be described by a combination of these\nfunctionalities. To demonstrate the potential of the introduced concept, we\ndesign and experimentally test three different multi-channel reflectors: Three-\nand five-channel retro-reflectors and a three-channel power splitter.\nFurthermore, by extending the concept to reflectors supporting higher-order\nFloquet harmonics, we forecast the emergence of other multiple-channel flat\ndevices, such as isolating mirrors, complex splitters, and multi-functional\ngratings.\n", "  We investigate back reaction in de Sitter space in an approach where only\nstates that are observationally accessible are included in the density matrix.\nUsing the Bunch-Davies vacuum as the initial condition we find for a conformal\nscalar field and a cosmological constant that tracing over the unobservable\nstates beyond the cosmological horizon leads to a thermal spectrum of particles\nand that such a configuration is unstable under semi-classical back reaction.\nIt is concluded that this prescription results in an instability of de Sitter\nspace with a gradually increasing horizon size.\n", "  We report on the galaxy MACSJ0032-arc at z=3.6314 discovered during the\nHerschel Lensing snapshot Survey of massive galaxy clusters, and strongly\nlensed by the cluster MACSJ0032.1+1808. The successful detections of its\nrest-frame UV, optical, FIR, millimeter, and radio continua, and of its CO\nemission enable us to characterize, for the first time at such a high redshift,\nthe stellar, dust, and molecular gas properties of a compact star-forming\ngalaxy with a size smaller than 2.5 kpc, a fairly low stellar mass of 4.8x10^9\nMsun, and a moderate IR luminosity of 4.8x10^11 Lsun. We find that the bulk of\nthe molecular gas mass and star formation seems to be spatially decoupled from\nthe rest-frame UV emission. About 90% of the total star formation rate is\nundetected at rest-frame UV wavelengths because of severe obscuration by dust,\nbut is seen through the thermal FIR dust emission and the radio synchrotron\nradiation. The observed CO(4-3) and CO(6-5) lines demonstrate that high-J\ntransitions, at least up to J=6, remain excited in this galaxy, whose CO\nspectral line energy distribution resembles that of high-redshift submm\ngalaxies, even though the IR luminosity of MACSJ0032-arc is ten times lower.\nThis high CO excitation is possibly due to the compactness of the galaxy. We\nfind evidence that this high CO excitation has to be considered in the balance\nwhen estimating the CO-to-H2 conversion factor. The inferred depletion time of\nthe molecular gas in MACSJ0032-arc supports the decrease in the gas depletion\ntimescale of galaxies with redshift, although to a lesser degree than predicted\nby galaxy evolution models. Instead, the measured molecular gas fraction as\nhigh as 60-79% in MACSJ0032-arc favors the continued increase in the gas\nfraction of galaxies with redshift as expected, despite the plateau observed\nbetween z~1.5 and z~2.5.\n", "  We investigate the intra-cluster light (ICL) in the 6 Hubble Frontier Field\nclusters at $0.3<z<0.6$. We employ a new method, which is free from any\nfunctional form of the ICL profile, and exploit the unprecedented depth of this\nHubble Space Telescope imaging to map the ICL's diffuse light out to\nclustrocentric radii $R\\sim300$kpc ($\\mu_{\\rm ICL}\\sim27$mag arcsec$^{-2}$).\nFrom these maps, we construct radial color and stellar mass profiles via SED\nfitting and find clear negative color gradients in all systems with increasing\ndistance from the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG). While this implies older/more\nmetal rich stellar components in the inner part of the ICL, we find the ICL\nmostly consists of a $<2$Gyr population, and plausibly originated with $\\log\nM_*/M_\\odot<10$ cluster galaxies. Further, we find 10-15% of the ICL's mass at\nlarge radii ($>150$kpc) lies in a younger/bluer stellar population\n($\\sim1$Gyr), a phenomenon not seen in local samples. We attribute this light\nto the higher fraction of starforming/(post-)starburst galaxies in clusters at\n$z\\sim0.5$. Ultimately, we find the ICL's total mass to be $\\log M_{\\rm *}^{\\rm\nICL}/M_\\odot\\sim11$-12, constituting 5%-20% of the clusters' total stellar\nmass, or about a half of the value at $z\\sim0$. The above implies distinct\nformation histories for the ICL and BCGs/other massive cluster galaxies; i.e.\nthe ICL at this epoch is still being constructed rapidly\n($\\sim40M_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$), while the BCGs have mostly completed their\nevolution. To be consistent with the ICL measurements of local massive\nclusters, such as the Virgo, our data suggest mass acquisition mainly from\nquiescent cluster galaxies is the principal source of ICL material in the\nsubsequent $\\sim$5 Gyr of cosmic time.\n", "  We investigate the role of quantum coherence depletion (QCD) in Grover search\nalgorithm (GA) by using several typical measures of quantum coherence and\nquantum correlations. By using the relative entropy of coherence measure\n($\\mathcal{C}_r$), we show that the success probability depends on the QCD. The\nsame phenomenon is also found by using the $l_1$ norm of coherence measure\n($\\mathcal{C}_{l_1}$). In the limit case, the cost performance is defined to\ncharacterize the behavior about QCD in enhancing the success probability of GA,\nwhich is only related to the number of searcher items and the scale of\ndatabase, no matter using $\\mathcal{C}_r$ or $\\mathcal{C}_{l_1}$. In\ngeneralized Grover search algorithm (GGA), the QCD for a class of states\nincreases with the required optimal measurement time. In comparison, the\nquantification of other quantum correlations in GA, such as pairwise\nentanglement, multipartite entanglement, pairwise discord and genuine\nmultipartite discord, cannot be directly related to the success probability or\nthe optimal measurement time. Additionally, we do not detect pairwise\nnonlocality or genuine tripartite nonlocality in GA since\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality and Svetlichny's inequality are not\nviolated.\n", "  Primordial gravitational waves leave a characteristic imprint on the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) in the form of $B$-mode polarization. Photons are\nalso deflected by large scale gravitational waves which intervene between the\nsource screen and our telescopes, resulting in curl-type gravitational lensing.\nGravitational waves present at the epoch of reionization contribute to both\neffects, thereby leading to a non-vanishing cross-correlation between $B$-mode\npolarization and curl lensing of the CMB. Observing such a cross correlation\nwould be very strong evidence that an observation of $B$-mode polarization was\ndue to the presence of large scale gravitational waves, as opposed to\nastrophysical foregrounds or experimental systematic effects. We study the\ncross-correlation across a wide range of source redshifts and show that a\npost-SKA experiment aimed to map out the 21-cm sky between $15 \\leq z \\leq 30$\ncould rule out non-zero cross-correlation at high significance for $r \\geq\n0.01$.\n", "  In the present work, which aims at searching for bound sates, the\ninteractions of the $D$-multi-$\\rho$ systems are investigated by means of the\nformalism of the fixed-center-approximation to Faddeev equations. Reproducing\nthe states of $f_2 (1270)$ and $D_1 (2420)$ dynamically in the two-body\n$\\rho\\rho$ and $\\rho D$ interactions, respectively, as the clusters of the\nfixed center approximation, the state of $D(3000)^0$ is found as a molecule of\n$D-f_2$ or $\\rho-D_1$ structures in the three-body interactions, where we\ndetermine its quantum number $J^P = 2^-$ and find another possible state of\n$D_2 (3100)$ with isospin $I=3/2$. In our results, there are some other\npredictions with uncertainties, a $D_3 (3160)$ state with $I(J^P) = \\frac{1}{2}\n(3^+)$ in the four-body interactions, a narrow $D_4 (3730)$ state with $I(J^P)\n= \\frac{1}{2} (4^-)$, a wide $D_4 (3410)$ state of $I(J^P) = \\frac{1}{2}\n(4^-)$, and another wide $D_4 (3770)$ state but with $I(J^P) = \\frac{3}{2}\n(4^-)$ in the five-body interactions, and a $D_5 (3570)$ state with $I(J^P) =\n\\frac{1}{2} (5^+)$ in the six-body interactions. Our results are consistent\nwith the findings of quark models.\n", "  Near-infrared surveys have now determined the luminosity functions of\ngalaxies at 6<z<9 to impressive precision and identified a number of candidates\nat even earlier times. Here we develop a simple analytic model to describe\nthese populations that allows physically-motivated extrapolation to earlier\ntimes and fainter luminosities. We assume that galaxies grow through accretion\nonto dark matter halos, which we model by matching halos at fixed number\ndensity across redshift, and that stellar feedback limits the star formation\nrate. We allow for a variety of feedback mechanisms, including regulation\nthrough supernova energy and momentum from radiation pressure. We show that\nreasonable choices for the feedback parameters can fit the available galaxy\ndata, which in turn substantially limits the range of plausible extrapolations\nof the luminosity function to earlier times and fainter luminosities: for\nexample, the global star formation rate declines rapidly at z>10, but the\nbright galaxies accessible to observations decline much faster than the total.\nDeviations from our predictions would provide evidence for new astrophysics\nwithin the first generations of galaxies. We also provide predictions for\ngalaxy measurements by future facilities, including JWST and WFIRST.\n", "  We examine the cosmological information available from the 1-point\nprobability distribution (PDF) of the weak-lensing convergence field, utilizing\nfast L-PICOLA simulations and a Fisher analysis. We find competitive\nconstraints in the $\\Omega_m$-$\\sigma_8$ plane from the convergence PDF with\n$188\\ arcmin^2$ pixels compared to the cosmic shear power spectrum with an\nequivalent number of modes ($\\ell < 886$). The convergence PDF also partially\nbreaks the degeneracy cosmic shear exhibits in that parameter space. A joint\nanalysis of the convergence PDF and shear 2-point function also reduces the\nimpact of shape measurement systematics, to which the PDF is less susceptible,\nand improves the total figure of merit by a factor of $2-3$, depending on the\nlevel of systematics. Finally, we present a correction factor necessary for\ncalculating the unbiased Fisher information from finite differences using a\nlimited number of cosmological simulations.\n", "  We consider conformal field theories around points of large twist degeneracy.\nExamples of this are theories with weakly broken higher spin symmetry and\nperturbations around generalised free fields. At the degenerate point we\nintroduce twist conformal blocks. These are eigenfunctions of certain quartic\noperators and encode the contribution, to a given four-point correlator, of the\nwhole tower of intermediate operators with a given twist. As we perturb around\nthe degenerate point, the twist degeneracy is lifted. In many situations this\nbreaking is controlled by inverse powers of the spin. In such cases the twist\nconformal blocks can be decomposed into a sequence of functions which we\nsystematically construct. Decomposing the four-point correlator in this basis\nturns crossing symmetry into an algebraic problem. Our method can be applied to\na wide spectrum of conformal field theories in any number of dimensions and at\nany order in the breaking parameter. As an example, we compute the spectrum of\nvarious theories around generalised free fields. For theories with higher spin\nsymmetry we discuss the relation between twist conformal blocks and higher spin\nconformal blocks.\n", "  Disordered hyperuniformity is a state of matter which has isotropic liquid\nlike properties while simultaneously having crystalline like properties such as\nlittle variation in the density fluctuations over long distances. Such states\narise for the packing of photoreceptor cells in chicken eyes, jammed particle\nassemblies, and in nonequilibrium systems. An open question is what possible\napplications could utilize properties of hyperuniformity. One of the major\nissues for applications of type-II superconductors is how to achieve high\ncritical currents by preventing the motion or depinning of vortices, so there\nis great interest in understanding which pinning site geometries will lead to\nthe optimal pinning of vortices. Here, using large scale computational\nsimulations, we show that vortices in a type-II superconductor with a\nhyperuniform pinning arrangement exhibit enhanced pinning compared to an equal\nnumber of pinning sites with a purely random arrangement, and that the\nenhancement is robust over a wide range of parameters. The stronger pinning\narises in the hyperuniform arrays due to the suppression of pinning density\nfluctuations, permitting higher pin occupancy and the reduction of weak links\nthat lead to easy flow channeling. We also show that in general, in amorphous\nvortex states in the presence of either random or hyperuniform pinning arrays,\nthe vortices themselves exhibit disordered hyperuniformity due to the repulsive\nnature of the vortex-vortex interactions.\n", "  We prove an explicit formula conjectured recently by Wang and Levin for the\nanomaly of time-reversal symmetry in 2+1 dimensional fermionic topological\nquantum field theories. The crucial step is to determine the crosscap state in\nterms of the modular S matrix and $\\mathsf{T}^2$ eigenvalues, generalizing the\nrecent analysis by Barkeshli et al. in the bosonic case.\n", "  We study the interactions among phonons and the phonon lifetime in a\npair-condensed Fermi gas in the BEC-BCS crossover in the collisionless regime.\nTo compute the phonon-phonon coupling amplitudes we use a microscopic model\nbased on a generalized BCS Ansatz including moving pairs, which allows for a\nsystematic expansion around the mean field BCS approximation of the ground\nstate. We show that the quantum hydrodynamic expression of the amplitudes\nobtained by Landau and Khalatnikov apply only on the energy shell, that is for\nresonant processes that conserve energy. The microscopic model yields the same\nexcitation spectrum as the Random Phase Approximation, with a linear (phononic)\nstart and a concavity at low wave number that changes from upwards to downwards\nin the BEC-BCS crossover. When the concavity of the dispersion relation is\nupwards at low wave number, the leading damping mechanism at low temperature is\nthe Beliaev-Landau process 2 phonons $\\leftrightarrow$ 1 phonon while, when the\nconcavity is downwards, it is the Landau-Khalatnikov process 2 phonons\n$\\leftrightarrow$ 2 phonons. In both cases, by rescaling the wave vectors to\nabsorb the dependence on the interaction strength, we obtain a universal\nformula for the damping rate. This universal formula corrects and extends the\noriginal analytic results of Landau and Khalatnikov [ZhETF {\\bf 19}, 637\n(1949)] for the $2\\leftrightarrow2$ processes in the downward concavity case.\nIn the upward concavity case, for the Beliaev 1$\\leftrightarrow$ 2 process for\nthe unitary gas at zero temperature, we calculate the damping rate of an\nexcitation with wave number $q$ including the first correction proportional to\n$q^7$ to the $q^5$ hydrodynamic prediction, which was never done before in a\nsystematic way.\n", "  The rotation curves of spiral galaxies exhibit a diversity that has been\ndifficult to understand in the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. We show that\nthe self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model provides excellent fits to the\nrotation curves of a sample of galaxies with asymptotic velocities in the 25 to\n300 km/s range that exemplify the full range of diversity. We only assume the\nhalo concentration-mass relation predicted by the CDM model and a fixed value\nof the self-interaction cross section.In dark matter dominated galaxies,\nthermalization due to self-interactions creates large cores and reduces dark\nmatter densities. In contrast, thermalization leads to denser and smaller cores\nin more luminous galaxies, and naturally explains the flat rotation curves of\nthe highly luminous galaxies. Our results demonstrate that the impact of the\nbaryons on the SIDM halo profile and the scatter from the assembly history of\nhalos as encoded in the concentration-mass relation can explain the diverse\nrotation curves of spiral galaxies.\n", "  We report the first direct measurement of decays of the $\\Lambda^+_c$ baryon\ninvolving the neutron. The analysis is performed using 567 pb$^{-1}$ of\n$e^+e^-$ collision data collected at $\\sqrt{s}=4.599$ GeV with the BESIII\ndetector at the BEPCII collider. We observe the decay $\\Lambda^+_{c}\\rightarrow\nn K^0_S\\pi^+$ and measure the absolute branching fraction to be\n$\\mathcal{B}({\\Lambda^+_{c}\\rightarrow n K^0_S\\pi^+})=(1.82\\pm0.23({\\rm\nstat})\\pm0.11({\\rm syst}))\\%$. A comparison to\n$\\mathcal{B}({\\Lambda^+_{c}\\rightarrow p(\\bar{K}\\pi)^0})$ provides an important\ntest of isospin symmetry and final state interactions.\n", "  Numerical simulations of structure formation have recorded a remarkable\nprogress in the recent years, in particular due to the inclusion of baryonic\nphysics evolving with the dark matter component. We generate Monte Carlo\nrealizations of the dark matter sub-halo population based on the results of the\nrecent hydrodynamical simulation suite of Milky Way-sized galaxies. We then\nsimulate the gamma-ray sky for both the setup of the 3FGL and 2FHL Fermi Large\nArea Telescope (LAT) catalogs, including the contribution from the annihilation\nof dark matter in the sub-halos. We find that the flux sensitivity threshold\nstrongly depends on the particle dark matter mass, and more mildly also on its\nannihilation channel and the observation latitude. The results differ for the\n3FGL and 2FHL catalogs, given their different energy thresholds. We also\npredict that the number of dark matter sub-halos among the unassociated sources\nis very small. A null number of detectable sub-halos in the Fermi-LAT 3FGL\ncatalog would imply upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section\ninto $b\\bar{b}$ of $2 \\cdot 10^{-26}$ ($5 \\cdot 10^{-25}$) cm$^3$/s with\n$M_{\\rm DM}$= 50 (1000) GeV. We find less than one extended sub-halo in the\nFermi-LAT 3FGL catalog. As a matter of fact, the differences in the spatial and\nmass distribution of sub-halos between hydrodynamic and dark matter-only runs\ndo not have significant impact on the gamma-ray dark matter phenomenology.\n", "  A gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet running into an external medium is expected to\ngenerate luminous GeV-TeV emission lasting from minutes to several hours. The\nhigh-energy emission results from inverse Compton upscattering of prompt and\nafterglow photons by shock-heated {\\it thermal} plasma. At its peak the\nhigh-energy radiation carries a significant fraction of the power dissipated at\nthe forward shock. We discuss in detail the expected TeV luminosity, using a\nrobust \"minimal\" emission model. Then, using the statistical properties of the\nGRB population (luminosity function, redshift distribution, afterglow energy)\nwe simulate the expected detection rates of GRBs by current and upcoming\natmospheric Cherenkov instruments. We find that GRBs exploding into a\nlow-density interstellar medium must produce TeV emission that would have\nalready been detected by the currently operating Cherenkov telescopes. The\nabsence of detections is consistent with explosions into a dense wind of the\nGRB progenitor. If the typical environment of long GRBs is a Wolf-Rayet\nprogenitor wind, as suggested by the recent analysis of Fermi LAT data, then\nthe upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) should be able to detect a\nfraction of GRBs that trigger the space-borne detectors. Since absorption by\nthe extragalactic background light limits the detectability above 0.1 TeV for\nall but the most nearby bursts ($z\\lesssim 1$), the reduced energy threshold of\nCTA is the key improvement over current instruments, which should boost the\ndetection rate by at least a factor of 3.\n", "  I have proposed that long Halpha fibrils are caused by heating events of\nwhich the tracks are afterwards outlined by contrails of cooling gas with\nextraordinary Halpha opacity and yet larger opacity at the ALMA wavelengths.\nHere I detail the radiative transfer background.\n", "  We study the galaxy clustering dependence on the\n$\\left[\\mathrm{O\\scriptsize{II}}\\right]$ emission line luminosity in the SDSS\nDR7 Main galaxy sample at mean redshift $z\\sim0.1$. We select volume-limited\nsamples of galaxies with different $\\left[\\mathrm{O\\scriptsize{II}}\\right]$\nluminosity thresholds and measure their projected, monopole and quadrupole\ntwo-point correlation functions. We model these observations using the\n1$h^{-1}\\rm{Gpc}$ MultiDark Planck cosmological simulation and generate\nlight-cones with the SUrvey GenerAtoR algorithm. To interpret our results, we\nadopt a modified (Sub)Halo Abundance Matching scheme, accounting for the\nstellar mass incompleteness of the emission line galaxies. The satellite\nfraction constitutes an extra parameter in this model and allows to optimize\nthe clustering fit on both small and intermediate scales (i.e. $r_p\\lesssim\n30h^{-1}\\rm{Mpc})$, with no need of any velocity bias correction. We find that,\nin the local Universe, the $\\left[\\mathrm{O\\scriptsize{II}}\\right]$ luminosity\ncorrelates with all the clustering statistics explored and with the galaxy\nbias. This latter quantity correlates more strongly with the SDSS $r$-band\nmagnitude than $\\left[\\mathrm{O\\scriptsize{II}}\\right]$ luminosity. In\nconclusion, we propose a straightforward method to produce reliable clustering\nmodels, entirely built on the simulation products, which provides robust\npredictions of the typical ELG host halo masses and satellite fraction values.\nThe SDSS galaxy data, MultiDark mock catalogues and clustering results are made\npublicly available.\n", "  We present here a new stochastic modelling in the constitution of fluid flow\nreduced-order models. This framework introduces a spatially inhomogeneous\nrandom field to represent the unresolved small-scale velocity component. Such a\ndecomposition of the velocity in terms of a smooth large-scale velocity\ncomponent and a rough, highly oscillating, component gives rise, without any\nsupplementary assumption, to a large-scale flow dynamics that includes a\nmodified advection term together with an inhomogeneous diffusion term. Both of\nthose terms, related respectively to turbophoresis and mixing effects, depend\non the variance of the unre-solved small-scale velocity component. They bring\nto the reduced system an explicit subgrid term enabling to take into account\nthe action of the truncated modes. Besides, a decomposition of the variance\ntensor in terms of diffusion modes provides a meaningful statistical\nrepresentation of the stationary or nonstationary structuration of the\nsmall-scale velocity and of its action on the resolved modes. This supplies a\nuseful tool for turbulent fluid flows data analysis. We apply this methodology\nto circular cylinder wake flow at Reynolds numbers Re = 300 and Re = 3900,\nrespectively. The finite dimensional models of the wake flows reveal the energy\nand the anisotropy distributions of the small-scale diffusion modes. These\ndistributions identify critical regions where corrective advection effects as\nwell as structured energy dissipation effects take place. In providing\nrigorously derived subgrid terms, the proposed approach yields accurate and\nrobust temporal reconstruction of the low-dimensional models.\n", "  We present six galaxies at z~2 that show evidence of Lyman continuum (LyC)\nemission based on the newly acquired UV imaging of the Hubble Deep UV legacy\nsurvey (HDUV) conducted with the WFC3/UVIS camera on the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST). At the redshift of these sources, the HDUV F275W images partially probe\nthe ionizing continuum. By exploiting the HST multi-wavelength data available\nin the HDUV/GOODS fields, models of the UV spectral energy distributions, and\ndetailed Monte Carlo simulations of the intergalactic medium absorption, we\nestimate the absolute ionizing photon escape fractions of these galaxies to be\nvery high -- typically >60% (>13% for all sources at 90% likelihood). Our\nfindings are in broad agreement with previous studies that found only a small\nfraction of galaxies to show high escape fraction. These six galaxies comprise\nthe largest sample yet of LyC leaking candidates at z~2 whose inferred LyC flux\nhas been cleanly observed at HST resolution. While three of our six candidates\nshow evidence of hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN), two of these are\nheavily obscured and their LyC emission appears to originate from star-forming\nregions rather than the central nucleus. This suggests an AGN-aided pathway for\nLyC escape from these sources. Extensive multi-wavelength data in the GOODS\nfields, especially the near-IR grism spectra from the 3D-HST survey, enable us\nto study the candidates in detail and tentatively test some recently proposed\nindirect methods to probe LyC leakage -- namely, the [OIII]/[OII] line ratio\nand the H$\\beta-$UV slope diagram. High-resolution spectroscopic followup of\nour candidates will help constrain such indirect methods which are our only\nhope of studying $f_{esc}$ at z~5-9 in the fast-approaching era of the James\nWebb Space Telescope.\n", "  We introduce a general class of toy models to study the quantum\ninformation-theoretic properties of black hole radiation. The models are\ngoverned by a set of isometries that specify how microstates of the black hole\nat a given energy evolve to entangled states of a tensor product\nblack-hole/radiation Hilbert space. The final state of the black hole radiation\nis conveniently summarized by a tensor network built from these isometries. We\nintroduce a set of quantities generalizing the Renyi entropies that provide a\ncomplete set of bipartite/multipartite entanglement measures, and give a\ngeneral formula for the average of these over initial black hole states in\nterms of the isometries defining the model. For models where the dimension of\nthe final tensor product radiation Hilbert space is the same as that of the\nspace of initial black hole microstates, the entanglement structure is\nuniversal, independent of the choice of isometries. In the more general case,\nwe find that models which best capture the \"information-free\" property of black\nhole horizons are those whose isometries are tensors corresponding to states of\ntripartite systems with maximally mixed subsystems.\n", "  Half-metallic ferromagnetism (HMFM) occurs rarely in materials and yet offers\ngreat potential for spintronic devices. Recent experiments suggest a class of\ncompounds with the `ThCr$_{2}$Si$_{2}$' (122) structure -- isostructural and\ncontaining elements common with Fe pnictide-based superconductors -- can\nexhibit HMFM. Here we use $ab$ $initio$ density-functional theory calculations\nto understand the onset of half-metallicity in this family of materials and\nexplain the appearance of ferromagnetism at a quantum critical point. We also\npredict new candidate materials with HMFM and high Curie temperatures through\nA-site alloying.\n", "  Spontaneous collapse models predict that a weak force noise acts on any\nmechanical system, as a consequence of the collapse of the wave function.\nSignificant upper limits on the collapse rate have been recently inferred from\nprecision mechanical experiments, such as ultracold cantilevers and the space\nmission LISA Pathfinder. Here, we report new results from an experiment based\non a high-Q cantilever cooled to millikelvin temperatures, which is potentially\nable to improve the current bounds on the continuous spontaneous localization\n(CSL) model by 1 order of magnitude. High accuracy measurements of the\ncantilever thermal fluctuations reveal a nonthermal force noise of unknown\norigin. This excess noise is compatible with the CSL heating predicted by\nAdler. Several physical mechanisms able to explain the observed noise have been\nruled out.ler. Several physical mechanisms able to explain the observed noise\nhave been ruled out.\n", "  We present the results of a search for additional bodies in the GJ 1132\nsystem through two methods: photometric transits and transit timing variations\nof the known planet. We collected 21 transit observations of GJ 1132b with the\nMEarth-South array since 2015. We obtained 100 near-continuous hours of\nobservations with the $Spitzer$ Space Telescope, including two transits of GJ\n1132b and spanning 60\\% of the orbital phase of the maximum period at which\nbodies coplanar with GJ 1132b would pass in front of the star. We exclude\ntransits of additional Mars-sized bodies, such as a second planet or a moon,\nwith a confidence of 99.7\\%. When we combine the mass estimate of the star\n(obtained from its parallax and apparent $K_s$ band magnitude) with the stellar\ndensity inferred from our high-cadence $Spitzer$ light curve (assuming zero\neccentricity), we measure the stellar radius of GJ 1132 to be\n$0.2105^{+0.0102}_{-0.0085} R_\\odot$, and we refine the radius measurement of\nGJ 1132b to $1.130 \\pm 0.056 R_\\oplus$. Combined with HARPS RV measurements, we\ndetermine the density of GJ 1132b to be $6.2 \\pm 2.0$\\ g cm$^{-3}$, with the\nmass determination dominating this uncertainty. We refine the ephemeris of the\nsystem and find no evidence for transit timing variations, which would be\nexpected if there was a second planet near an orbital resonance with GJ 1132b.\n", "  We study three-dimensional supersymmetric quiver gauge theories with a\nnon-simply laced global symmetry primarily focusing on framed affine $B_{N}$\nquiver theories. Using a supersymmetric partition function on a three sphere,\nand its transformation under S-duality, we study the three-dimensional ADHM\nquiver for $SO(2N+1)$ instantons with a half-integer Chern-Simons coupling. The\ntheory after S-duality has no Lagrangian, and can not be represented by a\nsingle quiver, however its partition function can be conveniently described by\na collection of framed affine ${B}_{N}$ quivers. This correspondence can be\nconjectured to generalize three-dimensional mirror symmetry to theories with\nnontrivial Chern-Simons terms. In addition, we propose a formula for the\nsuperconformal index of a theory described by a framed affine $B_N$ quiver.\n", "  The problem of linearization for third order evolution equations is\nconsidered. Criteria for testing equations for linearity are presented. A class\nof linearizable equations depending on arbitrary functions is obtained by\nrequiring presence of an infinite-dimensional symmetry group. Linearizing\ntransformations for this class are found using symmetry structure and local\nconservation laws. A number of special cases as examples are discussed. Their\ntransformation to equations within the same class by differential substitutions\nand connection with KdV and mKdV equations are also reviewed in this framework.\n", "  In the setting of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetimes, we consider\nKlein-Gordon fields subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, with mass\nsatisfying the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. We introduce a condition on the\nb-wave front set of two-point functions of quantum fields, which locally in the\nbulk amounts to the usual Hadamard condition, and which moreover allows to\nestimate wave front sets for the holographically induced theory on the\nboundary. We prove the existence of two-point functions satisfying this\ncondition, and show their uniqueness modulo terms that have smooth Schwartz\nkernel in the bulk and have smooth restriction to the boundary. Finally, using\nVasy's propagation of singularities theorem, we prove an analogue of\nDuistermaat and H\\\"ormander's theorem on distinguished parametrices.\n", "  We study dynamics of (anomalous) Galilean superfluid up to first order in\nderivative expansion, both in parity-even and parity-odd sectors. We construct\na relativistic system -- null superfluid, which is a null fluid (introduced in\n[arXiv:1509.04718]) with a spontaneously broken global $U(1)$ symmetry. A null\nsuperfluid is in one to one correspondence with Galilean superfluid in one\nlower dimension, i.e. they have same symmetries, thermodynamics, constitutive\nrelations and are related to each other by a mere choice of basis. The\ncorrespondence is based on null reduction, which is known to reduce the\nPoincar\\'{e} symmetry of a theory to Galilean symmetry in one lower dimension.\nTo perform this analysis, we use offshell formalism of (super)fluid dynamics,\nadopting it appropriately to null (super)fluids.\n", "  We study the statics and dynamics of a stable, mobile, three-dimensional\nmatter-wave spherical quantum ball created in the presence of an attractive\ntwo-body and a very small repulsive three-body interaction. The quantum ball\ncan propagate with a constant velocity in any direction in free space and its\nstability under a small perturbation is established numerically and\nvariationally. In frontal head-on and angular collisions at large velocities\ntwo quantum balls behave like quantum solitons. Such collision is found to be\nquasi elastic and the quantum balls emerge after collision without any change\nof direction of motion and velocity and with practically no deformation in\nshape. When reflected by a hard impenetrable plane, the quantum ball bounces\noff like a wave obeying the law of reflection without any change of shape or\nspeed. However, in a collision at small velocities two quantum balls coalesce\nto form a larger ball which we call a quantum-ball breather. We point out the\nsimilarity and difference between the collision of two quantum and classical\nballs. The present study is based on an analytic variational approximation and\na full numerical solution of the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation using the\nparameters of $^7$Li atoms.\n", "  We introduce TIGRESS, a novel framework for multi-physics numerical\nsimulations of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM) implemented in the\nAthena MHD code. The algorithms of TIGRESS are designed to spatially and\ntemporally resolve key physical features, including: (1) the gravitational\ncollapse and ongoing accretion of gas that leads to star formation in clusters,\n(2) the explosions of supernovae (SNe) both near their progenitor birth sites\nand from runaway OB stars, with time delays relative to star formation\ndetermined by population synthesis, (3) explicit evolution of SN remnants prior\nto the onset of cooling, which leads to the creation of the hot ISM, (4)\nphotoelectric heating of the warm and cold phases of the ISM that tracks the\ntime-dependent ambient FUV field from the young cluster population, (5)\nlarge-scale galactic differential rotation, which leads to epicyclic motion and\nshears out overdense structures, limiting large-scale gravitational collapse,\n(6) accurate evolution of magnetic fields, which can be important for vertical\nsupport of the ISM disk as well as angular momentum transport. We present tests\nof the newly-implemented physics modules, and demonstrate application of\nTIGRESS in a fiducial model representing the Solar neighborhood environment. We\nuse a resolution study to demonstrate convergence and evaluate the minimum\nresolution dx required to correctly recover several ISM properties, including\nthe star formation rate, wind mass-loss rate, disk scale height, turbulent and\nAlfvenic velocity dispersions, and volume fractions of warm and hot phases. For\nthe Solar neighborhood model, all these ISM properties are converged at dx <=\n8pc.\n", "  We propose in this work a fractional stochastic differential equation (FSDE)\nmodel consistent with the over-damped limit of the generalized Langevin\nequation model. As a result of the `fluctuation-dissipation theorem', the\ndifferential equations driven by fractional Brownian noise to model memory\neffects should be paired with Caputo derivatives, and this FSDE model should be\nunderstood in an integral form. We establish the existence of strong solutions\nfor such equations and discuss the ergodicity and convergence to Gibbs measure.\nIn the linear forcing regime, we show rigorously the algebraic convergence to\nGibbs measure when the `fluctuation-dissipation theorem' is satisfied, and this\nverifies that satisfying `fluctuation-dissipation theorem' indeed leads to the\ncorrect physical behavior. We further discuss possible approaches to analyze\nthe ergodicity and convergence to Gibbs measure in the nonlinear forcing\nregime, while leave the rigorous analysis for future works. The FSDE model\nproposed is suitable for systems in contact with heat bath with power-law\nkernel and subdiffusion behaviors.\n", "  I review the evolution of low-mass stars with outer convective zones over\ntimescales of millions-to-billions of years, from the pre-main sequence to\nsolar-age, ~4.6 Gyr (Bahcall et al. 1995; Amelin et al. 2010), and beyond. I\ndiscuss the evolution of high-energy coronal and chromospheric emission, the\nlinks with stellar rotation and magnetism, and the emergence of the\nrotation-activity relation for stars within young clusters.\n", "  Nanoporous materials are a promising platform for thermoelectrics in that\nthey offer high thermal conductivity tunability while preserving good\nelectrical properties, a crucial requirement for high- effciency thermal energy\nconversion. Understanding the impact of the pore arrangement on thermal\ntransport is pivotal to engineering realistic materials, where pore disorder is\nunavoidable. Although there has been considerable progress in modeling thermal\nsize effects in nanostructures, it has remained a challenge to screen such\nmaterials over a large phase space due to the slow simulation time required for\naccurate results. We use density functional theory in connection with the\nBoltzmann transport equation, to perform calculations of thermal conductivity\nin disordered porous materials. By leveraging graph theory and regressive\nanalysis, we identify the set of pores representing the phonon bottleneck and\nobtain a descriptor for thermal transport, based on the sum of the pore-pore\ndistances between such pores. This approach provides a simple tool to estimate\nphonon suppression in realistic porous materials for thermoelectric\napplications and enhance our understanding of heat transport in disordered\nmaterials.\n", "  We define a simple model of conformal field theory in random space-time\nenvironments, which we refer to as stochastic conformal field theory. This\nmodel accounts for the effects of dilute random impurities in strongly\ninteracting critical many-body systems. On one hand, surprisingly, although\nimpurities are separated by macroscopic distances, we find that the\ninfinite-time steady state is factorized on microscopic lengths, a signature of\nthe emergence of localization. The stationary state also displays vanishing\nenergy current and strong uncorrelated spatial fluctuations of local\nobservables. On the other hand, at finite times, the transient shows a\ncrossover from ballistic to diffusive energy propagation. In this regime and a\nMarkovian limit, concentrating on current-generating initial states with a\ntemperature imbalance, we show that the energy current and density satisfy\nsimple dissipative hydrodynamic equations. We describe the space-time scales at\nwhich non-equilibrium currents exist. We show that a light-cone effect subsists\nin the presence of impurities although a momentum burst propagates transiently\non a diffusive scale only.\n", "  We report high pressure Raman experiments of Black phosphorus up to 24 GPa.\nThe line widths of first order Raman modes A$^1_g$, B$_{2g}$ and A$^2_g$ of the\northorhombic phase show a minimum at 1.1 GPa. Our first-principles density\nfunctional analysis reveals that this is associated with the anomalies in\nelectron-phonon coupling at the semiconductor to topological insulator\ntransition through inversion of valence and conduction bands marking a change\nfrom trivial to nontrivial electronic topology. The frequencies of B$_{2g}$ and\nA$^2_g$ modes become anomalous in the rhombohedral phase at 7.4 GPa, and new\nmodes appearing in the rhombohedral phase show anomalous softening with\npressure. This is shown to originate from unusual structural evolution of black\nphosphorous with pressure, based on first-principles theoretical analysis.\n", "  We elucidate the relation between Painlev\\'e equations and four-dimensional\nrank one ${\\cal N= 2}$ theories by identifying the connection associated to\nPainlev\\'e isomonodromic problems with the oper limit of the flat connection of\nthe Hitchin system associated to gauge theories and by studying the\ncorresponding renormalisation group flow. Based on this correspondence we\nprovide long-distance expansions at various canonical rays for all Painlev\\'e\nfunctions in terms of magnetic and dyonic Nekrasov partition functions for\n${\\cal N= 2}$ SQCD and Argyres-Douglas theories at self-dual Omega background\n$\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2= 0$, or equivalently in terms of $c= 1$ irregular\nconformal blocks.\n", "  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are explosive events that occur basically daily\non the Sun. It is thought that these events play a crucial role in the angular\nmomentum and mass loss of late-type stars, and also shape the environment in\nwhich planets form and live. Stellar CMEs can be detected in optical spectra in\nthe Balmer lines, especially in Halpha, as blue-shifted extra\nemission/absorption. To increase the detection probability one can monitor\nyoung open clusters, in which the stars are due to their youth still rapid\nrotators, and thus magnetically active and likely to exhibit a large number of\nCMEs. Using ESO facilities and the Nordic Optical Telescope we have obtained\ntime series of multi-object spectroscopic observations of late-type stars in\nsix open clusters with ages ranging from 15 Myrs to 300 Myrs. Additionally, we\nhave studied archival data of numerous active stars. These observations will\nallow us to obtain information on the occurrence rate of CMEs in late-type\nstars with different ages and spectral types. Here we report on the preliminary\noutcome of our studies.\n", "  We analyze the prospects of observing the light CP-even neutral Higgs bosons\n($h_1$) in their decays into $b \\bar b$ quarks, in the neutral and charged\ncurrent production processes $e h_1 q$ and $\\nu h_1 q$ at the upcoming LHeC,\nwith $\\sqrt s \\approx 1.296$ TeV. Assuming that the intermediate Higgs boson\n($h_2$) is Standard Model (SM)-like, we study the Higgs production within the\nframework of NMSSM. We consider the constraints from Dark-matter, Sparticle\nmasses, and the Higgs boson data. The signal in our analysis can be classified\nas three jets, with electron (missing energy)coming from the neutral (charged)\ncurrent interaction. We demand that the number of b-tagged jets in the central\nrapidity region be greater or equal to two. The remaining jet is tagged in the\nforward regions. With this forward jet and two $b$-tagged jets in the central\nregion, we reconstructed three jets invariant masses. Applying some lower\nlimits on these invariant masses turns out to be an essential criterion to\nenhance the signal--to--background rates, with slightly different sets of\nkinematical selections in the two different channels. We consider almost all\nreducible and irreducible SM background processes. We find that the non-SM like\nHiggs boson, $h_1$, would be accessible in some of the NMSSM benchmark points,\nat approximately 0.4$\\sigma$ (2.5$\\sigma$) level in the $e$+3j channel up to\nHiggs boson masses of 75 GeV and in the $E\\!\\!\\!\\!/_T$+3j channel could be\ndiscovered with 1.7$\\sigma$ (2.4$\\sigma$) level up to Higgs boson masses of 88\nGeV with 100 fb$^{-1}$ of data in a simple cut-based (with optimization)\nselection. With ten times more data accumulation at the end of the LHeC run and\nusing optimization, one can have 5$\\sigma$ discovery in the electron (missing\nenergy) channel up to 85 (more than 90) GeV.\n", "  We introduce an extension of the Standard Model and General Relativity built\nupon the principle of local conformal invariance, which represents a\ngeneralization of a previous work by Bars, Steinhardt and Turok. This is\nnaturally realized by adopting as a geometric framework a particular class of\nnon-Riemannian geometries, first studied by Weyl. The gravitational sector is\nenriched by a scalar and a vector field. The latter has a geometric origin and\nrepresents the novel feature of our approach. We argue that physical scales\ncould emerge from a theory with no dimensionful parameters, as a result of the\nspontaneous breakdown of conformal and electroweak symmetries. We study the\ndynamics of matter fields in this modified gravity theory and show that test\nparticles follow geodesics of the Levi-Civita connection, thus resolving an old\ncriticism raised by Einstein against Weyl's original proposal.\n", "  Devices that achieve nonreciprocal microwave transmission are ubiquitous in\nradar and radio-frequency communication systems, and commonly rely on\nmagnetically biased ferrite materials. Such devices are also indispensable in\nthe readout chains of superconducting quantum circuits as they protect\nsensitive quantum systems from the noise emitted by readout electronics. Since\nferrite-based nonreciprocal devices are bulky, lossy, and require large\nmagnetic fields, there has been significant interest in magnetic-field-free\non-chip alternatives, such as those recently implemented using Josephson\njunctions. Here we realise reconfigurable nonreciprocal transmission between\ntwo microwave modes using purely optomechanical interactions in a\nsuperconducting electromechanical circuit. We analyse the transmission as well\nas the noise properties of this nonreciprocal circuit. The scheme relies on the\ninterference in two mechanical modes that mediate coupling between microwave\ncavities. Finally, we show how quantum-limited circulators can be realized with\nthe same principle. The technology can be built on-chip without any external\nmagnetic field, and is hence fully compatible with superconducting quantum\ncircuits. All-optomechanically-mediated nonreciprocity demonstrated here can\nalso be extended to implement directional amplifiers, and it forms the basis\ntowards realising topological states of light and sound.\n", "  In two space dimensions and one time dimension a wave changes its shape even\nin the absence of a dispersive medium. However, this anomalous dispersive\nbehavior in empty two-dimensional space does not occur if the wave dynamics is\ndescribed by a linear homogeneous wave equation in two space dimensions and\n{\\it two} time dimensions. Wave propagation in such a space can be realized in\na three-dimensional anisotropic metamaterial in which one of the space\ndimensions has a negative permittivity and thus serves as an effective second\ntime dimension. These results lead to a fundamental understanding and new\napproaches to ultrashort pulse shaping in nanostructures and metamaterials.\n", "  Cell migration in morphogenesis and cancer metastasis typically involves\ninterplay between different cell types. We construct and study a minimal,\none-dimensional model comprised of two different motile cells with each cell\nrepresented as an active elastic dimer. The interaction between the two cells\nvia cadherins is modeled as a spring that can rupture beyond a threshold force\nas it undergoes dynamic loading via the attached motile cells. We obtain a\nphase diagram consisting of chase-and-run dynamics and clumping dynamics as a\nfunction of the stiffness of the interaction spring and the threshold force. We\nalso find that while feedback between cadherins and cell-substrate interaction\nvia integrins accentuates the chase-run behavior, feedback is not necessary for\nit.\n", "  Carter and Lichnerowicz have established that barotropic fluid flows are\nconformally geodesic and obey Hamilton's principle. This variational approach\ncan accommodate neutral, or charged and poorly conducting, fluids. We show\nthat, unlike what has been previously thought, this approach can also\naccommodate perfectly conducting magnetofluids, via the Bekenstein-Oron\ndescription of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. When Noether symmetries associated\nwith Killing vectors or tensors are present in geodesic flows, they lead to\nconstants of motion polynomial in the momenta. We generalize these concepts to\nhydrodynamic flows. Moreover, the Hamiltonian descriptions of ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics allow one to cast the evolution equations into a\nhyperbolic form useful for evolving rotating or binary compact objects with\nmagnetic fields in numerical general relativity. Conserved circulation laws,\nsuch as those of Kelvin, Alfv\\'en and Bekenstein-Oron, emerge simply as special\ncases of the Poincar\\'e-Cartan integral invariant of Hamiltonian systems. We\nuse this approach to obtain an extension of Kelvin's theorem to baroclinic\n(non-isentropic) fluids, based on a temperature-dependent time parameter. We\nfurther extend this result to perfectly or poorly conducting baroclinic\nmagnetoflows. Finally, in the barotropic case, such magnetoflows are shown to\nalso be geodesic, albeit in a Finsler (rather than Riemann) space.\n", "  Future high-sensitivity measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nanisotropies and energy spectrum will be limited by our understanding and\nmodeling of foregrounds. Not only does more information need to be gathered and\ncombined, but also novel approaches for the modeling of foregrounds,\ncommensurate with the vast improvements in sensitivity, have to be explored.\nHere, we study the inevitable effects of spatial averaging on the spectral\nshapes of typical foreground components, introducing a moment approach, which\nnaturally extends the list of foreground parameters that have to be determined\nthrough measurements or constrained by theoretical models. Foregrounds are\nthought of as a superposition of individual emitting volume elements along the\nline of sight and across the sky, which then are observed through an\ninstrumental beam. The beam and line of sight averages are inevitable. Instead\nof assuming a specific model for the distributions of physical parameters, our\nmethod identifies natural new spectral shapes for each foreground component\nthat can be used to extract parameter moments (e.g., mean, dispersion,\ncross-terms, etc.). The method is illustrated for the superposition of\npower-laws, free-free spectra, gray-body and modified blackbody spectra, but\ncan be applied to more complicated fundamental spectral energy distributions.\nHere, we focus on intensity signals but the method can be extended to the case\nof polarized emission. The averaging process automatically produces\nscale-dependent spectral shapes and the moment method can be used to propagate\nthe required information across scales in power spectrum estimates. The\napproach is not limited to applications to CMB foregrounds but could also be\nuseful for the modeling of X-ray emission in clusters of galaxies.\n", "  Gravitational lensing allows to quantify the angular distribution of the\nconvergence field around clusters of galaxies to constrain their connectivity\nto the cosmic web. We describe in this paper the corresponding theory in\nLagrangian space where analytical results can be obtained by identifying\nclusters to peaks in the initial field. We derive the three-point Gaussian\nstatistics of a two-dimensional field and its first and second derivatives. The\nformalism allows us to study the statistics of the field in a shell around a\ncentral peak, in particular its multipolar decomposition. The peak condition is\nshown to significantly remove power from the dipolar contribution and to modify\nthe monopole and quadrupole. As expected, higher order multipoles are not\nsignificantly modified by the constraint. Analytical predictions are\nsuccessfully checked against measurements in Gaussian random fields. The effect\nof substructures and radial weighting is shown to be small and does not change\nthe qualitative picture. The non-linear evolution is shown to induce a\nnon-linear bias of all multipoles proportional to the cluster mass.We predict\nthe Gaussian and weakly non-Gaussian statistics of multipolar moments of a\ntwo-dimensional field around a peak as a proxy for the azimuthal distribution\nof the convergence field around a cluster of galaxies. A quantitative estimate\nof this multipolar decomposition of the convergence field around clusters in\nnumerical simulations of structure formation and in observations will be\npresented in two forthcoming papers.\n", "  Topological phononic states, facilitating acoustic unique transports\nimmunizing to defects and disorders, have significantly revolutionized our\nscientific cognition of acoustic wave systems. Up to now, the theoretical and\nexperimental demonstrations of topologically protected one-way transports with\npseudospin states in a phononic crystal beyond the graphene lattice with C6v\nsymmetry are still unexploited. Furthermore, the tunable topological states, in\nform of robust reconfigurable acoustic pathways, have been evaded in the\ntopological phononic insulators. Here, we realize a topological phase\ntransition in the double Dirac degenerate cone of rotatable triangular phononic\ncrystals with C3v symmetry, by introducing the zone folding mechanism. Along a\ntopological domain wall between two portions of phononic crystals with distinct\ntopological phases, we experimentally observe the quantum spin Hall (QSH)\neffect for sound, characterized by the robust pseudospin-dependent one-way edge\nmodel. As the triangular phononic crystals can freely rotate, we\nstraightforward reconfigure an arbitrary contour defined by the topological\ndomain wall along which the acoustic waves can unimpededly transport. Our\nresearch develops a new route for the exploration of the topological phenomena\nin experiments and provides an excellent framework for freely steering the\nacoustic immune-backscattering propagation within topological phononic\nstructures.\n", "  A huge amount of data has been acquired with the GREGOR Fabry-P\\'erot\nInterferometer (GFPI), large-format facility cameras, and since 2016 with the\nHigh-resolution Fast Imager (HiFI). These data are processed in standardized\nprocedures with the aim of providing science-ready data for the solar physics\ncommunity. For this purpose, we have developed a user-friendly data reduction\npipeline called \"sTools\" based on the Interactive Data Language (IDL) and\nlicensed under creative commons license. The pipeline delivers reduced and\nimage-reconstructed data with a minimum of user interaction. Furthermore,\nquick-look data are generated as well as a webpage with an overview of the\nobservations and their statistics. All the processed data are stored online at\nthe GREGOR GFPI and HiFI data archive of the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics\nPotsdam (AIP). The principles of the pipeline are presented together with\nselected high-resolution spectral scans and images processed with sTools.\n", "  Non-Markovian stochastic Schr\\\"odinger equations (NMSSE) are important tools\nin quantum mechanics, from the theory of open systems to foundations. Yet, in\ngeneral, they are but formal objects: their solution can be computed\nnumerically only in some specific cases or perturbatively. This article is\nfocused on the NMSSE themselves rather than on the open-system evolution they\nunravel and aims at making them less abstract. Namely, we propose to write the\nstochastic realizations of linear NMSSE as averages over the solutions of an\nauxiliary equation with an additional random field. Our method yields a\nnon-perturbative numerical simulation algorithm for generic linear NMSSE that\ncan be made arbitrarily accurate for reasonably short times. For isotropic\ncomplex noises, the method extends from linear to non-linear NMSSE and allows\nto sample the solutions of norm-preserving NMSSE directly.\n", "  The stabilization of lasers to absolute frequency references is a fundamental\nrequirement in several areas of atomic, molecular and optical physics. A range\nof techniques are available to produce a suitable reference onto which one can\n'lock' the laser, many of which depend on the specific internal structure of\nthe reference or are sensitive to laser intensity noise. We present a novel\nmethod using the frequency modulation of an acousto-optic modulator's carrier\n(drive) signal to generate two spatially separated beams, with a frequency\ndifference of only a few MHz. These beams are used to probe a narrow absorption\nfeature and the difference in their detected signals leads to a dispersion-like\nfeature suitable for wavelength stabilization of a diode laser. This simple and\nversatile method only requires a narrow absorption line and is therefore\nsuitable for both atomic and cavity based stabilization schemes. To demonstrate\nthe suitability of this method we lock an external cavity diode laser near the\n$^{85}\\mathrm{Rb}\\,5S_{1/2}\\rightarrow5P_{3/2}, F=3\\rightarrow F^{\\prime}=4$\nusing sub-Doppler pump probe spectroscopy and also demonstrate excellent\nagreement between the measured signal and a theoretical model.\n", "  A new generation of solar instruments provides improved spectral, spatial,\nand temporal resolution, thus facilitating a better understanding of dynamic\nprocesses on the Sun. High-resolution observations often reveal\nmultiple-component spectral line profiles, e.g., in the near-infrared He I\n10830 \\AA\\ triplet, which provides information about the chromospheric velocity\nand magnetic fine structure. We observed an emerging flux region, including two\nsmall pores and an arch filament system, on 2015 April 17 with the 'very fast\nspectroscopic mode' of the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) situated at the\n1.5-meter GREGOR solar telescope at Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain. We\ndiscuss this method of obtaining fast (one per minute) spectral scans of the\nsolar surface and its potential to follow dynamic processes on the Sun. We\ndemonstrate the performance of the 'very fast spectroscopic mode' by tracking\nchromospheric high-velocity features in the arch filament system.\n", "  We investigate the stationary and dynamical behavior of an Anderson localized\nchain coupled to a single central bound state. The coupling to the central site\npartially dilutes the Anderson localized peak towards the nearly resonant\nsites. In particular, the number of resonantly coupled sites remains finite in\nthe thermodynamic limit. This is further supported by a multifractal analysis\nof eigenstates that shows the frozen spectrum of fractal dimension, which is\ncharacteristic for localized phases in models with power-law hopping. Although\nthe well-known Fano-resonance problem is seemingly similar to our system, it\nfails to describe it because of the absence of level repulsion within the\nenergy spectrum. For weak coupling strengths to the central site, we identify a\nregime with a logarithmic in time transport of particles and information.\n", "  We study the complexity of classically sampling from the output distribution\nof an Ising spin model, which can be implemented naturally in a variety of\natomic, molecular, and optical systems. In particular, we construct a specific\nexample of an Ising Hamiltonian that, after time evolution starting from a\ntrivial initial state, produces a particular output configuration with\nprobability very nearly proportional to the square of the permanent of a matrix\nwith arbitrary integer entries. In a similar spirit to BosonSampling, the\nability to sample classically from the probability distribution induced by time\nevolution under this Hamiltonian would imply unlikely complexity theoretic\nconsequences, suggesting that the dynamics of such a spin model cannot be\nefficiently simulated with a classical computer. Physical Ising spin systems\ncapable of achieving problem-size instances (i.e. qubit numbers) large enough\nso that classical sampling of the output distribution is classically difficult\nin practice may be achievable in the near future. Unlike BosonSampling, our\ncurrent results only imply hardness of exact classical sampling, leaving open\nthe important question of whether a much stronger approximate-sampling hardness\nresult holds in this context. As referenced in a recent paper of Bouland,\nMancinska, and Zhang (A. Bouland, L. Mancinska, and X. Zhang, CCC 2016, pp.\n28:1-28:33), our result completes the sampling hardness classification of\ntwo-qubit commuting Hamiltonians.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis on the hopping between monolayer CuO$_2$ and\nbulk CuO$_2$ plane in the Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ substrate. With a\ntwo-band model, we demonstrate that the nodeless gap can only exist when the\nhole concentration in monolayer CuO$_2$ plane is very large or very small. We\nargued that the possible phase separation may play important role in the recent\nexperimental observation of nodeless gap.\n", "  The holographic complexity is UV divergent. As a finite complexity, we\npropose a \"regularized complexity\" by employing a similar method to the\nholographic renormalization. We add codimension-two boundary counterterms which\ndo not contain any boundary stress tensor information. It means that we\nsubtract only non-dynamic background and all the dynamic information of\nholographic complexity is contained in the regularized part. After showing the\ngeneral counterterms for both CA and CV conjectures in holographic spacetime\ndimension 5 and less, we give concrete examples: the BTZ black holes and the\nfour and five dimensional Schwarzschild AdS black holes. We propose how to\nobtain the counterterms in higher spacetime dimensions and show explicit\nformulas only for some special cases with enough symmetries. We also compute\nthe complexity of formation by using the regularized complexity.\n", "  This article continues our recent publication [I.A. Baburin and D.M.\nProserpio and V.A. Saleev and A.V. Shipilova, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.17, 1332\n(2015)] where we have presented a comprehensive computational study of sp3\ncarbon allotropes based on the topologies proposed for zeolites. Here we\npredict six new silicon and six new germanium allotropes which have the same\nspace group symmetries and topologies as those predicted earlier for the carbon\nallotropes, and study their structural, elastic, vibrational, electronic and\noptical properties.\n", "  In this work, we provide two complementary perspectives for the (spectral)\nstability of solitary traveling waves in Hamiltonian nonlinear dynamical\nlattices, of which the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam and the Toda lattice are prototypical\nexamples. One is as an eigenvalue problem for a stationary solution in a\nco-traveling frame, while the other is as a periodic orbit modulo shifts. We\nconnect the eigenvalues of the former with the Floquet multipliers of the\nlatter and based on this formulation derive an energy-based spectral stability\ncriterion. It states that a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for a\nchange in the wave stability occurs when the functional dependence of the\nenergy (Hamiltonian) $H$ of the model on the wave velocity $c$ changes its\nmonotonicity. Moreover, near the critical velocity where the change of\nstability occurs, we provide explicit leading-order computation of the unstable\neigenvalues, based on the second derivative of the Hamiltonian $H\"(c_0)$\nevaluated at the critical velocity $c_0$. We corroborate this conclusion with a\nseries of analytically and numerically tractable examples and discuss its\nparallels with a recent energy-based criterion for the stability of discrete\nbreathers.\n", "  We propose potential geometry for fabrication of the graphite sheets with\natomically smooth edges. For such sheets with Bernal stacking, the\nelectron-electron interaction and topology should cause sufficiently high\ndensity of states resulting in the high temperature of either spin ordering or\nsuperconducting pairing.\n", "  The TASEP is a paradigmatic model of out-of-equilibrium statistical physics,\nfor which many quantities have been computed, either exactly or by approximate\nmethods. In this work we study two new kinds of observables that have some\nrelevance in biological or traffic models. They represent the probability for a\ngiven clearance zone of the lattice to be empty (for the first time) at a given\ntime, starting from a step density profile. Exact expressions are obtained for\nsingle-time quantities, while more involved history-dependent observables are\nstudied by Monte Carlo simulation, and partially predicted by a\nphenomenological approach.\n", "  The inclusive spectra of preequilibrium nucleons produced in low-energy\nantiproton-nucleus collisions are thoroughly investigated within the framework\nof the Lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics model for the first time. All\npossible reaction channels such as elastic scattering, annihilation, charge\nexchange and inelastic scattering in antibaryon-baryon, baryon-baryon and\nmeson-baryon collisions have been included in the transport model. The\nunexpected neutron/proton ratio in comparison to the pion and proton induced\nreactions is caused from the isospin effects of pion-nucleon collisions and the\ndensity dependence of symmetry energy. It is found that the $\\pi^{-}$-neutron\ncollisions enhance the neutron emission in the antiproton annihilation in a\nnucleus. Different to heavy-ion collisions, the isospin effects are pronounced\nat the low kinetic energies. A soft symmetry energy with the stiffness of\n$\\gamma_{s}=$0.5 at subsaturation densities is constrained from the available\ndata of the neutron/proton spectra.\n", "  We show analytically that the spectral density of the $q$-body\nSachdeev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model agrees with that of Q-Hermite polynomials with Q\na non-trivial function of $q \\ge 2$ and the number of Majorana fermions $N \\gg\n1$. Numerical results, obtained by exact diagonalization, are in excellent\nagreement with the analytical spectral density even for relatively small $N\n\\sim 8$. For $N \\gg 1$ and not close to the edge of the spectrum, we find the\nmacroscopic spectral density simplifies to $\\rho(E) \\sim\n\\exp[2\\arcsin^2(E/E_0)/\\log \\eta]$, where $\\eta$ is the suppression factor of\nthe contribution of intersecting Wick contractions relative to nested\ncontractions. This spectral density reproduces the known result for the free\nenergy in the large $q$ and $N$ limit. In the infrared region, where the SYK\nmodel is believed to have a gravity-dual, the spectral density is given by\n$\\rho(E) \\sim \\sinh[2\\pi \\sqrt 2 \\sqrt{(1-E/E_0)/(-\\log \\eta)}]$. It therefore\nhas a square-root edge, as in random matrix ensembles, followed by an\nexponential growth, a distinctive feature of black holes and also of low energy\nnuclear excitations. Results for level-statistics in this region confirm the\nagreement with random matrix theory. Physically this is a signature that, for\nsufficiently long times, the SYK model and its gravity dual evolve to a fully\nergodic state whose dynamics only depends on the global symmetry of the system.\nOur results strongly suggest that random matrix correlations are a universal\nfeature of quantum black holes and that the SYK model, combined with\nholography, may be relevant to model certain aspects of the nuclear dynamics.\n", "  We investigate the phase diagrams of the effective spin models derived from\nFermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, using\nstring bond states, one of the quantum tensor network states methods. We focus\non the role of quantum fluctuation effect in stabilizing the exotic spin phases\nin these models. For boson systems, and when the ratio between inter-particle\nand intra-particle interaction $\\lambda > 1$, the out-of-plane ferromagnetic\n(FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases obtained from quantum simulations are\nthe same to those obtained from classic model. However, the quantum\norder-by-disorder effect reduces the classical in-plane XY-FM and XY-vortex\nphases to the quantum X/Y-FM and X/Y-stripe phase when $\\lambda < 1$. The\nspiral phase and skyrmion phase can be realized in the presence of quantum\nfluctuation. For the Fermi-Hubbard model, the quantum fluctuation energies are\nalways important in the whole parameter regime. %, which are much larger than\nthose of the Bose model. A general picture to understand the phase diagrams\nfrom symmetry point of view is also presented.\n", "  We present a statistical method to derive the stellar density profiles of the\nMilky Way from spectroscopic survey data, taking into account selection\neffects. We assume that the selection function of the spectroscopic survey is\nbased on photometric colors and magnitudes and possibly altered during\nobservations and data reductions. Then the underlying selection function for a\nline-of-sight can be well recovered by comparing the distribution of the\nspectroscopic stars in a color-magnitude plane with that of the photometric\ndataset. Subsequently, the stellar density profile along a line-of-sight can be\nderived from the spectroscopically measured stellar density profile multiplied\nby the selection function. The method is validated using Galaxia mock data with\ntwo different selection functions. We demonstrate that the derived stellar\ndensity profiles well reconstruct the true ones not only for the full targets,\nbut also for the sub-populations selected from the full dataset. Finally, the\nmethod is applied to map the density profiles for the Galactic disk and halo,\nrespectively, using the LAMOST RGB stars. The Galactic disk extends to about\nR=19 kpc, where the disk still contributes about 10% to the total stellar\nsurface density. Beyond this radius, the disk smoothly transitions to the halo\nwithout any truncation, bending, or broken. Moreover, no over-density\ncorresponding to the Monoceros ring is found in the Galactic anti-center\ndirection. The disk shows moderate north-south asymmetry at radii larger than\n12 kpc. On the other hand, the R-Z tomographic map directly shows that the\nstellar halo is substantially oblate within a Galactocentric radius of 20 kpc\nand gradually becomes nearly spherical beyond 30 kpc.\n", "  Emission signatures from galactic winds provide an opportunity to directly\nmap the outflowing gas, but this is traditionally challenging because of the\nlow surface brightness. Using deep observations (27 hours) of the Hubble Deep\nField South from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument, we\nidentify signatures of an outflow in both emission and absorption from a\nspatially resolved galaxy at z = 1.29 with a stellar mass M* = 8 x 10^9 Msun,\nstar formation rate SFR = 77 Msun/yr, and star formation rate surface\nbrightness 1.6 Msun/kpc^2 within the [OII] half-light radius R_1/2,[OII] = 2.76\n+- 0.17 kpc. From a component of the strong resonant MgII and FeII absorptions\nat -350 km/s, we infer a mass outflow rate that is comparable to the star\nformation rate. We detect non-resonant FeII* emission, at lambda 2626, 2612,\n2396, and 2365, at 1.2-2.4-1.5-2.7 x 10^-18 egs s-1 cm-2 respectively. These\nflux ratios are consistent with the expectations for optically thick gas. By\ncombining the four non-resonant FeII* emission lines, we spatially map the\nFeII* emission from an individual galaxy for the first time. The FeII* emission\nhas an elliptical morphology that is roughly aligned with the galaxy minor\nkinematic axis, and its integrated half-light radius R_1/2,FeII* = 4.1 +- 0.4\nkpc is 50% larger than the stellar continuum (R_1/2,* = 2.34 +- 0.17 kpc) or\nthe [OII] nebular line. Moreover, the FeII* emission shows a blue wing\nextending up to -400 km/s, which is more pronounced along the galaxy minor\nkinematic axis and reveals a C-shaped pattern in a p-v diagram along that axis.\nThese features are consistent with a bi-conical outflow.\n", "  We show that a transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer with a radiatively\nbroadened exciton resonance would exhibit perfect extinction of a transmitted\nfield. This result holds for s- or p-polarized weak resonant light fields at\nany incidence angle, due to the conservation of in-plane momentum of excitons\nand photons in a flat defect-free two dimensional crystal. In contrast to\nextinction experiments with single quantum emitters, exciton-exciton\ninteractions lead to an enhancement of reflection with increasing power for\nincident fields that are blue detuned with respect to the exciton resonance. We\nshow that the interactions limit the maximum reflection that can be achieved by\ndepleting the incoming coherent state into an outgoing two-mode squeezed state.\n", "  Dynamical scanning of the Higgs mass by an axion-like particle during\ninflation may provide a cosmological component to explaining part of the\nhierarchy problem. We propose a novel interplay of this cosmological relaxation\nmechanism with inflation, whereby the backreaction of the Higgs vacuum\nexpectation value near the weak scale causes inflation to end. As Hubble drops,\nthe relaxion's dissipative friction increases relative to Hubble and slows it\ndown enough to be trapped by the barriers of its periodic potential. Such a\nscenario raises the natural cut-off of the theory up to $\\sim 10^{10}$ GeV,\nwhile maintaining a minimal relaxion sector without having to introduce\nadditional scanning scalars or new physics coincidentally close to the weak\nscale.\n", "  We study the Mass Discrepancy-Acceleration Relation (MDAR) of 57 elliptical\ngalaxies by their Einstein rings from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS). The\nmass discrepancy between the lensing mass and the baryonic mass derived from\npopulation synthesis is larger when the acceleration of the elliptical galaxy\nlenses is smaller. The MDAR is also related to surface mass density\ndiscrepancy. At the Einstein ring, these lenses belong to high-surface-mass\ndensity galaxies. Similarly, we find that the discrepancy between the lensing\nand stellar surface mass density is small. It is consistent with the recent\ndiscovery of dynamical surface mass density discrepancy in disk galaxies where\nthe discrepancy is smaller when surface density is larger. We also find\nrelativistic modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) can naturally explain the MDAR\nand surface mass density discrepancy in 57 Einstein rings. Moreover, the\nlensing mass, the dynamical mass and the stellar mass of these galaxies are\nconsistent with each other in relativistic MOND.\n", "  A large fraction of baryons predicted from the standard cosmology has been\nmissing observationally. Although previous numerical simulations have indicated\nthat most of the missing baryons reside in large-scale filaments in the form of\nWarm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM), it is generally very difficult to detect\nsignatures from such a diffuse gas. In this work, we focus on the hyperfine\ntransition of neutral hydrogen (HI) called 21-cm line as a tool to trace the\nWHIM. For the purpose, we first construct the map of the 21-cm signals by using\nthe data provided by the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation\nproject, Illustris, in which detailed processes affecting the dynamical and\nthermal evolution of the WHIM are implemented. From the comparison with the\nconstructed 21-cm signal map with the expected noise level of the Square\nKilometre Array phase 1 mid-frequency instrument (SKA1-mid), we find that the\n21-cm signals from the filamentary structures at redshifts z=0.5-3 are\ndetectable with the SKA1-mid if we assume the angular resolution of\n\\Delta\\theta > 10 arcmin and the observing time of t_obs > 100 hours. However,\nit also turns out that the signals mainly come from galaxies residing in the\nfilamentary structures and the contribution from the WHIM is too small to\ndetect with the SKA1-mid. Our results suggest that about 10 times higher\nsensitivity than the SKA1-mid is possibly enough to detect the WHIM at z=0.5-3.\n", "  The traditional method for computation in either the surface code or in the\nRaussendorf model is the creation of holes or \"defects\" within the encoded\nlattice of qubits that are manipulated via topological braiding to enact logic\ngates. However, this is not the only way to achieve universal, fault-tolerant\ncomputation. In this work, we focus on the Lattice Surgery representation,\nwhich realizes transversal logic operations without destroying the intrinsic 2D\nnearest-neighbor properties of the braid-based surface code and achieves\nuniversality without defects and braid based logic. For both techniques there\nare open questions regarding the compilation and resource optimization of\nquantum circuits. Optimization in braid-based logic is proving to be difficult\nand the classical complexity associated with this problem has yet to be\ndetermined. In the context of lattice-surgery-based logic, we can introduce an\noptimality condition, which corresponds to a circuit with the lowest resource\nrequirements in terms of physical qubits and computational time, and prove that\nthe complexity of optimizing a quantum circuit in the lattice surgery model is\nNP-hard.\n", "  The distributions of transverse momentum and longitudinal momentum fraction\nof charged particles in jets are measured in Pb+Pb and pp collisions with the\nATLAS detector at the LHC. The distributions are measured as a function of jet\ntransverse momentum and rapidity. The analysis utilises an integrated\nluminosity of 0.14 nb$^{-1}$ of Pb+Pb data and 4.0 pb$^{-1}$ of pp data\ncollected in 2011 and 2013, respectively, at the same centre-of-mass energy of\n2.76 TeV per colliding nucleon pair. The distributions measured in pp\ncollisions are used as a reference for those measured in Pb+Pb collisions in\norder to evaluate the impact on the internal structure of jets from the jet\nenergy loss of fast partons propagating through the hot, dense medium created\nin heavy-ion collisions. Modest but significant centrality-dependent\nmodifications of fragmentation functions in Pb+Pb collisions with respect to\nthose in pp collisions are seen. No significant dependence of modifications on\njet $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and rapidity selections is observed except for the\nfragments with the highest transverse momenta for which some reduction of\nyields is observed for more forward jets.\n", "  A longitudinal magnetic field with a strength of 5.2kG was recently detected\nin CPD -62 2124, which has a fractional main-sequence lifetime of about 60%.\nStrongly magnetic early-B type chemically peculiar stars in an advanced\nevolutionary state are of special interest to understand the evolution of the\nangular momentum and spin-down timescales in the presence of a global magnetic\nfield. We exploited 17 FORS2 low-resolution spectropolarimetric observations\nand 844 ASAS3 photometric measurements for the determination of the rotation\nperiod, pulsations, and the magnetic field geometry of the star. We calculated\nperiodograms and applied phenomenological models of photometric, spectral and\nspectropolarimetric variability. We found that all quantities studied,\nspecifically equivalent widths, the mean longitudinal magnetic field <B_z>, and\nthe flux in the V filter, vary with the same period P = 2.628d, which was\nidentified as the rotation period. The observed variations can be fully\nexplained by a rigidly rotating main-sequence star with an uneven distribution\nof chemical elements, photometric spots, and a stable, nearly dipolar magnetic\nfield with a polar field strength of about 21kG, frozen into the body of the\nstar. The magnetic field of CPD -62 2124 is tilted to the rotation axis by\nbeta=28+-7deg, while the inclination of the rotation axis towards the line of\nsight is only i=20+-5deg. In the acquired FORS2 spectra, we detect short-term\nline profile variations indicating the presence of beta Cephei type pulsations.\nAs of today, no other pulsating star of this type is known to possess such a\nstrong magnetic field.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the electronic structure of the layered\nsemiconductor InSe using density functional theory. We calculate the band\nstructure of the monolayer and bulk material with the band gap corrected using\nhybrid functionals. The band gap of the monolayer is 2.4 eV. The band edge\nstates are surprising isotropic. The electron affinities and band offsets are\nthen calculated for heterostructures as would be used in tunnel field effect\ntransistors (TFETs). The ionization potential of InSe is quite large, similar\nto that of HfSe2 or SnSe2, and so InSe is suitable to act as the drain in the\nTFET. The intrinsic defects are then calculated. For Se-rich layers, the Se\nadatom is the lowest energy defect, whereas for In-rich layers, the In adatom\nis most stable for Fermi energies across most of the gap. Both substitutional\ndonors and acceptors are calculated to be shallow, and not reconstructed.\nFinally, the Schottky barriers of metals are found to be strongly pinned, with\nthe Fermi level pinned by metal induced gap states about 0.5 eV above the\nvalence band edge.\n", "  We study the electronic and optical properties of strained single-layer SnC\nin the density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding models. We extract the\nhopping parameters tight-binding Hamiltonian for monolayer SnC by considering\nthe DFT results as a reference point. We also examine the phonon spectra in the\nscheme of DFT, and analyze the bonding character by using Mulliken bond\npopulation. Moreover, we show that the band gap modulation and transition from\nindirect to direct band gap in the compressive strained SnC. The applied\ntensile strain reduces the band gap and eventually the semiconductor to\nsemimetal transition occurs for 7.5\\% of tensile strain. In the framework of\ntight-binding model, the effect of spin-orbit coupling on energy spectrum are\nalso discussed. We indicate that while tensile strain closes the band gap,\nspin-orbit gap is still present which is order of $\\sim 40$ meV at the $\\Gamma$\npoint. The substrate effect is modeled through a staggered sub-lattice\npotential in the tight-binding approximation. The optical properties of\npristine and strained SnC are also examined in the DFT scheme. We present the\nmodulation of real and imaginary parts of dielectric function under applied\nstrain.\n", "  We present new limits on the amplitude of potential primordial magnetic\nfields (PMFs) using temperature and polarization measurements of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) from Planck, BICEP2/Keck Array, POLARBEAR, and\nSPTpol. We reduce twofold the 95% CL upper limit on the CMB anisotropy power\ndue to a nearly-scale-invariant PMF, with an allowed B-mode power at\n$\\ell=1500$ of $D_{\\ell=1500}^{BB} < 0.071 \\mu K^2$ for Planck versus\n$D_{\\ell=1500}^{BB} < 0.034 \\mu K^2$ for the combined dataset. We also forecast\nthe expected limits from soon-to-deploy CMB experiments (like SPT-3G, Adv.\nACTpol, or the Simons Array) and the proposed CMB-S4 experiment. Future CMB\nexperiments should dramatically reduce the current uncertainties, by one order\nof magnitude for the near-term experiments and two orders of magnitude for the\nCMB-S4 experiment. The constraints from CMB-S4 have the potential to rule out\nmuch of the parameter space for PMFs.\n", "  In the last two decades, a nanostructuring paradigm has been successfully\napplied in a wide range of thermoelectric materials, resulting in significant\nreduction in thermal conductivity and superior thermoelectric performance.\nThese advances, however, have been accomplished without directly investigating\nthe local thermoelectric properties, even though local electric current can be\nmapped with high spatial resolution. In fact, there still lacks an effective\nmethod that links the macroscopic thermoelectric performance to the local\nmicrostructures and properties. Here, we show that local thermal conductivity\ncan be mapped quantitatively with good accuracy, nanometer resolution, and\none-to-one correspondence to the microstructure using a three-phase\nskutterudite as a model system. Scanning thermal microscopy combined with\nfinite element simulations demonstrate close correlation between sample\nconductivity and probe resistance, enabling us to distinguish thermal\nconductivities spanning orders of magnitude, yet resolving thermal variation\nacross a phase interface with small contrast. The technique thus provides a\npowerful tool to correlate local thermal conductivities, microstructures, and\nmacroscopic properties for nanostructured materials in general, and\nnanostructured thermoelectrics in particular.\n", "  We present ARPES data taken from the structurally simplest representative of\niron-based superconductors, FeSe, in a wide temperature range. Apart from the\nvariations related to the nematic transition, we detect very pronounced shifts\nof the dispersions on the scale of hundreds of kelvins. Remarkably, upon\nwarming the sample up, the band structure has a tendency to relax to the one\npredicted by conventional band structure calculations, right opposite to what\nis intuitively expected. Our findings shed light on the origin of the dominant\ninteraction shaping the electronic states responsible for high-temperature\nsuperconductivity in iron-based materials.\n", "  Network fluids are structured fluids consisting of chains and branches. They\nare characterized by unusual physical properties, such as, exotic bulk phase\ndiagrams, interfacial roughening and wetting transitions, and equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium gels. Here, we provide an overview of a selection of their\nequilibrium and dynamical properties. Recent research efforts towards bridging\nequilibrium and non-equilibrium studies are discussed, as well as several open\nquestions.\n", "  We generalize the concept of the spin-momentum locking to magnonic systems\nand derive the formula to calculate the spin expectation value for one-magnon\nstates of general two-body spin Hamiltonians. We give no-go conditions for\nmagnon spin to be independent of momentum. As examples of the magnon\nspin-momentum locking, we analyze a one-dimensional antiferromagnet with the\nN\\'eel order and two-dimensional kagome lattice antiferromagnets with the\n120$^\\circ$ structure. We find that the magnon spin depends on its momentum\neven when the Hamiltonian has the $z$-axis spin rotational symmetry, which can\nbe explained in the context of a singular band point or a $U(1)$ symmetry\nbreaking. A spin vortex in momentum space generated in a kagome lattice\nantiferromagnet has the winding number $Q=-2$, while the typical one observed\nin topological insulator surface states is characterized by $Q=+1$. A magnonic\nanalogue of the surface states, the Dirac magnon with $Q=+1$, is found in\nanother kagome lattice antiferromagnet. We also derive the sum rule for $Q$ by\nusing the Poincar\\'e-Hopf index theorem.\n", "  \\begin{abstract} The accelerated expansion of the universe can be interpreted\nas a tendency to satisfy the holographic equipartition. It can be expressed by\na simple law, $\\Delta V = \\Delta t\\left(N_{surf}-\\epsilon N_{bulk}\\right),$\nwhere $V$ is the Hubble volume in Plank units, $t$ is the cosmic time plank\nunits and $N_{surf/bulk}$ is the degrees of freedom on the horizon/bulk of the\nuniverse. We show that this holographic equipartition law effectively implies\nthe maximization of entropy. In the cosmological context, a system that obeys\nthe holographic equipartition law behaves as an ordinary macroscopic system\nthat proceeds to an equilibrium state of maximum entropy. We consider the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model of the universe and have shown that it is\nconsistent with the holographic equipartition law. Analyzing the entropy\nevolution we find that it also proceeds to an equilibrium state of maximum\nentropy.\n", "  A lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) calculation of the nuclear matrix\nelement relevant to the $nn\\to ppee\\overline{\\nu}_e\\overline{\\nu}_e$ transition\nis described in detail, expanding on the results presented in Ref. [1]. This\nmatrix element, which involves two insertions of the weak axial current, is an\nimportant input for phenomenological determinations of double-$\\beta$ decay\nrates of nuclei. From this exploratory study, performed using unphysical values\nof the quark masses, the long-distance deuteron-pole contribution to the matrix\nelement is separated from shorter-distance hadronic contributions. This\npolarizability, which is only accessible in double-weak processes, cannot be\nconstrained from single-$\\beta$ decay of nuclei, and is found to be smaller\nthan the long-distance contributions in this calculation, but non-negligible.\nIn this work, technical aspects of the LQCD calculations, and of the relevant\nformalism in the pionless effective field theory, are described. Further\ncalculations of the isotensor axial polarizability, in particular near and at\nthe physical values of the light-quark masses, are required for precise\ndeterminations of both two-neutrino and neutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay rates\nin heavy nuclei.\n", "  We present a detailed elemental abundance study of 90 F and G dwarf, turn-off\nand subgiant stars in the Galactic bulge. Based on high-resolution spectra\nacquired during gravitational microlensing events, stellar ages and abundances\nfor 11 elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Zn, Y and Ba) have been\ndetermined. We find that the Galactic bulge has a wide metallicity distribution\nwith significant peaks at [Fe/H]=-1.09, -0.63, -0.20, +0.12, +0.41. We also\nfind a high fraction of intermediate-age to young stars: at [Fe/H]>0 more than\n35 % are younger than 8 Gyr. For [Fe/H]<-0.5 most stars are 10 Gyr or older. We\nhave also identified several episodes when significant star formation in the\nbulge happened: 3, 6, 8, and 12 Gyr ago. We further find that the \"knee\" in the\nalpha-element abundance trends of the sub-solar metallicity bulge is located at\nabout 0.1 dex higher [Fe/H] than in the local thick disk. The Galactic bulge\nhas complex age and abundance properties that appear to be tightly connected to\nthe main Galactic stellar populations. In particular, the peaks in the\nmetallicity distribution, the star formation episodes, and the abundance\ntrends, show similarities with the properties of the Galactic thin and thick\ndisks. At the same time there are additional components not seen outside the\nbulge region, and that most likely can be associated with the Galactic bar. For\ninstance, the star formation rate appears to have been slightly faster in the\nbulge than in the local thick disk, which most likely is an indication of the\ndenser stellar environment closer to the Galactic centre. Our results\nstrengthen the observational evidence that support the idea of a secular origin\nfor the Galactic bulge, formed out of the other main Galactic stellar\npopulations present in the central regions of our Galaxy.\n", "  The trinity of so-called \"canonical\" wall-bounded turbulent flows, comprising\nthe zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer, abbreviated ZPG TBL,\nturbulent pipe flow and channel/duct flows has continued to receive intense\nattention as new and more reliable experimental data have become available.\nNevertheless, the debate on whether the logarithmic part of the mean velocity\nprofile, in particular the K\\'arm\\'an constant $\\kappa$, is identical for these\nthree canonical flows or flow-dependent is still ongoing. In this paper, which\nexpands upon Monkewitz and Nagib (24th ICTAM Conf., Montreal, 2016), the\nasymptotic matching requirement of equal $\\kappa$ in the log-law and in the\nexpression for the centerline/free-stream velocity is reiterated and shown to\npreclude a single universal log-law in the three canonical flows or at least\nmake it very unlikely. The current re-analysis of high quality mean velocity\nprofiles in ZPG TBL's, the Princeton \"Superpipe\" and in channels and ducts\nleads to a coherent description of (almost) all seemingly contradictory data\ninterpretations in terms of TWO logarithmic regions in pipes and channels: A\nuniversal interior, near-wall logarithmic region with the same parameters as in\nthe ZPG TBL, in particular $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{wall}} \\cong 0.384$, but only\nextending from around $150$ to around $10^3$ wall units, and shrinking with\nincreasing pressure gradient, followed by an exterior logarithmic region with a\nflow specific $\\kappa$ matching the logarithmic slope of the respective\nfree-stream or centerline velocity. The log-law parameters of the exterior\nlogarithmic region in channels and pipes are shown to depend monotonically on\nthe pressure gradient.\n", "  We realize a phenomenological study to examine the sensitivity on the\nmagnetic moment and electric dipole moment of the top quark through the\nprocesses $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow t \\bar{t}$, $e \\gamma \\rightarrow e\n\\gamma^{*} \\gamma \\rightarrow e t \\bar{t}$ and $e^{-} e^{+}\\rightarrow e^{-}\n\\gamma^{*} \\gamma^{*} e^{+} \\rightarrow e^{-} t \\bar{t}e^{+}$ at the CLIC. We\nfind that with a center-of-mass energy of the CLIC-1.4$\\hspace{0.8mm}TeV$,\nintegrated luminosity of ${\\cal L}=1500\\hspace{0.8mm}fb^{-1}$ and\nCLIC-3$\\hspace{1mm}TeV$, integrated luminosity of ${\\cal\nL}=2000\\hspace{0.8mm}fb^{-1}$ with systematic uncertainties of $\\delta_{sys}=0,\n5, 10\\hspace{1mm}\\%$ at the $95\\%\\hspace{1mm}C. L.$, it is possible the CLIC\nmay put limits on the electromagnetic dipole moments of the top quark $\\hat\na_V$ and $\\hat a_A$ with a sensitivity of ${\\cal O}(10^{-3}-10^{-2})$.\nTherefore, we show that the sensitivity with the CLIC data is much greater than\nthat for the LHC data.\n", "  We report on the first direct measurement of the emission character of\nquantum cascade laser based frequency combs, using intensity autocorrelation.\nThe correlation technique is based on fast electro-optic sampling, with a\nbandwidth optimized to match the emission spectra of the comb laser, centered\naround 2.5~THz. We find the output light to be amplitude and frequency\nmodulated at the same time, with intensity modulation depth as high as 90\\%,\noccuring on timescales as short as few picoseconds. We compare these findings\nwith intensity autocorrelation measurements of pulsed Terahertz light\noriginating from a photoconductive antenna and find very different results. We\nobserve no significant difference for the comb and dispersed regime. The\ntechnique will be of significant importance in future for the measurement of\nultra-short pulses from quantum cascade lasers.\n", "  We start with a Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP) related to a BD.I-type\nsymmetric spaces $SO(2r+1)/S(O(2r-2s +1)\\otimes O(2s))$, $s\\geq 1$. We consider\ntwo Riemann-Hilbert problems: the first formulated on the real axis\n$\\mathbb{R}$ in the complex $\\lambda$-plane; the second one is formulated on\n$\\mathbb{R} \\oplus i\\mathbb{R}$. The first RHP for $s=1$ allows one to solve\nthe Kulish-Sklyanin (KS) model; the second RHP is relevant for a new type of KS\nmodel. An important example for nontrivial deep reductions of KS model is\ngiven. Its effect on the scattering matrix is formulated. In particular we\nobtain new 2-component NLS equations. Finally, using the Wronskian relations we\ndemonstrate that the inverse scattering method for KS models may be understood\nas a generalized Fourier transforms. Thus we have a tool to derive all their\nfundamental properties, including the hierarchy of equations and the hierarchy\nof their Hamiltonian structures.\n", "  We consider a dark matter (DM) model offering a very natural explanation of\nthe observed relation, $\\Omega_{\\rm dark} \\sim \\Omega_{\\rm visible}$. This\ngeneric consequence of the model is a result of the common origin of both types\nof matter (DM and visible) which are formed during the same QCD transition. The\nmasses of both types of matter in this framework are proportional to one and\nthe same dimensional parameter of the system, $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}$. The focus of\nthe present work is the detail study of the dynamics of the $\\cal{CP}$-odd\ncoherent axion field $a(x)$ just before the QCD transition. We argue that the\nbaryon charge separation effect on the largest possible scales inevitably\noccurs as a result of merely existence of the coherent axion field in early\nUniverse. It leads to preferential formation of one species of nuggets on the\nscales of the visible Universe where the axion field $a(x)$ is coherent. A\nnatural outcome of this preferential evolution is that only one type of the\nvisible baryons remains in the system after the nuggets complete their\nformation. This represents a specific mechanism on how the baryon charge\nseparation mechanism (when the Universe is neutral, but visible part of matter\nconsists the baryons only) replaces the conventional \"baryogenesis\" scenarios.\n", "  We present significantly improved measurements of turbulent velocities in the\nhot gaseous halos of nearby giant elliptical galaxies. Using deep XMM-Newton\nReflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS ) observations and a combination of\nresonance scattering and direct line broadening methods, we obtain well bounded\nconstraints for 13 galaxies. Assuming that the turbulence is isotropic, we\nobtain a best fit mean 1D turbulent velocity of ~110 km/s. This implies a\ntypical 3D Mach number ~0.45 and a typical non-thermal pressure contribution of\n~6 per cent in the cores of nearby massive galaxies. The intrinsic scatter\naround these values is modest - consistent with zero, albeit with large\nstatistical uncertainty - hinting at a common and quasi-continuous mechanism\nsourcing the velocity structure in these objects. Using conservative estimates\nof the spatial scales associated with the observed turbulent motions, we find\nthat turbulent heating can be sufficient to offset radiative cooling in the\ninner regions of these galaxies (<10 kpc, typically 2-3 kpc). The full\npotential of our analysis methods will be enabled by future X-ray\nmicrocalorimeter observations.\n", "  We propose a protocol that achieves arbitrary N-qubit interactions between\nnuclear spins and that can measure directly nuclear many-body correlators by\nappropriately making the nuclear spins interact with a nitrogen vacancy (NV)\ncenter electron spin. The method takes advantage of recently introduced\ndynamical decoupling techniques and demonstrates that action on the electron\nspin is sufficient to fully exploit nuclear spins as robust quantum registers.\nOur protocol is general, being applicable to other nuclear spin based platforms\nwith electronic spin defects acting as mediators as the case of silicon\ncarbide.\n", "  Manipulation of acoustic wavefronts by thin and planar devices, known as\nmetasurfaces, has been extensively studied, in view of many important\napplications. Reflective and refractive metasurfaces are designed using the\ngeneralized reflection and Snell's laws, which tell that local phase shifts at\nthe metasurface supply extra momentum to the wave, presumably allowing\narbitrary control of reflected or transmitted waves. However, as it has been\nrecently shown for the electromagnetic counterpart, conventional metasurfaces\nbased on the generalized laws of reflection and refraction have important\ndrawbacks in terms of power efficiency. This work presents a new synthesis\nmethod of acoustic metasurfaces for anomalous reflection and transmission that\novercomes the fundamental limitations of conventional designs, allowing full\ncontrol of acoustic energy flow. The results show that different mechanisms are\nnecessary in the reflection and transmission scenarios for ensuring perfect\nperformance. Metasurfaces for anomalous reflection require non-local response,\nwhich allows energy channeling along the metasurface. On other hand, for\nperfect manipulation of anomalously transmitted waves, local and non-symmetric\nresponse is required. These conclusions are interpreted through appropriate\nsurface impedance models which are used to find possible physical\nimplementations of perfect metasurfaces in each scenario. We hope that this\nadvance in the design of acoustic metasurfaces opens new avenues not only for\nperfect anomalous reflection and transmission but also for realizing more\ncomplex functionalities, such as focusing, self-bending or vortex generation.\n", "  Concentration gradients play a critical role in embryogenesis, bacterial\nlocomotion, as well as the motility of active particles. Particles develop\nconcentration profiles around them by dissolution, adsorption, or the\nreactivity of surface species. These gradients change the surface energy of the\nparticles, driving both their self-propulsion and governing their interactions.\nHere we uncover a regime in which solute-gradients mediate interactions between\nslowly dissolving droplets without causing autophoresis. This decoupling allows\nus to directly measure the steady-state, repulsive force, which scales with\ninterparticle distance as $F\\sim {1/r^{2}}$. Our results show that the process\nis diffusion rather than reaction rate limited, and the theoretical model\ncaptures the dependence of the interactions on droplet size and solute\nconcentration, using a single fit parameter, $l=16\\pm 3$~nm, which corresponds\nto the lengthscale of a swollen micelle. Our results shed light on the\nout-of-equilibrium behavior of particles with surface reactivity.\n", "  Interfacial internal waves in a stratified fluid excited by periodic\nfree-surface perturbations in a closed tank are studied experimentally.\nBarotropic-baroclinic energy conversion is induced by the presence of a bottom\nobstacle. The connection between horizontal surface velocities and internal\nwave amplitudes is investigated, the developing flow patterns are described\nqualitatively, and the wave speeds of internal waves are systematically\nanalyzed and compared to linear 2- and 3-layer theories. We find that, despite\nof the fact that the observed internal waves can have considerable amplitudes,\na linear 3-layer approximation still gives fairly good agreement with the\nexperimental results.\n", "  We use BBN observational data on primordial abundance of ${}^4He$ to\nconstrain f(T) gravity. The three most studied viable $f(T)$ models, namely the\npower law, the exponential and the square-root exponential are considered, and\nthe BBN bounds are adopted in order to extract constraints on their free\nparameters. For the power-law model, we find that the constraints are in\nagreement with those acquired using late-time cosmological data. For the\nexponential and the square-root exponential models, we show that for realiable\nregions of parameters space they always satisfy the BBN bounds. We conclude\nthat viable f(T) models can successfully satisfy the BBN constraints.\n", "  Descent equations play an important role in the theory of characteristic\nclasses and find applications in theoretical physics, e.g. in the Chern-Simons\nfield theory and in the theory of anomalies. The second Chern class (the first\nPontrjagin class) is defined as $p= \\langle F, F\\rangle$ where $F$ is the\ncurvature 2-form and $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot\\rangle$ is an invariant scalar\nproduct on the corresponding Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. The descent for $p$\ngives rise to an element $\\omega=\\omega_3 + \\omega_2 + \\omega_1 + \\omega_0$ of\nmixed degree. The 3-form part $\\omega_3$ is the Chern-Simons form. The 2-form\npart $\\omega_2$ is known as the Wess-Zumino action in physics. The 1-form\ncomponent $\\omega_1$ is related to the canonical central extension of the loop\ngroup $LG$.\n  In this paper, we give a new interpretation of the low degree components\n$\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_0$. Our main tool is the universal differential calculus\non free Lie algebras due to Kontsevich. We establish a correspondence between\nsolutions of the first Kashiwara-Vergne equation in Lie theory and universal\nsolutions of the descent equation for the second Chern class $p$. In more\ndetail, we define a 1-cocycle $C$ which maps automorphisms of the free Lie\nalgebra to one forms. A solution of the Kashiwara-Vergne equation $F$ is mapped\nto $\\omega_1=C(F)$. Furthermore, the component $\\omega_0$ is related to the\nassociator corresponding to $F$. It is surprising that while $F$ and $\\Phi$\nsatisfy the highly non-linear twist and pentagon equations, the elements\n$\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_0$ solve the linear descent equation.\n", "  Quirks are particles that are both charged under the standard model and under\na new confining group. The quirk setup assumes there are no light flavors of\nthe new confining group so that while the theory is in a confining phase, the\ndistance between quirk-antiquirk pairs can be macroscopic. In this work, we\nreinterpret existing collider limits, those from monojet and heavy stable\ncharged particle searches, as limits on quirks. Additionally, we propose a new\nsearch in the magnetic-field-less CMS data for quirks and estimate the\nsensitivity. We focus on the region where the confinement scale is roughly\nbetween 1 eV and 100 eV and find mass constraints in the TeV-range, depending\non the quirk's quantum numbers.\n", "  In order to be efficient, spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys do not obtain\nredshifts for all galaxies in the population targeted. The missing galaxies are\noften clustered, commonly leading to a lower proportion of successful\nobservations in dense regions. One example is the close-pair issue for SDSS\nspectroscopic galaxy surveys, which have a deficit of pairs of observed\ngalaxies with angular separation closer than the hardware limit on placing\nneighbouring fibers. Spatially clustered missing observations will exist in the\nnext generations of surveys. Various schemes have previously been suggested to\nmitigate these effects, but none works for all situations. We argue that the\nsolution is to link the missing galaxies to those observed with statistically\nequivalent clustering properties, and that the best way to do this is to rerun\nthe targeting algorithm, varying the angular position of the observations.\nProvided that every pair has a non-zero probability of being observed in one\nrealisation of the algorithm, then a pair-upweighting scheme linking targets to\nsuccessful observations, can correct these issues. We present such a scheme,\nand demonstrate its validity using realisations of an idealised simple survey\nstrategy.\n", "  We study a possible symmetry restoration due to the radiative effect of\nparticles which are explosively produced in preheating after inflation. As its\napplication, we consider a scenario for leptogenesis based on the lepton number\nasymmetry generated in the right-handed neutrino sector through the inflaton\ndecay. The scenario is examined in a one-loop radiative neutrino mass model\nextended with singlet scalars.\n", "  We propose a class of Two Higgs Doublet Models where there are Flavour\nChanging Neutral Currents (FCNC) at tree level, but under control due to the\nintroduction of a discrete symmetry in the full Lagrangian. It is shown that in\nthis class of models, one can have simultaneously FCNC in the up and down\nsectors, in contrast to the situation encountered in BGL models. The intensity\nof FCNC is analysed and it is shown that in this class of models one can\nrespect all the strong constraints from experiment without unnatural\nfine-tuning. It is pointed out that the additional sources of flavour and CP\nviolation are such that they can enhance significantly the generation of the\nBaryon Asymmetry of the Universe, with respect to the Standard Model.\n", "  We discuss canonical transformations in Quantum Field Theory in the framework\nof the functional-integral approach. In contrast with ordinary Quantum\nMechanics, canonical transformations in Quantum Field Theory are mathematically\nmore subtle due to the existence of unitarily inequivalent representations of\ncanonical commutation relations. When one works with functional integrals, it\nis not immediately clear how this algebraic feature manifests itself in the\nformalism. Here we attack this issue by considering the canonical\ntransformations in the context of coherent-state functional integrals.\nSpecifically, in the case of linear canonical transformations, we derive the\ngeneral functional-integral representations for both transition amplitude and\npartition function phrased in terms of new canonical variables. By means of\nthis, we show how in the infinite-volume limit the canonical transformations\ninduce a transition from one representation of canonical commutation relations\nto another one and under what conditions the representations are unitarily\ninequivalent. We also consider the partition function and derive the energy gap\nbetween statistical systems described in two different representations which,\namong others, allows to establish a connection with continuous phase\ntransitions. We illustrate the inner workings of the outlined mechanism by\ndiscussing two prototypical systems: the van Hove model and the Bogoliubov\nmodel of weakly interacting Bose gas.\n", "  Evidence of surface magnetism is now observed on an increasing number of cool\nstars. The detailed manner by which dynamo-generated magnetic fields giving\nrise to starspots traverse the convection zone still remains unclear. Some\ninsight into this flux emergence mechanism has been gained by assuming bundles\nof magnetic field can be represented by idealized thin flux tubes (TFTs). Weber\n& Browning (2016) have recently investigated how individual flux tubes might\nevolve in a 0.3 solar-mass M dwarf by effectively embedding TFTs in\ntime-dependent flows representative of a fully convective star. We expand upon\nthis work by initiating flux tubes at various depths in the upper 50-75% of the\nstar in order to sample the differing convective flow pattern and differential\nrotation across this region. Specifically, we comment on the role of\ndifferential rotation and time-varying flows in both the suppression and\npromotion of the magnetic flux emergence process.\n", "  Recent discovery of many dwarf satellite galaxies in the direction of the\nSmall and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) provokes questions of their\norigins, and what they can reveal about galaxy evolution theory. Here, we\npredict the satellite stellar mass function of Magellanic Cloud-mass host\ngalaxies using abundance matching and reionization models applied to the\n\\textit{Caterpillar} simulations. Specifically focusing on the volume within\n$50$~kpc of the LMC, we predict a mean of 4-8 satellites with stellar mass $M_*\n> 10^4\\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, and 3-4 satellites with $80 < M_* \\leq 3000\\,\n\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$. Surprisingly, all $12$ currently known satellite candidates\nhave stellar masses of $80 < M_* \\leq 3000\\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$. Reconciling the\ndearth of large satellites and profusion of small satellites is challenging and\nmay require a combination of a major modification of the \\mstarmhalo\nrelationship (steep, but with an abrupt flattening at $10^3\\,\n\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$), late reionization for the Local Group ($z_{\\rm{reion}}\n\\lesssim 9$ preferred), and/or strong tidal stripping. We can more robustly\npredict that $\\sim 53\\%$ of satellites within this volume were accreted\ntogether with the LMC and SMC, and $\\sim 47\\%$ were only ever Milky Way\nsatellites. Observing satellites of isolated LMC-sized field galaxies is\nessential to placing the LMC in context, and to better constrain the\n\\mstarmhalo relationship. Modeling known LMC-sized galaxies within $8$ Mpc, we\npredict 1-6 (2-12) satellites with $M_* > 10^5\\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ ($M_* >\n10^4\\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) within the virial volume of each, and 1-3 (1-7)\nwithin a single $1.5^{\\circ}$ diameter field of view, making their discovery\nlikely.\n", "  The generation of droplets at low Reynolds numbers is driven by non-linear\ndynamics that give rise to complex patterns concerning both the\ndroplet-to-droplet spacing and the individual droplet sizes. Here we\ndemonstrate an experimental system in which a time-varying energy landscape\nprovides a periodic magnetic force that generates an array of droplets from an\nimmiscible mixture of ferrofluid and silicone oil. The resulting droplet\npatterns are periodic, owing to the nature of the magnetic force, yet the\ndroplet spacing and size can vary greatly by tuning a single bias pressure\napplied on the ferrofluid phase; for a given cycle period of the magnetic\nforce, droplets can be generated either at integer multiples (1, 2, etc.), or\nat rational fractions (3/2, 5/3, 5/2, etc.) of this period with mono- or\nmultidisperse droplet sizes. We develop a discrete-time dynamical systems model\nnot only to reproduce the phenotypes of the observed patterns but also provide\na framework for understanding systems driven by such periodic energy\nlandscapes.\n", "  We investigate a recently proposed UV-complete composite Higgs scenario in\nthe light of the first LHC runs. The model is based on a $SU(4)$ gauge group\nwith global flavour symmetry breaking $SU(5) \\to SO(5)$, giving rise to pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone bosons in addition to the Higgs doublet. This includes a real\nand a complex electroweak triplet with exotic electric charges. Including\nthese, as well as constraints on other exotic states, we show that LHC\nmeasurements are not yet sensitive enough to significantly constrain the\nmodel's low energy constants. The Higgs potential is described by two\nparameters which are on the one hand constrained by the LHC measurement of the\nHiggs mass and Higgs decay channels and on the other hand can be computed from\ncorrelation functions in the UV-complete theory. Hence to exclude the model at\nleast one constant needs to be determined and to validate the Higgs potential\nboth constants need to be reproduced by the UV-theory. Due to its\nUV-formulation, a certain number of low energy constants can be computed from\nfirst principle numerical simulations of the theory formulated on a lattice,\nwhich can help in establishing the validity of this model. We assess the\npotential impact of lattice calculations for phenomenological studies, as a\npreliminary step towards Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  A search is presented for massive spin-1 Z' resonances decaying to a top\nquark and a heavy vector-like top quark partner T. The search is based on a 2.6\ninverse femtobarns sample of proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV collected with\nthe CMS detector at the LHC. The analysis is optimized for final states in\nwhich the T quark decays to a W boson and a bottom quark. The focus is on\nall-jet final states in which both the W boson and the top quark decay into\nquarks that evolve into jets. The decay products of the top quark and of the W\nboson are assumed to be highly Lorentz-boosted and cannot be reconstructed as\nseparate jets, but are instead reconstructed as merged, wide jets. Techniques\nfor the identification of jet substructure and jet flavour are used to\ndistinguish signal from background events. Several models for Z' bosons\ndecaying to T quarks are excluded at 95% confidence level, with upper limits on\nthe cross section ranging from 0.13 to 10 pb, depending on the chosen\nhypotheses. This is the first search for a neutral spin-1 heavy resonance\ndecaying to a top quark and a vector-like T quark in the all-hadronic final\nstate.\n", "  The Scale Magnetic Effect (SME) is the generation of electric current due to\nconformal anomaly in external magnetic field in curved spacetime. The effect\nappears in a vacuum with electrically charged massless particles. Similarly to\nthe Hall effect, the direction of the induced anomalous current is\nperpendicular to the direction of the external magnetic field $\\bf B$ and to\nthe gradient of the conformal factor $\\tau$, while the strength of the current\nis proportional to the beta function of the theory. In massive electrodynamics\nthe SME remains valid, but the value of the induced current differs from the\ncurrent generated in the system of massless fermions. In the present paper we\nuse the Wigner--Weyl formalism to demonstrate that in accordance with the\ndecoupling property of heavy fermions the corresponding anomalous conductivity\nvanishes in the large-mass limit with $m^2 \\gg |e {\\bf B}|$ and $m \\gg |\\nabla\n\\tau|$.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the surface thermophysical properties (thermal\nemissivity, thermal inertia, roughness fraction and geometric albedo) of\nasteroid (99942) Apophis, using the currently available thermal infrared\nobservations of CanariCam on Gran Telescopio CANARIAS and far-infrared data by\nPACS of Herschel, on the basis of the Advanced thermophysical model. We show\nthat the thermal emissivity of Apophis should be wavelength dependent from\n$8.70~\\mu m$ to $160~\\mu m$, and the maximum emissivity may arise around\n$20~\\mu m$ similar to that of Vesta. Moreover, we further derive the thermal\ninertia, roughness fraction, geometric albedo and effective diameter of Apophis\nwithin a possible 1$\\sigma$ scale of\n$\\Gamma=100^{+100}_{-52}\\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$, $f_{\\rm r}=0.78\\sim1.0$,\n$p_{\\rm v}=0.286^{+0.030}_{-0.026}$, $D_{\\rm eff}=378^{+19}_{-25}\\rm~m$, and\n3$\\sigma$ scale of $\\Gamma=100^{+240}_{-100}\\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$, $f_{\\rm\nr}=0.2\\sim1.0$, $p_{\\rm v}=0.286^{+0.039}_{-0.029}$, $D_{\\rm\neff}=378^{+27}_{-29}\\rm~m$. The derived low thermal inertia but high roughness\nfraction may imply that Apophis could have regolith on its surface, and less\nregolith migration process has happened in comparison with asteroid Itokawa.\nOur results show that small-size asteroids could also have fine regolith on the\nsurface, and further infer that Apophis may be delivered from the Main Belt by\nYarkovsky effect.\n", "  Twin Higgs models solve the little hierarchy problem without introducing new\ncolored particles, however they are often in tension with measurements of the\nradiation density at late times. Here we explore viable cosmological histories\nfor Twin Higgs models. In particular, we show that mixing between the SM and\ntwin neutrinos can thermalize the two sectors below the twin QCD phase\ntransition, significantly reducing the twin sector's contribution to the\nradiation density. The requisite twin neutrino masses of order 1-20 GeV and\nmixing angle with SM neutrinos of 10^{-3} - 10^{-5} can be probed in a variety\nof current and planned experiments. We further find that these parameters can\nbe naturally accessed in a warped UV completion, where the neutrino sector can\nalso generate the Z2-breaking Higgs mass term needed to produce the hierarchy\nbetween the symmetry breaking scales f and v.\n", "  The two messenger results of the GeV gamma-ray excess at the Galactic center\nand a probable antiproton excess in the recent AMS-02 observation suggest that\nthese two anomalies may be owing to the same origin --- the dark matter (DM)\nannihilation into $b \\bar b$, while these results seem in tension with the\ndwarf spheroidal galaxy observations. To give a compatible explanation about\nit, we consider the pseudoscalar DM particles $S_d^+ S_d^-$ annihilating via\n$S_d^+ S_d^- \\rightarrow S_d^0 S_d^0$, with the process mediated by a new\nscalar $\\phi$ and $S_d^0$ quickly decaying into $b \\bar{b}$. For the particles\n$S_d^+$, $S_d^-$ and $S_d^0$ in a triplet with degenerate masses, the\nannihilation cross section of DM today is linearly dependent on the relative\nvelocity $v_r$, and thus constraints from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies are\nrelaxed. The parameter spaces are derived with corresponding constraints.\nThough traces from the new sector seem challenging to be disclosed at collider\nand in DM direct detections, the indirect search of the gamma-ray line from the\n$S_d^0$'s decay has the potential to shed light on DM annihilations, with the\nenergy of the gamma-ray line $\\sim m_{S_d^0} /2$, i.e. about 50$-$75 GeV.\n", "  We study how the shape of the spinwave resonance lines in rf-voltage induced\nFMR can be used to extract the spinwave density of states and the damping\nwithin the precessing layer in nanoscale tunnel junctions that possess\nperpendicular anisotropy. We work with a field applied along the easy axis to\npreserve the uniaxial symmetry of the system. We describe the set-up to study\nthe susceptibility contributions of the spin waves in the field-frequency\nspace. We then identify the maximum device size above which the spinwaves can\nno longer be studied in isolation as the linewidths of their responses make\nthem overlap. The rf-voltage induced signal is the sum of two voltages that\nhave comparable magnitudes: a first voltage that originates from the transverse\nsusceptibility and rectification by magnetoresistance and a second voltage that\narises from the non-linear longitudinal susceptibility and the resultant\ntime-averaged change of the micromagnetic configuration. The transverse and\nlongitudinal susceptibility signals have different dc bias dependences such\nthat they can be separated by measuring how the device rectifies the rf voltage\nat different dc bias voltages. The transverse and longitudinal susceptibility\nsignals have different lineshapes; their joint studies can yield the Gilbert\ndamping of the free layer of the device with a degree of confidence that\ncompares well with standard FMR. Our method is illustrated on FeCoB-based free\nlayers in which the individual spin-waves can be sufficiently resolved only for\ndisk diameters below 200 nm. The resonance line shapes on devices with 90 nm\ndiameters are consistent with a Gilbert damping of 0.011. This damping of 0.011\nexceeds the value of 0.008 measured on the unpatterned films, which indicates\nthat device-level measurements are needed for a correct evaluation of\ndissipation.\n", "  We present generalized versions of the concepts of seniority number and\nionicity. These generalized numbers count respectively the partially occupied\nand fully occupied shells for any partition of the orbital space into shells.\nThe Hermitian operators whose eigenspaces correspond to wave functions of\ndefinite generalized seniority or ionicity values are introduced. The\ngeneralized seniority numbers (GSNs) afford to establish refined hierarchies of\nconfiguration interaction (CI) spaces within those of fixed ordinary seniority.\nSuch a hierarchy is illustrated on the buckminsterfullerene molecule.\n", "  We propose a $d-$dimensional interacting Majorana fermion model with quenched\ndisorder, which gives us a continuous quantum phase transition between a\ndiffusive thermal metal phase with a finite entropy density to an insulator\nphase with zero entropy density. This model is based on coupled\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev model clusters, and hence has a controlled large-$N$ limit.\nThe metal-insulator transition is accompanied by a spontaneous time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking. We perform controlled calculations to show that the\ndiffusion constant jumps to zero discontinuously at the metal-insulator\ntransition, while the time-reversal symmetry breaking order parameter increases\ncontinuously.\n", "  GRB 120323A is a very intense short Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) detected\nsimultaneously during its prompt gamma-ray emission phase with the Gamma-ray\nBurst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the Konus\nexperiment on board the Wind satellite. GBM and Konus operate in the keV--MeV\nregime, however, the GBM range is broader both toward the low and the high\nparts of the gamma-ray spectrum. Analysis of such bright events provide a\nunique opportunity to check the consistency of the data analysis as well as\ncross-calibrate the two instruments. We performed time-integrated and coarse\ntime-resolved spectral analysis of GRB 120323A prompt emission. We conclude\nthat the analyses of GBM and Konus data are only consistent when using a\ndouble-hump spectral shape for both data sets; in contrast, the single-hump of\nthe empirical Band function, traditionally used to fit GRB prompt emission\nspectra, leads to significant discrepancies between GBM and Konus analysis\nresults. Our two-hump model is a combination of a thermal-like and a\nnon-thermal component. We interpret the first component as a natural\nmanifestation of the jet photospheric emission.\n", "  A central result in the study of Quantum Hamiltonian Complexity is that the\nk-Local hamiltonian problem is QMA-complete. In that problem, we must decide if\nthe lowest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian is bounded below some value, or above\nanother, promised one of these is true. Given the ground state of the\nHamiltonian, a quantum computer can determine this question, even if the ground\nstate itself may not be efficiently quantum preparable. Kitaev's proof of\nQMA-completeness encodes a unitary quantum circuit in QMA into the ground space\nof a Hamiltonian. However, we now have quantum computing models based on\nmeasurement instead of unitary evolution, furthermore we can use post-selected\nmeasurement as an additional computational tool. In this work, we generalise\nKitaev's construction to allow for non-unitary evolution including\npost-selection. Furthermore, we consider a type of post-selection under which\nthe construction is consistent, which we call tame post-selection. We consider\nthe computational complexity consequences of this construction and then\nconsider how the probability of an event upon which we are post-selecting\naffects the gap between the ground state energy and the energy of the first\nexcited state of its corresponding Hamiltonian. We provide numerical evidence\nthat the two are not immediately related, by giving a family of circuits where\nthe probability of an event upon which we post-select is exponentially small,\nbut the gap in the energy levels of the Hamiltonian decreases as a polynomial.\n", "  Recent theoretical advances have led to the creation of a unified phase\ndiagram for the thermal glass and athermal jamming transitions. This diagram\nmakes clear that, while related, the mode-coupling---or dynamic---glass\ntransition is distinct from the jamming transition, occurring at a finite\ntemperature and significantly lower density than the jamming transition.\nNonetheless, we demonstrate a pre-jamming transition in athermal frictionless\nspheres which occurs at the same density as the mode-coupling transition and is\nmarked by percolating clusters of locally rigid particles. At this density in\nboth the thermal and athermal systems, individual motions of an extensive\nnumber of particles become constrained, such that only collective motion is\npossible. This transition, which is well below jamming, exactly matches the\ndefinition of collective behavior at the dynamical transition of glasses. Thus,\nwe reveal that the genesis of rigidity in both thermal and athermal systems is\ngoverned by the same underlying topological transition in their shared\nconfiguration space.\n", "  X-ray reverberation lags from the vicinity of supermassive black holes have\nbeen detected in almost 30 AGN. The soft lag, which is the time delay between\nthe hard and soft X-ray light curves, is usually interpreted as the time\ndifference between the direct and reflected emission, but is alternatively\nsuggested to arise from the direct and scattering emission from distant clouds.\nBy analysing the archival Suzaku observations totalling an exposure time of ~\n770 ks, we discover a soft lag of $10\\pm3.4$ ks at $9.58\\times10^{-6}$ Hz in\nthe luminous quasar PDS 456, which is the longest soft lag and lowest Fourier\nfrequency reported to date. In this study, we use the maximum likelihood method\nto deal with non-continuous nature of the Suzaku light curves. The result\nfollows the mass-scaling relation for soft lags, which further supports that\nsoft lags originate from the innermost areas of AGN and hence are best\ninterpreted by the reflection scenario. Spectral analysis has been performed in\nthis work and we find no evidence of clumpy partial-covering absorbers. The\nspectrum can be explained by a self-consistent relativistic reflection model\nwith warm absorbers, and spectral variations over epochs can be accounted for\nby the change of the continuum, and of column density and ionization states of\nthe warm absorbers.\n", "  We present holographic desciptions of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking\nmodels that incorporate the top mass generation mechanism. The models allow\ncomputation of the spectrum in the presence of large anomalous dimensions due\nto walking and strong NJL interactions. Technicolour and QCD dynamics are\ndescribed by the bottom-up Dynamic AdS/QCD model for arbitrary gauge groups and\nnumbers of quark flavours. An assumption about the running of the anomalous\ndimension of the quark bilinear operator is input and the model then predicts\nthe spectrum and decay constants for the mesons. We add NJL interactions\nresponsible for flavour physics from extended tecnhicolour, top-colour etc\nusing Witten's multi-trace prescription. We show the key behaviours of a top\ncondensation model can be reproduced. We study generation of the top mass in\n(walking) one doublet and one family technicolour models and with strong ETC\ninteractions. The models clearly reveal the tensions between the large top mass\nand precision data for delta rho. The neccessary tunings needed to generate a\nmodel compatible with precision constraints are simply demonstrated.\n", "  There is a long-standing experimental observation that the melting of\ntopologically constrained DNA, such as circular-closed plasmids, is less abrupt\nthan that of linear molecules. This finding points to an intriguing role of\ntopology in the physics of DNA denaturation, which is however poorly\nunderstood. Here, we shed light on this issue by combining large-scale Brownian\nDynamics simulations with an analytically solvable phenomenological Landau mean\nfield theory. We find that the competition between melting and supercoiling\nleads to phase coexistence of denatured and intact phases at the single\nmolecule level. This coexistence occurs in a wide temperature range, thereby\naccounting for the broadening of the transition. Finally, our simulations show\nan intriguing topology-dependent scaling law governing the growth of\ndenaturation bubbles in supercoiled plasmids, which can be understood within\nthe proposed mean field theory.\n", "  The factorization of amplitudes into hard, soft and collinear parts is known\nto be violated in situations where incoming particles are collinear to outgoing\nones. This result was first derived by studying limits where non-collinear\nparticles become collinear. We show that through an effective field theory\nframework with Glauber operators, these factorization-violating effects can be\nreproduced from an amplitude that is factorized before the splitting occurs. We\nconfirm results at one-loop, through single Glauber exchange, and at two-loops,\nthrough double Glauber exchange. To approach the calculation, we begin by\nreviewing the importance of Glauber scaling for factorization. We show that for\nany situation where initial state and final state particles are not collinear,\nthe Glauber contribution is entirely contained in the soft contribution. The\ncontributions coming from Glauber operators are necessarily non-analytic\nfunctions of external momentum, with the non-analyticity arising from the\nrapidity regulator. The non-analyticity is critical so that Glauber operators\ncan both preserve factorization when it holds and produce\nfactorization-violating effects when they are present.\n", "  In a wide range of complex networks, the links between the nodes are temporal\nand may sporadically appear and disappear. This temporality is fundamental to\nanalyze the formation of paths within such networks. Moreover, the presence of\nthe links between the nodes is a random process induced by nature in many\nreal-world networks. In this paper, we study random temporal networks at a\nmicroscopic level and formulate the \\emph{probability of accessibility} from a\nnode \\emph{i} to a node \\emph{j} after a certain number of discrete time units\n$T$. While solving the original problem is computationally intractable, we\nprovide an upper and two lower bounds on this probability for a very general\ncase with arbitrary time-varying probabilities of links' existence. Moreover,\nfor a special case where the links have identical probabilities across the\nnetwork at each time slot, we obtain the exact probability of accessibility\nbetween any two nodes. Finally, we discuss scenarios where the information\nregarding the presence and absence of links is initially available in the form\nof time duration (of presence or absence intervals) continuous probability\ndistributions rather than discrete probabilities over time slots. We provide a\nmethod for transforming such distributions to discrete probabilities which\nenables us to apply the given bounds in this paper to a broader range of\nproblem settings.\n", "  We consider two different conformal field theories with central charge\nc=7/10. One is the diagonal invariant minimal model in which all fields have\ninteger spins; the other is the local fermionic theory with superconformal\nsymmetry in which fields can have half-integer spin. We construct new conformal\n(but not topological or factorised) defects in the minimal model. We do this by\nfirst constructing defects in the fermionic model as boundary conditions in a\nfermionic theory of central charge c=7/5, using the folding trick as first\nproposed by Gang and Yamaguchi. We then acting on these with interface defects\nto find the new conformal defects. As part of the construction, we find the\ntopological defects in the fermionic theory and the interfaces between the\nfermionic theory and the minimal model. We also consider the simpler case of\ndefects in the theory of a single free fermion and interface defects between\nthe Ising model and a single fermion as a prelude to calculations in the\ntri-critical Ising model.\n", "  We investigate the many-body properties of graphene on top of a piezoelectric\nsubstrate, focusing on the interaction between the graphene electrons and the\npiezoelectric acoustic phonons. We calculate the electron and phonon\nself-energies as well as the electron mobility limited by the substrate\nphonons. We emphasize the importance of the proper screening of the\nelectron-phonon vertex and discuss the various limiting behaviors as a function\nof electron energy, temperature, and doping level. The effect on the graphene\nelectrons of the piezoelectric acoustic phonons is compared with that of the\nintrinsic deformation acoustic phonons of graphene. Substrate phonons tend to\ndominate over intrinsic ones for low doping levels at high and low\ntemperatures.\n", "  We show that for non-relativistic free particles, the (bosonic) many particle\nequations can be rewritten in geometric fashion in terms of a classical theory\nof conformally stretched spacetime. We further generalize the results for the\nparticles subject to a potential.\n", "  The efficient conversion of thermal energy to mechanical work by a heat\nengine is an ongoing technological challenge. Since the pioneering work of\nCarnot, it is known that the efficiency of heat engines is bounded by a\nfundamental upper limit, the Carnot limit. Theoretical studies suggest that\nheat engines may be operated beyond the Carnot limit by exploiting stationary,\nnon-equilibrium reservoirs that are characterized by a temperature as well as\nfurther parameters. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate that the\nefficiency of a nano-beam heat engine coupled to squeezed thermal noise is not\nbounded by the standard Carnot limit. Remarkably, we also show that it is\npossible to design a cyclic process that allows for extraction of mechanical\nwork from a single squeezed thermal reservoir. Our results demonstrate a\nqualitatively new regime of non-equilibrium thermodynamics at small scales and\nprovide a new perspective on the design of efficient, highly miniaturized\nengines.\n", "  Double Dirac fermions have recently been identified as possible\nquasiparticles hosted by three-dimensional crystals with particular\nnon-symmorphic point group symmetries. Applying a combined approach of\nab-initio methods and dynamical mean field theory, we investigate how\ninteractions and double Dirac band topology conspire to form the electronic\nquantum state of Bi$_2$CuO$_4$. We derive a downfolded eight-band model of the\npristine material at low energies around the Fermi level. By tuning the model\nparameters from the free band structure to the realistic strongly correlated\nregime, we find a persistence of the double Dirac dispersion until its\nconstituting time reveral symmetry is broken due to the onset of magnetic\nordering at the Mott transition. We analyze pressure as a promising route to\nrealize a double-Dirac metal in Bi$_2$CuO$_4$.\n", "  We set up a tree-level six point scattering process in which two strings are\nseparated longitudinally such that they could only interact directly via a\nnon-local spreading effect such as that predicted by light cone gauge\ncalculations and the Gross-Mende saddle point. One string, the `detector', is\nproduced at a finite time with energy $E$ by an auxiliary $2\\to 2$ sub-process,\nwith kinematics such that it has sufficient resolution to detect the\nlongitudinal spreading of an additional incoming string, the `source'. We test\nthis hypothesis in a gauge-invariant S-matrix calculation convolved with an\nappropriate wavepacket peaked at a separation $X$ between the central\ntrajectories of the source and produced detector. The amplitude exhibits\nsupport for scattering at the predicted longitudinal separation $X\\sim\\alpha'\nE$, in sharp contrast to the analogous quantum field theory amplitude (whose\nsupport manifestly traces out a tail of the position-space wavefunction). The\neffect arises in a regime in which the string amplitude is not obtained as a\nconvergent sum of such QFT amplitudes, and has larger amplitude than similar\nQFT models (with the same auxiliary four point amplitude). In a linear dilaton\nbackground, the amplitude depends on the string coupling as expected if the\nscattering is not simply occuring on the wavepacket tail in string theory. This\nmanifests the scale of longitudinal spreading in a gauge-invariant S-matrix\namplitude, in a calculable process with significant amplitude. It simulates a\nkey feature of the dynamics of time-translated horizon infallers.\n", "  Force-Free Electrodynamics (FFE) describes a particular regime of\nmagnetically dominated relativistic plasmas, which arises on several\nastrophysical scenarios of interest such as pulsars or active galactic nuclei.\nIn this article, we present a full 3D numerical implementation of the FFE\nevolution around a Kerr black hole. The novelty of our approach is\nthree-folded: i) We use the \"multi-block\" technique to represent a domain with\n$S^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$ topology within a stable finite-differences scheme.\nii) We employ as evolution equations those arising from a covariant\nhyperbolization of the FFE system. iii) We implement stable and\nconstraint-preserving boundary conditions to represent an outer region given by\na uniform magnetic field aligned or misaligned respect to the symmetry axis.\n  We find stationary jet solutions which reach equilibrium --through boundary\nconditions-- with the outer numerical surface. This is so, even when the outer\nboundary is located very close to the central region (i.e. $r_{out}\\sim 10M $).\nThese numerical solutions reproduce most of the known results for analogue\nastrophysical settings.\n", "  Recent spectropolarimetric observations of otherwise ordinary G, K, and M\ngiants revealed localized magnetic strips in the HRD coincident with the\nregions where the first dredge-up and core He-burning occur. We seek to\nunderstand the origin of magnetic fields in such late-type giant stars. In\nanalogy with late-type dwarf stars, we focus primarily on parameters known to\ninfluence the generation of magnetic fields in the outer convective envelope.\nWe compute the classical dynamo parameters along the evolutionary tracks of\nlow- and intermediate-mass stars at various metallicities using stellar models\nthat have been extensively tested by spectroscopic and asteroseismic\nobservations. These include convective turnover timescales and convective\nRossby numbers, computed from the PMS to the tip of the RGB or the early AGB.\nTo investigate the effects of the very extended outer convective envelope, we\ncompute these parameters both for the entire convective envelope and locally,\nthat is, at different depths within the envelope. We also compute the turnover\ntimescales and corresponding Rossby numbers for the convective cores of\nintermediate-mass stars on the main sequence.\n  Our models show that the Rossby number of the convective envelope becomes\nlower than unity in the well-delimited locations of the Hertzsprung-Russell\ndiagram where magnetic fields have indeed been detected. We show that\nalpha-omega dynamo processes might not be continuously operating, but that they\nare favored in the stellar convective envelope at two specific moments along\nthe evolution tracks, that is, during the first dredge-up at the base of the\nRGB and during central helium burning in the helium-burning phase and\nearly-AGB. This general behavior can explain the so-called magnetic strips\nrecently discovered by dedicated spectropolarimetric surveys of evolved stars.\n", "  We revisit the decoupling effects associated with heavy particles in the\nrenormalization group running of the vacuum energy in a mass-dependent\nrenormalization scheme. We find the running of the vacuum energy stemming from\nthe Higgs condensate in the entire energy range and show that it behaves as\nexpected from the simple dimensional arguments meaning that it exhibits the\nquadratic sensitivity to the mass of the heavy particles in the infrared\nregime. The consequence of such a running to the fine-tuning problem with the\nmeasured value of the Cosmological Constant is analyzed and the constraint on\nthe mass spectrum of a given model is derived. We show that in the Standard\nModel (SM) this fine-tuning constraint is not satisfied while in the massless\ntheories this constraint formally coincides with the well known Veltman\ncondition. We also provide a remarkably simple extension of the SM where\nsaturation of this constraint enables us to predict the radiative Higgs mass\ncorrectly. Generalization to constant curvature spaces is also given.\n", "  The Be/X-ray transient 4U 0115+63 exhibited a giant, type-II outburst in\nOctober 2015. The source did not decay to its quiescent state but settled in a\nmeta-stable plateau state (a factor ~10 brighter than quiescence) in which its\nluminosity slowly decayed. We used XMM-Newton to observe the system during this\nphase and we found that its spectrum can be well described using a black-body\nmodel with a small emitting radius. This suggests emission from hot spots on\nthe surface, which is confirmed by the detection of pulsations. In addition, we\nobtained a relatively long (~7.9 ksec) Swift/XRT observation ~35 days after our\nXMM-Newton one. We found that the source luminosity was significantly higher\nand, although the spectrum could be fitted with a black-body model the\ntemperature was higher and the emitting radius smaller. Several weeks later the\nsystem started a sequence of type-I accretion outbursts. In between those\noutbursts, the source was marginally detected with a luminosity consistent with\nits quiescent level. We discuss our results in the context of the three\nproposed scenarios (accretion down to the magnestospheric boundary, direct\naccretion onto neutron star magnetic poles or cooling of the neutron star\ncrust) to explain the plateau phase.\n", "  Applications of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light range from the\nnext generation of optical communication systems to optical imaging and optical\nmanipulation of particles. Here we propose a micron-sized semiconductor source\nwhich emits light with pre-defined OAM components. This source is based on a\npolaritonic quantum fluid. We show how in this system modulational\ninstabilities can be controlled and harnessed for the spontaneous formation of\nOAM components not present in the pump laser source. Once created, the OAM\nstates exhibit exotic flow patterns in the quantum fluid, characterized by\ngeneration-annihilation pairs. These can only occur in open systems, not in\nequilibrium condensates, in contrast to well-established vortex-antivortex\npairs.\n", "  We study the propagation of massless fermionic fields in the background of a\nthree-dimensional Lifshitz black hole, which is a solution of conformal\ngravity. The black hole solution is characterized by a null dynamical exponent.\nThen, we compute analytically the quasinormal modes, the area spectrum, and the\nabsorption cross section for fermionic fields. The analysis of the quasinormal\nmodes shows that the fermionic perturbations are stable in this background. The\narea and entropy spectrum are evenly spaced. At the low frequency limit, it is\nobserved that there is a range of values of the angular momentum of the mode\nthat contributes to the absorption cross section, whereas it vanishes at the\nhigh frequency limit. In addition, by a suitable change of variables a\ngravitational soliton can also be obtained and the stability of the quasinormal\nmodes are studied and ensured.\n", "  The first measurement of transverse-spin-dependent azimuthal asymmetries in\nthe pion-induced Drell-Yan (DY) process is reported. We use the CERN SPS 190\nGeV/$c$, $\\pi^{-}$ beam and a transversely polarized ammonia target. Three\nazimuthal asymmetries giving access to different transverse-momentum-dependent\n(TMD) parton distribution functions (PDFs) are extracted using dimuon events\nwith invariant mass between 4.3 GeV/$c^2$ and 8.5 GeV/$c^2$. The observed sign\nof the Sivers asymmetry is found to be consistent with the fundamental\nprediction of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) that the Sivers TMD PDFs extracted\nfrom DY have a sign opposite to the one extracted from semi-inclusive\ndeep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) data. We present two other asymmetries\noriginating from the pion Boer-Mulders TMD PDFs convoluted with either the\nnucleon transversity or pretzelosity TMD PDFs. These DY results are obtained at\na hard scale comparable to that of a recent COMPASS SIDIS measurement and hence\nallow unique tests of fundamental QCD universality predictions.\n", "  We examine the dynamics associated with weakly compressible convection in a\nspherical shell by running 3D direct numerical simulations using the Boussinesq\nformalism [1]. Motivated by problems in astrophysics, we assume the existence\nof a finite adiabatic temperature gradient $\\nabla T_{\\rm{ad}}$ and use mixed\nboundary conditions for the temperature with fixed flux at the inner boundary\nand fixed temperature at the outer boundary. This setup is intrinsically more\nasymmetric than the more standard case of Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection in\nliquids between parallel plates with fixed temperature boundary conditions.\nConditions where there is substantial asymmetry can cause a dramatic change in\nthe nature of convection and we demonstrate that this is the case here. The\nflows can become pressure- rather than buoyancy- dominated leading to anomalous\nheat transport by upflows. Counter-intuitively, the background temperature\ngradient $\\nabla\\bar{T}$ can develop a subadiabatic layer (where\n$\\boldsymbol{g}\\cdot\\nabla\\bar{T}<\\boldsymbol{g}\\cdot\\nabla T_{\\rm{ad}}$, where\n$\\boldsymbol{g}$ is gravity) although convection remains vigorous at every\npoint across the shell. This indicates a high degree of non-locality.\n", "  The role of relativistic corrections in Coulomb scattering of heavy ions at\nintermediate energy collisions ($E_{lab}\\gtrsim 50$ MeV/n) is investigated by\nnumerically solving a full set of coupled equations. We compare two methods,\n(a) one involving an exact account of interaction retardation with (b) a method\nbased on the expansion of effective Lagrangians in powers of the ion\nvelocities, $v/c$.Our study makes it possible to infer the relevance of\nkinematic corrections, retardation, and magnetic interactions such as the\nDarwin force. We show that analytical formulas are able to describe all aspects\nof experimental interest in relativistic effects in heavy-ion Coulomb\nscattering at intermediate energies without having to solve numerically the\ncoupled equations.\n", "  We study the production of primordial circular (\"V-mode\") polarization in\naxion inflation coupled to fermions and gauge fields, with special attention\npaid to (p)reheating. We construct the power spectrum of $V$, and find a\nblue-tilted spectrum with index $n_V=4$. This is independent of the dominant\ndecay channel of the inflaton (direct fermion vs. direct photon production)\n", "  Equations of motion of low-energy string effective actions can be\nconveniently described in terms of generalized geometry and Levi-Civita\nconnections on Courant algebroids. This approach is used to propose and prove a\nsuitable version of the Kaluza-Klein-like reduction. Necessary geometrical\ntools are recalled.\n", "  We have observed that C$_{60}^+$ ions isolated in cryogenic matrixes show\npronounced near-IR photoluminescence upon excitation in the near-IR range. By\ncontrast UV photoexcitation does not lead to measurable luminescence. After the\nrecent unequivocal assignment of five Diffuse Interstellar Bands to near-IR\nabsorption bands of C$_{60}^+$, we propose to search also for C$_{60}^+$\nnear-IR emission in those astronomical objects, where fullerenes have been\nalready detected or may be potentially present.\n", "  Early-time observations of the Type II supernovae (SNe) 2013cu and 2013fs\nhave revealed an interaction of ejecta with material near the star surface.\nUnlike the Type IIn SN2010jl, which interacts with a dense wind for ~1yr, the\ninteraction ebbs after 2-3d, suggesting a dense and compact circumstellar\nenvelope. Here, we use multi-group radiation-hydrodynamics and\nnon-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer to explore the\nproperties of red supergiant (RSG) star explosions embedded in a variety of\ndense envelopes. We consider the cases of an extended static atmosphere or a\nsteady-state wind, adopting a range of mass loss rates. The shock-breakout\nsignal, the SN radiation up to 10d, and the ejecta dynamics are strongly\ninfluenced by the properties of this nearby environment. This compromises the\nuse of early-time observations to constrain Rstar. The presence of narrow lines\nfor 2-3d in 2013fs and 2013cu require a cocoon of material of ~0.01Msun out to\n5-10Rstar. Spectral lines evolve from electron-scattering to Doppler broadened,\nwith a growing blueshift of their emission peaks. Recent studies propose a\nsuper-wind phase with a mass loss rate from 0.001 up to 1Msun/yr in the last\nmonths/years of the RSG life, although there is no observational constraint\nthat this external material is a steady-state outflow. Alternatively,\nobservations may be explained by the explosion of a RSG star inside its complex\natmosphere. Indeed, spatially resolved observations reveal that RSG stars have\nextended atmospheres, with the presence of downflows and upflows out to several\nRstar, even in a standard RSG like Betelgeuse. Mass loading in the region\nintermediate between star and wind can accommodate the 0.01Msun needed to\nexplain the observations of 2013fs. A puzzling super-wind phase prior to\ncore-collapse may be therefore superfluous [Abridged].\n", "  Epitaxial CoFe2O4/Al2O3 bilayers are expected to be highly efficient spin\ninjectors into Si owing to the spin filter effect of CoFe2O4. To exploit the\nfull potential of this system, understanding the microscopic origin of\nmagnetically dead layers at the CoFe2O4/Al2O3 interface is necessary. In this\npaper, we study the crystallographic and electronic structures and the magnetic\nproperties of CoFe2O4(111) layers with various thicknesses (thickness d = 1.4,\n2.3, 4, and 11 nm) in the epitaxial CoFe2O4(111)/Al2O3(111)/Si(111) structures\nusing soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism (XMCD) combined with cluster-model calculation. The magnetization of\nCoFe2O4 measured by XMCD gradually decreases with decreasing thickness d and\nfinally a magnetically dead layer is clearly detected at d = 1.4 nm. The\nmagnetically dead layer has frustration of magnetic interactions which is\nrevealed from comparison between the magnetizations at 300 and 6 K. From\nanalysis using configuration-interaction cluster-model calculation, the\ndecrease of d leads to a decrease in the inverse-to-normal spinel structure\nratio and also a decrease in the average valence of Fe at the octahedral sites.\nThese results strongly indicate that the magnetically dead layer at the\nCoFe2O4/Al2O3 interface originates from various complex networks of\nsuperexchange interactions through the change in the crystallographic and\nelectronic structures. Furthermore, from comparison of the magnetic properties\nbetween d = 1.4 and 2.3 nm, it is found that ferrimagnetic order of the\nmagnetically dead layer at d = 1.4 nm is restored by the additional growth of\nthe 0.9-nm-thick CoFe2O4 layer on it.\n", "  We establish a general operational one-to-one mapping between coherence\nmeasures and entanglement measures: Any entanglement measure of bipartite pure\nstates is the minimum of a suitable coherence measure over product bases. Any\ncoherence measure of pure states, with extension to mixed states by convex\nroof, is the maximum entanglement generated by incoherent operations acting on\nthe system and an incoherent ancilla. Remarkably, the generalized CNOT gate is\nthe universal optimal incoherent operation. In this way, all convex-roof\ncoherence measures, including the coherence of formation, are endowed with\n(additional) operational interpretations. By virtue of this connection, many\nresults on entanglement can be translated to the coherence setting, and vice\nversa. As applications, we provide tight observable lower bounds for\ngeneralized entanglement concurrence and coherence concurrence, which enable\nexperimentalists to quantify entanglement and coherence of the maximal\ndimension in real experiments.\n", "  We map the quantum entanglement problem onto the mathematically well-studied\ntruncated moment problem. This yields a necessary and sufficient condition for\nseparability that can be checked by a hierarchy of semi-definite programs. The\nalgorithm always gives a certificate of entanglement if the state is entangled.\nIf the state is separable, typically a certificate of separability is obtained\nin a finite number of steps and an explicit decomposition into separable pure\nstates can be extracted.\n", "  Precision study of electroweak symmetry breaking strongly motivates the\nconstruction of a lepton collider with center-of-mass energy of at least 240\nGeV. Besides Higgsstrahlung ($e^+e^- \\to hZ$), such a collider would measure\nweak boson pair production ($e^+e^- \\to WW$) with an astonishing precision. The\nweak-boson-fusion production process ($e^+e^- \\to \\nu \\bar{\\nu} h$) provides an\nincreasingly powerful handle at higher center-of-mass energies. High energies\nalso benefit the associated top-Higgs production ($e^+e^-\\to t\\bar th$) that is\ncrucial to constrain directly the top Yukawa coupling. The impact and\ncomplementarity of differential measurements, at different center-of-mass\nenergies and for several beam polarization configurations, are studied in a\nglobal effective-field-theory framework. We define a \"global determinant\nparameter\" (GDP) which characterizes the overall strengthening of constraints\nindependently of the choice of operator basis. The reach of the CEPC, CLIC,\nFCC-ee, and ILC designs is assessed.\n", "  Earth is the only planet known to harbor life, therefore we may speculate on\nhow the nature of the Sun-Earth interaction is relevant to life on Earth, and\nhow the behavior of other stars may influence the development of life on their\nplanetary systems. We study the long-term variability of a sample of five solar\nanalog stars using composite chromospheric activity records up to 50 years in\nlength and synoptic visible-band photometry about 20 years long. This sample\ncovers a large range of stellar ages which we use to represent the evolution in\nactivity for solar mass stars. We find that young, fast rotators have an\namplitude of variability many times that of the solar cycle, while old, slow\nrotators have very little variability. We discuss the possible impacts of this\nvariability on young Earth and exoplanet climates.\n", "  We present interferometric CO observations made with the Combined Array for\nMillimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) of galaxies from the Extragalactic Database\nfor Galaxy Evolution survey (EDGE). These galaxies are selected from the Calar\nAlto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) sample, mapped with optical integral\nfield spectroscopy. EDGE provides good quality CO data (3$\\sigma$ sensitivity\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm mol}$ $\\sim$ 11 M$_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ before inclination correction,\nresolution $\\sim1.4$ kpc) for 126 galaxies, constituting the largest\ninterferometric CO survey of galaxies in the nearby universe. We describe the\nsurvey, the data characteristics, the data products, and present initial\nscience results. We find that the exponential scale-lengths of the molecular,\nstellar, and star-forming disks are approximately equal, and galaxies that are\nmore compact in molecular gas than in stars tend to show signs of interaction.\nWe characterize the molecular to stellar ratio as a function of Hubble type and\nstellar mass, present preliminary results on the resolved relations between the\nmolecular gas, stars, and star formation rate, and discuss the dependence of\nthe resolved molecular depletion time on stellar surface density, nebular\nextinction, and gas metallicity. EDGE provides a key dataset to address\noutstanding topics regarding gas and its role in star formation and galaxy\nevolution, which will be publicly available on completion of the quality\nassessment.\n", "  We analyze tree-level string amplitudes in a linear dilaton background,\nmotivated by its use as a gauge-invariant tracer of string interactions in\nscattering experiments and its genericity among simple perturbative string\ntheory limits. A simple case is given by a lightlike dependence for the\ndilaton. The zero mode of the embedding coordinate in the direction of dilaton\nvariation requires special care. Employing Gaussian wave packets and a\nwell-defined modification of the dilaton profile far from the dominant\ninteraction region, we obtain finite results which explicitly reproduce the\ninteraction timescales expected from joining and splitting interactions\ninvolving oscillating strings in simple string scattering processes. There is\nan interesting interplay between the effects of the linear dilaton and the\n$i\\epsilon$ prescription. In more general circumstances this provides a method\nfor tracing the degree of non-locality in string interactions, and it gives a\nbasis for further studies of perturbative supercritical string theory at higher\nloop order.\n", "  We detected flaring flux variability that regularly occurred with the period\nof 23.9 days on a 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission at Vlsr = 25.30 km/s in G\n014.23-00.50 through highly frequent monitoring using the Hitachi 32-m radio\ntelescope. By analyzing data from 05 January 2013 to 21 January 2016, the\nperiodic variability has persisted in at least 47 cycles, corresponding to\napproximately 1,100 days. The period of 23.9 days is the shortest one observed\nin masers at around high-mass young stellar objects so far. The flaring\ncomponent normally falls below the detection limit (3 sigma) of 0.9 Jy. In the\nflaring periods, the component rises above the detection limit with the ratio\nof the peak flux density more than 180 in comparison with a quiescent phase,\nshowing intermittent periodic variability. The time-scale of the flux rise was\ntypically two days or shorter, and both symmetric and asymmetric profiles of\nflux variability were observed through intraday monitoring. These\ncharacteristics might be explained by a change in the flux of seed photons by a\ncolliding-wind binary (CWB) system or a variation of the dust temperature by an\nextra heating source of a shock formed by the CWB system within a gap region in\na circumbinary disk, in which the orbital semi-major axes of the binary are\n0.26-0.34 au.\n", "  We derive a monogamy inequality for any local quantum resource and\nentanglement. It results from the fact that there is always a convex measure\nfor a quantum resource, as shown here, and from the relation between\nentanglement and local entropy. One of its consequences is an entanglement\nmonogamy different from that usually discussed. If the local resource is\nnonuniformity or coherence, it is satisfied by familiar resource and\nentanglement measures. The ensuing upper bound for the local coherence,\ndetermined by the entanglement, is independent of the basis used to define the\ncoherence.\n", "  The Seebeck coefficient $S$ of the cuprate YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{y}$ was\nmeasured in magnetic fields large enough to suppress superconductivity, at hole\ndopings $p = 0.11$ and $p = 0.12$, for heat currents along the $a$ and $b$\ndirections of the orthorhombic crystal structure. For both directions, $S/T$\ndecreases and becomes negative at low temperature, a signature that the Fermi\nsurface undergoes a reconstruction due to broken translational symmetry. Above\na clear threshold field, a strong new feature appears in $S_{\\rm b}$, for\nconduction along the $b$ axis only. We attribute this feature to the onset of\n3D-coherent unidirectional charge-density-wave modulations seen by x-ray\ndiffraction, also along the $b$ axis only. Because these modulations have a\nsharp onset temperature well below the temperature where $S/T$ starts to drop\ntowards negative values, we infer that they are not the cause of Fermi-surface\nreconstruction. Instead, the reconstruction must be caused by the quasi-2D\nbidirectional modulations that develop at significantly higher temperature.\n", "  The chromosphere is a complex region that acts as an intermediary between the\nmagnetic flux emergence in the photosphere and the magnetic features seen in\nthe corona. Large eruptions in the chromosphere of flares and filaments are\noften accompanied by ejections of coronal mass off the sun. Several studies\nhave observed fast-moving progressive trains of compact bright points (called\nSequential Chromospheric Brightenings or SCBs) streaming away from\nchromospheric flares that also produce a coronal mass ejection (CME). In this\nwork, we review studies of SCBs and search for commonalties between them. We\nplace these findings into a larger context with contemporary chromospheric and\ncoronal observations. SCBs are fleeting indicators of the solar atmospheric\nenvironment as it existed before their associated eruption. Since they appear\nat the very outset of a flare eruption, SCBs are good early indication of a CME\nmeasured in the chromosphere.\n", "  A lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) with enhanced stability and accuracy is\npresented for various Hermite tensor-based lattice structures. The collision\noperator relies on a regularization step, which is here improved through a\nrecursive computation of non-equilibrium Hermite polynomial coefficients. In\naddition to the reduced computational cost of this procedure with respect to\nthe standard one, the recursive step allows to considerably enhance the\nstability and accuracy of the numerical scheme by properly filtering out second\n(and higher) order non-hydrodynamic contributions in under-resolved conditions.\nThis is first shown in the isothermal case where the simulation of the doubly\nperiodic shear layer is performed with a Reynolds number ranging from $10^4$ to\n$10^6$, and where a thorough analysis of the case at $Re=3\\times 10^4$ is\nconducted. In the latter, results obtained using both regularization steps are\ncompared against the BGK-LBM for standard (D2Q9) and high-order (D2V17 and\nD2V37) lattice structures, confirming the tremendous increase of stability\nrange of the proposed approach. Further comparisons on thermal and fully\ncompressible flows, using the general extension of this procedure, are then\nconducted through the numerical simulation of Sod shock tubes with the D2V37\nlattice. They confirm the stability increase induced by the recursive approach\nas compared with the standard one.\n", "  We propose a new type of Hopf semimetals indexed by a pair of numbers\n$(p,q)$, where the Hopf number is given by $pq$. The Fermi surface is given by\nthe preimage of the Hopf map, which is nontrivially linked for a nonzero Hopf\nnumber. The Fermi surface forms a torus link, whose examples are the Hopf link\nindexed by $(1,1)$, the Solomon's knot $(2,1)$, the double Hopf-link $(2,2)$\nand the double trefoil-knot $(3,2)$. We may choose $p$ or $q$ as a half\ninteger, where torus-knot Fermi surfaces such as the trefoil knot $(3/2,1)$ are\nrealized. It is even possible to make the Hopf number an arbitrary rational\nnumber, where a semimetal whose Fermi surface forms open strings is generated.\n", "  The goal of the OSIRIS-REx mission is to return a sample of asteroid material\nfrom Near-Earth Asteroid (101955) Bennu. The role of the navigation and flight\ndynamics team is critical for the spacecraft to execute a precisely planned\nsampling maneuver over a specifically-selected landing site. In particular, the\norientation of Bennu needs to be recovered with good accuracy during orbital\noperations to contribute as small an error as possible to the landing error\nbudget. Although Bennu is well characterized from Earth-based radar\nobservations, its orientation dynamics are not sufficiently known to exclude\nthe presence of a small wobble. To better understand this contingency and\nevaluate how well the orientation can be recovered in the presence of a large\n1$^{\\circ}$ wobble, we conduct a comprehensive simulation with the NASA GSFC\nGEODYN orbit determination and geodetic parameter estimation software. We\ndescribe the dynamic orientation modeling implemented in GEODYN in support of\nOSIRIS-REx operations, and show how both altimetry and imagery data can be used\nas either undifferenced (landmark, direct altimetry) or differenced (image\ncrossover, altimetry crossover) measurements. We find that these two different\ntypes of data contribute differently to the recovery of instrument pointing or\nplanetary orientation. When upweighted, the absolute measurements help reduce\nthe geolocation errors, despite poorer astrometric (inertial) performance. We\nfind that with no wobble present, all the geolocation requirements are met.\nWhile the presence of a large wobble is detrimental, the recovery is still\nreliable thanks to the combined use of altimetry and imagery data.\n", "  Direct detection of regions of ionized hydrogen (HII) has been suggested as a\npromising probe of cosmic reionization. Observing the redshifted 21-cm signal\nof hydrogen from the epoch of reionization (EoR) is a key scientific driver\nbehind new-generation, low-frequency radio interferometers. We investigate the\nfeasibility of combining low-frequency observations with the Square Kilometre\nArray and near infra-red survey data of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey\nTelescope to detect cosmic reionization by imaging HII bubbles surrounding\nmassive galaxies during the cosmic dawn. While individual bubbles will be too\nsmall to be detected, we find that by stacking redshifted 21-cm spectra centred\non known galaxies, it will be possible to directly detect the EoR at $z \\sim\n9-12$, and to place qualitative constraints on the evolution of the spin\ntemperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $z \\geq 9$. In particular,\ngiven a detection of ionized bubbles using this technique, it is possible to\ndetermine if the IGM surrounding them is typically in absorption or emission.\nDetermining the globally-averaged neutral fraction of the IGM using this method\nwill prove more difficult due to degeneracy with the average size of HII\nregions.\n", "  The mechanical failure of amorphous media is a ubiquitous phenomenon from\nmaterial engineering to geology. It has been noticed for a long time that the\nphenomenon is \"scale-free\", indicating some type of criticality. In spite of\nattempts to invoke \"Self-Organized Criticality\", the physical origin of this\ncriticality, and also its universal nature, being quite insensitive to the\nnature of microscopic interactions, remained elusive. Recently we proposed that\nthe precise nature of this critical behavior is manifested by a spinodal point\nof a thermodynamic phase transition. Moreover, at the spinodal point there\nexists a divergent correlation length which is associated with the\nsystem-spanning instabilities (known also as shear bands) which are typical to\nthe mechanical yield. Demonstrating this requires the introduction of an \"order\nparameter\" that is suitable for distinguishing between disordered amorphous\nsystems, and an associated correlation function, suitable for picking up the\ngrowing correlation length. The theory, the order parameter, and the\ncorrelation functions used are universal in nature and can be applied to any\namorphous solid that undergoes mechanical yield. Critical exponents for the\ncorrelation length divergence and the system size dependence are estimated. The\nphenomenon is seen at its sharpest in athermal systems, as is explained below;\nin this paper we extend the discussion also to thermal systems, showing that at\nsufficiently high temperatures the spinodal phenomenon is destroyed by thermal\nfluctuations.\n", "  Since the first discovery of a broad-lined type Ic supernova (SN) with a\nlong-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) in 1998, fewer than fifty gamma-ray burst\nsupernovae (GRB-SNe) have been discovered. The intermediate-luminosity Swift\nGRB 161219B and its associated supernova SN 2016jca, which occurred at a\nredshift of z=0.1475, represents only the seventh GRB-SN to have been\ndiscovered within 1 Gpc, and hence provides an excellent opportunity to\ninvestigate the observational and physical properties of these very elusive and\nrare type of SN. As such, we present optical to near-infrared photometry and\noptical spectroscopy of GRB 161219B and SN 2016jca, spanning the first three\nmonths since its discovery. GRB 161219B exploded in the disk of an edge-on\nspiral galaxy at a projected distance of 3.4 kpc from the galactic centre. GRB\n161219B itself is an outlier of the Amati relation, while SN 2016jca had a\nrest-frame, peak absolute V-band magnitude of M_V = -19.0, which it reached\nafter 12.5 rest-frame days. We find that the bolometric properties of SN\n2016jca are inconsistent with being powered solely by a magnetar central\nengine, as proposed by other authors, and demonstrate that it was likely\npowered exclusively by energy deposited by the radioactive decay of nickel and\ncobalt into their daughter products, which were nucleosynthesized when its\nprogenitor underwent core collapse. We find that 0.22 solar masses of nickel is\nrequired to reproduce the peak luminosity of SN 2016jca, and we constrain an\nejecta mass of 5.8 solar masses and a kinetic energy of ~5 x 10^52 erg.\nFinally, we report on a chromatic, pre-maximum bump in the g-band light curve,\nand discuss its possible origin. [Abridged]\n", "  The nonleptonic weak decay of $\\Lambda^+_c \\to \\bar{K}^0 \\eta p$ is analyzed\nfrom the viewpoint of probing the $N^*(1535)$ resonance, which has a big decay\nbranching ratio to $\\eta N$. Up to an arbitrary normalization, the invariant\nmass distribution of $\\eta p$ is calculated with both the chiral unitary\napproach and an effective Lagrangian model. Within the chiral unitary approach,\nthe $N^*(1535)$ resonance is dynamically generated from the final state\ninteraction of mesons and baryons in the strangeness zero sector. For the\neffective Lagrangian model, we take a Breit-Wigner formula to describe the\ndistribution of the $N^*(1535)$ resonance. It is found that the behavior of the\n$N^*(1535)$ resonance in the $\\Lambda^+_c \\to \\bar{K}^0 N^*(1535) \\to \\bar{K}^0\n\\eta p$ decay within the two approaches is different. The proposed\n$\\Lambda^+_c$ decay mechanism can provide valuable information on the\nproperties of the $N^*(1535)$ and can in principle be tested by facilities such\nas BEPC II and SuperKEKB.\n", "  Recent LHCb data for time-dependent CP violation in $B_d^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-$\nand $B^0_s\\to K^+K^-$ show deviations from theoretical predictions. Besides\ntheir central values for $\\mathcal C_{K^+K^-}$, $\\mathcal S_{K^+K^-}$ and\n$\\mathcal A^{\\Delta \\Gamma}_{K^+K^-}$ violate quantum mechanic CPT invariant\nsum rule (CPT sum rule) prediction of $|\\mathcal C_{K^+K^-}|^2 + |\\mathcal\nS_{K^+K^-}| ^2 + |\\mathcal A^{\\Delta \\Gamma}_{K^+K^-}|^2 = 1$ (LHCb data imply\nthe sum to be $0.67\\pm 0.20$.), their values for $\\mathcal C_{K^+ K^-}= 0.24\\pm\n0.06\\pm {0.02}$ and $\\mathcal C_{\\pi^+ \\pi^-} = - 0.24\\pm 0.07\\pm 0.01$ also\nshow large violation of SU(3) or its U-spin sub-group symmetry (SU(3)/U)\nrelation $\\mathcal C_{K^+ K^-} /\\mathcal C_{\\pi^- \\pi^+} = - \\mathcal B(B_d^0\n\\to \\pi^- \\pi^+)\\tau_{B^0_s}/\\mathcal B(B^0_s \\to K^+ K^-)\\tau_{B_d^0}$ (LHCb\ndata imply the ratio of left-side to right-side to be $4.67\\pm 1.88$.) . The\nLHCb results need to be further confirmed to be taken seriously. We suggest to\nuse time-dependent CP violation in $B_s\\to K^0\\bar K^0, \\pi^+\\pi^-, \\pi^0\\pi^0$\nto further test the CPT sum rule. Assuming that the sum rule holds, we propose\nthat violation of the SU(3)/U relation may indicate a large FSI phase\ndifference in the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $K^+K^-$ re-scattering. We suggest several\nother U-spin pairs of $B\\to PP$ decays to further test SU(3)/U relations.\n", "  We present a realistic numerical model of sunspot and active region formation\nbased on the emergence of flux bundles generated in a solar convective dynamo.\nTo this end we use the magnetic and velocity fields in a horizontal layer near\nthe top boundary of the solar convective dynamo simulation to drive realistic\nradiative-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the upper most layers of the\nconvection zone. The main results are: (1) The emerging flux bundles rise with\nthe mean speed of convective upflows, and fragment into small-scale magnetic\nelements that further rise to the photosphere, where bipolar sunspot pairs are\nformed through the coalescence of the small-scale magnetic elements. (2)\nFilamentary penumbral structures form when the sunspot is still growing through\nongoing flux emergence. In contrast to the classical Evershed effect, the\ninflow seems to prevail over the outflow in a large part of the penumbra. (3) A\nwell formed sunspot is a mostly monolithic magnetic structures that is anchored\nin a persistent deep-seated downdraft lane. The flow field outside the spot\nshows a giant vortex ring that comprises of an inflow below 15 Mm depth and an\noutflow above 15 Mm depth. (4) The sunspots successfully reproduce the\nfundamental properties of the observed solar active regions, including the more\ncoherent leading spots with a stronger field strength, and the correct tilts of\nbipolar sunspot pairs. These asymmetries can be linked to the intrinsic\nasymmetries in the magnetic and flow fields adapted from the convective dynamo\nsimulation.\n", "  We studied the multi-plateau high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from solids\nnumerically. It is found that the HHG spectrum in the second or higher plateau\nis redshifted in short laser pulses due to the nonadiabatic effect. The\ncorresponding FWHMs also increase, suggesting the step-by-step excitation\nprocess of higher conduction bands in the HHG process. Even order harmonics in\nthe higher plateaus of HHG are present due to the break of symmetry in the k\nspace. It may stimulate related experimental work.\n", "  Nuclear spiral arms are small-scale transient spiral structures found in the\ncenters of galaxies. Similarly to their galactic-scale counterparts, nuclear\nspiral arms can perturb the orbits of stars. In the case of the Galactic Center\n(GC), these perturbations can affect the orbits of stars and binaries in a\nregion extending to several hundred parsecs around the supermassive black hole\n(MBH), causing diffusion in orbital energy and angular momentum. This diffusion\nprocess can drive stars and binaries to close approaches with the MBH,\ndisrupting single stars in tidal disruption events (TDEs), or disrupting\nbinaries, leaving a star tightly bound to the MBH, and an unbound star escaping\nthe galaxy, i.e., a hypervelocity star (HVS). Here, we consider diffusion by\nnuclear spiral arms in galactic nuclei, specifying to the Milky Way GC. We\ndetermine nuclear spiral arm-driven diffusion rates using test-particle\nintegrations, and compute disruption rates. Our TDE rates are up to 20% higher\ncompared to relaxation by single stars. For binaries, the enhancement is up to\na factor of ~100, and our rates are comparable to the observed numbers of HVSs\nand S-stars. Our scenario is complementary to relaxation driven by massive\nperturbers. In addition, our rates depend on the inclination of the binary with\nrespect to the Galactic plane. Therefore, our scenario provides a novel\npotential source for the observed anisotropic distribution of HVSs. Nuclear\nspiral arms may also be important for accelerating the coalescence of binary\nMBHs, and for supplying nuclear star clusters with stars and gas.\n", "  We classify all possible gap-closing procedures which can be achieved in\ntwo-dimensional time-reversal invariant noncentrosymmetric systems. For\nexhaustive classification, we examine the space group symmetries of all 49\nlayer groups lacking inversion taking into account spin-orbit coupling.\nAlthough a direct transition between two insulators is generally predicted to\noccur when a band crossing happens at a general point in the Brillouin zone, we\nfind that a variety of stable semimetal phases with point or line nodes can\nalso arise due to the band crossing in the presence of additional crystalline\nsymmetries. Through our theoretical study, we provide, for the first time, the\ncomplete list of nodal semimetals created by a band inversion in\ntwo-dimensional noncentrosymmetric systems with time-reversal invariance. The\ntransition from an insulator to a nodal semimetal can be grouped into three\nclasses depending on the crystalline symmetry. Firstly, in systems with a\ntwo-fold rotation about the z-axis (normal to the system), a band inversion at\na generic point generates a two-dimensional Weyl semimetal with point nodes.\nSecondly, when the band crossing happens on the line invariant under a two-fold\nrotation (mirror) symmetry with the rotation (normal) axis lying in the\ntwo-dimensional plane, a Weyl semimetal with point nodes can also be obtained.\nFinally, when the system has a mirror symmetry about the plane embracing the\nwhole system, a semimetal with nodal lines can be created. Applying our\ntheoretical framework, we identify various two-dimensional materials as\ncandidate systems in which stable nodal semimetal phases can be induced via\ndoping, applying electric field, or strain-engineering, etc.\n", "  High-pressure neutron powder diffraction, muon-spin rotation and\nmagnetization studies of the structural, magnetic and the superconducting\nproperties of the Ce-underdoped superconducting (SC) electron-doped cuprate\nsystem T'-Pr_1.3-xLa_0.7Ce_xCuO_4 with x = 0.1 are reported. A strong reduction\nof the lattice constants a and c is observed under pressure. However, no\nindication of any pressure induced phase transition from T' to T structure is\nobserved up to the maximum applied pressure of p = 11 GPa. Large and non-linear\nincrease of the short-range magnetic order temperature T_so in\nT'-Pr_1.3-xLa_0.7Ce_xCuO_4 (x = 0.1) was observed under pressure.\nSimultaneously pressure causes a non-linear decrease of the SC transition\ntemperature T_c. All these experiments establish the short-range magnetic order\nas an intrinsic and a new competing phase in SC T'-Pr_1.2La_0.7Ce_0.1CuO_4. The\nobserved pressure effects may be interpreted in terms of the improved nesting\nconditions through the reduction of the in-plane and out-of-plane lattice\nconstants upon hydrostatic pressure.\n", "  We present a one-dimensional numerical model based on elastically coupled\nsliders on a frictional incline of variable tilt. This very simple approach\nmakes possible to study the precursors to the avalanche and to provide a\nrationalization of different features that have been observed in experiments.\nWe provide a statistical description of the model leading to master equations\ndescribing the state of the system as a function of the angle of inclination.\nOur central results are the reproduction of large-scale regular events\npreceding the avalanche, on the one hand, and an analytical approach providing\nan internal threshold for the outbreak of rearrangements before the avalanche\nin the system, on the other hand.\n", "  We demonstrate the applicability of the EPR entanglement squeezing scheme for\nenhancing the shot-noise-limited sensitivity of a detuned dual-recycled\nMichelson interferometers. In particular, this scheme is applied to the\nGEO\\,600 interferometer. The effect of losses throughout the interferometer,\narm length asymmetries, and imperfect separation of the signal and idler beams\nare considered.\n", "  We show that the spectrum of the SYK model can be interpreted as that of a 3D\nscalar coupled to gravity. The scalar has a mass which is at the\nBreitenholer-Freedman bound of AdS$_2$, and subject to a delta function\npotential at the center of the interval along the third direction. This,\nthrough Kaluza-Klein procedure on AdS$_2 \\times (S^1)/Z_2$, generates the\nspectrum reproducing the bi-local propagator at strong coupling. Furthermore,\nthe leading $1/J$ correction calculated in this picture reproduces the known\ncorrection to the poles of the SYK propagator, providing credence to a\nconjecture that the bulk dual of this model can be interpreted as a three\ndimensional theory.\n", "  We present the correlation function of the luminosity distances in a flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM universe. Decomposing the luminosity distance fluctuation into the\nvelocity, the gravitational potential, and the lensing contributions, we study\ntheir individual contributions to the correlation function. The lensing\ncontribution is important at large redshift ($z\\gtrsim 0.5$) but only for small\nangular separation ($\\theta \\lesssim 3^\\circ$), while the velocity contribution\ndominates over the other contributions at low redshift or at larger separation.\nHowever, the gravitational potential contribution is always subdominant at all\nscale, if the correct gauge-invariant expression is used. The correlation\nfunction of the luminosity distances depends significantly on the matter\ncontent, especially for the lensing contribution, thus providing a novel tool\nof estimating cosmological parameters.\n", "  We discover an intrinsic superspin Hall current: an injected charge\nsupercurrent in a Josephson junction containing heavy normal metals and a\nferromagnet generates a transverse spin supercurrent. There is no accompanying\ndissipation of energy, in contrast to the conventional spin Hall effect. The\nphysical origin of the effect is an antisymmetric spin density induced among\ntransverse modes $k_y$ near the interface of the superconductor arising due to\nthe coexistence of $p$-wave and conventional $s$-wave superconducting\ncorrelations with a belonging phase mismatch. Our predictions can be tested in\nhybrid structures including thin heavy metal layers combined with strong\nferromagnets and ordinary $s$-wave superconductors.\n", "  We mine the Tycho-{\\it Gaia} astrometric solution (TGAS) catalog for wide\nstellar binaries by matching positions, proper motions, and astrometric\nparallaxes. We separate genuine binaries from unassociated stellar pairs\nthrough a Bayesian formulation that includes correlated uncertainties in the\nproper motions and parallaxes. Rather than relying on assumptions about the\nstructure of the Galaxy, we calculate Bayesian priors and likelihoods based on\nthe nature of Keplerian orbits and the TGAS catalog itself. We calibrate our\nmethod using radial velocity measurements and obtain 6196 high-confidence\ncandidate wide binaries with projected separations $s\\lesssim1$ pc. The\nnormalization of this distribution suggests that at least 0.6\\% of TGAS stars\nhave an associated, distant TGAS companion in a wide binary. We demonstrate\nthat {\\it Gaia}'s astrometry is precise enough that it can detect projected\norbital velocities in wide binaries with orbital periods as large as 10$^6$ yr.\nFor pairs with $s\\ \\lesssim\\ 4\\times10^4$~AU, characterization of random\nalignments indicate our contamination to be $\\approx$5\\%. For $s \\lesssim\n5\\times10^3$~AU, our distribution is consistent with \\\"{O}pik's Law. At larger\nseparations, the distribution is steeper and consistent with a power-law\n$P(s)\\propto s^{-1.6}$; there is no evidence in our data of any bimodality in\nthis distribution for $s \\lesssim$ 1 pc. Using radial velocities, we\ndemonstrate that at large separations, i.e., of order $s \\sim$ 1 pc and beyond,\nany potential sample of genuine wide binaries in TGAS cannot be easily\ndistinguished from ionized former wide binaries, moving groups, or\ncontamination from randomly aligned stars.\n", "  We compile a sample of spectral energy distribution (SED) of 12 GeV radio\ngalaxies (RGs), including eight FR I RGs and four FR II RGs. These SEDs can be\nrepresented with the one-zone leptonic model. No significant unification as\nexpected in the unification model is found for the derived jet parameters\nbetween FR I RGs and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) and between FR II RGs and\nflat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). However, on average FR I RGs have the\nlarger gamma_b (break Lorentz factor of electrons) and lower B (magnetic field\nstrength) than FR II RGs, analogous to the differences between BL Lacs and\nFSRQs. The derived Doppler factors (delta) of RGs are on average smaller than\nthat of balzars, which is consistent with the unification model that RGs are\nthe misaligned parent populations of blazars with smaller delta. On the basis\nof jet parameters from SED fits, we calculate their jet powers and the powers\ncarried by each component, and compare their jet compositions and radiation\nefficiencies with blazars. Most of the RG jets may be dominated by particles,\nlike BL Lacs, not FSRQs. However, the jets of RGs with higher radiation\nefficiencies tend to have higher jet magnetization. A strong anticorrelation\nbetween synchrotron peak frequency and jet power is observed for the GeV RGs\nand blazars in both the observer and co-moving frames, indicating that the\n\"sequence\" behavior among blazars, together with the GeV RGs, may be dominated\nby the jet power intrinsically.\n", "  We apply a recently developed effective string theory for vortex lines to the\ncase of two-dimensional trapped superfluids. We do not assume a perturbative\nmicroscopic description for the superfluid, but only a gradient expansion for\nthe long-distance hydrodynamical description and for the trapping potential.\nFor any regular trapping potential, we compute the spatial dependence of the\nsuperfluid density and the orbital frequency and trajectory of an off-center\nvortex. Our results are fully relativistic, and in the non-relativistic limit\nreduce to known results based on the Gross-Pitaevskii model. In our formalism,\nthe leading effect in the non-relativistic limit arises from two simple Feynman\ndiagrams in which the vortex interacts with the trapping potential through the\nexchange of hydrodynamical modes.\n", "  A solution to the second measurement problem, determining what prior\nmicroscopic properties can be inferred from measurement outcomes (\"pointer\npositions\"), is worked out for projective and generalized (POVM) measurements,\nusing consistent histories. The result supports the idea that equipment\nproperly designed and calibrated reveals the properties it was designed to\nmeasure. Applications include Einstein's hemisphere and Wheeler's delayed\nchoice paradoxes, and a method for analyzing weak measurements without recourse\nto weak values. Quantum measurements are noncontextual in the original sense\nemployed by Bell and Mermin: if $[A,B]=[A,C]=0,\\, [B,C]\\neq 0$, the outcome of\nan $A$ measurement does not depend on whether it is measured with $B$ or with\n$C$. An application to Bohm's model of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen situation\nsuggests that a faulty understanding of quantum measurements is at the root of\nthis paradox.\n", "  Layered semi-convection is a possible candidate to explain Saturn's\nluminosity excess and the abnormally large radius of some hot Jupiters. In\ngiant planet interiors, it could lead to the creation of density staircases,\nwhich are convective layers separated by thin stably stratified interfaces. We\nstudy the propagation of internal waves in a region of layered semi-convection,\nwith the aim to predict energy transport by internal waves incident upon a\ndensity staircase. The goal is then to understand the resulting tidal\ndissipation when these waves are excited by other bodies such as moons in giant\nplanets systems. We use a local Cartesian analytical model, taking into account\nthe complete Coriolis acceleration at any latitude, thus generalizing previous\nworks. We find transmission of incident internal waves to be strongly affected\nby the presence of a density staircase, even if these waves are initially pure\ninertial waves (which are restored by the Coriolis acceleration). In\nparticular, low-frequency waves of all wavelengths are perfectly transmitted\nnear the critical latitude. Otherwise, short-wavelength waves are only\nefficiently transmitted if they are resonant with a free mode (interfacial\ngravity wave or short-wavelength inertial mode) of the staircase. In all other\ncases, waves are primarily reflected unless their wavelengths are longer than\nthe vertical extent of the entire staircase (not just a single step). We expect\nincident internal waves to be strongly affected by the presence of a density\nstaircase in a frequency-, latitude- and wavelength-dependent manner. First,\nthis could lead to new criteria to probe the interior of giant planets by\nseismology; and second, this may have important consequences for tidal\ndissipation and our understanding of the evolution of giant planet systems.\n", "  Long-duration, spectrally-soft Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are associated with\nType Ic Core Collapse (CC) Supernovae (SNe), and thus arise from the death of\nmassive stars. In the collapsar model, the jet launched by the central engine\nmust bore its way out of the progenitor star before it can produce a GRB. Most\nof these jets do not break out, and are instead \"choked\" inside the star, as\nthe central-engine activity time, $t_{\\rm e}$, is not long enough. Modelling\nthe long-soft GRB duration distribution assuming a power-law distribution for\ntheir central-engine activity times, $\\propto t_{\\rm e}^{-\\alpha}$ for $t_{\\rm\ne}>t_{\\rm b}$, we find a steep distribution ($\\alpha\\sim4$) and a typical GRB\njet breakout time of $t_{\\rm b}\\sim 60\\text{ s}$ in the star's frame. The\nlatter suggests the presence of a low-density, extended envelope surrounding\nthe progenitor star, similar to that previously inferred for low-luminosity\nGRBs. Extrapolating the range of validity of this power law below what is\ndirectly observable, to $t_{\\rm e}<t_{\\rm b}$, by only a factor of $\\sim$4-5\nproduces enough events to account for all Type Ib/c SNe. Such extrapolation is\nnecessary to avoid fine-tuning the distribution of central engine activity\ntimes with the breakout time, which are presumably unrelated. We speculate that\ncentral engines launching relativistic jets may operate in all Type Ib/c SNe.\nIn this case, the existence of a common central engine would imply that (i) the\njet may significantly contribute to the energy of the SN; (ii) various\nobservational signatures, like the asphericity of the explosion, could be\ndirectly related to jet's interaction with the star.\n", "  The flux of very high-energy neutrinos produced in our Galaxy by the\ninteraction of accelerated cosmic rays with the interstellar medium is not yet\ndetermined. The characterization of this flux will shed light on Galactic\naccelerator features, gas distribution morphology and Galactic cosmic ray\ntransport. The central Galactic plane can be the site of an enhanced neutrino\nproduction, thus leading to anisotropies in the extraterrestrial neutrino\nsignal as measured by the IceCube Collaboration. The ANTARES neutrino\ntelescope, located in the Mediterranean Sea, offers a favourable view on this\npart of the sky, thereby allowing for a contribution to the determination of\nthis flux. The expected diffuse Galactic neutrino emission can be obtained\nlinking a model of generation and propagation of cosmic rays with the\nmorphology of the gas distribution in the Milky Way. In this paper, the\nso-called \"Gamma model\" introduced recently to explain the high-energy gamma\nray diffuse Galactic emission, is assumed as reference. The neutrino flux\npredicted by the \"Gamma model\" depends of the assumed primary cosmic ray\nspectrum cut-off. Considering a radially-dependent diffusion coefficient, this\nproposed scenario is able to account for the local cosmic ray measurements, as\nwell as for the Galactic gamma ray observations. Nine years of ANTARES data are\nused in this work to search for a possible Galactic contribution according to\nthis scenario. All flavour neutrino interactions are considered. No excess of\nevents is observed and an upper limit is set on the neutrino flux of $1.1$\n($1.2$) times the prediction of the \"Gamma model\" assuming the primary cosmic\nray spectrum cut-off at 5 (50) PeV. This limit excludes the diffuse Galactic\nneutrino emission as the major cause of the \"spectral anomaly\" between the two\nhemispheres measured by IceCube.\n", "  Quantum gravity computations suggest the existence of an ultraviolet and an\ninfrared fixed point where quantum scale invariance emerges as an exact\nsymmetry. We discuss a particular variable gravity model for the crossover\nbetween these fixed points which can naturally account for inflation and dark\nenergy, using a single scalar field. In the Einstein-frame formulation the\npotential can be expressed in terms of Lambert functions, interpolating between\na power-law inflationary potential and a mixed-quintessence potential. For two\nnatural heating scenarios, the transition between inflation and radiation\ndomination proceeds through a \"graceful reheating\" stage. The radiation\ntemperature significantly exceeds the temperature of big bang nucleosynthesis.\nFor this type of model, the observable consequences of the heating process can\nbe summarized in a single parameter, the heating efficiency. Our quantitative\nanalysis of compatibility with cosmological observations reveals the existence\nof realistic models able to describe the whole history of the Universe using\nonly a single metric and scalar field and involving just a small number of\norder one parameters.\n", "  We study the impact of large-scale perturbations from convective shell\nburning on the core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism using\nthree-dimensional (3D) multi-group neutrino hydrodynamics simulations of an 18\nsolar mass progenitor. Seed asphericities in the O shell, obtained from a\nrecent 3D model of O shell burning, help trigger a neutrino-driven explosion\n330ms after bounce whereas the shock is not revived in a model based on a\nspherically symmetric progenitor for at least another 300ms. We tentatively\ninfer a reduction of the critical luminosity for shock revival by ~20% due to\npre-collapse perturbations. This indicates that convective seed perturbations\nplay an important role in the explosion mechanism in some progenitors. We\nfollow the evolution of the 18 solar mass model into the explosion phase for\nmore than 2s and find that the cycle of accretion and mass ejection is still\nongoing at this stage. With a preliminary value of 0.77 Bethe for the\ndiagnostic explosion energy, a baryonic neutron star mass of 1.85 solar masses,\na neutron star kick of ~600km/s and a neutron star spin period of ~20ms at the\nend of the simulation, the explosion and remnant properties are slightly\natypical, but still lie comfortably within the observed distribution. Although\nmore refined simulations and a larger survey of progenitors are still called\nfor, this suggests that a solution to the problem of shock revival and\nexplosion energies in the ballpark of observations are within reach for\nneutrino-driven explosions in 3D.\n", "  Parallaxes for 331 classical Cepheids, 31 Type II Cepheids and 364 RR Lyrae\nstars in common between Gaia and the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues are\npublished in Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) as part of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric\nSolution (TGAS). In order to test these first parallax measurements of the\nprimary standard candles of the cosmological distance ladder, that involve\nastrometry collected by Gaia during the initial 14 months of science operation,\nwe compared them with literature estimates and derived new period-luminosity\n($PL$), period-Wesenheit ($PW$) relations for classical and Type II Cepheids\nand infrared $PL$, $PL$-metallicity ($PLZ$) and optical luminosity-metallicity\n($M_V$-[Fe/H]) relations for the RR Lyrae stars, with zero points based on\nTGAS. The new relations were computed using multi-band\n($V,I,J,K_{\\mathrm{s}},W_{1}$) photometry and spectroscopic metal abundances\navailable in the literature, and applying three alternative approaches: (i) by\nlinear least squares fitting the absolute magnitudes inferred from direct\ntransformation of the TGAS parallaxes, (ii) by adopting astrometric-based\nluminosities, and (iii) using a Bayesian fitting approach. TGAS parallaxes\nbring a significant added value to the previous Hipparcos estimates. The\nrelations presented in this paper represent first Gaia-calibrated relations and\nform a \"work-in-progress\" milestone report in the wait for Gaia-only parallaxes\nof which a first solution will become available with Gaia's Data Release 2\n(DR2) in 2018.\n", "  Recent observations show a population of active galaxies with milliarcseconds\noffsets between optical and radio emission. Such offsets can be an indication\nof extreme phenomena associated with supermassive black holes including\nrelativistic jets, binary supermassive black holes, or even recoiling\nsupermassive black holes. However, the multi-wavelength structure of active\ngalaxies at a few milliarcseconds cannot be fathomed with direct observations.\nWe propose using strong gravitational lensing to elucidate the multi-wavelength\nstructure of sources. When sources are located close to the caustic of lensing\ngalaxy, even small offset in the position of the sources results in a drastic\ndifference in the position and magnification of mirage images. We show that the\nangular offset in the position of the sources can be amplified more than 50\ntimes in the observed position of mirage images. We find that at least 8% of\nthe observed gravitationally lensed quasars will be in the caustic\nconfiguration. The synergy between SKA and Euclid will provide an ideal set of\nobservations for thousands of gravitationally lensed sources in the caustic\nconfiguration, which will allow us to elucidate the multi-wavelength structure\nfor a large ensemble of sources, and study the physical origin of radio\nemissions, their connection to supermassive black holes, and their cosmic\nevolution.\n", "  Milli-magnetically charged particles generically appear in scenarios with\nkinetic mixing. We present model independent bounds on these particles coming\nfrom magnetars. Schwinger pair production discharges the magnetic field of the\nmagnetar. Thus the existence of large magnetic fields at magnetars place strong\nbounds on the milli-magnetic charge to be smaller than $10^{-18}$ over a large\nmass range.\n", "  We generalize the Green-Kubo approach, previously applied to bulk systems of\nspherically symmetric active particles [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 161101 (2016)], to\ninclude spatially inhomogeneous activity. The method is applied to predict the\nspatial dependence of the average orientation per particle and the density. The\naverage orientation is given by an integral over the self-part of the van Hove\nfunction and a simple Gaussian approximation to this quantity yields an\naccurate analytical expression. Taking this analytical result as input to a\ndynamic density functional theory approximates the spatial dependence of the\ndensity in good agreement with simulation data. All theoretical predictions are\nvalidated using Brownian dynamics simulations.\n", "  The often elusive Poincar\\'e recurrence can be witnessed in a completely\nseparable system. For such systems, the problem of recurrence reduces to the\nclassic mathematical problem of simultaneous Diophantine approximation of\nmultiple numbers. The latter problem then can be somewhat satisfactorily solved\nby using the famous Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov\\'{a}sz (LLL) algorithm, which is\nimplemented in the Mathematica built-in function \\verb\"LatticeReduce\". The\nprocedure is illustrated with a harmonic chain. The incredibly large recurrence\ntimes are obtained exactly. They follow the expected scaling law very well.\n", "  We consider the possibility that the universe, viewed as a three-brane,\noriginated in a region of strong external field strength due to a four-form\ngauge field in the bulk. It is shown that in a scenario of this kind inflation\nis generic for a wide range of initial conditions. This is true even for small\nfield inflation with a simple quadratic inflaton potential, as well as for\nHiggs potentials with the initial field well away from the local maximum, not\nnecessarily starting from rest. The power spectrum, spectral index, and $r$\nparameter help to constrain parameters in this scenario, and $r<0.1$ favors\nHiggs potentials.\n", "  The purpose of physics is to describe nature from elementary particles all\nthe way up to cosmological objects like cluster of galaxies and black holes.\nAlthough a unified description for all this spectrum of events is desirable,\nthis would be highly impractical. To not get lost in unnecessary details,\neffective descriptions are mandatory. Here we analyze the dynamics that may\nemerge from a full quantum description when one does not have access to all the\ndegrees of freedom of a system. More concretely, we describe the properties of\nthe dynamics that arise from quantum mechanics if one has access only to a\ncoarse-grained description of the system. We obtain that the effective maps are\nnot necessarily of Kraus form, due to correlations between accessible and\nnonaccessible degrees of freedom, and that the distance between two effective\nstates may increase under the action of the effective map. We expect our\nframework to be useful for addressing questions such as the thermalization of\nclosed quantum systems, as well as the description of measurements in quantum\nmechanics.\n", "  Within the framework of the average approach and direct 3D PIC\n(particle-in-cell) simulations we demonstrate that the gyrotrons operating in\nthe regime of developed turbulence can sporadically emit \"giant\" spikes with\nintensities a factor of 100-150 greater than the average radiation power and a\nfactor of 6-9 exceeding the power of the driving electron beams. Together with\nthe statistical features such as a long-tail probability distribution, this\nallows the interpretation of generated spikes as microwave rogue waves. The\nmechanism of spikes formation is related to the simultaneous cyclotron\ninteraction of a gyrating electron beam with forward and backward waves near\nthe waveguide cutoff frequency as well as with the longitudinal deceleration of\nelectrons.\n", "  We calculate the effect of impurities on the superconducting phase diagram of\ntransition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in the presence of an in-plane\nmagnetic field. Due to strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, the upper critical\nfield greatly surpasses the Pauli limit at low temperatures. We find that it is\ninsensitive to intravalley scattering and, ultimately, limited by intervalley\nscattering.\n", "  We attempt to understand the baryon-dark-matter coincidence problem within\nthe quark seesaw extension of the standard model where parity invariance is\nused to solve the strong CP problem. The $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times\nU(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry of this model is extended by a dark $U(1)_X$ group\nplus inclusion of a heavy neutral vector-like fermion $\\chi_{L,R}$ charged\nunder the dark group which plays the role of dark matter. All fermions are\nDirac type in this model. Decay of heavy scalars charged under $U(1)_X$ leads\nto simultaneous asymmetry generation of the dark matter and baryons after\nsphaleron effects are included. The $U(1)_X$ group not only helps to stabilize\nthe dark matter but also helps in the elimination of the symmetric part of the\ndark matter via $\\chi-\\bar{\\chi}$ annihilation. For dark matter mass near the\nproton mass, it explains why the baryon and dark matter abundances are of\nsimilar magnitude (the baryon-dark-matter coincidence problem). This model is\ntestable in low threshold (sub-keV) direct dark matter search experiments.\n", "  Sky subtraction is the key technique in data reduction of multi-fiber\nspectra. Knowledge of the related instrument character is necessary to\ndetermine the method adopted in sky subtraction. In this study, we described\nthe sky subtraction method designed for LAMOST(Large sky Area Multi-Object\nfiber Spectroscopic Telescope) survey. The method has been intergrated into\nLAMOST 2D Pipeline v2.6 and applied to data of LAMOST DR3 and later. For\nLAMOST, sky emission line calibration is used to alleviate the\nposition-dependent (thus time-dependent) ~4% fiber throughput uncertainty and\nthe small wavelength instability (0.1\\AA ) during observation. PCA (Principal\nComponent Analysis) sky subtraction further reduces 25% of the sky line\nresidual of the OH lines in the red part of the LAMOST spectra after the mater\nsky spectrum, which is derived from a B-spline fit of 20 sky fibers in each\nspectrograph, is adjusted by sky emission line and subtracted from each fiber.\nFurther analysis shows that our wavelength calibration accuracy is about\n4.5km/s, and the average sky subtraction residuals are about 3% for sky\nemission lines and 3% for continuum region. The relative sky subtraction\nresiduals vary with the moon light background brightness, could reach as low as\n1.5% for the sky emission line regions in the dark night. Tests on the F stars\nof both similar sky emission line strength and similar object continuum\nintensity show that the sky emission line residual of LAMOST is smaller than\nthose of SDSS survey.\n", "  We propose a simple scheme to construct a model whose Fermi surface is\ncomprised of crossing-line nodes. The Hamiltonian consists of a normal hopping\nterm and an additional term which is odd under the mirror reflection. The line\nnodes appear along the mirror-invariant planes, where each line node carries\nthe quantized Berry magnetic flux. We explicitly construct a model with the\n$N$-fold rotational symmetry, where the $2N$ line nodes merge at the north and\nsouth poles. Photoirradiation induces a topological phase transition. When we\napply photoirradiation along the $k_z$ axis, there emerge point nodes carrying\nthe monopole charge $\\pm N$ at these poles, while all the line nodes disappear.\nThe resultant system describes anisotropic multiple-Weyl fermions.\n", "  The rejection of forward jets originating from additional proton--proton\ninteractions (pile-up) is crucial for a variety of physics analyses at the LHC,\nincluding Standard Model measurements and searches for physics beyond the\nStandard Model. The identification of such jets is challenging due to the lack\nof track and vertex information in the pseudorapidity range $|\\eta|>2.5$. This\npaper presents a novel strategy for forward pile-up jet tagging that exploits\njet shapes and topological jet correlations in pile-up interactions.\nMeasurements of the per-jet tagging efficiency are presented using a data set\nof 3.2 $fb^{-1}$ of proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\nTeV collected with the ATLAS detector. The fraction of pile-up jets rejected in\nthe range $2.5<|\\eta|<4.5$ is estimated in simulated events with an average of\n22 interactions per bunch-crossing. It increases with jet transverse momentum\nand, for jets with transverse momentum between 20 and 50 GeV, it ranges between\n49% and 67% with an efficiency of 85% for selecting hard-scatter jets. A case\nstudy is performed in Higgs boson production via the vector-boson fusion\nprocess, showing that these techniques mitigate the background growth due to\nadditional proton--proton interactions, thus enhancing the reach for such\nsignatures.\n", "  Quantum networks require flying qubits that transfer information between the\nnodes. This may be implemented by means of single atoms (the nodes) that emit\nand absorb single photons (the flying qubits) and requires full control of\nphoton absorption and emission by the individual emitters. In this work, we\ntheoretically characterize the wave packet of a photon emitted by a single atom\nundergoing a spontaneous Raman transition in a three-level scheme. We\ninvestigate several excitation schemes that are experimentally relevant and\ndiscuss control parameters that allow one to tailor the spectrum of the emitted\nphoton wave packet.\n", "  We investigate the occurrence of a phase transition, characterized by the\nspontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry, in a driven-dissipative\nBose-Hubbard lattice in presence of two-photon coherent driving. The driving\nterm does not lift the original $U(1)$ symmetry completely and a discrete\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is left. When driving the bottom of the Bose-Hubbard\nband, a mean-field analysis of the steady state reveals a second-order\ntransition from a symmetric phase to a quasi-coherent state with a finite\nexpectation value of the Bose field. For larger driving frequency, the phase\ndiagram shows a third region, where both phases are stable and the transition\nbecomes of first order.\n", "  In recent years, the autocorrelation of the hydrogen Lyman-{\\alpha} forest\nhas been used to observe the baryon acoustic peak at redshift 2 < z < 3.5 using\ntens of thousands of QSO spectra from the BOSS survey. However, the\ninterstellar medium of the Milky-Way introduces absorption lines into the\nspectrum of any extragalactic source. These lines, while weak and undetectable\nin a single BOSS spectrum, could potentially bias the cosmological signal. In\norder to examine this, we generate absorption line maps by stacking over a\nmillion spectra of galaxies and QSOs. We find that the systematics introduced\nare too small to affect the current accuracy of the baryon acoustic peak, but\nmight be relevant to future surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument (DESI). We outline a method to account for this with future\ndatasets.\n", "  Recent advances in the experimental growth and control of disordered thin\nfilms, heterostructures, and interfaces provide a fertile ground for the\nobservation and characterisation of the collective superconducting excitations\nemerging below $T_c$ after breaking the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. Here we combine\nTHz experiments in a nano-structured granular Al thin film and theoretical\ncalculations to demonstrate the existence of optically-active phase modes,\nwhich represent the Goldstone excitations of the broken gauge symmetry. By\nmeasuring the complex transmission trough the sample we identify a sizeable and\ntemperature-dependent optical sub-gap absorption, which cannot be ascribed to\nquasiparticle excitations. A quantitative modelling of this material as a\ndisordered Josephson array of nano-grains allows us to determine, with no free\nparameters, the structure of the spatial inhomogeneities induced by shell\neffects. Besides being responsible for the enhancement of the critical\ntemperature with respect to bulk Al, already observed in the past, this spatial\ninhomogeneity provides a mechanism for the optical visibility of the Goldstone\nmode. By computing explicitly the optical spectrum of the superconducting phase\nfluctuations we obtain a good quantitative description of the experimental\ndata. Our results demonstrate that nanograins arrays are a promising setting to\nstudy and control the collective superconducting excitations via optical means.\n", "  Here we study the rapid X-ray variability (using XMM-Newton observations) of\nthree neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries (1RXS J180408.9-342058, EXO\n1745-248, and IGR J18245-2452) during their recently proposed very hard\nspectral state (Parikh et al. 2017). All our systems exhibit a strong to very\nstrong noise component in their power density spectra (rms amplitudes ranging\nfrom 34% to 102%) with very low characteristic frequencies (as low as 0.01 Hz).\nThese properties are more extreme than what is commonly observed in the\ncanonical hard state of neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries observed at X-ray\nluminosities similar to those we observe from our sources. This suggests that\nindeed the very hard state is a distinct spectral-timing state from the hard\nstate, although we argue that the variability behaviour of IGR J18245-2452 is\nvery extreme and possibly this source was in a very unusual state. We also\ncompare our results with the rapid X-ray variability of the accreting\nmillisecond X-ray pulsars IGR J00291+5934 and Swift J0911.9-6452 (also using\nXMM-Newton data) for which previously similar variability phenomena were\nobserved. Although their energy spectra (as observed using the Swift X-ray\ntelescope) were not necessarily as hard (i.e., for Swift J0911.9-6452) as for\nour other three sources, we conclude that likely both sources were also in very\nsimilar state during their XMM-Newton observations. This suggest that different\nsources that are found in this new state might exhibit different spectral\nhardness and one has to study both the spectral as well as rapid variability to\nidentify this unusual state.\n", "  It is well known that the annihilation of Majorana dark matter into fermions\nis helicity suppressed. Here, we point out that the underlying mechanism is a\nsubtle combination of two distinct effects, and we present a comprehensive\nanalysis of how the suppression can be partially or fully lifted by the\ninternal bremsstrahlung of an additional boson in the final state. As a\nconcrete illustration, we compute analytically the full amplitudes and\nannihilation rates of supersymmetric neutralinos to final states that contain\nany combination of two standard model fermions, plus one electroweak gauge\nboson or one of the five physical Higgs bosons that appear in the minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model. We classify the various ways in which these\nthree-body rates can be large compared to the two-body rates, identifying cases\nthat have not been pointed out before. In our analysis, we put special emphasis\non how to avoid the double counting of identical kinematic situations that\nappear for two-body and three-body final states, in particular on how to\ncorrectly treat differential rates and the spectrum of the resulting stable\nparticles that is relevant for indirect dark matter searches. We find that both\nthe total annihilation rates and the yields can be significantly enhanced when\ntaking into account the corrections computed here, in particular for models\nwith somewhat small annihilation rates at tree-level which otherwise would not\nbe testable with indirect dark matter searches. Even more importantly, however,\nwe find that the resulting annihilation spectra of positrons, neutrinos,\ngamma-rays and antiprotons differ in general substantially from the\nmodel-independent spectra that are commonly adopted, for these final states,\nwhen constraining particle dark matter with indirect detection experiments.\n", "  Triple-W-boson production in proton-proton collisions allows for a direct\naccess to the triple and quartic gauge couplings and provides a window to the\nmechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. It is an important process to test\nthe Standard Model (SM) and might be background to physics beyond the SM. We\npresent a calculation of the next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak\ncorrections to the production of WWW final states at proton-proton colliders\nwith on-shell W bosons and combine the electroweak with the NLO QCD\ncorrections. We study the impact of the corrections to the integrated cross\nsections and to kinematic distributions of the W bosons. The electroweak\ncorrections are generically of the size of 5-10% for integrated cross sections\nand become more pronounced in specific phase-space regions. The real\ncorrections induced by quark-photon scattering turn out to be as important as\nelectroweak loops and photon bremsstrahlung corrections, but can be reduced by\nphase-space cuts. Considering that prior determinations of the photon parton\ndistribution function (PDF) involve rather large uncertainties, we compare the\nresults obtained with different photon PDFs and discuss the corresponding\nuncertainties in the NLO predictions. Moreover, we determine the scale and\ntotal PDF uncertainties at the LHC and a possible future 100 TeV pp collider.\n", "  We compute the zero-temperature conductivity in the two-dimensional quantum\n$\\mathrm{O}(N)$ model using a nonperturbative functional renormalization-group\napproach. At the quantum critical point we find a universal conductivity\n$\\sigma^*/\\sigma_Q$ (with $\\sigma_Q=q^2/h$ the quantum of conductance and $q$\nthe charge) in reasonable quantitative agreement with quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations and conformal bootstrap results. In the ordered phase the\nconductivity tensor is defined, when $N\\geq 3$, by two independent elements,\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}}(\\omega)$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega)$, respectively\nassociated to $\\mathrm{O}(N)$ rotations which do and do not change the\ndirection of the order parameter. Whereas $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}}(\\omega\\to 0)$\ncorresponds to the response of a superfluid (or perfect inductance), the\nnumerical solution of the flow equations shows that $\\lim_{\\omega\\to\n0}\\sigma_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega)/\\sigma_Q=\\sigma_{\\mathrm{B}}^*/\\sigma_Q$ is a\nsuperuniversal (i.e. $N$-independent) constant. These numerical results, as\nwell as the known exact value $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{B}}^*/\\sigma_Q=\\pi/8$ in the\nlarge-$N$ limit, allow us to conjecture that\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{B}}^*/\\sigma_Q=\\pi/8$ holds for all values of $N$, a result\nthat can be understood as a consequence of gauge invariance and asymptotic\nfreedom of the Goldstone bosons in the low-energy limit.\n", "  We present experimental evidence of metastable magnetic domains in\ncylindrical CoNi nanowires. Transverse (perpendicular) domains have been\npreviously observed only in flat nanostrips. Here they are found together with\nmore conventional vortex domains along the same cylindrical nanowire, denoting\na bistable system with similar free energies. The surface and the inner\nmagnetization distribution in both types of domains are analyzed by\nPhoto-Emission Electron Microscopy (PEEM) with X-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism (XMCD) contrast, and hysteresis loop in individual nanowires are\nmeasured by Magneto-optical Kerr effect. These experimental data are understood\nand compared with complementary micromagnetic simulations. The transverse\ndomain states are potentially more important for sensing and recording\napplications than commonly observed vortex domains since they create larger\nsurface stray fields.\n", "  One of the challenges in testing gravity with cosmology is the vast freedom\nopened when extending General Relativity. For linear perturbations, one\nsolution consists in using the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFT of\nDE). Even then, the theory space is described in terms of a handful of free\nfunctions of time. This needs to be reduced to a finite number of parameters to\nbe practical for cosmological surveys. We explore in this article how well\nsimple parametrizations, with a small number of parameters, can fit observables\ncomputed from complex theories. Imposing the stability of linear perturbations\nappreciably reduces the theory space we explore. We find that observables are\nnot extremely sensitive to short time-scale variations and that simple, smooth\nparametrizations are usually sufficient to describe this theory space. Using\nthe Bayesian Information Criterion, we find that using two parameters for each\nfunction (an amplitude and a power law index) is preferred over complex models\nfor 86% of our theory space.\n", "  We explore the feasibility of detecting Earth analogs around Sun-like stars\nusing the radial velocity method by investigating one of the largest radial\nvelocities datasets for the one of the most stable radial-velocity stars\nHD20794. We proceed by disentangling the Keplerian signals from correlated\nnoise and activity-induced variability. We diagnose the noise using the\ndifferences between radial velocities measured at different wavelength ranges,\nso-called \"differential radial velocities\". We apply this method to the radial\nvelocities measured by HARPS, and identify four signals at 18, 89, 147 and 330\nd. The two signals at periods of 18 and 89 d are previously reported and are\nbetter quantified in this work. The signal at a period of about 147 d is\nreported for the first time, and corresponds to a super-Earth with a minimum\nmass of 4.59 Earth mass located 0.51 AU from HD20794. We also find a\nsignificant signal at a period of about 330 d corresponding to a super-Earth or\nNeptune in the habitable zone. Since this signal is close to the annual\nsampling period and significant periodogram power in some noise proxies are\nfound close to this signal, further observations and analyses are required to\nconfirm it. The analyses of the eccentricity and consistency of signals provide\nweak evidence for the existence of the previously reported 43 d signal and a\nnew signal at a period of about 11.9 d with a semi amplitude of 0.4 m/s. We\nfind that the detection of a number of signals with radial velocity variations\naround 0.5\\,m/s likely caused by low mass planet candidates demonstrates the\nimportant role of noise modeling in searching for Earth analogs.\n", "  Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are long-range entangled states of quantum\nmagnets which lie beyond the Landau paradigm of classifying phases of matter\nvia broken symmetries. A physical route to arriving at QSLs is via\nfrustration-induced quantum melting of ordered states such as valence bond\ncrystals or magnetic orders. Here, we show, using extensive exact\ndiagonalization (ED) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) studies of\nconcrete $SU(2)$ invariant spin models on honeycomb, triangular and square\nlattices, that chiral spin liquids (CSLs) emerge as descendants of triple-$Q$\nspin crystals with tetrahedral magnetic order and a large scalar spin\nchirality. Such ordered-to-CSL melting transitions may yield lattice\nrealizations of effective Chern-Simons-Higgs field theories. Our work provides\na distinct unifying perspective on the emergence of CSLs, and suggests that\nmaterials with magnetic skyrmion crystal order might provide a good starting\npoint to search for CSLs.\n", "  Simulation and experimental realization of acoustic black holes in analogue\ngravity systems have lead to a novel understanding of relevant phenomena such\nas Hawking radiation or superradiance. We explore here the possibility to use\nrelativistic systems for simulating rotating black hole solutions and possibly\nget an acoustic analogue of a Kerr black hole. In doing so we demonstrate a\nprecise relation between non-relativistic and relativistic solutions and\nprovide a new class of vortex solutions for relativistic systems. Such\nsolutions might be used in the future as a test bed in numerical simulations as\nwell as concrete experiments.\n", "  We work out the low-energy expansion of the anomalous\n$f_1(1285)\\to\\rho\\gamma$ decay amplitude by using the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model\nwith $U(2)\\times U(2)$ chiral symmetric four-quark interactions in the\none-quark-loop approximation. The related processes $f_1(1285)\\to\\omega\\gamma$,\n$a_1(1260)\\to\\omega\\gamma$, and $a_1(1260)\\to\\rho\\gamma$, are also considered.\nAn effective meson Lagrangian responsible for $f_1\\rho\\gamma$,\n$f_1\\omega\\gamma$, $a_1\\rho\\gamma$ and $a_1\\omega\\gamma$ interactions is found.\nThe predicted radiative decay widths, $\\Gamma_{f_1\\to\\rho^0\\gamma}=311\\\n\\mbox{keV}$, $\\Gamma_{f_1\\to\\omega\\gamma}=34.3\\ \\mbox{keV}$,\n$\\Gamma_{a_1\\to\\rho^0\\gamma}=26.8\\ \\mbox{keV}$,\n$\\Gamma_{a_1\\to\\omega\\gamma}=238\\ \\mbox{keV}$, allow an experimental test of\nthe hypothesis that $f_1(1285)$ and $a_1(1260)$-mesons have a quark-antiquark\nnature. At present, only the $f_1(1285)\\to\\rho\\gamma$ decay has been measured.\nOur result is in remarkably good agreement with the recent data of CLAS\nCollaboration $\\Gamma_{f_1\\to\\rho^0\\gamma}=453\\pm 177\\ \\mbox{keV}$, but\ndisagrees with the PDG-based estimate of $\\Gamma_{f_1\\to\\rho^0\\gamma}=1326\\pm\n313\\ \\mbox{keV}$. The calculations presented require a minimum of theoretical\ninput, and are shown to be consistent with the non-renormalization theorems of\nQCD.\n", "  Theoretical descriptions of observable quantities in cosmological\nperturbation theory should be independent of coordinate systems. This statement\nis often referred to as gauge-invariance of observable quantities, and the\nsanity of their theoretical description is verified by checking its\ngauge-invariance. We argue that cosmological observables are invariant scalars\nunder diffeomorphisms and as a consequence their theoretical description is\ngauge-invariant, only at linear order in perturbations. Beyond linear order,\nthey are usually not gauge-invariant, and we provide the general law for the\ngauge-transformation that the perturbation part of an observable does obey. We\napply this finding to derive the second-order expression for the observational\nlight-cone average in cosmology and demonstrate that our expression is indeed\ninvariant under diffeomorphisms.\n", "  We investigate the short time quantum critical dynamics in the imaginary time\nrelaxation processes of finite size systems. Universal scaling behaviors exist\nin the imaginary time evolution and in particular, the system undergoes a\ncritical initial slip stage characterized by an exponent $\\theta$, in which an\ninitial power-law increase emerges in the imaginary time correlation function\nwhen the initial state has zero order parameter and vanishing correlation\nlength. Under different initial conditions, the quantum critical point and\ncritical exponents can be determined from the universal scaling behaviors. We\napply the method to the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models\nusing quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the one-dimensional case, we locate\nthe quantum critical point at $(h/J)_{c}=1.00003(8)$ \\thirdrevise{in the\nthermodynamic limit}, and estimate the critical initial slip exponent\n$\\theta=0.3734(2)$, static exponent $\\beta/\\nu=0.1251(2)$ \\thirdrevise{by\nanalyzing data on chains of length $L=32\\sim 256$ and $L=48\\sim 256$,\nrespectively}. For the two-dimensional square-lattice system, the critical\ncoupling ratio is given by $3.04451(7)$ \\thirdrevise{in the thermodynamic\nlimit} while the critical exponents are \\thirdrevise{$\\theta=0.209(4)$ and\n$\\beta/\\nu=0.518(1)$ estimated by data on systems of size $L=24\\sim 64$ and\n$L=32\\sim 64$, correspondingly.} Remarkably, the critical initial slip\nexponents obtained in both models are notably distinct from their classical\ncounterparts, owing to the essential differences between classical and quantum\ndynamics. The short time critical dynamics and the imaginary time relaxation\nQMC approach can be readily adapted to various models.\n", "  The Ward identities involving the currents associated to the spontaneously\nbroken scale and special conformal transformations are derived and used to\ndetermine, through linear order in the two soft-dilaton momenta, the\ndouble-soft behavior of scattering amplitudes involving two soft dilatons and\nany number of other particles. It turns out that the double-soft behavior is\nequivalent to performing two single-soft limits one after the other. We confirm\nthe new double-soft theorem perturbatively at tree-level in a $D$-dimensional\nconformal field theory model, as well as nonperturbatively by using the\n\"gravity dual'' of ${\\cal{N}}=4$ super Yang-Mills on the Coulomb branch; i.e.\nthe Dirac-Born-Infeld action on AdS${}_5 \\times S^5$.\n", "  We develop a theory of three-dimensional slow Rossby waves in rotating\nspherical density stratified convection. The Rossby waves with frequencies\nwhich are much smaller than the rotating frequency, are excited by a\nnon-axisymmetric instability from the equilibrium based on the developed\nconvection. These waves interact with the inertial waves and the density\nstratified convection. The density stratification is taken into account using\nthe anelastic approximation for very low-Mach-number flows. We study long-term\nplanetary Rossby waves with periods which are larger than two years. We suggest\nthat these waves are related to the Southern Oscillation and El Ni\\~{n}o. The\nEl Ni\\~{n}o is an irregularly periodical variation in winds and sea surface\ntemperatures over the tropical Pacific Ocean, while the Southern Oscillation is\nan oscillation in surface air pressure between the tropical eastern and the\nwestern Pacific Ocean. The strength of the Southern Oscillation is\ncharacterised by the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The developed theory is\napplied for the interpretation of the observed periods of the SOI. This study\ndemonstrates a good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the\nobservations.\n", "  Within the framework of scalar-tensor theories, we study the conditions that\nallow single field inflation dynamics on small cosmological scales to\nsignificantly differ from that of the large scales probed by the observations\nof cosmic microwave background. The resulting single field double inflation\nscenario is characterised by two consequent inflation eras, usually separated\nby a period where the slow-roll approximation fails. At large field values the\ndynamics of the inflaton is dominated by the interplay between its non-minimal\ncoupling to gravity and the radiative corrections to the inflaton\nself-coupling. For small field values the potential is, instead, dominated by a\npolynomial that results in a hilltop inflation. Without relying on the\nslow-roll approximation, which is invalidated by the appearance of the\nintermediate stage, we propose a concrete model that matches the current\nmeasurements of inflationary observables and employs the freedom granted by the\nframework on small cosmological scales to give rise to a sizeable population of\nprimordial black holes generated by large curvature fluctuations. We find that\nthese features generally require a potential with a local minimum. We show that\nthe associated primordial black hole mass function is only approximately\nlognormal.\n", "  In this paper we discuss a disordered $d$-dimensional Euclidean\n$\\lambda\\varphi^{4}$ model. The dominant contribution to the average free\nenergy of this system is written as a series of the replica partition functions\nof the model. In each replica partition function, using the saddle-point\nequations and imposing the replica symmetric ansatz, we show the presence of a\nspontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism in the disordered model. Moreover, the\nleading replica partition function must be described by a large-$N$ Euclidean\nreplica field theory. We discuss finite temperature effects considering\nperiodic boundary condition in Euclidean time and also using the\nLandau-Ginzburg approach. In the low temperature regime we prove the existence\nof $N$ instantons in the model.\n", "  We report the discovery of a super-Earth orbiting at the inner edge of the\nhabitable zone of the star GJ 625 based on the analysis of the radial-velocity\n(RV) time series from the HARPS-N spectrograph, consisting in 151 HARPS-N\nmeasurements taken over 3.5 yr. GJ 625 b is a planet with a minimum mass M sin\n$i$ of 2.82 $\\pm$ 0.51 M$_{\\oplus}$ with an orbital period of 14.628 $\\pm$\n0.013 days at a distance of 0.078 AU of its parent star. The host star is the\nquiet M2 V star GJ 625, located at 6.5 pc from the Sun. We find the presence of\na second radial velocity signal in the range 74-85 days that we relate to\nstellar rotation after analysing the time series of Ca II H\\&K and H${\\alpha}$\nspectroscopic indicators, the variations of the FWHM of the CCF and and the\nAPT2 photometric light curves. We find no evidence linking the short period\nradial velocity signal to any activity proxy.\n", "  We provide experimental evidence for confinement of water molecules in the\npores of hexagonal structure of YPO4 at elevated temperatures upto 600 K using\npowder neutron diffraction. In order to avoid the large incoherent scattering\nfrom the hydrogen, deuterated samples of doped YPO4:Ce-Eu were used for\ndiffraction measurements. The presence of water molecules in the triangular and\nhexagonal pores in the hexagonal structure was established by detailed\nsimulation of the diffraction pattern and Rietveld refinement of the\nexperimental data. It was observed that the presence of water leads\nspecifically to suppression of the intensity of a peak around Q = 1.04\n{\\AA}-1while the intensity of peaks around Q=1.83{\\AA}-1 is enhanced in the\nneutron diffraction pattern. We estimate the number of water molecules as 2.36\n(6) per formula units at 300 K and the sizes of the hexagonal and triangular\npores as7.2 (1) {\\AA} and 4.5 (1) {\\AA}, respectively. With increase in\ntemperature, the water content in both the pores decreases above 450 K and\nvanishes around 600 K. Analysis of the powder diffraction data reveals that the\nhexagonal structure with the pores persist up to 1273 K, and transforms to\nanother structure at 1323 K. The high temperature phase is not found to have\nthe zircon or the monazite type structure, but a monoclinic structure (space\ngroup P2/m) with lattice parameters am= 6.826 (4) {\\AA}, bm= 6.645 (4) {\\AA},\ncm= 10.435 (9){\\AA}, and \\b{eta}= 107.21 (6){\\deg}. The monoclinic structure\nhas about 14 % smaller volume than the hexagonal structure which essentially\nreflects the collapse of the pores. The phase transition and the change in the\nvolume are also confirmed by x-ray diffraction measurements. The hexagonal to\nthe monoclinic phase transition is found to be irreversible on cooling to room\ntemperature.\n", "  A ghost-free metric formulation of the recently proposed covariant Galileon\nmodel \\cite{RPgal} which retains the internal shift symmetry has been\nconstructed. This presents a new result because the covariant Galileon models\nintroduced so far in the literature lacks the full Galileon symmetry. We\ndemonstrate that the same general procedure is applicable to all the Galileon\ninteraction terms and the resulting ghost-free Galileon action respecting\ninternal shift symmetry cannot predict the late time acceleration of the\nuniverse. However, weakly breaking the shift symmetry in the covariant Galileon\nLagrangian, allows us to include an appropriate potential term which can\nexplain late time acceleration, in accordance with recent findings in the\nliterature.\n", "  Yang-Baxter (YB) deformations of string sigma model provide deformed target\nspaces. We propose that homogeneous YB deformations always lead to a certain\nclass of $\\beta$-twisted backgrounds and represent the bosonic part of the\nsupergravity fields in terms of the classical r-matrix associated with the YB\ndeformation. We then show that various $\\beta$-twisted backgrounds can be\nrealized by considering generalized diffeomorphisms in the undeformed\nbackground. Our result extends the notable relation between the YB deformations\nand (non-commuting) TsT transformations. We also discuss more general\ndeformations beyond the YB deformations.\n", "  In the original Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) presentation of the results of\ntransverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization for the Drell-Yan process,\nresults for perturbative coefficients can be obtained from calculations for\ncollinear factorization. Here we show how to use these results, plus known\nresults for the quark form factor, to obtain coefficients for TMD factorization\nin more recent formulations, e.g., that due to Collins, and apply them to known\nresults at order $\\alpha_s^2$ and $\\alpha_s^3$. We also show that the\n\"non-perturbative\" functions as obtained from fits to data are equal in the two\nschemes. We compile the higher-order perturbative inputs needed for the updated\nCSS scheme by appealing to results obtained in a variety of different\nformalisms. In addition, we derive the connection between both versions of the\nCSS formalism and several formalisms based in soft-collinear effective theory\n(SCET). Our work uses some important new results for factorization for the\nquark form factor, which we derive.\n", "  Coherent phonon (CP) generation in an undoped Si crystal is theoretically\ninvestigated to shed light on unexplored quantum-mechanical effects in the\nearly-time region immediately after the irradiation of ultrashort laser pulse.\nOne examines time signals attributed to an induced charge density of an ionic\ncore, placing the focus on the effects of the Rabi frequency $\\Omega_{0cv}$ on\nthe signals; this frequency corresponds to the peak electric-field of the\npulse. It is found that at specific $\\Omega_{0cv}$'s where the energy of\nplasmon caused by photoexcited carriers coincides with the longitudinal-optical\nphonon energy, the energetically {\\it resonant } interaction between these two\nmodes leads to striking anticrossings, revealing irregular oscillations with\nanomalously enhanced amplitudes in the observed time signals. Also, the\noscillatory pattern is subject to the Rabi flopping of the excited carrier\ndensity that is controlled by $\\Omega_{0cv}$. These findings show that the\nearly-time region is enriched with quantum-mechanical effects inherent in the\nCP generation, though experimental signals are more or less masked by the\nso-called coherent artifact due to nonlinear optical effects.\n", "  Orion KL is one of the most frequently observed sources in the Galaxy, and\nthe site where many molecular species have been discovered for the first time.\nWith the availability of powerful wideband backends, it is nowadays possible to\ncomplete spectral surveys in the entire mm-range to obtain a spectroscopically\nunbiased chemical picture of the region. In this paper we present a sensitive\nspectral survey of Orion KL, made with one of the 34m antennas of the Madrid\nDeep Space Communications Complex in Robledo de Chavela, Spain. The spectral\nrange surveyed is from 41.5 to 50 GHz, with a frequency spacing of 180 kHz\n(equivalent to about 1.2 km/s, depending on the exact frequency). The rms\nachieved ranges from 8 to 12 mK. The spectrum is dominated by the J=1-0 SiO\nmaser lines and by radio recombination lines (RRLs), which were detected up to\nDelta_n=11. Above a 3-sigma level, we identified 66 RRLs and 161 molecular\nlines corresponding to 39 isotopologues from 20 molecules; a total of 18 lines\nremain unidentified, two of them above a 5-sigma level. Results of radiative\nmodelling of the detected molecular lines (excluding masers) are presented. At\nthis frequency range, this is the most sensitive survey and also the one with\nthe widest band. Although some complex molecules like CH_3CH_2CN and CH_2CHCN\narise from the hot core, most of the detected molecules originate from the low\ntemperature components in Orion KL.\n", "  Context. Convection is a candidate to explain the trigger of red supergiant\nstar mass loss. Owing to the small size of the convective cells on the\nphotosphere, few of their characteristics are known. Aims. Using near infrared\ninterferometry, we intend to resolve the photosphere of red supergiant stars\nand to bring new constraints on their modeling. Methods. We observed the nearby\nred supergiant Antares using the 4-telescope instrument VLTI/PIONIER. We\ncollected data on the three available configurations of the 1.8m telescopes in\nthe H band. Results. We obtained unprecedented angular resolution on the disk\nof a star (6% of the star angular diameter) that limits the mean size of\nconvective cells, brings new constraints on numerical simulations. Using an\nanalytical model with a distribution of bright spots we determine their effect\non the visibility signal. Conclusion. We determine that the interferometric\nsignal on Antares is compatible with convective cells with various sizes from\n45% to 5% of the angular diameter. We also conclude that convective cells can\nstrongly affect the angular diameter and limb-darkening measurements. In\nparticular, the apparent angular diameter becomes dependent on the sampled\nposition angles.\n", "  The neutrino burst detected during supernova SN1987A is explained in a\nstrangeon star model, in which it is proposed that a pulsar-like compact object\nis composed of strangeons (strangeon: an abbreviation of \"strange nucleon\"). A\nnascent strangeon star's initial internal energy is calculated, with the\ninclusion of pion excitation (energy around 10^53 erg, comparable to the\ngravitational binding energy of a collapsed core). A liquid-solid phase\ntransition at temperature ~ 1-2 MeV may occur only a few ten-seconds after\ncore-collapse, and the thermal evolution of strangeon star is then modeled. It\nis found that the neutrino burst observed from SN 1987A could be re-produced in\nsuch a cooling model.\n", "  We use the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) data to perform a\nBayesian statistical analysis and discuss the observational viability of\ninflationary models with a non-minimal coupling,~$\\xi$, between the inflaton\nfield and the Ricci scalar. We particularize our analysis to two examples of\nsmall and large field inflationary models, namely, the Coleman-Weinberg and the\nchaotic quartic potentials. We find that (i) the $\\xi$ parameter is closely\ncorrelated with the primordial amplitude; (ii) although improving the agreement\nwith the CMB data in the $r - n_s$ plane, where $r$ is the tensor-to-scalar\nratio and $n_s$ the primordial spectral index, a non-null coupling is strongly\ndisfavoured with respect to the minimally coupled standard $\\Lambda$CDM model,\nsince the upper bounds of the Bayes factor (odds) for $\\xi$ parameter are\ngreater than $150:1$.\n", "  We present a fully-differential and high-precision calculation of top-quark\npair-production and decay at the LHC, providing predictions for observables\nconstructed from top-quark leptonic and $b$-flavoured jet final states. The\ncalculation is implemented in a parton-level Monte Carlo and includes an\napproximation to the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) corrections to the\nproduction and, for the first time, the exact NNLO corrections to the decay\nsubprocesses. The corrections beyond NLO are sizeable, and including them is\ncrucial for an accurate description of the cross section constrained by\nexperimental phase-space restrictions. We compare our predictions to published\nATLAS and CMS measurements at the LHC, finding improved agreement compared with\nlower orders in the perturbative expansion.\n", "  Results are presented for the time evolution of fermions initially in a\nnon-zero temperature normal phase, following the switch on of an attractive\ninteraction. The dynamics are studied in the disordered phase close to the\ncritical point, where the superfluid fluctuations are large. The analysis is\nconducted within a two-particle irreducible, large $N$ approximation. The\nsystem is considered from the perspective of critical quenches where it is\nshown that the fluctuations follow universal model A dynamics. A signature of\nthis universality is found in a singular correction to the fermion lifetime,\ngiven by a scaling form $t^{(3-d)/2}S_d(\\varepsilon^2 t)$, where $d$ is the\nspatial dimension, $t$ is the time since the quench, and $\\varepsilon$ is the\nfermion energy. The singular behavior of the spectral density is interpreted as\narising due to incoherent Andreev reflections off superfluid fluctuations.\n", "  In this manuscript we describe a hidden conformal symmetry of the second\nRandall-Sundrum model (RS2). We show how this can be used to localize fermions\nof both chiralities. The conformal symmetry leaves few free dimensionless\nconstants and constrains the allowed interactions. In this formulation the\nwarping of the extra dimension emerges from a partial breaking of the conformal\nsymmetry in five dimensions. The solution of the system can be described in two\nalternative gauges: by the metric or by the conformon. By considering this as a\nfundamental symmetry we construct a conformally invariant action for a vector\nfield which provides a massless photon localized over a Minkowski brane. This\nis obtained by a conformal non-minimal coupling that breaks the gauge symmetry\nin five dimensions. We further consider a generalization of the model by\nincluding conformally invariant torsion. By coupling torsion non-minimally to\nfermions we obtain a localized zero mode of both chiralities completing the\nconsistence of the model. The inclusion of torsion introduces a fermion quartic\ninteraction that can be used to probe the existence of large extra dimensions\nand the validity of the model. This seems to point to the fact that conformal\nsymmetry may be more fundamental than gauge symmetry and that this is the\nmissing ingredient for the full consistence of RS scenarios.\n", "  Studies of the formation and evolution of young stars and their disks rely on\nthe knowledge of the stellar parameters of the young stars. The derivation of\nthese parameters is commonly based on comparison with photospheric template\nspectra. Furthermore, chromospheric emission in young active stars impacts the\nmeasurement of mass accretion rates, a key quantity to study disk evolution.\nHere we derive stellar properties of low-mass pre-main sequence stars without\ndisks, which represent ideal photospheric templates for studies of young stars.\nWe also use these spectra to constrain the impact of chromospheric emission on\nthe measurements of mass accretion rates. The spectra in reduced,\nflux-calibrated, and corrected for telluric absorption form are made available\nto the community. We derive the spectral type for our targets by analyzing the\nphotospheric molecular features present in their VLT/X-Shooter spectra by means\nof spectral indices and comparison of the relative strength of photospheric\nabsorption features. We also measure effective temperature, gravity, projected\nrotational velocity, and radial velocity from our spectra by fitting them with\nsynthetic spectra with the ROTFIT tool. The targets have negligible extinction\nand spectral type from G5 to M8. We perform synthetic photometry on the spectra\nto derive the typical colors of young stars in different filters. We measure\nthe luminosity of the emission lines present in the spectra and estimate the\nnoise due to chromospheric emission in the measurements of accretion luminosity\nin accreting stars. We provide a calibration of the photospheric colors of\nyoung PMS stars as a function of their spectral type in a set of standard\nbroad-band optical and near-infrared filters. For stars with masses of ~\n1.5Msun and ages of ~1-5 Myr, the chromospheric noise converts to a limit of\nmeasurable mass accretion rates of ~ 3x10^-10 Msun/yr.\n", "  Here we prove the existence of a new type of the world-sheet string\nsingularities - the cusps that are stable during the finite time. These\nsingularities make the emission of the captured massive quantum particle\npossible in the frames of the author's model suggested earlier. In aggregate,\nwe have a new mechanism of quantum teleportation of such particles at large\ndistances.\n", "  (Abridged) Through spectrally unresolved observations of high-J CO\ntransitions, Herschel-PACS has revealed large reservoirs of warm (300 K) and\nhot (700 K) molecular gas around low-mass protostars. We aim to shed light on\nthe excitation and origin of the CO ladder observed toward protostars, and on\nthe water abundance in different physical components using spectrally resolved\nHerschel-HIFI data. Observations are presented of the highly excited CO line\nJ=16-15 with Herschel-HIFI toward 24 low-mass protostellar objects. The\nspectrally resolved profiles show two distinct velocity components: a broad\ncomponent with an average FWHM of 20 km/s, and a narrower component with a FWHM\nof 5 km/s that is often offset from the source velocity. The average rotational\ntemperature over the entire profile, as measured from comparison between CO\nJ=16-15 and 10-9 emission, is ~300 K. A radiative-transfer analysis shows that\nthe average H2O/CO column-density ratio is ~0.02, suggesting a total H2O\nabundance of ~2x10^-6. Two distinct velocity profiles observed in the HIFI line\nprofiles suggest that the CO ladder observed with PACS consists of two\nexcitation components. The warm component (300 K) is associated with the broad\nHIFI component, and the hot component (700 K) is associated with the offset\nHIFI component. The former originates in either outflow cavity shocks or the\ndisk wind, and the latter in irradiated shocks. The ubiquity of the warm and\nhot CO components suggests that fundamental mechanisms govern the excitation of\nthese components; we hypothesize that the warm component arises when H2 stops\nbeing the dominant coolant. In this scenario, the hot component arises in\ncooling molecular H2-poor gas just prior to the onset of H2 formation. High\nspectral resolution observations of highly excited CO transitions uniquely shed\nlight on the origin of warm and hot gas in low-mass protostellar objects.\n", "  Scattering amplitudes in a range of quantum field theories can be computed\nusing the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formalism. In theories with colour ordering,\nthe key ingredient is the so-called Parke-Taylor factor. In this note we give a\nfully $\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$-covariant definition and study the properties\nof a new integrand called the string Parke-Taylor factor. It has an $\\alpha'$\nexpansion whose leading coefficient is the field-theoretic Parke-Taylor factor.\nIts main application is that it leads to a CHY formulation of open string\ntree-level amplitudes. In fact, the definition of the string Parke-Taylor\nfactor was motivated by trying to extend the compact formula for the first\n$\\alpha'$ correction found by He and Zhang, while the main ingredient in its\ndefinition is a determinant of a matrix introduced in the context of string\ntheory by Stieberger and Taylor.\n", "  Relativistic jets associated with active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts\npropagate over huge distances without significant loss of momentum. At the same\ntime they are bright emitters, which is indicative of strong energy\ndissipation. This points towards a mechanism of internal dissipation which does\nnot result in a global disruption of the flow. One possibility is internal\nshocks and another one is turbulence driven by local instabilities. Such\ninstabilities can be triggered when a freely expanding jet is reconfined by\neither the cocoon or external gas pressure. In this paper we study the dynamics\nof two-component spine-sheath hydrodynamic jets coming into pressure\nequilibrium with external gas using 2D computer simulations. We find that the\njet oscillations lead to a rapid onset of Rayleigh-Taylor-type instabilities,\nwhich results in additional internal dissipation and mixing of the jet\ncomponents. Although slightly different in details, this outcome holds both for\nthe heavy-spine-light-sheath and light-spine-heavy-sheath configurations. The\nresults may provide an explanation to the spatial flaring observed in some AGN\njets on kpc-scales.\n", "  The existence of superfluidity of the neutron component in the core of a\nneutron star, associated specifically with triplet $P-$wave pairing, is\ncurrently an open question that is central to interpretation of the observed\ncooling curves and other neutron-star observables. Ab initio theoretical\ncalculations aimed at resolving this issue face unique challenges in the\nrelevant high-density domain, which reaches beyond the saturation density of\nsymmetrical nuclear matter. These issues include uncertainties in the\nthree-nucleon (3N) interaction and in the effects of strong short-range\ncorrelations -- and more generally of in-medium modification of nucleonic\nself-energies and interactions. A survey of existing solutions to the gap\nequations in the triplet channel shows that the separate or combined impacts of\n3N forces, coupled channels, and mass renormalization range from moderate to\nstrong to devastating, thus motivating a detailed analysis of the competing\neffects. In the present work we track the effects of the 3N force and in-medium\nmodifications in the representative case of the $^3P_2$ channel, based on the\nArgonne V18 two-nucleon (2N) interaction supplemented by 3N interactions of the\nUrbana IX family. Sensitivity of the results to the input interaction is\nclearly demonstrated, while consistency issues arise with respect to the\nsimultaneous treatment of 3N forces and in-medium effects. We consider this\npilot study as the first step towards a systematic and comprehensive\nexploration of coupled-channel $^3P F_2$ pairing using a broad range of 2N and\n3N interactions from the current generation of refined semi-phenomenological\nmodels and models derived from chiral effective field theory.\n", "  Recently a new method to discover obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by\nutilizing X-ray and Infrared data has been developed. We carried out a survey\nof H2O maser emission toward ten obscured AGNs with the Nobeyama 45-m\ntelescope. We newly detected the maser emission with the signal-noise-ratio\n(SNR) of above 4 from two AGNs, NGC 1402 and NGC 7738. We also found a\ntentative detection with its SNR > 3 in NGC 5037. The detection rate of 20% is\nhigher than those of previous surveys (usually several percents).\n", "  With SDO observations and a data-constrained MHD model, we identify a\nconfined multi-ribbon flare occurred on 2010 October 25 in solar active region\n11117 as a magnetic bald patch (BP) flare with strong evidences. From the\nphotospheric magnetic field observed by SDO/HMI, we find there is indeed\nmagnetic BPs on the PILs which match parts of the flare ribbons. From the 3D\ncoronal magnetic field derived from a MHD relaxation model constrained by the\nvector magnetograms, we find strikingly good agreement of the BP separatrix\nsurface (BPSS) footpoints with the flare ribbons, and the BPSS itself with the\nhot flaring loop system. Moreover, the triggering of the BP flare can be\nattributed to a small flux emergence under the lobe of the BPSS, and the\nrelevant change of the coronal magnetic field through the flare is well\nreproduced by the pre-flare and post-flare MHD solutions, which match the\ncorresponding pre and post-flare AIA observations, respectively. Our work\ncontributes to the study of non-typical flares that constitute the majority of\nsolar flares but cannot be explained by the standard flare model.\n", "  The star formation properties of early-type galaxies (ETGs) are currently the\nsubject of considerable interest, particularly whether they differ from those\nof gas-rich spirals. We perform a systematic study of star formation in a large\nsample of local ETGs using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and dust\nemission, focusing on the galaxies' star formation rates (SFRs) and star\nformation efficiencies (SFEs). Our sample is composed of the 260 ETGs from the\nATLAS3D survey, from which we use the cold gas measurements (HI and CO). The\nSFRs are estimated from stellar, PAH and dust fits to spectral energy\ndistributions created from new AKARI measurements and literature data from WISE\nand 2MASS. The mid-infrared luminosities of non-CO-detected galaxies are well\ncorrelated with their stellar luminosities, showing that they trace\n(circum)stellar dust emission. CO-detected galaxies show an excess above these\ncorrelations, uncorrelated with their stellar luminosities, indicating that\nthey likely contain PAHs and dust of interstellar origin. PAH and dust\nluminosities of CO-detected galaxies show tight correlations with their\nmolecular gas masses, and the derived current SFRs are typically 0.01-1\nMsun/yr. These SFRs systematically decrease with stellar age at fixed stellar\nmass, while they correlate nearly linearly with stellar mass at fixed age. The\nmajority of local ETGs follow the same star-formation law as local star-forming\ngalaxies, and their current SFEs do not depend on either stellar mass or age.\nOur results clearly indicate that molecular gas is fueling current star\nformation in local ETGs, that appear to acquire this gas via mechanisms\nregulated primarily by stellar mass. The current SFEs of local ETGs are similar\nto those of local star-forming galaxies, indicating that their low SFRs are\nlikely due to smaller cold gas fractions rather than a suppression of star\nformation.\n", "  A search is reported for a narrow vector resonance decaying to\nquark-antiquark pairs in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV,\ncollected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an\nintegrated luminosity of 2.7 inverse femtobarns. The vector resonance is\nproduced at large transverse momenta, with its decay products merged into a\nsingle jet. The resulting signature is a peak over background in the\ndistribution of the invariant mass of the jet. The results are interpreted in\nthe framework of a leptophobic vector resonance and no evidence is found for\nsuch particles in the mass range of 100-300 GeV. Upper limits at 95% confidence\nlevel on the production cross section are presented in a region of\nmass-coupling phase space previously unexplored at the LHC. The region below\n140 GeV has not been explored by any previous experiments.\n", "  Entropy is a fundamental concept in equilibrium statistical mechanics, yet\nits origin in the non-equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum systems is not\nfully understood. A strong consensus is emerging around the idea that the\nstationary thermodynamic entropy is the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a\nlarge subsystem embedded in an infinite system. Also motivated by cold-atom\nexperiments, here we consider the generalisation to Renyi entropies. We develop\na new technique to calculate the diagonal Renyi entropy in the quench action\nformalism. In the spirit of the replica treatment for the entanglement entropy,\nthe diagonal Renyi entropies are generalised free energies evaluated over a\nthermodynamic macrostate which depends on the Renyi index and, in particular,\nit is not the same describing the von Neumann entropy. The technical reason for\nthis, maybe surprising, result is that the evaluation of the moments of the\ndiagonal density matrix shifts the saddle point of the quench action. An\ninteresting consequence is that different Renyi entropies encode information\nabout different regions of the spectrum of the post-quench Hamiltonian. Our\napproach provides a very simple proof of the long-standing issue that, for\nintegrable systems, the diagonal entropy is half of the thermodynamic one and\nit allows us to generalise this result to the case of arbitrary Renyi entropy.\n", "  The physical reason why one can calculate with similar accuracy, as compared\nto the experimental data, the absolute cross section associated with\ntwo-nucleon transfer processes between members of pairing rotational bands,\nmaking use of simple BCS (constant matrix elements) or of many-body\n(Nambu-Gorkov (NG), nuclear field theory (NFT)) spectroscopic amplitudes, is\nnot immediately obvious. Restoration of spontaneous symmetry breaking and\nassociated emergent generalised rigidity in gauge space provides the answer,\nand points to a new emergence: a physical sum rule resulting from the\nintertwining of structure and reaction processes and closely connected with the\ncentral role induced pairing interaction plays in structure together with the\nfact that successive transfer dominates Cooper pair tunnelling.\n", "  We study the free boundary problem for the flow of a compressible isentropic\ninviscid elastic fluid. At the free boundary moving with the velocity of the\nfluid particles the columns of the deformation gradient are tangent to the\nboundary and the pressure vanishes outside the flow domain. We prove the\nlocal-in-time existence of a unique smooth solution of the free boundary\nproblem provided that among three columns of the deformation gradient there are\ntwo which are non-collinear vectors at each point of the initial free boundary.\nIf this non-collinearity condition fails, the local-in-time existence is proved\nunder the classical Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition satisfied at the first\nmoment. By constructing an Hadamard-type ill-posedness example for the frozen\ncoefficients linearized problem we show that the simultaneous failure of the\nnon-collinearity condition and the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition leads to\nRayleigh-Taylor instability.\n", "  We use lattice regularization to study the flow of the flavor-triplet fermion\ncurrent central charge $C^f_J$ from its free field value in the ultraviolet\nlimit to its conformal value in the infrared limit of the parity-invariant\nthree-dimensional QED with two flavors of two-component fermions. The\ndependence of $C^f_J$ on the scale is weak with a tendency to be below the free\nfield value at intermediate distances. Our numerical data suggests that the\nflavor-triplet fermion current and the topological current correlators become\ndegenerate within numerical errors in the infra-red limit, thereby supporting\nan enhanced O(4) symmetry predicted by strong self-duality. Further, we\ndemonstrate that fermion dynamics is necessary for the scale-invariant behavior\nof parity-invariant three-dimensional QED by showing that the pure gauge theory\nwith non-compact gauge action has non-zero bilinear condensate.\n", "  We analyze the morphologies of three core collapse supernova remnants\n(CCSNRs) and the energy of jets in other CCSNRs and in Super Luminous\nSupernovae (SLSNe) of type Ib/Ic/IIb, and conclude that these properties are\nwell explained by the last jets' episode as expected in the jet feedback\nexplosion mechanism of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The presence of two\nopposite protrusions, termed ears, and our comparison of the CCSNR morphologies\nwith morphologies of planetary nebulae strengthen the claim that jets play a\nmajor role in the explosion mechanism of CCSNe. We crudely estimate the energy\nthat was required to inflate the ears in two CCSNRs, and assume that the ears\nwere inflated by jets. We find that the energies of the jets that inflated ears\nin 11 CCSNRs span a range that is similar to that of jets in some energetic\nCCSNe (SLSNe), and that this energy, only of the last jets' episode, is much\nless than the explosion energy. This finding is compatible with the jet\nfeedback explosion mechanism of CCSNe, where only the last jets, that carry a\nsmall fraction of the total energy carried by earlier jets, are expected to\ninfluence the outer parts of the ejecta. We reiterate our call for a paradigm\nshift from neutrino-driven to jet-driven explosion models of CCSNe.\n", "  Organized Autotelescopes for Serendipitous Event Survey (OASES) is an optical\nobservation project that aims to detect and investigate stellar occultation\nevents by kilometer-sized trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). In this project,\nmultiple low-cost observation systems for wide-field and high-speed photometry\nwere developed in order to detect rare and short-timescale stellar occultation\nevents. The observation system consists of commercial off-the-shelf $0.28 \\\n{\\rm m}$ aperture $f/1.58$ optics providing a $2.3 \\times 1.8$ square-degree\nfield of view. A commercial CMOS camera is coupled to the optics to obtain\nfull-frame imaging with a frame rate greater than $10 \\ {\\rm Hz}$. As of\nSeptember 2016, this project exploits two observation systems, which are\ninstalled on Miyako Island, Okinawa, Japan. Recent improvements in CMOS\ntechnology in terms of high-speed imaging and low readout noise mean that the\nobservation systems are capable of monitoring $\\sim 2000$ stars in the Galactic\nplane simultaneously with magnitudes down to ${\\rm V} \\sim 13.0$, providing\n$\\sim 20\\%$ photometric precision in light curves with a sampling cadence of\n$15.4 \\ {\\rm Hz}$. This number of monitored stars is larger than for any other\nexisting instruments for coordinated occultation surveys. In addition, a\nprecise time synchronization method needed for simultaneous occultation\ndetection is developed using faint meteors. The two OASES observation systems\nare executing coordinated monitoring observations of a dense stellar field in\norder to detect occultations by kilometer-sized TNOs for the first time.\n", "  Recent results for the total and inelastic hadronic cross-sections from LHC\nexperiments are compared with predictions from a single channel PDF driven\neikonal mini-jet model and from an empirical model.\n  The role of soft gluon resummation in the infrared region in taming the rise\nof mini-jets and their contribution to the increase of the total cross-sections\nat high energies are discussed. Survival probabilities at LHC, whose\ntheoretical estimates range from circa 10 percent to a few per mille, will be\nestimated in this model and compared with results from QCD inspired models and\nfrom multi channel eikonal models. We revisit a previous calculation and\nexamine the origin of these discrepancies.\n", "  Two narrow and dense rings (called C1R and C2R) were discovered around the\nCentaur object (10199) Chariklo during a stellar occultation observed on 2013\nJune 3. Following this discovery, we planned observations of several\noccultations by Chariklo's system in order to better characterize the physical\nproperties of the ring and main body. Here, we use 12 successful occulations by\nChariklo observed between 2014 and 2016. They provide ring profiles (physical\nwidth, opacity, edge structure) and constraints on the radii and pole position.\nOur new observations are currently consistent with the circular ring solution\nand pole position, to within the $\\pm 3.3$ km formal uncertainty for the ring\nradii derived by Braga-Ribas et al. The six resolved C1R profiles reveal\nsignificant width variations from $\\sim 5$ to 7.5 km. The width of the fainter\nring C2R is less constrained, and may vary between 0.1 and 1 km. The inner and\nouter edges of C1R are consistent with infinitely sharp boundaries, with\ntypical upper limits of one kilometer for the transition zone between the ring\nand empty space. No constraint on the sharpness of C2R's edges is available. A\n1$\\sigma$ upper limit of $\\sim 20$ m is derived for the equivalent width of\nnarrow (physical width <4 km) rings up to distances of 12,000 km, counted in\nthe ring plane.\n", "  A wide variety of molecules have recently been detected in the Horsehead\nnebula photodissociation region (PDR) suggesting that: (i) gas-phase and grain\nchemistries should both contribute to the formation of organic molecules, and\n(ii) far-ultraviolet (FUV) photodesorption may explain the release into the gas\nphase of grain surface species. In order to tackle these specific problems and\nmore generally in order to better constrain the chemical structure of these\ntypes of environments we present a study of the Horsehead nebula gas-grain\nchemistry. To do so we used the 1D astrochemical gas-grain code Nautilus with\nan appropriate physical structure computed with the Meudon PDR Code and\ncompared our modeled outcomes with published observations and with previously\nmodeled results when available. The use of a large set of chemical reactions\ncoupled with the time-dependent code Nautilus allows us to reproduce most of\nthe observations well, including those of the first detections in a PDR of the\norganic molecules HCOOH, CH2CO, CH3CHO and CH3CCH, which are mostly associated\nwith hot cores. We also provide some abundance predictions for other molecules\nof interest. Understanding the chemistry behind the detection of these organic\nmolecules is crucial to better constrain the environments these molecules can\nprobe.\n", "  In this work we present an analytical gravitational self-force calculation of\nthe spin-orbit precession along an eccentric orbit around a Schwarzschild black\nhole, following closely the recent prescription of Akcay, Dempsey, and Dolan.\nWe then transcribe this quantity within the Effective-One-Body (EOB) formalism,\nthereby determining several new, linear-in-mass-ratio, contributions in the\npost-Newtonian expansion of the spin-orbit couplings entering the EOB\nHamiltonian. Namely, we determine the second gyro-gravitomagnetic ratio\n$g_{S_*}(r,p_r,p_{\\phi})$ up to order $p_r^2/r^4$ included.\n", "  The pre-main-sequence evolution of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs is studied\nnumerically starting from the formation of a protostellar/proto-brown dwarf\nseed and taking into account the mass accretion onto the central object during\nthe initial several Myr of evolution. The stellar evolution was computed using\nthe STELLAR evolution code developed by Yorke & Bodenheimer with recent\nmodifications by Hosokawa et al. The mass accretion rates were taken from\nnumerical hydrodynamics models of Vorobyov & Basu computing the circumstellar\ndisk evolution starting from the gravitational collapse of pre-stellar cloud\ncores of various mass and angular momentum. The resulting stellar evolution\ntracks were compared with the isochrones and isomasses calculated using\nnon-accreting models. We find that mass accretion in the initial several Myr of\nprotostellar evolution can have a strong effect on the subsequent evolution of\nyoung stars and brown dwarfs. The disagreement between accreting and\nnon-accreting models in terms of the total stellar luminosity L_st, stellar\nradius R_st and effective temperature T_eff depends on the thermal efficiency\nof accretion, i.e., on the fraction of accretion energy absorbed by the central\nobject. The largest mismatch is found for the cold accretion case, in which\nessentially all accretion energy is radiated away. The relative deviations in\nL_st and R_st in this case can reach 50% for 1.0-Myr-old objects and remain\nnotable even for 10-Myr-old objects. In the hot and hybrid accretion cases, in\nwhich a constant fraction of accretion energy is absorbed, the disagreement\nbetween accreting and non-accreting models becomes less pronounced, but still\nremains notable for 1.0-Myr-old objects. These disagreements may lead to the\nwrong age estimate for objects of (sub-)solar mass when using the isochrones\nbased on non-accreting models (abridged).\n", "  We studied the temperature and magnetic field dependence of vortex\ndissipation and critical current in the mixed-state of unconventional\nsuperconducting alloys Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ ($0.044 \\leq x \\leq\n0.100$) through current-voltage measurements. Our results reveal that all the\nelectric field $E$ vs current density $j$ curves in the Ohmic regime merge to\none point ($j_0,E_0$) and that there is a simple relationship between the\ncritical current density $j_c$ and flux-flow resistivity $\\rho_{\\rm ff}$:\n$\\rho_{\\rm ff}/\\rho_{\\rm n} = (1- j_{c}/j_{0})^{-1}$, where $\\rho_{\\rm\nn}=E_0/j_0$ is the normal-state resistivity just above the superconducting\ntransition. In addition, $E_0$ is positive for all five dopings, reflecting the\nabnormal behavior of the flux-flow resistivity $\\rho_{\\rm ff}$: it increases\nwith decreasing magnetic field. In contrast, $E_0$ is negative for the\nconventional superconductor Nb since, as expected, $\\rho_{\\rm ff}$ decreases\nwith decreasing magnetic field. Furthermore, in the under-doped and over-doped\nsingle crystals of Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$, the parameter $E_0$ remains\ntemperature independent, while it decreases with increasing temperature for the\nsingle crystals around optimal doping ($ 0.060\\leq x\\leq 0.072 $). This result\npoints to the co-existence of superconductivity with some other phase around\noptimal doping.\n", "  The 50 \\,kton\\, INO-ICAL is a proposed underground high energy physics\nexperiment at Theni, India ($9^{\\circ}57'N$, $77^{\\circ}16'E$) to study the\nneutrino oscillation parameters using atmospheric neutrinos. The Resistive\nPlate Chamber (RPC) has been chosen as the active detector element for the ICAL\ndetector. An experimental setup consisting of 12 layers of glass RPCs of size\n2\\,m\\,$\\times$\\,2\\,m has been built at IICHEP, Madurai to study the long term\nstability and performance of RPCs which are produced on a large scale in Indian\nindustry. In this paper, the studies on the performance of RPCs are presented\nalong with the angular distribution of muons at Madurai\n($9^{\\circ}56'N,78^{\\circ}00'E$ and Altitude $\\approx$\\,160\\,m from sea level).\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to explore a resolution for the Faint Young Sun\nParadox that has been mostly rejected by the community, namely the possibility\nof a somewhat more massive young Sun with a large mass loss rate sustained for\ntwo to three billion years. This would make the young Sun bright enough to keep\nboth the terrestrial and Martian oceans from freezing, and thus resolve the\nparadox. It is found that a large and sustained mass loss is consistent with\nthe well observed spin-down rate of Sun-like stars, and indeed may be required\nfor it. It is concluded that a more massive young Sun must be considered a\nplausible hypothesis.\n", "  We formulate point-particle effective field theory (PPEFT) for relativistic\nspin-half fermions interacting with a massive, charged finite-sized source\nusing a first-quantized effective field theory for the heavy compact object and\na second-quantized language for the lighter fermion with which it interacts.\nThis description shows how to determine the near-source boundary condition for\nthe Dirac field in terms of the relevant physical properties of the source, and\nreduces to the standard choices in the limit of a point source. Using a\nfirst-quantized effective description is appropriate when the compact object is\nsufficiently heavy, and is simpler than (though equivalent to) the effective\ntheory that treats the compact source in a second-quantized way. As an\napplication we use the PPEFT to parameterize the leading energy shift for the\nbound energy levels due to finite-sized source effects in a model-independent\nway, allowing these effects to be fit in precision measurements. Besides\ncapturing finite-source-size effects, the PPEFT treatment also efficiently\ncaptures how other short-distance source interactions can shift bound-state\nenergy levels, such as due to vacuum polarization (through the Uehling\npotential) or strong interactions for Coulomb bound states of hadrons, or any\nhypothetical new short-range forces sourced by nuclei.\n", "  Using single-crystal X-ray diffraction we characterise the 235\\,K\nincommensurate phase transition in the hybrid molecular framework\ntetraethylammonium silver(I) dicyanoargentate, [NEt$_4$]Ag$_3$(CN)$_4$. We\ndemonstrate the transition to involve spontaneous resolution of chiral\n[NEt$_4$]$^+$ conformations, giving rise to a state in which molecular\nchirality is incommensurately modulated throughout the crystal lattice. We\nrefer to this state as an incommensurate chirality density wave (XDW) phase,\nwhich represents a fundamentally new type of chiral symmetry breaking in the\nsolid state. Drawing on parallels to the incommensurate ferroelectric\ntransition of NaNO$_2$ we suggest the XDW state arises through coupling between\nacoustic (shear) and molecular rotoinversion modes. Such coupling is\nsymmetry-forbidden at the Brillouin zone centre but symmetry-allowed for small\nbut finite modulation vectors $\\mathbf q=[0,0,q_z]^\\ast$. The importance of\nlong-wavelength chirality modulations in the physics of this hybrid framework\nmay have implications for the generation of mesoscale chiral textures, as\nrequired for advanced photonic materials.\n", "  It was proposed that if a higher-derivative gravity is renormalizable, it\nimplies necessarily a finite Newtonian potential at the origin, but the reverse\nof this statement is not true. Here we show that the reverse is true when\ntaking into account the vDVZ discontinuity which states that the theory\nobtained from massive one by taking zero mass limit is not equivalent to the\ntheory obtained in the zero mass case. The surviving degree of freedom in the\nzero mass limit is an extra scalar which does not affect the light bending\nangle, but affects the Newtonian potential. This asserts that in order to make\nthe singularity cancellation, the number of massive ghost and healthy tensors\nmatches with that of massive ghost and healthy scalars.\n", "  Concentric cavities can lead to strong photon-atom coupling without a need\nfor high finesse or small physical-cavity volume. In a proof-of-principle\nexperiment of this concept we demonstrate coupling of single Rb atoms to a 11mm\nlong near-concentric cavity with a finesse F=138(2). Operating the cavity\n1.65(1)$\\mu$m shorter than the critical length, we observe an atom-cavity\ncoupling constant $g_0=2\\pi \\times 5.0(2)\\,$MHz which exceeds the natural\ndipole decay rate $\\gamma$ by a factor $g_0/\\gamma=1.7(1)$.\n", "  We analyze the flavor structure of composite vector bosons arising in a model\nof vectorlike technicolor, often called hypercolor (HC), with eight flavors\nthat form a one-family content of HC fermions. Dynamics of the composite vector\nbosons, referred to as HC rho in this paper, are formulated together with HC\npions by the hidden local symmetry (HLS), in a way analogous to QCD vector\nmesons. Then coupling properties to the standard model (SM) fermions, which\nrespect the HLS gauge symmetry, are described in a way that couplings of the HC\nrhos to the left-handed SM quarks and leptons are given by a well-defined setup\nas taking the flavor mixing structures into account. Under the present\nscenario, we discuss significant bounds on the model from electroweak precision\ntests, flavor physics, and collider physics. We also try to address B anomalies\nin processes such as B -> K(*) mu+ mu- and B -> D(*) tau nu, recently reported\nby LHCb, Belle, (ATLAS, and CMS in part.) Then we find that the present model\ncan account for the anomaly in B -> K(*) mu+ mu- consistently with the other\nconstraints while it predicts no significant deviations in B -> D(*) tau nu\nfrom the SM, which can be examined in the future Belle II experiment. The\nformer is archived with the form C9 = -C10 of the Wilson coefficients for\neffective operators of b -> s mu+ mu-, which has been favored by the recent\nexperimental data. We also investigate current and future experimental limits\nat the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and see that possible collider signals come\nfrom dijet and ditau, or dimuon resonant searches for the present scenario with\nTeV mass range. To conclude, the present b -> s mu+ mu- anomaly is likely to\nimply discovery of new vector bosons in the ditau or dimuon channel in the\ncontext of the HC rho model. Our model can be considered as a UV completion of\nconventional U(1)' model.\n", "  We consider the situation when the signal propagating through each arm of an\ninterferometer has a complicated multi-mode structure. We find the relation\nbetween the particle-entanglement and the possibility to surpass the shot-noise\nlimit of the phase estimation. Our results are general---they apply to pure and\nmixed states of identical and distinguishable particles (or combinations of\nboth), for a fixed and fluctuating number of particles. We also show that the\nmethod for detecting the entanglement often used in two-mode system can give\nmisleading results when applied to the multi-mode case.\n", "  We study Heterotic supergravity on Hyper-Kahler manifolds in the presence of\nnon-trivial warping and three form flux with Abelian bundles in the large\ncharge limit. We find exact, regular solutions for multi-centered\nGibbons-Hawking spaces and Atiyah-Hitchin manifolds. In the case of\nAtiyah-Hitchin, regularity requires that the circle at infinity is of the same\norder as the instanton number, which is taken to be large. Alternatively there\nmay be a non-trivial density of smeared five branes at the bolt.\n", "  We present a deep search for HI 21-cm emission from the gaseous halo of\nMessier 31 as part of Project AMIGA, a large program Hubble Space Telescope\nprogram to study the circumgalactic medium of the Andromeda galaxy. Our\nobservations with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telesope target sight lines to\n48 background AGNs, more than half of which have been observed in the\nultraviolet with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, with impact parameters $25\n\\lesssim \\rho \\lesssim 330$ kpc ($0.1 \\lesssim \\rho / R_{\\rm vir} \\lesssim\n1.1$). We do not detect any 21-cm emission toward these AGNs to limits of\n$N({\\rm HI}) \\approx 4 \\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($5\\sigma$, per 2 kpc diameter\nbeam). This column density corresponds to an optical depth of $\\sim2.5$ at the\nLyman limit, thus our observations overlap with absorption line studies of\nLyman limit systems at higher redshift. Our non-detections place a limit on the\ncovering factor of such optically-thick gas around M31 to $f_c < 0.051$ (at\n90\\% confidence) for $\\rho \\leq R_{\\rm vir}$. While individual clouds have\npreviously been found in the region between M31 and M33, the covering factor of\nstrongly optically-thick gas is quite small. Our upper limits on the covering\nfactor are consistent with expectations from recent cosmological \"zoom\"\nsimulations. Recent COS-Halos ultraviolet measurements of \\HI\\ absorption about\nan ensemble of galaxies at $z \\approx 0.2$ show significantly higher covering\nfactors within $\\rho \\lesssim 0.5 R_{\\rm vir}$ at the same $N({\\rm H I})$,\nalthough the metal ion-to-H I ratios appear to be consistent with those seen in\nM31.\n", "  A comparison study of world data for the structure function F2 for Iron, as\nmeasured by both charged lepton and neutrino scattering experiments, is\npresented. Consistency of results for both charged lepton and neutrino\nscattering is observed for the full global data set in the valence regime.\nConsistency is also observed at low x for the various neutrino data sets, as\nwell as for the charged lepton data sets, independently. However, data from the\ntwo probes exhibit differences on the order of 15% in the\nshadowing/anti-shadowing transition region where the Bjorken scaling variable x\nis < 0.15. This observation is indicative that neutrino probes of nucleon\nstructure might be sensitive to different nuclear effects than charged lepton\nprobes. Details and results of the data comparison are here presented.\n", "  We report the initial results of our high-cadence monitoring program on the\nradio jet in the active galaxy M87, obtained by the KVN and VERA Array (KaVA)\nat 22 GHz. This is a pilot study that preceded a larger KaVA-M87 monitoring\nprogram, which is currently ongoing. The pilot monitoring was mostly performed\nevery two to three weeks from December 2013 to June 2014, at a recording rate\nof 1 Gbps, obtaining the data for a total of 10 epochs. We successfully\nobtained a sequence of good quality radio maps that revealed the rich structure\nof this jet from <~1 mas to 20 mas, corresponding to physical scales\n(projected) of ~0.1-2 pc (or ~140-2800 Schwarzschild radii). We detected\nsuperluminal motions at these scales, together with a trend of gradual\nacceleration. The first evidence for such fast motions and acceleration near\nthe jet base were obtained from recent VLBA studies at 43 GHz, and the fact\nthat very similar kinematics are seen at a different frequency and time with a\ndifferent instrument suggests these properties are fundamental characteristics\nof this jet. This pilot program demonstrates that KaVA is a powerful VLBI array\nfor studying the detailed structural evolution of the M87 jet and also other\nrelativistic jets.\n", "  With an aim to shed light on the origin of Li anomaly observed in a small\nfraction of red giants, we carried out a spectroscopic study on the\nobservational characteristics of selected 20 bright Li-rich giants, in\ncomparison with a large number of normal late G-early K giants, where special\nattention was paid to clarifying any difference between two samples with\nrespect to stellar parameters, rotation, activity, kinematic properties, and\nchemical abundances of Li, Be, C, O, Na, S, and Zn). Our targets are roughly\ndivided into 'bump/clump group' and 'luminous group' according to the position\non the HR diagram. Regarding the former group, Li-enriched giants and the\ncorresponding normal giants appear practically similar except for Li,\nsuggesting that surface Li enhancement in this group may be a transient episode\nwhich normal giants undergo at some certain evolutionary stage. Meanwhile,\nthose Li-rich giants belonging to the latter group appear more anomalous in the\nsense that they tend to show larger rotational velocities, and that their\nelemental abundances (e.g., those of C and O derived from high-excitation\nlines) are apt to show apparent overabundances, though this might be due to\nsome spurious effect reflecting the difficulty of abundance derivation in stars\nof higher rotation and activity. Our analysis confirmed considerable Be\ndeficiency as well as absence of 6Li as the general characteristics of Li-rich\ngiants under study, which implies that engulfment of planets is rather unlikely\nfor the cause of Li-enrichment.\n", "  The predicted orbital-period distribution of the subdwarf-B (sdB) population\nis bi-modal with a peak at short (< 10 days) and long (> 500 days) periods.\nObservationally, many short-period sdB systems are known, but only few wide sdB\nbinaries have been studied in detail. Based on a long-term monitoring program\nthe wide sdB sample has been increased, finding an unexpected correlation\nbetween the eccentricity and period. In this article we present the orbital\nsolution and spectral analysis of four new systems, BD-7.5977, EC11031-1348,\nTYC2084-448-1 and TYC3871-835-1, and update the orbital solution of PG1104+243.\nUsing the whole sample of wide sdBs, we aim at finding possible correlations\nbetween orbital and spectral properties, with as goal improving theoretical\nmodels of Roche-lobe overflow. High-resolution spectra were obtained to\ndetermine the radial velocities of both the sdB and MS components. Surface\ngravities and temperatures of both component were derived from photometric\nspectral-energy distributions. Spectral parameters of the cool companion were\nverified using the GSSP code. Furthermore the amount of accreted mass was\nestimated. Orbital parameters matching the earlier observed period-eccentricity\nrelation were found for three systems, while TYC 2084-448-1 is found to have a\nlower eccentricity than expected from the period-eccentricity trend indicated\nby the other systems. Based on new observations, the orbit of PG 1104+243 has a\nsmall but significant eccentricity of 0.04 $\\pm$ 0.02, matching other systems\nwith similar periods. Furthermore, a correlation between accreted mass and\norbital period was found, as well as a possible relation between the initial\nmass-ratio and the final period-eccentricity. The wide sdB-binary sample shows\ninteresting possible correlations between orbital and spectral properties.\nHowever, a larger sample is necessary to statistically validate them.\n", "  We numerically construct static localized black holes in five and six\nspacetime dimensions which are solutions to Einstein's vacuum field equations\nwith one compact periodic dimension. In particular, we investigate the critical\nregime in which the poles of the localized black hole are about to merge. A\nwell adapted multi-domain pseudo-spectral scheme provides us with accurate\nresults and enables us to investigate the phase diagram of those localized\nsolutions within the critical regime, which goes far beyond previous results.\nWe find that in this regime the phase diagram possesses a spiral structure\nadapting to the one recently found for non-uniform black strings. When\napproaching the common endpoint of both phases, the behavior of physical\nquantities is described by complex critical exponents giving rise to a discrete\nscaling symmetry. The numerically obtained values of the critical exponents\nagree remarkably well with those derived from the double-cone metric.\n", "  Local domain structures of ferroelectrics have been studied extensively using\nvarious modes of scanning probes at the nanoscale, including piezoresponse\nforce microscopy (PFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), though none of\nthese techniques measure the polarization directly, and the fast formation\nkinetics of domains and screening charges cannot be captured by these\nquasi-static measurements. In this study, we used charge gradient microscopy\n(CGM) to image ferroelectric domains of lithium niobate based on current\nmeasured during fast scanning, and applied principal component analysis (PCA)\nto enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of noisy raw data. We found that the CGM\nsignal increases linearly with the scan speed while decreases with the\ntemperature under power-law, consistent with proposed imaging mechanisms of\nscraping and refilling of surface charges within domains, and polarization\nchange across domain wall. We then, based on CGM mappings, estimated the\nspontaneous polarization and the density of surface charges with order of\nmagnitude agreement with literature data. The study demonstrates that PCA is a\npowerful method in imaging analysis of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), with\nwhich quantitative analysis of noisy raw data becomes possible.\n", "  We analytically study a scattering of long linear surface waves on stationary\ncurrents in a duct (canal) of constant depth and variable width. It is assumed\nthat the background velocity linearly increases or decreases with the\nlongitudinal coordinate due to the gradual variation of duct width. Such a\nmodel admits analytical solution of the problem in hand, and we calculate the\nscattering coefficients as functions of incident wave frequency for all\npossible cases of sub-, super-, and trans-critical currents. For completeness\nwe study both co-current and counter-current wave propagation in accelerating\nand decelerating currents. The results obtained are analysed in application to\nrecent analog gravity experiments and shed light on the problem of hydrodynamic\nmodelling of Hawking radiation.\n", "  We consider heat transport through systems with broken time-reversal\nsymmetry. We apply strong magnetic fields to weakly charged particle systems,\nwhere the dynamics are dominated by the Lorentz force and spring forces. The\nstandard momentum conservation is not satisfied and the sound wave disappears\ndepending on the charge structure. We introduce an exactly solvable model and\ndemonstrate the appearance of a new universality class. The absence of sound\nwaves affects the relation between equilibrium correlation and the diverging\nthermal conductivity in the open system.\n", "  Correlators in conformal field theory are naturally organized as a sum over\nconformal blocks. In holographic theories, this sum must reorganize into a path\nintegral over bulk fields and geometries. We explore how these two sums are\nrelated in the case of a point particle moving in the background of a 3d\ncollapsing black hole. The conformal block expansion is recast as a sum over\npaths of the first-quantized particle moving in the bulk geometry. Off-shell\nworldlines of the particle correspond to subdominant contributions in the\nEuclidean conformal block expansion, but these same operators must be included\nin order to correctly reproduce complex saddles in the Lorentzian theory.\nDuring thermalization, a complex saddle dominates under certain circumstances;\nin this case, the CFT correlator is not given by the Virasoro identity block in\nany channel, but can be recovered by summing heavy operators. This effectively\nconverts the conformal block expansion in CFT from a sum over intermediate\nstates to a sum over channels that mimics the bulk path integral.\n", "  We investigate the nuclear environment of galaxies with observed 22 GHz water\nmegamaser in their subparsec edge-on accretion disks, using 33 GHz (9mm) radio\ncontinuum data from VLA, with a resolution of ~ 0.2-0.5 arcsecs, and relate the\nmaser and host galaxy properties to those of its radio continuum emission.\nEighty-seven percent (21 out of 24) galaxies in our sample show 33 GHz radio\ncontinuum emission at levels of 4.5-240 $\\sigma$. Five sources show extended\nemission, including one source with two main components and one with three main\ncomponents. The remaining detected 16 sources exhibit compact cores within the\nsensitivity limits. Little evidence is found for extended jets (>300 pc) in\nmost sources. Either they do not exist, or our chosen frequency of 33 GHz is\ntoo high for a detection of these supposedly steep spectrum features. In only\none source among those with known maser disk orientation, NGC4388, we found an\nextended jet-like feature that appears to be oriented perpendicular to the\nwater megamaser disk. Smaller 100-300 pc sized jets might also be present, as\nis suggested by the beam-deconvolved morphology of our sources. Whenever\npossible, central positions with accuracies of 20-280 mas are provided. A\ncorrelation analysis shows that the 33 GHz luminosity weakly correlates with\nthe infrared luminosity. The 33 GHz luminosity is anticorrelated with the\ncircular velocity of the galaxy. The black hole masses show stronger\ncorrelations with water maser luminosity than with 1.4 GHz, 33 GHz, or hard\nX-ray luminosities. Furthermore, the inner radii of the disks show stronger\ncorrelations with 1.4 GHz, 33 GHz, and hard X-ray luminosities than their outer\nradii, suggesting that the outer radii may be affected by disk warping, star\nformation, or peculiar density distributions.\n", "  Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) explores the first few minutes of nuclei\nformation after the Big Bang. We present updates that result in new constraints\nat the 2{\\sigma} level for the abundances of the four primary light nuclides -\nD,3He,4He, and 7Li - in BBN. A modified standard BBN code was used in a Monte\nCarlo analysis of the nucleosynthesis uncertainty as a function of\nbaryon-to-photon ratio. Reaction rates were updated to those of NACRE and\nREACLIB, and R-Matrix calculations. The results are then used to derive a new\nconstraint on the effective number of neutrinos.\n", "  We investigate the scattering of a quantum particle with a two-dimensional\n(2D) Rashba spin-orbit coupled dispersion off of circularly symmetric\npotentials. As the energy of the particle approaches the bottom of the lowest\nspin-split band, i.e., the van Hove singularity, earlier work has shown that\nscattering off of an infinite circular barrier exhibits a number of features\nunusual from the point of view of conventional 2D scattering theory: the\nlow-energy S-matrix is independent of the range of the potential, all partial\nwaves contribute equally, the differential cross section becomes increasingly\nanisotropic and 1D-like, and the total cross section exhibits quantized\nplateaus. Via a nonperturbative determination of the T-matrix and an optical\ntheorem which we prove here, we show that this behavior is universal for Rashba\nscattering off of any circularly symmetric, spin independent, finite-range\npotential. This is relevant both for impurity scattering in the noninteracting\nlimit as well as for short-range two-particle scattering in the interacting\nproblem.\n", "  Primordial nucleosynthesis remains as one of the pillars of modern cosmology.\nIt is the testing ground upon which many cosmological models must ultimately\nrest. It is our only probe of the universe during the important\nradiation-dominated epoch in the first few minutes of cosmic expansion. This\nchapter reviews the basic equations of space-time, cosmology, and big bang\nnucleosynthesis. We also summarize the current state of observational\nconstraints on primordial abundances along with the key nuclear reactions and\ntheir uncertainties. We summarize which nuclear measurements are most crucial\nduring the big bang. We also review various cosmological models and their\nconstraints. In particular, we analyze the constraints that big bang\nnucleosynthesis places upon the possible time variation of fundamental\nconstants, along with constraints on the nature and origin of dark matter and\ndark energy, long-lived supersymmetric particles, gravity waves, and the\nprimordial magnetic field.\n", "  We review important reactions in the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) model\ninvolving a long-lived negatively charged massive particle, $X^-$, which is\nmuch heavier than nucleons. This model can explain the observed $^7$Li\nabundances of metal-poor stars, and predicts a primordial $^9$Be abundance that\nis larger than the standard BBN prediction. In the BBN epoch, nuclei recombine\nwith the $X^-$ particle. Because of the heavy $X^-$ mass, the atomic size of\nbound states $A_X$ is as small as the nuclear size. The nonresonant\nrecombination rates are then dominated by the $d$-wave $\\rightarrow$ 2P\ntransition for $^7$Li and $^{7,9}$Be. The $^7$Be destruction occurs via a\nrecombination with the $X^-$ followed by a proton capture, and the primordial\n$^7$Li abundance is reduced. Also, the $^9$Be production occurs via the\nrecombination of $^7$Li and $X^-$ followed by deuteron capture. The initial\nabundance and the lifetime of the $X^-$ particles are constrained from a BBN\nreaction network calculation. We estimate that the derived parameter region for\nthe $^7$Li reduction is allowed in supersymmetric or Kaluza-Klein (KK) models.\nWe find that either the selectron, smuon, KK electron or KK muon could be\ncandidates for the $X^-$ with $m_X\\sim {\\mathcal O}(1)$ TeV, while the stau and\nKK tau cannot.\n", "  Photoevaporation is an important dispersal mechanism for protoplanetary\ndisks. We conduct hydrodynamic simulations coupled with ray-tracing radiative\ntransfer and consistent thermochemistry to study photoevaporative winds driven\nby ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the host star. Most models have a\nthree-layer structure: a cold midplane, warm intermediate layer, and hot wind,\nthe last having typical speeds $\\sim 30~\\mathrm{km\\ s}^{-1}$ and mass-loss\nrates $\\sim 10^{-9}~M_\\odot~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ when driven primarily by ionizing\nUV radiation. Observable molecules including CO, OH and H2O re-form in the\nintermediate layer and survive at relatively high wind temperatures due to\nreactions being out of equilibrium. Mass-loss rates are sensitive to the\nintensity of radiation in energy bands that interact directly with hydrogen.\nComparison with previous works shows that mass loss rates are also sensitive to\nthe treatment of both the hydrodynamics and the thermochemistry. Divergent\nresults concerning the efficiency of X-ray photoevaporation are traced in part\nto differing assumptions about dust and other coolants.\n", "  An efficient way for the control of spin wave propagation in a magnetic\nmedium is the use of periodic patterns known as magnonic crystals (MCs).\nHowever, the fabrication of MCs especially bi-components, with periodicity on\nnanoscale, is a challenging task due to the requirement for sharp interfaces.\nAn alternative method to circumvent this problem is to use homogeneous\nferromagnetic film with modified periodically surrounding. The structure is\nalso suitable for exploiting nonreciprocal properties of the surface spin\nwaves. In this work, we demonstrate that the magnonic band structure forms in\nthin permalloy film due to dynamical magnetostatic coupling with Ni stripes\nnear its surface. We show, that the band gap width can be systematically tuned\nby the changing interlayer thickness between film and stripes. We show also the\neffect of nonreciprocity, which is seen at the band gap edge shifted from the\nBrillouin zone boundary and also in nonreciprocal interaction of propagating\nspin waves in Py film with the standing spin waves in Ni stripes. Our findings\nopen possibility for further investigation and exploitation of the\nnonreciprocity and band structure in magnonic devices.\n", "  We study the effect of the instantaneous gas expulsion on star clusters\nwherein the residual gas has a density profile shallower than that of the\nembedded cluster. This is expected if star formation proceeds with a given SFE\nper free-fall time in a centrally-concentrated molecular clump. We perform\ndirect N-body simulations whose initial conditions are generated by the program\n\"mkhalo\" \"falcON\" adapted for our models. Our model clusters initially have a\nPlummer profile and are in virial equilibrium with the gravitational potential\nof the cluster-forming clump. The residual gas contribution is computed based\non the model of Parmentier&Pfalzner(2013). Our simulations include mass loss by\nstellar evolution and the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that a star\ncluster with a minimum global SFE of 15% is able to survive instantaneous gas\nexpulsion and to produce a bound cluster. Its violent relaxation lasts no\nlonger than 20 Myr, independently of its global SFE and initial stellar mass.\nAt the end of violent relaxation the bound fractions of surviving clusters with\nthe same global SFEs are similar regardless of their initial stellar mass.\nTheir subsequent lifetime in the gravitational field of the Galaxy depends on\ntheir bound stellar masses. We therefore conclude that the critical SFE needed\nto produce a bound cluster is 15%, which is twice smaller than earlier\nestimates of 33%. Thus we have improved the survival likelihood of young\nclusters after instantaneous gas expulsion. Those can now survive instantaneous\ngas expulsion with global SFEs as low as those observed for embedded clusters\nof Solar Neighbourhood (15-30%). This is the consequence of the star cluster\nhaving a density profile steeper than that of the residual gas. However, in\nterms of the effective SFE, measured by the virial ratio of the cluster at gas\nexpulsion, our results are in agreement with previous studies.\n", "  We study corrections to the soft graviton theorem at all loop orders in\nYukawa and scalar theories, both in the high energy and low energy regions. It\nis found that the tree level soft theorem is corrected by matrix elements\ncoupled to the Riemann curvature tensor of linearized gravity. Further\ncorrections appear in the high energy region and we develop a power counting\ntechnique to classify all such loop corrections according to their order of\nmagnitude. This leads to the construction of factorized contributions to the\nsoft theorem, to which we apply an analysis analogous to Low's theorem based on\nthe gravitational Ward identity. In this analysis, we emphasize the role played\nby the external kinematics.\n", "  We present the first NLO QCD+EW predictions for Higgs boson production in\nassociation with a l nu or l+ l- pair plus zero or one jets at the LHC.\nFixed-order NLO QCD+EW calculations are combined with a QCD+QED parton shower\nusing the recently developed resonance-aware method in the POWHEG framework.\nMoreover, applying the improved MINLO technique to H l nu and H l+ l-\nproduction at NLO QCD+EW, we obtain predictions that are NLO accurate for\nobservables with both zero or one resolved jet. This approach permits also to\ncapture higher-order effects associated with the interplay of EW corrections\nand QCD radiation. The behavior of EW corrections is studied for various\nkinematic distributions, relevant for experimental analyses of Higgsstrahlung\nprocesses at the 13 TeV LHC. Exact NLO EW corrections are complemented with\napproximate analytic formulae that account for the leading and next-to-leading\nSudakov logarithms in the high-energy regime. In the tails of\ntransverse-momentum distributions, relevant for analyses in the boosted Higgs\nregime, the Sudakov approximation works well, and NLO EW effects can largely\nexceed the ten percent level. Our predictions are based on the POWHEX BOX RES +\nOpenLoops framework in combination with the Pythia 8.1 parton shower.\n", "  Random number has many applications, it plays an important role in quantum\ninformation processing. It's not difficult to generate true random numbers, the\nmain difficulty is how to certify the random numbers generated by untrusted\ndevices. In [Nature(London) 464, 1021 (2010)], the authors provided us a way to\ngenerate certified random number by Bell's theorem. In their scheme, we can use\nthe nonlocal behavior of entangled states to generate certified randomness. But\nthere are entangled states, which admit a local hidden variable model, could\nnot be used in their scheme. We show in our paper that the nonlocal\ncorrelations in every entangled state can be used to generate certified\nrandomness, and we use Werner states as an example to show how to quantify the\noutput randomness.\n", "  We study production of primordial black holes (PBHs) during an early\nmatter-dominated phase. As a source of perturbations, we consider either the\ninflaton field with a running spectral index or a spectator field that has a\nblue spectrum and thus provides a significant contribution to the PBH\nproduction at small scales. First, we identify the region of the parameter\nspace where a significant fraction of the observed dark matter can be produced,\ntaking into account all current PBH constraints. Then, we present constraints\non the amplitude and spectral index of the spectator field as a function of the\nreheating temperature. We also derive constraints on the running of the\ninflaton spectral index, ${\\rm d}n/{\\rm d}{\\rm ln}k \\lesssim -0.002$, which are\ncomparable to those from the Planck satellite for a scenario where the\nspectator field is absent.\n", "  Recent studies of melting in hard disks have confirmed the existence of a\nhexatic phase occurring in a narrow window of density which is separated from\nthe isotropic liquid phase by a first-order transition, and from the solid\nphase by a continuous transition. However, little is known concerning the\nmelting scenario in mixtures of hard disks. Here we employ specialized Monte\nCarlo simulations to elucidate the phase behavior of a system of large ($l$)\nand small ($s$) disks with diameter ratio $\\sigma_l/\\sigma_s=1.4$. We find that\nas small disks are added to a system of large ones, the stability window of the\nhexatic phase shrinks progressively until the line of continuous transitions\nterminates at an end point beyond which melting becomes a first-order\nliquid-solid transition. This occurs at surprisingly low concentrations of the\nsmall disks, $c\\lesssim 1\\%$, emphasizing the fragility of the hexatic phase.\nWe speculate that the change to the melting scenario is a consequence of strong\nfractionation effects, the nature of which we elucidate.\n", "  Planck scale inspired theories which are also often accompanied with maximum\nenergy and/or momentum scale predict deformed dispersion relations compared to\nordinary special relativity and quantum mechanics. In this paper we resort to\nthe methods of statistical mechanics in order to determine the effects of a\ndeformed dispersion relation along with upper bound in partition function as\nmaximum energy and/or momentum scale can have on the thermodynamics of photon\ngas. We have analyzed two distinct quantum gravity models in this paper\n", "  Mass, metallicity, and star formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy are crucial\nparameters in understanding galaxy formation and evolution. However, the\nrelation among these is still a matter of debate for luminous infrared\ngalaxies, which carry a bulk of SFR budget of the universe at $z\\sim1$. We have\ninvestigated the relation among stellar mass, gas-phase oxygen abundance, and\nSFR of AKARI-detected mid-IR galaxies at $z\\sim0.88$ in the AKARI NEP deep\nfield. We observed about 350 AKARI sources with Subaru/FMOS NIR spectrograph,\nand detected secure and expected H$\\alpha$ emission lines from 25 and 44\ngalaxies, respectively. The SFR of our sample is almost constant ($\\sim\n25M_{\\odot}/yr$) over the stellar mass range of our sample. Compared with\nmain-sequence (MS) galaxies at a similar redshift range, the average SFR of our\ndetected sample is comparable for massive galaxies\n($\\sim10^{10.58}~M_{\\odot}$), while higher by $\\sim$0.6dex for less massive\ngalaxies ($\\sim 10^{10.05}~M_{\\odot}$). We measure metallicities from the\n[NII]/H$\\alpha$ emission line ratio.\n  We find that the mass-metallicity relation of our individually measured\nsources agrees with that for optical-selected star-forming galaxies at\n$z\\sim0.1$, while metallicities of stacked spectra agree with that of MS\ngalaxies at $z\\sim0.78$. Considering high SFR of individually measured sources,\nFMR of the IR galaxies is different from that at $z\\sim0.1$. However, on the\nmass-metallicity plane, they are consistent with the MS galaxies, highlighting\nhigher SFR of the IR galaxies. This suggests the evolutionary path of our IR\ngalaxies is different from that of MS galaxies. A possible physical\ninterpretation includes that the star-formation activities of IR galaxies at\n$z\\sim0.88$ in our sample are enhanced by interaction and/or merger of\ngalaxies, but the inflow of metal-poor gas is not yet induced, keeping the\nmetallicity intact.\n", "  Multiplex networks are a type of multilayer network in which entities are\nconnected to each other via multiple types of connections. We propose a method,\nbased on computing pairwise similarities between layers and then doing\ncommunity detection, for grouping structurally similar layers in multiplex\nnetworks. We illustrate our approach using both synthetic and empirical\nnetworks, and we are able to find meaningful groups of layers in both cases.\nFor example, we find that airlines that are based in similar geographic\nlocations tend to be grouped together in an airline multiplex network and that\nrelated research areas in physics tend to be grouped together in an multiplex\ncollaboration network.\n", "  An new and accurate scheme to calculate the interatomic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction (DMI) parameters is presented, which is based on the fully\nrelativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function (KKR-GF) technique.\nCorresponding numerical results are compared with those obtained using other\nschemes reported in the literature.\n  The differences found can be attributed primarily to the different reference\nstates used in the various approaches. In addition an expression for the DMI\nparameters formulated for a micromagnetic model Hamiltonian is presented that\nprovides a connection to the DMI parameters calculated for atomistic\nHamiltonians. This formulation also allows the discussion of the DMI in terms\nof specific features of the electronic band structure.\n", "  This article introduces the \"Goldilocks model\" for a few repulsively\ninteracting particles trapped in a one-dimensional harmonic well and provides\nexact solutions for the three-particle case. The Goldilocks model shares\nfeatures with two other well-known systems, the Calogero model and the\ncontact-interaction model, and coincides with them in limiting cases. However,\nthose models have purely two-body interactions whereas this model has\nintrinsically few-body interactions. Comparing these three models provides\nclarifying distinctions among the properties of symmetry, separability and\nintegrability. The model's analytic solutions provide a useful basis to improve\napproximation schemes, especially near the unitary limit of hard-core contact\ninteractions.\n", "  For a new sample of 8 weak-line-quasars (WLQs) we report a sensitive search\nin 20 intranight monitoring sessions, for blazar-like optical flux variations\non hour-like and longer time scale (day/month/year$-$like). The sample consists\nexclusively of the WLQs that are not radio$-$loud and have either been\nclassified as `radio-weak probable BL Lac candidates' and/or are known to have\nexhibited at least one episode of large, blazar$-$like optical variability.\nWhereas only a hint of intra$-$night variability is seen for two of these WLQs,\nJ104833.5$+$620305.0(z = 0.219) and J133219.6$+$622715.9 (z = 3.15),\nstatistically significant inter$-$night variability at a few per cent level is\ndetected for three of the sources, including the radio-intermediate WLQ\nJ133219.6$+$622715.9 (z = 3.15) and the well known bona$-$fide radio$-$quiet\nWLQs J121221.5$+$534128.0 (z = 3.10) and WLQ J153259.9$-$003944.1 (z = 4.62).\nIn the rest$-$frame, this variability is intra-day and in the far$-$UV band. On\nthe time scale of a decade, we find for three of the WLQs large brightness\nchanges, amounting to 1.655$\\pm$0.009, 0.163$\\pm$0.010 and 0.144$\\pm$0.018 mag,\nfor J104833.5$+$620305.0, J123743.1$+$630144.9 and J232428.4$+$144324.4,\nrespectively. Whereas the latter two are confirmed radio-quiet WLQs, the\nextragalactic nature of J104833.5$+$620305.0 remains to be well established,\nthanks to the absence of any feature(s) in its available optical spectra. The\npresent study forms a part of our ongoing campaign of intranight optical\nmonitoring of radio quiet weak-line quasars, in order to improve the\nunderstanding of this enigmatic class of Active Galactic Nuclei and to look\namong them for a possible tiny, elusive population of radio-quiet BL Lacs.\n", "  The lifetimes of the $2^+_1$, the $2^+_2$ and the $3^-_1$ states of\n$^{210}$Po have been measured in the $^{208}$Pb($^{12}$C,$^{10}$Be)$^{210}$Po\ntransfer reaction by the Doppler-shift attenuation method. The results for the\nlifetime of the $2^+_1$ state is about three times shorter than the adopted\nvalue. However, the new value still does not allow for consistent description\nof the properties of the yrast $2^+_1$, $4^+_1$, $6^+_1$, and $8^+_1$ states of\n$^{210}$Po in the framework of nuclear shell models. The Quasi-particle Phonon\nModel (QPM) calculations also cannot overcome this problem thus indicating the\nexistence of a peculiarity which is neglected in both theoretical approaches.\n", "  We present a study of AGN feedback at higher redshifts ($0.3<z<1.2$) using\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) selected samples of clusters from the South-Pole\nTelescope and Atacama Cosmology Telescope surveys. In contrast to studies of\nnearby systems, we do not find a separation between cooling flow clusters and\nnon-cooling flow clusters based on the radio luminosity of the central radio\nsource. This lack may be due to the increased incidence of galaxy-galaxy\nmergers at higher redshift that triggers AGN activity. In support of this\nscenario, we find evidence for evolution in the radio luminosity function of\nthe central radio source: while the lower-luminosity sources do not evolve\nmuch, the higher-luminosity sources show a strong increase in the frequency of\ntheir occurrence at higher redshifts. We interpret this evolution as an\nincrease in high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) in massive clusters at\n$z>0.6$, implying a transition from HERG-mode accretion to lower-power\nlow-excitation radio galaxy (LERG)-mode accretion at intermediate redshifts.\nAdditionally, we use local radio-to-jet power scaling relations to estimate\nfeedback power and find that half of the cooling flow systems in our sample\nprobably have enough heating to balance cooling. However, we postulate that the\nlocal relations are likely not well suited to predict feedback power in\nhigh-luminosity HERGs, as they are derived from samples composed mainly of\nlower-luminosity LERGs.\n", "  We conducted simple experiment and numerical simulation of two-dimensional\ngranular discharge flow driven by gravity under the influence of an obstacle.\nAccording to the previous work (Zuriguel {\\it et\nal.,\\,Phys.\\,Rev.\\,Lett.}\\,{\\bf 107}: 278001, 2011), the clogging of granular\ndischarge flow can be suppressed by putting a circular obstacle at a proper\nposition. In order to investigate the details of obstacle effect in granular\nflow, we focused on particle dynamics in this study. From the experimental and\nnumerical data, we found that the obstacle remarkably affects the\nhorizontal-velocity distribution and packing fraction at the vicinity of the\nexit. In addition to the circular obstacle, we utilized triangular,\ninverted-triangular, and horizontal-bar obstacles to discuss the obstacle-shape\neffect in granular discharge flow. Based on the investigation of dynamical\nquantities such as velocity distributions, granular temperature, and volume\nfraction, we found that the triangular obstacle or horizontal bar could be very\neffective to prevent the clogging. From the obtained result, we consider that\nthe detouring of particles around the obstacle and resultant low packing\nfraction at the exit region effectively prevent the clogging in a certain class\nof granular discharge flow.\n", "  The left-right chiral and ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic double spin-glass\nclock model, with the crucially even number of states q=4 and in three\ndimensions d=3, has been studied by renormalization-group theory. We find, for\nthe first time to our knowledge, four different spin-glass phases, including\nconventional, chiral, and quadrupolar spin-glass phases, and phase transitions\nbetween spin-glass phases. The chaoses, in the different spin-glass phases and\nin the phase transitions of the spin-glass phases with the other spin-glass\nphases, with the non-spin-glass ordered phases, and with the disordered phase,\nare determined and quantified by Lyapunov exponents. It is seen that the chiral\nspin-glass phase is the most chaotic spin-glass phase. The calculated phase\ndiagram is also otherwise very rich, including regular and temperature-inverted\ndevil's staircases and reentrances.\n", "  Several types of foreshock transients upstream of Earth's bow shock\npossessing a tenuous, hot core have been observed and simulated. Because of the\nlow dynamic pressure in their cores, these phenomena can significantly disturb\nthe bow shock and the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. Recent observations have\nalso demonstrated that foreshock transients can accelerate particles which,\nwhen transported earthward, can affect space weather. Understanding the\npotential of foreshock transients to accelerate particles can help us\nunderstand shock acceleration at Earth and at other planetary and astrophysical\nsystems. To further investigate foreshock transients' potential for\nacceleration we conduct a statistical study of ion and electron energization in\nthe core of foreshock transients. We find that electron energies typically\nincrease there, evidently due to an internal acceleration process, whereas, as\nexpected, ion energies most often decrease to support transient formation and\nexpansion. Nevertheless, ion energy enhancements can be seen in some events\nsuggesting an internal ion acceleration process as well. Formation conditions\nof foreshock transients are related to weak solar wind magnetic field strength\nand fast solar wind speed. Ion and electron energization are also positively\ncorrelated with solar wind speed.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of the role that strain plays on the\nelectronic structure of chromium nitride crystals. We use LSDA+U calculations\nto study the elastic constants, deforma- tion potentials and strain dependence\nof electron and hole masses near the fundamental gap. We consider the lowest\nenergy antiferromagnetic models believed to describe CrN at low temperatures,\nand apply strain along different directions. We find relatively large\ndeformation potentials for all models, and find increasing gaps for tensile\nstrain along most directions. Most interestingly, we find that compressive\nstrains should be able to close the relatively small indirect gap (' 100 meV)\nat moderate amplitudes ' 1.3%. We also find large and anisotropic changes in\nthe effective masses with strain, with principal axes closely related to the\nmagnetic ordering of neighboring layers in the antiferromagnet. It would be\ninteresting to consider the role that these effects may have on typical film\ngrowth on different substrates, and the possibility of monitoring optical and\ntransport properties of thin films as strain is applied.\n", "  We derive the nonlinear equations that describe coupled drift waves and ion\nacoustic waves in a plasma. We show that when the coupling to ion acoustic\nwaves is negligible, the reduced nonlinear equation is a generalization of the\nHasegawa-Mima equation to the three-dimensional (3D) case. We find an exact\nanalytical solution of this equation in the form 3D soliton drift wave (3D\nmodon). By numerical simulations we study collisions between the modons and\nshow that the collisions can be fully elastic.\n", "  The magnetic phase diagram of magnetoelectric LiCoPO$_4$ is established using\nneutron diffraction and magnetometry in fields up to 25.9T applied along the\ncrystallographic $b$-axis. For fields greater than 11.9T the magnetic unit cell\ntriples in size with propagation vector Q = (0, 1/3, 0). A magnetized elliptic\ncycloid is formed with spins in the $(b,c)$-plane and the major axis oriented\nalong $b$. Such a structure allows for the magnetoelectric effect with an\nelectric polarization along $c$ induced by magnetic fields applied along $b$.\nIntriguingly, additional ordering vectors Q $\\approx$ (0, 1/4, 0) and Q\n$\\approx$ (0, 1/2, 0) appear for increasing fields in the hysteresis region\nbelow the transition field. Traces of this behavior are also observed in the\nmagnetization. A simple model based on a mean-field approach is proposed to\nexplain these additional ordering vectors. In the field interval 20.5-21.0T,\nthe propagation vector Q = (0, 1/3, 0) remains but the spins orient differently\ncompared to the cycloid phase. Above 21.0T and up until saturation a\ncommensurate magnetic structure exists with a ferromagnetic component along $b$\nand an antiferromagnetic component along $c$.\n", "  The chiral magnetic and vortical effects denote the generation of\ndissipationless currents due to magnetic fields or rotation. They can be\nstudied in holographic models with Chern-Simons couplings dual to anomalies in\nfield theory. We study a holographic model with translation symmetry breaking\nbased on linear massless scalar field backgrounds. We compute the electric DC\nconductivity and find that it can vanish for certain values of the translation\nsymmetry breaking couplings. Then we compute the chiral magnetic and chiral\nvortical conductivities. They are completely independent of the holographic\ndisorder couplings and take the usual values in terms of chemical potential and\ntemperature. To arrive at this result we suggest a new definition of\nenergy-momentum tensor in presence of the gravitational Chern-Simons coupling.\n", "  In this paper, we explore supersymmetric and 2d analogs of the SYK model. We\nbegin by working out a basis of (super)conformal eigenfunctions appropriate for\nexpanding a four-point function. We use this to clarify some details of the 1d\nsupersymmetric SYK model. We then introduce new bosonic and supersymmetric\nanalogs of SYK in two dimensions. These theories consist of $N$ fields\ninteracting with random $q$-field interactions. Although models built entirely\nfrom bosons appear to be problematic, we find a supersymmetric model that flows\nto a large $N$ CFT with interaction strength of order one. We derive an\nintegral formula for the four-point function at order $1/N$, and use it to\ncompute the central charge, chaos exponent and some anomalous dimensions. We\ndescribe a problem that arises if one tries to find a 2d SYK-like CFT with a\ncontinuous global symmetry.\n", "  The spontaneous emergence of vector vortex beams with non-uniform\npolarization distribution is reported in a vertical-cavity surface-emitting\nlaser (VCSEL) with frequency-selective feedback. Antivortices with a hyperbolic\npolarization structure and radially polarized vortices are demonstrated. They\nexist close to and partially coexist with vortices with uniform and non-uniform\npolarization distributions characterized by four domains of pairwise orthogonal\npolarization. The spontaneous formation of these nontrivial structures in a\nsimple, nearly isotropic VCSEL system is remarkable and the vector vortices are\nargued to have soliton-like properties.\n", "  Eccentric binaries known as heartbeat stars experience strong dynamical tides\nas the stars pass through periastron, providing a laboratory to study tidal\ninteractions. We measure the rotation periods of 24 heartbeat systems, using\nthe Kepler light curves to identify rotation peaks in the Fourier transform.\nWhere possible, we compare the rotation period to the pseudosynchronization\nperiod derived by Hut 1981. Few of our heartbeat stars are pseudosynchronized\nwith the orbital period. For four systems, we were able to identify two sets of\nrotation peaks, which we interpret as the rotation from both stars in the\nbinary. The majority of the systems have a rotation period that is\napproximately 3/2 times the pseudosynchronization period predicted by Hut 1981,\nsuggesting that other physical mechanisms influence the stars' rotation, or\nthat stars typically reach tidal spin equilibrium at a rotation period slightly\nlonger than predicted.\n", "  Our detailed temperature dependent synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction\nstudies along with first-principles density functional perturbation theory\ncalculations, enable us to shed light on the origin of ferroelectricity in\nGdCrO3. The actual lattice symmetry is found to be noncentrosymmetric\northorhombic Pna21 structure, sup- porting polar nature of the system. Polar\ndistortion is driven by local symmetry breaking and by local distortions\ndominated by Gd off-centering. Our study reveals an intimate analogy between\nGdCrO3 and YCrO3. However, a distinctive difference exists that Gd is less\ndisplacive compared to Y, which results in an orthorhombic P na21 structure in\nGdCrO3 in contrast to monoclinic structure in YCrO3 and consequently, decreases\nits polar property. This is due to the subtle forces involving Gd-4f electrons\neither directly or indirectly. A strong magneto-electric coupling is revealed\nusing Raman measurements based analysis in the system below Cr-ordering\ntemperature, indicating their relevance to ferroelectric modulation.\n", "  Molecular line lists are important for modelling absorption and emission\nprocesses in atmospheres of different astronomical objects, such as cool stars\nand exoplanets. In order to be applicable for high temperatures, line lists for\nmolecules like methane must contain billions of transitions, which makes their\ndirect (line-by-line) application in radiative transfer calculations\nimpracticable. Here we suggest a new, hybrid line list format to mitigate this\nproblem, based on the idea of temperature-dependent absorption continuum.\n  The line list is partitioned into a large set of relatively weak lines and a\nsmall set of important, stronger lines. The weaker lines are then used either\nto construct a temperature-dependent (but pressure-independent) set of\nintensity cross sections or are blended into a greatly reduced set of\nsuper-lines. The strong lines are kept in the form of temperature independent\nEinstein A coefficients.\n  A line list for methane is constructed as a combination of 17 million strong\nabsorption lines relative to the reference absorption spectra and a background\nmethane continuum in two temperature-dependent forms, of cross sections and\nsuper-lines. This approach eases the use of large high temperature line lists\nsignificantly as the computationally expensive calculation of pressure\ndependent profiles only need to be performed for a relatively small number of\nlines. Both the line list and cross sections were generated using a new 34\nbillion methane line list (34to10), which extends the 10to10 line list to\nhigher temperatures (up to 2000 K). The new hybrid scheme can be applied to any\nlarge line lists containing billions of transitions. We recommend to use\nsuper-lines generated on a high resolution grid based on resolving power (R =\n1,000,000) to model the molecular continuum as a more flexible alternative to\nthe temperature dependent cross sections.\n", "  Radio observations of the region surrounding PSR J1301-6305 at 5.5 GHz and\n7.5 GHz were conducted with ATCA on September 5th, 2013. They were dedicated to\nthe search of the radio counterpart of the evolved pulsar wind nebula HESS\nJ1303-631, detected in X-rays and GeV-TeV gamma-rays. The collected data do not\nreveal any significant extended emission associated with PSR J1301-6305. In\naddition, archival 1.384 GHz and 2.368 GHz data do not show any evidence for a\nradio counterpart of HESS J1303-631. Archival 1.384 GHz observations reveal a\ndetection of an extended structure centred at an angular distance of 190 from\nthe pulsar. This extended structure might be a Supernova remnant (SNR) and a\npotential birth place of PSR J1301-6305. The implications of the lack of radio\ncounterpart of HESS J1303-631 on the understanding of the nature of the PWN are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this paper it is studied the cosmology of a homogeneous and isotropic\nspacetime endorsed with a conformally coupled massless scalar field. We find\nsix different solutions of the Friedmann equation that represent six different\ntypes of universes, all of them are periodically distributed along the complex\ntime axis. From a classical point of view, they are then isolated, separated by\nEuclidean regions that represent quantum mechanical barriers. Quantum\nmechanically, however, there is a non-zero probability for the state of the\nuniverses to tunnel out through a Euclidean instanton and suffer a sudden\ntransition to another state of the spacetime. We compute the probability of\ntransition for this and other non-local processes like the creation of\nuniverses in entangled pairs and, generally speaking, in multipartite entangled\nstates. We obtain the quantum state of a single universe within the formalism\nof the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and give the semiclassical state of the\nuniverses that describes the quantum mechanics of a scalar field propagating in\na deSitter background spacetime. We show that the superposition principle of\nthe quantum mechanics of matter fields alone is an emergent feature of the\nsemiclassical description of the universe that is not valid, for instance, in\nthe spacetime foam.\n  We use the third quantization formalism to describe the creation of an\nentangled pair of universes with opposite signs of their momenta conjugated to\nthe scale factor. Each universe of the entangled pair represents an expanding\nspacetime in terms of the WKB time experienced by internal observers in their\nparticle physics experiments. We compute the effective value of the Friedmann\nequation of the background spacetime of the two entangled universes and, thus,\nthe effects that the entanglement would have in their expansion rates...\n", "  We theoretically investigate the nature of laser-irradiated Kondo insulators.\nUsing Floquet theory and slave boson approach, we study a periodic Anderson\nmodel and derive an effective model which describes the laser-irradiated Kondo\ninsulators. In this model, we find two generic effects induced by laser light.\nOne is the dynamical localization, which suppresses hopping and hybridization.\nThe other is the laser-induced hopping and hybridization, which can be\ninterpreted as a synthetic spin-orbit coupling or magnetic field. The first\neffect drastically changes the behavior of the Kondo effect. Especially, the\nKondo effect under laser light qualitatively changes its character depending on\nwhether the hybridization is on-site or off-site. The second effect triggers\ntopological phase transitions. In topological Kondo insulators, linearly\npolarized laser light realizes phase transitions between trivial, weak\ntopological, and strong topological Kondo insulators. Moreover, circularly\npolarized laser light breaks time-reversal symmetry and induces Weyl\nsemimetallic phases. Our results pave the new way to dynamically control the\nKondo effect and topological phases in heavy fermion systems. We also discuss\nexperimental setups to detect the signatures.\n", "  We provide strong pieces of evidence that the mathematics of the\nthree-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds of the first, second and third smallest\nvolume is captured by the physics of the three-dimensional theories composed of\na complex boson and a Dirac fermion, both of unit charge, coupled to a U(1)\ngauge field with the Chern-Simons level $-5/2$, $-7/2$ and $-3/2$,\nrespectively.\n", "  In the context of the celebrated Kuramoto model of globally-coupled phase\noscillators of distributed natural frequencies, which serves as a paradigm to\ninvestigate spontaneous collective synchronization in many-body interacting\nsystems, we report on a very rich phase diagram in presence of thermal noise\nand an additional non-local interaction on a one-dimensional periodic lattice.\nRemarkably, the phase diagram involves both equilibrium and non-equilibrium\nphase transitions. In two contrasting limits of the dynamics, we obtain exact\nanalytical results for the phase transitions. These two limits correspond to\n(i) the absence of thermal noise, when the dynamics reduces to that of a\nnon-linear dynamical system, and (ii) the oscillators having the same natural\nfrequency, when the dynamics becomes that of a statistical system in contact\nwith a heat bath and relaxing to a statistical equilibrium state. In the former\ncase, our exact analysis is based on the use of the so-called Ott-Antonsen\nansatz to derive a reduced set of nonlinear partial differential equations for\nthe macroscopic evolution of the system. Our results for the case of\nstatistical equilibrium are on the other hand obtained by extending the\nwell-known transfer matrix approach for nearest-neighbor Ising model to\nconsider non-local interactions. The work offers a case study of exact analysis\nin many-body interacting systems. The results obtained underline the crucial\nrole of additional non-local interactions in either destroying or enhancing the\npossibility of observing synchrony in mean-field systems exhibiting spontaneous\nsynchronization.\n", "  Recent multi-telescope observations of the repeating Fast Radio Burst FRB\n121102 reveal a Gaussian-like spectral profile and associate the event with a\ndwarf metal-poor galaxy at a cosmological redshift of 0.19. Assuming that this\nevent represents the entire FRB population, we make predictions for the\nexpected number counts of FRBs observable by future radio telescopes between 50\nMHz and 3.5 GHz. We vary our model assumptions to bracket the expected rate of\nFRBs, and find that it exceeds one FRB per second per sky when accounting for\nfaint sources. We show that future low-frequency radio telescopes, such as the\nSquare Kilometer Array, could detect more than one FRB per minute over the\nentire sky originating from the epoch of reionization.\n", "  We present spectroscopic follow-up of candidate luminous Ly$\\alpha$ emitters\n(LAEs) at $z=5.7-6.6$ in the SA22 field with VLT/X-SHOOTER. We confirm two new\nluminous LAEs at $z=5.676$ (SR6) and $z=6.532$ (VR7), and also present {\\it\nHST} follow-up of both sources. These sources have luminosities L$_{\\rm\nLy\\alpha} \\approx 3\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, very high rest-frame equivalent\nwidths of EW$_0\\gtrsim 200$ {\\AA} and narrow Ly$\\alpha$ lines (200-340 km\ns$^{-1}$). VR7 is the most UV-luminous LAE at $z>6.5$, with M$_{1500} = -22.5$,\neven brighter in the UV than CR7. Besides Ly$\\alpha$, we do not detect any\nother rest-frame UV lines in the spectra of SR6 and VR7, and argue that\nrest-frame UV lines are easier to observe in bright galaxies with low\nLy$\\alpha$ equivalent widths. We confirm that Ly$\\alpha$ line-widths increase\nwith Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity at $z=5.7$, while there are indications that\nLy$\\alpha$ lines of faint LAEs become broader at $z=6.6$, potentially due to\nreionisation. We find a large spread of up to 3 dex in UV luminosity for\n$>L^{\\star}$ LAEs, but find that the Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity of the brightest\nLAEs is strongly related to UV luminosity at $z=6.6$. Under basic assumptions,\nwe find that several LAEs at $z\\approx6-7$ have Ly$\\alpha$ escape fractions\n$\\gtrsim100$ \\%, indicating bursty star-formation histories, alternative\nLy$\\alpha$ production mechanisms, or dust attenuating Ly$\\alpha$ emission\ndifferently than UV emission. Finally, we present a method to compute\n$\\xi_{ion}$, the production efficiency of ionising photons, and find that LAEs\nat $z\\approx6-7$ have high values of log$_{10}(\\xi_{ion}$/Hz erg$^{-1}) \\approx\n25.51\\pm0.09$ that may alleviate the need for high Lyman-Continuum escape\nfractions required for reionisation.\n", "  We compute the (center-of-mass frame) scattering angle $\\chi$ of\nhyperboliclike encounters of two spinning black holes, at the fourth\npost-Newtonian approximation level for orbital effects, and at the\nnext-to-next-to-leading order for spin-dependent effects. We find it convenient\nto compute the gauge-invariant scattering angle (expressed as a function of\nenergy, orbital angular momentum and spins) by using the Effective-One-Body\nformalism. The contribution to scattering associated with nonlocal, tail\neffects is computed by generalizing to the case of unbound motions the method\nof time-localization of the action introduced in the case of\n(small-eccentricity) bound motions by Damour, Jaranowski and Sch\\\"afer [Phys.\\\nRev.\\ D {\\bf 91}, no. 8, 084024 (2015)].\n", "  Large-scale vortices in protoplanetary disks are thought to form and survive\nfor long periods of time. Hence, they can significantly change the global disk\nevolution and particularly the distribution of the solid particles embedded in\nthe gas, possibly explaining asymmetries and dust concentrations recently\nobserved at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths. We investigate the\nspatial distribution of dust grains using a simple model of protoplanetary disk\nhosted by a giant gaseous vortex. We explore the dependence of the results on\ngrain size and deduce possible consequences and predictions for observations of\nthe dust thermal emission at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths. Global\n2D simulations with a bi-fluid code are used to follow the evolution of a\nsingle population of solid particles aerodynamically coupled to the gas.\nPossible observational signatures of the dust thermal emission are obtained\nusing simulators of ALMA and ngVLA observations. We find that a giant vortex\nnot only captures dust grains with Stokes number St < 1 but can also affect the\ndistribution of larger grains (with St '~' 1) carving a gap associated to a\nring composed of incompletely trapped particles. The results are presented for\ndifferent particle size and associated to their possible signatures in disk\nobservations. Gap clearing in the dust spatial distribution could be due to the\ninteraction with a giant gaseous vortex and their associated spiral waves,\nwithout the gravitational assistance of a planet. Hence, strong dust\nconcentrations at short sub-mm wavelengths associated with a gap and an\nirregular ring at longer mm and cm wavelengths could indicate the presence of\nan unseen gaseous vortex.\n", "  We study the optical properties of lowest-energy carbon allotropes in the\ninfrared, visible and ultra-violet ranges of light in the general gradient\napproximation of the density functional theory. In our calculations we used the\nall-electron approach as well as the pseudo-potential approximation. In the\ninfrared range, the complex dielectric functions, infrared and Raman spectra\nhave been calculated using CRYSTAL14 program. The electronic properties and\nenergy-dependent dielectric functions in the visible and ultraviolet ranges\nhave been calculated using VASP program. We have described with a good accuracy\nexperimentally known optical properties of cubic diamond crystal. Using\nobtained set of relevant parameters for calculations, we have predicted optical\nconstants, dielectric functions and Raman spectra for the lowest-energy\nhypothetical carbon allotropes and lonsdaleite.\n", "  Clouds form in the atmospheres of planets where they can determine the\nobservable spectra, the albedo and phase curves. Cloud properties are\ndetermined by the local thermodynamical and chemical conditions of an\natmospheric gas. A retrieval of gas abundances requires a comprehension of the\ncloud formation mechanisms under varying chemical conditions. With the aim of\nstudying cloud formation in metal rich atmospheres, we explore the possibility\nof clouds in evaporating exoplanets like CoRoT-7b and 55 Cnc e in comparison to\na generic set of solar abundances and the metal-rich gas giant HD149026b. We\nassess the impact of metal-rich, non-solar element abundances on the gas-phase\nchemistry, and apply our kinetic, non-equilibrium cloud formation model to\nstudy cloud structures and their details. We provide an overview of global\ncloud properties in terms of material compositions, maximum particle formation\nrates, and average cloud particle sizes for various sets of rocky element\nabundances. Our results suggest that the conditions on 55 Cnc e and HD149026b\nshould allow the formation of mineral clouds in their atmosphere. The high\ntemperatures on some hot-rocky super-Earths (e.g. the day-side of Corot-7b)\nresult in an ionised atmospheric gas and they prevent gas condensation, making\ncloud formation unlikely on its day-side.\n", "  Large-Momentum Effective Theory (or LaMET) advocated by the present authors\nprovides a direct approach to simulate parton physics in Eulidean lattice QCD\ntheory. Recently, there has been much interest in this theory in the\nliterature, with some questioning its validity and effectiveness. Here we\nprovide some discussions aiming at a further exposition of this approach. In\nparticular, we explain why it does not have the usual power divergence problem\nin lattice QCD calculations for the moments of parton distributions. We show\nthat although the Ioffe-time distribution provides an alternative way to\nextract the parton distribution from the same lattice observable, it also\nrequires the same large momentum limit as in LaMET to obtain a precision\ncalculation. With a proper quantification of errors, both extraction methods\nshould be compared with the same lattice data.\n", "  We propose a realization of a synthetic Random Flux Model in a\ntwo-dimensional optical lattice. Starting from Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian for two\natom species we show how to use fast-periodic modulation of the system\nparameters to construct random gauge field. We investigate the transport\nproperties of such a system and describe the impact of time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking and correlations in disorder on Anderson localization length.\n", "  The observation and research of the solar radio emission have unique\nscientific values in solar and space physics and related space weather\nforecasting applications, since the observed spectral structures may carry\nimportant information about energetic electrons and underlying physical\nmechanisms. In this study, we present the design of a novel dynamic\nspectrograph that is installed at the Chashan solar radio station operated by\nLaboratory for Radio Technologies, Institute of Space Sciences at Shandong\nUniversity. The spectrograph is characterized by the real-time storage of\ndigitized radio intensity data in the time domain and its capability to perform\noff-line spectral analysis of the radio spectra. The analog signals received\nvia antennas and amplified with a low-noise amplifier are converted into\ndigital data at a speed reaching up to 32 k data points per millisecond. The\ndigital data are then saved into a high-speed electronic disk for further\noff-line spectral analysis. Using different word length (1 k - 32 k) and time\ncadence (5 ms - 10 s) for the off-line fast Fourier transform analysis, we can\nobtain the dynamic spectrum of a radio burst with different (user-defined)\ntemporal (5 ms - 10 s) and spectral (3 kHz ~ 320 kHz) resolution. This brings a\ngreat flexibility and convenience to data analysis of solar radio bursts,\nespecially when some specific fine spectral structures are under study.\n", "  The physical origin of the Broad Line Region in Active Galactic Nuclei is\nstill unclear despite many years of observational studies. The reason is that\nthe region is unresolved and the reverberation mapping results imply complex\nvelocity field. We adopt a theory-motivated approach to identify the principal\nmechanism responsible for this complex phenomenon. We consider the possibility\nthat the role of dust is essential. We assume that the local radiation pressure\nacting on the dust in the accretion disk atmosphere launches the outflow of\nmaterial, but higher above the disk the irradiation from the central parts\ncause the dust evaporation and a subsequent fall back. This failed radiatively\naccelerated dusty outflow (FRADO) is expected to represent the material forming\nlow ionization lines. In this paper we formulate simple analytical equations\ndescribing the cloud motion, including the evaporation phase. The model is\nfully described just by the basic parameters: black hole mass, accretion rate,\nblack hole spin and the viewing angle. We study how the spectral line generic\nprofiles correspond to this dynamics. We show that the virial factor calculated\nfrom our model strongly depends on the black hole mass in case of enhanced dust\nopacity, and thus it then correlates with the line width. This could explain\nwhy the virial factor measured in galaxies with pseudo-bulges differs from that\nobtained from objects with classical bulges although the trend predicted by the\ncurrent version of the model is opposite to the observed trend.\n", "  Here, we show that deep trapped \"dark\" exciton states are responsible for the\nsurprisingly long lifetime of band-edge photoluminescence in acid-treated\nsingle-layer MoS2. Temperature-dependent transient photoluminescence\nspectroscopy reveals an exponential tail of long-lived states extending\nhundreds of meV into the band gap. These sub-band states, which are\ncharacterized by a 4 microsecond radiative lifetime, quickly capture and store\nphotogenerated excitons before subsequent thermalization up to the band edge\nwhere fast radiative recombination occurs. By intentionally saturating these\ntrap states, we are able to measure the \"true\" 150 ps radiative lifetime of the\nband-edge exciton at 77 K, which extrapolates to ~600 ps at room temperature.\nThese experiments reveal the dominant role of dark exciton states in\nacid-treated MoS2, and suggest that excitons spend > 95% of their lifetime at\nroom temperature in trap states below the band edge. We hypothesize that these\nstates are associated with native structural defects, which are not introduced\nby the superacid treatment; rather, the superacid treatment dramatically\nreduces non-radiative recombination through these states, extending the exciton\nlifetime and increasing the likelihood of eventual radiative recombination.\n", "  We study perturbative and global anomalies at the boundaries of bosonic\nanalogues of integer quantum Hall (BIQH) and topological insulator (BTI) phases\nusing a description of the boundaries of these phases in terms of a nonlinear\nsigma model (NLSM) with Wess-Zumino term. One of the main results of the paper\nis that these anomalies are robust against arbitrary smooth deformations of the\ntarget space of the NLSM which describes the phase, provided that the\ndeformations also respect the symmetry of the phase. In the first part of the\npaper we discuss the perturbative $U(1)$ anomaly at the boundary of BIQH states\nin all odd (spacetime) dimensions. In the second part we study global anomalies\nat the boundary of BTI states in even dimensions. In a previous work [Phys.\nRev. B 95, 035149 (2017)] we argued that the boundary of the BTI phase exhibits\na global anomaly which is an analogue of the parity anomaly of Dirac fermions\nin three dimensions. Here we elevate this argument to a proof for the boundary\nof the two-dimensional BTI state by explicitly computing the partition function\nof the gauged NLSM describing the boundary. We then use the powerful\nequivariant localization technique to show that this global anomaly is robust\nagainst all smooth deformations of the target space of the NLSM which preserve\nthe $U(1)\\rtimes\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of the BTI state. We also comment on the\ndifficulties of generalizing this latter proof to higher dimensions. Finally,\nwe discuss the expected low energy behavior of the boundary theories studied in\nthis paper when the coupling constants are allowed to flow under the\nrenormalization group.\n", "  Following the success of type Ia supernovae in constraining cosmologies at\nlower redshift $(z\\lesssim2)$, effort has been spent determining if a similarly\nuseful standardisable candle can be found at higher redshift. {In this work we\ndetermine the largest possible magnitude discrepancy between a constant dark\nenergy $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology and a cosmology in which the equation of state\n$w(z)$ of dark energy is a function of redshift for high redshift standard\ncandles $(z\\gtrsim2)$}. We discuss a number of popular parametrisations of\n$w(z)$ with two free parameters, $w_z$CDM cosmologies, including the\nChevallier-Polarski-Linder and generalisation thereof, $n$CPL, as well as the\nJassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan parametrisation. For each of these parametrisations we\ncalculate and find extrema of $\\Delta \\mu$, the difference between the distance\nmodulus of a $w_z$CDM cosmology and a fiducial $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology as a\nfunction of redshift, given 68\\% likelihood constraints on the parameters\n$P=(\\Omega_{m,0}, w_0, w_a)$. The parameters are constrained using cosmic\nmicrowave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae data\nusing CosmoMC. We find that none of the tested cosmologies can deviate more\nthan 0.05 mag from the fiducial $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology at high redshift,\nimplying that high redshift standard candles will not aid in discerning between\na $w_z$CDM cosmology and the fiducial $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Conversely, this\nimplies that if high redshift standard candles are found to be in disagreement\nwith $\\Lambda$CDM at high redshift, then this is a problem not only for\n$\\Lambda$CDM but for the entire family of $w_z$CDM cosmologies.\n", "  A newly formed magnetar has been proposed as the central engine of short GRBs\nto explain on-going energy injection giving observed plateau phases in the\nX-ray lightcurves. These rapidly spinning magnetars may be capable of emitting\npulsed emission comparable to known pulsars and magnetars. In this paper we\nshow that, if present, a periodic signal would be detectable during the plateau\nphases observed using the Swift X-Ray Telescope recording data in Window Timing\nmode. We conduct a targeted deceleration search for a periodic signal from a\nnewly formed magnetar in 2 Swift short GRBs and rule out any periodic signals\nin the frequency band 10-285 Hz to $\\approx$15-30% rms. These results\ndemonstrate that we would able to detect pulsations from the magnetar central\nengine of short GRBs if they contribute to 15-30% of the total emission. We\nconsider these constraints in the context of the potential emission mechanisms.\nThe non-detection is consistent with the emission being reprocessed in the\nsurrounding environment or with the rotation axis being highly aligned with the\nobserving angle. As the emission may be reprocessed, the expected periodic\nemission may only constitute a few percent of the total emission and be\nundetectable in our observations. Applying this strategy to future observations\nof the plateau phases with more sensitive X-ray telescopes may lead to the\ndetection of the periodic signal.\n", "  We consider singlet extensions of the standard model, both in the fermion and\nthe scalar sector, to account for the generation of neutrino mass at the TeV\nscale and the existence of dark matter respectively. For the neutrino sector we\nconsider models with extra singlet fermions which can generate neutrino mass\nvia the so called inverse or linear seesaw mechanism whereas a singlet scalar\nis introduced as the candidate for dark matter. We show that although these two\nsectors are disconnected at low energy, the coupling constants of both the\nsectors get correlated at high energy scale by the constraints coming from the\nperturbativity and stability/metastability of the electroweak vacuum. The\nsinglet fermions try to destabilize the electroweak vacuum while the singlet\nscalar aids the stability. As an upshot, the electroweak vacuum may attain\nabsolute stability even upto the Planck scale for suitable values of the\nparameters. We delineate the parameter space for the singlet fermion and the\nscalar couplings for which the electroweak vacuum remains stable/metastable and\nat the same time giving the correct relic density and neutrino masses and\nmixing angles as observed.\n", "  We present new ALMA observations aimed at mapping molecular gas reservoirs\nthrough the CO(3-2) transition in three quasars at $z\\simeq2.4$, LBQS\n0109+0213, 2QZ J002830.4-281706, and [HB89] 0329-385. Previous [OIII]5007\nobservations of these quasars showed evidence for ionised outflows quenching\nstar formation in their host galaxies. Systemic CO(3-2) emission has been\ndetected only in one quasar, LBQS 0109+0213, where the CO(3-2) emission is\nspatially anti-correlated with the ionised outflow, suggesting that most of the\nmolecular gas may have been dispersed or heated in the region swept by the\noutflow. In all three sources, including the one detected in CO, our\nconstraints on the molecular gas mass indicate a significantly reduced\nreservoir compared to main-sequence galaxies at the same redshift, supporting a\nnegative feedback scenario. In the quasar 2QZ J002830.4-281706, we tentatively\ndetect an emission line blob blue-shifted by $v\\sim-2000$ km/s with respect to\nthe galaxy systemic velocity and spatially offset by 0.2 arcsec (1.7 kpc) with\nrespect to the ALMA continuum peak. Interestingly, such emission feature is\ncoincident in both velocity and space with the ionised outflow as seen in\n[OIII]5007. This tentative detection must be confirmed with deeper observations\nbut, if real, it could represent the molecular counterpart of the ionised gas\noutflow driven by the AGN. Finally, in all ALMA maps we detect the presence of\nserendipitous line emitters within a projected distance $\\sim 160$ kpc from the\nquasars. By identifying these features with the CO(3-2) transition, the\nserendipitous line emitters would be located within |$\\Delta v$|$<$500 km/s\nfrom the quasars, hence suggesting an overdensity of galaxies in two out of\nthree quasars.\n", "  In this work, we present a highly accurate spectral neighbor analysis\npotential (SNAP) model for molybdenum (Mo) developed through the rigorous\napplication of machine learning techniques on large materials data sets.\nDespite Mo's importance as a structural metal, existing force fields for Mo\nbased on the embedded atom and modified embedded atom methods still do not\nprovide satisfactory accuracy on many properties. We will show that by fitting\nto the energies, forces and stress tensors of a large density functional theory\n(DFT)-computed dataset on a diverse set of Mo structures, a Mo SNAP model can\nbe developed that achieves close to DFT accuracy in the prediction of a broad\nrange of properties, including energies, forces, stresses, elastic constants,\nmelting point, phonon spectra, surface energies, grain boundary energies, etc.\nWe will outline a systematic model development process, which includes a\nrigorous approach to structural selection based on principal component\nanalysis, as well as a differential evolution algorithm for optimizing the\nhyperparameters in the model fitting so that both the model error and the\nproperty prediction error can be simultaneously lowered. We expect that this\nnewly developed Mo SNAP model will find broad applications in large-scale,\nlong-time scale simulations.\n", "  The supersymmetrization of curvature squared terms is important in the study\nof the low-energy limit of compactified superstrings where a distinguished role\nis played by the Gauss-Bonnet combination, which is ghost-free. In this letter,\nwe construct its off-shell ${\\cal N} = (1, 0)$ supersymmetrization in six\ndimensions for the first time. By studying this invariant together with the\nsupersymmetric Einstein-Hilbert term we confirm and extend known results of the\n$\\alpha'$-corrected string theory compactified to six dimensions. Finally, we\nanalyze the spectrum about the ${\\rm AdS}_3\\times{\\rm S}^3$ solution.\n", "  Using the duality between color and kinematics, we construct two-loop\nfour-point scattering amplitudes in $\\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM)\ntheory coupled to $N_f$ fundamental hypermultiplets. Our results are valid in\n$D\\le 6$ dimensions, where the upper bound corresponds to six-dimensional\nchiral $\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ SYM theory. By exploiting a close connection with\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory - and, equivalently, six-dimensional\n$\\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ SYM theory - we find compact integrands with\nfour-dimensional external vectors in both the maximally-helicity-violating\n(MHV) and all-chiral-vector sectors. Via the double-copy construction\ncorresponding $D$-dimensional half-maximal supergravity amplitudes with\nexternal graviton multiplets are obtained in the MHV and all-chiral sectors.\nAppropriately tuning $N_f$ enables us to consider both pure and matter-coupled\nsupergravity, with arbitrary numbers of vector multiplets in $D=4$. As a bonus,\nwe obtain the integrands of the genuinely six-dimensional supergravities with\n$\\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ and $\\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ supersymmetry. Finally, we extract\nthe potential ultraviolet divergence of half-maximal supergravity in\n$D=5-2\\epsilon$ and show that it non-trivially cancels out as expected.\n", "  Resonant chains are groups of planets for which each pair is in resonance,\nwith an orbital period ratio locked at a rational value (2/1, 3/2, etc.). Such\nchains naturally form as a result of convergent migration of the planets in the\nproto-planetary disk. In this article, I present an analytical model of\nresonant chains of any number of planets. Using this model, I show that a\nsystem captured in a resonant chain can librate around several possible\nequilibrium configurations. The probability of capture around each equilibrium\ndepends on how the chain formed, and especially on the order in which the\nplanets have been captured in the chain. Therefore, for an observed resonant\nchain, knowing around which equilibrium the chain is librating allows for\nconstraints to be put on the formation and migration scenario of the system. I\napply this reasoning to the four planets orbiting Kepler-223 in a 3:4:6:8\nresonant chain. I show that the system is observed around one of the six\nequilibria predicted by the analytical model. Using N-body integrations, I show\nthat the most favorable scenario to reproduce the observed configuration is to\nfirst capture the two intermediate planets, then the outermost, and finally the\ninnermost.\n", "  Observations of the Sun with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array have now\nstarted, and the thermal infrared will regularly be accessible from the NSF's\nDaniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope. Motivated by the prospect of these new data,\nand by recent flare observations in the mid infrared, we set out here to model\nand understand the source of the infrared continuum in flares, and to explore\nits diagnostic capability for the physical conditions in the flare atmosphere.\nWe use the 1D radiation hydrodynamics code RADYN to calculate mid-infrared\ncontinuum emission from model atmospheres undergoing sudden deposition of\nenergy by non-thermal electrons. We identify and characterise the main\ncontinuum thermal emission processes relevant to flare intensity enhancement in\nthe mid- to far-infrared (2-200 $\\mu$m) spectral range as free-free emission on\nneutrals and ions. We find that the infrared intensity evolution tracks the\nenergy input to within a second, albeit with a lingering intensity enhancement,\nand provides a very direct indication of the evolution of the atmospheric\nionization. The prediction of highly impulsive emission means that, on these\ntimescales, the atmospheric hydrodynamics need not be considered in analysing\nthe mid-IR signatures.\n", "  We describe the model for the mapping from sky brightness to the digital\noutput of the Dark Energy Camera, and the algorithms adopted by the Dark Energy\nSurvey (DES) for inverting this model to obtain photometric measures of\ncelestial objects from the raw camera output. The calibration aims for fluxes\nthat are uniform across the camera field of view and across the full angular\nand temporal span of the DES observations, approaching the accuracy limits set\nby shot noise for the full dynamic range of DES observations. The DES pipeline\nincorporates several substantive advances over standard detrending techniques,\nincluding: principal-components-based sky and fringe subtraction; correction of\nthe \"brighter-fatter\" nonlinearity; use of internal consistency in on-sky\nobservations to disentangle the influences of quantum efficiency, pixel-size\nvariations, and scattered light in the dome flats; and pixel-by-pixel\ncharacterization of instrument spectral response, through combination of\ninternal-consistency constraints with auxiliary calibration data. This article\nprovides conceptual derivations of the detrending/calibration steps, and the\nprocedures for obtaining the necessary calibration data. Other publications\nwill describe the implementation of these concepts for the DES operational\npipeline, the detailed methods, and the validation that the techniques can\nbring DECam photometry and astrometry within ~2 mmag and ~3 mas, respectively,\nof fundamental atmospheric and statistical limits. The DES techniques should be\nbroadly applicable to wide-field imagers.\n", "  Weyl type-II fermions are massless quasiparticles that obey the Weyl equation\nand which are predicted to occur at the boundary between electron- and\nhole-pockets in certain semi-metals, i.e. the (W,Mo)(Te,P)$_2$ compounds. Here,\nwe present a study of the Fermi-surface of WP$_2$ \\emph{via} the Shubnikov-de\nHaas (SdH) effect. Compared to other semi-metals WP$_2$ exhibits a very low\nresidual resistivity, i.e. $\\rho_0 \\simeq 10$ n$\\Omega$cm, which leads to\nperhaps the largest non-saturating magneto-resistivity $(\\rho(H))$ reported for\nany compound. For the samples displaying the smallest $\\rho_0$, $\\rho(H)$ is\nobserved to increase by a factor of $2.5 \\times 10^{7}$ $\\%$ under $\\mu_{0}H =\n35$ T at $T = 0.35$ K. The angular dependence of the SdH frequencies is found\nto be in very good agreement with the first-principle calculations when the\nelectron- and hole-bands are slightly shifted with respect to the Fermi level,\nthus supporting the existence of underlying Weyl type-II points in WP$_2$.\n", "  Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method has been increasingly used for\nsimulating fluid flows, however its ability to simulate evaporating flow\nrequires significant improvements. This paper proposes an SPH method for\nevaporating multiphase flows. The present SPH method can simulate the heat and\nmass transfers across the liquid-gas interfaces. The conservation equations of\nmass, momentum and energy were reformulated based on SPH, then were used to\ngovern the fluid flow and heat transfer in both the liquid and gas phases. The\ncontinuity equation of the vapor species was employed to simulate the vapor\nmass fraction in the gas phase. The vapor mass fraction at the interface was\npredicted by the Clausius-Clapeyron correlation. A new evaporation rate was\nderived to predict the mass transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase at\nthe interface. Because of the mass transfer across the liquid-gas interface,\nthe mass of an SPH particle was allowed to change. New particle splitting and\nmerging techniques were developed to avoid large mass difference between SPH\nparticles of the same phase. The proposed method was tested by simulating three\nproblems, including the Stefan problem, evaporation of a static drop, and\nevaporation of a drop impacting on a hot surface. For the Stefan problem, the\nSPH results of the evaporation rate at the interface agreed well with the\nanalytical solution. For drop evaporation, the SPH result was compared with the\nresult predicted by a level-set method from literature. In the case of drop\nimpact on a hot surface, the evolution of the shape of the drop, temperature,\nand vapor mass fraction were predicted.\n", "  We study (non-perturbatively) the interactions of delta-coupled detectors\nwith coherent states of a scalar field. We show that the time-evolved density\nmatrix spectra of i) a single detector, ii) two detectors, and iii) the partial\ntranspose of the latter, are all independent of which coherent state the field\nwas in. Furthermore, we find that the eigenvalues in iii) are non-negative,\nimplying that a delta-coupled detector pair cannot harvest entanglement from\nthe vacuum, or any other coherent field state.\n", "  The acceleration times of the highest-energy particles which emit gamma-rays\nin young and middle-age SNRs are comparable with SNR age. If the number of\nparticles starting acceleration was varying during early times after the\nsupernova explosion then this variation should be reflected in the shape of the\ngamma-ray spectrum. We use the solution of the non-stationary equation for\nparticle acceleration in order to analyze this effect. As a test case, we apply\nour method to describe gamma-rays from IC443. As a proxy of the IC443 parent\nsupernova we consider SN1987A. First, we infer the time dependence of injection\nefficiency from evolution of the radio spectral index in SN1987A. Then, we use\nthe inferred injection behavior to fit the gamma-ray spectrum of IC443. We show\nthat the break in the proton spectrum needed to explain the gamma-ray emission\nis a natural consequence of the early variation of the cosmic ray injection,\nand that the very-high energy gamma-rays originate from particles which began\nacceleration during the first months after the supernova explosion. We conclude\nthat the shape of the gamma-ray spectrum observed today in SNRs critically\ndepends on the time variation of the cosmic ray injection process in the\nimmediate post explosion phases. With the same model, we estimate also the\npossibility in the future to detect gamma-rays from SN 1987A.\n", "  Long-lasting emission of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is crucial to reveal\nthe physical origin of the central engine as well as to detect electromagnetic\n(EM) counterparts to gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron star binary\nmergers. We investigate 65 X-ray light curves of short GRBs, which is six times\nmore than previous studies, by combining both Swift/BAT and XRT data. The light\ncurves are found to consist of two distinct components at $>5\\sigma$ with\nbimodal distributions of luminosity and duration, i.e., extended (with\ntimescale $\\lesssim10^3$ s) and plateau emission (with timescale $\\gtrsim10^3$\ns), which are likely the central engine activities but not afterglows. The\nextended emission has an isotropic energy comparable to the prompt emission,\nwhile the plateau emission has $\\sim0.01-1$ times of that energy. A half (50\\%)\nof our sample has both components, while the other half is consistent with\nhaving both components. This leads us to conjecture that almost all short GRBs\nhave both the extended and plateau emission. The long-lasting emission can be\nexplained by the jets from black holes with fallback ejecta, and could power\nmacronovae (or kilonovae) like GRB 130603B and GRB 160821B. Based on the\nobserved properties, we quantify the detectability of EM counterparts to GWs,\nincluding the plateau emission scattered to the off-axis angle, with CALET/HXM,\nINTEGRAL/SPI-ACS, Fermi/GBM, MAXI/GSC, Swift/BAT, XRT, future ISS-Lobster/WFI,\nEinstein Probe/WXT, and eROSITA.\n", "  The study of galaxy morphology is fundamental to understand the physical\nprocesses driving the structural evolution of galaxies. It has long been known\nthat dense environments host high fractions of early-type galaxies and low\nfractions of late-type galaxies, indicating that the environment affects the\nstructural evolution of galaxies. In this paper we present an analysis of the\nmorphological composition of red sequence galaxies in a sample of 9 galaxy\nclusters at $0.8<z<1.5$ drawn from the HAWK-I cluster survey (HCS), with the\naim of investigating the evolutionary paths of galaxies with different\nmorphologies. We classify galaxies according to their apparent bulge-to-total\nlight ratio and compare with red sequence galaxies from the lower-redshift\nWINGS and EDisCS surveys. We find that, while the HCS red sequence is dominated\nby elliptical galaxies at all luminosities and stellar masses, the WINGS red\nsequence is dominated by elliptical galaxies only at its bright end\n($M_V<-21.0$ mag), while S0s become the most frequent class at fainter\nluminosities. Disc-dominated galaxies comprise 10-14\\% of the red sequence\npopulation in the low (WINGS) and high (HCS) redshift samples, although their\nfraction increases up to 40\\% at $0.4 < z < 0.8$ (EDisCS). We find a 20\\%\nincrease in the fraction of S0 galaxies from $z \\sim 1.5$ to $z \\sim 0.05$ on\nthe red sequence. These results suggest that elliptical and S0 galaxies follow\ndifferent evolutionary histories and, in particular, that S0 galaxies result,\nat least at intermediate luminosities ($-22.0 < M_V < -20.0$), from the\nmorphological transformation of quiescent spiral galaxies.\n", "  Primordial nucleosynthesis, or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), is one of the\nthree evidences for the big bang model, together with the expansion of the\nuniverse and the cosmic microwave background. There is a good global agreement\nover a range of nine orders of magnitude between abundances of 4He, D, 3He and\n7Li deduced from observations, and calculated in primordial nucleosynthesis.\nHowever, there remains a yet-unexplained discrepancy of a factor 3, between the\ncalculated and observed lithium primordial abundances, that has not been\nreduced, neither by recent nuclear physics experiments, nor by new\nobservations. The precision in deuterium observations in cosmological clouds\nhas recently improved dramatically, so that nuclear cross-sections involved in\ndeuterium BBN needs to be known with similar precision. We will briefly discuss\nnuclear aspects related to the BBN of Li and D, BBN with nonstandard neutron\nsources, and finally, improved sensitivity studies using a Monte Carlo method\nthat can be used in other sites of nucleosynthesis.\n", "  In a previous work, it was shown that all Ricci-flat spacetimes are exact\nsolutions for a large class of non-local gravitational theories. Here we prove\nthat, for a subclass of non-local theories, the Schwarzschild singularity is\nstable under linear perturbations. Thus, non-locality may be not enough to cure\nall the singularities of general relativity. Finally, we show that the\nSchwarzschild solution can be generated by the gravitational collapse of a thin\nshell of radiation.\n", "  It was suggested that two entangled fermions can behave like a single boson\nand that the bosonic quality is proportional to the degree of entanglement\nbetween the two particles. The relation between bosonic quality and\nentanglement is quite natural if one takes into account the fact that\nentanglement appears in bound states of interacting systems. However,\nentanglement can still be present in spatially separated subsystems that do not\ninteract anymore. These systems are often a subject of studies on quantum\nnonlocality and foundations of quantum physics. Here, we ask whether an\nentangled spatially separated fermionic pair can exhibit bosonic properties. We\nshow that in certain conditions the answer to this question can be positive. In\nparticular, we propose a nonlocal bunching scenario in which two such pairs\nform an analogue of a two-partite bosonic Fock state.\n", "  Following the renewed interest for axions as a dark matter component, we\nrevisit the effects of energy loss by axion emission on the evolution of the\nfirst generation of stars. These stars with zero metallicity are supposed to be\nmassive, more compact, and hotter than subsequent generations. It is hence\nimportant to extend previous studies restricted to solar metallicity stars. Our\nanalysis first compares the evolution of solar metallicity 8, 10 and 12\nM$_\\odot$ stars to previous work. We then calculate the evolution of 8 zero\nmetallicity stars with and without axion losses and with masses ranging from 20\nto 150 M$_\\odot$. For the solar metallicity models, we confirm the\ndisappearance of the blue loop phase for a value of the axion-photon coupling,\n$g_{a\\gamma}=10^{-10} {\\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Regarding the Pop. III stars, we show\nthat for $g_{a\\gamma}=10^{-10} {\\rm GeV}^{-1}$, their evolution is not much\naffected by axion losses except within the range of masses 80$-$130 M$_\\odot$.\nSuch stars show significant differences both in their tracks within the\n$T_c$-$\\rho_c$ diagram and in their central composition (in particular\n$^{20}$Ne and $^{24}$Mg). We discuss the origin of these modifications from the\nstellar physics point of view, and their potential observational signatures.\n", "  Motivated by the close connection of tensor models to the SYK model, we use\nrepresentation theory to construct the complete set of gauge invariant\nobservables for bosonic and fermionic tensor models. Correlation functions of\nthe gauge invariant operators in the free theory are computed exactly. The\ngauge invariant operators close a ring. The structure constants of the ring are\ndescribed explicitly. Finally, we construct a collective field theory\ndescription of the bosonic tensor model.\n", "  Worldwide several radiation sources contribute to the delivered dose to the\nhuman population. This radiation also acts as natural background when detecting\nradiation, for instance from radioactive sources. In this work a medium-size\nplastic scintillation detector is used to evaluate the dose delivered by\nnatural radiation sources. Calibration of the detector involved the use of\nradioactive sources and Monte Carlo simulation of the energy deposition per\ndisintegration. A measurement of the annual dose due to background radiation to\nthe body was then estimated. A dose value compatible with the value reported by\nthe United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation was\nobtained.\n", "  The concept of a hyperuniformity disorder length $h$ was recently introduced\nfor analyzing volume fraction fluctuations for a set of measuring windows. This\nlength permits a direct connection to the nature of disorder in the spatial\nconfiguration of the particles, and provides a way to diagnose the degree of\nhyperuniformity in terms of the scaling of $h$ and its value in comparison with\nestablished bounds. Here, this approach is generalized for extended particles,\nwhich are larger than the image resolution and can lie partially inside and\npartially outside the measuring windows. The starting point is an expression\nfor the volume fraction variance in terms of four distinct volumes: that of the\nparticle, the measuring window, the mean-squared overlap between particle and\nregion, and the region over which particles have non-zero overlap with the\nmeasuring window. After establishing limiting behaviors, computational methods\nare developed for both continuum and pixelated particles. Exact results are\npresented for particles of special shape, and for measuring windows of special\nshape. Comparison is made for other particle shapes, using simulated Poisson\npatterns. And the effects of polydisersity and image errors are discussed. For\nsmall measuring windows, both particle shape and spatial arrangement affect the\nform of the variance. For large regions, the variance scaling depends only on\narrangement but particle shape sets the numerical proportionality. The combined\nunderstanding permit the measured variance to be translated to the spectrum of\nhyperuniformity lengths versus region size, as the quantifier of spatial\narrangement. This program is demonstrated for a system of non-overlapping\nparticles at a series of increasing packing fractions as well as for an\nEinstein pattern of particles with several different extended shapes.\n", "  A simple theorem is proved: When a gauge-invariant local field theory is\nwritten in terms of matter fields alone, a composite gauge boson or bosons must\nbe formed dynamically. The theorem results from the fact that the Noether\ncurrent vanishes in such theories. The proof is carried out by use of the\ncharge-field algebra at equal time in the Heisenberg picture together with the\nwell-established analyticity of the form factor of the current. While there is\nno need of diagram calculation for the proof, we demonstrate in the leading 1/N\nexpansion of the existing models what the theorem means in diagrams and how the\ncomposite gauge boson emerges.\n", "  A highly significant structure is observed in the $\\Lambda_c^+K^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$\nmass spectrum, where the $\\Lambda_c^+$ baryon is reconstructed in the decay\nmode $pK^-\\pi^+$. The structure is consistent with originating from a weakly\ndecaying particle, identified as the doubly charmed baryon $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$. The\ndifference between the masses of the $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ and $\\Lambda_c^+$ states\nis measured to be $1334.94 \\pm 0.72 (\\mathrm{stat}) \\pm 0.27\n(\\mathrm{syst}~\\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$, and the $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ mass is then\ndetermined to be $3621.40 \\pm 0.72 (\\mathrm{stat}) \\pm 0.27 (\\mathrm{syst} \\pm\n0.14 \\, (\\Lambda_c^+)~\\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$, where the last uncertainty is due to\nthe limited knowledge of the $\\Lambda_c^+$ mass. The state is observed in a\nsample of proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n1.7 $\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, and confirmed in an additional sample of data collected\nat 8 TeV.\n", "  Entangled magnetic fields entering into an accretion flow would very soon be\nstretched into a dominant toroidal component due to strong differentially\nrotating motion inside the accretion disc. This is particularly true for weakly\nviscous, low angular momentum transonic or advective discs. We study the\ntrajectories of toroidal flux tubes inside a geometrically thick flow which\nundergoes a centrifugal force supported shock. We also study effects of these\nflux tubes on the dynamics of the inflow and the outflow. We use a finite\ndifference method (Total Variation Diminishing) for this purpose and\nspecifically focussed on whether these flux tubes significantly affect the\nproperties of the outflows such as its collimation and the rate. It is seen\nthat depending upon the cross-sectional radius of the flux tubes which control\nthe drag force, these field lines may move towards the central object or\noscillate vertically before eventually escaping out of the funnel wall\n(pressure zero surfaces) along the vertical direction. A comparison of results\nobtained with and without flux tubes show these flux tubes could play pivotal\nrole in collimation and acceleration of jets and outflows.\n", "  The Fermi-LAT collaboration recently published deep upper limits to the\ngamma-ray emission of the Coma cluster, a cluster that hosts the prototype of\ngiant radio halos. In this paper we extend previous studies and use a formalism\nthat combines particle reacceleration by turbulence and the generation of\nsecondary particles in the intracluster medium to constrain relativistic\nprotons and their role for the origin of the radio halo. We conclude that a\npure hadronic origin of the radio halo is clearly disfavoured as it would\nrequire magnetic fields that are too strong. For instance $B_0 > 21 \\mu$G is\nfound in the cluster center assuming that the magnetic energy density scales\nwith thermal density, to be compared with $B_0 \\sim 4-5 \\mu$G as inferred from\nRotation Measures (RM) under the same assumption. However secondary particles\ncan still generate the observed radio emission if they are reaccelerated. For\nthe first time the deep gamma-ray limits allow us to derive meaningful\nconstraints if the halo is generated during phases of reacceleration of\nrelativistic protons and their secondaries by cluster-scale turbulence. In this\npaper we explore a relevant range of parameter-space of reacceleration models.\nWithin this parameter space a fraction of model configurations is already ruled\nout by current gamma-ray limits, including the cases that assume weak magnetic\nfields in the cluster core, $B \\leq 2-3 \\mu$G. Interestingly, we also find that\nthe flux predicted by a large fraction of model configurations that assume a\nmagnetic field consistent with RM is not far from the limits. This suggests\nthat a detection of gamma rays from the cluster might be possible in the near\nfuture, provided that the electrons generating the radio halo are secondaries\nreaccelerated and the magnetic field in the cluster is consistent with that\ninferred from RM.\n", "  The lines-of-sight to highly reddened SNe Ia show peculiar continuum\npolarization curves, growing toward blue wavelengths and peaking at\n$\\lambda_{max} \\lesssim 0.4 \\mu m$, like no other sight line to any normal\nGalactic star. We examined continuum polarization measurements of a sample of\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) and post-AGB stars from the literature, finding\nthat some PPNe have polarization curves similar to those observed along SNe Ia\nsight lines. Those polarization curves are produced by scattering on\ncircumstellar dust. We discuss the similarity and the possibility that at least\nsome SNe Ia might explode during the post-AGB phase of their binary companion.\nFurthermore, we speculate that the peculiar SNe Ia polarization curves might\nprovide observational support to the core-degenerate progenitor model.\n", "  We study how the transient excitation probability of a two-level atom by a\nquantized field depends on the temporal profile of the incident pulse, in the\npresence of external losses, for both coherent and Fock states, and in two\ncomplementary limits: when the pulse contains only one photon (on average), and\nwhen the number of photons $N$ is large. For the latter case we derive\nanalytical expressions for the scaling of the excitation probability with $N$\nthat can be easily evaluated for any pulse shape.\n", "  Primordial Black Holes (PBH) could be the cold dark matter of the universe.\nThey could have arisen from large (order one) curvature fluctuations produced\nduring inflation that reentered the horizon in the radiation era. At reentry,\nthese fluctuations source gravitational waves (GW) via second order anisotropic\nstresses. These GW, together with those (possibly) sourced during inflation by\nthe same mechanism responsible for the large curvature fluctuations, constitute\na primordial stochastic GW background (SGWB) that unavoidably accompanies the\nPBH formation. We study how the amplitude and the range of frequencies of this\nsignal depend on the statistics (Gaussian versus $\\chi^2$) of the primordial\ncurvature fluctuations, and on the evolution of the PBH mass function due to\naccretion and merging. We then compare this signal with the sensitivity of\npresent and future detectors, at PTA and LISA scales. We find that this SGWB\nwill help to probe, or strongly constrain, the early universe mechanism of PBH\nproduction. The comparison between the peak mass of the PBH distribution and\nthe peak frequency of this SGWB will provide important information on the\nmerging and accretion evolution of the PBH mass distribution from their\nformation to the present era. Different assumptions on the statistics and on\nthe PBH evolution also result in different amounts of CMB $\\mu$-distortions.\nTherefore the above results can be complemented by the detection (or the\nabsence) of $\\mu$-distortions with an experiment such as PIXIE.\n", "  We report on an all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves in the\nfrequency band 20-475 Hz and with a frequency time derivative in the range of\n[-1.0, +0.1]e-8 Hz/s. Such a signal could be produced by a nearby spinning and\nslightly non-axisymmetric isolated neutron star in our galaxy. This search uses\nthe data from Advanced LIGO's first observational run, O1. No periodic\ngravitational wave signals were observed, and upper limits were placed on their\nstrengths. The lowest upper limits on worst-case (linearly polarized) strain\namplitude h0 are 4e-25 near 170 Hz. For a circularly polarized source (most\nfavorable orientation), the smallest upper limits obtained are 1.5e-25. These\nupper limits refer to all sky locations and the entire range of frequency\nderivative values. For a population-averaged ensemble of sky locations and\nstellar orientations, the lowest upper limits obtained for the strain amplitude\nare 2.5e-25.\n", "  We present theoretical and experimental results showing the effects of\nincoherent population mixing on two-dimensional (2D) coherent excitation\nspectra that are measured via a time-integrated population and phase-sensitive\ndetection. The technique uses four collinear ultrashort pulses and phase\nmodulation to acquire two-dimensional spectra by isolating specific nonlinear\ncontributions to the photoluminescence or photocurrent excitation signal. We\ndemonstrate that an incoherent contribution to the measured lineshape, arising\nfrom nonlinear population dynamics over the entire photoexcitation lifetime,\ngenerates a similar lineshape to the expected 2D coherent spectra in\ncondensed-phase systems. In those systems, photoexcitations are mobile such\nthat inter-particle interactions are important on any timescale, including\nthose long compared to the 2D coherent experiment. Measurements on a\nsemicrystalline polymeric semiconductor film at low temperature show that, in\nsome conditions in which multi-exciton interactions are suppressed, the\ntechnique predominantly detects coherent signal and can be used, in our\nexample, to extract homogeneous linewidths. The same method used on a\nlead-halide perovskite photovoltaic cell shows that incoherent population\nmixing of mobile photocarriers can dominate the measured signal since\ncarrier-carrier bimolecular scattering is active even at low excitation\ndensities, which hides the coherent contribution to the spectral lineshape.\n", "  We numerically study amorphous analogues of a two-dimensional photonic Chern\ninsulator. The amorphous lattices consist of gyromagnetic rods that break\ntime-reversal symmetry, with the lattice sites generated by a close-packing\nalgorithm. The level of short-range order is adjustable, and there is no\nlong-range order. The topologically nontrivial gaps of the photonic Chern\ninsulator are found to persist into the amorphous regime, so long as there is\nsufficient short-range order. Strongly nonreciprocal robust transmission occurs\nvia edge states, which are shown to propagate ballistically despite the absence\nof long-range order, and to be exponentially localized along the lattice edge.\nInterestingly, there is an enhancement of nonreciprocal transmission even at\nvery low levels of short-range order, where there are no discernable spectral\ngaps.\n", "  A recent study reported a strong apparent depression of Fe I, relative to Fe\nII, in the AGB stars of NGC 6752. This depression is much greater than that\nexpected from the neglect of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects, in\nparticular the dominant effect of overionisation. Here we attempt to reproduce\nthe apparent Fe discrepancy, and investigate differences in reported sodium\nabundances. We compare in detail the methods and results of the recent study\nwith those of an earlier study of NGC 6752 AGB stars. Iron and sodium\nabundances are derived using Fe I, Fe II, and Na I lines. Various uncertainties\nare explored. We reproduce the large Fe I depression found by the recent study,\nusing different observational data and computational tools. Further\ninvestigation shows that the degree of the apparent Fe I depression is strongly\ndependent on the adopted stellar effective temperature. To minimise\nuncertainties in Fe I we derive temperatures for each star individually using\nthe infrared flux method (IRFM). We find that the $T_{\\rm{eff}}$ scales used by\nboth the previous studies are cooler, by up to 100 K; such underestimated\ntemperatures amplify the apparent Fe I depression. Our IRFM temperatures result\nin negligible apparent depression, consistent with theory. We also re-derived\nsodium abundances and, remarkably, found them to be unaffected by the new\ntemperature scale. [Na/H] in the AGB stars is consistent between all studies.\nSince Fe is constant, it follows that [Na/Fe] is also consistent between\nstudies, apart from any systematic offsets in Fe. We recommend the use of\n$(V-K)$ relations for AGB stars. We plan to investigate the effect of the\nimproved temperature scale on other elements, and re-evaluate the subpopulation\ndistributions on the AGB, in the next paper of this series. [abridged]\n", "  We investigate the large-N limit of the BMN matrix model by analyzing the\ndynamics of ellipsoidal M2-branes that spin in the 11-dimensional maximally\nsupersymmetric SO(3)xSO(6) plane-wave background. We identify finite-energy\nsolutions by specifying the local minima of the corresponding energy\nfunctional. These configurations are static in SO(3) due to the Myers effect\nand rotate in SO(6) with an angular momentum that is bounded from above. As a\nfirst step towards studying their chaotic properties, we evaluate the Lyapunov\nexponents of their radial fluctuations.\n", "  Molecular clouds are the principle stellar nurseries of our universe, keeping\nthem in the focus of both observational and theoretical studies. From\nobservations, some of the key properties of molecular clouds are well known but\nmany questions regarding their evolution and star formation activity remain\nopen. While numerical simulations feature a large number and complexity of\ninvolved physical processes, this plenty of effects may hide the fundamentals\nthat determine the evolution of molecular clouds and enable the formation of\nstars. Purely analytical models, on the other hand, tend to suffer from rough\napproximations or a lack of completeness, limiting their predictive power. In\nthis paper, we present a model that incorporates central concepts of\nastrophysics as well as reliable results from recent simulations of molecular\nclouds and their evolutionary paths. Based on that, we construct a\nself-consistent semi-analytical framework that describes the formation,\nevolution and star formation activity of molecular clouds, including a number\nof feedback effects to account for the complex processes inside those objects.\nThe final equation system is solved numerically but at much lower computational\nexpense than, e.g., hydrodynamical descriptions of comparable systems. The\nmodel presented in this paper agrees well with a broad range of observational\nresults, showing that molecular cloud evolution can be understood as an\ninterplay between accretion, global collapse, star formation and stellar\nfeedback.\n", "  We investigate the spectrum of finite-length carbon nanotubes in the presence\nof onsite and nearest-neighbor superconducting pairing terms. A one-dimensional\nladder-type lattice model is developed to explore the low-energy spectrum and\nthe nature of the electronic states. We find that zero energy edge states can\nemerge in zigzag class carbon nanotubes as a combined effect of\ncurvature-induced Dirac point shift and strong superconducting coupling between\nnearest-neighbor sites. The chiral symmetry of the system is exploited to\ndefine a winding number topological invariant. The associated topological phase\ndiagram shows regions with nontrivial winding number in the plane of chemical\npotential and superconducting nearest-neighbor pair potential (relative to the\nonsite pair potential). A one-dimensional continuum model reveals the\ntopological origin of the zero energy edge states: A bulk-edge correspondence\nis proven, which shows that the condition for nontrivial winding number and\nthat for the emergence of edge states are identical. For armchair class\nnanotubes, the presence of edge states in the superconducting gap depends on\nthe nanotube's boundary shape. For the minimal boundary condition, the\nemergence of the subgap states can also be deduced from the winding number.\n", "  The stability of planets in the alpha-Centauri AB stellar system has been\nstudied extensively. However, most studies either focus on the orbital plane of\nthe binary or consider inclined circular orbits.\n  Here, we numerically investigate the stability of a possible planet in the\nalpha-Centauri AB binary system for S-type orbits in an arbitrary spatial\nconfiguration. In particular, we focus on inclined orbits and explore the\nstability for different eccentricities and orientation angles.\n  We show that large stable and regular regions are present for very eccentric\nand inclined orbits, corresponding to libration in the Lidov-Kozai resonance.\nWe additionally show that these extreme orbits can survive over the age of the\nsystem, despite the effect of tides. Our results remain qualitatively the same\nfor any compact binary system.\n", "  We obtained long-slit optical spectroscopy of one transit of WASP-48b with\nthe Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated\nSpectroscopy (OSIRIS) spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias\n(GTC). We integrated the spectrum of WASP-48 and one reference star in several\nchannels with different wavelength ranges, creating numerous color light curves\nof the transit. We fit analytic transit curves to the data taking into account\nthe systematic effects present in the time series in an effort to measure the\nchange of the planet-to-star radius ratio ($R_p/R_s$) across wavelength. After\nremoving the transit model and systematic trends to the curves we reached\nprecisions between 261 ppm and 455-755 ppm for the white and spectroscopic\nlight curves, respectively. We obtained $R_p/R_s$ uncertainty values between\n$0.8 \\times 10^{-3}$ and $1.5\\times 10^{-3}$ for all the curves analyzed in\nthis work. The measured transit depth for the curves made by integrating the\nwavelength range between 530 nm and 905 nm is in agreement with previous\nstudies. We report a relatively flat transmission spectrum for WASP-48b with no\nstatistical significant detection of atmospheric species, although the\ntheoretical models that fit the data more closely include of TiO and VO.\n", "  The Atacama Large millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) makes use of water\nvapour radiometers (WVR), which monitor the atmospheric water vapour line at\n183 GHz along the line of sight above each antenna to correct for phase delays\nintroduced by the wet component of the troposphere. The application of WVR\nderived phase corrections improve the image quality and facilitate successful\nobservations in weather conditions that were classically marginal or poor. We\npresent work to indicate that a scaling factor applied to the WVR solutions can\nact to further improve the phase stability and image quality of ALMA data. We\nfind reduced phase noise statistics for 62 out of 75 datasets from the\nlong-baseline science verification campaign after a WVR scaling factor is\napplied. The improvement of phase noise translates to an expected coherence\nimprovement in 39 datasets. When imaging the bandpass source, we find 33 of the\n39 datasets show an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) between a\nfew to ~30 percent. There are 23 datasets where the S/N of the science image is\nimproved: 6 by <1%, 11 between 1 and 5%, and 6 above 5%. The higher frequencies\nstudied (band 6 and band 7) are those most improved, specifically datasets with\nlow precipitable water vapour (PWV), <1mm, where the dominance of the wet\ncomponent is reduced. Although these improvements are not profound, phase\nstability improvements via the WVR scaling factor come into play for the higher\nfrequency (>450 GHz) and long-baseline (>5km) observations. These inherently\nhave poorer phase stability and are taken in low PWV (<1mm) conditions for\nwhich we find the scaling to be most effective. A promising explanation for the\nscaling factor is the mixing of dry and wet air components, although other\norigins are discussed. We have produced a python code to allow ALMA users to\nundertake WVR scaling tests and make improvements to their data.\n", "  We analyze isolated resonance curves (IRCs) in a single-degree-of-freedom\nsystem with nonlinear damping. The adopted procedure exploits singularity\ntheory in conjunction with the harmonic balance method. The analysis unveils a\ngeometrical connection between the topology of the damping force and IRCs.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that extremas and zeros of the damping force\ncorrespond to the appearance and merging of IRCs.\n", "  We present the near-infrared observations of population II Cepheids in the\nGalactic bulge from VVV survey. We identify 340 population II Cepheids in the\nGalactic bulge from VVV survey based on their match with OGLE-III Catalogue.\nThe single-epoch $JH$ and multi-epoch $K_s$ observations complement the\naccurate periods and optical $(VI)$ mean-magnitudes from OGLE. The sample\nconsisting of BL Herculis and W Virginis subtypes is used to derive\nperiod-luminosity relations after correcting mean-magnitudes for the\nextinction. Our $K_s$-band period-luminosity relation, $K_s =\n-2.189(0.056)~[\\log(P) - 1] + 11.187(0.032)$, is consistent with published work\nfor BL Herculis and W Virginis variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We\npresent a combined OGLE-III and VVV catalogue with periods, classification,\nmean magnitudes and extinction for 264 Galactic bulge population II Cepheids\nhaving good-quality $K_s$-band light curves. The absolute magnitudes for\npopulation II Cepheids and RR Lyraes calibrated using Gaia and Hubble Space\nTelescope parallaxes, together with calibrated magnitudes for Large Magellanic\nCloud population II Cepheids, are used to obtain a distance to the Galactic\ncenter, $R_0=8.34\\pm0.03{\\mathrm{(stat.)}}\\pm0.41{\\mathrm{(syst.)}}$, which\nchanges by $^{+ 0.05}_{-0.25}$ with different extinction laws. While noting the\nlimitation of small number statistics, we find that the present sample of\npopulation II Cepheids in the Galactic bulge shows a nearly spheroidal spatial\ndistribution, similar to metal-poor RR Lyrae variables. We do not find evidence\nof the inclined bar as traced by the metal-rich red-clump stars. The number\ndensity for population II Cepheids is more limited as compared to abundant RR\nLyraes but they are bright and exhibit a wide range in period that provides a\nrobust period-luminosity relation for an accurate estimate of the distance to\nthe Galactic center.\n", "  The architecture of many exoplanetary systems is different from the solar\nsystem, with exoplanets being in close orbits around their host stars and\nhaving orbital periods of only a few days. We can expect interactions between\nthe star and the exoplanet for such systems that are similar to the tidal\ninteractions observed in close stellar binary systems. For the exoplanet, tidal\ninteraction can lead to circularization of its orbit and the synchronization of\nits rotational and orbital period. For the host star, it has long been\nspeculated if significant angular momentum transfer can take place between the\nplanetary orbit and the stellar rotation. In the case of the Earth-Moon system,\nsuch tidal interaction has led to an increasing distance between Earth and\nMoon. For stars with Hot Jupiters, where the orbital period of the exoplanet is\ntypically shorter than the stellar rotation period, one expects a decreasing\nsemimajor axis for the planet and enhanced stellar rotation, leading to\nincreased stellar activity. Also excess turbulence in the stellar convective\nzone due to rising and subsiding tidal bulges may change the magnetic activity\nwe observe for the host star. Here I review recent observational results on\nstellar activity and tidal interaction in the presence of close-in exoplanets,\nand discuss the effects of enhanced stellar activity on the exoplanets in such\nsystems.\n", "  The one-dimensional pair contact process with diffusion (PCPD), an\ninteracting particle system with diffusion, pair annihilation, and creation by\npairs, has defied a consensus about the universality class that it belongs to.\nAn argument by Hinrichsen [H. Hinrichsen, Physica A {\\bf 361}, 457 (2006)]\nclaims that freely diffusing particles in the PCPD should play the same role as\nfrozen particles, when it comes to the critical behavior. Therefore, the PCPD\nis claimed to have the same critical phenomena as a model with infinitely many\nabsorbing states that belongs to the directed percolation (DP) universality\nclass. To investigate if diffusing particles are really indistinguishable from\nfrozen particles in the sense of the renormalization group, we numerically\nstudy a variation of the PCPD by introducing a nonorder field associated with\ninfinitely many absorbing states. We find that a crossover from the PCPD to the\nDP occurs due to the nonorder field. Since, by studying a similar model, we\nexclude the possibility that mere introduction of a nonorder field to one model\ncan entail a nontrivial crossover to another model in the same universality\nclass, we attribute the observed crossover to the difference of the\nuniversality class of the PCPD from the DP class.\n", "  A nova in the Local Group irregular dwarf galaxy IC 1613 was discovered on\n2015 September 10 and is the first nova in that galaxy to be spectroscopically\nconfirmed. We conducted a detailed multi-wavelength observing campaign of the\neruption with the Liverpool Telescope, the LCO 2m telescope at Siding Spring\nObservatory, and Swift, the results of which we present here. The nova peaked\nat $M_V=-7.93\\pm0.08$ and was fast-fading, with decline times of\n$t_{2(V)}=13\\pm2$ and $t_{3(V)}=26\\pm2$ days. The overall light curve decline\nwas relatively smooth, as often seen in fast-fading novae. Swift observations\nspanned 40 days to 332 days post-discovery, but no X-ray source was detected.\nOptical spectra show the nova to be a member of the hybrid spectroscopic class,\nsimultaneously showing Fe II and N II lines of similar strength during the\nearly decline phase. The spectra cover the eruption from the early optically\nthick phase, through the early decline and into the nebular phase. The\nH$\\gamma$ absorption minimum from the optically thick spectrum indicates an\nexpansion velocity of $1200\\pm200$ km s$^{-1}$. The FWHM of the H$\\alpha$\nemission line between 10.54 and 57.51 days post-discovery shows no significant\nevolution and remains at $\\sim1750$ km s$^{-1}$, although the morphology of\nthis line does show some evolution. The nova appears close to a faint stellar\nsource in archival imaging, however we find the most likely explanation for\nthis is simply a chance alignment.\n", "  We report magnetotransport measurements of PrSb in high magnetic fields. Our\nresults show that PrSb exhibits extremely large magnetoresistance(XMR) at low\ntemperatures. Meanwhile angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements were\nused to probe the Fermi surface via Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations. The\nangular dependence of the frequencies of the $\\alpha$-branch indicate a\ntwo-dimensional character for this Fermi surface sheet, while the effective\nmass of this branch as a function of angle shows a four-fold signature. The\nevolution of the Fermi surface with field was also studied up to 32~T. An\nenlargement of the Fermi surface up to 14~T is observed, before the oscillation\nfrequencies become constant at higher fields. Meanwhile our analysis of the\nresidual Landau index from the high field data reveals a zero Berry phase and\ntherefore trivial topology of the Fermi surface.\n", "  HESS J0632+057 is the only gamma-ray binary that has been detected at TeV\nenergies, but not at GeV energies yet. Based on nearly nine years of Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) Pass 8 data, we report here on a deep search for the\ngamma-ray emission from HESS J0632+057 in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range. We find\na previously unknown gamma-ray source, Fermi J0632.6+0548, spatially coincident\nwith HESS J0632+057. The measured flux of Fermi J0632.6+0548 is consistent with\nthe previous flux upper limit on HESS J0632+057 and shows variability that can\nbe related to the HESS J0632+057 orbital phase. We propose that Fermi\nJ0632.6+0548 is the GeV counterpart of HESS J0632+057. Considering the Very\nHigh Energy (VHE) spectrum of HESS J0632+057, a possible spectral turnover\nabove 10 GeV may exist in Fermi J0632.6+0548, as appears to be common in other\nestablished gamma-ray binaries.\n", "  The \"VISTA near-infrared YJKs survey of the Magellanic System\" (VMC) is\ncollecting deep Ks-band time-series photometry of pulsating stars hosted by the\ntwo Magellanic Clouds and their connecting Bridge. Here we present YJKs light\ncurves for a sample of 717 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) Classical Cepheids\n(CCs). These data, complemented with our previous results and V magnitude from\nliterature, allowed us to construct a variety of period-luminosity and\nperiod-Wesenheit relationships, valid for Fundamental, First and Second\nOvertone pulsators. These relations provide accurate individual distances to\nCCs in the SMC over an area of more than 40 sq. deg. Adopting literature\nrelations, we estimated ages and metallicities for the majority of the\ninvestigated pulsators, finding that: i) the age distribution is bimodal, with\ntwo peaks at 120+-10 and 220+-10 Myr; ii) the more metal-rich CCs appear to be\nlocated closer to the centre of the galaxy. Our results show that the\nthree-dimensional distribution of the CCs in the SMC, is not planar but heavily\nelongated for more than 25-30 kpc approximately in the east/north-east towards\nsouth-west direction. The young and old CCs in the SMC show a different\ngeometric distribution. Our data support the current theoretical scenario\npredicting a close encounter or a direct collision between the Clouds some 200\nMyr ago and confirm the presence of a Counter-Bridge predicted by some models.\nThe high precision three-dimensional distribution of young stars presented in\nthis paper provides a new testbed for future models exploring the formation and\nevolution of the Magellanic System.\n", "  Statistical pattern recognition methods have provided competitive solutions\nfor variable star classification at a relatively low computational cost. In\norder to perform supervised classification, a set of features is proposed and\nused to train an automatic classification system. Quantities related to the\nmagnitude density of the light curves and their Fourier coefficients have been\nchosen as features in previous studies. However, some of these features are not\nrobust to the presence of outliers and the calculation of Fourier coefficients\nis computationally expensive for large data sets. We propose and evaluate the\nperformance of a new robust set of features using supervised classifiers in\norder to look for new Be star candidates in the OGLE-IV Gaia south ecliptic\npole field. We calculated the proposed set of features on six types of variable\nstars and on a set of Be star candidates reported in the literature. We\nevaluated the performance of these features using classification trees and\nrandom forests along with K-nearest neighbours, support vector machines, and\ngradient boosted trees methods. We tuned the classifiers with a 10-fold\ncross-validation and grid search. We validated the performance of the best\nclassifier on a set of OGLE-IV light curves and applied this to find new Be\nstar candidates. The random forest classifier outperformed the others. By using\nthe random forest classifier and colour criteria we found 50 Be star candidates\nin the direction of the Gaia south ecliptic pole field, four of which have\ninfrared colours consistent with Herbig Ae/Be stars. Supervised methods are\nvery useful in order to obtain preliminary samples of variable stars extracted\nfrom large databases. As usual, the stars classified as Be stars candidates\nmust be checked for the colours and spectroscopic characteristics expected for\nthem.\n", "  Covalently linked acene dimers are of interest as candidates for\nintramolecular singlet fission. We report many-electron calculations of the\nenergies and wavefunctions of the optical singlets, the lowest triplet exciton\nand the triplet-triplet biexciton, as well as the final states of excited state\nabsorptions from these states in a family of phenyl-linked pentacene dimers.\nWhile it is difficult to distinguish between the triplet and the\ntriplet-triplet from their transient absorptions in the 500-600 nm region, by\ncomparing theoretical transient absorption spectra against published and\nunpublished experimental transient absorptions in the near and mid infrared we\nconclude that the end product of photoexcitation in these particular\nbipentacenes is the bound triplet-triplet and not free triplets. We predict\nadditional transient absorptions at even longer wavelengths, beyond 1500 nm, to\nthe equivalent of the classic 2$^1$A$_g^-$ in linear polyenes.\n", "  We address the linear stability of a discontinuous surface of a relativistic\nflow in the context of a jet that oscillates radially as it propagates. The\nrestoring force of the oscillation is expected to drive a Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability (RTI) at the interface between the jet and its cocoon. We perform a\nlinear analysis and numerical simulations of the growth of the RTI in the\ntransverse plane to the jet flow with a uniform acceleration. In this system,\nan inertia force due to the uniform acceleration acts as the restoring force\nfor the oscillation. We find that not only the difference in the inertia\nbetween the two fluids separated by the interface but also the pressure at the\ninterface helps to drive the RTI because of a difference in the Lorenz factor\nacross the discontinuous surface of the jet. The dispersion relation indicates\nthat the linear growth rate of each mode becomes maximum when the Lorentz\nfactor of the jet is much larger than that of the cocoon and the pressure at\nthe jet interface is relativistic. By comparing the linear growth rates of the\nRTI in the analytical model and the numerical simulations, the validity of our\nanalytically derived dispersion relation for the relativistic RTI is confirmed.\n", "  The Rosette Nebula is an HII region ionized mainly by the stellar cluster NGC\n2244. Elephant trunks, globules, and globulettes are seen at the interface\nwhere the HII region and the surrounding molecular shell meet. We have observed\na field in the northwestern part of the Rosette Nebula where we study the small\nglobules protruding from the shell. Our aim is to measure their properties and\nstudy their star formation history in continuation of our earlier study of the\nfeatures of the region. We imaged the region in broadband near-infrared (NIR)\nJsHKs filters and narrowband H2 1-0 S(1), P$\\beta$, and continuum filters using\nthe SOFI camera at the ESO/NTT. The imaging was used to study the stellar\npopulation and surface brightness, create visual extinction maps, and locate\nstar formation. Mid-infrared (MIR) Spitzer IRAC and WISE and optical NOT images\nwere used to further study the star formation and the structure of the\nglobules. The NIR and MIR observations indicate an outflow, which is confirmed\nwith CO observations made with APEX. The globules have mean number densities of\n~$4.6\\times10^4 \\rm cm^{-3}$. P$\\beta$ is seen in absorption in the cores of\nthe globules where we measure visual extinctions of 11-16 mag. The shell and\nthe globules have bright rims in the observed bands. In the Ks band 20 to 40%\nof the emission is due to fluorescent emission in the 2.12 $\\mu$m H2 line\nsimilar to the tiny dense globulettes we studied earlier in a nearby region. We\nidentify several stellar NIR excess candidates and four of them are also\ndetected in the Spitzer IRAC 8.0 $\\mu$m image and studied further. We find an\noutflow with a cavity wall bright in the 2.124 $\\mu$m H2 line and at 8.0 $\\mu$m\nin one of the globules. The outflow originates from a Class I young stellar\nobject (YSO) embedded deep inside the globule. An H$\\alpha$ image suggests the\nYSO drives a possible parsec-scale outflow. (abridged)\n", "  In this paper a study of the accelerated expansion problem of the large scale\nuniverse is presented. To derive Friedmann like equations, describing the\nbackground dynamics of the recent universe we take into account, that it is\npossibile to interpret the spacetime dynamics as an emergent phenomenon. It is\na consequence of the deep study of connection between gravitation and\nthermodynamics. Considered models are based on phenomenological modifications\nof the horizon temperature. In general, there are various reasons to modify the\nhorizon temperature and one of them can be related to the feedback from the\nspacetime on the horizon, which will generate additional heat. In order to\nconstraint the parameters of the models we use $Om$ analysis and the\nconstraints on this parameter at $z=0.0$, $z=0,57$ and $z=2.34$.\n", "  We study the transverse momentum spectrum of dilepton produced in the\nunpolarized $\\pi^- N$ Drell-Yan process, using transverse momentum dependent\nfactorization up to next-to-logarithmic order of QCD. We extract the\nnonperturbative Sudakov form factor for the pion in the evolution formalism of\nthe unpolarized TMD distribution function, by fitting the experimental data\ncollected by the E615 Collaboration at Fermilab. With the extracted Sudakov\nfactor, we calculate the normalized differential cross section with respect to\ntransverse momentum of the dimuon and compare it with the recent measurement by\nthe COMPASS Collaboration.\n", "  Large modern surveys require efficient review of data in order to find\ntransient sources such as supernovae, and to distinguish such sources from\nartefacts and noise. Much effort has been put into the development of automatic\nalgorithms, but surveys still rely on human review of targets. This paper\npresents an integrated system for the identification of supernovae in data from\nPan-STARRS1, combining classifications from volunteers participating in a\ncitizen science project with those from a convolutional neural network. The\nunique aspect of this work is the deployment, in combination, of both human and\nmachine classifications for near real-time discovery in an astronomical\nproject. We show that the combination of the two methods outperforms either one\nused individually. This result has important implications for the future\ndevelopment of transient searches, especially in the era of LSST and other\nlarge-throughput surveys.\n", "  We determine the magnetic field strength in the OMC 1 region of the Orion A\nfilament via a new implementation of the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method using\nobservations performed as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT)\nB-Fields In Star-Forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey with the POL-2\ninstrument. We combine BISTRO data with archival SCUBA-2 and HARP observations\nto find a plane-of-sky magnetic field strength in OMC 1 of $B_{\\rm\npos}=6.6\\pm4.7$ mG, where $\\delta B_{\\rm pos}=4.7$ mG represents a\npredominantly systematic uncertainty. We develop a new method for measuring\nangular dispersion, analogous to unsharp masking. We find a magnetic energy\ndensity of $\\sim1.7\\times 10^{-7}$ Jm$^{-3}$ in OMC 1, comparable both to the\ngravitational potential energy density of OMC 1 ($\\sim 10^{-7}$ Jm$^{-3}$), and\nto the energy density in the Orion BN/KL outflow ($\\sim 10^{-7}$ Jm$^{-3}$). We\nfind that neither the Alfv\\'{e}n velocity in OMC 1 nor the velocity of the\nsuper-Alfv\\'{e}nic outflow ejecta is sufficiently large for the BN/KL outflow\nto have caused large-scale distortion of the local magnetic field in the\n$\\sim$500-year lifetime of the outflow. Hence, we propose that the hour-glass\nfield morphology in OMC 1 is caused by the distortion of a primordial\ncylindrically-symmetric magnetic field by the gravitational fragmentation of\nthe filament and/or the gravitational interaction of the BN/KL and S clumps. We\nfind that OMC 1 is currently in or near magnetically-supported equilibrium, and\nthat the current large-scale morphology of the BN/KL outflow is regulated by\nthe geometry of the magnetic field in OMC 1, and not vice versa.\n", "  Tracking the thermal evolution of plasmas, characterized by an\nn-distribution, using numerical simulations, requires the determination of the\nemission spectra and of the radiative losses due to free-free emission from the\ncorrespond- ing temperature averaged and total Gaunt factors. Detailed\ncalculations of the latter are presented, associated to n-distributed electrons\nwith the parameter n ranging from 1 (corresponding to the Maxwell-Boltzmann\ndistribu- tion) to 100. The temperature averaged and total Gaunt factors, with\ndecreasing n tend to those obtained with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.\nRadiative losses due to free-free emission in a plasma evolving under\ncollisional ionization equilibrium conditions and composed by H, He, C, N, O,\nNe, Mg, Si, S, and Fe ions, are presented. These losses decrease with the\ndecrease in the parameter n reaching a minimum when n = 1, and, thus converging\nto the losses of a thermal plasma.\n  Tables of the thermal averaged and total Gaunt factors calculated for n\ndistributions and a wide range electron and photon energies are presented.\n", "  We present the first spectroscopic measurement of multiple rest-frame optical\nemission lines at $z>4$. During the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF)\nsurvey, we observed the galaxy GOODSN-17940 with the Keck I/MOSFIRE\nspectrograph. The K-band spectrum of GOODSN-17940 includes significant\ndetections of the [OII]$\\lambda\\lambda 3726,3729$, [NeIII]$\\lambda3869$, and\nH$\\gamma$ emission lines and a tentative detection of H$\\delta$, indicating\n$z_{\\rm{spec}}=4.4121$. GOODSN-17940 is an actively star-forming $z>4$ galaxy\nbased on its K-band spectrum and broadband spectral energy distribution. A\nsignificant excess relative to the surrounding continuum is present in the\nSpitzer/IRAC channel 1 photometry of GOODSN-17940, due primarily to strong\nH$\\alpha$ emission with a rest-frame equivalent width of\n$\\mbox{EW(H}\\alpha)=1200$ \\AA. Based on the assumption of $0.5 Z_{\\odot}$\nmodels and the Calzetti attenuation curve, GOODSN-17940 is characterized by\n$M_*=5.0^{+4.3}_{-0.2}\\times 10^9 M_{\\odot}$. The Balmer decrement inferred\nfrom H$\\alpha$/H$\\gamma$ is used to dust correct the H$\\alpha$ emission,\nyielding $\\mbox{SFR(H}\\alpha)=320^{+190}_{-140} M_{\\odot}\\mbox{ yr}^{-1}$.\nThese $M_*$ and SFR values place GOODSN-17940 an order of magnitude in SFR\nabove the $z\\sim 4$ star-forming \"main sequence.\" Finally, we use the observed\nratio of [NeIII]/[OII] to estimate the nebular oxygen abundance in\nGOODSN-17940, finding $\\mbox{O/H}\\sim 0.2 \\mbox{ (O/H)}_{\\odot}$. Combining our\nnew [NeIII]/[OII] measurement with those from stacked spectra at $z\\sim 0, 2,\n\\mbox{ and } 3$, we show that GOODSN-17940 represents an extension to $z>4$ of\nthe evolution towards higher [NeIII]/[OII] (i.e., lower $\\mbox{O/H}$) at fixed\nstellar mass. It will be possible to perform the measurements presented here\nout to $z\\sim 10$ using the James Webb Space Telescope.\n", "  Trends observed in galaxies, such as the Gao \\& Solomon relation, suggest a\nlinear relation between the star formation rate and the mass of dense gas\navailable for star formation. Validation of such relations requires the\nestablishment of reliable methods to trace the dense gas in galaxies. One\nfrequent assumption is that the HCN ($J=1$--0) transition is unambiguously\nassociated with gas at $\\rm{}H_2$ densities $\\gg{}10^4~\\rm{}cm^{-3}$. If so,\nthe mass of gas at densities $\\gg{}10^4~\\rm{}cm^{-3}$ could be inferred from\nthe luminosity of this emission line, $L_{\\rm{}HCN\\,(1\\text{--}0)}$. Here we\nuse observations of the Orion~A molecular cloud to show that the HCN ($J=1$--0)\nline traces much lower densities $\\sim{}10^3~\\rm{}cm^{-3}$ in cold sections of\nthis molecular cloud, corresponding to visual extinctions\n$A_V\\approx{}6~\\rm{}mag$. We also find that cold and dense gas in a cloud like\nOrion produces too little HCN emission to explain $L_{\\rm{}HCN\\,(1\\text{--}0)}$\nin star--forming galaxies, suggesting that galaxies might contain a hitherto\nunknown source of HCN emission. In our sample of molecules observed at\nfrequencies near 100~GHz (also including $\\rm{}^{12}CO$, $\\rm{}^{13}CO$,\n$\\rm{}C^{18}O$, CN, and CCH), $\\rm{}N_2H^+$ is the only species clearly\nassociated with rather dense gas.\n", "  Effective cavities can be optically-induced in atomic media and employed to\nstrengthen optical nonlinearities. Here we study the integration of induced\ncavities with a photonic quantum gate based on Rydberg blockade. Accounting for\nloss in the atomic medium, we calculate the corresponding finesse and gate\ninfidelity. Our analysis shows that the conventional limits imposed by the\nblockade optical depth are mitigated by the induced cavity in long media, thus\nestablishing the total optical depth of the medium as a complementary resource.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the biased sub-Ohmic spin-boson model by means of a\ntime-dependent variational matrix product state (TDVMPS) algorithm. The\nevolution of both the system and the environment is obtained in the weak- and\nthe strong-coupling regimes, respectively characterized by damped spin\noscillations and by a nonequilibrium process where the spin freezes near its\ninitial state, which are explicitly shown to arise from a variety of reactive\nenvironmental quantum dynamics. We also explore the rich phenomenology of the\nintermediate-coupling case, a nonperturbative regime where the system shows a\ncomplex dynamical behavior, combining features of both the weakly and the\nstrongly coupled case in a sequential, time-retarded fashion. Our work\ndemonstrates the potential of TDVMPS methods for exploring otherwise elusive,\nnonperturbative regimes of complex open quantum systems, and points to the\npossibilities of exploiting the qualitative, real-time modification of quantum\nproperties induced by nonequilibrium bath dynamics in ultrafast transient\nprocesses.\n", "  We report on observations made with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on\nthe Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using background QSOs to probe the\ncircum-galactic medium (CGM) around 17 low-redshift galaxies that are\nundergoing or have recently undergone a strong starburst (the COS-Burst\nprogram). The sightlines extend out to roughly the virial radius of the galaxy\nhalo. We construct control samples of normal star-forming low-redshift galaxies\nfrom the COS/HST archive that match the starbursts in terms of galaxy stellar\nmass and impact parameter.\n  We find clear evidence that the CGM around the starbursts differs\nsystematically compared to the control galaxies. The Ly$\\alpha$, Si III, C IV,\nand possibly O VI absorption-lines are stronger as a function of impact\nparameter, and the ratios of the equivalent widths of C IV/Ly$\\alpha$ and Si\nIII/Ly$\\alpha$ are both larger than in normal star-forming galaxies. We also\nfind that the widths and the velocity offsets (relative to $v_{sys}$) of the\nLy$\\alpha$ absorption-lines are significantly larger in the CGM of the\nstarbursts, implying velocities of the absorbing material that are roughly\ntwice the halo virial velocity.\n  We show that these properties can be understood as a consequence of the\ninteraction between a starburst-driven wind and the pre-existing CGM. These\nresults underscore the importance of winds driven from intensely star-forming\ngalaxies in helping drive the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic\nmedium. They also offer a new probe of the properties of starburst-driven winds\nand of the CGM itself.\n", "  Kepler allows the measurement of starspot variability in a large sample of\nfield red giants for the first time. With a new method that combines\nautocorrelation and wavelet decomposition, we measure 361 rotation periods from\nthe full set of 17,377 oscillating red giants in our sample. This represents\n2.08% of the stars, consistent with the fraction of spectroscopically detected\nrapidly rotating giants in the field. The remaining stars do not show enough\nvariability to allow us to measure a reliable surface rotation period. Because\nthe stars with detected rotation periods have measured oscillations, we can\ninfer their global properties, e.g. mass and radius, and quantitatively\nevaluate the predictions of standard stellar evolution models as a function of\nmass. Consistent with results for cluster giants when we consider only the 4881\nintermediate-mass stars, M>2.0 M$_\\odot$ from our full red giant sample, we do\nnot find the enhanced rates of rapid rotation expected from angular momentum\nconservation. We therefore suggest that either enhanced angular momentum loss\nor radial differential rotation must be occurring in these stars. Finally, when\nwe examine the 575 low-mass (M<1.1 M$_\\odot$) red clump stars in our sample,\nwhich were expected to exhibit slow (non-detectable) rotation, 15% of them\nactually have detectable rotation. This suggests a high rate of interactions\nand stellar mergers on the red giant branch.\n", "  We define a stochastic lattice model for a fluctuating directed polymer in\n$d\\geq 2$ dimensions. This model can be alternatively interpreted as a\nfluctuating random path in 2 dimensions, or a one-dimensional asymmetric simple\nexclusion process with $d-1$ conserved species of particles. The deterministic\nlarge dynamics of the directed polymer are shown to be given by a system of\ncoupled Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equations and diffusion equations. Using\nnon-linear fluctuating hydrodynamics and mode coupling theory we argue that\nstationary fluctuations in any dimension $d$ can only be of KPZ type or\ndiffusive. The modes are pure in the sense that there are only subleading\ncouplings to other modes, thus excluding the occurrence of modified\nKPZ-fluctuations or L\\'evy-type fluctuations which are common for more than one\nconservation law. The mode-coupling matrices are shown to satisfy the so-called\ntrilinear condition.\n", "  We use Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of\nH30$\\alpha$ (231.90 GHz) emission from the low metallicity dwarf galaxy NGC\n5253 to measure the star formation rate (SFR) within the galaxy and to test the\nreliability of SFRs derived from other commonly-used metrics. The H30$\\alpha$\nemission, which originates mainly from the central starburst, yields a\nphotoionizing photon production rate of (1.9$\\pm$0.3)$\\times$10$^{52}$ s$^{-1}$\nand an SFR of 0.087$\\pm$0.013 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ based on conversions that\naccount for the low metallicity of the galaxy and for stellar rotation. Among\nthe other star formation metrics we examined, the SFR calculated from the total\ninfrared flux was statistically equivalent to the values from the H30$\\alpha$\ndata. The SFR based on previously-published versions of the H$\\alpha$ flux that\nwere extinction corrected using Pa$\\alpha$ and Pa$\\beta$ lines were lower than\nbut also statistically similar to the H30$\\alpha$ value. The mid-infrared (22\n$\\mu$m) flux density and the composite star formation tracer based on H$\\alpha$\nand mid-infrared emission give SFRs that were significantly higher because the\ndust emission appears unusually hot compared to typical spiral galaxies.\nConversely, the 70 and 160 $\\mu$m flux densities yielded SFR lower than the\nH30$\\alpha$ value, although the SFRs from the 70 $\\mu$m and H30$\\alpha$ data\nwere within 1-2$\\sigma$ of each other. While further analysis on a broader\nrange of galaxies are needed, these results are instructive of the best and\nworst methods to use when measuring SFR in low metallicity dwarf galaxies like\nNGC 5253.\n", "  The newest generation of integral field unit spectrographs brings\nthree-dimensional mapping of nearby galaxies one step closer. While the focus\nup to this point was mostly on stars and ionised gas, it is also possible to\nlook at dust in a new, more complete way. Using MUSE science verification\nobservations of NGC 5626, we map the interstellar matter in this dusty\nlenticular. We use the resolving power of MUSE to measure the optical\nattenuation with a spectral resolution of 6.25 \\AA, at physical scales of 0.1-1\nkpc. The integrated attenuation curve of NGC 5626 shows a smooth, slightly\nsteeper than Milky Way and SMC attenuation curves. Several sharp features are\nsuperimposed: we measure lower attenuation at spectral emission lines and\nhigher attenuation for the sodium line doublet. No correlation was observed\nbetween sodium line strength and reddening by dust on spatially resolved\nscales. Additionally, the continuum attenuation was found to be independent\nfrom the Balmer decrement (tracing ionised gas attenuation). We model and\ninterpret the variations in the attenuation curves of each spatial resolution\nelement of NGC 5626. We find that the amount and distribution of dust along the\nline-of-sight is highly degenerate with any variation in the intrinsic\nextinction law. Our analysis shows that the interstellar matter in NGC 5626\nresides in a regular and well-settled disk. Our results preach caution in the\napplication of simple recipes to de-redden global galaxy spectra and underlines\nthe need for more realistic dust geometries when constructing such correction\nformulas.\n", "  We present a consistent embedding of the matter and gauge content of the\nStandard Model into an underlying asymptotically-safe theory, that has a\nwell-determined in- teracting UV fixed point in the large colour/flavour limit.\nThe scales of symmetry breaking are determined by two mass-squared parameters\nwith the breaking of elec- troweak symmetry being driven radiatively. There are\nno other free parameters in the theory apart from gauge couplings.\n", "  We describe and test a novel Dark Matter Annihilation Feedback (DMAF) scheme\nthat has been implemented into the well known cosmological simulation code\n\\textsf{GADGET-2}. In the models considered here, dark matter can undergo\nself-annihilation/decay into radiation and baryons. These products deposit\nenergy into the surrounding gas particles and then the dark matter/baryon fluid\nis self-consistently evolved under gravity and hydrodynamics. We present tests\nof this new feedback implementation in the case of idealised dark matter halos\nwith gas components for a range of halo masses, concentrations and annihilation\nrates. For some dark matter models, DMAF's ability to evacuate gas is enhanced\nin lower mass, concentrated halos where the injected energy is comparable to\nits gravitational binding energy. Therefore, we expect the strongest signs of\ndark matter annihilation to imprint themselves onto the baryonic structure of\nconcentrated dwarf galaxies through their baryonic fraction and star formation\nhistory. Finally we present preliminary results of the first self-consistent\nDMAF cosmological box simulations showing that the small scale substructure is\nwashed out for large annihilation rates.\n", "  We study in detail the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, i.e. the\ninfinite-range Ising spin glass in a transverse field, by solving numerically\nthe effective one-dimensional model that the quantum SK model can be mapped to\nin the thermodynamic limit. We find that the replica symmetric (RS) solution is\nunstable down to zero temperature, in contrast to some previous claims, and so\nthere is not only a line of transitions in the (longitudinal) field-temperature\nplane (the de Almeida-Thouless, AT, line) where replica symmetry is broken, but\nalso a quantum de Almeida-Thouless (QuAT) line in the transverse\nfield-longitudinal field plane at $T = 0$. If the QuAT line also occurs in\nmodels with short-range interactions its presence might affect the performance\nof quantum annealers when solving spin glass-type problems with a bias (i.e.\nmagnetic field).\n", "  We investigate the evolution of mass segregation in initially sub-structured\nyoung embedded star clusters with two different background potentials mimicking\nthe gas. Our clusters are initially in virial or sub-virial global states and\nhave different initial distributions for the most massive stars: randomly\nplaced, initially mass segregated or even inverse segregation. By means of\nN-body simulation we follow their evolution for 5 Myr. We measure the mass\nsegregation using the minimum spanning tree method Lambda_MSR and an equivalent\nrestricted method. Despite this variety of different initial conditions, we\nfind that our stellar distributions almost always settle very fast into a mass\nsegregated and more spherical configuration, suggesting that once we see a\nspherical or nearly spherical embedded star cluster, we can be sure it is mass\nsegregated no matter what the real initial conditions were. We, furthermore,\nreport under which circumstances this process can be more rapid or delayed,\nrespectively.\n", "  We investigate the half-life expectations for neutrinoless double beta decay\nby applying statistical distributions of neutrino mixing observables, neutrino\nmass constraints from cosmology and nuclear matrix elements. The analysis is\nperformed in the standard scenario of active Majorana neutrino exchange, when\nlight sterile neutrinos are added, and within TeV-scale left-right symmetric\nframeworks. The latter two cases correspond to a modified phenomenology of\ndouble beta decay for a normal and inverted mass ordering, and thus different\ndiscovery potential for future experiments.\n", "  Barnard 207 (B207, LDN 1489, LBN 777), also known as the Vulture Head nebula,\nis a cometary globule in the Taurus-Auriga-Perseus molecular cloud region. B207\nis known to host a Class I protostar, IRAS 04016+2610, located at a projected\ndistance of ~8,400 au from the dense core centre. Using imaging and photometry\nover a wide wavelength range, from UV to sub-mm, we study the physical\nproperties of B207 and the dust grains contained within. The core density,\ntemperature, and mass are typical of other globules found in the Milky Way\ninterstellar medium (ISM). The increase in the dust albedo with increasing\noptical wavelengths, along with the detection of coreshine in the near\ninfrared, indicates the presence of larger dust grains in B207. The measured\noptical, near-, mid- and far-infrared intensities are in agreement with the\nCMM+AMM and CMM+AMMI dust grain type of The Heterogeneous dust Evolution Model\nfor Interstellar Solids (THEMIS), suggesting mantle formation on the dust\ngrains throughout the globule. We investigate the possibility of turbulence\nbeing responsible for diffusing dust grains from the central core to external\nouter layers of B207. However, in situ formation of large dust grains cannot be\nexcluded.\n", "  This work examines the effect of the embedded magnetic field strength on the\nnon-linear development of the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) (with\na field-aligned interface) in an ideal gas close to the incompressible limit in\nthree dimensions. Numerical experiments are conducted in a domain sufficiently\nlarge so as to allow the predicted critical modes to develop in a physically\nrealistic manner. The ratio between gravity, which drives the instability in\nthis case (as well as in several of the corresponding observations), and\nmagnetic field strength is taken up to a ratio which accurately reflects that\nof observed astrophysical plasma, in order to allow comparison between the\nresults of the simulations and the observational data which served as\ninspiration for this work. This study finds reduced non-linear growth of the\nrising bubbles of the RTI for stronger magnetic fields, and that this is\ndirectly due to the change in magnetic field strength, rather than the indirect\neffect of altering characteristic length scales with respect to domain size. By\nexamining the growth of the falling spikes, the growth rate appears to be\nenhanced for the strongest magnetic field strengths, suggesting that rather\nthan affecting the development of the system as a whole, increased magnetic\nfield strengths in fact introduce an asymmetry to the system. Further\ninvestigation of this effect also revealed that the greater this asymmetry, the\nless efficiently the gravitational energy is released. By better understanding\nthe under-studied regime of such a major phenomenon in astrophysics, deeper\nexplanations for observations may be sought, and this work illustrates that the\nstrength of magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas influences observed RTI in\nsubtle and complex ways.\n", "  We present an extensive peakbagging effort on Kepler data of $\\sim$50 red\ngiant stars in the open star cluster NGC 6819. By employing sophisticated\npre-processing of the time series and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques we\nextracted individual frequencies, heights and linewidths for hundreds of\noscillation modes.\n  We show that the \"average\" asteroseismic parameter $\\delta\\nu_{02}$, derived\nfrom these, can be used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between\nthe red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars.\n  Masses and radii are estimated using asteroseismic scaling relations, both\nempirically corrected to obtain self-consistency as well as agreement with\nindependent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical corrections.\nRemarkable agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary state of the giants to\nbe determined exclusively from the empirical correction to the scaling\nrelations. We find a mean mass of the RGB stars and RC stars in NGC 6819 to be\n$1.61\\pm0.02\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot$ and $1.64{\\pm}0.02\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot$,\nrespectively. The difference $\\Delta M=-0.03\\pm0.01\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot$ is\nalmost insensitive to systematics, suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if\nany.\n  Stars that are outliers relative to the ensemble reveal overmassive members\nthat likely evolved via mass-transfer in a blue straggler phase. We suggest\nthat KIC 4937011, a low-mass Li-rich giant, is a cluster member in the RC phase\nthat experienced very high mass-loss during its evolution. Such over- and\nundermassive stars need to be considered when studying field giants, since the\ntrue age of such stars cannot be known and there is currently no way to\ndistinguish them from normal stars.\n", "  The second-order Matsubara Green's function method (GF2) is a robust\ntemperature dependent quantum chemistry approach, extending beyond the\nrandom-phase approximation. However, till now the scope of GF2 applications was\nquite limited as they require computer resources which rise steeply with system\nsize. In each step of the self-consistent GF2 calculation there are two parts:\nthe estimation of the self-energy from the previous step's Green's function,\nand updating the Green's function from the self-energy. The first part formally\nscales as the fifth power of the system size while the second has a much\ngentler cubic scaling. Here, we develop a stochastic approach to GF2 (sGF2)\nwhich reduces the fifth power scaling of the first step to merely quadratic,\nleaving the overall sGF2 scaling as cubic. We apply the method to linear\nhydrogen chains containing up to 1000 electrons, showing that the approach is\nnumerically stable, efficient and accurate. The stochastic errors are very\nsmall, of the order of 0.1% or less of the correlation energy for large\nsystems, with only a moderate computational effort. The first iteration of GF2\nis an MP2 calculation that is done in linear scaling, hence we obtain an\nextremely fast stochastic MP2 (sMP2) method as a by-product. While here we\nconsider finite systems with large band gaps where at low temperatures effects\nare negligible, the sGF2 formalism is temperature dependent and general and can\nbe applied to finite or periodic systems with small gaps at finite\ntemperatures.\n", "  We investigated the connection between the mid-infrared (MIR) and optical\nspectral characteristics in a sample of 82 Type 1 active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs), observed with Infrared Spectrometer on Spitzer (IRS) and Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS, DR12). We found several interesting correlations between\noptical and MIR spectral properties: i) as starburst significators in MIR\nincrease, the EWs of optical lines H$\\beta$NLR and FeII, increase as well; ii)\nas MIR spectral index increases, EW([OIII]) decreases, while fractional\ncontribution of AGN (RAGN) is not connected with EW([OIII]); iii) The\nlog([OIII]5007/$\\rm H\\beta$NLR) ratio is weakly related to the fractional\ncontribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (RPAHs). We compare the two\ndifferent MIR and optical diagnostics for starburst contribution to the overall\nradiation (RPAH and BPT diagram, respectively). The significant differences\nbetween optical and MIR starburst diagnostics were found. The starburst\ninfluence to observed correlations between optical and MIR parameters is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present Halpha linear spectropolarimetry of a large sample of Herbig Ae/Be\nstars. Together with newly obtained data for 17 objects, the sample contains 56\nobjects, the largest such sample to date. A change in linear polarization\nacross the Halpha line is detected in 42 (75 %) objects, which confirms the\nprevious finding that the circumstellar environment around these stars on small\nspatial scales has an asymmetric structure, which is typically identified with\na disk. A second outcome of this research is that we confirm that Herbig Ae\nstars are similar to T Tauri stars in displaying a line polarization effect,\nwhile depolarization is more common among Herbig Be stars. This finding had\nbeen suggested previously to indicate that Herbig Ae stars form in the same\nmanner than T Tauri stars through magnetospheric accretion. It appears that the\ntransition between these two differing polarization line effects occurs around\nthe B7-B8 spectral type. This would in turn not only suggest that Herbig Ae\nstars accrete in a similar fashion as lower mass stars, but also that this\naccretion mechanism switches to a different type of accretion for Herbig Be\nstars. We report that the magnitude of the line effect caused by electron\nscattering close to the stars does not exceed 2%. Only a very weak correlation\nis found between the magnitude of the line effect and the spectral type or the\nstrength of the Halpha line. This indicates that the detection of a line effect\nonly relies on the geometry of the line-forming region and the geometry of the\nscattering electrons.\n", "  We study the proximity effect in a one-dimensional nanowire strongly coupled\nto a finite superconductor with a characteristic size which is much shorter\nthan its coherence length. Such geometries have become increasingly relevant in\nrecent years in the experimental search for Majorana fermions with the\ndevelopment of thin epitaxial Al shells which form a very strong contact with\neither InAs or InSb nanowires. So far, however, no theoretical treatment of the\nproximity effect in these systems has accounted for the finite size of the\nsuperconducting film. We show that the finite-size effects become very\ndetrimental when the level spacing of the superconductor greatly exceeds its\nenergy gap. Without any fine-tuning of the size of the superconductor (on the\nscale of the Fermi wavelength), the tunneling energy scale must be larger than\nthe level spacing in order to reach the hard gap regime which is seen\nubiquitously in the experiments. However, in this regime, the large tunneling\nenergy scale induces a large shift in the effective chemical potential of the\nnanowire and pushes the topological phase transition to magnetic field\nstrengths which exceed the critical field of Al.\n", "  Wide-field high precision photometric surveys such as Kepler have produced\nreams of data suitable for investigating stellar magnetic activity of cooler\nstars. Starspot activity produces quasi-sinusoidal light curves whose phase and\namplitude vary as active regions grow and decay over time. Here we investigate,\nfirstly, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed\nto be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay timescale and,\nsecondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective\ntemperature. To determine this, we computed the autocorrelation functions of\nthe light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised\nperiodic functions. The light curve amplitudes, representing spot size were\nmeasured from the root-mean-squared scatter of the normalised light curves. We\nused a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to measure the periods and decay timescales of\nthe light curves. The results show a correlation between the decay time of\nstarspots and their inferred size. The decay time also depends strongly on the\ntemperature of the star. Cooler stars have spots that last much longer, in\nparticular for stars with longer rotational periods. This is consistent with\ncurrent theories of diffusive mechanisms causing starspot decay. We also find\nthat the Sun is not unusually quiet for its spectral type - stars with\nsolar-type rotation periods and temperatures tend to have (comparatively)\nsmaller starspots than stars with mid-G or later spectral types.\n", "  We study the role of running coupling and the effect of variation of the\nthermal quark mass on contribution of the collinear bremsstrahlung and\nannihilation to photon emission in $AA$ collisions in a scheme similar to that\nused in our previous jet quenching analyses. We find that for a scenario with\nthe thermal quark mass $m_q\\sim 50-100$ MeV contribution of the higher order\ncollinear processes summed with the $2\\to 2$ processes can explain a\nconsiderable part ($\\sim 50$\\%) of the experimental photon spectrum at $k_T\\sim\n2-3$ GeV for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=0.2$ TeV. But for $m_q=300$ MeV and\nfor the thermal quark mass predicted by the HTL scheme the theoretical\npredictions underestimate considerably the experimental spectrum.\n", "  We characterize the stellar population of the poorly explored young stellar\ncluster NGC 3293 at the northwestern periphery of the Carina Nebula Complex, in\norder to evaluate the cluster age and the mass function, and to test claims of\nan abnormal IMF and a deficit of M <= 2.5 M_sun stars. We performed a deep (70\nksec) X-ray observation of NGC 3293 with Chandra and detected 1026 individual\nX-ray point sources. We identify counterparts for 74% of the X-ray sources in\ndeep near-infrared images. Our data clearly show that NGC 3293 hosts a large\npopulation of solar-mass stars, refuting claims of a lack of M <= 2.5 M_sun\nstars. The analysis of the color magnitude diagram suggests an age of ~8-10 Myr\nfor the low-mass population of the cluster. There are at least 511 X-ray\ndetected stars with color magnitude positions that are consistent with young\nstellar members within 7 arcmin of the cluster center. The number ratio of\nX-ray detected stars in the 1-2 M_sun range versus the M >= 5 M_sun stars\n(known from optical spectroscopy) is consistent with the expectation from a\nnormal field initial mass function. Most of the early B-type stars and 20% of\nthe later B-type stars are detected as X-ray sources. Our data shows that NGC\n3293 is one of the most populous stellar clusters in the entire Carina Nebula\nComplex. The cluster probably harbored several O-type stars, whose supernova\nexplosions may have had an important impact on the early evolution of the\nCarina Nebula Complex.\n", "  The emission of pure spin currents by mechanical deformations, the\npiezospintronic effect, in antiferromagnets is studied. We characterize the\npiezospintronic effect in an antiferromagnetic honeycomb monolayer in response\nto external strains. It is shown that the strain tensor components can be\nevaluated in terms of the spin Berry phase. In addition, we propose an\nexperimental setup to detect the piezo-spin current generated in the\npiezospintronic material through the inverse spin Hall effect. Our results\napply to a wide family of two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials without\ninversion symmetry, such as the transition-metal chalcogenophosphates materials\nMPX3 (M=V, Mn; X=S, Se, Te) and NiPSe3.\n", "  Carbon enhanced metal poor (CEMP) stars are a particular class of low\nmetalicity halo stars whose chemical analysis may provide important constrains\nto the chemistry evolution of the Galaxy and to the models of mass transfer and\nevolution of components in binary systems. Here, we present a detailed analysis\nof the CEMP star CD-50$^\\circ$776, using high resolution optical spectroscopy.\nWe found that CD-50$^\\circ$776 has a metalicity [Fe/H]=-2.31 and a carbon\nabundance [C/Fe]=+1.21. Analyzing the s-process elements and the europium\nabundances, we show that this star is actually a CEMP-s star, based on the\ncriteria set in the literature to classify these chemically peculiar objects.\nWe also show that CD-50$^\\circ$776 is a lead star, since it has a ratio\n[Pb/Ce]=+0.97. In addition, we show that CD-50$^\\circ$776 develops radial\nvelocity variations that may be attributed to the orbital motion in a binary\nsystem. The abundance pattern of CD-50$^\\circ$776 is discussed and compared to\nother CEMP-s stars already reported in the literature to show that this star is\na quite exceptional object among the CEMP stars, particularly due to its low\nnitrogen abundance. Explaining this pattern may require to improve the\nnucleosynthesis models, and the evolutionary models of mass transfer and binary\ninteraction.\n", "  Computational efficiency demands discretised, hierarchically organised, and\nindividually adaptive time-step sizes (known as the block-step scheme) for the\ntime integration of N-body models. However, most existing N-body codes adapt\nindividual step sizes in a way that violates time symmetry (and symplecticity),\nresulting in artificial secular dissipation (and often secular growth of energy\nerrors). Using single-orbit integrations, I investigate various possibilities\nto reduce or eliminate irreversibility from the time stepping scheme.\nSignificant improvements over the standard approach are possible at little\nextra effort. However, in order to reduce irreversible step-size changes to\nnegligible amounts, such as suitable for long-term integrations of planetary\nsystems, more computational effort is needed, while exact time reversibility\nappears elusive for discretised individual step sizes.\n", "  Large-scale magnetic fields at the surface of massive stars do not only\ninfluence the outer-most layers of the star, but also have consequences for the\ndeep interior, only observationally accessible through asteroseismology. We\nperformed a detailed characterization of the dipolar magnetic field at the\nsurface of the B3.5V star HD 43317, a SPB/$\\beta$ Cep hybrid pulsator, by\nstudying the rotationally modulated magnetic field of archival and new Narval\nspectropolarimetry. Additionally, we employed a grid-based approach to compare\nthe Zeeman signatures with model profiles. By studying the rotational\nmodulation of the He lines in both the Narval and HARPS spectroscopy caused by\nco-rotating surface abundance inhomogeneities, we updated the rotation period\nto $0.897673\\pm0.000004$d. The inclination angle between the rotation axis and\nthe observer's line of sight remains ill-defined, because of the low level of\nvariability in Stokes V and deformations in the intensity profiles by stellar\npulsation modes. The obliquity angle between the rotation and magnetic axes is\nconstrained to $\\beta \\in [67,90]^{\\circ}$, and the strength of the dipolar\nmagnetic field is of the order of 1kG to 1.5kG. This magnetic field at the\nstellar surface is sufficiently strong to warrant a uniformly rotating\nradiative envelope, causing less convective core overshooting, which should be\nvisible in future forward seismic modeling.\n", "  Exploring the properties of strongly correlated systems through quantum\nsimulation with photons, cold atoms or polaritons represents an active area of\nresearch. In fact, the latter permits to shed the light on the behavior of\ncomplex systems which are hardly to be addressed in the laboratory or tackled\nnumerically. In this study we discuss an analogue of graphene formed by\nexciton-polariton spin vortices arranged into a hexagonal lattice. We show how\nthe graphene-type dispersion at different energy scales arises for several\ntypes of exciton-polariton spin vortices. In contrast to previous studies of\nexciton-polaritons in artificial lattices, the use of exciton-polariton spin\nvortex modes offers a more rich playground for quantum simulations. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that the sign of the nearest neighbor coupling\nstrength can be inverted.\n", "  In 2015, Campbell et al. (Nature 523, 322) presented spectroscopic laboratory\ngas phase data for the fullerene cation, C$_{60}^+$, that coincide with\nreported astronomical spectra of two diffuse interstellar band (DIB) features\nat 9633 and 9578 \\AA. In the following year additional laboratory spectra were\nlinked to three other and weaker DIBs at 9428, 9366, and 9349 \\AA. The\nlaboratory data were obtained using wavelength-dependent photodissociation\nspectroscopy of small (up to three) He-tagged C$_{60}^+-$He$_n$ ion complexes,\nyielding rest wavelengths for the bare C$_{60}^+$ cation by correcting for the\nHe-induced wavelength shifts. Here we present an alternative approach to derive\nthe rest wavelengths of the four most prominent C$_{60}^+$ absorption features,\nusing high resolution laser dissociation spectroscopy of C$_{60}^+$ embedded in\nultracold He droplets. Accurate wavelengths of the bare fullerene cation are\nderived based on linear wavelength shifts recorded for He$_n$C$_{60}^+$ species\nwith $n$ up to 32. A careful analysis of all available data results in precise\nrest wavelengths (in air) for the four most prominent C$_{60}^+$ bands:\n9631.9(1) \\AA, 9576.7(1) \\AA, 9427.5(1) \\AA, and 9364.9(1) \\AA. The\ncorresponding band widths have been derived and the relative band intensity\nratios are discussed.\n", "  We present temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements of CO,\nCH$_4$, O$_2$ and CO$_2$ from the forsterite(010) surface in the sub-monolayer\nand multilayer coverage regimes. In the case of CO, CH$_4$ and O$_2$,\nmultilayer growth begins prior to saturation of the monolayer peak, resulting\nin two clearly distinguishable desorption peaks. On the other hand a single\npeak for CO$_2$ is observed which shifts from high temperature at low coverage\nto low temperature at high coverages, sharpening upon multilayer formation. The\nleading edges are aligned for all the molecules in the multilayer coverage\nregime indicating zero order desorption. We have extracted multilayer\ndesorption energies for these molecules using an Arrhenius analysis. For\nsub-monolayer coverages, we observe an extended desorption tail to higher\ntemperature. Inversion analysis has been used to extract the coverage dependent\ndesorption energies in the sub-monolayer coverage regime, from which we obtain\nthe desorption energy distribution. We found that owing to the presence of\nmultiple adsorption energy sites on the crystalline surface the typical\ndesorption energies of these small molecules are significantly larger than\nobtained in previous measurements for several other substrates. Therefore\nmolecules bound to crystalline silicate surfaces may remain locked in the solid\nstate for a longer period of time before desorption into the gas phase.\n", "  We study time evolution of sub-Keplerian transonic accretion flows onto black\nholes using a general relativistic numerical simulation code. We perform\nsimulations in Schwarzschild spacetime. We first compare one-dimensional\nsimulation results with theoretical results and validate the performance of our\ncode. Next, we present results of axisymmetric, two-dimensional simulation of\nadvective flows. We find that even in this case, for which no complete\ntheoretical analysis is present in the literature, steady state shock formation\nis possible.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of GRB 151006A, the first GRB detected by\nAstrosat CZT Imager (CZTI). We study the long term spectral evolution by\nexploiting the capabilities of \\emph{Fermi} and \\emph{Swift} satellites at\ndifferent phases, which is complemented by the polarization measurement with\nthe CZTI. While the light curve of the GRB in different energy bands show a\nsimple pulse profile, the spectrum shows an unusual evolution. The first phase\nexhibits a hard-to-soft (HTS) evolution until $\\sim16-20$\\,s, followed by a\nsudden increase in the spectral peak reaching a few MeV. Such a dramatic change\nin the spectral evolution in case of a single pulse burst is reported for the\nfirst time. This is captured by all models we used namely, Band function,\nBlackbody+Band and two blackbodies+power law. Interestingly, the \\emph{Fermi}\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) also detects its first photon ($>100$\\,MeV) during\nthis time. This new injection of energy may be associated with either the\nbeginning of afterglow phase, or a second hard pulse of the prompt emission\nitself which, however, is not seen in the otherwise smooth pulse profile. By\nconstructing Bayesian blocks and studying the hardness evolution we find a good\nevidence for a second hard pulse. The \\emph{Swift} data at late epochs\n($>T_{90}$ of the GRB) also shows a significant spectral evolution consistent\nwith the early second phase. The CZTI data (100--350\\,keV), though having low\nsignificance ($1\\sigma$), show high values of polarization in the two epochs\n($77\\%$ to $94\\%$), in agreement with our interpretation.\n", "  Based on the secular theory, we discuss the orbital evolution of stars in a\nnuclear star cluster to which a secondary massive black hole is infalling with\nvanishing eccentricity. We find that the eccentricities of the stars could show\nsharp transitions, depending strongly on their initial conditions. By examining\nthe phase-space structure of an associated Hamiltonian, we show that these\ncharacteristic behaviors are partly due to a probabilistic bifurcation at a\nseparatrix crossing, resulting from the retrograde apsidal precession by the\ncluster potential. We also show that separatrix crossings are closely related\nto realization of a large eccentricity and could be important for astrophysical\nphenomena such as tidal disruption events or gravitational wave emissions.\n", "  We present experimental results on the inelastic and elastic interspecies\ninteractions between ytterbium (Yb) in the metastable ${}^3\\mathrm{P}_2$ state\nloaded into a deep optical lattice and spin polarized lithium (Li) in its\nground state. Focusing on the $m_J = 0$ magnetic sublevel of\nYb(${}^3\\mathrm{P}_2$), bias magnetic fields between 20 G and 800 G are\ninvestigated and significantly enhanced inelastic collision rates with high\nmagnetic fields are found. In addition, by direct spectroscopy of the Yb\nMott-insulator immersed in the Li Fermi gas an upper boundary of the background\nscattering length of the Yb(${}^3\\mathrm{P}_2,\nm_J=0$)-Li(${}^2\\mathrm{S}_{1/2}, F=1/2, m_F=+1/2$) system is estimated,\nrevealing the absence of useful Feshbach resonances. These observations are\nqualitatively consistent with the theoretical calculations.\n", "  We note that the diffraction cone shrinkage might result from unitarization\nonly, i.e. there is no need to introduce it into an input amplitude ab initio.\n", "  This research article is a follow up of earlier work by M. Ikram et al.,\nreported in International Journal of Modern Physics E {\\bf{25}}, 1650103 (2016)\nwherein we searched for $\\Lambda$ magic numbers in experimentally confirmed\ndoubly magic nucleonic cores in light to heavy mass region (ie.$^{16}O -\n^{208}Pb$) by injecting $\\Lambda$'s into them. In present manuscript, working\nwithin the state-of-art relativistic mean field theory with inclusion of\n$\\Lambda N$ and $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ interaction in hypernuclei using the predicted\ndoubly magic nucleonic cores ie. $^{292}$120, $^{304}$120, $^{360}$132,\n$^{370}$132, $^{336}$138, $^{396}$138 of elusive superheavy mass regime. In\nanalogy to well established signatures of magicity in conventional nuclear\ntheory, the prediction of hypernuclear magicity are made on the basis of one-,\ntwo-$\\Lambda$ separation energy ($S_\\Lambda, S_{2\\Lambda}$) and two lambda\nshell gaps ($\\delta_{2\\Lambda}$) in multi-$\\Lambda$ hypernuclei. The\ncalculations suggest that the $\\Lambda$ numbers 92, 106, 126, 138, 184, 198,\n240, and 258 might be the $\\Lambda$ shell closures after introducing the\n$\\Lambda$'s in elusive superheavy nucleonic cores. Moreover, in support of\n$\\Lambda$ shell closure the investigation of $\\Lambda$ pairing energy and\neffective $\\Lambda$ pairing gap has also been made. The appearance of new\nlambda shell closures other than the nucleonic ones predicted by various\nrelativistic and non-relativistic theoretical investigations can be attributed\nto the relatively weak strength of spin-orbit coupling in hypernuclei compared\nto normal nuclei.\n", "  We present the analysis of the fundamental plane (FP) for a sample of 19\nmassive red-sequence galaxies ($M_{\\star} >4\\times10^{10} M_{\\odot}$) in 3\nknown overdensities at $1.39<z<1.61$ from the KMOS Cluster Survey, a guaranteed\ntime program with spectroscopy from the K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS)\nat the VLT and imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope. As expected, we find\nthat the FP zero-point in $B$ band evolves with redshift, from the value 0.443\nof Coma to $-0.10\\pm0.09$, $-0.19\\pm0.05$, $-0.29\\pm0.12$ for our clusters at\n$z=1.39$, $z=1.46$, and $z=1.61$, respectively. For the most massive galaxies\n($\\log M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}>11$) in our sample, we translate the FP zero-point\nevolution into a mass-to-light-ratio $M/L$ evolution finding $\\Delta \\log\nM/L_{B}=(-0.46\\pm0.10)z$, $\\Delta \\log M/L_{B}=(-0.52\\pm0.07)z$, to $\\Delta\n\\log M/L_{B}=(-0.55\\pm0.10)z$, respectively. We assess the potential\ncontribution of the galaxies structural and stellar velocity dispersion\nevolution to the evolution of the FP zero-point and find it to be $\\sim$6-35 %\nof the FP zero-point evolution. The rate of $M/L$ evolution is consistent with\ngalaxies evolving passively. By using single stellar population models, we find\nan average age of $2.33^{+0.86}_{-0.51}$ Gyr for the $\\log\nM_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}>11$ galaxies in our massive and virialized cluster at\n$z=1.39$, $1.59^{+1.40}_{-0.62}$ Gyr in a massive but not virialized cluster at\n$z=1.46$, and $1.20^{+1.03}_{-0.47}$ Gyr in a protocluster at $z=1.61$. After\naccounting for the difference in the age of the Universe between redshifts, the\nages of the galaxies in the three overdensities are consistent within the\nerrors, with possibly a weak suggestion that galaxies in the most evolved\nstructure are older.\n", "  We report the synthesis of tetragonal $\\mathrm{FeS}_x\\mathrm{Se}_{1-x}$ films\n($x \\leq 0.78$) by pulsed-laser deposition. To fabricate the tetragonal alloy\nfilms with tetragonal FeSe and hexagonal FeS targets, we adopted an alternate\ndeposition technique with FeSe buffer layer on MgO(001). The overall film\ncomposition is controlled by the thickness ratio of FeS / FeSe layers. The\nout-of-plane lattice parameter of the films follows Vegard's law, demonstrating\nhomogeneous alloying by inter-diffusion. The sulfur solid solubility reaches $x\n= 0.78$ in the $\\mathrm{FeS}_x\\mathrm{Se}_{1-x}$ films, which is by far larger\nthan $x \\approx 0.40$ in bulk governed by the tetragonal phase instability.\n", "  We consider whether the maximum mass of first stars is imposed by the\nprotostellar spin, i.e., by the so-called $\\Omega\\Gamma$-limit, which requires\nthe sum of the radiation and centrifugal forces at the stellar surface be\nsmaller than the inward pull of the gravity. Once the accreting protostar\nreaches such a marginal state, the star cannot spin up more and is not allowed\nto accrete more gas with inward angular momentum flux. So far, however, the\neffect of stellar radiation on the structure of the accretion disk has not been\nproperly taken into account in discussing the effect of $\\Omega\\Gamma$-limit on\nthe first star formation. Here, we obtain a series of the steady accretion-disk\nsolutions considering such effect and find solutions without net angular\nmomentum influx to the stars with arbitrary rotation rates, in addition to\nthose with finite angular momentum flows. The accretion of positive angular\nmomentum flows pushes the star beyond the $\\Omega\\Gamma$-limit, which is\nallowed only with the external pressure provided by the circumstellar disk. On\nthe other hand, the accretion with no net angular momentum influx does not\nresult in the spin-up of the star. Thus, the existence of the solution with no\nnet angular momentum influx indicates that the protostars can keep growing in\nmass by accretion even after they reach the $\\Omega\\Gamma$-limit.\n", "  We interprete the new double charm baryon state found by the LHCb\nCollaboration in the invariant mass distribution of the set of final state\nparticles $(\\Lambda_c^+\\,K^-\\,\\pi^+\\,\\pi^+)$ as being at the origin of the\ndecay chain $\\Xi_{cc}^{++} \\to \\Sigma_c^{++} (\\to \\Lambda_c^+ \\pi^+) +\\bar\nK^{*0} (\\to K^- \\pi^+)$. The nonleptonic decay $\\Xi_{cc}^{++} \\to \\Sigma_c^{++}\n+ \\bar K^{*0}$ belongs to a class of decays where the quark flavor composition\nis such that the decay proceeds solely via the factorizing contribution\nprecluding a contamination from internal $W$-exchange. We use the covariant\nconfined quark model previously developed by us to calculate the four helicity\namplitudes that describe the dynamics of the transition $\\Xi_{cc}^{++} \\to\n\\Sigma_c^{++}$ induced by the effective $(c \\to u)$ current. We then proceed to\ncalculate the rate of the decay as well as the polarization of the\n$\\Sigma_c^{++}$ and $\\Lambda_c^+$ baryons and the longitudinal/transverse\ncomposition of the $\\bar K^{*0}$. We estimate the decay $\\Xi_{cc}^{++} \\to\n\\Sigma_c^{++} \\bar K^{*0}$ to have a branching rate of $B(\\Xi_{cc}^{++} \\to\n\\Sigma_c^{++} \\bar K^{*0}) \\sim 10.5 \\%$. As a byproduct of our investigation\nwe have also analyzed the decay $\\Xi_{cc}^{++} \\to \\Sigma_c^{++} \\bar K^{0}$\nfor which we find a branching ratio of $B(\\Xi_{cc}^{++} \\to \\Sigma_c^{++} \\bar\nK^0) \\sim 2.5 \\%$.\n", "  We investigate the $(\\pi^0,\\eta,\\eta')\\to\\gamma^*\\gamma$ transitions both for\nthe spacelike region and the timelike region using the light-front quark model\n(LFQM). In particular, we present the new direct method to explore the timelike\nregion without resorting to mere analytic continuation from the spacelike\nregion to the timelike region. Our direct calculation in timelike region shows\nthe complete agreement not only with the analytic continuation result from the\nspacelike region but also with the result from the dispersion relation between\nthe real and imaginary parts of the form factor. For the low energy regime, we\ncompare our LFQM results of the transition form factors (TFFs) for the low\ntimelike momentum transfer region and the slope parameters at $q^2=0$ with the\nrecent experimental data from the Dalitz decays of $(\\pi^0,\\eta,\\eta')$. For\nthe high energy regime, we incorporate the QCD factorization in our LFQM to\nexamine the asymptotic behavior of TFFs both for the spacelike region and the\ntimelike region. We compare our results with the available experimental data.\n", "  We have carried out a study of the X-ray properties of the supernova remnant\n(SNR) population in M33 with XMM-Newton, comprising deep observations of 8\nfields in M33 covering all of the area within the D$_{25}$ contours, and with a\ntypical luminosity of 7.1$\\times$10$^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.2-2.0 keV) . Here we\nreport our work to characterize the X-ray properties of the previously\nidentified SNRs in M33, as well as our search for new X-ray detected SNRs. With\nour deep observations and large field of view we have detected 105 SNRs at the\n3$\\sigma$ level, of which 54 SNRs are newly detected in X-rays, and three are\nnewly discovered SNRs. Combining XMM-Newton data with deep Chandra survey data\nallows detailed spectral fitting of 15 SNRs, for which we have measured\ntemperatures, ionization timescales, and individual abundances. This large\nsample of SNRs allows us to construct an X-ray luminosity function, and compare\nits shape to luminosity functions from host galaxies of differing metallicities\nand star formation rates to look for environmental effects on SNR properties.\nWe conclude that while metallicity may play a role in SNR population\ncharacteristics, differing star formation histories on short timescales, and\nsmall-scale environmental effects appear to cause more significant differences\nbetween X-ray luminosity distributions. In addition, we analyze the X-ray\ndetectability of SNRs, and find that in M33 SNRs with higher [SII]/H$\\alpha$\nratios, as well as those with smaller galactocentric distances, are more\ndetectable in X-rays.\n", "  We present measurements of the spin-orbit misalignments of the hot Jupiters\nHAT-P-41 b and WASP-79 b, and the aligned warm Jupiter Kepler-448 b. We\nobtained these measurements with Doppler tomography, where we spectroscopically\nresolve the line profile perturbation during the transit due to the\nRossiter-McLaughlin effect. We analyze time series spectra obtained during\nportions of five transits of HAT-P-41 b, and find a value of the spin-orbit\nmisalignment of $\\lambda = -22.1_{-6.0}^{+0.8 \\circ}$. We reanalyze the radial\nvelocity Rossiter-McLaughlin data on WASP-79 b obtained by Addison et al.\n(2013) using Doppler tomographic methodology. We measure\n$\\lambda=-99.1_{-3.9}^{+4.1\\circ}$, consistent with but more precise than the\nvalue found by Addison et al. (2013). For Kepler-448 b we perform a joint fit\nto the Kepler light curve, Doppler tomographic data, and a radial velocity\ndataset from Lillo-Box et al. (2015). We find an approximately aligned orbit\n($\\lambda=-7.1^{+4.2 \\circ}_{-2.8}$), in modest disagreement with the value\nfound by Bourrier et al. (2015). Through analysis of the Kepler light curve we\nmeasure a stellar rotation period of $P_{\\mathrm{rot}}=1.27 \\pm 0.11$ days, and\nuse this to argue that the full three-dimensional spin-orbit misalignment is\nsmall, $\\psi\\sim0^{\\circ}$.\n", "  In this publication we continue the work started in Quintero Noda et al.\n(2017) examining this time a numerical simulation of a magnetic flux tube\nconcentration. Our goal is to study if the physical phenomena that take place\nin it, in particular, the magnetic pumping, leaves a specific imprint on the\nexamined spectral lines. We find that the profiles from the interior of the\nflux tube are periodically dopplershifted following an oscillation pattern that\nis also reflected in the amplitude of the circular polarization signals. In\naddition, we analyse the properties of the Stokes profiles at the edges of the\nflux tube discovering the presence of linear polarization signals for the Ca II\nlines, although they are weak with an amplitude around 0.5% of the continuum\nintensity. Finally, we compute the response functions to perturbations in the\nlongitudinal field and we estimate the field strength using the weak field\napproximation. Our results indicate that the height of formation of the\nspectral lines changes during the magnetic pumping process which makes the\ninterpretation of the inferred magnetic field strength and its evolution more\ndifficult. These results complement those from previous works demonstrating the\ncapabilities and limitations of the 850 nm spectrum for chromospheric Zeeman\npolarimetry in a very dynamic and complex atmosphere.\n", "  We present arc-second-resolution data in the radio, IR, optical and X-ray for\n4C+19.44 (=PKS 1354+195), the longest and straightest quasar jet with deep\nX-ray observations. We report results from radio images with half to one\narc-second angular resolution at three frequencies, plus HST and Spitzer data.\nThe Chandra data allow us to measure the X-ray spectral index in 10 distinct\nregions along the 18 arcsec jet and compare with the radio index. The radio and\nX-ray spectral indices of the jet regions are consistent with a value of\n$\\alpha =0.80$ throughout the jet, to within 2 sigma uncertainties. The X-ray\njet structure to the south extends beyond the prominent radio jet and connects\nto the southern radio lobe, and there is extended X-ray emission in the\ndirection of the unseen counter jet and coincident with the northern radio\nlobe. This jet is remarkable since its straight appearance over a large\ndistance allows the geometry factors to be taken as fixed along the jet. Using\nthe model of inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background\n(iC/CMB) by relativistic electrons, we find that the magnetic field strengths\nand Doppler factors are relatively constant along the jet. If instead the\nX-rays are synchrotron emission, they must arise from a population of electrons\ndistinct from the particles producing the radio synchrotron spectrum.\n", "  We present H$\\alpha$ spectroscopic observations and detailed modelling of the\nBalmer filaments in the supernova remnant Tycho. We used Galaxy H$\\alpha$\nFabry-P\\'erot Spectrometer on the William Herschel Telescope with a\n3.4'$\\times$3.4' field-of-view, 0.2\" pixel scale and $\\sigma_\\rm{instr}=8.1$\nkm/s resolution at 1\" seeing for $\\sim10$ hours, resulting in 82\nspatial-spectral bins that resolve the narrow H$\\alpha$ line in the entire\nTycho's northeastern rim. For the first time, we can mitigate artificial line\nbroadening from unresolved differential motion, and probe H$\\alpha$ emission\nparameters in varying shock and ambient medium conditions. Broad H$\\alpha$ line\nremains unresolved within spectral coverage of 392 km/s. We employed Bayesian\ninference to obtain reliable parameter confidence intervals, and quantify the\nevidence for models with multiple line components. The median H$\\alpha$\nnarrow-line full-width at half-maximum of all bins and models is\n$W_\\rm{NL}=(54.8\\pm1.8)$ km/s at the $95\\%$ confidence level, varying within\n[35, 72] km/s between bins and clearly broadened compared to the intrinsic\n(thermal) $\\approx20$ km/s. Possible line splits are accounted for, significant\nin $\\approx18\\%$ of the filament, and presumably due to remaining projection\neffects. We also find wide-spread evidence for intermediate-line emission of a\nbroad-neutral precursor, with median $W_\\rm{IL}=(180\\pm14)$ km/s ($95\\%$\nconfidence). Finally, we present a measurement of the remnant's systemic\nvelocity, $V_\\rm{LSR}=-34$ km/s, and map differential line-of-sight motions.\nOur results confirm the existence and interplay of shock precursors in Tycho's\nremnant. In particular, we show that suprathermal narrow-line emission is\nnear-universal in Tycho and that, in absence of an alternative explanation,\ncollisionless supernova remnant shocks constitute a viable acceleration source\nfor Galactic TeV Cosmic-Ray protons.\n", "  CONTEXT: High-precision stellar analyses require hydrodynamic modeling to\ninterpret chemical abundances or oscillation modes. Exoplanet atmosphere\nstudies require stellar background spectra to be known along the transit path\nwhile detection of Earth analogs require stellar microvariability to be\nunderstood. Hydrodynamic 3-D models can be computed for widely different stars\nbut have been tested in detail only for the Sun with its resolved surface\nfeatures. Model predictions include spectral line shapes, asymmetries, and\nwavelength shifts, and their center-to-limb changes across stellar disks. AIMS:\nTo observe high-resolution spectral line profiles across spatially highly\nresolved stellar surfaces, which are free from the effects of spatial smearing\nand rotational broadening present in full-disk spectra, enabling comparisons to\nsynthetic profiles from 3-D models. METHODS: During exoplanet transits,\nsuccessive stellar surface portions become hidden and differential spectroscopy\nbetween various transit phases provides spectra of small surface segments\ntemporarily hidden behind the planet. Planets cover no more than about 1% of\nany main-sequence star, enabling high spatial resolution but demanding very\nprecise observations. Realistically measurable quantities are identified\nthrough simulated observations of synthetic spectral lines. RESULTS: In normal\nstars, line profile ratios between various transit phases may vary by some\n0.5%, requiring S/N ratios of 5,000 or more for meaningful spectral\nreconstruction. While not yet realistic for individual spectral lines, this is\nachievable for cool stars by averaging over numerous lines with similar\nparameters. CONCLUSIONS: For bright host stars of large transiting planets,\nspatially resolved spectroscopy is currently practical. More observable targets\nare likely to be found in the near future by ongoing photometric searches.\n", "  CONTEXT: High-resolution spectroscopy across spatially resolved stellar\nsurfaces aims at obtaining spectral-line profiles that are free from rotational\nbroadening; the gradual changes of these profiles from disk center toward the\nstellar limb reveal properties of atmospheric fine structure, which are\npossible to model with 3-D hydrodynamics. AIMS: Previous such studies have only\nbeen carried out for the Sun but are now extended to other stars. In this work,\nprofiles of photospheric spectral lines are retrieved across the disk of the\nplanet-hosting star HD209458 (G0V). METHODS: During exoplanet transit, stellar\nsurface portions successively become hidden and differential spectroscopy\nprovides spectra of small surface segments temporarily hidden behind the\nplanet. The method was elaborated in Paper I, with observable signatures\nquantitatively predicted from hydrodynamic simulations. RESULTS: From\nobservations of HD209458 with spectral resolution R=80,000, photospheric FeI\nline profiles are obtained at several center-to-limb positions, reaching\nadequately high S/N after averaging over numerous similar lines CONCLUSIONS:\nRetrieved line profiles are compared to synthetic line profiles. Hydrodynamic\n3-D models predict, and current observations confirm, that photospheric\nabsorption lines become broader and shallower toward the stellar limb,\nreflecting that horizontal velocities in stellar granulation are greater than\nvertical velocities. Additional types of 3-D signatures will become observable\nwith the highest resolution spectrometers at large telescopes.\n", "  We analyse the morphology and kinematics of dense filamentary structures\nproduced in a numerical simulation of a star--forming cloud of $1.4 \\times 10^4\n\\, \\Msun$ evolving under their own self--gravity in a magnetized medium. This\nstudy is motivated by recent observations of velocity--coherent substructures\n(\"fibres\") in star-forming filaments. We find such \"fibres\" ubiquitously in our\nsimulated filament. We found that a fibre in one projection is not necessarily\na fibre in another projection, and thus, caution should be taken into account\nwhen considering them as real objects. We found that only the densest parts of\nthe filament ($\\sim$30\\% of the densest volume, which contains $\\sim$70\\% of\nthe mass) belong to fibres in 2 projections. Moreover, it is quite common that\nthey are formed by separated density enhancements superposed along the line of\nsight. Observations of fibres can yield insight into the level of turbulent\nsubstructure driven by gravity, but care should be taken in interpreting the\nresults given the problem of line of sight superposition. We also studied the\nmorphology and kinematics of the 3D skeleton (spine), finding that subfilaments\naccrete structured material mainly along the magnetic field lines, which are\npreferentially perpendicular to the skeleton. The magnetic field is at the same\ntime dragged by the velocity field due to the gravitational collapse.\n", "  Radio relics at the peripheries of galaxy clusters are tracers of the elusive\ncluster merger shocks. We report the discovery of a single radio relic in the\ngalaxy cluster PLCK G200.9-28.2 ($z=0.22$, $M_{500} = 2.7\\pm0.2 \\times 10^{14}\nM_{\\odot}$) using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 235 and 610 MHz and\nthe Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 1500 MHz. The relic has a size of $\\sim\n1 \\times 0.28$ Mpc, an arc-like morphology and is located at 0.9 Mpc from the\nX-ray brightness peak in the cluster. The integrated spectral index of the\nrelic is $1.21\\pm0.15$. The spectral index map between 235 and 610 MHz shows\nsteepening from the outer to the inner edge of the relic in line with the\nexpectation from a cluster merger shock. Under the assumption of diffusive\nshock acceleration, the radio spectral index implies a Mach number of\n$3.3\\pm1.8$ for the shock. The analysis of archival XMM Newton data shows that\nPLCK G200.9-28.2 consists of a northern brighter sub-cluster, and a southern\nsub-cluster in a state of merger. This cluster has the lowest mass among the\nclusters hosting single radio relics. The position of the Planck Sunyaev\nZe'ldovich effect in this cluster is offset by 700 kpc from the X-ray peak in\nthe direction of the radio relic, suggests a physical origin for the offset.\nSuch large offsets in low mass clusters can be a useful tool to select\ndisturbed clusters and to study the state of merger.\n", "  Binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos is the target of the proposed NASA\nDouble Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), part of the Asteroid Impact &\nDeflection Assessment (AIDA) mission concept. In this mission, the DART\nspacecraft is planned to impact the secondary body of Didymos, perturbing\nmutual dynamics of the system. The primary body is currently rotating at a spin\nperiod close to the spin barrier of asteroids, and materials ejected from the\nsecondary due to the DART impact are likely to reach the primary. These\nconditions may cause the primary to reshape, due to landslides, or internal\ndeformation, changing the permanent gravity field. Here, we propose that if\nshape deformation of the primary occurs, the mutual orbit of the system would\nbe perturbed due to a change in the gravity field. We use a numerical\nsimulation technique based on the full two-body problem to investigate the\nshape effect on the mutual dynamics in Didymos after the DART impact. The\nresults show that under constant volume, shape deformation induces strong\nperturbation in the mutual motion. We find that the deformation process always\ncauses the orbital period of the system to become shorter. If surface layers\nwith a thickness greater than ~0.4 m on the poles of the primary move down to\nthe equatorial region due to the DART impact, a change in the orbital period of\nthe system and in the spin period of the primary will be detected by\nground-based measurement.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of the galaxy Star Formation Rate Function\n(SFRF) and Cosmic Star Formation Rate Density (CSFRD) of $z\\sim 0-8 $ galaxies\nin the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE)\nsimulations. In addition, we present a compilation of UV, IR and H$\\alpha$\nSFRFs and compare these with the predictions from the EAGLE suite of\ncosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the constraints implied by\ndifferent indicators are inconsistent with each other for the highest\nstar-forming objects at z < 2, a problem that is possibly related to selection\nbiases and the uncertainties of dust attenuation effects. EAGLE's feedback\nparameters were calibrated to reproduce realistic galaxy sizes and stellar\nmasses at z = 0.1. In this work we test if and why those choices yield\nrealistic Star Formation Rates (SFRs) for $z \\sim 0-8$ as well. We demonstrate\nthat SNe feedback plays a major role at setting the abundance of galaxies at\nall star-forming regimes, especially at high redshifts. On the contrary, Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback becomes more prominent at lower redshifts and is\na major mechanism that affects only the highest star-forming systems.\nFurthermore, we find that galaxies with SFR $\\sim 1-10 \\, {\\rm M_{\\odot} \\,\nyr^{-1}}$ dominate the CSFRD at redshifts z < 5, while rare high star-forming\ngalaxies (SFR $\\sim 10-100 \\,{\\rm M_{\\odot} \\, yr^{-1}}$) contribute\nsignificantly only briefly around the peak era ($z \\sim 2$) and then are\nquenched by AGN feedback. In the absence of this prescription objects with SFR\n$\\sim 10-100 \\,{\\rm M_{\\odot} \\, yr^{-1}}$ would dominate the CSFRD, while the\ncosmic budget of star formation would be extremely high. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that the majority of the cosmic star formation occurs in relatively\nrare high mass halos ($ {\\rm M_{Halo}} \\sim 10^{11-13} \\, {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$)\neven at the earliest epochs.\n", "  In Dai et al. (2016) we developed a formalism for computing variance images\nfrom standard, interferometric radio images containing time and frequency\ninformation. Variance imaging with future radio continuum surveys allows us to\nidentify radio pulsars and serves as a complement to conventional pulsar\nsearches which are most sensitive to strictly periodic signals. Here, we carry\nout simulations to predict the number of pulsars that we can uncover with\nvariance imaging on future continuum surveys. We show that the Australian SKA\nPathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey can find\n$\\sim30$ normal pulsars and $\\sim40$ millisecond pulsars (MSPs) over and above\nthe number known today, and similarly an all-sky continuum survey with SKA-MID\ncan discover $\\sim140$ normal pulsars and $\\sim110$ MSPs with this technique.\nVariance imaging with EMU and SKA-MID will detect pulsars with large duty\ncycles and is therefore a potential tool for finding MSPs and pulsars in\nrelativistic binary systems. Compared with current pulsar surveys at high\nGalactic latitudes in the southern hemisphere, variance imaging with EMU and\nSKA-MID will be more sensitive, and will enable detection of pulsars with\ndispersion measures between $\\sim10$ and 100 cm$^{-3}$ pc.\n", "  An instrumentation problem with the signal acquisition at high frequencies\nwas discovered and we no longer believe that the experimental data presented in\nthe manuscript, showing a frequency enhancement of the elastoresistivity, are\ncorrect. After correcting the problem, the elastoresistivity data is frequency\nindependent in the range investigated. Therefore, the authors have withdrawn\nthis submission.\n  We would like to thank Alex Hristov, Johanna Palmstrom, Josh Straquadine and\nIan Fisher (Stanford) for the kind discussions and assistance we received which\nhelped us identify these problems.\n", "  Chondritic meteorites primarily contain millimeter-sized spherical objects,\nthe so-called chondrules; however, the co-accretion process of chondrules and\nmatrix grains is not yet understood. In this study, we investigate the ejection\nprocess of chondrules via collisions of fluffy aggregates composed of\nchondrules and matrices. We reveal that fluffy aggregates cannot grow into\nplanetesimals without losing chondrules if we assume that the chondrite parent\nbodies are formed via direct aggregation of similar-sized aggregates.\nTherefore, an examination of other growth pathways is necessary to explain the\nformation of rocky planetesimals in our solar system.\n", "  Large exoplanet surveys have successfully detected thousands of exoplanets\nto-date. Utilizing these detections and non-detections to constrain our\nunderstanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems also requires\na detailed understanding of the basic properties of their host stars. We have\ndetermined the basic stellar properties of F, K, and G stars in the Strategic\nExploration of Exoplanets and Disks with Subaru (SEEDS) survey from echelle\nspectra taken at the Apache Point Observatory's 3.5m telescope. Using ROBOSPECT\nto extract line equivalent widths and TGVIT to calculate the fundamental\nparameters, we have computed Teff, log(g), vt, [Fe/H], chromospheric activity,\nand the age for our sample. Our methodology was calibrated against previously\npublished results for a portion of our sample. The distribution of [Fe/H] in\nour sample is consistent with that typical of the Solar neighborhood.\nAdditionally, we find the ages of most of our sample are $< 500 Myrs$, but note\nthat we cannot determine robust ages from significantly older stars via\nchromospheric activity age indicators. The future meta-analysis of the\nfrequency of wide stellar and sub-stellar companions imaged via the SEEDS\nsurvey will utilize our results to constrain the occurrence of detected\nco-moving companions with the properties of their host stars.\n", "  We have used the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to observe the\n36.2-GHz class I methanol maser emission towards NGC253 and find that it is\nlocated at the interface between the nuclear ring and both ends of the galactic\nbar. This is thought to be the location of the inner Linblad resonance and we\nsuggest that the maser emission in this region is likely due to large-scale\ncloud-cloud collisions. We have detected the first extragalactic 44.1-GHz class\nI methanol maser and find that it is associated with the 36.2-GHz maser\nemission. In contrast to the class I methanol masers found in Galactic star\nformation regions, the 44.1-GHz emission in NGC253 is two orders of magnitude\nweaker than the 36.2-GHz masers. Both the 36.2- and 44.1- GHz emission is\norders of magnitude stronger than expected from typical high-mass star\nformation regions. This demonstrates that the luminous class I methanol masers\nobserved in NGC253 are significantly different from those associated with\nGalactic star formation.\n", "  Aims. Our goal is to characterize the intermediate age, detached shell carbon\nstar U Antliae morphologically and physically in order to study the mass-loss\nevolution after a possible thermal pulse. Methods. High spatial resolution ALMA\nobservations of unprecedented quality in thermal CO lines allow us to derive\nfirst critical spatial and temporal scales and constrain modeling efforts to\nestimate mass-loss rates for both the present day as well as the ejection\nperiod of the detached shell. Results. The detached shell is remarkably thin,\noverall spherically symmetric, and shows a barely resolved filamentary\nsubstructure possibly caused by instabilities in the interaction zone of winds\nwith different outflow velocities. The expansion age of the detached shell is\nof the order of 2700 years and its overall width indicates a high\nexpansion-velocity and high mass-loss period of only a few hundred years at an\naverage mass-loss rate of $\\approx$ 10$^{-5}$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The\npost-high-mass-loss-rate-epoch evolution of U Ant shows a significant decline\nto a substantially lower gas expansion velocity and a mass-loss rate amounting\nto 4$\\times$10$^{-8}$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, at present being consistent with\nevolutionary changes as predicted for the period between thermal pulses.\n", "  We present a survey of X-ray point sources in the nearest and dynamically\nyoung galaxy cluster, Virgo, using archival Chandra observations that sample\nthe vicinity of 80 early-type member galaxies. The X-ray source populations at\nthe outskirt of these galaxies are of particular interest. We detect a total of\n1046 point sources (excluding galactic nuclei) out to a projected\ngalactocentric radius of $\\sim$40 kpc and down to a limiting 0.5-8 keV\nluminosity of $\\sim$$2\\times10^{38}{\\rm~erg~s^{-1}}$. Based on the cumulative\nspatial and flux distributions of these sources, we statistically identify\n$\\sim$120 excess sources that are not associated with the main stellar content\nof the individual galaxies, nor with the cosmic X-ray background. This excess\nis significant at a 3.5 $\\sigma$ level, when Poisson error and cosmic variance\nare taken into account. On the other hand, no significant excess sources are\nfound at the outskirt of a control sample of field galaxies, suggesting that at\nleast some fraction of the excess sources around the Virgo galaxies are truly\nintra-cluster X-ray sources. Assisted with ground-based and HST optical imaging\nof Virgo, we discuss the origins of these intra-cluster X-ray sources, in terms\nof supernova-kicked low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), globular clusters, LMXBs\nassociated with the diffuse intra-cluster light, stripped nucleated dwarf\ngalaxies and free-floating massive black holes.\n", "  The rest-frame UV spectra of three recent tidal disruption events (TDEs),\nASASSN-14li, PTF15af and iPTF16fnl display strong nitrogen emission lines but\nweak or undetectable carbon lines. In these three objects, the upper limits of\nthe C III] $\\lambda 1908$/N III] $\\lambda 1750$ ratio are about two orders of\nmagnitude lower than those of quasars, suggesting a high abundance ratio of\n[N/C]. With detailed photoionization simulations, we demonstrate that $C^{2+}$\nand $N^{2+}$ are formed in the same zone, so the C III]/N III] ratio depends\nonly moderately on the physical conditions in the gas and weakly on the shape\nof the ionizing continuum. There are smaller than $0.5$ dex variations in the\nline ratio over wide ranges of gas densities and ionization parameters at a\ngiven metallicity. This allows a robust estimate of the relative abundance\nratio nitrogen to carbon. We derive a relative abundance ratio of [N/C]$>1.5$\nfor ASASSN-14li, and even higher for PTF15af and iPTF16fnl. This suggests that\nthe broad line region in those TDE sources is made of nitrogen-enhanced core\nmaterial that falls back at later times. Based on stellar evolution models, the\nlower limit of the disrupted star should be larger than 0.6M$_{\\odot}$. The\nchemical abundance of the line emitting gas gives a convincing evidence that\nthe flares origin from stellar tidal disruptions. The coincidence of the\nweakness of the X-ray emission with the strong broad absorption lines in\nPTF15af, iPTF16fnl and the strong X-ray emission without such lines in\nASASSN-li14 are in analogy to quasars with and without broad absorption lines.\n", "  A large fraction of stars in binary systems are expected to undergo mass and\nangular momentum exchange at some point in their evolution, which can\ndrastically alter the chemical and dynamical properties and fates of the\nsystems. Interaction by stellar wind is an important process in wide binaries.\nHowever, the details of wind mass transfer are still not well understood. We\nperform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of wind mass transfer in\nbinary systems to explore mass accretion efficiencies and geometries of mass\noutflows, for a range of mass ratios from 0.05 to 1.0. In particular, we focus\non the case of a free wind, in which some physical mechanism accelerates the\nexpelled wind material balancing the gravity of the mass-losing star with the\nwind velocity comparable to the orbital velocity of the system. We find that\nthe mass accretion efficiency and accreted specific angular momentum increase\nwith the mass ratio of the system. For an adiabatic wind, we obtain that the\naccretion efficiency onto the secondary star varies from about 0.1% to 8% for\nmass ratios between 0.05 and 1.0.\n", "  Recently, a precise (sub-arcsecond) localization of the repeating fast radio\nburst (FRB) 121102 has led to the discovery of persistent radio and optical\ncounterparts, the identification of a host dwarf galaxy at a redshift of\n$z=0.193$, and several campaigns of searches for higher-frequency counterparts,\nwhich gave only upper limits on the emission flux. Although the origin of FRBs\nremains unknown, most of the existing theoretical models are associated with\npulsars, or more specifically, magnetars. In this paper, we explore persistent\nhigh-energy emission from a rapidly rotating highly magnetized pulsar\nassociated with FRB 121102 if internal gradual magnetic dissipation occurs in\nthe pulsar wind. We find that the efficiency of converting the spin-down\nluminosity to the high-energy (e.g., X-ray) luminosity is generally much\nsmaller than unity, even for a millisecond magnetar. This provides an\nexplanation for the non-detection of high-energy counterparts to FRB 121102. We\nfurther constrain the spin period and surface magnetic field strength of the\npulsar with the current high-energy observations. In addition, we compare our\nresults with the constraints given by the other methods in previous works and\nwould expect to apply our new method to some other open issues in the future.\n", "  We examine the level of substructure and mass segregation in the massive,\nyoung cluster Westerlund 1. We find that it is relatively smooth, with little\nor no mass segregation, but with the massive stars in regions of significantly\nhigher than average surface density. While an expanding or bouncing-back\nscenario for the evolution of Westerlund 1 cannot be ruled out, we argue that\nthe most natural model to explain these observations is one in which Westerlund\n1 formed with no primordial mass segregation and at a similar or larger size\nthan we now observe.\n", "  A recent study by Posselt et al. (2017) reported the deepest X-ray\ninvestigation of the Geminga pulsar wind nebula (PWN) by using \\emph{Chandra\nX-ray Observatory}. In comparison with previous studies of this system, a\nnumber of new findings have been reported and we found these suggest the\npossible variabilities in various components of this PWN. This motivates us to\ncarry out a dedicated search for the morphological and spectral variations of\nthis complex nebula. We have discovered variabilities on timescales from a few\ndays to a few months from different components of the nebula. The fastest\nchange occurred in the circumstellar environment at a rate of 80 per cent of\nthe speed of light. One of the most spectacular results is the wiggling of a\nhalf light-year long tail as an extension of the jet, which is significantly\nbent by the ram pressure. The jet wiggling occurred at a rate of about 20 per\ncent of the speed of light. This twisted structure can possibly be a result of\na propagating torsional Alf\\`{v}en wave. We have also found evidence of\nspectral hardening along this tail for a period of about nine months.\n", "  We present an investigation of long-term modulation in the X-ray light curves\nof five little-studied candidate high-mass X-ray binaries using the Swift Burst\nAlert Telescope. IGR J14488-5942 and AX J1700.2-4220 show strong modulation at\nperiods of 49.6 and 44 days, respectively, which are interpreted as orbital\nperiods of Be star systems. For IGR J14488-5942, observations with Swift X-ray\nTelescope show a hint of pulsations at 33.4 s. For AX J1700.2-4220, 54 s\npulsations were previously found with XMM. Swift J1816.7-1613 exhibits\ncomplicated behavior. The strongest peak in the power spectrum is at a period\nnear 150 days, but this conflicts with a determination of a period of 118.5\ndays by La Parola et al. (2014). AX J1820.5-1434 has been proposed to exhibit\nmodulation near 54 days, but the extended BAT observations suggest modulation\nat slightly longer than double this at approximately 111 days. There appears to\nbe a long-term change in the shape of the modulation near 111 days, which may\nexplain the apparent discrepancy. The X-ray pulsar XTE J1906+090, which was\npreviously proposed to be a Be star system with an orbital period of ~30 days\nfrom pulse timing, shows peaks in the power spectrum at 81 and 173 days. The\norigins of these periods are unclear, although they might be the orbital period\nand a superorbital period respectively. For all five sources, the long-term\nvariability, together with the combination of orbital and proposed pulse\nperiods, suggests that the sources contain Be star mass donors.\n", "  We present new measurements of the dependence of the Extreme Ultraviolet\nradiance on the total magnetic flux in active regions as obtained from the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on\nboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Using observations of nine active\nregions tracked along different stages of evolution, we extend the known\nradiance - magnetic flux power-law relationship ($I\\propto\\Phi^{\\alpha}$) to\nthe AIA 335 \\AA\\ passband, and the Fe XVIII 93.93 \\AA\\ spectral line in the 94\n\\AA\\ passband. We find that the total unsigned magnetic flux divided by the\npolarity separation ($\\Phi/D$) is a better indicator of radiance for the Fe\nXVIII line with a slope of $\\alpha=3.22\\pm0.03$. We then use these results to\ntest our current understanding of magnetic flux evolution and coronal heating.\nWe use magnetograms from the simulated decay of these active regions produced\nby the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model as boundary conditions for\npotential extrapolations of the magnetic field in the corona. We then model the\nhydrodynamics of each individual field line with the Enthalpy-based Thermal\nEvolution of Loops (EBTEL) model with steady heating scaled as the ratio of the\naverage field strength and the length ($\\bar{B}/L$) and render the Fe XVIII and\n335 \\AA\\ emission. We find that steady heating is able to partially reproduce\nthe magnitudes and slopes of the EUV radiance - magnetic flux relationships and\ndiscuss how impulsive heating can help reconcile the discrepancies. This study\ndemonstrates that combined models of magnetic flux transport, magnetic topology\nand heating can yield realistic estimates for the decay of active region\nradiances with time.\n", "  Starting from first principles, we show the formation and evolution of\nsuperconducting gaps in MgB$_2$ at its ultrathin limit. Atomically thin MgB$_2$\nis distinctly different from bulk MgB$_2$ in that surface states become\ncomparable in electronic density to the bulk-like $\\sigma$- and $\\pi$-bands.\nCombining the ab initio electron-phonon coupling with the anisotropic\nEliashberg equations, we show that monolayer MgB$_2$ develops three distinct\nsuperconducting gaps, on completely separate parts of the Fermi surface due to\nthe emergent surface contribution. These gaps hybridize nontrivially with every\nextra monolayer added to the film, owing to the opening of additional coupling\nchannels. Furthermore, we reveal that the three-gap superconductivity in\nmonolayer MgB$_2$ is robust over the entire temperature range that stretches up\nto a considerably high critical temperature of 20 K. The latter can be boosted\nto $>$50 K under biaxial tensile strain of $\\sim$ 4\\%, which is an enhancement\nstronger than in any other graphene-related superconductor known to date.\n", "  We present new evidence for a variable stellar initial mass function (IMF) in\nmassive early-type galaxies, using high-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy\nfrom the Folded-port InfraRed Echellette spectrograph (FIRE) on the Magellan\nBaade Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. In this pilot study, we observe\nseveral gravity-sensitive metal lines between 1.1 $\\mu$m and 1.3 $\\mu$m in\neight highly-luminous ($L \\sim 10 L_*$) nearby galaxies. Thanks to the broad\nwavelength coverage of FIRE, we are also able to observe the Ca II triplet\nfeature, which helps with our analysis. After measuring the equivalent widths\n(EWs) of these lines, we notice mild to moderate trends between EW and central\nvelocity dispersion ($\\sigma$), with some species (K I, Na I, Mn I) showing a\npositive EW-$\\sigma$ correlation and others (Mg I, Ca II, Fe I) a negative one.\nTo minimize the effects of metallicity, we measure the ratio $R$ = [EW(K I) /\nEW(Mg I)], finding a significant systematic increase in this ratio with respect\nto $\\sigma$. We then probe for variations in the IMF by comparing the measured\nline ratios to the values expected in several IMF models. Overall, we find that\nlow-mass galaxies ($\\sigma \\sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$) favor a Chabrier IMF, while\nhigh-mass galaxies ($\\sigma \\sim 350$ km s$^{-1}$) are better described with a\nsteeper (dwarf-rich) IMF slope. While we note that our galaxy sample is small\nand may suffer from selection effects, these initial results are still\npromising. A larger sample of galaxies will therefore provide an even clearer\npicture of IMF trends in this regime.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the Na I line strength index centered in the\n$K$-band at $22100$, {\\AA} (NaI2.21 hereafter) relying on different samples of\nearly-type galaxies. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the\nobserved line strength indices cannot be fit by state-of-art scaled-solar\nstellar population models, even using our newly developed models in the NIR.\nThe models clearly underestimate the large NaI2.21 values measured for most\nearly-type galaxies. However, we develop a Na-enhanced version of our newly\ndeveloped models in the NIR, which - together with the effect of a bottom-heavy\ninitial mass function - yield NaI2.21 indices in the range of the observations.\nTherefore, we suggest a scenario in which the combined effect of [Na/Fe]\nenhancement and a bottom-heavy initial mass function are mainly responsible for\nthe large NaI2.21 indices observed for most early-type galaxies. To a smaller\nextent, also [C/Fe] enhancement might contribute to the large observed NaI2.21\nvalues.\n", "  We obtained 16 VLT/X-shooter observations of GX 339-4 in quiescence in the\nperiod May - September 2016 and detected absorption lines from the donor star\nin its NIR spectrum. This allows us to measure the radial velocity curve and\nprojected rotational velocity of the donor for the first time. We confirm the\n1.76 day orbital period and we find that $K_2$ = $219 \\pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$,\n$\\gamma = 26 \\pm 2$ km s$^{-1}$ and $v \\sin i = 64 \\pm 8$ km s$^{-1}$. From\nthese values we compute a mass function $f(M) =1.91 \\pm 0.08~M_{\\odot}$, a\nfactor $\\sim 3$ lower than previously reported, and a mass ratio $q = 0.18 \\pm\n0.05$. We confirm the donor is a K-type star and estimate that it contributes\n$\\sim 45-50\\%$ of the light in the $J$- and H-band. We constrain the binary\ninclination to $37^\\circ < i < 78^\\circ$ and the black hole mass to\n$2.3~M_{\\odot} < M_\\mathrm{BH} < 9.5~M_{\\odot}$. GX 339-4 may therefore be the\nfirst black hole to fall in the 'mass-gap' of $2-5~M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  The computation of light scattering by the superposition T-matrix scheme has\nbeen so far restricted to systems made of particles that are either sparsely\ndistributed or of near-spherical shape. In this work, we extend the range of\napplicability of the T-matrix method by accounting for the coupling of\nscattered fields between highly non-spherical particles in close vicinity. This\nis achieved using an alternative formulation of the translation operator for\nspherical vector wave functions, based on a plane wave expansion of the\nparticle's scattered electromagnetic field. The accuracy and versatility of the\npresent approach is demonstrated by simulating arbitrarily oriented and densely\npacked spheroids, for both, dielectric and metallic particles.\n", "  High spatial and temporal resolution images of a sunspot, obtained\nsimultaneously in multiple optical and UV wavelengths, are employed to study\nthe propagation and damping characteristics of slow magnetoacoustic waves up to\ntransition region heights. Power spectra are generated from intensity\noscillations in sunspot umbra, across multiple atmospheric heights, for\nfrequencies up to a few hundred mHz. It is observed that the power spectra\ndisplay a power-law dependence over the entire frequency range, with a\nsignificant enhancement around 5.5 mHz found for the chromospheric channels.\nThe phase-difference spectra reveal a cutoff frequency near 3 mHz, up to which\nthe oscillations are evanescent, while those with higher frequencies propagate\nupwards. The power-law index appears to increase with atmospheric height. Also,\nshorter damping lengths are observed for oscillations with higher frequencies\nsuggesting frequency-dependent damping. Using the relative amplitudes of the\n5.5 mHz (3 minute) oscillations, we estimate the energy flux at different\nheights, which seems to decay gradually from the photosphere, in agreement with\nrecent numerical simulations. Furthermore, a comparison of power spectra across\nthe umbral radius highlights an enhancement of high-frequency waves near the\numbral center, which does not seem to be related to magnetic field inclination\nangle effects.\n", "  Aims. A large number of Calcium Infrared Triplet (IRT) spectra are expected\nfrom the GAIA- and CARMENES missions. Conversion of these spectra into known\nactivity indicators will allow analysis of their temporal evolution to a better\ndegree. We set out to find such a conversion formula and to determine its\nrobustness.\n  Methods. We have compared 2274 Ca II IRT spectra of active main-sequence F to\nK stars taken by the TIGRE telescope with those of inactive stars of the same\nspectral type. After normalizing and applying rotational broadening, we\nsubtracted the comparison spectra to find the chromospheric excess flux caused\nby activity. We obtained the total excess flux, and compared it to established\nactivity indices derived from the Ca II H & K lines, the spectra of which were\nobtained simultaneously to the infrared spectra.\n  Results. The excess flux in the Ca II IRT is found to correlate well with\n$R_\\mathrm{HK}'$ and $R_\\mathrm{HK}^{+}$, as well as $S_\\mathrm{MWO}$, if the\n$B-V$-dependency is taken into account. We find an empirical conversion formula\nto calculate the corresponding value of one activity indicator from the\nmeasurement of another, by comparing groups of datapoints of stars with similar\nB-V.\n", "  Divisibility of dynamical maps is visualized by trajectories in the parameter\nspace and analyzed within the framework of collision models. We introduce\nultimate completely positive (CP) divisible processes, which lose CP\ndivisibility under infinitesimal perturbations, and characterize Pauli\ndynamical semigroups exhibiting such a property. We construct collision models\nwith factorized environment particles, which realize additivity and\nmultiplicativity of generators of CP divisible maps. A mixture of dynamical\nmaps is obtained with the help of correlated environment. Mixture of ultimate\nCP divisible processes is shown to result in a new class of eternal CP\nindivisible evolutions. We explicitly find collision models leading to weakly\nand essentially non-Markovian Pauli dynamical maps.\n", "  We report spectroscopic and differential photometric observations of the\nA-type system V482 Per that reveal it to be a rare hierarchical quadruple\nsystem containing two eclipsing binaries. One has the previously known orbital\nperiod of 2.4 days and a circular orbit, and the other a period of 6 days, a\nslightly eccentric orbit (e = 0.11), and shallow eclipses only 2.3% deep. The\ntwo binaries revolve around their common center of mass in a highly elongated\norbit (e = 0.85) with a period of 16.67 yr. Radial velocities are measured for\nall components from our quadruple-lined spectra, and are combined with the\nlight curves and with measurements of times of minimum light for the 2.4 day\nbinary to solve for the elements of the inner and outer orbits simultaneously.\nThe line-of-sight inclination angles of the three orbits are similar,\nsuggesting they may be close to coplanar. The available observations appear to\nindicate that the 6 day binary experiences significant retrograde apsidal\nmotion in the amount of about 60 degrees per century. We derive absolute masses\nfor the four stars good to better than 1.5%, along with radii with formal\nerrors of 1.1% and 3.5% for the 2.4 day binary and about 9% for the 6 day\nbinary. A comparison of these and other physical properties with current\nstellar evolution models gives excellent agreement for a metallicity of [Fe/H]\n= -0.15 and an age of 360 Myr.\n", "  Context: The gravitational lensing time delay method provides a one-step\ndetermination of the Hubble constant (H0) with an uncertainty level on par with\nthe cosmic distance ladder method. However, to further investigate the nature\nof the dark energy, a H0 estimate down to 1% level is greatly needed. This\nrequires dozens of strongly lensed quasars that are yet to be delivered by\nongoing and forthcoming all-sky surveys.\n  Aims: In this work we aim to determine the spectroscopic redshift of\nPSOJ0147, the first strongly lensed quasar candidate found in the Pan-STARRS\nsurvey. The main goal of our work is to derive an accurate redshift estimate of\nthe background quasar for cosmography.\n  Methods: To obtain timely spectroscopically follow-up, we took advantage of\nthe fast-track service programme that is carried out by the Nordic Optical\nTelescope. Using a grism covering 3200 - 9600 A, we identified prominent\nemission line features, such as Ly-alpha, N V, O I, C II, Si IV, C IV, and [C\nIII] in the spectra of the background quasar of the PSOJ0147 lens system. This\nenables us to determine accurately the redshift of the background quasar.\n  Results: The spectrum of the background quasar exhibits prominent absorption\nfeatures bluewards of the strong emission lines, such as Ly-alpha, N V, and C\nIV. These blue absorption lines indicate that the background source is a broad\nabsorption line (BAL) quasar. Unfortunately, the BAL features hamper an\naccurate determination of redshift using the above-mentioned strong emission\nlines. Nevertheless, we are able to determine a redshift of 2.341+/-0.001 from\nthree of the four lensed quasar images with the clean forbidden line [C III].\nIn addition, we also derive a maximum outflow velocity of ~ 9800 km/s with the\nbroad absorption features bluewards of the C IV emission line. This value of\nmaximum outflow velocity is in good agreement with other BAL quasars.\n", "  We present a spectroscopic survey of high-redshift, luminous galaxies over\nfour square degrees on the sky, aiming to build a large and homogeneous sample\nof Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\\approx5.7$ and 6.5, and Lyman-break\ngalaxies (LBGs) at $5.5<z<6.8$. The fields that we choose to observe are\nwell-studied, such as SXDS and COSMOS. They have deep optical imaging data in a\nseries of broad and narrow bands, allowing efficient selection of galaxy\ncandidates. Spectroscopic observations are being carried out using the\nmulti-object spectrograph M2FS on the Magellan Clay telescope. M2FS is\nefficient to identify high-redshift galaxies, owing to its 256 optical fibers\ndeployed over a circular field-of-view 30 arcmin in diameter. We have observed\n$\\sim2.5$ square degrees. When the program is completed, we expect to identify\nmore than 400 bright LAEs at $z\\approx5.7$ and 6.5, and a substantial number of\nLBGs at $z\\ge6$. This unique sample will be used to study a variety of galaxy\nproperties and to search for large protoclusters. Furthermore, the statistical\nproperties of these galaxies will be used to probe cosmic reionization. We\ndescribe the motivation, program design, target selection, and M2FS\nobservations. We also outline our science goals, and present a sample of the\nbrightest LAEs at $z\\approx5.7$ and 6.5. This sample contains 32 LAEs with\nLy$\\alpha$ luminosities higher than 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. A few of them reach\n$\\ge3\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, comparable to the two most luminous LAEs\nknown at $z\\ge6$, `CR7' and `COLA1'. These LAEs provide ideal targets to study\nextreme galaxies in the distant universe.\n", "  We report the discovery of two detached double white dwarf (WD) binaries,\nSDSS J082239.546+304857.19 and SDSS J104336.275+055149.90, with orbital periods\nof 40 and 46 min, respectively. The 40 min system is eclipsing; it is composed\nof a 0.30 Msun and a 0.52 Msun WD. The 46 min system is a likely LISA\nverification binary. The short 20 Myr and ~34 Myr gravitational wave merger\ntimes of the two binaries imply that many more such systems have formed and\nmerged over the age of the Milky Way. We update the estimated Milky Way He+CO\nWD binary merger rate and affirm our previously published result: He+CO WD\nbinaries merge at a rate at least 40 times greater than the formation rate of\nstable mass-transfer AM~CVn binaries, and so the majority must have unstable\nmass-transfer. The implication is that spin-orbit coupling in He+CO WD mergers\nis weak, or perhaps nova-like outbursts drive He+CO WDs into merger as proposed\nby Shen.\n", "  We use gas temperature and velocity dispersion data from the Green Bank\nAmmonia Survey and core masses and sizes from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope\nGould Belt Survey to estimate the virial states of dense cores within the Orion\nA molecular cloud. Surprisingly, we find that almost none of the dense cores\nare sufficiently massive to be bound when considering only the balance between\nself-gravity and the thermal and non-thermal motions present in the dense gas.\nIncluding the additional pressure binding imposed by the weight of the ambient\nmolecular cloud material and additional smaller pressure terms, however,\nsuggests that most of the dense cores are pressure confined.\n", "  Neutron star mergers (NSMs) are one of the most plausible sources of\nr-process elements in the universe. Therefore NSMs can also be a major source\nof ultra-heavy elements in cosmic rays. In this paper, we first estimate the\ncontribution of r-process elements synthesized in NSMs to the ultra-heavy\nelement cosmic rays (UHCRs) by calculating transport equations that take into\naccount energy loss processes and spallations. We show that the flux of UHCRs\naccelerated by NSMs themselves fluctuates by many orders of magnitude on the\ntimescale of several million years and can overwhelm UHCRs accelerated by\nsupernova remnants (SNRs) after an NSM takes place within a few kilo-parsec\nfrom the solar system. Experiments with very long exposure times using\nmeteorites as UHCR detectors can detect this fluctuation. As a consequence, we\nshow that if NSMs are the primary source of UHCRs, future experiments using\nmeteorites have a possibility to reveal the event history of NSMs in the solar\nvicinity. We also describe a possible difference in the abundance pattern and\nenergy spectrum of UHCRs between NSM and SNR accelerations.\n", "  In this work, we explore the long-term variability properties of the blazar\nPKS 0219-164 in the radio and the $\\gamma$-ray regime, utilizing the OVRO 15\nGHz and the \\fermi/LAT observations from the period 2008--2017. We found that\n$\\gamma$-ray emission is more variable than the radio emission implying that\n$\\gamma$ ray emission possibly originated in more compact regions while the\nradio emission represented continuum emission from the large scale jets. Also,\nin $\\gamma$-ray the source exhibited spectral variability characterized by the\n\\emph{ softer-when-brighter} trend, a less frequently observed feature in the\nhigh energy emission by BL Lacs. In radio, using Lomb-Scargle periodogram and\nweighted wavelet z-transform, we detected a strong signal of quasi-periodic\noscillation (QPO) with a periodicity of 270 $\\pm$ 26 days with possible\nharmonics of 550 $\\pm$ 42 and 1150 $\\pm$ 157 days periods. At a time when the\nissue of the detection of QPOs in blazars is still under debate, the observed\nQPO with high statistical significance ( $\\sim$ 97\\% -- 99\\% global\nsignificance over underlying red-noise processes) and persistent over nearly 10\noscillations could make one of the strongest cases for the detection of QPOs in\nblazar light curves. We discuss various blazar models that might lead to the\n$\\gamma$-ray and radio variability, QPO, and the achromatic behavior seen in\nthe high energy emission from the source.\n", "  Observations of various solar-type stars along decades revealed that they can\nhave magnetic cycles, just like our Sun. An investigation of the relation\nbetween their cycle length and rotation period can shed light on the dynamo\nmechanisms operating in these stars. Previous works on this relation suggested\nthat the stars could be separated into active and inactive branches, with the\nSun falling between them. In this work, we determined short magnetic activity\ncycles for 6 active solar-type stars observed by the Kepler telescope. The\nmethod adopted here estimates the activity from the excess in the residuals of\nthe transitlight curves. This excess is obtained by subtracting a spotless\nmodel transit from the light curve, and then integrating over all the residuals\nduring the transit. The presence of long term periodicity is estimated from the\nanalysis of a Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the complete time series. Finally, we\ninvestigate the rotation-cycle period relation for the stars analysed here and\nfind that some active stars do not follow the behaviour proposed earlier,\nfalling in the inactive branch. In addition, we also notice a considerable\nspread from other stars in the literature in the active/inactive branches.\n", "  When the interactions between cooperators (C) and defectors (D) can be\npartially avoided within a population, there may be an overall enhancement of\ncooperation. One example of such screening mechanism occurs in the presence of\nrisk-averse agents (loners, L) that are neutral towards others, i.e., both L\nand its opponent, whatever its strategy, receive the same payoff. Their\npresence in the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game sustains the coexistence of\ncooperators and defectors far beyond the level attained in their absence.\nAnother screening mechanism is a heterogeneous landscape obtained, for example,\nby site diluting the lattice. In this case, cooperation is enhanced with some\nfraction of such inactive, interaction-averse sites. By considering the\ninterplay of both mechanisms, we show that there is an explosive increase in\nthe range of densities, just above the percolation threshold, where neutrality\nis prevented and loners become extinct, the behavior reverting to the pure PD\ngame. Interestingly, this occurs despite defectors being usually abundant in\nthat region. This has to be compared with the corresponding loner-free region\nin the undiluted case that, besides being very small, is dominatedby\ncooperators.\n", "  We show that the most distant X-ray detected cluster known to date, ClJ1001\nat z=2.506, hosts a strong overdensity of radio sources. Six of them are\nindividually detected (within 10\") in deep 0.75\" resolution VLA 3GHz imaging,\nwith S(3GHz)>8uJy. Of the six, AGN likely affects the radio emission in two\ngalaxies while star formation is the dominant source powering the remaining\nfour. We searched for cluster candidates over the full COSMOS 2-square degree\nfield using radio-detected 3GHz sources and looking for peaks in Sigma5 density\nmaps. ClJ1001 is the strongest overdensity by far with >10sigma, with a simple\nz_phot>1.5 preselection. A cruder photometric rejection of z<1 radio\nforegrounds leaves ClJ1001 as the second strongest overdensity, while even\nusing all radio sources ClJ1001 remains among the four strongest projected\noverdensities. We conclude that there are great prospects for future, deep and\nwide-area radio surveys to discover large samples of the first generation of\nforming galaxy clusters. In these remarkable structures widespread star\nformation and AGN activity of massive galaxy cluster members, residing within\nthe inner cluster core, will ultimately lead to radio continuum as one of the\nmost effective means for their identification, with detection rates expected in\nthe ballpark of 0.1-1 per square degree at z>2.5. Samples of hundreds such\nhigh-redshift clusters could potentially constrain cosmological parameters and\ntest cluster and galaxy formation models.\n", "  We observe intensity oscillations along coronal fan loops associated with the\nactive region AR 11428. The intensity oscillations were triggered by blast\nwaves which were generated due to X-class flares in the distant active region\nAR 11429. To characterise the nature of oscillations, we created time-distance\nmaps along the fan loops and noted that the intensity oscillations at two ends\nof the loops were out of phase. As we move along the fan loop, the amplitude of\nthe oscillations first decreased and then increased. The out-of-phase nature\ntogether with the amplitude variation along the loop implies that these\noscillations are very likely to be standing waves. The period of the\noscillations are estimated to be $\\sim$27 min, damping time to be $\\sim$45 min\nand phase velocity projected in the plane of sky $\\sim$ 65-83 km s$^{-1}$. The\nprojected phase speeds were in the range of acoustic speed of coronal plasma at\nabout 0.6 MK which further indicates that these are slow waves. To best of our\nknowledge, this is the first report on the existence of the standing slow waves\nin non-flaring fan loops.\n", "  A supervised machine learning algorithm, called locally adaptive discriminant\nanalysis (LADA), has been developed to locate boundaries between identifiable\nimage features that have varying intensities. LADA is an adaptation of image\nsegmentation, which includes techniques that find the positions of image\nfeatures (classes) using statistical intensity distributions for each class in\nthe image. In order to place a pixel in the proper class, LADA considers the\nintensity at that pixel and the distribution of intensities in local (nearby)\npixels. This paper presents the use of LADA to provide, with statistical\nuncertainties, the positions and shapes of features within ultrafast images of\nshock waves. We demonstrate the ability to locate image features including\ncrystals, density changes associated with shock waves, and material jetting\ncaused by shock waves. This algorithm can analyze images that exhibit a wide\nrange of physical phenomena because it does not rely on comparison to a model.\nLADA enables analysis of images from shock physics with statistical rigor\nindependent of underlying models or simulations\n", "  Up to now, mostly relatively simple molecules have been detected in\ninterstellar diffuse molecular clouds in our galaxy, but more complex species\nhave been reported in the diffuse/translucent medium of a z = 0.89 spiral\ngalaxy. We aim at searching for complex organic molecules (COMs) in diffuse\nmolecular clouds along the line of sight to Sgr B2(N), taking advantage of the\nhigh sensitivity and angular resolution of the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We use data acquired as part of the\nEMoCA survey performed with ALMA. To analyse the absorption features of the\nmolecules detected towards the ultracompact HII region K4 in Sgr B2(N), we\ncalculate synthetic spectra for these molecules and fit their column densities,\nline widths, centroid velocities, and excitation temperatures. We report the\ndetection of CH3OH, CH3CN, CH3CHO, HC3N, and NH2CHO in Galactic center (GC)\ndiffuse clouds and CH3OH and CH3CN in a diffuse cloud in the Scutum arm. The\nchemical composition of one of the diffuse GC clouds is found to be similar to\nthe one of the diffuse/translucent medium of the z=0.89 spiral galaxy. The\nchemical processes leading to chemical complexity in the diffuse molecular ISM\nappear to have remained similar since z=0.89. As proposed in previous studies,\nthe presence of COMs in diffuse molecular clouds may result from a cyclical\ninterstellar process of cloud contraction and expansion between diffuse and\ndense states.\n", "  The three-dimensional gravitational velocity field within z~0.1 has been\nmodeled with the Wiener filter methodology applied to the Cosmicflows-3\ncompilation of galaxy distances. The dominant features are a basin of\nattraction and two basins of repulsion. The major basin of attraction is an\nextension of the Shapley concentration of galaxies. One basin of repulsion, the\nDipole Repeller, is located near the anti-apex of the cosmic microwave\nbackground dipole. The other basin of repulsion is in the proximate direction\ntoward the 'Cold Spot' irregularity in the cosmic microwave background. It has\nbeen speculated that a vast void might contribute to the amplitude of the Cold\nSpot from the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect.\n", "  We introduce a non-resonant acceleration mechanism arising from the second\nadiabatic invariant in magnetic turbulence and apply it to study the prompt\nemission spectra of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The mechanism contains both the\nfirst- and second-order Fermi acceleration, originating from the interacting\nturbulent reconnection and dynamo processes. It leads to a hard electron energy\ndistribution up to a cutoff energy at the balance between the acceleration and\nsynchrotron cooling. The sufficient acceleration rate ensures a rapid hardening\nof any initial energy distribution to a power-law distribution with the index\n$p \\sim 1$, which naturally produces a low-energy photon index $\\alpha \\sim -1$\nvia the synchrotron radiation. For typical GRB parameters, the synchrotron\nemission can extend to a characteristic photon energy on the order of $\\sim\n100$ keV.\n", "  Dynamical mass estimates down to the planet-mass regime can help to\nunderstand planet formation. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) 1.3 mm observations of FW Tau C, a proposed ~10 $M_{\\rm Jup}$\nplanet-mass companion at ~330 au from the host binary FW Tau AB. We spatially\nand spectrally resolve the accretion disk of FW Tau C in ${}^{12}$CO (2-1). By\nmodeling the Keplerian rotation of gas, we derive a dynamical mass of ~0.1\n$M_\\odot$. Therefore, FW Tau C is unlikely a planet, but rather a low-mass star\nwith a highly inclined disk. This also suggests that FW Tau is a triple system\nconsisting of three ~0.1 $M_\\odot$ stars.\n", "  We collect a sample of 78 Fermi detected blazars with broad line region (BLR)\ndata and the quasi-simultaneous multi-wave band data. By analyzing the sample,\nwe find: (1) For whole blazar sample, there exist significant correlations\nbetween radio, $\\gamma$-ray luminosity and BLR luminosity. The slope of the\nbest-fit linear regression equation is close to the theoretical value 1. Our\nresults provided another support of jet-disk symbiosis. (2) For FSRQ sample, we\nfind a significant correlation between radio luminosity and optical luminosity,\nand weaker correlations between X-ray luminosity and radio, optical luminosity.\nIt indicates that the X-ray band radiation mechanism is slightly different from\nradio and optical bands. The X-ray emission is diluted by inverse Compton\nscattering (IC). There is a significant correlation between BLR luminosity and\n$\\gamma$-ray luminosity, but no correlations between X-ray luminosity and BLR,\n$\\gamma$-ray luminosity, which suggests that the seed soft photons are\ndifferent for IC process. From these results we suggest that the X-ray band\nemission is diluted by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process, $\\gamma$-ray\nband emission is produced by external Compton (EC) process.\n", "  Climate models are often affected by long-term drift that is revealed by the\nevolution of global variables such as the ocean temperature or the surface air\ntemperature. This spurious trend reduces the fidelity to initial conditions and\nhas a great influence on the equilibrium climate after long simulation times.\nUseful insight on the nature of the climate drift can be obtained using two\nglobal metrics, i.e. the energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere and at\nthe ocean surface. The former is an indicator of the limitations within a given\nclimate model, at the level of both numerical implementation and physical\nparameterisations, while the latter is an indicator of the goodness of the\ntuning procedure. Using the MIT general circulation model, we construct\ndifferent configurations with various degree of complexity (i.e. different\nparameterisations for the bulk cloud albedo, inclusion or not of friction\nheating, different bathymetry configurations) to which we apply the same tuning\nprocedure in order to obtain control runs for fixed external forcing where the\nclimate drift is minimised. We find that the interplay between tuning procedure\nand different configurations of the same climate model provides crucial\ninformation on the stability of the control runs and on the goodness of a given\nparameterisation. This approach is particularly relevant for constructing\ngood-quality control runs of the geological past where huge uncertainties are\nfound in both initial and boundary conditions. We will focus on robust results\nthat can be generally applied to other climate models.\n", "  Comparing the images of the jet of the young star RW Aur A, separated by a\nperiod of 21.3 years, we found that the outermost jet's knots have emerged\n$\\approx 350$ yr ago. We argue that at that moment the jet itself has appeared\nand intensive accretion onto the star has began due to the rearrangement of its\nprotoplanetary disk structure caused by the tidal effect of the companion RW\nAur B. More precisely, we assume that the increase of accretion is a response\nto changing conditions in the outer disk regions, which followed after the\nsound wave, generated by these changes, crossed the disk in a radial direction.\nThe difference in the parameters of the blue and red lobes of the RW Aur A jet,\naccording to our opinion, is a result of the asymmetric distribution of the\ncircumstellar matter above and below the disk, due to a fly-by of the\ncompanion. It was found from the analysis of RW Aur historical light curve that\ndeep and long $(\\Delta t>150$ days) dimmings of RW Aur A observed after 2010\nyr, had no analogues in the previous 110 years. We also associate the change in\nthe character of the photometric variability of the star with the rearrangement\nof the structure of inner $(r<1$ a.u.) regions of its protoplanetary disk and\ndiscuss why these changes began only 350 years after the beginning of the\nactive accretion phase.\n", "  The interaction between a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and the surrounding\nmaterial is of primary importance in modern astrophysics. The detection of the\nmolecular 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately around the Milky Way SMBH,\nSgrA*, provides an unique opportunity to study SMBH accretion at sub-parsec\nscales. Our new wide-field CS(2-1) map toward the Galactic center (GC) reveals\nmultiple dense molecular streamers originated from the ambient clouds 20-pc\nfurther out, and connecting to the central 2 parsecs of the CND. These dense\ngas streamers appear to carry gas directly toward the nuclear region and might\nbe captured by the central potential. Our phase-plot analysis indicates that\nthese streamers show a signature of rotation and inward radial motion with\nprogressively higher velocities as the gas approaches the CND and finally ends\nup co-rotating with the CND. Our results might suggest a possible mechanism of\ngas feeding the CND from 20 pc around 2 pc in the GC. In this paper, we discuss\nthe morphology and the kinematics of these streamers. As the nearest observable\nGalactic nucleus, this feeding process may have implications for understanding\nthe processes in extragalactic nuclei.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection is a well-accepted part of the theory of solar eruptive\nevents, though the evidence is still circumstantial. Intrinsic to the\nreconnection picture of a solar eruptive event, particularly in the standard\nmodel for two-ribbon flares (\"CSHKP\" model), are an advective flow of\nmagnetized plasma into the reconnection region, expansion of field above the\nreconnection region as a flux rope erupts, retraction of heated\npost-reconnection loops, and downflows of cooling plasma along those loops. We\nreport on a unique set of SDO/AIA imaging and Hinode/EIS spectroscopic\nobservations of the disk flare SOL2016-03-23T03:54 in which all four flows are\npresent simultaneously. This includes spectroscopic evidence for a plasma\nupflow in association with large-scale expanding closed inflow field. The\nreconnection inflows are symmetric, and consistent with fast reconnection, and\nthe post-reconnection loops show a clear cooling and deceleration as they\nretract. Observations of coronal reconnection flows are still rare, and most\nevents are observed at the solar limb, obscured by complex foregrounds, making\ntheir relationship to the flare ribbons, cusp field and arcades formed in the\nlower atmosphere difficult to interpret. The disk location and favorable\nperspective of this event have removed these ambiguities giving a clear picture\nof the reconnection dynamics.\n", "  In this work, we investigate interactions that simultaneously order a system\nlocally, while keeping it globally disordered. The study is done in the context\nof the emergence of diversity in opinion propagation models with interactions\nrooted in conformity, but some suggestions on how this could be extended to\nother topics (like ecology and neuroscience) are also made. We do this by\nintroducing a generic modification that can be added to different opinion\npropagation models (and other agent based models) and that seems to introduce a\nglobal tendency towards diversity without leading the system to a frozen state,\neven in the absence of thermal noises, contrarian agents or cyclic\ninteractions. This modification consists of effectively introducing a\nrelaxation period right after an agent changes its state, during which it\ncannot change its state again. We tested this modification for the voter model\nin a square lattice and verified that in the thermodynamic limit, the only\nattractor is the completely disordered state, where all opinions coexist in the\nsame proportion. For fixed lattice sizes, finite size effects cause a\ntransition with the lenght of the relaxation period between coexistence and\nconsensus. We made simulations for 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 opinions in a square\nlattice and mean field calculations for an arbitrary number of opinions.\n", "  We report on the X-ray dust-scattering features observed around the afterglow\nof the gamma ray burst GRB 160623A. With an XMM-Newton observation carried out\n~2 days after the burst, we found evidence of at least six rings, with angular\nsize expanding between ~2 and 9 arcmin, as expected for X-ray scattering of the\nprompt GRB emission by dust clouds in our Galaxy. From the expansion rate of\nthe rings, we measured the distances of the dust layers with extraordinary\nprecision: 528.1 +\\- 1.2 pc, 679.2 +\\- 1.9 pc, 789.0 +\\- 2.8 pc, 952 +\\- 5 pc,\n1539 +\\- 20 pc and 5079 +\\- 64 pc. A spectral analysis of the ring spectra,\nbased on an appropriate dust-scattering model (BARE-GR-B from Zubko et al.\n2004}) and the estimated burst fluence, allowed us to derive the column density\nof the individual dust layers, which are in the range 7x10^20-1.5x10^22 cm^-2.\nThe farthest dust-layer (i.e. the one responsible for the smallest ring) is\nalso the one with the lowest column density and it is possibly very extended,\nindicating a diffuse dust region. The properties derived for the six\ndust-layers (distance, thickness, and optical depth) are generally in good\nagreement with independent information on the reddening along this line of\nsight and on the distribution of molecular and atomic gas.\n", "  Quantifying image distortions caused by strong gravitational lensing and\nestimating the corresponding matter distribution in lensing galaxies has been\nprimarily performed by maximum likelihood modeling of observations. This is\ntypically a time and resource-consuming procedure, requiring sophisticated\nlensing codes, several data preparation steps, and finding the maximum\nlikelihood model parameters in a computationally expensive process with\ndownhill optimizers. Accurate analysis of a single lens can take up to a few\nweeks and requires the attention of dedicated experts. Tens of thousands of new\nlenses are expected to be discovered with the upcoming generation of ground and\nspace surveys, the analysis of which can be a challenging task. Here we report\nthe use of deep convolutional neural networks to accurately estimate lensing\nparameters in an extremely fast and automated way, circumventing the\ndifficulties faced by maximum likelihood methods. We also show that lens\nremoval can be made fast and automated using Independent Component Analysis of\nmulti-filter imaging data. Our networks can recover the parameters of the\nSingular Isothermal Ellipsoid density profile, commonly used to model strong\nlensing systems, with an accuracy comparable to the uncertainties of\nsophisticated models, but about ten million times faster: 100 systems in\napproximately 1s on a single graphics processing unit. These networks can\nprovide a way for non-experts to obtain lensing parameter estimates for large\nsamples of data. Our results suggest that neural networks can be a powerful and\nfast alternative to maximum likelihood procedures commonly used in\nastrophysics, radically transforming the traditional methods of data reduction\nand analysis.\n", "  We report magnetotransport study on type-II Weyl semimetal WP$_2$ single\ncrystals. Magnetoresistance (MR) exhibits a nonsaturating $H^{n}$ field\ndependence (14,300\\% at 2 K and 9 T) whereas systematic violation of Kohler's\nrule was observed. Quantum oscillations reveal a complex multiband electronic\nstructure. The cyclotron effective mass close to the mass of free electron\nm$_e$ was observed in quantum oscillations along $b$-axis, while reduced\neffective mass of about 0.5$m_e$ was observed in $a$-axis quantum oscillations,\nsuggesting Fermi surface anisotropy. Temperature dependence of the resistivity\nshows a large upturn that cannot be explained by the multi-band\nmagnetoresistance of conventional metals. Even though crystal structure of\nWP$_{2}$ is not layered as in transition metal dichalcogenides, quantum\noscillations suggest partial two-dimensional character.\n", "  The ratio in number between unobscured (type 1) and obscured (type 2) AGNs is\noften used to explore the structure of the torus in the unified scheme for\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs). Oh et al. (2015) investigated the type 1 AGN\nfraction on two-dimensional space in terms of black hole mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$)\nand bolometric luminosity ($L_{\\rm bol}$) and found that the fraction changes\ndepending on both $M_{\\rm BH}$ and $L_{\\rm bol}$, forming a ridge-shaped\ndistribution. In this study, based on the up-to-date type 1 AGN catalog of Oh\net al. (2015), we examine how the trend of the type 1 AGN fraction in the\n$M_{\\rm BH}-L_{\\rm bol}$ plane is affected by the different methods used to\nderive $M_{\\rm BH}$ and $L_{\\rm bol}$, and suggest an analytic model to explain\nthe observations. We use galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data\nRelease 7 in the redshift range of $0.01 \\leq z \\leq 0.2$. In estimating\n$L_{\\rm bol}$, we employ two different methods using [O III] and/or [O I]\nemission lines, and find that the $L_{\\rm bol}$ values obtained from the two\nmethods agree well. We consider the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma_*$ relation, the $M_{\\rm\nBH}-L_{\\rm bulge}$ relation and the single-epoch H$\\alpha$-based $M_{\\rm BH}$\nestimate in calculating $M_{\\rm BH}$. We find that the trends of the type 1 AGN\nfraction with respect to $M_{\\rm BH}$ and $L_{\\rm bol}$ are similar for the\ndifferent derivation methods for $L_{\\rm bol}$ but different when using\ndifferent methods to derive $M_{\\rm BH}$. We present a model based on the\nclumpy-torus scheme that reproduces the ridge-shaped distribution of the\nfraction parallel to the iso-Eddington ratio lines.\n", "  High-speed 100 MHz strain monitor using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and an\noptical filter has been devised for the magnetostriction measurements under\nultrahigh magnetic fields. The longitudinal magnetostriction of LaCoO$_{3}$ has\nbeen measured at room temperature, 115, 7 and 4.2 K up to the maximum magnetic\nfield of 150 T. The field-induced lattice elongations are observed, which are\nattributed to the spin-state crossover from the low-spin ground state to\nexcited spin-states.\n", "  Endohedral lanthanide ions packed inside carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a\none-dimensional assembly have been studied with a combination of high\nresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning transmission\nX-ray microscopy (STXM), and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). By\ncorrelating HRTEM and STXM images we show that structures down to 30 nm are\nresolved with chemical contrast and record X-ray absorption spectra from\nendohedral lanthanide ions embedded in individual nanoscale CNT bundles. XMCD\nmeasurements of an Er$_3$N@C$_{80}$ bulk sample and a macroscopic assembly of\nfilled CNTs indicates that the magnetic properties of the endohedral Er3+ ions\nare unchanged when encapsulated in CNTs. This study demonstrates the\nfeasibility of local magnetic X-ray characterization of low concentrations of\nlanthanide ions embedded in molecular nanostructures.\n", "  Local models of gaseous accretion discs have been successfully employed for\ndecades to describe an assortment of small-scale phenomena, from instabilities\nand turbulence, to dust dynamics and planet formation. For the most part, they\nhave been derived in a physically motivated but essentially ad hoc fashion,\nwith some of the mathematical assumptions never made explicit nor checked for\nconsistency. This approach is susceptible to error, and it is easy to derive\nlocal models that support spurious instabilities or fail to conserve key\nquantities. In this paper we present rigorous derivations, based on an\nasympototic ordering, and formulate a hierarchy of local models\n(incompressible, Boussinesq, and compressible), making clear which is best\nsuited for a particular flow or phenomenon while spelling out explicitly the\nassumptions and approximations of each. We also discuss the merits of the\nanelastic approximation, emphasising that anelastic systems struggle to\nconserve energy unless strong restrictions are imposed on the flow. The\nproblems encountered by the anelastic approximation are exacerbated by the\ndisk's differential rotation, but also attend non-rotating systems such as\nstellar interiors. We conclude with a defence of local models and their\ncontinued utility in astrophysical research.\n", "  Recently a new theory for the transport of energetic particles across a mean\nmagnetic field was presented. Compared to other non-linear theories the new\napproach has the advantage that it provides a full time-dependent description\nof the transport. Furthermore, a diffusion approximation is no longer part of\nthat theory. It is the purpose of the current paper to combine this new\napproach with a time-dependent model for parallel transport and different\nturbulence configurations in order to explore the parameter regimes for which\nwe get ballistic transport, compound sub-diffusion, and normal Markovian\ndiffusion.\n", "  Thick disk evolution is studied using edge-on galaxies in two Hubble Space\nTelescope Frontier Field Parallels. The galaxies were separated into 72 clumpy\ntypes and 35 spiral types with bulges. Perpendicular light profiles in F435W,\nF606W and F814W (B, V and I) passbands were measured at 1 pixel intervals along\nthe major axes and fitted to sech^2 functions convolved with the instrument\nline spread function (LSF). The LSF was determined from the average point\nspread function (PSF) of ~20 stars in each passband and field, convolved with a\nline of uniform brightness to simulate disk blurring. A spread function for a\nclumpy disk was also used for comparison. The resulting scale heights were\nfound to be proportional to galactic mass, with the average height for a\n10^9.5-10^10.5 Msun galaxy at z=1.5-2.5 equal to 0.63+-0.24 kpc. This value is\nprobably the result of a blend between thin and thick disk components that\ncannot be resolved. Evidence for such two-component structure is present in an\ninverse correlation between height and midplane surface brightness. Models\nsuggest that the thick disk is observed best between the clumps, and there the\naverage scale height is 1.06+-0.43 kpc for the same mass and redshift. A\n0.63+-0.68 mag V-I color differential with height is also evidence for a\nmixture of thin and thick components.\n", "  The solar metallicity issue is a long-lasting problem of astrophysics,\nimpacting multi- ple fields and still subject to debate and uncertainties.\nWhile spectroscopy has mostly been used to determine the solar heavy elements\nabundance, helioseismologists at- tempted providing a seismic determination of\nthe metallicity in the solar convective enveloppe. However, the puzzle remains\nsince two independent groups prodived two radically different values for this\ncrucial astrophysical parameter. We aim at provid- ing an independent seismic\nmeasurement of the solar metallicity in the convective enveloppe. Our main goal\nis to help provide new information to break the current stalemate amongst\nseismic determinations of the solar heavy element abundance. We start by\npresenting the kernels, the inversion technique and the target function of the\ninversion we have developed. We then test our approach in multiple\nhare-and-hounds exercises to assess its reliability and accuracy. We then apply\nour technique to solar data using calibrated solar models and determine an\ninterval of seismic measurements for the solar metallicity. We show that our\ninversion can indeed be used to estimate the solar metallicity thanks to our\nhare-and-hounds exercises. However, we also show that further dependencies in\nthe physical ingredients of solar models lead to a low accuracy. Nevertheless,\nusing various physical ingredients for our solar models, we determine\nmetallicity values between 0.008 and 0.014.\n", "  The conversion of magnetic energy into other forms during solar flares is one\nof the outstanding open problems in solar physics. It is generally accepted\nthat magnetic reconnection plays a crucial role in these conversion processes.\nTo achieve the rapid energy release required in solar flares, an anomalous\nresistivity, orders of magnitude higher than the Spitzer resistivity, is often\nused in MHD simulations of reconnection. Spitzer resistivity is based on\nCoulomb scattering, which becomes negligible at the high energies achieved by\naccelerated particles. As a result, simulations of particle acceleration in\nreconnection events are often performed in the absence of any interaction\nbetween accelerated particles and any background plasma. This need not be the\ncase for scattering associated with anomalous resistivity caused by turbulence\nwithin solar flares, as the higher resistivity implies an elevated scattering\nrate. We present results of test particle calculations, with and without pitch\nangle scattering, subject to fields derived from MHD simulations of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) X-point reconnection. Scattering rates proportional to the\nratio of the anomalous resistivity to the local Spitzer resistivity, as well as\nat fixed values, are considered. Pitch angle scattering, which is independent\nof the anomalous resistivity, causes higher maximum energies in comparison to\nthose obtained without scattering. Scattering rates which are dependent on the\nlocal anomalous resistivity tend to produce fewer highly energised particles\ndue to weaker scattering in the separatrices, even though scattering in the\ncurrent sheet may be stronger when compared to resistivity-independent\nscattering. Strong scattering also causes an increase in the number of\nparticles exiting the computational box in the reconnection outflow region, as\nopposed to along the separatrices as is the case in the absence of scattering.\n", "  The luminescence of fifteen representative Eu$^{2+}$-doped phosphors used for\nwhite-LED and scintillation applications is studied through a Constrained\nDensity Functional Theory. Transition energies and Stokes shift are deduced\nfrom differences of total energies between the ground and excited states of the\nsystems, in the absorption and emission geometries. The general applicability\nof such methodology is first assessed: for this representative set, the\ncalculated absolute error with respect to experiment on absorption and emission\nenergies is within 0.3 eV. This set of compounds covers a wide range of\ntransition energies that extents from 1.7 to 3.5 eV. The information gained\nfrom the relaxed geometries and total energies is further used to evaluate the\nthermal barrier for the $4f-5d$ crossover, the full width at half-maximum of\nthe emission spectrum and the temperature shift of the emission peak, using a\none-dimensional configuration-coordinate model. The former results indicate\nthat the $4f-5d$ crossover cannot be the dominant mechanism for the thermal\nquenching behavior of Eu$^{2+}$-doped phosphors and the latter results are\ncompared to available experimental data and yield a 30$\\%$ mean absolute\nrelative error. Finally, a semi-empirical model used previously for\nCe$^{3+}$-doped hosts is adapted to Eu$^{2+}$-doped hosts and gives the\nabsorption and emission energies within 0.9 eV of experiment, underperforming\ncompared to the first-principles calculation.\n", "  We analyze the emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b using our\nHELIOS-R retrieval code and HELIOS-K opacity calculator. When interpreting\nHubble and Spitzer data, the retrieval outcomes are found to be\nprior-dominated. When the prior distributions of the molecular abundances are\nassumed to be log-uniform, the volume mixing ratio of HCN is found to be\nimplausibly high. A VULCAN chemical kinetics model of WASP-12b suggests that\nchemical equilibrium is a reasonable assumption even when atmospheric mixing is\nimplausibly rigorous. Guided by (exo)planet formation theory, we set Gaussian\npriors on the elemental abundances of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen with the\nGaussian peaks being centered on the measured C/H, O/H and N/H values of the\nstar. By enforcing chemical equilibrium, we find substellar O/H and stellar to\nslightly superstellar C/H for the dayside atmosphere of WASP-12b. The\nsuperstellar carbon-to-oxygen ratio is just above unity, regardless of whether\nclouds are included in the retrieval analysis, consistent with Madhusudhan et\nal. (2011). Furthermore, whether a temperature inversion exists in the\natmosphere depends on one's assumption for the Gaussian width of the priors.\nOur retrieved posterior distributions are consistent with the formation of\nWASP-12b in a solar-composition protoplanetary disk, beyond the water iceline,\nvia gravitational instability or pebble accretion (without core erosion) and\nmigration inwards to its present orbital location via a disk-free mechanism,\nand are inconsistent with both in-situ formation and core accretion with disk\nmigration, as predicted by Madhusudhan et al. (2017). We predict that the\ninterpretation of James Webb Space Telescope WASP-12b data will not be\nprior-dominated.\n", "  Although stars accrete mass throughout the first few Myr of their lives, the\nphysical mechanism that drives disk accretion in the T Tauri phase is\nuncertain, and diagnostics that probe the nature of disk accretion have been\nelusive, particularly in the planet formation region of the disk. Here we\nexplore whether an accretion process such as the magnetorotational instability\ncould be detected through its \"heat signature\", the energy it deposits in the\ndisk atmosphere. To examine this possibility, we investigate the impact of\naccretion-related mechanical heating and energetic stellar irradiation (FUV and\nX-rays) on the thermal-chemical properties of disk atmospheres at planet\nformation distances. We find that stellar FUV irradiation (Lyman alpha and\ncontinuum), through its role in heating and photodissociation, affects much of\nthe upper warm (400-2000 K) molecular layer of the atmosphere, and the\nproperties of the layer are generally in good agreement with the observed\nmolecular emission features of disks at UV, near-infrared, and mid-infrared\nwavelengths. At the same time, the effect of FUV irradiation is restricted to\nthe upper molecular layer of the disk, even when irradiation by Ly alpha is\nincluded. The region immediately below the FUV-heated layer is potentially\ndominated by accretion-related mechanical heating. As cooler (90-400 K) CO,\nwater, and other molecules are potential diagnostics of the mechanically-heated\nlayer, emission line studies of these diagnostics might be used to search for\nevidence of the magnetorotational instability in action.\n", "  High obscuration of background stars behind dark clouds precludes the\ndetection of optical diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) and hence our knowledge\nof DIB carriers in these environments. Taking advantage of the reduced\nobscuration of star-light in the near-infrared (NIR) we used one of the\nstrongest NIR DIBs at 15273 AA to probe the presence and properties of its\ncarrier throughout the nearby interstellar dark cloud Barnard 68. Equivalent\nwidths (EW) have been measured for different ranges of visual extinction AV,\nusing VLT-KMOS H-band (1.46-1.85 micron) moderate-resolution (R = 4000) spectra\nof 43 stars situated behind the cloud. To do so we fitted the data using\nsynthetic stellar spectra from the APOGEE project and TAPAS synthetic telluric\ntransmissions appropriate for the observing site and time period. The results\nshow an increase of DIB EW with increasing AV. However, the rate of increase is\nmuch flatter than expected from the EW-AV quasi-proportionality established for\nthis DIB in the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium. Based on a simplified\ninversion assuming sphericity, it is found that the volume density of the DIB\ncarrier is 2.7 and 7.9 times lower than this expected average value in the\nexternal and central regions of the cloud which have n(H)= 0.4 and 3.5 x 105\ncm3, respectively. Further measurements with multiplex NIR spectrographs should\nallow detailed modeling of such an edge effect of this DIB and other bands and\nhelp to clarify its actual origin.\n", "  Nine recently discovered long-period comets were observed by the Solar Wind\nAnisotropies (SWAN) Lyman-alpha all-sky camera on board the Solar and\nHeliosphere Observatory (SOHO) satellite during the period of 2013 to 2016.\nThese were C/2012 K1 (PanSTARRS), C/2013 US10 (Catalina), C/2013 V5\n(Oukaimeden), C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy), C/2014 E2 (Jacques), C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy),\nC/2015 G2 (MASTER), C/2014 Q1 (PanSTARRS) and C/2013 X1 (PanSTARRS). Of these 9\ncomets 6 were long-period comets and 3 were possibly dynamically new. Water\nproduction rates were calculated from each of the 885 images using our standard\ntime-resolved model that accounts for the whole water photodissociation chain,\nexothermic velocities and collisional escape of H atoms. For most of these\ncomets there were enough observations over a broad enough range of heliocentric\ndistances to calculate power-law fits to the variation of production rate with\nheliocentric distances for pre- and post-perihelion portions of the orbits.\nComet C/2014 Q1 (PanSTARRS), with a perihelion distance of only ~0.3 AU, showed\nthe most unusual variation of water production rate with heliocentric distance\nand the resulting active area variation, indicating that when the comet was\nwithin 0.7 AU its activity was dominated by the continuous release of icy\ngrains and chunks, greatly increasing the active sublimation area by more than\na factor of 10 beyond what it had at larger heliocentric distances. A possible\ninterpretation suggests that a large fraction of the comet's mass was lost\nduring the apparition.\n", "  The photoionization of a helium atom by short intense laser pulses is studied\ntheoretically in the vicinity of the $2s2p\\,^1P$ doubly-excited state with the\nintention to investigate the impact of the intensity and duration of the\nexciting pulse on the dynamics of the autoionization process. For that purpose,\nwe solve numerically the corresponding time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\nby applying the time-dependent restricted-active-space\nconfiguration-interaction method (TD-RASCI). The present numerical results\nclearly demonstrate that the Fano-interferences can be controlled by a single\nhigh-frequency pulse. As long as the pulse duration is comparable to the\nautoionization lifetime, varying the peak intensity of the pulse enables\nmanipulation of the underlying Fano-interference. In particular, the asymmetric\nprofile observed for the $2s2p\\,^1P$ doubly-excited state of He in the\nweak-field ionization can be smoothly transformed to a window-type interference\nprofile.\n", "  We present a three-species multi-fluid MHD model (H$^+$, H$_2$O$^+$ and\ne$^-$), endowed with the requisite atmospheric chemistry, that is capable of\naccurately quantifying the magnitude of water ion losses from exoplanets. We\napply this model to a water world with Earth-like parameters orbiting a\nSun-like star for three cases: (i) current normal solar wind conditions, (ii)\nancient normal solar wind conditions, and (iii) one extreme \"Carrington-type\"\nspace weather event. We demonstrate that the ion escape rate for (ii), with a\nvalue of 6.0$\\times$10$^{26}$ s$^{-1}$, is about an order of magnitude higher\nthan the corresponding value of 6.7$\\times$10$^{25}$ s$^{-1}$ for (i). Studies\nof ion losses induced by space weather events, where the ion escape rates can\nreach $\\sim$ 10$^{28}$ s$^{-1}$, are crucial for understanding how an active,\nearly solar-type star (e.g., with frequent coronal mass ejections) could have\naccelerated the depletion of the exoplanet's atmosphere. We briefly explore the\nramifications arising from the loss of water ions, especially for planets\norbiting M-dwarfs where such effects are likely to be significant.\n", "  We report the first detection of extended neutral hydrogen (HI) gas in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) of a massive elliptical galaxy beyond z~0. The\nobservations utilize the doubly lensed images of QSO HE 0047-1756 at z_QSO =\n1.676 as absorption-line probes of the ISM in the massive (M_star ~ 10^11\nM_sun) elliptical lens at z = 0.408, detecting gas at projected distances of d\n= 3.3 and 4.6 kpc on opposite sides of the lens. Using the Space Telescope\nImaging Spectrograph (STIS), we obtain UV absorption spectra of the lensed QSO\nand identify a prominent flux discontinuity and associated absorption features\nmatching the Lyman series transitions at z = 0.408 in both sightlines. The HI\ncolumn density is log N(HI) = 19.6-19.7 at both locations across the lens,\ncomparable to what is seen in 21 cm images of nearby ellipticals. The HI gas\nkinematics are well-matched with the kinematics of the FeII absorption complex\nrevealed in ground-based echelle data, displaying a large velocity shear of 360\nkm/s across the galaxy. We estimate an ISM Fe abundance of 0.3-0.4 solar at\nboth locations. Including likely dust depletions increases the estimated Fe\nabundances to solar or supersolar, similar to those of the hot ISM and stars of\nnearby ellipticals. Assuming 100% covering fraction of this Fe-enriched gas,we\ninfer a total Fe mass of M_cool(Fe)~(5-8)x10^4 M_sun in the cool ISM of the\nmassive elliptical lens, which is no more than 5% of the total Fe mass observed\nin the hot ISM.\n", "  A new magnetic field-generation mechanism based on the Nernst effect is\nconsidered in hot massive stars. This mechanism can operate in the upper\natmospheres of O and B stars where departures from the LTE form a region with\nthe inverse temperature gradient.\n", "  Where is the solar dynamo located and what is its modus operandi? These are\nstill open questions in solar physics. Helio- and asteroseismology can help\nanswer them by enabling us to study solar and stellar internal structures\nthrough global oscillations. The properties of solar and stellar acoustic modes\nare changing with the level of magnetic activity. However, until now, the\ninference on subsurface magnetic fields with seismic measures has been very\nlimited. The aim of this paper is to develop a formalism to calculate the\neffect of large-scale toroidal magnetic fields on solar and stellar global\noscillation eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies. If the Lorentz force is added\nto the equilibrium equation of motion, stellar eigenmodes can couple. In\nquasi-degenerate perturbation theory, this coupling, also known as the direct\neffect, can be quantified by the general matrix element. We present the\nanalytical expression of the matrix element for a superposition of subsurface\nzonal toroidal magnetic field configurations. The matrix element is important\nfor forward calculations of perturbed solar and stellar eigenfunctions and\nfrequency perturbations. The results presented here will help to ascertain\nsolar and stellar large-scale subsurface magnetic fields, and their geometric\nconfiguration, strength, and their change over the course of activity cycles.\n", "  The rigorous finite-temperature QED formalism of the polarization tensor is\nused to study the combined effect of nonzero mass gap $m$ and chemical\npotential $\\mu$ on the Casimir force and its thermal correction in the\nexperimentally relevant configuration of a Au sphere interacting with a real\ngraphene sheet or with graphene-coated dielectric substrates made of different\nmaterials. It is shown that for both a free-standing graphene sheet and for\ngraphene-coated substrates the magnitude of the Casimir force decreases as $m$\nis increased, while it increases as $\\mu$ is increased, indicating that these\nparameters act in opposite directions. According to our results, the impact of\n$m$ and/or $\\mu$ on the Casimir force for graphene-coated plates is much\nsmaller than for a free-standing graphene sheet. Furthermore, computations show\nthat the Casimir force is much stronger for graphene-coated substrates than for\na free-standing graphene sample, but the thermal correction and its fractional\nweight in the total force are smaller in the former case. These results are\napplied to a differential setup that was recently proposed to observe the giant\nthermal effect in the Casimir force for graphene. We show that this experiment\nremains feasible even after taking into account the influence of the nonzero\nmass-gap and chemical potential of real graphene samples. Possible further\napplications of the obtained results are discussed.\n", "  From what is known today about the elementary particles of matter, and the\nforces that control their behavior, it may be observed that still a host of\nobstacles must be overcome that are standing in the way of further progress of\nour understanding. Most researchers conclude that drastically new concepts must\nbe investigated, new starting points are needed, older structures and theories,\nin spite of their successes, will have to be overthrown, and new,\nsuperintelligent questions will have to be asked and investigated. In short,\nthey say that we shall need new physics. Here, we argue in a different manner.\nToday, no prototype, or toy model, of any so-called Theory of Everything\nexists, because the demands required of such a theory appear to be conflicting.\nThe demands that we propose include locality, special and general relativity,\ntogether with a fundamental finiteness not only of the forces and amplitudes,\nbut also of the set of Nature's dynamical variables. We claim that the two\nremaining ingredients that we have today, Quantum Field Theory and General\nRelativity, indeed are coming a long way towards satisfying such elementary\nrequirements. Putting everything together in a Grand Synthesis is like solving\na gigantic puzzle. We argue that we need the correct analytical tools to solve\nthis puzzle. Finally, it seems to be obvious that this solution will give room\nneither for \"Divine Intervention\", nor for \"Free Will\", an observation that,\nall by itself, can be used as a clue. We claim that this reflects on our\nunderstanding of the deeper logic underlying quantum mechanics.\n", "  In this review we summarise the current status of the quasi-static\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The energy spectrum is steeper than\nKolmogorov's $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum due to the decrease of the kinetic energy flux\nwith wavenumber $k$ as a result of Joule dissipation. The spectral index\ndecreases with the increase of interaction parameter. The flow is quasi\ntwo-dimensional with strong ${\\bf U}_\\perp$ at small $k$ and weak $U_\\parallel$\nat large $k$, where ${\\bf U}_\\perp$ and $U_\\parallel$ are the perpendicular and\nparallel components of velocity relative to the external magnetic field. For\nsmall $k$, the energy flux of ${\\bf U}_\\perp$ is negative, but for large $k$,\nthe energy flux of $U_\\parallel$ is positive. Pressure mediates the energy\ntransfer from ${\\bf U}_\\perp$ to $U_\\parallel$.\n", "  The normal modes of oscillation for a magnetic arcade are used to\nanalytically solve an initial value problem and estimate the power spectra of\nwave frequencies generated by a reconnection event in the solar corona. Over a\nrealistic range of parameters, I find that such a disturbance generates a peak\npower at $\\sim10$s$\\mathrm{mHz}$ frequencies, but still substantial power up to\n$\\sim4\\mathrm{Hz}$. The cadence and sensitivity of current instrumentation does\nnot allow observations of oscillations at these frequencies, but in the near\nfuture, new instrumentation will be able to probe this regime, and\nobservationally determine its energetic importance.\n", "  This study uses two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy in conjunction\nwith isotope labeling and spectral modeling from molecular dynamics simulations\nto identify the dominant turn conformations that exist in equilibrium ensembles\nof the (VPGVG)n family of intrinsically disordered elastin-like peptides.\nNumerous models have been proposed to explain the origins of elastin's\nelasticity and its counterintuitive ability to become structured upon heating.\nHowever, the structure of elastin remains unassigned because none of the\ntechniques currently used to study highly disordered amino acid sequences have\na time resolution that is faster than the lifetime of a transient conformation\nin a disordered sequence. Because these conformations exchange on time scales\nlonger than the 5-6 ps required for 2D IR measurements, isotope-edited 2D IR\nspectroscopy was chosen to study this family of peptides. This study first\nexamined the small GVGVPGVG peptide at a series of temperatures and salt\nconcentrations to assign its dominant turn conformations and to determine what\nvariables alter the populations of these conformations. These data were then\nused to identify the dominant turn conformations that exist in larger\nelastin-like peptides including (GVGVP)251. The results indicate that the\n(VPGVG)n family of elastin-like peptides contain a high population of both an\nirregular turn structure with 2 peptide-peptide hydrogen bonds to the proline\namide C=O group and a conventional turn structure with 1 peptide-peptide\nhydrogen bond to the proline amide C=O group. These turn structures are\ndurable, showing a significant population of closed turns at all temperatures\nand salt concentrations studied.\n", "  The effective diffusivity $D_e$ of tracer particles diffusing in periodically\ncorrugated axisymmetric two and three dimensional channels is studied. The\nmajority of previous studies of this class of problems are based on\nperturbative analyses about narrow channels, where the problem can be reduced\nto an effectively one dimensional one. Here we show how to analyze this class\nof problems using a much more general approach which even includes the limit of\ninfinitely wide channels. Using the narrow and wide channel asymptotics, we\nprovide a Pad{\\'e} approximant scheme that is able to describe the dispersion\nproperties of a wide class of channels. Furthermore, we systematically identify\nall the exact asymptotic scaling regimes of $D_e$ and the accompanying physical\nmechanisms that control dispersion, clarifying the distinction between smooth\nchannels and compartmentalized ones, and identifying the regimes in which $D_e$\ncan be linked to first passage problems.\n", "  The {\\gamma} Dor pulsating stars present high-order gravity modes, which make\nthem important targets in the intermediate-and low-mass main-sequence region of\nthe Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Whilst we have only access to rotation in the\nenvelope of the Sun, the g modes of {\\gamma} Dor stars can in principle deliver\nus constraints on the inner layers. With the puzzling discovery of unexpectedly\nlow rotation rates in the core of red giants, the {\\gamma} Dor stars appear now\nas unique targets to explore internal angular momentum transport in the\nprogenitors of red giants. Yet, the {\\gamma} Dor pulsations remain hard to\ndetect from the ground for their periods are close to 1 day. While the CoRoT\nspace mission first revealed intriguing frequency spectra, the almost\nuninterrupted 4-year photometry from the Kepler mission eventually shed a new\nlight on them. It revealed regularities in the spectra, expected to bear\nsignature of physical processes, including rotation, in the shear layers close\nto the convective core. We present here the first results of our effort to\nderive exploitable seismic diagnosis for mid- to fast rotators among {\\gamma}\nDor stars. We confirm their potential to explore the rotation history of this\nearly phase of stellar evolution.\n", "  The entanglement between photon pairs generated from the biexciton cascade\ntransition in a semi- conductor quantum dot located in the vicinity of a metal\nnanoparticle is theoretically investigated. In the model scheme, the\nbiexciton-exciton and exciton-ground state transitions are assumed to be\ncoupled to two principal plasmon modes of orthogonal polarizations. For a broad\nspectral window, because the horizontal and vertical spectra are overlapped,\nthe biexciton and exciton photons are degenerate in energy. This allows us to\novercome the natural splitting between the intermediate exciton states.\nMoreover, the degree of entanglement depends on the geometrical parameters of\nthe system. i.e., the radius of the metal nanoparticle and the distance between\nthe quantum dot and the nanoparticle. The results reveal that such a hybrid\nsystem profoundly modifies the photon entanglement even in the absence of\nstrong coupling between the emitter and the metal nanosphere.\n", "  Getting insights into the 3D structure of the solar coronal magnetic field\nhave been done in the past by two completely different approaches: (1.)\nNonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations, which use photospheric\nvector magnetograms as boundary condition. (2.) Stereoscopy of coronal magnetic\nloops observed in EUV coronal images from different vantage points. Both\napproaches have their strength and weaknesses. Extrapolation methods are\nsensitive to noise and inconsistencies in the boundary data and the accuracy of\nstereoscopy is affected by the ability of identifying the same structure in\ndifferent images and by the separation angle between the view directions. As a\nconsequence, for the same observational data, the computed 3D coronal magnetic\nfield with the two methods do not necessarily coincide. In an earlier work\n(Paper I) we extended our NLFFF optimization code by the inclusion of\nstereoscopic constrains. The method was successfully tested with synthetic data\nand within this work we apply the newly developed code to a combined data-set\nfrom SDO/HMI, SDO/AIA and the two STEREO spacecraft. The extended method\n(called S-NLFFF) contains an additional term that monitors and minimizes the\nangle between the local magnetic field direction and the orientation of the 3D\ncoronal loops reconstructed by stereoscopy. We find that prescribing the shape\nof the 3D stereoscopically reconstructed loops the S-NLFFF method leads to a\nmuch better agreement between the modeled field and the stereoscopically\nreconstructed loops. We also find an appreciable decrease by a factor of two in\nthe angle between the current and the magnetic field which indicates the\nimproved quality of the force-free solution obtained by S-NLFFF.\n", "  Plasma panel detectors are a variant of micropattern detectors that are\nsensitive to ionizing radiation. They are motivated by the design and operation\nof plasma display panels. The detectors consist of arrays of electrically and\noptically isolated pixels defined by metallized cavities embedded in a\ndielectric substrate. These are hermetically sealed gaseous detectors that use\nexclusively non-hydrocarbon gas mixtures. The newest variant of these\nclosed-architecture detectors is known as the Microhexcavity plasma panel\ndetector ($\\mu$Hex) consisting of 2 mm wide, regular close-packed hexagonal\npixels each with a circular thick-film anode. The fabrication, staging, and\noperation of these detectors is described. Initial tests with the $\\mu$Hex\ndetectors operated in Geiger mode yield Volt-level signals in the presence of\nionizing radiation. The spontaneous discharge rate in the absence of a source\nis roughly 3-4 orders of magnitude lower compared to the rates measured using\nlow energy betas.\n", "  The radiative process responsible for gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) prompt emission\nhas not been identified yet. If dominated by fast-cooling synchrotron\nradiation, the part of the spectrum immediately below the $\\nu F_\\nu$ peak\nenergy should display a power-law behavior with slope $\\alpha_2=-3/2$, which\nbreaks to a higher value $\\alpha_1=-2/3$ (i.e. to a harder spectral shape) at\nlower energies. Prompt emission spectral data (usually available down to\n$\\sim10-20\\,$keV) are consistent with one single power-law behavior below the\npeak, with typical slope $\\langle\\alpha\\rangle=-1$, higher than (and then\ninconsistent with) the expected value $\\alpha_2=-3/2$. To better characterize\nthe spectral shape at low energy, we analyzed 14 GRBs for which the Swift X-ray\nTelescope started observations during the prompt. When available, Fermi-GBM\nobservations have been included in the analysis. For 67% of the spectra, models\nthat usually give a satisfactory description of the prompt (e.g., the Band\nmodel) fail in reproducing the $0.5-1000\\,$keV spectra: low-energy data outline\nthe presence of a spectral break around a few keV.We then introduce an\nempirical fitting function that includes a low-energy power law $\\alpha_1$, a\nbreak energy $E_{\\rm break}$, a second power law $\\alpha_2$, and a peak energy\n$E_{\\rm peak}$. We find $\\langle\\alpha_1\\rangle=-0.66$ ($ \\rm \\sigma=0.35$),\n$\\langle \\log (E_{\\rm break}/\\rm keV)\\rangle=0.63$ ($ \\rm \\sigma=0.20$),\n$\\langle\\alpha_2\\rangle=-1.46$ ($\\rm \\sigma=0.31$), and $\\langle \\log (E_{\\rm\npeak}/\\rm keV)\\rangle=2.1$ ($ \\rm \\sigma=0.56$).The values\n$\\langle\\alpha_1\\rangle$ and $\\langle\\alpha_2\\rangle$ are very close to\nexpectations from synchrotron radiation. In this context, $E_{\\rm break}$\ncorresponds to the cooling break frequency.\n", "  Nano- and microscale particles, such as colloids, commonly interact over\nranges much shorter than their diameters, so it is natural to treat them as\n\"sticky,\" interacting only when they touch exactly. The lowest-energy states,\nfree energies, and dynamics of a collection of $n$ particles can be calculated\nin the sticky limit of a deep, narrow interaction potential. This article\nsurveys the theory of the sticky limit, explains the correspondence between\ntheory and experiments on colloidal clusters, and outlines areas where the\nsticky limit may bring new insight.\n", "  It is widely established that extreme space weather events associated with\nsolar flares are capable of causing widespread technological damage. We develop\na simple mathematical model to assess the economic losses arising from these\nphenomena over time. We demonstrate that the economic damage is characterized\nby an initial period of power-law growth, followed by exponential amplification\nand eventual saturation. We outline a mitigation strategy to protect our planet\nby setting up a magnetic shield to deflect charged particles at the Lagrange\npoint L$_1$, and demonstrate that this approach appears to be realizable in\nterms of its basic physical parameters. We conclude our analysis by arguing\nthat shielding strategies adopted by advanced civilizations will lead to\ntechnosignatures that are detectable by upcoming missions.\n", "  The Hamiltonian of any quantum cosmological model must obey some conditions\nin order to be self-adjoint, or to admit self-adjoint extensions. We will\nconsider in this paper the self-adjoint character of the Hamiltonian resulting\nfrom the Brans-Dicke theory, both in Einstein and Jordan frames. In both cases\nwe find the wave-function solutions in order to obtain concrete predictions for\nthe evolution of the Universe. We show that the specific cosmological scenarios\nobtained depend very weakly on the conditions of having a self-adjoint\noperator. The problem of equivalence between Einstein and Jordan frames is\nconsidered, and it is shown that this equivalence implies a specific ordering\nparameter, as well as a particular choice of the physical variables.\n", "  We establish the monotonicity of the principal eigenvalue $\\lambda_1(A)$, as\na function of the advection amplitude $A$, for the elliptic operator\n$L_{A}=-\\mathrm{div}(a(x)\\nabla)+A\\mathbf{V}\\cdot\\nabla +c(x)$ with\nincompressible flow $\\mathbf{V}$, subject to Dirichlet, Robin and Neumann\nboundary conditions. As a consequence, the limit of $\\lambda_1(A)$ as $A\\to\n\\infty$ always exists and is finite for Robin boundary conditions. These\nresults answer some open questions raised by [Berestycki, H., Hamel, F.,\nNadirashvili, N.: Elliptic eigenvalue problems with large drift and\napplications to nonlinear propagation phenomena, Commun. Math. Phys. 253,\n451-480 (2005)]. Our method relies upon some functional which is associated\nwith principal eigenfuntions for operator $L_A$ and its adjoint operator. As a\nbyproduct of the approach, a new min-max characterization of $\\lambda_1(A)$ is\ngiven.\n", "  We report results on various techniques which allow to compute the expansion\ninto Legendre (or in general Gegenbauer) polynomials in an efficient way. We\ndescribe in some detail the algebraic/symbolic approach already presented in\nRef.1 and expand on an alternative approach based on a theorem of Schoenberg.\n", "  The energy loss and energy loss straggling widths have been measured in\ntransmission for MeV protons traversing a thin kapton polyimide foil. In a\nprior step, the thickness and non-uniformity of the target foil were carefully\ninvestigated. The overall relative uncertainties in the stopping power and\nenergy loss straggling variance data amount, respectively, to less than 2% and\n8%. The experimental data show to be in excellent agreement with available\nprevious ones and with those compiled in the ICRU-49 report. They are fully\nconsistent with the predictions of Sigmund-Schinner's binary collision theory\nof electronic stopping over the whole proton energy range explored. An average\ndeviation of ~2.5% relative to values calculated by the SRIM-2008 code, likely\ndue to effects of valence electrons involving the , and bonds, is however\nobserved at low proton velocities. The measured energy loss straggling data,\nwhich are unique to our knowledge, are found to be in good agreement with\nvalues derived by the classical Bohr formula for keV but they significantly\nexceed Bohr's collisional energy loss straggling at lower proton velocities\nwhere target electrons can no longer be considered as free. They also show to\nbe consistent with the predictions of the Bethe-Livingston and Sigmund-Schinner\ntheories over the low proton velocity region ( keV). However, they are\nsignificantly overestimated by these theories over the intermediate and high\nproton velocity regions, which may be due to bunching effect by inner shell\nelectrons of the polymer target. Besides, our energy loss straggling data are\nin better overall consistency with the Yang, O'Connor and Wang empirical\nformula for keV, while deviations above the latter amounting up to ~18% are\nobserved at lower proton velocities.\n  Keywords: Swift protons; Kapton polyimide; Stopping power; Energy loss\nstraggling; Binary collision theory.\n", "  We consider sub-gap bands induced in a two-dimensional superconductor by a\ndensely packed chain of magnetic moments with ferromagnetic or spiral\nalignments. We show that crucially all wavelengths must be taken into account\nin the calculation of the sub-gap properties, and that in particular gap\nclosings can occur at high momentum due to a mix of Shiba type and magnetic\nscattering states. The sub-gap bands are always connected to the bulk bands\nsuch that it is impossible to single out a fully one-dimensional subband as\nrequired for distinct topological properties. To obtain the latter a finite\nspacing between the impurities needs to be reintroduced such that by zone\nfolding the bands can disconnect from the continuum.\n", "  We discuss the ground-breaking science that will be possible with a wide area\nsurvey, using the MeerKAT telescope, known as MeerKLASS (MeerKAT Large Area\nSynoptic Survey). The current specifications of MeerKAT make it a great fit for\nscience applications that require large survey speeds but not necessarily high\nangular resolutions. In particular, for cosmology, a large survey over $\\sim\n4,000 \\, {\\rm deg}^2$ for $\\sim 4,000$ hours will potentially provide the first\never measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations using the 21cm intensity\nmapping technique, with enough accuracy to impose constraints on the nature of\ndark energy. The combination with multi-wavelength data will give unique\nadditional information, such as exquisite constraints on primordial\nnon-Gaussianity using the multi-tracer technique, as well as a better handle on\nforegrounds and systematics. Such a wide survey with MeerKAT is also a great\nmatch for HI galaxy studies, providing unrivalled statistics in the pre-SKA era\nfor galaxies resolved in the HI emission line beyond local structures at z >\n0.01. It will also produce a large continuum galaxy sample down to a depth of\nabout 5\\,$\\mu$Jy in L-band, which is quite unique over such large areas and\nwill allow studies of the large-scale structure of the Universe out to high\nredshifts, complementing the galaxy HI survey to form a transformational\nmulti-wavelength approach to study galaxy dynamics and evolution. Finally, the\nsame survey will supply unique information for a range of other science\napplications, including a large statistical investigation of galaxy clusters as\nwell as produce a rotation measure map across a huge swathe of the sky. The\nMeerKLASS survey will be a crucial step on the road to using SKA1-MID for\ncosmological applications and other commensal surveys, as described in the top\npriority SKA key science projects (abridged).\n", "  Recently acquired WFC3 UV (F275W and F336W) imaging mosaics under the Legacy\nExtragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) combined with archival ACS data of M51 are used\nto study the young star cluster (YSC) population of this interacting system.\nOur newly extracted source catalogue contains 2834 cluster candidates,\nmorphologically classified to be compact and uniform in colour, for which ages,\nmasses and extinction are derived. In this first work we study the main\nproperties of the YSC population of the whole galaxy, considering a\nmass-limited sample. Both luminosity and mass functions follow a power law\nshape with slope -2, but at high luminosities and masses a dearth of sources is\nobserved. The analysis of the mass function suggests that it is best fitted by\na Schechter function with slope -2 and a truncation mass at\n$1.00\\pm0.12\\times10^5\\ M_\\odot$. Through Monte Carlo simulations we confirm\nthis result and link the shape of the luminosity function to the presence of a\ntruncation in the mass function. A mass limited age function analysis, between\n10 and 200 Myr, suggests that the cluster population is undergoing only\nmoderate disruption. We observe little variation in the shape of the mass\nfunction at masses above $1\\times10^4\\ M_\\odot$, over this age range. The\nfraction of star formation happening in the form of bound clusters in M51 is\n$\\sim20\\%$ in the age range 10 to 100 Myr and little variation is observed over\nthe whole range from 1 to 200 Myr.\n", "  The Large Ultraviolet / Optical / Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) is one of four\nlarge mission concepts currently undergoing community study for consideration\nby the 2020 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The LUVOIR Ultraviolet\nMulti-Object Spectrograph, LUMOS, is being designed to support all of the UV\nscience requirements of LUVOIR, from exoplanet host star characterization to\ntomography of circumgalactic halos to water plumes on outer solar system\nsatellites. LUMOS offers point source and multi-object spectroscopy across the\nUV bandpass, with multiple resolution modes to support different science goals.\nThe instrument will provide low (R = 8,000-18,000) and medium (R =\n30,000-65,000) resolution modes across the far-ultraviolet (FUV: 100-200 nm)\nand near-ultraviolet (NUV: 200-400 nm) windows, and a very low resolution mode\n(R = 500) for spectroscopic investigations of extremely faint objects in the\nFUV. Imaging spectroscopy will be accomplished over a 3 x 1.6 arcminute\nfield-of-view by employing holographically-ruled diffraction gratings to\ncontrol optical aberrations, microshutter arrays (MSA), advanced optical\ncoatings for high-throughput in the FUV, and next generation large-format\nphoton-counting detectors. The spectroscopic capabilities of LUMOS are\naugmented by an FUV imaging channel (100-200nm, 13 milliarcsecond angular\nresolution, 2 x 2 arcminute field-of-view) that will employ a complement of\nnarrow and medium-band filters. We present an overview of LUMOS' observing\nmodes and estimated performance curves for effective area, spectral resolution,\nand imaging performance. Example \"LUMOS 100-hour Highlights\" observing programs\nare presented to demonstrate the potential power of LUVOIR's ultraviolet\nspectroscopic capabilities.\n", "  Vascular plants rely on differences of osmotic pressure to export sugars from\nregions of synthesis (mature leaves) to sugar sinks (roots, fruits). In this\nprocess, known as M\\\"unch pressure flow, the loading of sugars from\nphotosynthetic cells to the export conduit (the phloem) is crucial, as it sets\nthe pressure head necessary to power long-distance transport. Whereas most\nherbaceous plants use active mechanisms to increase phloem concentration above\nthat of the photosynthetic cells, in most tree species, for which transport\ndistances are largest, loading seems to occur via passive symplastic diffusion\nfrom the mesophyll to the phloem. Here, we use a synthetic microfluidic model\nof a passive loader to explore the nonlinear dynamics that arise during export\nand determine the ability of passive loading to drive long-distance transport.\nWe first demonstrate that in our device, phloem concentration is set by the\nbalance between the resistances to diffusive loading from the source and\nconvective export through the phloem. Convection-limited export corresponds to\nclassical models of M\\\"unch transport, where phloem concentration is close to\nthat of the source; in contrast, diffusion-limited export leads to small phloem\nconcentrations and weak scaling of flow rates with the hydraulic resistance. We\nthen show that the effective regime of convection-limited export is predominant\nin plants with large transport resistances and low xylem pressures. Moreover,\nhydrostatic pressures developed in our synthetic passive loader can reach\nbotanically relevant values as high as 10 bars. We conclude that passive\nloading is sufficient to drive long-distance transport in large plants, and\nthat trees are well suited to take full advantage of passive phloem loading\nstrategies.\n", "  We report a comprehensive $^{139}$La and $^{63}$Cu nuclear magnetic resonance\nstudy on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ ($0.07\\leq x \\leq 0.2$) single crystals. The\n$^{139}$La spin-lattice relaxation rate $^{139}T_1^{-1}$ is drastically\ninfluenced by Sr doping $x$ at low temperatures. A detailed field dependence of\n$^{139}T_1^{-1}$ at $x=1/8$ suggests that charge ordering induces the critical\nslowing down of spin fluctuations toward glassy spin order and competes with\nsuperconductivity. On the other hand, the $^{63}$Cu relaxation rate\n$^{63}T_1^{-1}$ is well described by a Curie-Weiss law at high temperatures,\nyielding the Curie-Weiss temperature $\\Theta$ as a function of doping. $\\Theta$\nchanges sharply through a critical hole concentration $x_c\\sim 0.09$. $x_c$\nappears to correspond to the delocalization limit of doped holes, above which\nthe bulk nature of superconductivity is established.\n", "  We present development of a genetic algorithm for fitting potential energy\ncurves of diatomic molecules to experimental data. Our approach does not\ninvolve any functional form for fitting, which makes it a general fitting\nprocedure. In particular, it takes in a guess potential, perhaps from an $ab \\\ninitio$ calculation, along with experimental measurements of vibrational\nbinding energies, rotational constants, and their experimental uncertainties.\nThe fitting procedure is able to modify the guess potential until it converges\nto better than 1% uncertainty, as measured by $\\bar{\\chi}^2$. We present the\ndetails of this technique along with a comparison of potentials calculated by\nour genetic algorithm and the state of the art fitting techniques based on\ninverted perturbation approach for the $X \\ ^1\\Sigma^+$ and $C \\ ^1\\Sigma^+$\npotentials of lithium-rubidium.\n", "  We present a construction of a 2-Hilbert space of sections of a bundle gerbe,\na suitable candidate for a prequantum 2-Hilbert space in higher geometric\nquantisation. We introduce a direct sum on the morphism categories in the\n2-category of bundle gerbes and show that these categories are cartesian\nmonoidal and abelian. Endomorphisms of the trivial bundle gerbe, or higher\nfunctions, carry the structure of a rig-category, which acts on generic\nmorphism categories of bundle gerbes. We continue by presenting a\ncategorification of the hermitean metric on a hermitean line bundle. This is\nachieved by introducing a functorial dual that extends the dual of vector\nbundles to morphisms of bundle gerbes, and constructing a two-variable\nadjunction for the aforementioned rig-module category structure on morphism\ncategories. Its right internal hom is the module action, composed by taking the\ndual of higher functions, while the left internal hom is interpreted as a\nbundle gerbe metric. Sections of bundle gerbes are defined as morphisms from\nthe trivial bundle gerbe to a given bundle gerbe. The resulting categories of\nsections carry a rig-module structure over the category of finite-dimensional\nHilbert spaces. A suitable definition of 2-Hilbert spaces is given, modifying\nprevious definitions by the use of two-variable adjunctions. We prove that the\ncategory of sections of a bundle gerbe fits into this framework, thus obtaining\na 2-Hilbert space of sections. In particular, this can be constructed for\nprequantum bundle gerbes in problems of higher geometric quantisation. We\ndefine a dimensional reduction functor and show that the categorical structures\nintroduced on bundle gerbes naturally reduce to their counterparts on hermitean\nline bundles with connections. In several places in this thesis, we provide\nexamples, making 2-Hilbert spaces of sections and dimensional reduction very\nexplicit.\n", "  A beam imaging detector was developed by coupling a multi-strip anode with\ndelay line readout to an E$\\times$B microchannel plate (MCP) detector. This\ndetector is capable of measuring the incident position of the beam particles in\none-dimension. To assess the spatial resolution, the detector was illuminated\nby an $\\alpha$-source with an intervening mask that consists of a series of\nprecisely-machined slits. The measured spatial resolution was 520$\\mu$m FWHM,\nwhich was improved to 413$\\mu$m FWHM by performing an FFT of the signals,\nrejecting spurious signals on the delay line, and requiring a minimum signal\namplitude. This measured spatial resolution of 413$\\mu$m FWHM corresponds to an\nintrinsic resolution of 334$\\mu$m FWHM when the effect of the finite slit width\nis de-convoluted. To understand the measured resolution, the performance of the\ndetector is simulated with the ion-trajectory code SIMION.\n", "  The X-ray emission spectrum of liquid ethanol was calculated using density\nfunctional theory and a semi-classical approximation to the Kramers-Heisenberg\nformula including core-hole-induced dynamics. Our spectrum agrees well with the\nexperimental spectrum. We found that the intensity ratio between the two peaks\nat 526 and 527 eV assigned as 10a' and 3a\" depends not only on the hydrogen\nbonding network around the target molecule, but also on the intramolecular\nconformation. This effect is absent in liquid methanol and demonstrates the\nhigh sensitivity of X-ray emission to molecular structure. The dependence of\nspectral features on hydrogen-bonding as well as on dynamical effects following\ncore-excitation are also discussed.\n", "  Two-qubit quantum codes have been suggested to obtain better efficiency and\nhigher loss tolerance in quantum key distribution. Here, we propose a two-qubit\nquantum key distribution protocol based on a mixed basis consisting of two Bell\nstates and two states from the computational basis. All states can be generated\nfrom a single entangled photon pair resource by using local operations on only\none auxiliary photon. Compared to other schemes it is also possible to\ndeterministically discriminate all states using linear optics. Additionally,\nour protocol can be implemented with today's technology. When discussing the\nsecurity of our protocol we find a much improved resistance against certain\nattacks as compared to the standard BB84 protocol.\n", "  This paper is about the fractional Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (FSE) expressed\nin terms of the quantum Riesz-Feller space fractional and the Caputo time\nfractional derivatives. The main focus is on the case of time independent\npotential fields as a Dirac-delta potential and a linear potential. For such\ntype of potential fields the separation of variables method allows to split the\nFSE into space fractional equation and time fractional one. The results\nobtained in this paper contain as particular cases already known results for\nFSE in terms of the quantum Riesz space fractional derivative and standard\nLaplace operator.\n", "  Chromatic polynomials and related graph invariants are central objects in\nboth graph theory and statistical physics. Computational difficulties, however,\nhave so far restricted studies of such polynomials to graphs that were either\nvery small, very sparse or highly structured. Recent algorithmic advances\n(Timme et al 2009 New J. Phys. 11 023001) now make it possible to compute\nchromatic polynomials for moderately sized graphs of arbitrary structure and\nnumber of edges. Here we present chromatic polynomials of ensembles of random\ngraphs with up to 30 vertices, over the entire range of edge density. We\nspecifically focus on the locations of the zeros of the polynomial in the\ncomplex plane. The results indicate that the chromatic zeros of random graphs\nhave a very consistent layout. In particular, the crossing point, the point at\nwhich the chromatic zeros with non-zero imaginary part approach the real axis,\nscales linearly with the average degree over most of the density range. While\nthe scaling laws obtained are purely empirical, if they continue to hold in\ngeneral there are significant implications: the crossing points of chromatic\nzeros in the thermodynamic limit separate systems with zero ground state\nentropy from systems with positive ground state entropy, the latter an\nexception to the third law of thermodynamics.\n", "  In order to build a large scale quantum computer, one must be able to correct\nerrors extremely fast. We design a fast decoding algorithm for topological\ncodes to correct for Pauli errors and erasure and combination of both errors\nand erasure. Our algorithm has a worst case complexity of $O(n \\alpha(n))$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of physical qubits and $\\alpha$ is the inverse of\nAckermann's function, which is very slowly growing. For all practical purposes,\n$\\alpha(n) \\leq 3$. We prove that our algorithm performs optimally for errors\nof weight up to $(d-1)/2$ and for loss of up to $d-1$ qubits, where $d$ is the\nminimum distance of the code. Numerically, we obtain a threshold of $9.9\\%$ for\nthe 2d-toric code with perfect syndrome measurements and $2.6\\%$ with faulty\nmeasurements.\n", "  SpectraPlot is a web-based application for simulating spectra of atomic and\nmolecular gases. At the time this manuscript was written, SpectraPlot consisted\nof four primary tools for calculating: 1) atomic and molecular absorption\nspectra, 2) atomic and molecular emission spectra, 3) transition linestrengths,\nand 4) blackbody emission spectra. These tools currently employ the NIST ASD,\nHITRAN2012, and HITEMP2010 databases to perform line-by-line simulations of\nspectra. SpectraPlot employs a modular, integrated architecture, enabling\nmultiple simulations across multiple databases and/or thermodynamic conditions\nto be visualized in a single interactive plot window. The primary objective of\nthis paper is to describe the architecture and spectroscopic models employed by\nSpectraPlot in order to provide its users with the knowledge required to\nunderstand the capabilities and limitations of simulations performed using\nSpectraPlot. Further, this manuscript discusses the accuracy of several\nunderlying approximations used to decrease computational time, namely, the use\nof far-wing cutoff criteria.\n", "  We show that an electrically soft ferroelectric host can be used to tune the\nphotoluminescence (PL) response of rare-earth emitter ions by external electric\nfield. The proof of this concept is demonstrated by changing the PL response of\nEu+3 ion by electric field on a model system Eu-doped\n0.94Na1/2Bi1/2TiO3-0.06BaTiO3. We also show that new channels of radiative\ntransitions, forbidden otherwise, open up due to positional disorder in the\nsystem, which can as well be tuned by electric field.\n", "  We present the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) Large Array catalogue of\n139 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). AMI observes at a central frequency of 15.7 GHz\nand is equipped with a fully automated rapid-response mode, which enables the\ntelescope to respond to high-energy transients detected by Swift. On receiving\na transient alert, AMI can be on-target within two minutes, scheduling later\nstart times if the source is below the horizon. Further AMI observations are\nmanually scheduled for several days following the trigger. The AMI GRB\nprogramme probes the early-time (< 1 day) radio properties of GRBs, and has\nobtained some of the earliest radio detections (GRB 130427A at 0.36 and GRB\n130907A at 0.51 days post-burst). As all Swift GRBs visible to AMI are\nobserved, this catalogue provides the first representative sample of GRB radio\nproperties, unbiased by multi-wavelength selection criteria. We report the\ndetection of six GRB radio afterglows that were not previously detected by\nother radio telescopes, increasing the rate of radio detections by 50% over an\n18-month period. The AMI catalogue implies a Swift GRB radio detection rate of\n>15%, down to ~0.2 mJy/beam. However, scaling this by the fraction of GRBs AMI\nwould have detected in the Chandra & Frail sample (all radio-observed GRBs\nbetween 1997 - 2011), it is possible ~44 - 56% of Swift GRBs are radio-bright,\ndown to ~0.1 - 0.15 mJy/beam. This increase from the Chandra & Frail rate\n(~30%) is likely due to the AMI rapid-response mode, which allows observations\nto begin while the reverse-shock is contributing to the radio afterglow.\n", "  Composition dependent Rayleigh and structural analysis was carried out on the\nlead-free piezoceramics (1-x)(BaTi0.88Sn0.12)-x(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 at room\ntemperature. The system exhibits tetragonal (P4mm) structure for x > 0.21,\nrhombohedral (R3m) for x < 0.13 and orthorhombic (Amm2) for 0.13<x<0.21.\nRayleigh analysis suggests that the irreversible contribution to the dielectric\nresponse is enhanced in the single phase orthorhombic compositions in the\nvicinity of the R3m-Amm2 and Amm2-P4mm phase boundaries, and not in\ncompositions exhibiting phase coexistences (x = 0.12 and 0.22). We also found a\ncorrespondence between the irreversible Rayleigh parameter and the coercive\nfield in this system.\n", "  The electronic structures of UX$_3$ (X=Al, Ga, and In) were studied by\nphotoelectron spectroscopy to understand the relationship between their\nelectronic structures and magnetic properties. The band structures and Fermi\nsurfaces of UAl$_3$ and UGa$_3$ were revealed experimentally by angle-resolved\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), and they were compared with the result of\nband-structure calculations. The topologies of the Fermi surfaces and the band\nstructures of UAl$_3$ and UGa$_3$ were explained reasonably well by the\ncalculation, although bands near the Fermi level ($E_\\mathrm{F}$) were\nrenormalized owing to the finite electron correlation effect. The topologies of\nthe Fermi surfaces of UAl$_3$ and UGa$_3$ are very similar to each other,\nexcept for some minor differences. Such minor differences in their Fermi\nsurface or electron correlation effect might take an essential role in their\ndifferent magnetic properties. No significant changes were observed between the\nARPES spectra of UGa$_3$ in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases,\nsuggesting that UGa$_3$ is an itinerant weak antiferromagnet. The effect of\nchemical pressure on the electronic structures of UX$_3$ compounds was also\nstudied by utilizing the smaller lattice constants of UAl$_3$ and UGa$_3$ than\nthat of UIn$_3$. The valence band spectrum of UIn$_3$ is accompanied by a\nsatellite-like structure on the high-binding-energy side. The core-level\nspectrum of UIn$_3$ is also qualitatively different from those of UAl$_3$ and\nUGa$_3$. These findings suggest that the U~$5f$ states in UIn$_3$ are more\nlocalized than those in UAl$_3$ and UGa$_3$.\n", "  The potential of the Dense Plasma Focus (DPF) for industrial applications in\nmany fields is well recognized, although yet to be realized in practice.\nParticularly attractive is the possibility of its use as inexpensive industrial\nsource of nuclear reactions for diverse high value applications such as fast\npulsed neutron radiography of hydrogenous materials, non-intrusive neutron\ninterrogation of concealed organic contraband and rapid production of short\nlived radioisotopes for medical diagnostics and therapy. Recently, it has been\nsuggested that it may be possible to operate the DPF efficiently in a\nHigh-Pressure-Optimized (HPO) mode. This paper explores the design parameter\nspace for such HPO-DPF based on the revised Resistive Gratton-Vargas (RGV)\nmodel with a view to identify a practicable set of system parameters and their\nscaling. The current waveform predicted by the revised RGV model for the chosen\nset of parameters is fitted to the Lee model to estimate the likely neutron\nyield.\n", "  We consider the use of a Kinetic Monte Carlo approach for the description of\nnon-equilibrium bosonic systems, taking non-resonantly excited\nexciton-polariton condensates and bosonic cascade lasers as examples. In the\nformer case, the considered approach allows the study of the cross-over between\nincoherent and coherent regimes, which represents the formation of a\nquasi-condensate that forms purely from the action of energy relaxation\nprocesses rather than interactions between the condensing particles themselves.\nIn the latter case, we show that a bosonic cascade can theoretically develop an\noutput coherent state.\n", "  One of the biggest challenges in implementation of Quantum circuits or\nPhotonic Integrated Circuits in general is the inability to create efficient\nrelay devices due to small decoherence time, high delays and poor\ninterconnections that worsen the decoherence and delay problems. A feasible\nrelay device design is proposed that can work in conjunction with various\nsources, be highly tunable over a reasonably large bandwidth and operate with\nnegligible switching delays. This is achieved with the help of the Transition\nMetal Dichalcogenide MoSe2 WSe2 heterojunction and a modulating chirped\nstrain/acoustic wave is applied to control the operating frequency and other\noperational characteristics of the device. The chirping of strain wave is meant\nto control the exciton transport across the device. The switching delay is\nproposed to reduce by exploiting the exciton dynamics so that the carrier\nnon-equilibrium is never disturbed and therefore no delay occurs while\nswitching on or off. MoSe2 WSe2 heterojunction is chosen because of their\nbinding energy nearly two orders greater than GaAs quantum wells because of\nwhich they demonstrate high exciton response which is electrically tunable even\nat room temperature. Also, it is possible to grow TMDC films on Si based\nsubstrates using particular techniques so that their properties are intact.\nSuch a device can find applications in wide range of components in quantum\noptoelectronic integrated circuits such as switches, logic gates, sensors and\nbuffers.\n", "  We theoretically study resonance responses of flat surfaces and sharp edges\nof the nanostructures that support excitations of phonon-polaritons in\nmid-infrared range. We focus on two materials: silicon carbide that has a\nnearly isotropic permittivity and hexagonal boron nitride that has a strong\nanisotropy and spectral band with hyperbolic dispersion. We aim to predict\nscattering-type near-field optical microscope (s-SNOM) response and develop a\nmodeling approach that adequately describes the resonant behavior of the\nnanostructure with phonon-polaritons. The previously employed technique assumes\ndipole scattering from the tip and allows calculating s-SNOM signal in\ndifferent demodulation orders by modeling full structure, any tip positions,\nand vertical scans, which works well for the structures with only one hot spot,\ne.g. flat surfaces. In the structures of complex shapes, hot-spot places are\nunknown, and analysis of light absorption in the whole apex is the best way to\naccount for all hot spots and field enhancement. We show that calculation of\ndemodulation orders of light absorption in the tip is an alternative way to\npredict s-SNOM signal, and it is preferred for the structures of complex shapes\nwith strong resonances, where dipole approximation of the tip is not valid.\n", "  Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules were investigated on the topological\ninsulator surface Bi2Se3 using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and\nspectroscopy (STS) at 77 K in ultra high vacuum (UHV). Sub-molecular resolution\nSTM images provide the atomic scale registry of the adsorption site of the\nmolecules, on-top or bridge, with reference to the top surface Se atoms of the\nBi2Se3 surface. STS data reveal a slight shift in the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of\nthe FePc molecules with respect to the specific binding site. Close to Fermi\nenergy the STS measurements show that the Dirac point of Bi2Se3 remains\nunchanged after depositing FePc molecules. This is indicative of the protection\nof the topological insulator surface state (TISS). We speculate that though the\nFe atom has magnetic properties, the ligands attached to Fe in the Pc ring\ninfluence the magnetic behavior of the molecule upon adsorption on the Bi2Se3\nsubstrate. Our work puts forth an example to advance the strategic platform for\ntuning the TISS interfaces with different molecules and for designing surfaces\nand interfaces with time reversal symmetry protected magnetic textures.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the possibility of achieving a superconducting\nstate in transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers through intercalation, a\nprocess previously and widely used to achieve metallization and superconducting\nstates in novel superconductors. For the Ca-intercalated bilayers MoS$_2$ and\nWS$_2$, we find that the superconducting state is characterized by an\nelectron-phonon coupling constant larger than $1.0$ and a superconducting\ncritical temperature of $13.3$ and $9.3$ K, respectively. These results are\nsuperior to other predicted or experimentally observed two-dimensional\nconventional superconductors and suggest that the investigated materials may be\ngood candidates for nanoscale superconductors. More interestingly, we proved\nthat the obtained thermodynamic properties go beyond the predictions of the\nmean-field Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer approximation and that the calculations\nconducted within the framework of the strong-coupling Eliashberg theory should\nbe treated as those that yield quantitative results.\n", "  This work presents the application of Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation\nAnalysis for the surface electromyography signals obtained from the patients\nsuffering from rectal cancer. The electrical activity of an external anal\nsphincter at different levels of medical treatment is considered. The results\nfrom standard MFDFA and the EMD--based MFDFA method are compared. Two distinct\nscaling regions were identified. Within the region of short time scales the\ncalculated spectra exhibit the shift towards higher values of the singularity\nexponent for both methods. In addition obtained spectra are shifted towards the\nlower values of singularity exponent for the EMD--based MFDFA.\n", "  Recent studies of the fluctuations of an open string in AdS space show some\npieces of evidence that the string with a worldsheet horizon could be a dual\ndescription of SYK model, as they saturate universal chaos bound and share the\nsame symmetry. An open string hangs from the AdS boundary to the horizon of\nblack brane could be dual to a 0+1 dimensional boundary state. To be specific,\nwe find that the fluctuation of the string in charged BTZ black hole has an\nasymptotic scaling symmetry, and its Euclidean IR fixed point is governed by\nthe quadratic order of Schwarzian action, which is just the low energy\neffective theory of the SYK model. Considering the open string worldsheet also\nhas natural reparametrization symmetry, we conjecture that the action of the\nstring worldsheet is a dual description of SYK state.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is an international project for a\nnext-generation ground-based gamma ray observatory, aiming to improve on the\nsensitivity of current-generation experiments by an order of magnitude and\nprovide energy coverage from 30 GeV to more than 300 TeV. The 9.7m\nSchwarzschild-Couder (SC) candidate medium-size telescope for CTA exploits a\nnovel aplanatic two-mirror optical design that provides a large field of view\nof 8 degrees and substantially improves the off-axis performance giving better\nangular resolution across all of the field of view with respect to\nsingle-mirror telescopes. The realization of the SC optical design implies the\nchallenging production of large aspherical mirrors accompanied by a\nsubmillimeter-precision custom alignment system. In this contribution we report\non the status of the implementation of the optical system on a prototype 9.7 m\nSC telescope located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern\nArizona.\n", "  We present a new method for replacing the outermost layers of stellar models\nwith interpolated atmospheres based on results from 3D simulations, in order to\ncorrect for structural inadequacies of these layers. This replacement is known\nas patching. Tests, based on 3D atmospheres from three different codes and\ninterior models with different input physics, are performed. Using solar\nmodels, we investigate how different patching criteria affect the\neigenfrequencies. These criteria include the depth, at which the replacement is\nperformed, the quantity, on which the replacement is based, and the mismatch in\n$T_\\mathrm{eff}$ and $\\log g$ between the un-patched model and patched 3D\natmosphere. We find the eigenfrequencies to be unaltered by the patching depth\ndeep within the adiabatic region, while changing the patching quantity or the\nemployed atmosphere grid leads to frequency shifts that may exceed\n$1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{Hz}$. Likewise, the eigenfrequencies are sensitive to mismatches\nin $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ or $\\log g$. A thorough investigation of the accuracy of a\nnew scheme, for interpolating mean 3D stratifications within the atmosphere\ngrids, is furthermore performed. Throughout large parts of the atmosphere\ngrids, our interpolation scheme yields sufficiently accurate results for the\npurpose of asteroseismology. We apply our procedure in asteroseismic analyses\nof four \\textit{Kepler} stars and draw the same conclusions as in the solar\ncase: Correcting for structural deficiencies lowers the eigenfrequencies, this\ncorrection is slightly sensitive to the patching criteria, and the remaining\nfrequency discrepancy between models and observations is less\nfrequency-dependent. Our work shows the applicability and relevance of patching\nin asteroseismology.\n", "  The interaction of micro- and nano-structured target surfaces with high-power\nlaser pulses is being widely investigated for its unprecedented absorption\nefficiency. We have developed vertically aligned metallic micro-pillar arrays\nfor laser-driven proton acceleration experiments. We demonstrate that such\ntargets help strengthen interaction mechanisms when irradiated with\nhigh-energy-class laser pulses of intensities $\\sim$ $10^{17-18}$ W/cm$^2$. In\ncomparison with standard planar targets, we witness strongly enhanced\nhot-electron production and proton acceleration both in terms of maximum\nenergies and particle numbers. Supporting our experimental results,\ntwo-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show an increase in laser energy\nconversion into hot electrons, leading to stronger acceleration fields. This\nopens a window of opportunity for further improvements of laser-driven ion\nacceleration systems.\n", "  Let -Delta+V be the Schrodinger operator acting on L^2(R^d,C) with d odd\nlarger than 2. Here V is a bounded real- or complex-valued function vanishing\noutside the closed ball of center 0 and radius a. If V belongs to the class of\npotentials introduced by Christiansen, we show that when r goes to infinity,\nthe resonances of -Delta+V, scaled down by the factor r, are asymptotically\ndistributed, with respect to an explicit probability distribution on the closed\nlower unit half-disc of the complex plane. The rate of convergence is also\nconsidered for subclasses of potentials.\n", "  Non-uniform current distributions of spin valves with disk shaped free layers\nare investigated. In the context of spin valves, the vortex state, which is the\nground-state in many disk shaped magnetic bodies, allows for distinct parallel\nchannels of high and low resistivity. The readout current is thus able to evade\nhigh resistivity regions in favor of low resistivity regions, giving rise to\n'conductive inhomogeneities'. Therefore, the total resistance of the spin valve\ndoes not always correspond exactly to the total average magnetization of the\nfree layer. In addition, the resistance transfer function can be significantly\ninfluenced by the spatial placement of the electrodes, giving rise to\n'geometric inhomogeneities'. The resulting deviations from resistance to\nmagnetization transfer function are investigated for different spin valve\ngeometries and compared to measurements of comparable devices.\n", "  This work presents an experimental study of Single Input Multiple Output\n(SIMO) channel performance in indoor radio propagation environment. Indoor\nchannel measurements at 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band have been performed using a\nversatile channel sounder testbed platform. A single transmitting antenna, four\nreceiving antennas with two proposed geometries and a four-branch receiver\ncircuitry were used in order to achieve channel sounder measurements exploiting\nbaseband signal processing techniques. Deep investigation on SIMO wireless\nchannel performance was realized through three types of metrics which are\nsignal strength, gain coefficient and capacity. Performance results indicate\nSIMO channel capacity enhancement and illustrate differences between the two\nproposed geometries.\n", "  Index of H.E.S.S. conference proceedings to the 35th ICRC, Busan, Korea\n", "  We study the dynamical regimes of a density-stratified fluid confined between\nisothermal no-slip top and bottom boundaries (at temperatures $T_t$ and $T_b$)\nvia direct numerical simulation. The thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid\nis temperature dependent and chosen such that the fluid density is maximum at\nthe inversion temperature $T_b>T_i>T_t$. Thus, the lower layer of the fluid is\nconvectively unstable while the upper layer is stably stratified. We show that\nthe characteristics of the convection change significantly depending on the\ndegree of stratification of the stable layer. For strong stable stratification,\nthe convection zone coincides with the fraction of the fluid that is\nconvectively unstable (i.e. where $T>T_i$), and convective motions consist of\nrising and sinking plumes of large density anomaly, as is the case in canonical\nRayleigh-Benard convection; internal gravity waves are generated by turbulent\nfluctuations in the convective layer and propagate in the upper layer. For weak\nstable stratification, we demonstrate that a large fraction of the stable fluid\n(i.e. with temperature $T<T_i$) is instead destabilized and entrained by\nbuoyant plumes emitted from the bottom boundary. The convection thus mixes cold\npatches of low density-anomaly fluid with hot upward plumes, and the end result\nis that the $T_i$ isotherm sinks within the bottom boundary layer and that the\nconvection is entrainment-dominated. We provide a phenomenological description\nof the transition between the regimes of plume-dominated and\nentrainment-dominated convection through analysis of quantities for different\nstratification strengths. We find that the effect of the stable layer on the\nconvection decreases only weakly with increasing stratification strength,\nmeaning that the dynamics of the stable layer and convection should be studied\nself-consistently in a wide range of applications.\n", "  This paper describes the wet-chemistry synthesis of highly crystalline\nhexagonal flakes of Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) produced at\ntemperature as low as 100 oC. The flakes with diameter in the range of 0.5-1.5\num and the thickness between 15 and 20 nm were obtained by homogeneous\nprecipitation method with the use of triethanolamine (TEA) and urea. By\nanalyzing the intermediate products, it is suggested that, differently from\nprevious reports, a thermodynamically metastable iron oxyhydroxide and Ni-TEA\ncomplex are firstly formed at room temperature. Subsequently, when the mixture\nis heated to 100 oC and the pH increases due to the thermal decomposition of\nurea, Ni2+ and Fe3+ are slowly released and then recombine, thus leading to\nformation of pure, highly-crystalline Ni-Fe LDH flakes. This material showed\npromising results as an electrocatalyst in oxygen evolution reaction (OER)\nproviding an overpotential value of 0.36 V.\n", "  We discuss several conditions for four points to lie on a plane, and we use\nthem to find new equations for four-body central configurations that use angles\nas variables. We use these equations to give novel proofs of some results for\nfour-body central configuration. We also give a clear geometrical explanation\nof why Ptolemy's theorem can be used to write equations for co-circular central\nconfigurations when mutual distances are used as coordinates.\n", "  It is difficult to neutrally evaluate the risks posed by large-scale\nleading-edge science experiments. Traditional risk assessment is problematic in\nthis context for multiple reasons. Also, such experiments can be insulated from\nchallenge by manipulating how questions of risk are framed. Yet courts can and\nmust evaluate these risks. In this chapter, I suggest modes of qualitative\nreasoning to facilitate such evaluation.\n", "  Ab initio calculations shown that the Co substitution instead of Ni in\nNi$_{2}$MnGe with the L2$_{1}$ crystallographic structure leads to a decrease\nof the lattice constant and an increase of the total magnetic moment of the\nNi$_{2-x}$Co$_{x}$MnGe compounds. The Mn(B) has the largest local moment above\n$3~\\mu_{B}$ coupled parallel to moments on the Ni(A,C) and Co(A,C), which are\nfound in the ranges of $0.19\\div0.26~\\mu_{B}$ for Ni(A,C) and\n$1.03\\div0.97~\\mu_{B}$ for Co(A,C) for studied range of $x$. Using the results\nstemming from the total energy calculations, the values of bulk modulus and its\npressure derivatives are estimated according to the Murnaghan EOS.\n", "  Based on CO(2-1) public data, we study the monoxide oxygen gas excitation\nconditions and the magnetic field strength of four spiral galaxies. For the\ngalaxy outskirts, we found kinetic temperatures in the range of\n$\\lesssim$35--38 K, CO column densities $\\lesssim 10^{15}$--$10^{16}$\ncm$^{-2}$, and H$_2$ masses $\\lesssim 4\\times 10^6$--$6\\times10^8$ M$_\\odot$.\nAn H$_2$ density $\\lesssim 10^3$ cm$^{-3}$ is suitable to explain the 2$\\sigma$\nupper limits of the CO(2-1) line intensity. We constrain the magnetic field\nstrength for our sample of spiral galaxies and their outskirts by using their\nmasses and H$_2$ densities to evaluate a simplified magneto-hydrodynamic\nequation. Our estimations provide values for the magnetic field strength on the\norder of $\\lesssim$6--31 {$\\upmu$G}.\n", "  In recent years, space-born experiments have delivered new measurements of\nhigh energy cosmic-ray (CR) $\\bar p$ and $e^+$. In addition, unprecedented\nsensitivity to CR composite anti-nuclei anti-d and anti-He is expected to be\nachieved in the near future. We report on the theoretical interpretation of\nthese measurements. While CR antimatter is a promising discovery tool for new\nphysics or exotic astrophysical phenomena, an irreducible background arises\nfrom secondary production by primary CR collisions with interstellar matter.\nUnderstanding this irreducible background or constraining it from first\nprinciples is an interesting challenge. We review the attempt to obtain such\nunderstanding and apply it to CR $\\bar p,\\, e^+,$ anti-d and anti-He. Based on\nstate of the art Galactic cosmic ray measurements, dominated currently by the\nAMS-02 experiment, we show that: (i) CR $\\bar p$ most likely come from CR-gas\ncollisions; (ii) $e^+$ data is consistent with, and suggestive of the same\nsecondary astrophysical production mechanism responsible for $\\bar p$ and\ndominated by proton-proton collisions. In addition, based on recent accelerator\nanalyses we show that the flux of secondary high energy anti-He may be\nobservable with a few years exposure of AMS-02. We highlight key open\nquestions, as well as the role played by recent and upcoming space and\naccelerator data in clarifying the origins of CR antimatter.\n", "  We use observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) 21-cm emission line\nto study the spatial distribution of the HI gas in a\n80$\\degree\\times~$90$\\degree$ region of the Galaxy halo. The HI column\ndensities in the range of \\mbox{3--11$\\times$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$} have been\nestimated for some of the studied regions. In our map---obtained with a\nspectral sensitivity of $\\sim$2 K---we do not detect any HI 21-cm emission line\n{above 2$\\sigma$} at Galactic latitudes higher than $\\sim${46}$\\degree$. {This\nreport summarizes our contribution presented at the conference on the origin\nand evolution of barionic Galaxy halos}.\n", "  In our conventional understanding, large-scale magnetic fields are thought to\noriginate from an inverse cascade in the presence of magnetic helicity,\ndifferential rotation, or a magneto-rotational instability. However, as recent\nsimulations have given strong indications that an inverse cascade (transfer)\nmay occur even in the absence of magnetic helicity, the physical origin of this\ninverse cascade is still not fully understood. We here present two simulations\nof freely decaying helical \\& non-helical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence.\nWe verified the inverse transfer of helical and non-helical magnetic fields in\nboth cases, but we found the underlying physical principles to be fundamentally\ndifferent. In the former case, the helical magnetic component leads to an\ninverse cascade of magnetic energy. We derived a semi analytic formula for the\nevolution of large scale magnetic field using $\\alpha$ coefficient and compared\nit with the simulation data. But in the latter case, the $\\alpha$ effect,\nincluding other conventional dynamo theories, are not suitable to describe the\ninverse transfer of non-helical magnetic. To obtain a better understanding of\nthe physics at work here, we introduced a `field structure model' based on the\nmagnetic induction equation in the presence of inhomogeneities. This model\nillustrates how the curl of the electromotiveforce (EMF) leads to the build up\nof a large-scale magnetic field without the requirement of magnetic helicity.\nAnd we applied a Quasi Normal approximation to the inverse transfer of magnetic\nenergy.\n", "  The dryland vegetation model proposed by Rietkerk and collaborators has been\nexplored from a bifurcation perspective in several previous studies. Our aim\nhere is to explore in some detail the bifurcation phenomena present when the\ncoefficients of the model are allowed to vary in a wide range of parameters. In\naddition to the primary bifurcation parameter, the precipitation, we allow the\ntwo infiltration rate parameters to vary as well. We find that these two\nparameters control the size and stability of nonhomogeneous biomass states in a\nway that can be predicted. Further, they control when certain homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous (in space) periodic (in time) orbits exist. Finally, we show that\nthe model possesses infinitely many unphysical steady state branches. We then\npresent a modification of the model which eliminates these unphysical\nsolutions, and briefly explore this new model for a fixed set of parameters.\n", "  We establish a Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction which yields a\ncorrespondence between cyclic unitary representations and positive definite\nsuperfunctions of a general class of $\\mathbb Z_2^n$-graded Lie supergroups.\n", "  The thermodynamic formalism expresses chaotic properties of dynamical systems\nin terms of the Ruelle pressure $\\psi(\\beta)$. The inverse-temperature like\nvariable $\\beta$ allows one to scan the structure of the probability\ndistribution in the dynamic phase space. This formalism is applied here to a\nLorentz Lattice Gas, where a particle moving on a lattice of size $L^d$\ncollides with fixed scatterers placed at random locations. Here we give\nrigorous arguments that the Ruelle pressure in the limit of infinit e systems\nhas two branches joining with a slope discontinuity at $\\beta = 1$. The low and\nhigh $\\beta$--branches correspond to localization of trajectories on\nrespectively the ``most chaotic'' (highest density) region, and the ``most\ndeterministic'' (lowest density) region, i.e. $\\psi(\\beta)$ is completely\ncontrolled by rare fluctuations in the distribution of scatterers on the\nlattice, and it does not carry any information on the global structure of the\nstatic disorder.\n  As $\\beta$ approaches unity from either side, a localization-delocalization\ntransition leads to a state where trajectories are extended and carry\ninformation on transport properties. At finite $L$ the narrow region around\n$\\beta = 1$ where the trajectories are extended scales as $(\\ln L)^{-\\alpha}$,\nwhere $\\alpha$ depends on the sign of $1-\\beta$, if $d>1$, and as $(L\\ln\nL)^{-1}$ if $d=1$. This result appears to be general for diffusive systems with\nstatic disorder, such as random walks in random environments or for the\ncontinuous Lorentz gas. Other models of random walks on disordered lattices,\nshowing the same phenomenon, are discussed.\n", "  The thermodynamic formalism of Ruelle, Sinai, and Bowen, in which chaotic\nproperties of dynamical systems are expressed in terms of a free energy-type\nfunction - called the topological pressure - is applied to a Lorentz Lattice\nGas, as typical for diffusive systems with static disorder. In the limit of\nlarge system sizes, the mechanism and effects of localization on large clusters\nof scatterers in the calculation of the topological pressure are elucidated and\nsupported by strong numerical evidence. Moreover it clarifies and illustrates a\nprevious theoretical analysis [Appert et al. J. Stat. Phys. 87,\nchao-dyn/9607019] of this localization phenomenon.\n", "  In the context of brane gas cosmology in superstring theory, we show why it\nis impossible to simultaneously stabilize the dilaton and the radion with a\ngeneral gas of strings (including massless modes) and D-branes. Although this\nrequires invoking a different mechanism to stabilize these moduli fields, we\nfind that the brane gas can still play a crucial role in the early universe in\nassisting moduli stabilization. We show that a modest energy density of\nspecific types of brane gas can solve the overshoot problem that typically\nafflicts potentials arising from gaugino condensation.\n", "  The Weyl algebra,- the usual C*-algebra employed to model the canonical\ncommutation relations (CCRs), has a well-known defect in that it has a large\nnumber of representations which are not regular and these cannot model physical\nfields. Here, we construct explicitly a C*-algebra which can reproduce the CCRs\nof a countably dimensional symplectic space (S,B) and such that its\nrepresentation set is exactly the full set of regular representations of the\nCCRs. This construction uses Blackadar's version of infinite tensor products of\nnonunital C*-algebras, and it produces a \"host algebra\" (i.e. a generalised\ngroup algebra, explained below) for the \\sigma-representation theory of the\nabelian group S where \\sigma(.,.):=e^{iB(.,.)/2}.\n  As an easy application, it then follows that for every regular representation\nof the Weyl algebra of (S,B) on a separable Hilbert space, there is a direct\nintegral decomposition of it into irreducible regular representations (a known\nresult).\n  An Erratum for this paper is added at the end.\n"]}
