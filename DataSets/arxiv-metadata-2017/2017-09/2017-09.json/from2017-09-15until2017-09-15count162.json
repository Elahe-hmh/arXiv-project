The intergalactic magnetic field is assumed to be\nuncorrelated in wave vector space but correlated in real space. Such a field\nmay be obtained if its origin is primordial. Furthermore we assume that the\nquasars, located at cosmological distances, have negligible initial\npolarization. In the presence of pseudoscalar-photon mixing we show, through a\ndirect comparison with observations, that this may explain the observed large\nscale alignments in quasar polarizations within the framework of big bang\ncosmology. We find that the simulation results give a reasonably good fit to\nthe observed data.\n", "  We show that perturbations generated during the anisotropic pre-inflationary\nstage of cosmic evolution may affect cosmological observations today for a\ncertain range of parameters. Due to the anisotropic nature of the universe\nduring such early times, it might explain some of the observed signals of large\nscale anisotropy. In particular we argue that the alignment of CMB quadrupole\nand octopole may be explained by the Sachs-Wolfe effect due to the large scale\nanisotropic modes from very early times of cosmological evolution. We also\ncomment on how the observed dipole modulation of CMB power may be explained\nwithin this framework.\n", "  We introduce a detection scheme for the state of a qubit, which is based on\nresonant few-photon transitions in a driven nonlinear resonator. The latter is\nparametrically coupled to the qubit and is used as its detector. Close to the\nfundamental resonator frequency, the nonlinear resonator shows sharp resonant\nfew-photon transitions. Depending on the qubit state, these few-photon\nresonances are shifted to different driving frequencies. We show that this\ndetection scheme offers the advantage of small back action, a large\ndiscrimination power with an enhanced read-out fidelity, and a sufficiently\nlarge measurement efficiency. A realization of this scheme in the form of a\npersistent current qubit inductively coupled to a driven SQUID detector in its\nnonlinear regime is discussed.\n", "  Quantum electrodynamics presents intrinsic limitations in the description of\nphysical processes that make it impossible to recover from it the type of\ndescription we have in classical electrodynamics. Hence one cannot consider\nclassical electrodynamics as reducing to quantum electrodynamics and being\nrecovered from it by some sort of limiting procedure. Quantum electrodynamics\nhas to be seen not as a more fundamental theory, but as an upgrade of classical\nelectrodynamics, which permits an extension of classical theory to the\ndescription of phenomena that, while being related to the conceptual framework\nof the classical theory, cannot be addressed from the classical theory.\n", "  The advent of the 1905 theory of relativity is rightly considered as a\nbreakthrough moment in the history of physics; in particular. it is widely\naccepted that it brought a new conception of space and time. The purpose of\nthis work is to reevaluate to what point and in what sense can we consider that\nthe conception of space and time went through a transformation when going from\nNewtonian mechanics to the theory of relativity.\n", "  We present and analyze epsilon Aurigae data concerning the evolution of the\nH$\\alpha$ line on the occasion of the 2009 International observation campaign\nlaunched to cover the eclipse of this object. About 250 high resolution spectra\nof the H$\\alpha$ line were obtained by amateur covering the three years around\neclipse. We visually inspect the dynamical spectrum constructed from the data\nand analyze the evolution with time of the radial velocity and of EW\n(Equivalent Width) vs V mag. The spectroscopic data reveal many details which\nconfirm the complexity of the Aurigae system. The object is far from being\nunderstood. In particular, according to our measurements, the eclipse duration\nhas been underestimated and key dates were defined. A complete analysis of\ndetails revealed by our data would require much time and effort. Observers are\nencouraged to continue monitoring the H$\\alpha$ line out of eclipse in the hope\nthat it will provide further important information.\n", "  Recent experimental researches on semiconductors with mobile dopants (SMD)\nhave reported unconventional hysteretic current-voltage (I-V) curves, which\nform dynamically in either one of the two opposite directions, the\ncounter-figure-eight and figure-eight ways. However the fundamental theory for\nthe formation of the two directions is still absent, and this poses a major\nbarrier for researches oriented to applications. Here, we introduce a\ntheoretical model to explain the origin of the two directions, and find that\nthe two ways originate from the spatial inhomogeneity of the dopant\ndistribution in SMD. The counter-figure-eight (figure-eight) way of the\nhysteretic curve is obtained when dopants are driven from far from (near) the\nSchottky interface to the opposite side in the SMD. This finding indicates that\nthe directions of hysteretic curve in SMD can be controlled.\n", "  We show that the rate of switching between the vibrational states of a\nmodulated nonlinear oscillator is characterized by a quantum critical\ntemperature $T_c\\propto\\hbar^2$. The rate is independent of $T$ for $T<T_c$.\nAbove $T_c$ there emerges a quantum crossover region where the slope of the\nlogarithm of the distribution over the oscillator states displays a kink and\nthe switching rate has the Arrhenius form with the activation energy\nindependent of the modulation. The results demonstrate the limitations of the\nreal-time instanton theory of switching in systems lacking detailed balance.\n", "  When addressing the notion of proper time in the theory of relativity, it is\nusually taken for granted that the time read by an accelerated clock is given\nby the Minkowski proper time. However, there are authors like Harvey Brown that\nconsider necessary an extra assumption to arrive at this result, the so-called\nclock hypothesis. In opposition to Brown, Richard T. W. Arthur takes the clock\nhypothesis to be already implicit in the theory. In this paper I will present a\nview different from these authors by recovering Einstein's notion of natural\nclock and showing its relevance to the debate.\n", "  According to conventional wisdom, presentism is at odds with the theory of\nrelativity. This is supposed to be shown quite simply just by considering the\nrelativity of simultaneity. In this paper I will show that conventional wisdom\nis wrong. In fact by clarifying the physical meaning of the relativity of\nsimultaneity one can inform the philosophical debate and endorse a presentist\nview.\n", "  We study several anisotropic inflationary models and their implications for\nthe observed violation of statistical isotropy in the CMBR data. In two of\nthese models the anisotropy decays very quickly during the inflationary phase\nof expansion. We explicitly show that these models lead to violation of\nisotropy only for low l CMBR modes. Our primary aim is to fit the observed\nalignment of l=2,3 multipoles to the theoretical models. We use two measures,\nbased on the power tensor, which contains information about the alignment of\neach multipole, to quantify the anisotropy in data. One of the measures uses\nthe dispersion in eigenvalues of the power tensor. We also define another\nmeasure which tests the overall correlation between two different multipoles.\nWe perturbatively compute these measures of anisotropy and fix the theoretical\nparameters by making a best fit to l=2,3 multipoles. We show that some of the\nmodels studied are able to consistently explain the observed violation of\nstatistical isotropy.\n", "  With a modulated oscillator, we study several effects of quantum fluctuations\nfar from thermal equilibrium. One of them is quantum heating, where quantum\nfluctuations lead to a finite-width distribution of a resonantly modulated\noscillator over its quasienergy (Floquet) states. We also analyze large rare\nfluctuations responsible for the tail of the quasienergy distribution and\nswitching between the states of forced vibrations. We find an observable\ncharacteristic of these fluctuations, the most probable paths followed by the\nquasienergy in rare events, and in particular in switching. We also explore the\ndiscontinuous change of the most probable switching path where the detailed\nbalance condition is broken. For oscillators modulated by a nonresonant field,\nwe compare different mechanisms of the field-induced cooling and heating of the\noscillator.\n", "  We present a scattering theory description for the inelastic current noise in\nthe presence of electron-vibration interactions. In this description, we\nspecify elastic and inelastic scattering contributions to the shot noise by\nexamining charge transfers between scattering states and energy exchange\nbetween electrons and vibrations. The elastic and inelastic scattering\nprocesses are further decomposed into current correlations of electrons at the\nsame energy and those of electrons at different energies. Focusing on the\ninelastic noise signals defined as steps in the voltage derivative of the shot\nnoise, we show that single-channel systems have two ranges of transmission at\nwhich the inelastic noise signals exhibit the crossover between positive and\nnegative signs. In a high transmission regime, even and odd vibrational modes\nof mirror-symmetric systems provide upper and lower bounds to the ratio of the\ninelastic noise signal to the conductance step. This can be a theoretical\njustification for models used to understand the recent noise experiment [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 108, 146602 (2012)] and numerical calculations on gold atomic chains\n[Phys. Rev. B 86, 155411 (2012)].\n", "  Dennis Dieks advanced the view that the idea of flow of time is implemented\nin the theory of relativity. The 'flow' results from the successive\nhappening/becoming of events along the time-like worldline of a material\nsystem. This leads to a view of now as local to each worldline. Each past event\nof the worldline has occurred once as a nowpoint, and we take there to be an\never-changing present now-point 'marking' the unfolding of a physical system.\nIn Dieks' approach there is no preferred worldline and only along each\nworldline is there a Newtonian-like linear order between successive now-points.\nWe have a flow of time per worldline. Also there is no global temporal order of\nthe now-points of different worldlines. There is, as much, what Dieks calls a\npartial order. However Dieks needs for a consistency reason to impose a\nlimitation on the assignment of the now-points along different worldlines. In\nthis work it is made the claim that Dieks' consistency requirement is, in fact,\ninbuilt in the theory as a spatial relation between physical systems and\nprocesses. Furthermore, in this work we will consider (very) particular cases\nof assignments of now-points restricted by this spatial relation, in which the\nnow-points taken to be simultaneous are not relative to the adopted inertial\nreference frame.\n", "  A simplified differential equations approach for Master Integrals is\npresented. It allows to express them, straightforwardly, in terms of Goncharov\nPolylogarithms. As a proof-of-concept of the proposed method, results at one\nand two loops are presented, including the massless one-loop pentagon with up\nto one off-shell leg at order epsilon.\n", "  We solve the two-particle s-wave scattering for an ultracold atom gas\nconfined in a quasi-one-dimensional trapping potential which is periodically\nmodulated. The interaction between the atoms is included in terms of Fermi's\npseudopotential. For a modulated isotropic transverse harmonic confinement, the\natomic center of mass and relative degrees of freedom decouple and an exact\nsolution is possible. We use the Floquet approach to show that additional\nphoton-assisted resonant scattering channels open up due to the harmonic\nmodulation. Applying the Bethe-Peierls boundary condition, we obtain the\ngeneral scattering solution of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation which\nis universal at low energies. The binding energies and the effective\none-dimensional scattering length can be controlled by the external driving.\n", "  We relate the observed hemispherical anisotropy in the cosmic microwave\nradiation data to an inhomogeneous power spectrum model. The hemispherical\nanisotropy can be parameterized in terms of the dipole modulation model. This\nmodel leads to correlations between spherical harmonic coefficients\ncorresponding to multipoles, l and l+1. We extract the $l$ dependence of the\ndipole modulation amplitude, A, by making a fit to the WMAP and PLANCK CMBR\ndata. We propose an inhomogeneous power spectrum model and show that it also\nleads to correlations between multipoles, l and l+1. The model parameters are\ndetermined by making a fit to the data. The spectral index of the inhomogeneous\npower spectrum is found to be consistent with zero.\n", "  This paper investigates the properties of unstable single-spiral wave\nsolutions arising in the Karma model of two-dimensional cardiac tissue. In\nparticular, we discuss how such solutions can be computed numerically on\ndomains of arbitrary shape and study how their stability, rotational frequency,\nand spatial drift depend on the size of the domain as well as the position of\nthe spiral core with respect to the boundaries. We also discuss how the\nbreaking of local Euclidean symmetry due to finite size effects as well as the\nspatial discretization of the model is reflected in the structure and dynamics\nof spiral waves. This analysis allows identification of a self-sustaining\nprocess responsible for maintaining the state of spiral chaos featuring\nmultiple interacting spirals.\n", "  We present the implications for cosmic inflation of the Planck measurements\nof the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies in both temperature and\npolarization based on the full Planck survey. The Planck full mission\ntemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angular\nscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be\n$n_\\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \\pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to\n$d n_s/d \\ln k =-0.003 \\pm 0.007$ when combined with the Planck lensing\nlikelihood. When the high-$\\ell$ polarization data is included, the results are\nconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. The upper bound on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} < 0.11$ (95% CL), consistent with the\nB-mode polarization constraint $r< 0.12$ (95% CL) obtained from a joint\nBICEP2/Keck Array and Planck analysis. These results imply that $V(\\phi)\n\\propto \\phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to models\npredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $R^2$ inflation. Three\nindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum are\ninvestigated. The Planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordial\nperturbations. We investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropic\nmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalized\nmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kinetic\nterm. The 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on the\nnominal mission data.\n", "  We reformulate the Lagrange deformed field-antifield BV -formalism suggested,\nin terms of the general Euler vector field $N$ generated by the antisymplectic\npotential. That $N$ generalizes, in a natural anticanonically-invariant manner,\nthe usual power-counting operator. We provide for the \"usual\" gauge-fixing\nmechanism as applied to the deformed BV -formalism.\n", "  In a single j-shell calculation we consider the effects of several different\ninteractions on the values of Gamow-Teller (B(GT)'s) and magnetic moments. The\ninteractions used are MBZE, J=0 pairing, J_{max} pairing and half and half.\n", "  We discuss the chiral anomaly for a Weyl field in a curved background and\nshow that a novel index theorem for the Lorentzian Dirac operator can be\napplied to describe the gravitational chiral anomaly. A formula for the total\ncharge generated by the gravitational and gauge field background is derived in\na mathematically rigorous manner. It contains a term identical to the integrand\nin the Atiyah-Singer index theorem and another term involving the\n$\\eta$-invariant of the Cauchy hypersurfaces.\n", "  I prove that the Bethe roots describing either the ground state or a certain\nclass of \"particle-hole\" excited states of the XXZ spin-$1/2$ chain in any\nsector with magnetisation $\\mathfrak{m} \\in [0;1/2]$ exist and form, in the\ninfinite volume limit, a dense distribution on a subinterval of $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe results holds for any value of the anisotropy $\\Delta \\geq -1 $. In fact, I\nestablish an even stronger result, namely the existence of an all order\nasymptotic expansion of the counting function associated with such roots. As a\ncorollary, these results allow one to prove the existence and form of the\ninfinite volume limit of various observables attached to the model -the\nexcitation energy, momentum, the zero temperature correlation functions, so as\nto name a few- that were argued earlier in the literature.\n", "  We consider periodic traveling waves in FPU-type chains with superpolynomial\ninteraction forces and derive explicit asymptotic formulas for the high-energy\nlimit as well as bounds for the corresponding approximation error. In the proof\nwe adapt twoscale techniques that have recently been develop by Herrmann and\nMatthies for chains with singular potential and provide an asymptotic ODE for\nthe scaled distance profile.\n", "  This paper introduces a numerical method for computing the spectrum of\nadjoint (left) eigenfunctions of spiral wave solutions to reaction-diffusion\nsystems in arbitrary geometries. The method is illustrated by computing over a\nhundred eigenfunctions associated with an unstable time-periodic single-spiral\nsolution of the Karma model on a square domain. We show that all leading\nadjoint eigenfunctions are exponentially localized in the vicinity of the\nspiral tip, although the marginal modes (response functions) demonstrate the\nstrongest localization. We also discuss the implications of the localization\nfor the dynamics and control of unstable spiral waves. In particular, the\ninteraction with no-flux boundaries leads to a drift of spiral waves which can\nbe understood with the help of the response functions.\n", "  The rare-earth based pyrochlore molybdates involve orbitally degenerate\nelectrons Hund's coupled to local moments. The large Hund's coupling promotes\nferromagnetism, the superexchange between the local moments prefers\nantiferromagnetism, and Hubbard repulsion tries to open a Mott gap. The phase\ncompetition is tuned by the rare-earth ionic radius, decreasing which leads to\nchange from a ferromagnetic metal to a spin disordered highly resistive ground\nstate, and ultimately an 'Anderson-Mott' insulator. We attempt a quantitative\ntheory of the molybdates by studying their minimal model on a pyrochlore\ngeometry, using a static auxiliary field based Monte Carlo. We establish a\nthermal phase diagram that closely corresponds to the experiments, predict the\nhitherto unexplored orbital correlations, quantify and explain the origin of\nthe anomalous resistivity, and present dynamical properties across the\nmetal-insulator transition.\n", "  Optomechanical arrays are a promising future platform for studies of\ntransport, many-body dynamics, quantum control and topological effects in\nsystems of coupled photon and phonon modes. We introduce disordered\noptomechanical arrays, focusing on features of Anderson localization of hybrid\nphoton-phonon excitations. It turns out that these represent a unique\ndisordered system, where basic parameters can be easily controlled by varying\nthe frequency and the amplitude of an external laser field. We show that the\ntwo-species setting leads to a non-trivial frequency dependence of the\nlocalization length for intermediate laser intensities. This could serve as a\nconvincing evidence of localization in a non-equilibrium dissipative situation.\n", "  Interfacial phonons between iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) and perovskite\nsubstrates have received considerable attention due to the possibility of\nenhancing preexisting superconductivity. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy,\nwe studied the correlation between superconductivity and e-ph interaction with\ninterfacial-phonons in an iron-based superconductor Sr$_2$VO$_3$FeAs ($T_c\n\\approx$ 33 K) made of alternating FeSC and oxide layers. The quasiparticle\ninterference measurement over regions with systematically different average\nsuperconducting gaps due to the e-ph coupling locally modulated by O vacancies\nin VO$_2$ layer, and supporting self-consistent momentum-dependent Eliashberg\ncalculations provide a unique real-space evidence of the forward-scattering\ninterfacial phonon contribution to the total superconducting pairing.\n", "  A conventional periodic LC ladder circuit forms a transmission line that has\na regular band edge between a pass and a stop band. Here for the first time we\ndevelop the theory of simple yet unconventional double ladder circuit that\nexhibits a special degeneracy condition referred to as degenerate band edge\n(DBE). The degeneracy occurs when four independent eigenstates coalesce into a\nsingle eigenstate at the DBE frequency. In addition to possible practical\napplications, this circuit may provide insight into DBE behavior that is not\nclear in more complex systems. We show that double ladder resonators exhibit\nunusual behavior of the loaded quality factor near the DBE leading to a stable\nresonance frequency against load variations. These two properties in the\nproposed circuit are superior to the analogous properties in single ladder\ncircuits. Our proposed analysis leads to analytic expressions for all circuit\nquantities thus providing insight into the very complex behavior near\ndegeneracy points in periodic circuits. Interestingly, here we show for the\nfirst time that DBE is obtained with unit cells that are symmetric along the\npropagation direction. The proposed theory of double ladders presented here has\npotential applications in filters, couplers, oscillators, and pulse shaping\nnetworks.\n", "  It is demonstrated how the non-proprietary OpenACC standard of compiler\ndirectives may be used to compactly and efficiently accelerate the\nrate-determining steps of two of the most routinely applied many-body methods\nof electronic structure theory, namely the second-order M{\\o}ller-Plesset (MP2)\nmodel in its resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximated form and the (T)\ntriples correction to the coupled cluster singles and doubles model (CCSD(T)).\nBy means of compute directives as well as the use of optimized device math\nlibraries, the operations involved in the energy kernels have been ported to\ngraphics processing unit (GPU) accelerators, and the associated data transfers\ncorrespondingly optimized to such a degree that the final implementations\n(using either double and/or single precision arithmetics) are capable of\nscaling to as large systems as allowed for by the capacity of the host central\nprocessing unit (CPU) main memory. The performance of the hybrid CPU/GPU\nimplementations is assessed through calculations on test systems of alanine\namino acid chains using one-electron basis sets of increasing size (ranging\nfrom double- to pentuple-zeta quality). For all but the smallest problem sizes\nof the present study, the optimized accelerated codes (using a single\nmulti-core CPU host node in conjunction with six GPUs) are found to be capable\nof reducing the total time-to-solution by at least an order of magnitude over\noptimized, OpenMP-threaded CPU-only reference implementations.\n", "  How cells move through the three-dimensional extracellular matrix (ECM) is of\nincreasing interest in attempts to understand important biological processes\nsuch as cancer metastasis. Just as in motion on flat surfaces, it is expected\nthat experimental measurements of cell-generated forces will provide valuable\ninformation for uncovering the mechanisms of cell migration. However, the\nrecovery of forces in fibrous biopolymer networks may suffer from large errors.\nHere, within the framework of lattice-based models, we explore possible issues\nin force recovery by solving the inverse problem: how can one determine the\nforces cells exert to their surroundings from the deformation of the ECM? Our\nresults indicate that irregular cell traction patterns, the uncertainty of\nlocal fiber stiffness, the non-affine nature of ECM deformations and inadequate\nknowledge of network topology will all prevent the precise force determination.\nAt the end, we discuss possible ways of overcoming these difficulties.\n", "  We present a transmission line theory of exceptional points of degeneracy\n(EPD) in coupled-mode guiding structures, i.e., a theory that illustrates the\ncharacteristics of coupled electromagnetic modes under a special dispersion\ndegeneracy condition, yet unexplored in the contest of gain and loss. We\ndemonstrate the concept of Parity-Time ($\\cal{PT}$)-symmetry in coupled uniform\nwaveguides with balanced and symmetric gain and loss and how this condition is\nassociated with a second order EPD. We show that by introducing gain into\nnaturally lossy structures provides for the conditions whereby exceptional\npoints of non-Hermitian degeneracies can be manifested, such as in $\\cal{PT}$-\nsymmetric structures. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that $\\cal{PT}$-\nsymmetry, despite being the method often suggested for obtaining non-Hermitian\ndegeneracies at optical frequencies, is not a necessary condition and indeed we\nshow that EPD can be obtained with broken topological symmetry in uniform TLs.\nOperating near such special degeneracy conditions leads to potential\nperformance enhancement in a variety of microwave and optical resonators, and\ndevices such as distributed oscillators, including lasers, amplifiers,\nradiating arrays, pulse compressors, and Qswitching sensors.\n", "  The origin of the progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is still\nuncertain. The core-degenerate (CD) scenario has been proposed as an\nalternative way for the production of SNe Ia. In this scenario, SNe Ia are\nformed at the final stage of common-envelope evolution from a merger of a\ncarbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) with the CO core of an asymptotic giant\nbranch companion. However, the birthrates of SNe Ia from this scenario are\nstill not well determined. In this work, we performed a detailed investigation\non the CD scenario based on a binary population synthesis approach. The SN Ia\ndelay times from this scenario are basically in the range of 90Myr-2500Myr,\nmainly contributing to the observed SNe Ia with short and intermediate delay\ntimes although this scenario can also produce some old SNe Ia. Meanwhile, our\nwork indicates that the Galactic birthrates of SNe Ia from this scenario are no\nmore than 20% of total SNe Ia due to more careful treatment of mass transfer.\nAlthough the SN Ia birthrates in the present work are lower than those in Ilkov\n& Soker, the CD scenario cannot be ruled out as a viable mechanism for the\nformation of SNe Ia. Especially, SNe Ia with circumstellar material from this\nscenario contribute to 0.7-10% of total SNe Ia, which means that the CD\nscenario can reproduce the observed birthrates of SNe Ia like PTF 11kx. We also\nfound that SNe Ia happen systemically earlier for a high value of metallicity\nand their birthrates increase with metallicity.\n", "  The nanoscale distribution of magnetic anisotropies was measured in\ncore@shell MnFe$_2$O$_4$@CoFe$_2$O$_4$ 7.0 nm particles using a combination of\nelement selective magnetic spectroscopies with different probing depths. As\nthis picture is not accessible by any other technique, emergent magnetic\nproperties were revealed. The coercive field is not constant in a whole\nnanospinel. The very thin (0.5 nm) CoFe$_2$O$_4$ hard shell imposes a strong\nmagnetic anisotropy to the otherwise very soft MnFe$_2$O$_4$ core: a large\ngradient in coercivity was measured inside the MnFe$_2$O$_4$ core with lower\nvalues close to the interface region, while the inner core presents a\nsubstantial coercive field (0.54 T) and a very high remnant magnetization (90%\nof the magnetization at saturation).\n", "  To address the large gap between time scales that can be easily reached by\nmolecular simulations and those required to understand protein dynamics, we\npropose a rapid self-consistent approximation of the side chain free energy at\nevery integration step. In analogy with the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation for electronic structure, the protein backbone dynamics are\nsimulated as preceding according to the dictates of the free energy of an\ninstantaneously-equilibrated side chain potential. The side chain free energy\nis computed on the fly, allowing the protein backbone dynamics to traverse a\ngreatly smoothed energetic landscape. This results in extremely rapid\nequilibration and sampling of the Boltzmann distribution. Because our method\nemploys a reduced model involving single-bead side chains, we also provide a\nnovel, maximum-likelihood method to parameterize the side chain model using\ninput data from high resolution protein crystal structures. We demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art accuracy for predicting $\\chi_1$ rotamer states while\nconsuming only milliseconds of CPU time. We also show that the resulting free\nenergies of side chains is sufficiently accurate for de novo folding of some\nproteins.\n", "  In a way similar to classical mechanics where we have the concept of inertial\ntime as expressed in the motions of bodies, in the (special) theory of\nrelativity we can regard the inertial time as the only notion of time at play.\nThe inertial time is expressed also in the propagation of light. This gives\nrise to a notion of clock, the light clock, which we can regard as a notion\nderived from the inertial time. The light clock can be seen as a solution of\nthe theory, which complies with the requirement that a clock to be so must have\na rate that is independent of its past history. Contrary to Einstein's view, we\ndo not need the concept of clock as an independent concept. This implies, in\nparticular, that we do not need to rely on the notions of atomic clock or\natomic time in the theory of relativity.\n", "  Electrocaloric (EC) materials show promise in eco-friendly solid-state\nrefrigeration and integrable on-chip thermal management. While direct\nmeasurement of EC thin-films still remains challenging, a generic theoretical\nframework for quantifying the cooling properties of rich EC materials including\nnormal-, relaxor-, organic- and anti-ferroelectrics is imperative for\nexploiting new flexible and room-temperature cooling alternatives. Here, we\npresent a versatile theory that combines Master equation with Maxwell relations\nand analytically relates the macroscopic cooling responses in EC materials with\nthe intrinsic diffuseness of phase transitions and correlation characteristics.\nUnder increased electric fields, both EC entropy and adiabatic temperature\nchanges increase quadratically initially, followed by further linear growth and\neventual gradual saturation. The upper bound of entropy change (dS_max) is\nlimited by distinct correlation volumes (V_cr) and transition diffuseness. The\nlinearity between V_cr and the transition diffuseness is emphasized, while\ndS_max=300 kJ/(K.m3) is obtained for Pb0.8Ba0.2ZrO3. The dS_max in\nantiferroelectric Pb0.95Zr0.05TiO3, Pb0.8Ba0.2ZrO3 and polymeric ferroelectrics\nscales proportionally with V_cr^(-2.2), owing to the one-dimensional structural\nconstraint on lattice-scale depolarization dynamics; whereas dS_max in relaxor\nand normal ferroelectrics scales as dS_max ~ V_cr^(-0.37), which tallies with a\ndipolar interaction exponent of 2/3 in EC materials and the well-proven\nfractional dimensionality of 2.5 for ferroelectric domain walls.\n", "  We report measurements of a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator\n(CPWR) coupled to a sphere of yttrium-iron garnet. The non-uniform CPWR field\nallows us to excite various magnon modes in the sphere. Mode frequencies and\nrelative coupling strengths are consistent with theory. Strong coupling is\nobserved to several modes even with, on average, less than one excitation\npresent in the CPWR. The time response to square pulses shows oscillations at\nthe mode splitting frequency. These results indicate the feasibility of\ncombining magnonic and planar superconducting quantum devices.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate for the first time the degenerate band edge\n(DBE) condition, namely the degeneracy of four Bloch modes, in loaded circular\nmetallic waveguides. The four modes forming the DBE represent a degeneracy of\nfourth order occurring in a periodic structure where four Bloch modes, two\npropagating and two evanescent, coalesce. It leads to a very flat\nwavenumber-frequency dispersion relation, and the finite length structure's\nquality factor scales as $N^5$ where $N$ is the number of unit cells. The\nproposed waveguide in which DBE is observed here is designed by periodically\nloading a circular waveguide with misaligned elliptical metallic rings,\nsupported by a low-index dielectric. We validate the existence of the DBE in\nsuch structure using measurements and we report good agreement between\nfull-wave simulation and the measured response of the waveguide near the DBE\nfrequency; taking into account metallic losses. We correlate our finding to\ntheoretical and simulation results utilizing various techniques including\ndispersion synthesis, as well as observing how quality factor and group delay\nscale as the structure length increases. Moreover, the reported geometry is\nonly an example of metallic waveguide with DBE: DBE and its characteristics can\nalso be designed in many other kinds of waveguides and various applications can\nbe contemplated as high microwave generation in amplifiers and oscillators\nbased on an electron beam interaction or solid state devices, pulse compressors\nand microwave sensors.\n", "  Geometry, whether on the atomic or nanoscale, is a key factor for the\nelectronic band structure of materials. Some specific geometries give rise to\nnovel and potentially useful electronic bands. For example, a honeycomb lattice\nleads to Dirac-type bands where the charge carriers behave as massless\nparticles. Theoretical predictions are triggering the exploration of novel 2D\ngeometries, such as graphynes, Kagom\\'{e} and the Lieb lattice. The latter is\nthe 2D analogue of the 3D lattice exhibited by perovskites; it is a\nsquare-depleted lattice, which is characterised by a band structure featuring\nDirac cones intersected by a topological flat band. Whereas photonic and\ncold-atom Lieb lattices have been demonstrated, an electronic equivalent in 2D\nis difficult to realize in an existing material. Here, we report an electronic\nLieb lattice formed by the surface state electrons of Cu(111) confined by an\narray of CO molecules positioned with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM).\nUsing scanning tunneling microscopy, spectroscopy and wave-function mapping, we\nconfirm the predicted characteristic electronic structure of the Lieb lattice.\nThe experimental findings are corroborated by muffin-tin and tight-binding\ncalculations. At higher energy, second-order electronic patterns are observed,\nwhich are equivalent to a super-Lieb lattice.\n", "  In thermodynamics, there exists a conventional belief that \"the Carnot\nefficiency is reachable only when a process is reversible.\" However, there is\nno theorem proving that the Carnot efficiency is unattainable in an\nirreversible process. Here, we show that the Carnot efficiency is reachable in\nan irreversible process through investigation of the Feynman-Smoluchowski\nratchet (FSR). We also show that it is possible to enhance the efficiency by\nincreasing the irreversibility. Our result opens a new possibility of designing\nan efficient heat engine in a highly irreversible process and also answers the\nlong-standing question of whether the FSR can operate with the Carnot\nefficiency.\n", "  Within an isospin and momentum dependent transport model, the dynamics of\nisospin particles (nucleons and light clusters) in Fermi-energy heavy-ion\ncollisions are investigated for constraining the isospin splitting of nucleon\neffective mass and the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities. The mass\nsplitting of $m^{*}_{n}>m^{*}_{p}$ and $m^{*}_{n}<m^{*}_{p}$ in nuclear matter\nand the different stiffness of symmetry energy are used in the model. The\nsingle and double neutron to proton ratios of free nucleons and light particles\nare thoroughly investigated in the isotopic nuclear reactions of\n$^{112}$Sn+$^{112}$Sn and $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn at the incident energies of 50\nand 120 MeV/nucleon, respectively. It is found that the both effective mass\nsplitting and symmetry energy impact the kinetic energy spectra of the single\nratios, in particular at the high energy tail (larger than 20 MeV). Specific\nconstraints are obtained from the double ratio spectra, which are evaluated\nfrom the ratios of isospin observables produced in $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn over\n$^{112}$Sn+$^{112}$Sn collisions. A mass splitting of $m^{*}_{n}<m^{*}_{p}$ is\nconstrained from the available data at the energy of 120 MeV/nucleon. A soft\nsymmetry energy with the stiffness of $\\gamma_{s}=$0.5 is close to the\nexperimental double ratio spectra at both energies.\n", "  In-plane hole g-factors measured in quantum point contacts based on p-type\nheterostructures strongly depend on the orientation of the magnetic field with\nrespect to the electric current. This effect, first reported a decade ago and\nconfirmed in a number of publications, has remained an open problem. In this\nwork, we present systematic experimental studies to disentangle different\nmechanisms contributing to the effect and develop the theory which describes it\nsuccessfully. We show that there is a new mechanism for the anisotropy related\nto the existence of an additional $B_+k_-^4\\sigma_+$ effective Zeeman\ninteraction for holes, which is kinematically different from the standard\nsingle Zeeman term $B_-k_-^2\\sigma_+$ considered until now.\n", "  A fundamental manifestation of wave scattering in a disordered medium is the\nhighly complex intensity pattern the waves acquire due to multi-path\ninterference. Here we show that these intensity variations can be entirely\nsuppressed by adding disorder-specific gain and loss components to the medium.\nThe resulting constant-intensity (CI) waves in such non-Hermitian scattering\nlandscapes are free of any backscattering and feature perfect transmission\nthrough the disorder. An experimental demonstration of these unique wave states\nis envisioned based on spatially modulated pump beams that can flexibly control\nthe gain and loss components in an active medium.\n", "  We study the superconducting instability and the resulting superconducting\nstates in a two-dimensional repulsive Fermi gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling\nat low electron density (namely the Fermi energy $E_F$ is lower than the energy\n$E_R$ of the Dirac point induced by Rashba coupling). We find that\nsuperconductivity is enhanced as the dimensionless Fermi energy $\\epsilon_F$\n($\\epsilon_F\\equiv E_F/E_R$) decreases, due to the following two reasons.\nFirst, the density of states at $\\epsilon_F$ increases as\n$1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon_F}$. Second, the particle-hole bubble becomes more\nanisotropic, resulting in an increasing effective attraction. The\nsuperconducting state is always in the total angular momentum $j_z=+2$ (or\n$j_z=-2$) channel with Chern number $C=4$ (or $C=-4$), breaking time reversal\nsymmetry spontaneously. Although a putative Leggett mode is expected due to the\ntwo-gap nature of the superconductivity, we find that it is always damped. More\nimportantly, once a sufficiently large Zeeman coupling is applied to the\nsuperconducting state, the Chern number can be tuned to be $\\pm1$ and Majorana\nzero modes exist in the vortex cores.\n", "  We investigate an extension of the quantum Ising model in one spatial\ndimension including long-range $1 / r^{\\alpha}$ interactions in its statics and\ndynamics with possible applications from heteronuclear polar molecules in\noptical lattices to trapped ions described by two-state spin systems. We\nintroduce the statics of the system via both numerical techniques with finite\nsize and infinite size matrix product states and a theoretical approaches using\na truncated Jordan-Wigner transformation for the ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic case and show that finite size effects have a crucial role\nshifting the quantum critical point of the external field by fifteen percent\nbetween thirty-two and around five-hundred spins. We numerically study the\nKibble-Zurek hypothesis in the long-range quantum Ising model with Matrix\nProduct States. A linear quench of the external field through the quantum\ncritical point yields a power-law scaling of the defect density as a function\nof the total quench time. For example, the increase of the defect density is\nslower for longer-range models and the critical exponent changes by twenty-five\nper cent. Our study emphasizes the importance of such long-range interactions\nin statics and dynamics that could point to similar phenomena in a different\nsetup of dynamical systems or for other models.\n", "  Descriptions of quantum algorithms, communication etc. protocols assume the\nexistence of closed quantum system. However, real life quantum systems are open\nand are highly sensitive to errors. Hence error correction is of utmost\nimportance if quantum computation is to be carried out in reality. Ideally, an\nerror correction block should be placed after every gate operation in a quantum\ncircuit. This increases the overhead and reduced the speedup of the quantum\ncircuit. Moreover, the error correction blocks themselves may induce errors as\nthe gates used for error correction may be noisy. In this paper, we have\nproposed a procedure to trace error probability due to noisy gates and\ndecoherence in quantum circuit and place an error correcting block only when\nthe error probability exceeds a certain threshold. This procedure shows a\ndrastic reduction in the required number of error correcting blocks.\nFurthermore, we have considered concatenated codes with tile structure layout\nlattice architecture[25][21],[24] and SWAP gate based qubit transport\nmechanism. Tracing errors in higher levels of concatenation shows that, in most\ncases, after 1 or 2 levels of concatenation, the number of QECC blocks required\nbecome static. However, since the gate count increases with increasing\nconcatenation, the percentage saving in gate count is considerably high.\n", "  We study the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model with a purely\nimaginary magnetic field, which can be thought of as a toy model for the usual\n$\\theta$ physics. Our motivation is to have a benchmark calculation in a system\nwhich suffers from a strong sign problem, so that our results can be used to\ntest Monte Carlo methods developed to tackle such problems. We analyze here\nthis model by means of analytical techniques, computing exactly the first eight\ncumulants of the expansion of the effective Hamiltonian in powers of the\ninverse temperature, and calculating physical observables for a large number of\ndegrees of freedom with the help of standard multi-precision algorithms. We\nreport accurate results for the free energy density, internal energy, standard\nand staggered magnetization, and the position and nature of the critical line,\nwhich confirm the mean-field qualitative picture, and which should be\nquantitatively reliable, at least in the high-temperature regime, including the\nentire critical line.\n", "  We provide numerical simulations of an incompressible pressure-thickening and\nshear-thinning lubricant flowing in a plane slider bearing. We study the\ninfluence of several parameters, namely the ratio of the characteristic lengths\n$\\varepsilon>0$ (with $\\varepsilon\\searrow0$ representing the Reynolds\nlubrication approximation); the coefficient of the exponential\npressure--viscosity relation $\\alpha^*\\geq0$; the parameter $G^*\\geq0$ related\nto the Carreau--Yasuda shear-thinning model and the modified Reynolds number\n$\\mathrm{Re}_\\varepsilon\\geq0$. The finite element approximations to the steady\nisothermal flows are computed without resorting to the lubrication\napproximation. We obtain the numerical solutions as long as the variation of\nthe viscous stress $\\mathbf{S}=2\\eta(p,\\mathrm{tr}\\mathbf{D}^2)\\mathbf{D}$ with\nthe pressure is limited, say $|\\partial\\mathbf{S}/\\partial p|\\leq1$. We show\nconclusively that the existing practice of avoiding the numerical difficulties\nby cutting the viscosity off for large pressures leads to results that depend\nsorely on the artificial cut-off parameter. We observe that the piezoviscous\nrheology generates pressure differences across the fluid film.\n", "  In this paper, we reveal the relationship between entropy rate and the\ncongestion in complex network and solve it analytically for special cases.\nFinding maximizing entropy rate will lead to an improvement of traffic\nefficiency, we propose a method to mitigate congestion by allocating limited\ntraffic capacity to the nodes in network rationally. Different from former\nstrategies, our method only requires local and observable information of\nnetwork, and is low-cost and widely applicable in practice. In the simulation\nof the phase transition for various network models, our method performs well in\nmitigating congestion both locally and globally. By comparison, we also uncover\nthe deficiency of former degree-biased approaches. Owing to the rapid\ndevelopment of transportation networks, our method may be helpful for modern\nsociety.\n", "  We study correlations in fermionic lattice systems with long-range\ninteractions in thermal equilibrium. We prove a bound on the correlation decay\nbetween anti-commuting operators and generalize a long-range Lieb-Robinson type\nbound. Our results show that in these systems of spatial dimension $D$ with,\nnot necessarily translation invariant, two-site interactions decaying\nalgebraically with the distance with an exponent $\\alpha \\geq 2\\,D$,\ncorrelations between such operators decay at least algebraically with an\nexponent arbitrarily close to $\\alpha$ at any non-zero temperature. Our bound\nis asymptotically tight, which we demonstrate by a high temperature expansion\nand by numerically analyzing density-density correlations in the 1D quadratic\n(free, exactly solvable) Kitaev chain with long-range pairing.\n", "  Photosynthetic organisms rely on a series of self-assembled nanostructures\nwith tuned electronic energy levels in order to transport energy from where it\nis collected by photon absorption, to reaction centers where the energy is used\nto drive chemical reactions. In the photosynthetic bacteria Chlorobaculum\ntepidum (Cba. tepidum), a member of the green sulphur bacteria (GSB) family,\nlight is absorbed by large antenna complexes called chlorosomes. The exciton\ngenerated is transferred to a protein baseplate attached to the chlorosome,\nbefore traveling through the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex to the reaction\ncenter. The energy levels of these systems are generally defined by their\nchemical structure. Here we show that by placing bacteria within a photonic\nmicrocavity, we can access the strong exciton-photon coupling regime between a\nconfined cavity mode and exciton states of the chlorosome, whereby a coherent\nexchange of energy between the bacteria and cavity mode results in the\nformation of polariton states. The polaritons have an energy distinct from that\nof the exciton and photon, and can be tuned in situ via the microcavity length.\nThis results in real-time, non-invasive control over the relative energy levels\nwithin the bacteria. This demonstrates the ability to strongly influence living\nbiological systems with photonic structures such as microcavities. We believe\nthat by creating polariton states, that are in this case a superposition of a\nphoton and excitons within a living bacteria, we can modify energy transfer\npathways and therefore study the importance of energy level alignment on the\nefficiency of photosynthetic systems.\n", "  In this article we explore the critical end point in the $T-\\mu$ phase\ndiagram of a thermomagnetic nonlocal Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model in the weak\nfield limit. We work with the Gaussian regulator, and find that a crossover\ntakes place at $\\mu, B=0$. The crossover turns to a first order phase\ntransition as the chemical potential or the magnetic field increase. The\ncritical end point of the phase diagram occurs at a higher temperature and\nlower chemical potential as the magnetic field increases. This result is in\naccordance to similar findings in other effective models. We also find there is\na critical magnetic field, for which a first order phase transition takes place\neven at $\\mu=0$.\n", "  We report on a recent result concerning the effective dynamics for a mixture\nof Bose-Einstein condensates, a class of systems much studied in physics and\nreceiving a large amount of attention in the recent literature in mathematical\nphysics; for such models, the effective dynamics is described by a coupled\nsystem of non-linear Sch\\\"odinger equations. After reviewing and commenting our\nproof in the mean field regime from a previous paper, we collect the main\ndetails needed to obtain the rigorous derivation of the effective dynamics in\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii scaling limit.\n", "  We examine the effect of carrier localization due to random alloy\nfluctuations on the radiative and Auger recombination rates in InGaN quantum\nwells as a function of alloy composition, crystal orientation, carrier density,\nand temperature. Our results show that alloy fluctuations reduce individual\ntransition matrix elements by the separate localization of electrons and holes,\nbut this effect is overcompensated by the additional transitions enabled by\ntranslational symmetry breaking and the resulting lack of momentum\nconservation. Hence, we find that localization increases both radiative and\nAuger recombination rates, but that Auger recombination rates increase by one\norder of magnitude more than radiative rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nlocalization has an overall detrimental effect on the efficiency-droop and\ngreen-gap problems of InGaN LEDs.\n", "  The transport properties of nanostructured systems are deeply affected by the\ngeometry of the effective connections to metallic leads. In this work we derive\na conductance expression for interacting systems whose connectivity geometries\ndo not meet the Meir-Wingreen proportional coupling condition. As an\ninteresting application, we consider a quantum dot connected coherently to\ntunable electronic cavity modes. The structure is shown to exhibit a\nwell-defined Kondo effect over a wide range of coupling strengths between the\ntwo subsystems. In agreement with recent experimental results, the calculated\nconductance curves exhibit strong modulations and asymmetric behavior as\ndifferent cavity modes are swept through the Fermi level. These conductance\nmodulations occur, however, while maintaining robust Kondo singlet correlations\nof the dot with the electronic reservoir, a direct consequence of the lopsided\nnature of the device.\n", "  We explore the nature of the metal-insulator transition in\n$\\beta^{\\prime\\prime}$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$Hg(SCN)$_{2}$Cl by x-ray, electrical\ntransport, ESR, Raman and infrared investigations. Magnetic and vibrational\nspectroscopy concurrently reveal a gradual dimerization along the stacking\ndirection $a$, setting in already at the crossover temperature of 150K from the\nmetallic to the insulating state. A spin gap $\\Delta_\\sigma = 47$meV is\nextracted. From the activated resistivity behavior below 55K a charge gap\n$\\Delta_\\rho=60$meV is derived. At $T_{\\rm CO} = 72$K the C=C vibrational modes\nreveal the development of a charge-ordered state with a charge\ndisproportionation of $2\\delta_{\\rho}=0.34e$\n", "  We study the structure of stationary non equilibrium states for interacting\nparticle systems from a microscopic viewpoint. In particular we discuss two\ndifferent discrete geometric constructions. We apply both of them to determine\nnon reversible transition rates corresponding to a fixed invariant measure. The\nfirst one uses the equivalence of this problem with the construction of\ndivergence free flows on the transition graph. Since divergence free flows are\ncharacterized by cyclic decompositions we can generate families of models from\nelementary cycles on the configuration space. The second construction is a\nfunctional discrete Hodge decomposition for translational covariant discrete\nvector fields. According to this, for example, the instantaneous current of any\ninteracting particle system on a finite torus can be canonically decomposed in\na gradient part, a circulation term and an harmonic component. All the three\ncomponents are associated to functions on the configuration space. This\ndecomposition is unique and constructive. The stationary condition can be\ninterpreted as an orthogonality condition with respect to an harmonic discrete\nvector field and we use this decomposition to construct models having a fixed\ninvariant measure.\n", "  Atomically thin PtSe2 films have attracted extensive research interests for\npotential applications in high-speed electronics, spintronics and\nphotodetectors. Obtaining high quality, single crystalline thin films with\nlarge size is critical. Here we report the first successful layer-by-layer\ngrowth of high quality PtSe2 films by molecular beam epitaxy. Atomically thin\nfilms from 1 ML to 22 ML have been grown and characterized by low-energy\nelectron diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy.\nMoreover, a systematic thickness dependent study of the electronic structure is\nrevealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and helical spin\ntexture is revealed by spin-ARPES. Our work provides new opportunities for\ngrowing large size single crystalline films for investigating the physical\nproperties and potential applications of PtSe2.\n", "  We give a microscopic derivation of time-dependent correlation functions of\nthe $1D$ cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (NLS) from many-body quantum\ntheory. The starting point of our proof is our previous work on the\ntime-independent problem and work of the second author on the corresponding\nproblem on a finite lattice. An important new obstacle in our analysis is the\nneed to work with a cutoff in the number of particles, which breaks the\nGaussian structure of the free quantum field and prevents the use of the Wick\ntheorem. We overcome it by the means of complex analytic methods. Our methods\napply to the nonlocal NLS with bounded convolution potential. In the periodic\nsetting, we also consider the local NLS, arising from short-range interactions\nin the many-body setting. To that end, we need the dispersion of the NLS in the\nform of periodic Strichartz estimates in $X^{s,b}$ spaces.\n", "  We derive in the Heisenberg picture a widely used phenomenological coupling\nelement to treat feedback effects in quantum optical platforms. Our derivation\nis based on a microscopic Hamiltonian, which describes the mirror-emitter\ndynamics based on a dielectric, a mediating fully quantized electromagnetic\nfield, and a single two-level system in front of the dielectric. The dielectric\nis modeled as a a system of identical two-state atoms. The Heisenberg equation\nyields a system of describing differential operator equations, which we solve\nin the Weisskopf-Wigner limit. Due to a finite round-trip time between emitter\nand dielectric, we yield delay differential operator equations. Our derivation\nmotivates and justifies the typical phenomenological assumed coupling element\nand allows, furthermore, a generalization to a variety of mirrors, such as\ndissipative mirrors or mirrors with gain dynamics.\n", "  We explore how to study dynamical interactions between brain regions using\nfunctional multilayer networks whose layers represent the different frequency\nbands at which a brain operates. Specifically, we investigate the consequences\nof considering the brain as a multilayer network in which all brain regions can\ninteract with each other at different frequency bands, instead of as a\nmultiplex network, in which interactions between different frequency bands are\nonly allowed within each brain region and not between them. We study the second\nsmallest eigenvalue of the combinatorial supra-Laplacian matrix of the\nmultilayer network in detail, and we thereby show that the heterogeneity of\ninterlayer edges and, especially, the fraction of missing edges crucially\nmodify the spectral properties of the multilayer network. We illustrate our\nresults with both synthetic network models and real data sets obtained from\nresting state magnetoencephalography. Our work demonstrates an important issue\nin the construction of frequency-based multilayer brain networks.\n", "  We study scrambling, an avatar of chaos, in a weakly interacting metal in the\npresence of random potential disorder. It is well known that charge and heat\nspread via diffusion in such an interacting disordered metal. In contrast, we\nshow within perturbation theory that chaos spreads in a ballistic fashion. The\nsquared anticommutator of the electron field operators inherits a light-cone\nlike growth, arising from an interplay of a growth (Lyapunov) exponent that\nscales as the inelastic electron scattering rate and a diffusive piece due to\nthe presence of disorder. In two spatial dimensions, the Lyapunov exponent is\nuniversally related at weak coupling to the sheet resistivity. We are able to\ndefine an effective temperature-dependent butterfly velocity, a speed limit for\nthe propagation of quantum information, that is much slower than microscopic\nvelocities such as the Fermi velocity and that is qualitatively similar to that\nof a quantum critical system with a dynamical critical exponent $z > 1$.\n", "  We report on the investigation of $\\Delta$(1232) production and decay in\nproton-proton collisions at a kinetic energy of 1.25 GeV measured with HADES.\nExclusive dilepton decay channels $ppe^{+}e^{-}$ and $ppe^{+}e^{-}\\gamma$ have\nbeen studied and compared with the partial wave analysis of the hadronic\n$pp\\pi^{0}$ channel. They allow to access both $\\Delta^+ \\to\np\\pi^0(e^+e^-\\gamma)$ and $\\Delta^+ \\to pe^+e^-$ Dalitz decay channels. The\nperfect reconstruction of the well known $\\pi^0$ Dalitz decay serves as a proof\nof the consistency of the analysis. The $\\Delta$ Dalitz decay is identified for\nthe first time and the sensitivity to N-$\\Delta$ transition form factors is\ntested. The $\\Delta$(1232) Dalitz decay branching ratio is also determined for\nthe first time; our result is (4.19 $\\pm$ 0.62 syst. $\\pm$ 0.34 stat.) $\\times\n$ 10$^{-5}$, albeit with some model dependence.\n", "  We report on the investigation of dielectron production in tagged quasi-free\nneutron-proton collisions by using a deuteron beam of kinetic energy 1.25 GeV/u\ninpinging on a liquid hydrogen target. Our measurements with HADES confirm a\nsignificant excess of $e^+e^-$ pairs above the $\\pi^{0}$ mass in the exclusive\nchannel $dp \\to npe^{+}e^{-}(p_{spect})$ as compared to the exclusive channel\n$ppe^{+}e^{-}$ measured in proton-proton collisions at the same energy. That\nexcess points to different bremsstrahlung production mechanisms. Two models\nwere evaluated for the role of the charged pion exchange between nucleons and\ndouble-$\\Delta$ excitation combined with intermediate $\\rho$-meson production.\nDifferential cross sections as a function of the $e^+e^-$ invariant mass and of\nthe angles of the virtual photon, proton and electrons provide valuable\nconstraints and encourage further investigations on both experimental and\ntheoretical side.\n", "  When a charged particle encircles around an Alice string, it changes the sign\nof the electric charge. In this paper we find a BPS-saturated Alice string in\n$U(1)\\times SO(3)$ gauge theory with charged complex scalar fields belonging to\nthe vector representation. After performing BPS completion we solve the BPS\nequations numerically. We further embed the Alice string into an ${\\cal N}=1$\nsupersymmetric gauge theory to show that it is half BPS.\n", "  Trapped-ion quantum platforms are subject to `anomalous' heating due to\ninteractions with electric-field noise sources of nature not yet completely\nknown. There is ample experimental evidence that this noise originates at the\nsurfaces of the trap electrodes, and models assuming fluctuating point-like\ndipoles are consistent with observations, but the exact microscopic mechanisms\nbehind anomalous heating remain undetermined. Here we show how a two-ion probe\ndisplays a transition in its dissipation properties, enabling experimental\naccess to the mean orientation of the dipoles and the spatial extent of\ndipole-dipole correlations. This information can be used to test the validity\nof candidate microscopic models, which predict correlation lengths spanning\nseveral orders of mag- nitude. Furthermore, we propose an experiment to measure\nthese effects with currently-available traps and techniques.\n", "  A strained graphene monolayer is shown to operate as a highly efficient\nquantum heat engine delivering maximum power. The efficiency and power of the\nproposed device exceeds that of recent proposals. The reason for these\nexcellent characteristics is that strain enables complete valley separation in\ntransmittance through the device, implying that increasing strain leads to very\nhigh Seebeck coefficient as well as lower conductance. In addition, since\ntime-reversal symmetry is unbroken in our system, the proposed strained\ngraphene quantum heat engine can also act as a high performance refrigerator.\n", "  We present a three-dimensional Ising model where lines of equal spins are\nfrozen in such that they form an ordered framework structure. The frame spins\nimpose an external field on the rest of the spins (active spins). We\ndemonstrate that this \"porous Ising model\" can be seen as a minimal model for\ncondensation transitions of gas molecules in metal-organic frameworks. Using\nMonte Carlo simulation techniques, we compare the phase behavior of a porous\nIsing model with that of a particle-based model for the condensation of methane\n(CH$_4$) in the isoreticular metal-organic framework IRMOF-16. For both models,\nwe find a line of first-order phase transitions that end in a critical point.\nWe show that the critical behavior in both cases belongs to the 3D Ising\nuniversality class, in contrast to other phase transitions in confinement such\nas capillary condensation.\n", "  Many enhanced sampling methods, such as Umbrella Sampling, Metadynamics or\nVariationally Enhanced Sampling, rely on the identification of appropriate\ncollective variables. For proteins, even small ones, finding appropriate\ncollective variables has proven challenging. Here we suggest that the NMR $S^2$\norder parameter can be used to this effect. We trace the validity of this\nstatement to the suggested relation between $S^2$ and entropy. Using the $S^2$\norder parameter and a surrogate for the protein enthalpy in conjunction with\nMetadynamics or Variationally Enhanced Sampling we are able to reversibly fold\nand unfold a small protein and draw its free energy at a fraction of the time\nthat is needed in unbiased simulations. From a more conceptual point of view\nthis implies describing folding as a resulting from a trade off between entropy\nand enthalpy. We also use $S^2$ in combination with the free energy flooding\nmethod to compute the unfolding rate of this peptide. We repeat this\ncalculation at different temperatures to obtain the unfolding activation\nenergy.\n", "  We analyze the properties of order parameters measuring synchronization and\nphase locking in complex oscillator networks. First, we review network order\nparameters previously introduced and reveal several shortcomings: none of the\nintroduced order parameters capture all transitions from incoherence over phase\nlocking to full synchrony for arbitrary, finite networks. We then introduce an\nalternative, universal order parameter that accurately tracks the degree of\npartial phase locking and synchronization, adapting the traditional definition\nto account for the network topology and its influence on the phase coherence of\nthe oscillators. We rigorously proof that this order parameter is strictly\nmonotonously increasing with the coupling strength in the phase locked state,\ndirectly reflecting the dynamic stability of the network. Furthermore, it\nindicates the onset of full phase locking by a diverging slope at the critical\ncoupling strength. The order parameter may find applications across systems\nwhere different types of synchrony are possible, including biological networks\nand power grids.\n", "  We analyze the problem of quantum phase estimation where the set of allowed\nphases forms a discrete $N$ element subset of the whole $[0,2\\pi]$ interval,\n$\\varphi_n = 2\\pi n/N$, $n=0,\\dots N-1$ and study the discrete-to-continuous\ntransition $N\\rightarrow\\infty$ for various cost functions as well as the\nmutual information. We also analyze the relation between the problems of phase\ndiscrimination and estimation by considering a step cost functions of a given\nwidth $\\sigma$ around the true estimated value. We show that in general a\ndirect application of the theory of covariant measurements for a discrete\nsubgroup of the $U(1)$ group leads to suboptimal strategies due to an implicit\nrequirement of estimating only the phases that appear in the prior\ndistribution. We develop the theory of sub-covariant measurements to remedy\nthis situation and demonstrate truly optimal estimation strategies when\nperforming transition from a discrete to the continuous phase estimation\nregime.\n", "  We present an expression for the gravitational self-force correction to the\ngeodetic spin precession of a spinning compact object with small, but\nnon-negligible mass in a bound, equatorial orbit around a Kerr black hole. We\nconsider only conservative back-reaction effects due to the mass of the compact\nobject ($m_1$) thus neglecting the effects of its spin $s_1$ on its motion,\ni.e, we impose $s_1 \\ll G m_1^2/c$ and $m_1 \\ll m_2$, where $m_2$ is the mass\nparameter of the background Kerr spacetime. We encapsulate the correction to\nthe spin precession in $\\psi$, the ratio of the accumulated spin-precession\nangle to the total azimuthal angle over one radial orbit in the equatorial\nplane. Our formulation considers the gauge-invariant $\\ord(m_1)$ part of the\ncorrection to $\\psi$, denoted by $\\Delta\\psi$, and is a generalization of the\nresults of [Class. Quan. Grav., 34, 084001 (2017)] to Kerr spacetime.\nAdditionally, we compute the zero-eccentricity limit of $\\Delta\\psi$ and show\nthat this quantity differs from the circular-orbit $\\Delta\\psi^\\text{circ}$ by\na gauge-invariant quantity containing the gravitational self-force correction\nto general relativistic periapsis advance in Kerr spacetime. Our result for\n$\\Delta\\psi$ is expressed in a manner that readily accommodates\nnumerical/analytical self-force computations, e.g., in radiation gauge, and\npaves the way for the computation of a new eccentric-orbit Kerr gauge invariant\nbeyond the generalized redshift.\n", "  The analytic specifications of photonic lattices with fractional revival (FR)\nand perfect state transfer (PST) are reviewed. The approach to their design\nwhich is based on orthogonal polynomials is highlighted. A compendium of\nanalytic models with PST is offered. New results on their FR properties are\nincluded. The nearest-neighbour approximation is adopted in most of the review;\none analytic example with next-to-nearest neighbour interactions is also\npresented.\n", "  Based on ab initio evolutionary crystal structure search computation, we\nreport a new phase of phosphorus called green phosphorus ({\\lambda}-P), which\nexhibits the direct band gaps ranging from 0.7 to 2.4 eV and the strong\nanisotropy in optical and transport properties. Free energy calculations show\nthat a single-layer form, termed green phosphorene, is energetically more\nstable than blue phosphorene and a phase transition from black to green\nphosphorene can occur at temperatures above 87 K. Due to its buckled structure,\ngreen phosphorene can be synthesized on corrugated metal surfaces rather than\nclean surfaces.\n", "  The Milky Way and a significant fraction of galaxies are observed to host a\ncentral Massive Black Hole (MBH) embedded in a non-spherical nuclear star\ncluster. We study the secular orbital evolution of compact-object binaries in\nthese environments and characterize the excitation of extremely large\neccentricities that can lead to mergers by gravitational radiation. We find\nthat the eccentricity excitation occurs most efficiently when the nodal\nprecession timescale of the binary's orbit around the MBH due to the\nnon-spherical cluster becomes comparable (within a factor of ~10) to the\ntimescale on which the binary is torqued by the MBH due to the Lidov-Kozai (LK)\nmechanism. We show that in this regime the perturbations due to the cluster\nincrease the fraction of systems that reach extreme eccentricities\n($1-e\\sim10^{-4}-10^{-6}$) by a factor of ~10-100 compared to the idealized\ncase of a spherical cluster, increasing the merger rates of compact objects by\na similar factor. We identify two main channels that lead to this extreme\neccentricity excitation: (i) chaotic diffusion of the eccentricities due to\nresonance overlap; (ii) cluster-driven variations of the mutual inclinations\nbetween the binary orbit and its center-of-mass orbit around the MBH, which can\nintensify the LK oscillations. We estimate that our mechanism can produce black\nhole-black hole and black hole-neutron star binary merger rates of up to\n$\\approx 15$ $\\rm{Gpc}^{-3}yr^{-1}$ and $\\approx 0.4$ $\\rm{Gpc}^{-3}yr^{-1}$,\nrespectively. Thus, we propose the cluster-enhanced Lidov-Kozai mechanism as a\nnew channel for the merger of compact-object binaries, competing with scenarios\nthat invoke isolated binary evolution or dynamical formation in globular\nclusters.\n", "  It is shown that the concept of topological phase transitions can be used to\ndesign nonlinear photonic structures exhibiting power thresholds and\ndiscontinuities in their transmittance. This provides a novel route to devising\nnonlinear optical isolators. We study three representative designs: (i) a\nwaveguide array implementing a nonlinear 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model,\n(ii) a waveguide array implementing a nonlinear 2D Haldane model, and (iii) a\n2D lattice of coupled-ring waveguides. In the first two cases, we find a\ncorrespondence between the topological transition of the underlying linear\nlattice and the power threshold of the transmittance, and show that the\ntransmission behavior is attributable to the emergence of a self-induced\ntopological soliton. In the third case, we show that the topological transition\nproduces a discontinuity in the transmittance curve, which can be exploited to\nachieve sharp jumps in the power-dependent isolation ratio.\n", "  The physics of excitons, electron-hole pairs that are bound together by their\nmutual Coulomb attraction, can to great extent be understood in the framework\nof the quantum-mechanical hydrogen model. This model has recently been\nchallenged by spectroscopic measurements on two-dimensional transition-metal\ndichalchogenides that unveil strong deviations from a hydrogenic spectrum.\nHere, we show that this deviation is due to the particular relativistic\ncharacter of electrons in this class of materials. Indeed, their electrons are\nno longer described in terms of a Schroedinger but a massive Dirac equation\nthat intimately links electrons to holes. Dirac excitons therefore inherit a\nrelativistic quantum spin-1/2 that contributes to the angular momentum and thus\nthe exciton spectrum. Most saliently, the level spacing is strongly reduced as\ncompared to the hydrogen model, in agreement with spectroscopic measurements\nand ab-initio calculations.\n", "  Nanoantennas for highly efficient excitation and manipulation of surface\nwaves at nanoscale are key elements of compact photonic circuits. However,\npreviously implemented designs employ plasmonic nanoantennas with high Ohmic\nlosses, relatively low spectral resolution, and complicated lithographically\nmade architectures. Here we propose an ultracompact and simple dielectric\nnanoantenna (silicon nanosphere) allowing for both directional launching of\nsurface plasmon polaritons on a thin gold film and their demultiplexing with a\nhigh spectral resolution. We show experimentally that mutual interference of\nmagnetic and electric dipole moments supported by the dielectric nanoantenna\nresults in opposite propagation of the excited surface waves whose wavelengths\ndiffer by less than 50 nm in the optical range. Broadband reconfigurability of\nthe nanoantennas operational range is achieved simply by varying the diameter\nof the silicon sphere. Moreover, despite subwavelength size ($<\\lambda/3$) of\nthe proposed nanoantennas, they demonstrate highly efficient and directional\nlaunching of surface waves both in the forward and backward directions with the\nmeasured front-to-back ratio having a contrast of almost two orders of\nmagnitude within a 50 nm spectral band. Our lithography-free design has great\npotential as highly efficient, low-cost, and ultracompact demultiplexer for\nadvanced photonic circuits.\n", "  The In-doped topological crystalline insulator Sn_{1-x}In_xTe is a candidate\nfor a topological superconductor, where pseudo-spin-triplet state has been\nproposed. To clarify the spin symmetry of Sn_{1-x}In_xTe, we perform\n^{125}Te-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in polycrystalline\nsamples with 0< x <0.15. The penetration depth calculated from the NMR line\nwidth is T-independent below half the superconducting transition temperature\n(T_c) in polycrystalline Sn_{0.96}In_{0.04}Te, which indicates a fully-opened\nsuperconducting gap. In this sample, the spin susceptibility measured by the\nspin Knight shift (K_s) at an external magnetic field of H_0 = 0.0872 T\ndecreases below T_c, and K_s(T=0)/K_s(T=T_c) reaches to 0.36 \\pm 0.10, which is\nfar below the limiting value 2/3 expected for a spin-triplet state for a cubic\ncrystal structure. Our result indicates that polycrystalline\nSn_{0.96}In_{0.04}Te is a spin-singlet superconductor.\n", "  We combine state-of-the-art models for the production of stellar radiation\nand its transfer through the interstellar medium (ISM) to investigate\nultraviolet-line diagnostics of stars, the ionized and the neutral ISM in\nstar-forming galaxies. We start by assessing the reliability of our stellar\npopulation synthesis modelling by fitting absorption-line indices in the\nISM-free ultraviolet spectra of 10 Large-Magellanic-Cloud clusters. In doing\nso, we find that neglecting stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass\nfunction in these young ($\\sim10$-100 Myr), low-mass clusters affects\nnegligibly ultraviolet-based age and metallicity estimates but can lead to\nsignificant overestimates of stellar mass. Then, we proceed and develop a\nsimple approach, based on an idealized description of the main features of the\nISM, to compute in a physically consistent way the combined influence of\nnebular emission and interstellar absorption on ultraviolet spectra of\nstar-forming galaxies. Our model accounts for the transfer of radiation through\nthe ionized interiors and outer neutral envelopes of short-lived stellar birth\nclouds, as well as for radiative transfer through a diffuse intercloud medium.\nWe use this approach to explore the entangled signatures of stars, the ionized\nand the neutral ISM in ultraviolet spectra of star-forming galaxies. We find\nthat, aside from a few notable exceptions, most standard ultraviolet indices\ndefined in the spectra of ISM-free stellar populations are prone to significant\ncontamination by the ISM, which increases with metallicity. We also identify\nseveral nebular-emission and interstellar-absorption features, which stand out\nas particularly clean tracers of the different phases of the ISM.\n", "  We consider the nonequilibrium protocol where two semi-infinite gapped XXZ\nchains, initially prepared in different equilibrium states, are suddenly joint\ntogether. At large times, a generalized hydrodynamic description applies,\naccording to which the system can locally be represented by space- and time-\ndependent stationary states. The magnetization displays an unusual behavior:\ndepending on the initial state, its profile may exhibit abrupt jumps that can\nnot be predicted directly from the standard hydrodynamic equations and which\nsignal non-ballistic spin transport. We ascribe this phenomenon to the\nstructure of the local conservation laws and make a prediction for the exact\nlocation of the jumps. We find that the jumps propagate at the velocities of\nthe heaviest quasiparticles. By means of tDMRG simulations we show that our\ntheory yields a complete description of the long-time steady profiles of\nconserved charges, currents, and local correlations.\n", "  Recent advances in knot polynomial calculus allowed us to obtain a huge\nvariety of LMOV integers counting degeneracy of the BPS spectrum of topological\ntheories on the resolved conifold and appearing in the genus expansion of the\nplethystic logarithm of the Ooguri-Vafa partition functions. Already the very\nfirst look at this data reveals that the LMOV numbers are randomly distributed\nin genus (!) and are very well parameterized by just three parameters depending\non the representation, an integer and the knot. We present an accurate\nformulation and evidence in support of this new puzzling observation about the\nold puzzling quantities. It probably implies that the BPS states, counted by\nthe LMOV numbers can actually be composites made from some still more\nelementary objects.\n", "  While there exist a wide range of effective methods for community detection\nin networks, most of them require one to know in advance how many communities\none is looking for. Here we present a method for estimating the number of\ncommunities in a network using a combination of Bayesian inference with a novel\nprior and an efficient Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We test the method\nextensively on both real and computer-generated networks, showing that it\nperforms accurately and consistently, even in cases where groups are widely\nvarying in size or structure.\n", "  We present a complete symmetry classification of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK)\nmodel with $\\mathcal{N}=0$, $1$ and $2$ supersymmetry (SUSY) on the basis of\nthe Altland-Zirnbauer scheme in random matrix theory (RMT). For $\\mathcal{N}=0$\nand $1$ we consider generic $q$-body interactions in the Hamiltonian and find\nRMT classes that were not present in earlier classifications of the same model\nwith $q=4$. We numerically establish quantitative agreement between the\ndistributions of the smallest energy levels in the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SYK model\nand RMT. Furthermore, we delineate the distinctive structure of the\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK model and provide its complete symmetry classification\nbased on RMT for all eigenspaces of the fermion number operator. We corroborate\nour classification by detailed numerical comparisons with RMT and thus\nestablish the presence of quantum chaotic dynamics in the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK\nmodel. We also introduce a new SYK-like model without SUSY that exhibits hybrid\nproperties of the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK models and uncover\nits rich structure both analytically and numerically.\n", "  Heartbeat stars are eccentric binary stars in short period orbits whose light\ncurves are shaped by tidal distortion, reflection, and Doppler beaming. Some\nheartbeat stars exhibit tidally excited oscillations and present new\nopportunities for understanding the physics of tidal dissipation within stars.\nWe present detailed methods to compute the forced amplitudes, frequencies, and\nphases of tidally excited oscillations in eccentric binary systems. Our methods\ni) factor out the equilibrium tide for easier comparison with observations, ii)\naccount for rotation using the traditional approximation, iii) incorporate\nnon-adiabatic effects to reliably compute surface luminosity perturbations, iv)\nallow for spin-orbit misalignment, and v) correctly sum over contributions from\nmany oscillation modes. We also discuss why tidally excited oscillations are\nmore visible in hot stars with surface temperatures $T \\! \\gtrsim \\! 6500 \\,\n{\\rm K}$, and we derive some basic probability theory that can be used to\ncompare models with data in a statistical manner. Application of this theory to\nheartbeat systems can be used to determine whether observed tidally excited\noscillations can be explained by chance resonances with stellar oscillation\nmodes, or whether a resonance locking process is operating.\n", "  We construct algebra with noncommutativity of coordinates and\nnoncommutativity of momenta which is rotationally invariant and equivalent to\nnoncommutative algebra of canonical type. Influence of noncommutativity on the\nenergy levels of hydrogen atom is studied in rotationally invariant\nnoncommutative phase space. We find corrections to the levels up to the second\norder in the parameters of noncommutativity and estimate the upper bounds of\nthese parameters.\n", "  In order to solve the problems of waveform distortion and signal delay by\nmany physical and electrical systems with multi-pole linear low-pass transfer\ncharacteristics, a simple digital-signal-processing (DSP)-based method of\nreal-time recovery of the original source waveform from the distorted output\nwaveform is proposed. A mathematical analysis on the convolution kernel\nrepresentation of the single-pole low-pass transfer function shows that the\noriginal source waveform can be accurately recovered in real time using a\nparticular moving average algorithm applied on the input stream of the\ndistorted waveform, which can also significantly reduce the overall delay time\nconstant. This method is generalized for multi-pole low-pass systems and has\nnoise characteristics of the inverse of the low-pass filter characteristics.\nThis method can be applied to most sensors and amplifiers operating close to\ntheir frequency response limits to improve the overall performances of data\nacquisition systems and digital feedback control systems.\n", "  Parameters that quantify the acceleration of cosmic expansion are\nconventionally determined within the standard\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model, which fixes spatial curvature\nto be homogeneous. Generic averages of Einstein's equations in inhomogeneous\ncosmology lead to models with non-rigidly evolving average spatial curvature,\nand different parametrizations of apparent cosmic acceleration. The timescape\ncosmology is a viable example of such a model without dark energy. Using the\nlargest available supernova data set, the JLA catalogue, we find that the\ntimescape model fits the luminosity distance-redshift data with a likelihood\nthat is statistically indistinguishable from the standard spatially flat\n$\\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology by Bayesian comparison. In the timescape\ncase cosmic acceleration is non-zero but has a marginal amplitude, with\nbest-fitting apparent deceleration parameter, $q_0=-0.043^{+0.004}_{-0.000}$.\nSystematic issues regarding standardization of supernova light curves are\nanalysed. Cuts of data at the statistical homogeneity scale affect light curve\nparameter fits independent of cosmology. A cosmological model dependence of\nempirical changes to the mean colour parameter is also found. Irrespective of\nwhich model ultimately fits better, we argue that as a competitive model with a\nnon-FLRW expansion history, the timescape model may prove a useful diagnostic\ntool for disentangling selection effects and astrophysical systematics from the\nunderlying expansion history.\n", "  We study the scattering of photons propagating in a semi-infinite waveguide\nterminated by a mirror and interacting with a quantum emitter. This paradigm\nconstitutes an example of coherent quantum feedback, where light emitted\ntowards the mirror gets redirected back to the emitter. We derive an analytical\nsolution for the scattering of two-photon states, which is based on an exact\nresummation of the perturbative expansion of the scattering matrix, in a regime\nwhere the time delay of the coherent feedback is comparable to the timescale of\nthe quantum emitter's dynamics. We compare the results with numerical\nsimulations based on matrix product state techniques simulating the full\ndynamics of the system, and extend the study to the scattering of coherent\nstates beyond the low-power limit.\n", "  The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE), one of the four scientific space\nscience missions within the framework of the Strategic Pioneer Program on Space\nScience of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is a general purpose high energy\ncosmic-ray and gamma-ray observatory, which was successfully launched on\nDecember 17th, 2015 from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The DAMPE\nscientific objectives include the study of galactic cosmic rays up to $\\sim 10$\nTeV and hundreds of TeV for electrons/gammas and nuclei respectively, and the\nsearch for dark matter signatures in their spectra. In this paper we illustrate\nthe layout of the DAMPE instrument, and discuss the results of beam tests and\ncalibrations performed on ground. Finally we present the expected performance\nin space and give an overview of the mission key scientific goals.\n", "  ASTRONIRCAM is a cryogenic-cooled slit spectrograph for the spectral range\n1-2.5 mkm installed at the Nasmyth focus of the 2.5-meter telescope of the\nCaucasian observatory of Sternberg Astronomical Institute of Lomonosov Moscow\nState University. The instrument is equipped with the HAWAII-2RG 2048x2048\nHgCdTe array. Grisms are used as dispersive elements. In the photometric mode\nASTRONIRCAM allows for extended astronomical object imaging in the field of\nview of 4.6x4.6 arc minutes with the 0.269 arcsec/pixel scale in standard\nphotometric bands J, H, K and Ks as well as in narrow-band filters CH_4, [Fe\nII], H_2 v=1-0 S(1), Br_gamma and CO. In the spectroscopic mode, ASTRONIRCAM\ntakes spectra of extended or point-like sources with spectral resolution\nR=lambda/Delta lambda <= 1200. The general design, optical system, detector\nelectronics and readout, amplification and digitization scheme are considered.\nThe conversion factor GAIN measurement results are described as well as its\ndependence on the accumulated signal (non-linearity). The full transmission of\nthe atmosphere-to-detector train ranges from 40 to 50\\% in the wide-band\nphotometry mode. The ASTRONIRCAM sensitivity at the 2.5-m telescope is\ncharacterized by the limiting J=20, K=19 star magnitudes measured with the 10%\nprecision and 15 minutes integration at the 1 arcsec atmospheric seeing\nconditions. The references to first results published on the base of\nASTRONIRCAM observations are given.\n", "  We present a time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group\ninvestigation of the quantum distillation process within the Fermi--Hubbard\nmodel on a quasi-1D ladder geometry. The term distillation refers to the\ndynamical, spatial separation of singlons and doublons in the sudden expansion\nof interacting particles in an optical lattice, i.e., the release of a cloud of\natoms from a trapping potential. Remarkably, quantum distillation can lead to a\ncontraction of the doublon cloud, resulting in an increased density of the\ndoublons in the core region compared to the initial state. As a main result, we\nshow that this phenomenon is not limited to chains that were previously\nstudied. Interestingly, there are additional dynamical processes on the two-leg\nladder such as density oscillations and selftrapping of defects that lead to a\nless efficient distillation process. An investigation of the time evolution\nstarting from product states provides an explanation for this behaviour.\nInitial product states are also considered, since in optical lattice\nexperiments such states are often used as the initial setup. We propose\nconfigurations that lead to a fast and efficient quantum distillation.\n", "  We theoretically study the impacts of linear spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between magnetic impurities in two\nkinds of three-dimensional noncentrosymmetric systems. It has been found that\nlinear SOCs lead to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the Ising\ninteraction, in addition to the conventional Heisenberg interaction. These\ninteractions possess distinct range functions from three dimensional electron\ngases and Dirac/Weyl semimetals. In the weak SOC limit, the Heisenberg\ninteraction dominates over the other two interactions in a moderately large\nregion of parameters. Sufficiently strong Rashba SOC makes the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction or the Ising interaction dominate over the\nHeisenberg interaction in some regions. The change in topology of the Fermi\nsurface leads to some quantitative changes in periods of oscillations of range\nfunctions. The anisotropy of Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction in\nbismuth tellurohalides family BiTe$X$ ($X$ = Br, Cl, and I) originates from\nboth the specific form of Rashba SOC and the anisotropic effective mass. Our\nwork provides some insights into understanding observed spin textures and the\napplication of these materials in spintronics.\n", "  The $H_0$-tension problem poses a confrontation of dark energy driving\nlate-time cosmological expansion measured by the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ over\nan extended range of redshifts $z$. Distinct values $H_0\\simeq 73$\nkm\\,s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ and $H_0\\simeq 68$ km\\,s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ obtain from\nsurveys of the Local Universe and, respectively, $\\Lambda$CBM analysis of the\nCMB. These are representative of accelerated expansion with\n$H^\\prime(0)\\simeq0$ by $\\Lambda=\\omega_0^2$ and, respectively, $H^\\prime(0)>0$\nin $\\Lambda$CDM, where $\\omega_0=\\sqrt{1-q}H$ is a fundamental frequency of the\ncosmological horizon in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with deceleration\nparameter $q(z)=-1+(1+z)H^{-1}H^\\prime(z)$. Explicit solutions\n$H(z)=H_0\\sqrt{1+\\omega_m(6z+12z^2+12z^3+6z^4+(6/5)z^5)}$ and, respectively,\n$H(z)=H_0\\sqrt{1-\\omega_m+\\omega_m(1+z)^3}$ are here compared with recent data\non $H(z)$ over $0\\lesssim z \\lesssim2$. The first is found to be free of\ntension with $H_0$ from local surveys, while the latter is disfavored at\n$2.7\\sigma$. A further confrontation obtains in galaxy dynamics by a finite\nsensitivity of inertia to background cosmology in weak gravity, putting an\nupper bound of $m\\lesssim 10^{-30}$eV on the mass of dark matter. A $C^0$ onset\nto weak gravity at the de Sitter scale of acceleration $a_{dS}=cH(z)$, where\n$c$ denotes the velocity of light, can be seen in galaxy rotation curves\ncovering $0\\lesssim z \\lesssim 2$. Weak gravity in galaxy dynamics hereby\nprovides a proxy for cosmological evolution.\n", "  In the paper a study of a model magnetoelastic solid system is presented. The\nsystem of interest is a mean-field magnet with nearest-neighbour ferromagnetic\ninteractions and the underlying s.c. crystalline lattice with the long-range\nMorse interatomic potential and the anharmonic Debye model for the lattice\nvibrations. The influence of the external magnetic field on the thermodynamics\nis investigated, with special emphasis put on the consequences of the\nmagnetoelastic coupling, introduced by the power-law distance dependence of the\nmagnetic exchange integral. Within the fully self-consistent, Gibbs\nenergy-based formalism such thermodynamic quantities as the entropy, the\nspecific heat as well as the lattice and magnetic response functions are\ncalculated and discussed. To complete the picture, the magnetocaloric effect is\ncharacterized by analysis of the isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic\ntemperature change in the presence of the external pressure.\n", "  On July 31st, 2016, the ICECUBE collaboration reported the detection of a\nhigh-energy starting event induced by an astrophysical neutrino. We report here\nabout the search for a gamma-ray counterpart of the ICECUBE-160731 event made\nwith the AGILE satellite. No detection was found spanning the time interval of\n+/- 1 ks around the neutrino event time T0 using the AGILE \"burst search\"\nsystem. Looking for a possible gamma-ray precursor in the results of the\nAGILE-GRID automatic Quick Look procedure over predefined 48-hours time-bins,\nwe found an excess above 100 MeV between one and two days before T0,\npositionally consistent with the ICECUBE error circle, having a post-trial\nsignificance of about 4 sigma. A refined data analysis of this excess confirms\na-posteriori the automatic detection. The new AGILE transient source, named AGL\nJ1418+0008, thus stands as possible ICECUBE-160731 gamma-ray precursor. No\nother space missions nor ground observatories have reported any detection of\ntransient emission consistent with the ICECUBE event. We show that Fermi-LAT\nhad a low exposure of the ICECUBE region during the AGILE gamma-ray transient.\nBased on an extensive search for cataloged sources within the error regions of\nICECUBE-160731 and AGL J1418+0008, we find a possible common counterpart\nshowing some of the key features associated to the high-energy peaked BL Lac\n(HBL) class of blazars. Further investigations on the nature of this source\nusing dedicated SWIFT ToO data are presented.\n", "  A low background double-wall piston-cylinder-type pressure cell is developed\nat the Paul Scherrer Institute. The cell is made from BERLYCO-25 (beryllium\ncopper) and MP35N nonmagnetic alloys with the design and dimensions which are\nspecifically adapted to muon-spin rotation/relaxation (muSR) measurements. The\nmechanical design and performance of the pressure cell are evaluated using\nfinite-element analysis (FEA). By including the measured stress-strain\ncharacteristics of the material into the finite-element model, the cell\ndimensions are optimized with the aim to reach the highest possible pressure\nwhile maintaining the sample space large (6 mm in diameter and 12 mm high). The\npresented unconventional design of the double-wall piston-cylinder pressure\ncell with a harder outer MP35N sleeve and asofter inner CuBe cylinder enables\npressures of up to 2.6 GPa to be reached at ambient temperatures, corresponding\nto 2.2 GPa at low temperatures without any irreversible damage to the pressure\ncell. The nature of the muon stopping distribution, mainly in the sample and in\nthe CuBe cylinder, results in a low-background muSR signal.\n", "  We present the results of a survey for intervening MgII absorbers in the\nredshift range z $\\simeq$2-6 in the foreground of four high redshift quasar\nspectra, 5.79$\\le z_{em}\\le$6.133, obtained with the ESO VLT X-shooter. We\nidentify 24 absorbers at $\\ge 5\\sigma$ significance in the equivalent width\nrange 0.117$\\le W_{2796}\\le 3.655\\unicode{xC5}$ with the highest redshift\nabsorber at $z=4.89031\\pm4\\times10^{-5}$. For weak\n($W_{2796}<0.3\\unicode{xC5}$) systems, we measure an incidence rate\n$dN/dz$=1.35$\\pm$0.58 at <z>=2.34 and find that it almost doubles to\n$dN/dz$=2.58$\\pm$0.67 by <z>=4.81. Weak absorbers exceeds the number expected\nfrom an exponential fit to stronger systems ($W_{2796}>0.3\\unicode{xC5}$). We\nfind that there must be significant evolution in the absorption halo properties\nof MgII absorbers with $W_{2796} >0.1\\unicode{xC5}$ by <z>=4.77 and/or that\nthey are associated with galaxies with luminosities beyond the limits of the\ncurrent luminosity function at z $\\sim$5. We find that the incidence rate of\nstrong MgII absorbers ($W_{2796}>1.0\\unicode{xC5}$) can be explained if they\nare associated with galaxies with $L\\ge0.29L_{\\ast}$ and/or their covering\nfraction increases. If they continue to only be associated with galaxies with\n$L\\ge0.50L_{\\ast}$ then their physical cross section ($\\sigma_{phys}$)\nincreases from 0.015 Mpc$^2$ at z=2.3 to 0.041 Mpc$^2$ at <z>=4.77. We measure\n$\\Omega_{MgII}$=2.1$^{+6.3}_{-0.6}\\times10^{-8}$,\n1.9$^{+2.9}_{-0.2}\\times10^{-8}$, 3.9$^{+7.1}_{-2.4}\\times10^{-7}$ at <z>=2.48,\n3.41, 4.77, respectively. At <z>=4.77, $\\Omega_{MgII}$ exceeds the value\nexpected from $\\Omega_{HI}$ estimated from the global metallicity of DLAs at z\n$\\simeq$4.85 by a factor of $\\sim$44 suggesting that either MgII absorbers\ntrace both ionised and neutral gas and/or are more metal rich than the average\nDLA at this redshift.\n", "  In the present letter, it is demonstrated how full configuration interaction\n(FCI) results in extended basis sets may be obtained to within sub-kJ/mol\naccuracy by decomposing the energy in terms of many-body expansions in the\nvirtual orbitals of the molecular system at hand. This extension of the FCI\napplication range lends itself to two unique features of the current approach,\nnamely that the total energy calculation can be performed entirely within\nconsiderably reduced orbital subspaces and may be so by means of embarrassingly\nparallel programming. Facilitated by a rigorous and methodical screening\nprotocol and further aided by expansion points different from the Hartree-Fock\nsolution, all-electron numerical results are reported for H$_2$O in polarized\ncore-valence basis sets ranging from double-$\\zeta$ (10 $e$, 28 $o$) to\nquadruple-$\\zeta$ (10 $e$, 144 $o$) quality.\n", "  We consider the numerical approximation of stochastic partial differential\nequations (SPDEs) based models for a quasi-periodic climate pattern in the\ntropical Pacific Ocean known as El Ni\\~no phenomenon. We show that for these\nmodels the mean and the covariance are given by a deterministic partial\ndifferential equation and by an operator differential equation, respectively.\nIn this context we provide a numerical framework to approximate these\nparameters directly. We compare this method to stochastic differential\nequations and SPDEs based models from the literature solved by Taylor methods\nand stochastic Galerkin methods, respectively. Numerical results for different\nscenarios taking as a reference measured data of the years 2014 and 2015 (last\nNi\\~no event) validate the efficiency of our approach.\n", "  MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) is a system of two 17 m\ndiameter, F/1.03 Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT). They are\ndedicated to the observation of gamma rays from galactic and extragalactic\nsources in the very high energy range (VHE, 30 GeV to 100 TeV). This submission\ncontains links to the proceedings for the 35th International Cosmic Ray\nConference (ICRC2017), held in Bexco, Busan, Korea from the 12th to the 17th of\nJuly, 2017.\n", "  He accretion onto carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) plays a fundamental\nrole when studying the formation of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Employing the\nMESA stellar evolution code, we calculated the long-term evolution of\nHe-accreting CO WDs. Previous studies usually supposed that a WD can grow in\nmass to the Chandrasekhar limit in the stable He burning region and finally\nproduce a SN Ia. However, in this study we find that off-centre carbon ignition\noccurs in the stable He burning region if the accretion rate is above a\ncritical value (~2.05*10^{-6}{M$_\\odot$}{yr}^-1), resulting in\naccretion-induced collapse rather than a SN Ia. If the accretion rate is below\nthe critical value, explosive carbon ignition will eventually happen in the\ncentre producing a SN Ia. Taking into account the possibility of off-centre\ncarbon ignition, we have re-determined the initial parameter space that\nproduces SNe Ia in the He star donor channel, one of the promising channels to\nproduce SNe Ia in young populations. Since this parameter space is smaller than\nwas found in the previous study of Wang et al. (2009), the SN Ia rates are also\ncorrespondingly smaller. We also determined the chemical abundance profile of\nthe He-accreting WDs at the moment of explosive carbon ignition, which can be\nused as initial input for SN Ia explosion models.\n", "  A tutorial introduction into the principles of Orbital Physics in strongly\ncorrelated transition metal oxides.\n", "  We give a perturbative analysis of Crooks relation and Jarzynski equality in\nan arbitrary driven quantum system weakly coupled to a heat bath. Invoking no\nefficient Hamiltonian nor any restriction on the form of the coupling, we\nderive the first-order correction to Crooks relation and Jarzynski equality in\nterms of the interacting Hamiltonian. A Crooks type of relation about energy\nincrement in the system and nonvanishing heat expenditure to the heat bath up\nto the second order of interaction would be given by the way. Our results tell\nus that deviation of the quantum fluctuation relations is mainly caused by\nenergy trapped interaction rather than the heat flow to (or from) heat bath. We\nalso show a way of defining work in weak coupling regime which is consistent to\nthe work definition in closed systems and thus deepen our understanding of work\nin quantum realm.\n", "  We study the $S$-matrix interpretation of quantum theory in light of\nCategotical Quantum Mechanics. The $S$-matrix interpretation of quantum theory\nis shown to be a functorial semantics relating the algebras of quantum theory\nto the effective $S$-matrix formalism. Consequently, issues such as state\nreduction and entanglement generation can be depicted in a simple manner.\nMoreover, this categorical $S$-matrix interpretation does not have the alleged\nthermodynamic cost.\n", "  Oxygen K-edge X-ray absorption spectra of liquid water are computed based on\nthe configurations from advanced ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, as\nwell as an electron excitation theory from the GW method. One one hand, the\nmolecular structures of liquid water are accurately predicted by including both\nvan der Waals interactions and hybrid functional (PBE0). On the other hand, the\ndynamic screening effects on electron excitation are approximately described by\nthe recently developed enhanced static Coulomb hole and screened exchange\napproximation by Kang and Hybertsen [Phys. Rev. B 82, 195108 (2010)]. The\nresulting spectra of liquid water are in better quantitative agreement with the\nexperimental spectra due to the softened hydrogen bonds and the slightly\nbroadened spectra originating from the better screening model.\n", "  Traditionally, evaluation of intersection safety has been largely reactive,\nbased on historical crash frequency data. However, the emerging data from\nConnected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) can complement historical data and help\nin proactively identify intersections which have high levels of variability in\ninstantaneous driving behaviors prior to the occurrence of crashes. Based on\ndata from Safety Pilot Model Deployment in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this study\ndeveloped a unique database that integrates intersection crash and inventory\ndata with more than 65 million real-world Basic Safety Messages logged by 3,000\nconnected vehicles, providing a more complete picture of operations and safety\nperformance of intersections. As a proactive safety measure and a leading\nindicator of safety, this study introduces location-based volatility (LBV),\nwhich quantifies variability in instantaneous driving decisions at\nintersections. LBV represents the driving performance of connected vehicle\ndrivers traveling through a specific intersection. As such, by using\ncoefficient of variation as a standardized measure of relative dispersion, LBVs\nare calculated for 116 intersections in Ann Arbor. To quantify relationships\nbetween intersection-specific volatilities and crash frequencies, rigorous\nfixed- and random-parameter Poisson regression models are estimated. While\ncontrolling for exposure related factors, the results provide evidence of\nstatistically significant (5% level) positive association between\nintersection-specific volatility and crash frequencies for signalized\nintersections. The implications of the findings for proactive intersection\nsafety management are discussed in the paper.\n", "  Recently, interest in Superconductor (S)-Normal (N) interfaces was renewed by\nthe observation of exotic proximity effects in various systems, including\nS/semiconductor, S/ferromagnet, and S/topological insulator. In general, the\nproximity effect is enhanced in transparent weak links where coherent Andreev\nreflection is possible. Also, it is a common knowledge that the proximity\neffect is, by definition, is a localized phenomenon that can only be active in\neach S/N interface region. However, here we show that a three-dimensional (3D)\nmacroscale proximity effect is realized in few-micrometer-thick MgO/Mg2Si/MgB2\nnanocomposite layers with atomically smooth and clean heterointerfaces. We\nfound from scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)\nmicroscopy measurements that a normal region of more than 100x100 square\nmicrometers totally undergoes transition into a bulk-like superconducting state\nalthough the normal host originally contains less than ~10 vol % of\nsuperconducting MgB2 nanograins in a dispersed manner. In the proximity-induced\nsuperconducting region, vortex formation and annihilation processes as well as\nvortex-free Meissner regions were observed with respect to applied fields in a\nsimilar manner as Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors. Furthermore,\nwe found that the induced superconducting layers exhibit an anisotropic\nmagnetization behavior, in consistent with the formation of the large-scale\nsuperconducting coherence. This unusually extended proximity effect suggests\nthat disorder-induced interaction and coupling of Andreev bound states, which\nare coherent superposition of time reversed electron hole pairs, is realized in\nthe nanocomposite. Thus, the present results not only expand the limit of the\nproximity effect to bulk scales, but also provides a new route to obtain a\nproximity-induced superconducting state from disordered systems.\n", "  A time-dependent dark energy component of the Universe may be able to explain\ntensions between local and primordial measurements of cosmological parameters,\nshaking current confidence in the concept of a cosmological constant.\n", "  As an exoplanet transits its host star, some of the light from the star is\nabsorbed by the atoms and molecules in the planet's atmosphere, causing the\nplanet to seem bigger; plotting the planet's observed size as a function of the\nwavelength of the light produces a transmission spectrum. Measuring the tiny\nvariations in the transmission spectrum, together with atmospheric modelling,\nthen gives clues to the properties of the exoplanet's atmosphere. Chemical\nspecies composed of light elements$-$such as hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, sodium\nand potassium$-$have in this way been detected in the atmospheres of several\nhot giant exoplanets, but molecules composed of heavier elements have thus far\nproved elusive. Nonetheless, it has been predicted that metal oxides such as\ntitanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide occur in the observable regions of the\nvery hottest exoplanetary atmospheres, causing thermal inversions on the\ndayside. Here we report the detection of TiO in the atmosphere of the\nhot-Jupiter planet WASP-19b. Our combined spectrum, with its wide spectral\ncoverage, reveals the presence of TiO (to a confidence level of 7.7{\\sigma}), a\nstrongly scattering haze (7.4{\\sigma}) and sodium (3.4{\\sigma}), and confirms\nthe presence of water (7.9{\\sigma}) in the atmosphere.\n", "  We present an optical eclipse observation of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b using\nthe Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThese spectra allow us to place an upper limit of $A_g < 0.064$ (97.5%\nconfidence level) on the planet's white light geometric albedo across 290--570\nnm. Using six wavelength bins across the same wavelength range also produces\nstringent limits on the geometric albedo for all bins. However, our\nuncertainties in eclipse depth are $\\sim$40% greater than the Poisson limit and\nmay be limited by the intrinsic variability of the Sun-like host star --- the\nsolar luminosity is known to vary at the $10^{-4}$ level on a timescale of\nminutes. We use our eclipse depth limits to test two previously suggested\natmospheric models for this planet: Mie scattering from an aluminum-oxide haze\nor cloud-free Rayleigh scattering. Our stringent nondetection rules out both\nmodels and is consistent with thermal emission plus weak Rayleigh scattering\nfrom atomic hydrogen and helium. Our results are in stark contrast with those\nfor the much cooler HD 189733b, the only other hot Jupiter with spectrally\nresolved reflected light observations; those data showed an increase in albedo\nwith decreasing wavelength. The fact that the first two exoplanets with optical\nalbedo spectra exhibit significant differences demonstrates the importance of\nspectrally resolved reflected light observations and highlights the great\ndiversity among hot Jupiters.\n", "  A long-lived prethermal state may emerge upon a sudden quench of a quantum\nsystem. In this paper, we study a quantum quench of an initial {\\it critical}\nstate, and show that the resulting prethermal state exhibits a genuinely\nquantum and dynamical universal behavior. Specifically, we consider a scenario\nwhere the \"speed of light\" characterizing the propagation of local\nperturbations is suddenly quenched at criticality. We also find that the system\napproaches the prethermal state in a universal way described by a new exponent\nthat characterizes a kind of quantum aging.\n", "  The existence of quantum error correcting codes is one of the most\ncounterintuitive and potentially technologically important discoveries of\nquantum information theory. However, standard error correction refers to\nabstract quantum information, i.e., information that is independent of the\nphysical incarnation of the systems used for storing the information. There\nare, however, other forms of information that are physical - one of the most\nubiquitous being reference frame information. Here we analyze the problem of\nerror correcting physical information. The basic question we seek to answer is\nwhether or not such error correction is possible and, if so, what limitations\ngovern the process. The main challenge is that the systems used for\ntransmitting physical information, in addition to any actions applied to them,\nmust necessarily obey these limitations. Encoding and decoding operations that\nobey a restrictive set of limitations need not exist a priori. We focus on the\ncase of erasure errors, and we first show that the problem is equivalent to\nquantum error correction using group-covariant encodings. We prove a no-go\ntheorem showing that that no finite dimensional, group-covariant quantum codes\nexist for Lie groups with an infinitesimal generator (e.g., U(1), SU(2), and\nSO(3)). We then explain how one can circumvent this no-go theorem using\ninfinite dimensional codes, and we give an explicit example of a covariant\nquantum error correcting code using continuous variables for the group U(1).\nFinally, we demonstrate that all finite groups have finite dimensional codes,\ngiving both an explicit construction and a randomized approximate construction\nwith exponentially better parameters.\n", "  Dibenzo[\\emph{hi,st}]ovalene (DBOV) - a quasi-zero-dimensional `nanographene'\n- displays strong, narrow, and well-defined optical-absorption transitions at\nroom temperature. On placing a DBOV-doped polymer film into an optical\nmicrocavity, we demonstrate strong coupling of the \\textbf{0 $\\rightarrow$ 0'}\nelectronic and \\textbf{0 $\\rightarrow$ 1'} vibrational transitions to a\nconfined cavity mode, with coupling energies of 104 meV and 40 meV,\nrespectively. Photoluminescence measurements indicate that the polariton\npopulation is distributed between the lower and middle polariton branches at\nenergies approximately coincident with the emission of the DBOV, indicating\npolariton population via an optical pumping mechanism.\n", "  The low energy part of the FAST linear accelerator based on 1.3 GHz\nsuperconducting RF cavities was successfully commissioned. During\ncommissioning, beam based model dependent methods were used to correct linear\nlattice and trajectory. Lattice correction algorithm is based on analysis of\nbeam shape from profile monitors and trajectory responses to dipole correctors.\nTrajectory responses to field gradient variations in quadrupoles and phase\nvariations in superconducting RF cavities were used to correct bunch offsets in\nquadrupoles and accelerating cavities relative to their magnetic axes. Details\nof used methods and experimental results are presented.\n", "  Graphite nanofibers (GNFs) have been demonstrated to be a promising material\nfor hydrogen storage and heat management in electronic devices. Here, by means\nof first-principles and transport simulations, we show that GNFs can also be an\nexcellent material for thermoelectric applications thanks to the interlayer\nweak van der Waals interaction that induces low thermal conductance and a\nstep-like shape in the electronic transmission with mini-gaps, which are\nnecessary ingredients to achieve high thermoelectric performance. This study\nunveils that the platelet form of GNFs in which graphite layers are\nperpendicular to the fiber axis can exhibit outstanding thermoelectric\nproperties with a figure of merit ZT reaching 3.55 in a 0.5 nm diameter fiber\nand 1.1 for a 1.1 nm diameter one. Interestingly, by introducing 14C isotope\ndoping, ZT can even be enhanced up to more than 5, and more than 8 if we\ninclude the effect of finite phonon mean-free path, which demonstrates the\namazing thermoelectric potential of GNFs.\n", "  We study the stellar populations of bulges of Milky Way-like (MW-like)\ngalaxies with the aim of identifying the physical processes involved in the\nformation of the bulge of our Galaxy. We use the semi-analytic model of galaxy\nformation and evolution SAG adapted to this aim; this kind of models can trace\nthe properties of galaxies and their components like stellar discs, bulges and\nhalos, but resolution limits prevent them from reaching the scale of stellar\npopulations (SPs). Properties of groups of stars formed during single star\nformation events are stored and tracked in the model and results are compared\nwith observations of stars in the galactic bulge. MW-like galaxies are selected\nusing two different criteria. One of them considers intrinsic photo-metric\nproperties and the second is focused on the cosmological context of the local\ngroup of galaxies (LG). We compare our model results with spectroscopic and\nphotometric stellar metallicity distributions. We find that 87% of stars in\nbulges of MWtype galaxies in our model are accreted and formed in starbursts\nduring disc instability events. Mergers contribute to 13% of the mass budget of\nthe bulge and are responsible for the low metallicity tail of the distribution.\nAbundance ratios of {\\alpha} elements with respect to iron, [{\\alpha}/Fe], are\nmeasured in SPs of model galaxies. The patterns found in the model for SPs with\ndifferent origins help to explain the lack of a gradient of [{\\alpha}/Fe]\nratios in observed stars along the minor axis of the bulge.\n", "  We report measurements of the effective $g$ factor of low-density\ntwo-dimensional holes in a Ge quantum well. Using the temperature dependence of\nthe Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, we extract the effective $g$ factor in a\nmagnetic field perpendicular to the sample surface. Very large values of the\neffective $g$ factor, ranging from $\\sim13$ to $\\sim28$, are observed in the\ndensity range of $1.4\\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ to $1.4\\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$.\nWhen the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the sample surface, the\neffective $g$ factor is obtained from a protrusion in the magneto-resistance\ndata that signifies full spin polarization. In the latter orientation, a small\neffective $g$ factor, $\\sim1.3-1.4$, is measured in the density range of\n$1.5\\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ to $2\\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$. This very strong\nanisotropy is consistent with theoretical predictions and previous measurements\nin other 2D hole systems, such as InGaAs and GaSb.\n", "  These lectures provide an introduction to the physics of particle colliders.\nTopics covered include a quantitative examination of the design and operational\nparameters of Large Hadron Collider, kinematics and observables at colliders,\nsuch as rapidity and transverse mass, and properties of distributions, such as\nJacobian peaks. In addition, the lectures provide a practical introduction to\nthe decay modes and signatures of important composite and elementary and\nparticles in the Standard Model, from pions to the Higgs boson. The aim of\nthese lectures is provide a bridge between theoretical and experimental\nparticle physics. Whenever possible, results are derived using intuitive\narguments and estimates rather than precision calculations.\n", "  Infrared spectrum (IR) of Herbig Ae young stars was reproduced and classified\nby hydrocarbon pentagon-hexagon combined molecules by the quantum chemical\ncalculation. Observed IR list by B. Acke et al. was categorized to four\nclasses. Among 53 Herbig Ae stars, 26 samples show featured IR pattern named\nType-D, which shows common IR peaks at 6.2, 8.3, 9.2, 10.0, 11.3, 12.1, and\n14.0 micrometer. Typical star is HD144432. Calculation on di-cation molecule\n(C12H8)2+ having hydrocarbon one pentagon and two hexagons shows best\ncoincidence at 6.1, 8.2, 9.2, 9.9, 11.3, 12.2, and 14.1 micrometer. There are\nsome variation in Type-D. Spectrum of HD37357 was explained by a mixture with\ndi-cation (C12H8)2+ and tri-cation (C12H8)3+. Ubiquitously observed spectrum\nType-B was observed in 12 samples of Acke's list. In case of HD85567, observed\n16 peaks were precisely reproduced by a single molecule (C23H12)2+. There is a\nmixture case with Type-B and Type-D. Typical example was HD142527. In this\nstudy, we could identify hidden carrier molecules for all types of IR in Herbig\nAe stars.\n", "  In this letter, we introduce stacked fishnet metamaterial for steering light\nin microwave region. We numerically demonstrate that optical Bloch oscillations\nand a focus of as small as one sixth of a wavelength can be achieved. The\nflexibility of varying geometrical parameters of the fishnet slabs provides an\nefficient way for tuning its local effective media parameters and opens the\npossibility for controlling light arbitrarily. The experiment verifies\nsubwavelength-sized light focusing effect by scanning magnetic field at the\nsurface of the sample directly.\n", "  In conventional chemisorption model, the d-band center theory (augmented\nsometimes with the upper edge of d-band for imporved accuarcy) plays a central\nrole in predicting adsorption energies and catalytic activity as a function of\nd-band center of the solid surfaces, but it requires density functional\ncalculations that can be quite costly for large scale screening purposes of\nmaterials. In this work, we propose to use the d-band width of the muffin-tin\norbital theory (to account for local coordination environment) plus\nelectronegativity (to account for adsorbate renormalization) as a simple set of\nalternative descriptors for chemisorption, which do not demand the ab initio\ncalculations. This pair of descriptors are then combined with machine learning\nmethods, namely, artificial neural network (ANN) and kernel ridge regression\n(KRR), to allow large scale materials screenings. We show, for a toy set of 263\nalloy systems, that the CO adsorption energy can be predicted with a remarkably\nsmall mean absolute deviation error of 0.05 eV, a significantly improved result\nas compared to 0.13 eV obtained with descriptors including costly d-band center\ncalculations in literature. We achieved this high accuracy by utilizing an\nactive learning algorithm, without which the accuracy was 0.18 eV otherwise. As\na practical application of this machine, we identified Cu3Y@Cu as a highly\nactive and cost-effective electrochemical CO2 reduction catalyst to produce CO\nwith the overpotential 0.37 V lower than Au catalyst.\n", "  We consider the end states of a half-filled rectangular armchair graphene\nribbon (RAGR) in a staggered potential. Taking electron-electron interactions\ninto account we find that, as the strength of the staggered potential varies,\nthree types of couplings between the end states can occur: antiferromagnetic\nwithout or with spin splitting, and paramagnetic without spin-splitting. We\nfind that a spin-splitting is present only in the staggered potential region\n$0<\\Delta<\\Delta_c$. The transition from the antiferromagnetic state at\n$\\Delta=0$ to the paramagnetic state goes through an intermediate spin-split\nantiferromagnetic state, and this spin-splitting disappears suddenly at\n$\\Delta_c$. For small and large values of $\\Delta$ the end charge of a RAGR can\nbe connected to the Zak phase of the periodic armchair graphene ribbon (PARG)\nwith the same width, and it varies continuously as the strength of the\npotential changes.\n", "  We investigate the effect of cylindrical nano-confinement on the phase\nbehaviour of a rigid model of carbon dioxide using both molecular dynamics and\nwell tempered metadynamics. To this aim we study a simplified pore model across\na parameter space comprising pore diameter, CO2-pore wall potential and CO2\ndensity. In order to systematically identify ordering events within the pore\nmodel we devise a generally applicable approach based on the analysis of the\ndistribution of intermolecular orientations. Our simulations suggest that,\nwhile confinement in nano-pores inhibits the formation of known crystal\nstructures, it induces a remarkable variety of ordered packings unrelated to\ntheir bulk counterparts, and favours the establishment of short range order in\nthe fluid phase. We summarise our findings by proposing a qualitative phase\ndiagram for this model.\n", "  It turns out that the infinite derivative gravity (IDG) is ghost-free and\nrenormalizable when one chooses the exponential of an entire function. For this\nIDG case, the corresponding Newtonian potential generated from the delta\nfunction is non-singular at the origin. However, we will explicitly show that\nthe source generating this non-singular potential is given not by the\ndelta-function due to the point-like source of mass, but by the Gaussian mass\ndistribution. This explains clearly why the IDG with the exponential of an\nentire function yields the finite potential at the origin.\n", "  High-temperature superconducting cuprates are distinguished by an enigmatic\npseudogap which opens near optimal doping where the superconducting transition\ntemperature is highest. Key questions concern its origin and whether it is\nessential in any way to superconductivity. Recent field-induced normal-state\ntransport experiments on hole-doped cuprates have measured abrupt changes in\nthe doping dependent Hall number and resistivity, consistent with a drop in\ncarrier density from $1+p$ to $p$ holes per copper atom, on entering the\npseudogap phase. In this work the change in resistivity is analyzed in terms of\nan antiferromagnetic-order-induced Fermi surface reconstruction model that has\nalready successfully described the Hall number. In order for this model to\ndescribe the resistivity we find that the zero-temperature mean free path must\nalso drop abruptly in proportion to the size of the Fermi surface. This\nsuggests that intrapocket scattering underlies the observed upturn in\nresistivity in the pseudogap state.\n", "  Here, we report the intriguing observation of stable non-volatile resistance\nswitching (NVRS) in single-layer atomic sheets sandwiched between metal\nelectrodes. NVRS is observed in the prototypical semiconducting (MX2, M=Mo, W;\nand X=S, Se) transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and insulating\nhexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), which alludes to the universality of this\nphenomenon in non-metallic 2D monolayers, and features forming-free switching.\nThis observation of NVRS phenomenon, widely attributed to ionic diffusion,\nfilament and interfacial redox in bulk oxides and electrolytes, inspires new\nstudies on defects, ion transport and energetics at the sharp interfaces\nbetween atomically-thin sheets and conducting electrodes. From a contemporary\nperspective, switching is all the more unexpected in monolayers since leakage\ncurrent is a fundamental limit in ultra-thin oxides. Emerging device concepts\nin non-volatile flexible memory fabrics, and brain-inspired (neuromorphic)\ncomputing could benefit substantially from the pervasive NVRS effect and the\nassociated wide materials and engineering co-design opportunity.\nExperimentally, a 50 GHz radio-frequency (RF) monolayer switch is demonstrated,\nwhich opens up a new application for electronic zero-static power RF switching\ntechnology.\n", "  Using an \\textit{ab initio} approach based on the GW approximation which\nincludes strong local \\textbf{k}-space correlations, the Metal-Insulator\nTransition of M$_2$ vanadium dioxide is broken down into its component parts\nand investigated. Similarly to the M$_{1}$ structure, the Peierls pairing of\nthe M$_{2}$ structure results in bonding-antibonding splitting which stabilizes\nstates in which the majority of the charge density resides on the Peierls\nchain. This is insufficient to drop all of the bonding states into the lower\nHubbard band however. An antiferroelectric distortion on the neighboring\nvanadium chain is required to reduce the repulsion felt by the Peierls bonding\nstates by increasing the distances between the vanadium and apical oxygen\natoms, lowering the potential overlap thus reducing the charge density\naccumulation and thereby the electronic repulsion. The antibonding states are\nsimultaneously pushed into the upper Hubbard band. The data indicate that\nsufficiently modified GW calculations are able to describe the interplay of the\natomic and electronic structures occurring in Mott metal-insulator transitions.\n", "  Recently, we have proposed a definition for the vacuum and suggest a\nmechanism for symmetry breaking. In this mechanism extra massless fields,\nvacuum fields, arise. We apply our method to the standard model of particle\nphysics and obtain vacuum sector of this model. Vacuum field of the standard\nmodel is a four-vector with electromagnetic nature. This field is invariant\nunder $ U(1)_{em} $ gauge transformation. We speculate that it could be\nresponsible for many cosmological phenomena like inflation, dark energy and\ncosmic magnetic fields.\n", "  An important and emerging component of planetary exploration is sample\nretrieval and return to Earth. Obtaining and analyzing rock samples can provide\nunprecedented insight into the geology, geo-history and prospects for finding\npast life and water. Current methods of exploration rely on mission scientists\nto identify objects of interests and this presents major operational\nchallenges. Finding objects of interests will require systematic and efficient\nmethods to quickly and correctly evaluate the importance of hundreds if not\nthousands of samples so that the most interesting are saved for further\nanalysis by the mission scientists. In this paper, we propose an automated\ninformation theoretic approach to identify shapes of interests using a library\nof predefined interesting shapes. These predefined shapes maybe human input or\nsamples that are then extrapolated by the shape matching system using the\nSuperformula to judge the importance of newly obtained objects. Shape samples\nare matched to a library of shapes using the eigenfaces approach enabling\ncategorization and prioritization of the sample. The approach shows robustness\nto simulated sensor noise of up to 20%. The effect of shape parameters and\nrotational angle on shape matching accuracy has been analyzed. The approach\nshows significant promise and efforts are underway in testing the algorithm\nwith real rock samples.\n", "  Aboriginal Australians carefully observe the properties and positions of\nstars, including both overt and subtle changes in their brightness, for\nsubsistence and social application. These observations are encoded in oral\ntradition. I examine two Aboriginal oral traditions from South Australia that\ndescribe the periodic changing brightness in three pulsating, red-giant\nvariable stars: Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis), Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri), and\nAntares (Alpha Scorpii). The Australian Aboriginal accounts stand as the only\nknown descriptions of pulsating variable stars in any Indigenous oral tradition\nin the world. Researchers examining these oral traditions over the last\ncentury, including anthropologists and astronomers, missed the description of\nthese stars as being variable in nature as the ethnographic record contained\nseveral misidentifications of stars and celestial objects. Arguably,\nethnographers working on Indigenous Knowledge Systems should have academic\ntraining in both the natural and social sciences.\n", "  We report an experimental investigation of the effect of finite depth on the\nstatistical properties of wave turbulence at the surface of water in the\ngravity-capillary range. We tune the wave dispersion and the level of\nnonlinearity by modifying the depth of water and the forcing respectively. We\nuse space-time resolved profilometry to reconstruct the deformed surface of\nwater. When decreasing the water depth, we observe a drastic transition between\nweak turbulence at the weakest forcing and a solitonic regime at stronger\nforcing. We characterize the transition between both states by studying their\nFourier Spectra. We also study the efficiency of energy transfer in the weak\nturbulence regime. We report a loss of efficiency of angular transfer as the\ndispersion of the wave is reduced until the system bifurcates into the\nsolitonic regime.\n", "  The introduction of magnetic order on the surface of topological insulators\nin general breaks the two-dimensional character of topological surface state\n(TSS). Once the TSS disappears, it is improbable to restore the topological\nsurface properties. In this report, we demonstrate that it is possible to\nrestore the inherent TSS by ultra-high vacuum annealing. Starting from an\nantiferromagnetic Gd-doped Bi2Te3, that has surface state gap without TSS\nproperties, after annealing we observed the gap closing as well as typical TSS\nfeatures in physical properties. The microscopic mechanism of atomic migration\nand TSS restoration by annealing process is unraveled by the combination of\nscanning tunneling microscopy measurements and density functional theory\ncalculations. This approach to control the surface of topological insulators\nand stabilize the TSS simply by vacuum annealing provides a new platform\ntowards the exploitation of their topological properties.\n", "  Silicene and Graphene are similar and have $\\pi$-$\\pi^*$ bands. However band\nwidth in silicene is only a third of graphene. It results in a substantial\nincrease in the ratio of Hubbard U to band width W, U/W $\\sim$ 0.5 in graphene\nto $\\sim 1$ in silicene. This enhancement, 2 dimensionality and phenomenology\nsuggest a Mott insulator based ground state for silicene (G. Baskaran,\narXiv:1309.2242). We lend support to the above proposal by showing, in an\nab-initio calculation, that unlike graphene, silicene has two instabilities: i)\na valence bond (Kekule) dimerization and ii) a weak two sublattice\nantiferromagnetic order. Presence of these instabilities, in the absence of\nfermi surface nesting, point to Mott localization, \\textit{within the frame\nwork of ab-initio scheme}. Substrate dependent structural reconstructions seen\nexperimentally in silicene are interpreted as generalized Kekule bond order.\n", "  During stellar evolution, especially in the PMS, stellar structure and\nrotation evolve significantly causing major changes in the dynamics and global\nflows of the star. We wish to assess the consequences of these changes on\nstellar dynamo, internal magnetic field topology and activity level. To do so,\nwe have performed a series of 3D HD and MHD simulations with the ASH code. We\nchoose five different models characterized by the radius of their radiative\nzone following an evolutionary track computed by a 1D stellar evolution code.\nThese models characterized stellar evolution from 1 Myr to 50 Myr. By\nintroducing a seed magnetic field in the fully convective model and spreading\nits evolved state through all four remaining cases, we observe systematic\nvariations in the dynamical properties and magnetic field amplitude and\ntopology of the models. The five MHD simulations develop strong dynamo field\nthat can reach equipartition state between the kinetic and magnetic energy and\neven super- equipartition levels in the faster rotating cases. We find that the\nmagnetic field amplitude increases as it evolves toward the ZAMS. Moreover the\nmagnetic field topology becomes more complex, with a decreasing axisymmetric\ncomponent and a non-axisymmetric one becoming predominant. The dipolar\ncomponents decrease as the rotation rate and the size of the radiative core\nincrease. The magnetic fields possess a mixed poloidal-toroidal topology with\nno obvious dominant component. Moreover the relaxation of the vestige dynamo\nmagnetic field within the radiative core is found to satisfy MHD stability\ncriteria. Hence it does not experience a global reconfiguration but slowly\nrelaxes by retaining its mixed stable poloidal-toroidal topology.\n", "  The appearance of segregated wurtzite Mg$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$O with low Mg content\nin thin films with $x>0.3$ affected by phase separation, cannot be reliably\nprobed with crystallographic techniques owing to its embedded nanocrystalline\nconfiguration. Here we show a high-pressure approach which exploits the\ndistinctive behaviors under pressure of wurtzite Mg$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$O thin films\nwith different Mg contents to unveil phase segregation for $x>0.3$. By using\nambient conditions photoluminescence (PL), and with optical absorption and PL\nunder high pressure for $x=0.3$ we show that the appearance of a segregated\nwurtzite phase with a magnesium content of x $\\sim$ 0.1 is inherent to the\nwurtzite and rock-salt phase separation. We also show that the presence of\nsegregated wurtzite phase in oversaturated thin films phase is responsible for\nthe low-energy absorption tail observed above $x=0.3$ in our Mg$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$O\nthin films. Our study has also allowed us to extend the concentration\ndependence of the pressure coefficient of the band gap from the previous limit\nof $x$ = 0.13 to $x \\approx 0.3$ obtaining d$E_g$/d$P$ = 29 meV/GPa for\nwurtzite with $x \\approx 0.3$ and 25 meV/GPa for the segregated $x\\approx 0.09$\nwurtzite phase.\n", "  Transition to thermal equilibrium in a uniformly heated two-dimensional\nharmonic triangular lattice with nearest neighbor interactions is investigated.\nInitial conditions, typical for molecular dynamics simulations, are considered.\nInitially, particles have uncorrelated random velocities, corresponding to\ninitial kinetic temperature of the system, and zero displacements. These\ninitial conditions can be realized by heating of the system by an ultrafast\nlaser pulse. In this case, the kinetic temperature of the system oscillates.\nThe oscillations are caused by the redistribution of energy between kinetic and\npotential parts. At large times, energies equilibrate and temperature tends to\nthe equilibrium value equal to a half of the initial temperature. In our\nprevious works, an integral exactly describing this transient thermal process\nhas been derived. The integrand depends on the dispersion relation for the\nlattice. The integral contains large parameter, notably time. In the present\nwork, we investigate large time behavior of the kinetic temperature. Simple\nasymptotic expression for deviation of temperature from the steady state value\nis derived. The expression contains three harmonics with different frequencies\nand amplitudes. Group velocities corresponding to these frequencies are equal\nto zero. Two frequencies are close and therefore beats of kinetic temperature\nare observed. Amplitude of deviation of temperature from the steady state value\ndecreases inversely proportional to time. It is shown that the asymptotic\nformula has reasonable accuracy even at small times of order of one period of\natomic vibrations.\n", "  The work functions of (001) and (00 -1) surfaces of {\\alpha}-Fe_{2}O_{3} are\ninvestigated with density functional theory and symmetry slab model. These two\nsurfaces are found to be almost nonpolarized and their work functions are 6.10\neV and 5.49 eV respectively.\n", "  The simulation of atmospheric showers through Monte-Carlo processes as well\nas their projection into Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT) is\nlong and very computing intensive. As these simulations are the most advanced\nones from a physics point of view, they are not suited for simple tests.\n  Here we present a Python package developed in order to model atmospheric\nshowers using different profiles and to image them with an array of IACT. This\nallows for first order studies of the influence of the primary photon energy\nand angular direction on the stereoscopic images. Its simplicity also makes it\nconvenient for public dissemination and outreach as well as for teaching\npurposes.\n  This package has been developed to make the most out of the simplicity of\nPython but has also been optimised for fast calculations. It is developed in\nthe framework of the ASTERICS H2020 project and as such is available as an\nopen-source software.\n", "  We study the effect of one-dimensional (1D) photonic crystal heterojunction\n(h-PhC) on the light absorption and light emission of monolayer molybdenum\ndisulfide (MoS$_{2}$), and obtained the analytical solution of the light\nabsorption and emission of two-dimensional materials in 1D h-PhC.\nSimultaneously enhancing the light absorption and emission of the medium in\nmultiple frequency ranges is easy as h-PhC has more models of photon\nlocalization than the common photonic crystal. Result shows that h-PhC can\nsimultaneously enhance the light absorption and emission of MoS$_{2}$ and\nenhance the photoluminescence spectrum of MoS$_{2}$ by 2-3 orders of magnitude.\n", "  We recently proposed polariton graphs as a novel platform for solving hard\noptimization problems that can be mapped into the $XY$ model. Here, we\nelucidate a relationship between the energy spectrum of the $XY$ Hamiltonian\nand the total number of condensed polariton particles. Using as a test-bed the\nhexagonal unit lattice we show that the lower energy states of the $XY$\nHamiltonian are faithfully reproduced by mean-field numerical simulations\nutilising the Ginzburg--Landau equation coupled to an exciton reservoir. Our\nstudy paves the way to simulating the spectral gap of the XY model using\npolariton graphs.\n", "  The M dwarf GJ 436 hosts a transiting warm Neptune known to experience\natmospheric escape. Previous observations revealed the presence of a giant\nhydrogen exosphere transiting the star for more than 5 h, and absorbing up to\n56% of the flux in the blue wing of the stellar Lyman-{\\alpha} line of neutral\nhydrogen (H i Ly{\\alpha}). The unexpected size of this comet-like exosphere\nprevented observing the full transit of its tail. In this Letter, we present\nnew Ly{\\alpha} observations of GJ 436 obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging\nSpectrograph (STIS) instrument onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The\nstability of the Ly{\\alpha} line over six years allowed us to combine these new\nobservations with archival data sets, substantially expanding the coverage of\nthe exospheric transit. Hydrogen atoms in the tail of the exospheric cloud keep\nocculting the star for 10-25 h after the transit of the planet, remarkably\nconfirming a previous prediction based on 3D numerical simulations with the\nEVaporating Exoplanet code (EVE). This result strengthens the interpretation\nthat the exosphere of GJ 436b is shaped by both radiative braking and charge\nexchanges with the stellar wind. We further report flux decreases of 15 +/- 2%\nand 47 +/- 10% in the red wing of the Ly{\\alpha} line and in the line of\nionised silicon (Si iii). Despite some temporal variability possibly linked\nwith stellar activity, these two signals occur during the exospheric transit\nand could be of planetary origin. Follow-up observations will be required to\nassess the possibility that the redshifted Ly{\\alpha} and Si iii absorption\nsignatures arise from interactions between the exospheric flow and the magnetic\nfield of the star.\n", "  Strong electric fields are known to create biased adatom migration on\nmetallic surfaces. We present a Kinetic Monte Carlo model that can simulate\nadatom migration on a tungsten (W) surface in electric fields. We validate our\nmodel by using it to calculate the drift velocity of the adatom at different\nfields and temperature and comparing the results with experimental data from\nthe literature. We obtain excellent agreement.\n", "  The advent of the new generation of wide field galaxy surveys makes large\nN-body cosmological simulations a necessary evil. While the cosmological\nsimulation codes have evolved a lot since the first calculations in the 80s,\nthe computational requirements for generating data that is relevant for large\nsurveys remain challenging. We propose an alternative approach that can speed\nup these simulations. The framework is based on the idea of reducing the size\nof the integration region following the lightcone of an observer at redshift\nzero and thus simulating only the parts of the Universe that can be observed. A\npossible implementation of this framework is presented, as well as tests of its\naccuracy and performance. These simple tests, based on conservative\nassumptions, show that the new framework gives a factor of three speed up with\nrespect to the usual approach.\n", "  The LHCb Experiment is preparing a detector upgrade fully exploit the flavour\nphysics potential of the LHC. The whole detector will be read out at the full\ncollision rate and the online event selection will be performed by a software\ntrigger. This will increase the event yields by a facto 10 for muonic and a\nfactor 20 for hadronic final states. Research towards the upgrade has started\nwith the target to install the detector in 2018.\n", "  At present, there are many methods of quantum entanglement of particles with\nan electromagnetic field. Most methods have a low probability of quantum\nentanglement and not an exact theoretical apparatus based on an approximate\nsolution of the Schrodinger equation. There is a need for new methods for\nobtaining quantum-entangled particles and mathematically accurate studies of\nsuch methods. In this paper, a quantum harmonic oscillator (for example, an\nelectron in a magnetic field) interacting with a quantized electromagnetic\nfield is considered. Based on the exact solution of the Schrodinger equation\nfor this system, it is shown that for certain parameters there can be a large\nquantum entanglement between the electron and the electromagnetic field.\nQuantum entanglement is analyzed on the basis of a mathematically exact\nexpression for the Schmidt modes and the Von Neumann entropy.\n", "  A generalized version of the Maximum Work Theorem is valid when the system is\ninitially not at thermal equilibrium. In this work, we initially study the\nfraction of trajectories that violate this generalized theorem for a two simple\nsystems: a particle in a harmonic trap (i) whose centre is dragged with some\nprotocol, and (ii) whose stiffness constant changes as a function of time. We\nalso find the optimal protocol that minimizes the average change in total\nentropy. To our surprise, we find that optimization of protocol does not\nnecessarily entail maximum violation fraction.\n", "  Events containing a pair of high energy hadronic jet can provide clear\nsignatures in the search for new physics at high energy hadron colliders. The\nATLAS and CMS experiments collected the data from LHC collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$=\n13 TeV during 2015 and 2016, looking for evidence of new resonances or\ndeviations from the Standard Model predictions. Althoug no hint of new physics\nwas seen, strong limits have been set on the most interesting benchmark models,\nimproving LHC Run1 reach.\n", "  A partial separation of the variables is practicable for the solution of\nSchroedinger's temporally independent equation in cartesian coordinates x,y,z,\nwhich yields moderately simple algebraic formulae for the amplitude functions\ninvolving quantum numbers k,l,m, the same as in spherical polar coordinates.\nThe properties of angular momentum are thus achieved with no angular variable.\nSeveral plots of surfaces of constant psi(x,y,z) are presented to illustrate\nthe resemblance of the shapes of these surfaces to the shapes of surfaces of\npsi(r,theta,phi) with the corresponding quantum numbers.\n", "  In this paper we propose, design and test a new dual-nuclei RF-coil inspired\nby wire metamaterial structures. The coil operates due to resonant excitation\nof hybridized eigenmodes in multimode flat periodic structures comprising\nseveral coupled thin metal strips. It was shown that the field distribution of\nthe coil (i.e. penetration depth) can be controlled independently at two\ndifferent Larmor frequencies by selecting a proper eigenmode in each of two\nmutually orthogonal periodic structures. The proposed coil requires no lumped\ncapacitors for tuning and matching. In order to demonstrate the performance of\nthe new design, an experimental preclinical coil for $^{19}$F/$^{1}$H imaging\nof small animals at 7.05T was engineered and tested on a homogeneous liquid\nphantom and in-vivo. The presented results demonstrate that the coil was well\ntuned and matched simultaneously at two Larmor frequencies and capable of image\nacquisition with both the nuclei reaching large homogeneity area along with a\nsufficient signal-to-noise ratio. In an in-vivo experiment it has been shown\nthat without retuning the setup it was possible to obtain anatomical $^{1}$H\nimages of a mouse under anesthesia consecutively with $^{19}$F images of a tiny\ntube filled with a fluorine-containing liquid and attached to the body of the\nmouse.\n", "  We carried out molecular dynamics simulations (MD) using realistic empirical\npotentials for the vapor deposition (VD) of CuZrAl glasses. VD glasses have\nhigher densities and lower potential and inherent structure energies than the\nmelt-quenched glasses for the same alloys. The optimal substrate temperature\nfor the deposition process is 0.625$\\times T_\\mathrm{g}$. In VD metallic\nglasses (MGs), the total number of icosahedral like clusters is higher than in\nthe melt-quenched MGs. Surprisingly, the VD glasses have a lower degree of\nchemical mixing than the melt-quenched glasses. The reason for it is that the\nmelt-quenched MGs can be viewed as frozen liquids, which means that their\nchemical order is the same as in the liquid state. In contrast, during the\nformation of the VD MGs, the absence of the liquid state results in the\ncreation of a different chemical order with more Zr-Zr homonuclear bonds\ncompared with the melt-quenched MGs. In order to obtain MGs from melt-quench\ntechnique with similarly low energies as in the VD process, the cooling rate\nduring quenching would have to be many orders of magnitude lower than currently\naccessible to MD simulations. The method proposed in this manuscript is a more\nefficient way to create MGs by using MD simulations.\n", "  We have studied the behavior of a VLF, ELF and combined ELF/VLF antenna\nimmersed in a cold, magnetized plasma using a fully kinetic, three dimensional\nParticle-in-Cell simulation code called Large Scale Plasma (LSP). All the\nantennas are modeled as magnetic dipoles ($\\rho_{ant}=0$) and are assigned a\ntime varying current density within a finite sized current loop. The VLF\nantenna is driven at 10 Amps with a frequency ($\\omega_{VLF}$) greater than the\nlower hybrid frequency ($\\omega_{LH}$), while the ELF antenna is driven at 3\nAmps with a frequency ($\\omega_{ELF}$) less than $\\omega_{LH}$. The combined\nELF/VLF antenna (which we call a parametric antenna) includes both antennas\ndriven simultaneously in the same simulation domain. We show that the\nparametric antenna non-linearly excites electromagnetic (EM) Whistler waves to\na greater extent than the VLF antenna alone. We also show that the parametric\nexcitation of EM Whistler waves leads to greater emitted EM power (measured in\nWatts) compared with a VLF antenna alone.\n", "  The inner structure and properties (temperature, mass) of the circumstellar\ndisk of Herbig star MWC480 are studied by stellar interferometry method used in\nthe infrared and are interpreted using semi-analytical models. From these\nmodels, the SED (Spectral Energy Distribution) was fitted and multi- wavelength\nintensity map of the source were calculated. The intensity map provides the\ninput for modeling the Keck Interferometer (KI) data in the near-infrared\n(near-IR) and the data of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) with\nthe mid-infrared instrument MIDI. We conclude that with our limited set of\ndata, we can fit the SED, the Keck visibilities and the MIDI visibilities using\na two-components disk model. Furthermore, we suspect that MWC480 has a\ntransitional dusty disk. However, we need more MIDI observations with different\nbaseline orientations to confirm our modeling.\n", "  The effective dynamics for a Bose-Einstein condensate in the regime of high\ndilution and subject to an external magnetic field is governed by a magnetic\nGross-Pitaevskii equation. We elucidate the steps needed to adapt to the\nmagnetic case the proof of the derivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation\nwithin the \"projection counting\" scheme.\n", "  The search for the B-mode polarization of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nis the new frontier of observational Cosmology. A B-mode detection would give\nan ultimate confirmation to the existence of a primordial Gravitational Wave\n(GW) background as predicted in the inflationary scenario. Several experiments\nhave been designed or planned to observe B-modes. In this work we focus on the\nforthcoming Large Scale Polarization Explorer (LSPE) experiment, that will be\ndevoted to the accurate measurement of CMB polarization at large angular\nscales. LSPE consists of a balloon-borne bolometric instrument, the Short\nWavelength Instrument for the Polarization Explorer (SWIPE), and a ground-based\ncoherent polarimeter array, the STRatospheric Italian Polarimeter (STRIP).\nSWIPE will employ a rotating Half Wave Plate (HWP) polarization modulator to\nmitigate the systematic effects due to instrumental non-idealities. We present\nhere preliminary forecasts aimed at optimizing the HWP configuration.\n", "  This paper discusses a simple procedure to reconstruct f (R)-gravity models\nfrom exact cosmological solutions of the Einstein field equations with a\nnoninteracting classical scalar field-and-radiation background. From the kind\nof inflationary scenario we want, we show how the potential functions can be\nobtained. We then show how an f (R) gravitational Lagrangian density that\nmimics the same cosmological expansion as the scalar field-driven inflation of\nGeneral Relativity can be reconstructed. As a demonstration, we calculate the\nslow-roll parameters (the spectral index n s and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r)\nand compare them to the Planck data.\n", "  Seeding strategies for influence maximization in social networks have been\nstudied for more than a decade. They have mainly relied on the activation of\nall resources (seeds) simultaneously in the beginning; yet, it has been shown\nthat sequential seeding strategies are commonly better. This research focuses\non studying sequential seeding with buffering, which is an extension to basic\nsequential seeding concept. The proposed method avoids choosing nodes that will\nbe activated through the natural diffusion process, which is leading to better\nuse of the budget for activating seed nodes in the social influence process.\nThis approach was compared with sequential seeding without buffering and single\nstage seeding. The results on both real and artificial social networks confirm\nthat the buffer-based consecutive seeding is a good trade-off between the final\ncoverage and the time to reach it. It performs significantly better than its\nrivals for a fixed budget. The gain is obtained by dynamic rankings and the\nability to detect network areas with nodes that are not yet activated and have\nhigh potential of activating their neighbours.\n", "  Using the 1-BM-C beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), we have\nperformed the initial indirect x-ray imaging point-spread-function (PSF) test\nof a unique 88-mm diameter YAG:Ce single crystal of only 100-micron thickness.\nThe crystal was bonded to a fiber optic plate (FOP) for mechanical support and\nto allow the option for FO coupling to a large format camera. This\nconfiguration resolution was compared to that of self-supported 25-mm diameter\ncrystals, with and without an Al reflective coating. An upstream monochromator\nwas used to select 17-keV x-rays from the broadband APS bending magnet source\nof synchrotron radiation. The upstream, adjustable Mo collimators were then\nused to provide a series of x-ray source transverse sizes from 200 microns down\nto about 15-20 microns (FWHM) at the crystal surface. The emitted scintillator\nradiation was in this case lens coupled to the ANDOR Neo sCMOS camera, and the\nindirect x-ray images were processed offline by a MATLAB-based image processing\nprogram. Based on single Gaussian peak fits to the x-ray image projected\nprofiles, we observed a 10.5 micron PSF. This sample thus exhibited superior\nspatial resolution to standard P43 polycrystalline phosphors of the same\nthickness which would have about a 100-micron PSF. This single crystal\nresolution combined with the 88-mm diameter makes it a candidate to support\nfuture x-ray diffraction or wafer topography experiments.\n", "  Stellar rotation is a key in our understanding of both mass-loss and\nevolution of intermediate and massive stars. It can lead to anisotropic\nmass-loss in the form of radiative wind or an excretion disk. We wished to\nspatially resolve the photosphere and gaseous environment of 51 Oph, a peculiar\nstar with a very high vsin(i) of 267km s$^{-1}$ and an evolutionary status that\nremains unsettled. It has been classified by different authors as a Herbig, a\n$\\beta$ Pic, or a classical Be star. We used the VEGA visible beam combiner\ninstalled on the CHARA array that reaches a submilliarcsecond resolution.\nObservation were centered on the H$\\alpha$ emission line. We derived, for the\nfirst time, the extension and flattening of 51 Oph photosphere. We found a\nmajor axis of $\\theta_{{\\mathrm{eq}}}$=8.08$\\pm$0.70$R_\\odot$ and a minor axis\nof $\\theta_{{\\mathrm{pol}}}$=5.66$\\pm$0.23$R_\\odot$ .\n  This high photosphere distortion shows that the star is rotating close to its\ncritical velocity. Finally, using spectro-interferometric measurements in the\nH$ \\alpha$ line, we constrained the circumstellar environment geometry and\nkinematics and showed that the emission is produced in a 5.2$\\pm$2R$_{*}$ disk\nin Keplerian rotation. From the visible point of view, 51 Oph presents all the\nfeatures of a classical Be star: near critical-rotation and double-peaked\nH$\\alpha $ line in emission produced in a gaseous disk in Keplerian rotation.\nHowever, this does not explain the presence of dust as seen in the mid-infrared\nand millimeter spectra, and the evolutionary status of 51 Oph remains\nunsettled.\n", "  We introduce a formalism for describing four-dimensional scattering\namplitudes for particles of any mass and spin. This naturally extends the\nfamiliar spinor-helicity formalism for massless particles to one where these\nvariables carry an extra SU(2) little group index for massive particles, with\nthe amplitudes for spin S particles transforming as symmetric rank 2S tensors.\nWe systematically characterise all possible three particle amplitudes\ncompatible with Poincare symmetry. Unitarity, in the form of consistent\nfactorization, imposes algebraic conditions that can be used to construct all\npossible four-particle tree amplitudes. This also gives us a convenient basis\nin which to expand all possible four-particle amplitudes in terms of what can\nbe called \"spinning polynomials\". Many general results of quantum field theory\nfollow the analysis of four-particle scattering, ranging from the set of all\npossible consistent theories for massless particles, to spin-statistics, and\nthe Weinberg-Witten theorem. We also find a transparent understanding for why\nmassive particles of sufficiently high spin can not be \"elementary\". The Higgs\nand Super-Higgs mechanisms are naturally discovered as an infrared unification\nof many disparate helicity amplitudes into a smaller number of massive\namplitudes, with a simple understanding for why this can't be extended to\nHiggsing for gravitons. We illustrate a number of applications of the formalism\nat one-loop, giving few-line computations of the electron (g-2) as well as the\nbeta function and rational terms in QCD. \"Off-shell\" observables like\ncorrelation functions and form-factors can be thought of as scattering\namplitudes with external \"probe\" particles of general mass and spin, so all\nthese objects--amplitudes, form factors and correlators, can be studied from a\ncommon on-shell perspective.\n", "  Given a classical error-correcting block code, the task of quantum list\ndecoding is to produce from any quantumly corrupted codeword a short list\ncontaining all messages whose codewords exhibit high \"presence\" in the\nquantumly corrupted codeword. Efficient quantum list decoders have been used to\nprove a quantum hardcore property of classical codes. However, the code rates\nof all known families of efficiently quantum list-decodable codes are,\nunfortunately, too small for other practical applications. To improve those\nknown code rates, we prove that a specific code family of polynomially small\ncode rate over a fixed code alphabet, obtained by concatenating generalized\nReed-Solomon codes as outer codes with Hadamard codes as inner codes, has an\nefficient quantum list-decoding algorithm if its codewords have relatively high\ncodeword presence in a given quantumly corrupted codeword. As an immediate\napplication, we use the quantum list decodability of this code family to solve\na certain form of quantum search problems in polynomial time. When the codeword\npresence becomes smaller, in contrast, we show that the quantum list\ndecodability of generalized Reed-Solomon codes with high confidence is closely\nrelated to the efficient solvability of the following two problems: the noisy\npolynomial interpolation problem and the bounded distance vector problem.\nMoreover, assuming that NP is not included in BQP, we also prove that no\nefficient quantum list decoder exists for the generalized Reed-Solomon codes.\n"]}
