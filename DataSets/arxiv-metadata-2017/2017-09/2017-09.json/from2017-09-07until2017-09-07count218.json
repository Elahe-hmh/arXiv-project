"abstract": ["  Regularity and topology conditions are imposed on the exact Type IIB\nsolutions on $AdS_4 \\times S^2 \\times S^2 \\times \\Sigma $ with 16\nsupersymmetries, which were derived in a companion paper. We construct an\ninfinite class of regular solutions with varying dilaton, and non-zero 3-form\nfluxes. Our solutions may be viewed as the fully back-reacted geometries of\n$AdS_5 \\times S^5$ (or more generally, Janus) doped with D5 and/or NS5 branes.\nThe solutions are parametrized by the choice of an arbitrary genus $g$\nhyper-elliptic Riemann surface $\\Sigma $ with boundary, all of whose branch\npoints are restricted to lie on a line. For genus 0, the Janus solution with 16\nsupersymmetries and 6 real parameters is recovered; its topology coincides with\nthat of $AdS_5 \\times S^5$. The genus $g\\geq 1$ solutions are parametrized by a\ntotal of $4g+6$ real numbers, $2g-1$ of which are the real moduli of $\\Sigma$.\nThe solutions have $2g+2$ asymptotic $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ regions, $g$\nthree-spheres with RR 3-form charge, and another $g$ with NSNS 3-form charge.\nCollapse of consecutive branch points of $\\Sigma $ yields singularities which\ncorrespond to D5 and NS5 branes in the probe limit. It is argued that the\nAdS/CFT dual gauge theory to each of our solutions consists of a\n2+1-dimensional planar interface on which terminate $2g+2$ half-Minkowski\n3+1-dimensional space-time $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories.\nGenerally, the $\\\\mathcal{N}=4$ theory in each Minkowski half-space-time may\nhave an independent value of the gauge coupling, and the interface may support\nvarious operators, whose interface couplings are further free parameters of the\ndual gauge theory.\n", "  We explicitly construct the fully back-reacted half-BPS solutions in Type IIB\nsupergravity which are dual to Wilson loops with 16 supersymmetries in\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. In a first part, we use the methods of a\ncompanion paper to derive the exact general solution of the half-BPS equations\non the space $AdS_2 \\times S^2 \\times S^4 \\times \\Sigma$, with isometry group\n$SO(2,1)\\times SO(3) \\times SO(5)$ in terms of two locally harmonic functions\non a Riemann surface $\\Sigma$ with boundary. These solutions, generally, have\nvarying dilaton and axion, and non-vanishing 3-form fluxes. In a second part,\nwe impose regularity and topology conditions. These non-singular solutions may\nbe parametrized by a genus $g \\geq 0$ hyperelliptic surface $\\Sigma$, all of\nwhose branch points lie on the real line. Each genus $g$ solution has only a\nsingle asymptotic $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ region, but exhibits $g$ homology\n3-spheres, and an extra $g$ homology 5-spheres, carrying respectively RR 3-form\nand RR 5-form charges. For genus 0, we recover $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ with 3 free\nparameters, while for genus $g \\geq 1$, the solution has $2g+5$ free\nparameters. The genus 1 case is studied in detail. Numerical analysis is used\nto show that the solutions are regular throughout the $g=1$ parameter space.\nCollapse of a branch cut on $\\Sigma$ subtending either a homology 3-sphere or a\nhomology 5-sphere is non-singular and yields the genus $g-1$ solution. This\nbehavior is precisely expected of a proper dual to a Wilson loop in gauge\ntheory.\n", "  A quarter-BPS dyon in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory is generically\n`decadent' in that it is stable only in some regions of the moduli space and\ndecays on submanifolds in the moduli space. Using this fact, and from the\ndegeneracy of the system close to the decay, a new derivation for the\ndegeneracy of such dyons is given. The degeneracy obtained from these very\nsimple physical considerations is in precise agreement with the results\nobtained from index computations in all known cases. Similar considerations\napply to dyons in $\\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories. The relation between the\n$\\mathcal{N} =4 $ field theory dyons and those counted by the Igusa cusp form\nin toroidally compactified heterotic string is elucidated.\n", "  We consider the Soft-Wall-model of AdS/QCD to calculate photon production in\nstrongly coupled Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP). The IR cut-off only affects the\nlow-frequency-component of the production rate. The full spectral function is\ndetermined numerically and shows remarkable similarity to computations of the\nphoton production rate in AdS-duals of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories with massive\nflavor. It is further support that Soft-Wall AdS-QCD correctly captures the IR\nphysics of the chiral perturbation theory regime of QCD. We confirm this by\nrelating the IR-effects of the massive flavor deformations to the AdS/QCD soft\nwall cut-off. The AdS/QCD spectral function is smooth, however, and unlike\nmassive flavor models shows no spectral peaks.\n", "  We examine the string dual of the recently constructed $\\mathcal{N}=6$\nsuperconformal Chern-Simons theory of Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena\n(ABJM theory). We focus in particular on the $SU(2)\\times SU(2)$ sector. We\nfind a sigma-model limit in which the resulting sigma-model is two\nLandau-Lifshitz models added together. We consider a Penrose limit for which we\ncan approach the $SU(2)\\times SU(2)$ sector. Finally, we find a new Giant\nMagnon solution in the $SU(2)\\times SU(2)$ sector corresponding to one magnon\nin each $SU(2)$. We put these results together to find the full magnon\ndispersion relation and we compare this to recently found results for ABJM\ntheory at weak coupling.\n", "  We explore further our recent generalization of the $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nsuperconformal Chern-Simons theories of Gaiotto and Witten. We find and\nconstruct explicitly theories of enhanced $\\mathcal{N}=5$ or 6 supersymmetry,\nespecially $\\mathcal{N}=5$, $Sp(2M)\\times O(N)$ and $\\mathcal{N}=6$,\n$Sp(2M)\\times O(2)$ theories. The $U(M)\\times U(N)$ theory coincides with the\n$\\mathcal{N}=6$ theory of Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena (ABJM). We\nargue that the $\\mathcal{N}=5$ theory with $Sp(2N)\\times O(2N)$ gauge group can\nbe understood as an orientifolding of the ABJM model with $U(2N)\\times U(2N)$\ngauge group. We briefly discuss the Type IIB brane construction of the\n$\\mathcal{N}=5$ theory and the geometry of the M-theory orbifold.\n", "  We find the exact solution for a finite size Giant Magnon in the $SU(2)\\times\nSU(2)$ sector of the string dual of the $\\mathcal{N}=6$ superconformal\nChern-Simons theory recently constructed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and\nMaldacena. The finite size Giant Magnon solution consists of two magnons, one\nin each $SU(2)$. In the infinite size limit this solution corresponds to the\nGiant Magnon solution of arXiv:0806.4959. The magnon dispersion relation\nexhibits finite-size exponential corrections with respect to the infinite size\nlimit solution.\n", "  We study eight fermion terms in the effective action of the ABJM model. We\nshow the non-renormalization of $v^2$ terms. After classifying all the possible\neight fermion structures, we show that $\\mathcal{N}=6$ supersymmetry determines\nall these terms completely up to an overall constant. This confirms the one\nloop non-renormalization of $v^4$ terms.\n", "  In this paper we show that a particular twist of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super\nYang-Mills in three dimensions with gauge group SU(2) possesses a set of\nclassical vacua corresponding to the space of flat connections of the {\\it\ncomplexified} gauge group $SL(2,C)$. The theory also contains a set of\ntopological observables corresponding to Wilson loops wrapping non-trivial\ncycles of the base manifold. This moduli space and set of topological\nobservables is shared with the Chern Simons formulation of three dimensional\ngravity and we hence conjecture that the Yang-Mills theory gives an equivalent\ndescription of the gravitational theory. Unlike the Chern Simons formulation\nthe twisted Yang-Mills theory possesses a supersymmetric and gauge invariant\nlattice construction which then provides a possible non-perturbative definition\nof three dimensional gravity.\n", "  I review recent approaches to constructing supersymmetric lattice theories\nfocusing in particular on the concept of topological twisting. The latter\ntechnique is shown to expose a nilpotent, scalar supersymmetry which can be\nimplemented exactly in the lattice theory. Using these ideas a lattice action\nfor $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills in four dimensions can be written down\nwhich is gauge invariant, free of fermion doublers and respects one out of a\ntotal of 16 continuum supersymmetries. It is shown how these exact symmetries\ntogether with the large point group symmetry of the lattice strongly constrain\nthe possible counterterms needed to renormalize the theory and hence determine\nhow much residual fine tuning will be needed to restore all supersymmetries in\nthe continuum limit. We report on progress to study these renormalization\neffects at one loop. We go on to give examples of applications of these\nsupersymmetric lattice theories to explore the connections between gauge\ntheories and gravity.\n", "  We test the AdS/CFT correspondence by computing the partition function of\nsome $\\mathcal{N}=2$ quiver Chern-Simons-matter theories on three-sphere. The\nM-theory backgrounds are of the Freund-Rubin type with the seven-dimensional\ninternal space given as Sasaki-Einstein manifolds $Q^{1,1,1}$ or $V^{5,2}$.\nLocalization technique reduces the exact path integral to a matrix model, and\nwe study the large-N behavior of the partition function. For simplicity we\nconsider only non-chiral models which have a real-valued partition function.\nThe result is in full agreement with the prediction of the gravity duals, i.e.\nthe free energy is proportional to $N^{3/2}$ and the coefficient matches\ncorrectly the volume of $Q^{1,1,1}$ and $V^{5,2}$.\n", "  We provide an analytic formula for the (rescaled) one-loop scalar hexagon\nintegral $\\tilde\\Phi_6$ with all external legs massless, in terms of classical\npolylogarithms. We show that this integral is closely connected to two\nintegrals appearing in one- and two-loop amplitudes in planar $\\\\mathcal{N}=4$\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory, $\\Omega^{(1)}$ and $\\Omega^{(2)}$. The derivative of\n$\\Omega^{(2)}$ with respect to one of the conformal invariants yields\n$\\tilde\\Phi_6$, while another first-order differential operator applied to\n$\\tilde\\Phi_6$ yields $\\Omega^{(1)}$. We also introduce some kinematic\nvariables that rationalize the arguments of the polylogarithms, making it easy\nto verify the latter differential equation. We also give a further example of a\nsix-dimensional integral relevant for amplitudes in $\\\\mathcal{N}=4$\nsuper-Yang-Mills.\n", "  We present a uniform treatment of rigid supersymmetric field theories in a\ncurved spacetime $\\mathcal{M}$, focusing on four-dimensional theories with four\nsupercharges. Our discussion is significantly simpler than earlier treatments,\nbecause we use classical background values of the auxiliary fields in the\nsupergravity multiplet. We demonstrate our procedure using several examples.\nFor $\\mathcal{M}=AdS_4$ we reproduce the known results in the literature. A\nsupersymmetric Lagrangian for $\\mathcal{M}=\\mathbb{S}^4$ exists, but unless the\nfield theory is conformal, it is not reflection positive. We derive the\nLagrangian for $\\mathcal{M}=\\mathbb{S}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}$ and note that the\ntime direction $\\mathbb{R}$ can be rotated to Euclidean signature and be\ncompactified to $\\S^1$ only when the theory has a continuous R-symmetry. The\npartition function on $\\mathcal{M}=\\mathbb{S}^3\\times \\S^1$ is independent of\nthe parameters of the flat space theory and depends holomorphically on some\ncomplex background gauge fields. We also consider R-invariant $\\mathcal{N}=2$\ntheories on $\\mathbb{S}^3$ and clarify a few points about them.\n", "  We construct explicitly all extremal instanton solutions to $\\mathcal{N}=4,\\,\nD=4$ supergravity truncated to one vector field (Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion\n(EMDA) theory). These correspond to null geodesics of the target space of the\nsigma-model $G/H=Sp(4,\\mathbb{R})/GL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ obtained by\ncompactification of four-dimensional Euclidean EMDA on a circle. They satisfy a\nno-force condition in terms of the asymptotic charges and part of them\n(corresponding to nilpotent orbits of the $Sp(4,\\mathbb{R})$ U-duality) are\npresumably supersymmetric. The space of finite action solutions is found to be\nunexpectedly large and includes, besides the Euclidean versions of known\nLorentzian solutions, a number of new asymptotically locally flat (ALF)\ninstantons endowed with electric, magnetic, dilaton and axion charges. We also\ndescribe new classes of charged asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE)\ninstantons as well as some exceptional solutions. Our classification scheme is\nbased on the algebraic classification of matrix generators according to their\nrank, according to the nature of the charge vectors and according to the number\nof independent harmonic functions with unequal charges. Besides the nilpotent\norbits of $G$, we find solutions which satisfy the asymptotic no-force\ncondition, but are not supersymmetric. The renormalized on-shell action for\ninstantons is calculated using the method of matched background subtraction.\n", "  Discretization of supersymmetric Yang--Mills (SYM) theories is an old problem\nin lattice field theory. It has resisted solution until recently when new ideas\ndrawn from orbifold constructions and topological field theories have been\nbrought to bear on the question. The result has been the creation of a new\nclass of lattice gauge theories in which the lattice action is invariant under\none or more supersymmetries. The resultant theories are local, free of doublers\nand also possess exact gauge-invariance. In principle they form the basis for a\ntruly non-perturbative definition of the continuum SYM theories. In the\ncontinuum limit they lead to a version of the Yang-Mills theory formulated in\nterms of {\\it twisted} fields. In this paper, we briefly review these ideas and\nthen go on to describe the details of a C++ code, which can be used to simulate\nthese theories. We sketch the design of the code, with particular emphasis\nbeing placed on SYM theories with $\\mathcal{N}=2$ in two dimensions and\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ in three and four dimensions, making one-to-one comparisons\nbetween the essential components of the SYM theories and their corresponding\ncounterparts appearing in the simulation\n", "  We argue the equivalence between the infrared conformal field theory of the\n3d $\\mathcal{N}=8$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories of ABCD ($U(N), SO(2N+1),\nSp(2N), O(2N)$) gauge groups and the ABJ(M) theories of $U(N)_k\\times U(\\tilde\nN)_{-k}$ for $k=1,2$. We support this duality by comparing the superconformal\nindex of the IR limit of these super Yang-Mills theories and that of those\nABJ(M) models. Especially we find the match between two indices of (mirror dual\nof) the $\\mathcal{N}=8$ U(N) SYM and of $U(N)_1\\times U(N)_{-1}$ ABJM model.\nAlso we take large $N$ limit of ABCD super Yang-Mills theories with additional\nfundamental hyper-multiplets and infer the large N limit of $\\mathcal{N}=8$\nABCD theories themselves, finding the expected gravitational duals. With the\nadditional input on finite N, we argue the equivalence of Yang-Mills and ABJ(M)\ntheories for all N. We further explore similar dualities to Chern-Simons matter\ntheories for $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills theories related by mirror symmetry.\n", "  This talk is based on the recent work in collaboration with M.\nAzreg-A\\\"{\\i}nou and G. Cl\\'ement devoted to extremal instantons in the\none-vector truncation of the Euclidean $\\mathcal{N}=4,\\, D=4$ theory. Extremal\nsolutions satisfying the no-force condition can be associated with null\ngeodesic curves in the homogeneous target space of the three-dimensional sigma\nmodel arising in toroidal reduction of the four-dimensional theory. Here we\n(preliminarily) discuss the case of two vector fields sufficient to find all\nrelevant metrics in the full $\\mathcal{N}=4,\\, D=4$ theory. Classification of\ninstanton solutions is given along the following lines. The first is their\npossible asymptotic structure: asymptotically locally flat (ALF),\nasymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) and ALF or ALE with the dilaton growing\nat infinity. The second is the algebraic characterization of matrix generators\naccording to their rank and the nature of the charge vectors in an associated\nLorentzian space. Finally, solutions are distinguished by the number of\nindependent harmonic functions with unequal charges (up to four).\n", "  Analytic solutions for cylindrical thermal waves in solid medium is given\nbased on the nonlinear hyperbolic system of heat flux relaxation and energy\nconservation equations. The Fourier-Cattaneo phenomenological law is\ngeneralized where the relaxation time and heat propagation coefficient have a\ngeneral power law temperature dependence. From such laws one cannot form a\nsecond order parabolic or telegraph-type equation. We consider the original\nnon-linear hyperbolic system itself with the self-similar Ansatz for the\ntemperature distribution and for the heat flux. As results continuous and\nshock-wave solutions are presented. For physical establishment numerous\nmaterials with various temperature dependent heat conduction coefficients are\nmentioned.\n", "  We construct an $\\mathcal{N}$ supersymmetric sigma model on the cotangent\nbundle over the Hermitian symmetric space $E_7/(E_6\\times U(1))$ in the\nprojective superspace formalism, which is a manifest $\\mathcal{N}=2$ off-shell\nsuperfield formulation in four-dimensional spacetime. To obtain this model we\nelaborate on results developed in arXiv:0811.0218 and present a new closed\nformula for the cotangent bundle action, which is valid for all Hermitian\nsymmetric spaces. We show that the structure of cotangent bundle action is\nintimately related to the analytic structure of the K\\\"ahler potential with\nrespect to a uniform rescaling of coordinates.\n", "  We investigate options for the structure of the infrared fixed points of\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ bad theories in three dimensions. Unitarity constraints allow a\nnumber of possibilities, not necessarily a product of an interacting\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFT and free theories. For each option we provide relations\nbetween the UV and IR $R-$symmetry groups. For some of them we give examples.\nIn particular, the $\\mathcal{N}4$ SU(2) SYM with two fundamental\nhypermultiplets is an example of a bad theory which flows to an interacting\nirreducible SCFT in the IR. The question of whether all the options are\nrealized remains open.\n", "  We work out Seiberg-like dualities for 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories with SU(N)\ngauge group. We use the $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ action on 3d conformal field\ntheories with U(1) global symmetry. One of generator S of $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$\nacts as gauging of the U(1) global symmetry. Utilizing $S=S^{-1}$ up to charge\nconjugation, we obtain Seiberg-like dual of SU(N) theories by gauging\ntopological U(1) symmetry of the Seiberg-like dual of U(N) theories with the\nsame matter content. We work out the Aharony dualities for SU(N) gauge theory\nwith $N_f$ fundamental/anti-fundamnetal flavors, with/without one adjoint\nmatter with the superpotential. We also work out the Giveon-Kutasov dualities\nfor SU(N) gauge theory with Chern-Simons term and with $N_f$\nfundamental/anti-fundamental flavors. For all the proposed dualities, we give\nvarious evidences such as chiral ring matching and the superconformal index\ncomputations. We find the perfect matchings.\n", "  We develop a superfield formulation of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory with gauged central charge in $USp(4)$ harmonic superspace.\nComponent formulation of this theory was given by Sohnius, Stelle and West\n\\cite{SSW80} but its superfield formulation has not been constructed so far. We\nconstruct the superfield action, corresponding to this model, and show that it\nreproduces the component action from \\cite{SSW80}.\n", "  In order to investigate collective effects of interactions between\npedestrians and attractions, this study extends the social force model. Such\ninteractions lead pedestrians to form stable clusters around attractions, or\neven to rush into attractions if the interaction becomes stronger. It is also\nfound that for high pedestrian density and intermediate interaction strength,\nsome pedestrians rush into attractions while others move to neighboring\nattractions. These collective patterns of pedestrian movements or phases and\ntransitions between them are systematically presented in a phase diagram. The\nresults suggest that safe and efficient use of pedestrian areas can be achieved\nby moderating the pedestrian density and the strength of attractive\ninteraction, for example, in order to avoid situations involving extreme desire\nfor limited resources.\n", "  The Precision IceCube Next Generation Upgrade (PINGU) is a proposed\nlow-energy in-fill array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Leveraging\ntechnology proven with IceCube, PINGU will feature the world's largest\neffective volume for neutrinos at an energy threshold of a few GeV, improving\nthe sensitivity to several aspects of neutrino oscillation physics at modest\ncost. With its unprecedented statistical sample of low-energy atmospheric\nneutrinos, PINGU will have highly competitive sensitivity to $\\nu_{\\mu}$\ndisappearance, the $\\theta_{23}$ octant, and maximal mixing, will make the\nworld's best $\\nu_{\\tau}$ appearance measurement, allowing a unique probe of\nthe unitarity of the PMNS mixing matrix, and will be able to distinguish the\nneutrino mass ordering at $3\\sigma$ significance with less than 4 years of\ndata. PINGU can also extend the indirect search for solar WIMP dark matter\ncomplimentary to the on-going and planned direct dark matter experiments. At\nthe lower end of the energy range, PINGU may use neutrino tomography to\ndirectly probe the composition of the Earth's core. With its increased module\ndensity, PINGU will improve IceCube's sensitivity to galactic supernova\nneutrino bursts and enable it to extract the neutrino energy spectral shape.\n", "  A scaling relation has recently been suggested to combine the galaxy\nmass-metallicity (MZ) relation with metallicities of damped Lyman-alpha systems\n(DLAs) in quasar spectra. Based on this relation the stellar masses of the\nabsorbing galaxies can be predicted. We test this prediction by measuring the\nstellar masses of 12 galaxies in confirmed DLA absorber - galaxy pairs in the\nredshift range 0.1<z<3.2. We find an excellent agreement between the predicted\nand measured stellar masses over three orders of magnitude, and we determine\nthe average offset $\\langle C_{[M/H]} \\rangle$ = 0.44+/-0.10 between absorption\nand emission metallicities. We further test if $C_{[M/H]}$ could depend on the\nimpact parameter and find a correlation at the 5.5sigma level. The impact\nparameter dependence of the metallicity corresponds to an average metallicity\ndifference of -0.022+/-0.004 dex/kpc. By including this metallicity vs. impact\nparameter correlation in the prescription instead of $C_{[M/H]}$, the scatter\nreduces to 0.39 dex in log M*. We provide a prescription how to calculate the\nstellar mass (M*,DLA) of the galaxy when both the DLA metallicity and DLA\ngalaxy impact parameter is known. We demonstrate that DLA galaxies follow the\nMZ relation for luminosity-selected galaxies at z=0.7 and z=2.2 when we include\na correction for the correlation between impact parameter and metallicity.\n", "  In the Euclidean space of any dimension d, we consider the heat semigroup\ngenerated by the magnetic Schroedinger operator from which an inverse-square\npotential is subtracted in order to make the operator critical in the\nmagnetic-free case. Assuming that the magnetic field is compactly supported, we\nshow that the polynomial large-time behaviour of the heat semigroup is\ndetermined by the eigenvalue problem for a magnetic Schroedinger operator on\nthe (d-1)-dimensional sphere whose vector potential reflects the behaviour of\nthe magnetic field at the space infinity. From the spectral problem on the\nsphere, we deduce that in d=2 there is an improvement of the decay rate of the\nheat semigroup by a polynomial factor with power proportional to the distance\nof the total magnetic flux to the discrete set of flux quanta, while there is\nno extra polynomial decay rate in higher dimensions. To prove the results, we\nestablish new magnetic Hardy-type inequalities for the Schroedinger operator\nand develop the method of self-similar variables and weighted Sobolev spaces\nfor the associated heat equation.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the geodesics of the 4-dimensional ($4D$) linear\ndilaton black hole (LDBH) spacetime, which is an exact solution to the\nEinstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory. LDBHs have non-asymptotically flat (NAF)\ngeometry, and their Hawking radiation is an isothermal process. The geodesics\nmotions of the test particles are studied via the standard Lagrangian method.\nAfter obtaining the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations, we show that exact\nanalytical solutions to the radial and angular geodesic equations can be\nobtained. In particular, it is shown that one of the possible solutions for the\nradial trajectories can be given in terms of the WeierstrassP-function\n($\\wp$-function), which is an elliptic-type special function.\n", "  Using an operator-theoretic framework in a Hilbert-space setting, we perform\na detailed spectral analysis of the one-dimensional Laplacian in a bounded\ninterval, subject to specific non-self-adjoint connected boundary conditions\nmodelling a random jump from the boundary to a point inside the interval. In\naccordance with previous works, we find that all the eigenvalues are real. As\nthe new results, we derive and analyse the adjoint operator, determine the\ngeometric and algebraic multiplicities of the eigenvalues, write down formulae\nfor the eigenfunctions together with the generalised eigenfunctions and study\ntheir basis properties. It turns out that the latter heavily depend on whether\nthe distance of the interior point to the centre of the interval divided by the\nlength of the interval is rational or irrational. Finally, we find a closed\nformula for the metric operator that provides a similarity transform of the\nproblem to a self-adjoint operator.\n", "  A general tension-reduction (GTR) model was recently considered to derive\nquantum probabilities as (universal) averages over all possible forms of\nnon-uniform fluctuations, and explain their considerable success in describing\nexperimental situations also outside of the domain of physics, for instance in\nthe ambit of quantum models of cognition and decision. Yet, this result also\nhighlighted the possibility of observing violations of the predictions of the\nBorn rule, in those situations where the averaging would not be large enough,\nor would be altered because of the combination of multiple measurements. In\nthis article we show that this is indeed the case in typical psychological\nmeasurements exhibiting question order effects, by showing that their\nstatistics of outcomes are inherently non-Hilbertian, and require the larger\nframework of the GTR-model to receive an exact mathematical description. We\nalso consider another unsolved problem of quantum cognition: response\nreplicability. It is has been observed that when question order effects and\nresponse replicability occur together, the situation cannot be handled anymore\nby quantum theory. However, we show that it can be easily and naturally\ndescribed in the GTR-model. Based on these findings, we motivate the adoption\nin cognitive science of a hidden-measurements interpretation of the quantum\nformalism, and of its GTR-model generalization, as the natural interpretational\nframework explaining the data of psychological measurements on conceptual\nentities.\n", "  The Hurwitz-type Euler zeta function is defined as a deformation of the\nHurwitz zeta function: \\begin{equation*}\n\\zeta_E(s,x)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+x)^s}. \\end{equation*} In this\npaper, by using the method of Fourier expansions, we shall evaluate several\nintegrals with integrands involving Hurwitz-type Euler zeta functions\n$\\zeta_E(s,x)$. Furthermore, the relations between the values of a class of the\nHurwitz-type (or Lerch-type) Euler zeta functions at rational arguments have\nalso been given.\n", "  We present a very general geometrico-dynamical description of physical or\nmore abstract entities, called the 'general tension-reduction' (GTR) model,\nwhere not only states, but also measurement-interactions can be represented,\nand the associated outcome probabilities calculated. Underlying the model is\nthe hypothesis that indeterminism manifests as a consequence of unavoidable\nfluctuations in the experimental context, in accordance with the\n'hidden-measurements interpretation' of quantum mechanics. When the structure\nof the state space is Hilbertian, and measurements are of the 'universal' kind,\ni.e., are the result of an average over all possible ways of selecting an\noutcome, the GTR-model provides the same predictions of the Born rule, and\ntherefore provides a natural completed version of quantum mechanics. However,\nwhen the structure of the state space is non-Hilbertian and/or not all possible\nways of selecting an outcome are available to be actualized, the predictions of\nthe model generally differ from the quantum ones, especially when sequential\nmeasurements are considered. Some paradigmatic examples will be discussed,\ntaken from physics and human cognition. Particular attention will be given to\nsome known psychological effects, like question order effects and response\nreplicability, which we show are able to generate non-Hilbertian statistics. We\nalso suggest a realistic interpretation of the GTR-model, when applied to human\ncognition and decision, which we think could become the generally adopted\ninterpretative framework in quantum cognition research.\n", "  Stellarators commonly comprise different sets of coils to produce diverse\nmagnetic configurations. However, the diversity of possible configurations in a\nsingle device is usually rather limited. The achievement of a broad variety of\nmagnetic configurations might be valuable for some purposes, for example, to\nassay the effect of the magnetic configuration on turbulent transport. Thus, a\nmethod is created to systematically define sets of modular coils located on\nconcentric toroidal winding surfaces. The method is based on the expression of\na Last Closed Flux Surface (LCFS) by Fourier coefficients in cylindrical\ncoordinates and consists in the definition of successive windings located on\nequidistant concentric winding surfaces, each winding such that produces a\nmagnetic field which, when added to the magnetic field generated by a sole base\nwinding that generates a base magnetic configuration, produces a magnetic\nconfiguration whose LCFS is defined by the Fourier coefficients of the base\nmagnetic configuration plus only one new Fourier coefficient. The utilization\nof a diversity of currents in the different windings would give a linear\ncombination of magnetic fields that reproduce the LCFS defined mathematically\nby the respective Fourier coefficients. The deviation between a particular\nmodelled LCFS and the obtained LCFS from the windings depends on: the order and\nvalue of each Fourier coefficient, the selected shape of concentric winding\nsurfaces, and the possible intersection of the LCFS with the internal winding\nsurface. The method to generate the windings is reported and the application to\none case study is described. Each modelled LCFS is compared with the respective\nPoincar\\'e plot obtained from the linear combination of magnetic fields from\nthe windings.\n", "  We study critical and magnetic properties of a bilayer Ising system\nconsisting of two triangular planes A and B, with the antiferromagnetic (AF)\ncoupling $J_{\\rm A}$ and the ferromagnetic (FM) one $J_{\\rm B}$ for the\nrespective layers, which are coupled by the interlayer interaction $J_{\\rm AB}$\nby using Monte Carlo simulations. When $J_{\\rm A}$ and $J_{\\rm B}$ are of the\nsame order, the unfrustrated FM plane orders first at a high temperature\n$T_{c1} \\sim J_{\\rm B}$. The spontaneous FM order then exerts influence on the\nother frustrated AF plane as an effective magnetic field, which subsequently\ninduces a ferrimagnetic order in this plane at low temperatures below $T_{c2}$.\nWhen short-range order is developed in the AF plane while the influence of the\nFM plane is still small, there appears a preemptive\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like pseudocritical crossover regime just above\nthe ferrimagnetic phase transition point, where the short-distance behavior up\nto a rather large length scale exponentially diverging in $\\propto \\JA / T$ is\ncontrolled by a line of Gaussian fixed points at $T = 0$. In the crossover\nregion, a continuous variation in the effective critical exponent $4/9 \\lesssim\n\\eta^{\\rm eff} \\lesssim 1/2$ is observed. The phase diagram by changing the\nratio $J_{\\rm A}/J_{\\rm B}$ is also investigated.\n", "  We establish general limits on how precise a parameter, e.g. frequency or the\nstrength of a magnetic field, can be estimated with the aid of full and fast\nquantum control. We consider uncorrelated noisy evolutions of N qubits and show\nthat fast control allows to fully restore the Heisenberg scaling (~1/N^2) for\nall rank-one Pauli noise except dephasing. For all other types of noise the\nasymptotic quantum enhancement is unavoidably limited to a constant-factor\nimprovement over the standard quantum limit (~1/N) even when allowing for the\nfull power of fast control. The latter holds both in the single-shot and\ninfinitely-many repetitions scenarios. However, even in this case allowing for\nfast quantum control helps to increase the improvement factor. Furthermore, for\nfrequency estimation with finite resource we show how a parallel scheme\nutilizing any fixed number of entangled qubits but no fast quantum control can\nbe outperformed by a simple, easily implementable, sequential scheme which only\nrequires entanglement between one sensing and one auxiliary qubit.\n", "  Nonlinear supercoherent states, which are eigenstates of nonlinear\ndeformations of the Kornbluth-Zypman annihilation operator for the\nsupersymmetric harmonic oscillator, will be studied. They turn out to be\nexpressed in terms of nonlinear coherent states, associated to the\ncorresponding deformations of the standard annihilation operator. We will\ndiscuss as well the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for a special particular\ncase, in order to compare our results with those obtained for the\nKornbluth-Zypman linear supercoherent states. As the supersymmetric harmonic\noscillator executes an evolution loop, such that the evolution operator becomes\nthe identity at a certain time, thus the linear and nonlinear supercoherent\nstates turn out to be cyclic and the corresponding geometric phases will be\nevaluated.\n", "  It is shown how bosonic material particles can emerge from a covariant\nformulation of de Broglie-Bohm theory. The formulation is based on the work of\nNikolic. Material particles are continuous fields, formed as the eigenvalue of\nthe Schrodinger field operator, evaluated along a Bohmian trajectory.\n", "  In this paper we consider the orbifold curve, which is a quotient of an\nelliptic curve $\\mathcal{E}$ by a cyclic group of order 4. We develop a\nsystematic way to obtain a Givental-type reconstruction of Gromov-Witten theory\nof the orbifold curve via the product of the Gromov-Witten theories of a point.\nThis is done by employing mirror symmetry and certain results in FJRW theory.\nIn particular, we present the particular Givental's action giving the CY/LG\ncorrespondence between the Gromov-Witten theory of the orbifold curve\n$\\mathcal{E} / \\mathbb{Z}_4$ and FJRW theory of the pair defined by the\npolynomial $x^4+y^4+z^2$ and the maximal group of diagonal symmetries. The\nmethods we have developed can easily be applied to other finite quotients of an\nelliptic curve. Using Givental's action we also recover this FJRW theory via\nthe product of the Gromov-Witten theories of a point. Combined with the CY/LG\naction we get a result in \"pure\" Gromov-Witten theory with the help of modern\nmirror symmetry conjectures.\n", "  Charged massive scalar fields are studied in the gravitational,\nelectromagnetic, dilaton, and axion fields of rotating linear dilaton black\nholes. In this geometry, we separate the covariant Klein-Gordon equation into\nradial and angular parts and obtain the exact solutions of both the equations\nin terms of the confluent Heun functions. Using the radial solution, we study\nthe problems of resonant frequencies, entropy/area quantization, and greybody\nfactor. We also analyze the behavior of the wave solutions near the event\nhorizon of the rotating linear dilaton black hole and derive its Hawking\ntemperature via the Damour-Ruffini-Sannan method.\n", "  We suggest that the holographic principle, combined with recent technological\nadvances in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, can lead to experimental\nstudies of quantum gravity. As a specific example, we consider the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which consists of spin-polarized fermions with\nan all-to-all complex random two-body hopping and has been conjectured to be\ndual to a certain quantum gravitational system. Achieving low-temperature\nstates of the SYK model is interpreted as a realization of a stringy black\nhole, provided that the holographic duality is true. We introduce a variant of\nthe SYK model, in which the random two-body hopping is real. This model is\nequivalent to the origincal SYK model in the large-$N$ limit. We show that this\nmodel can be created in principle by confining ultracold fermionic atoms into\noptical lattices and coupling two atoms with molecular states via\nphoto-association lasers. This development serves as an important first step\ntowards an experimental realization of such systems dual to quantum black\nholes. We also show how to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions of\nthe SYK model, which allow for identifying the maximally chaotic property of\nthe black hole.\n", "  Multi-layered networks represent a major advance in the description of\nnatural complex systems, and their study has shed light on new physical\nphenomena. Despite its importance, however, the role of the temporal dimension\nin their structure and function has not been investigated in much detail so\nfar. Here we study the temporal correlations between layers exhibited by real\nsocial multiplex networks. At a basic level, the presence of such correlations\nimplies a certain degree of predictability in the contact pattern, as we\nquantify by an extension of the entropy and mutual information analyses\nproposed for the single-layer case. At a different level, we demonstrate that\ntemporal correlations are a signature of a 'multitasking' behavior of network\nagents, characterized by a higher level of switching between different social\nactivities than expected in a uncorrelated pattern. Moreover, temporal\ncorrelations significantly affect the dynamics of coupled epidemic processes\nunfolding on the network. Our work opens the way for the systematic study of\ntemporal multiplex networks and we anticipate it will be of interest to\nresearchers in a broad array of fields.\n", "  We consider the Schroedinger operator with a complex delta interaction\nsupported by two parallel hypersurfaces in the Euclidean space of any\ndimension. We analyse spectral properties of the system in the limit when the\ndistance between the hypersurfaces tends to zero. We establish the\nnorm-resolvent convergence to a limiting operator and derive first-order\ncorrections for the corresponding eigenvalues.\n", "  Dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) in the space of trajectories are one of\nthe most intriguing phenomena of nonequilibrium physics, but their nature in\nrealistic high-dimensional systems remains puzzling. Here we observe for the\nfirst time a DPT in the current vector statistics of an archetypal\ntwo-dimensional (2d) driven diffusive system, and characterize its properties\nusing macroscopic fluctuation theory. The complex interplay among the external\nfield, anisotropy and vector currents in 2d leads to a rich phase diagram, with\ndifferent symmetry-broken fluctuation phases separated by lines of first- and\nsecond-order DPTs. Remarkably, different types of 1d order in the form of\njammed density waves emerge to hinder transport for low-current fluctuations,\nrevealing a connection between rare events and self-organized structures which\nenhance their probability.\n", "  An ability to completely customise the mode profile in an electromagnetic\nwaveguide would be a useful ability. Currently, the transverse mode profile in\na waveguide might be varied, but this is usually a side effect of design\nconstraints, or for control of dispersion. In contrast, here we show how to\ncontrol the longitudinal (propagation direction) mode profile on a\nsub-wavelength scale, but without the need for active solutions such as\nsynthesizing the shape by combining multiple Fourier harmonics. This is done by\nmeans of a customised permittivity variation that can be calculated either\ndirectly from the desired mode profile, or as inspired by e.g. the range of\nshapes generated by the Mathieu functions. For applications such as charged\nparticle beam dynamics, requiring field profile shaping in free space, we show\nthat it is possible to achieve this despite the need to cut a channel through\nthe medium.\n", "  Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski, and Sully argued that, for a consistent black\nhole evaporation process, the horizon of a sufficiently old black hole should\nbe replaced by a \"firewall\" at which an infalling observer burns up, which\nobviously leads to the violation of the equivalence principle. We propose that\nonce the infalling partner of an outgoing Hawking particle approaches a black\nhole singularity, it experiences decoherence and the loss of its entanglement\nwith the outgoing Hawking particle. This implies we would no longer need\nfirewalls to avoid the black hole information paradox.\n", "  We demonstrate cryogenic buffer-gas cooling of gas-phase methyltrioxorhenium\n(MTO). This molecule is closely related to chiral organometallic molecules\nwhere the parity-violating energy differences between enantiomers may be\nmeasurable. The molecules are produced with a rotational temperature of\napproximately 6~K by laser ablation of an MTO pellet inside a cryogenic helium\nbuffer gas cell. Facilitated by the low temperature, we demonstrate absorption\nspectroscopy of the 10.2~$\\mu$m antisymmetric Re=O stretching mode of MTO with\na resolution of 8~MHz and a frequency accuracy of 30~MHz. We partially resolve\nthe hyperfine structure and measure the nuclear quadrupole coupling of the\nexcited vibrational state.\n", "  We study the data on mean hadron yields and contrast the chemical freezeout\nconditions in p+p, p+Pb and Pb+Pb at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies.\nWe study several schemes for freezeout that mainly differ in the way\nstrangeness is treated: i. strangeness freezes out along with the non-strange\nhadrons in complete equilibrium (1CFO), ii. strangeness freezes out along with\nnon-strange hadrons with an additional parameter $\\gamma_S$ accounting for\nnon-equilibrium production of strangeness (1CFO+$\\gamma_S$), and iii.\nstrangeness freezes out earlier than non-strange hadrons and in thermal\nequilibrium (2CFO). A comparison of the chisquares of the fits indicate a\ndependence of the freezeout scheme on the system size. The minimum bias p+p and\ndifferent centralities of p+Pb and peripheral Pb+Pb data prefer 1CFO$+\\gamma_S$\nwith $\\gamma_S$ approaching unity as we go from p+p to central p+Pb and\nperipheral Pb+Pb. On the other hand, the mid-central to central Pb+Pb data\nprefer 2CFO over 1CFO+$\\gamma_S$. Such system size dependence of freezeout\nscheme could be an indication of the additional interaction in Pb+Pb over p+Pb\nand p+p.\n", "  The differential cross sections for inclusive production of B+ hadrons are\nmeasured as a function of the B+ transverse momentum pT[B] and rapidity y[B] in\npp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, using data collected by the\nCMS experiment that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 49.4 inverse\npicobarns. The measurement uses the exclusive decay channel B+ to J/psi K+,\nwith J/psi mesons that decay to a pair of muons. The results show a reasonable\nagreement with theoretical calculations within the uncertainties.\n", "  The rate at which nodes in evolving social networks acquire links (friends,\ncitations) shows complex temporal dynamics. Preferential attachment and link\ncopying models, while enabling elegant analysis, only capture rich-gets-richer\neffects, not aging and decline. Recent aging models are complex and heavily\nparameterized; most involve estimating 1-3 parameters per node. These\nparameters are intrinsic: they explain decline in terms of events in the past\nof the same node, and do not explain, using the network, where the linking\nattention might go instead. We argue that traditional characterization of\nlinking dynamics are insufficient to judge the faithfulness of models. We\npropose a new temporal sketch of an evolving graph, and introduce several new\ncharacterizations of a network's temporal dynamics. Then we propose a new\nfamily of frugal aging models with no per-node parameters and only two global\nparameters. Our model is based on a surprising inversion or undoing of triangle\ncompletion, where an old node relays a citation to a younger follower in its\nimmediate vicinity. Despite very few parameters, the new family of models shows\nremarkably better fit with real data. Before concluding, we analyze temporal\nsignatures for various research communities yielding further insights into\ntheir comparative dynamics. To facilitate reproducible research, we shall soon\nmake all the codes and the processed dataset available in the public domain.\n", "  We numerically study the local stress distribution within athermal,\nisotropically stressed, mechanically stable, packings of bidisperse\nfrictionless disks above the jamming transition in two dimensions. Considering\nthe Fourier transform of the local stress, we find evidence for algebraically\nincreasing fluctuations in both isotropic and anisotropic components of the\nstress tensor at small wavenumbers, contrary to recent theoretical predictions.\nSuch increasing fluctuations imply a lack of self-averaging of the stress on\nlarge length scales. The crossover to these increasing fluctuations defines a\nlength scale $\\ell_0$, however it appears that $\\ell_0$ does not vary much with\npacking fraction $\\phi$, nor does $\\ell_0$ seem to be diverging as $\\phi$\napproaches the jamming $\\phi_J$. We also find similar large length scale\nfluctuations of stress in the inherent states of a quenched Lennard-Jones\nliquid, leading us to speculate that such fluctuations may be a general\nproperty of amorphous solids in two dimensions.\n", "  We report exotic orbital phenomena of spinning test particles orbiting around\na Kerr black hole, i.e., some orbits of spinning particles are asymmetrical\nabout the equatorial plane. When a nonspinning test particle orbits around a\nKerr black hole in a strong field region, due to relativistic orbital\nprecessions, the pattern of trajectories is symmetrical about the equatorial\nplane of the Kerr black hole. However, the patterns of the spinning particles'\norbit are no longer symmetrical about the equatorial plane for some orbital\nconfigurations and large spins. We argue that these asymmetrical patterns come\nfrom the spin-spin interactions between spinning particles and Kerr black\nholes, because the directions of spin-spin forces can be arbitrary, and\ndistribute asymmetrically about the equatorial plane.\n", "  Network alignment is the problem of matching the nodes of two graphs,\nmaximizing the similarity of the matched nodes and the edges between them. This\nproblem is encountered in a wide array of applications-from biological networks\nto social networks to ontologies-where multiple networked data sources need to\nbe integrated. Due to the difficulty of the task, an accurate alignment can\nrarely be found without human assistance. Thus, it is of great practical\nimportance to develop network alignment algorithms that can optimally leverage\nexperts who are able to provide the correct alignment for a small number of\nnodes. Yet, only a handful of existing works address this active network\nalignment setting.\n  The majority of the existing active methods focus on absolute queries (\"are\nnodes $a$ and $b$ the same or not?\"), whereas we argue that it is generally\neasier for a human expert to answer relative queries (\"which node in the set\n$\\{b_1, \\ldots, b_n\\}$ is the most similar to node $a$?\"). This paper\nintroduces two novel relative-query strategies, TopMatchings and\nGibbsMatchings, which can be applied on top of any network alignment method\nthat constructs and solves a bipartite matching problem. Our methods identify\nthe most informative nodes to query by sampling the matchings of the bipartite\ngraph associated to the network-alignment instance.\n  We compare the proposed approaches to several commonly-used query strategies\nand perform experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our\nsampling-based strategies yield the highest overall performance, outperforming\nall the baseline methods by more than 15 percentage points in some cases. In\nterms of accuracy, TopMatchings and GibbsMatchings perform comparably. However,\nGibbsMatchings is significantly more scalable, but it also requires\nhyperparameter tuning for a temperature parameter.\n", "  We study a geometrically constrained coalescence model derived from spin\nsystems. Given two probability distributions $\\mathbb{P}_R$ and $\\mathbb{P}_B$\non the positive reals with finite means, colour the real line alternately with\nred and blue intervals so that the lengths of the red intervals have\ndistribution $\\mathbb{P}_R$, the lengths of the blue intervals have\ndistribution $\\mathbb{P}_B$, and distinct intervals have independent lengths.\nNow, iteratively update this colouring of the line by coalescing intervals:\nchange the colour of any interval that is surrounded by longer intervals so\nthat these three consecutive intervals subsequently form a single monochromatic\ninterval. We say that a colour (either red or blue) wins if every point of the\nline is eventually of that colour. Holroyd, in 2011, asked the following\nquestion: under what natural conditions on the initial distributions is one of\nthe colours almost surely guaranteed to win? It turns out that the answer to\nthis question can be quite counter-intuitive due to the non-monotone dynamics\nof the model. In this paper, we investigate various notions of advantage one of\nthe colours might initially possess, and in the course of doing so, we\ndetermine which of the two colours emerges victorious for various nontrivial\npairs of distributions.\n", "  We investigate the wave dynamics of a charged massive scalar field\npropagating in a maximally rotating (extremal) linear dilaton black hole\ngeometry. We prove the existence of a discrete and infinite family of\nresonances describing non-decaying stationary scalar configurations (clouds)\nenclosing these rapidly rotating black holes. The results obtained signal the\npotential stationary scalar field distributions (dark matter) around the\nextremal linear dilaton black holes. In particular, we analytically compute the\neffective heights of those clouds above the center of the black hole.\n", "  We investigate thermoelectric properties of a ferromagnet-superconductor\nhybrid structure with Rashba spin-orbit interaction and delta function\npotential barrier at the interfacial layer. The exponential rise of thermal\nconductance with temperature manifests a cross-over temperature scale\nseparating two opposite behaviors of it with the change of polarization in the\nferromagnet whereas the inclusion of interfacial Rashba spin-orbit field\nresults in a non-monotonic behavior of it with the strength of Rashba field. We\nemploy scattering matrix approach to determine the amplitudes of all the\nscattering processes possible at the interface to explain the thermoelectric\nproperties of the device. We examine Seebeck effect and show that higher\nthermopower can be achieved when the polarization of the ferromagnet tends\ntowards the half-metallic limit. It can be enhanced even for lower polarization\nin presence of the finite potential barrier. In presence of interfacial Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction, Seebeck coefficient rises with the increase of barrier\nstrength and polarization at weak or moderate interfacial Rashba field. From\nthe application perspective, we compute the figure of merit and show that\n$zT\\sim 4-5$ with higher polarization of the ferromagnet both in absence and\npresence of weak or moderate Rashba spin-orbit interaction along with the\nscalar potential barrier.\n", "  Many emerging quantum technologies demand precise engineering and control\nover networks consisting of quantum mechanical degrees of freedom connected by\npropagating electromagnetic fields, or quantum input-output networks. Here we\nreview recent progress in theory and experiment related to such quantum\ninput-output networks, with a focus on the SLH framework, a powerful modeling\nframework for networked quantum systems that is naturally endowed with\nproperties such as modularity and hierarchy. We begin by explaining the\nphysical approximations required to represent any individual node of a network,\neg. atoms in cavity or a mechanical oscillator, and its coupling to quantum\nfields by an operator triple $(S,L,H)$. Then we explain how these nodes can be\ncomposed into a network with arbitrary connectivity, including coherent\nfeedback channels, using algebraic rules, and how to derive the dynamics of\nnetwork components and output fields. The second part of the review discusses\nseveral extensions to the basic SLH framework that expand its modeling\ncapabilities, and the prospects for modeling integrated implementations of\nquantum input-output networks. In addition to summarizing major results and\nrecent literature, we discuss the potential applications and limitations of the\nSLH framework and quantum input-output networks, with the intention of\nproviding context to a reader unfamiliar with the field.\n", "  We study the asymptotic behavior, as $n\\to\\infty$, of ratios of Toeplitz\ndeterminants $D_n(e^h d\\mu)/D_n(d\\mu)$ defined by a measure $\\mu$ on the unit\ncircle and a sufficiently smooth function $h$. The approach we follow is based\non the theory of orthogonal polynomials. We prove that the second order\nasymptotics depends on $h$ and only a few Verblunsky coefficients associated to\n$\\mu$. As a result, we establish a relative version of the Strong Szeg\\H{o}\nLimit Theorem for a wide class of measures $\\mu$ with essential support on a\nsingle arc. In particular, this allows the measure to have a singular component\nwithin or outside of the arc.\n", "  We provide evidence of an extreme form of sensitivity to initial conditions\nin a family of one-dimensional self-ruling dynamical systems. We prove that\nsome hyperchaotic sequences are closed-form expressions of the orbits of these\npseudo-random dynamical systems. Each chaotic system in this family exhibits a\nsensitivity to initial conditions that encompasses the sequence of choices of\nthe evolution rule in some collection of maps. This opens a possibility to\nextend current theories of complex behaviors on the basis of intrinsic\nuncertainty in deterministic chaos.\n", "  Fundamentally binary theories are nonsignaling theories in which measurements\nof many outcomes are constructed by selecting from binary measurements. They\nconstitute a sensible alternative to quantum theory and have never been\ndirectly falsified by any experiment. Here we show that fundamentally binary\ntheories are experimentally testable with current technology. For that, we\nidentify a feasible Bell-type experiment on pairs of entangled qutrits. In\naddition, we prove that, for any n, quantum n-ary correlations are not\nfundamentally (n-1)-ary. For that, we introduce a family of inequalities that\nhold for fundamentally (n-1)-ary theories but are violated by quantum n-ary\ncorrelations.\n", "  In this paper we present a beautifully consistent web of evidence for the\nexistence of interacting 4d rank-1 $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs obtained from gauging\ndiscrete subgroups of global symmetries of other existing 4d rank-1\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs. The global symmetries that can be gauged involve a\nnon-trivial combination of discrete subgroups of the $U(1)_R$, low-energy EM\nduality group $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, and the outer automorphism group of the\nflavor symmetry algebra, Out($F$).\n  The theories that we construct are remarkable in many ways: (i) two of them\nhave exceptional $F_4$ and $G_2$ flavor groups; (ii) they substantially\ncomplete the picture of the landscape of rank-1 $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs as they\nrealize all but one of the remaining consistent rank-1 Seiberg-Witten\ngeometries that we previously constructed but were not associated to known\nSCFTs; and (iii) some of them have enlarged $\\mathcal{N}=3$ SUSY, and have not\nbeen previously constructed. They are also examples of SCFTs which violate the\nShapere-Tachikawa relation between the conformal central charges and the\nscaling dimension of the Coulomb branch vev. We propose a modification of the\nformulas computing these central charges from the topologically twisted Coulomb\nbranch partition function which correctly compute them for discretely gauged\ntheories.\n", "  We study the surface states of a strongly coupled Weyl semimetal within\nholography. By explicit numerical computation of an inhomogeneous holographic\nWeyl semimetal we observe the appearance of an electric current restricted to\nthe surface in presence of electric chemical potential. The total current is\nuniversal in the sense that it only depends on the topology of the phases\nshowing that the bulk-boundary correspondence holds even at strong coupling.\nThe implications of this result are subtle and may shed some light on anomalous\ntransport at weak coupling.\n", "  A number of exciting concepts are under development for Flagship, Probe\nclass, Explorer class, and Suborbital class NASA missions in the\nultraviolet/optical spectral ranges. These missions will depend on high\nperformance silicon detector arrays being delivered affordably and in high\nnumbers. In a focused effort we have advanced delta-doping technology to high\nthroughput and high yield wafer-scale processing, encompassing a multitude of\nstate-of-the-art silicon-based detector formats and designs. As part of this\ntechnology advancement and in preparation for upcoming missions, we have\nembarked on a number of field observations, instrument integrations, and\nindependent evaluations of delta-doped arrays. In this paper, we present recent\ndata and innovations from the Advanced Detectors and Systems program at JPL,\nincluding two-dimensional doping technology; our end-to-end post-fabrication\nprocessing of high performance UV/Optical/NIR arrays; and advanced coatings for\ndetectors and optical elements. Additionally, we present examples of past,\nin-progress, and planned observations and deployments of delta-doped arrays.\n", "  Recently, Guarino et al. found that dyonically-gauged N=8 supergravity arises\nas a consistent truncation of massive type IIA supergravity when the gauge\ngroup is chosen to be ISO(7). In particular, they found a critical point of the\nsupergravity that uplifted to the first explicit N = 2 $AdS_4$ massive IIA\nbackground. Its free energy was also calculated. Though no black brane\nsolutions for this theory have been constructed yet, we nevertheless expect the\nfree energy of the black brane solutions to scale with the same N dependence as\nthe solution obtained by Guarino et al.. In this note, we will reproduce the\nexotic N dependence of the free energy of such black brane solutions from field\ntheory at finite temperature using the Smilga-Wiseman approach. The free energy\nexpression thus obtained also tells us about the temperature dependence of free\nenergy of such black brane solutions in a given low temperature regime.\n", "  Wave scattering phenomena are ubiquitous to almost all Sciences, from Biology\nto Physics. When an incident wave scatters off of an obstacle, it is partially\nreflected and partially transmitted. Since the scatterer absorbs part of the\nincident energy, the reflected wave carries less energy than the incident one.\nHowever, if the obstacle is rotating, this process can be reversed and waves\ncan be amplified, extracting energy from the scatterer. Even though this\nphenomenon, known as superradiance, has been thoroughly analysed in several\ntheoretical scenarios (from eletromagnetic radiation scattering on a rotating\ncylinder to gravitational waves incident upon a rotating black hole), it has\nnever been observed. Here we describe in detail the first laboratory detection\nof superradiance. We observed that plane waves propagating on the surface of\nwater are amplified after being scattered by a draining vortex. The maximum\namplification measured in the experiment was 20%, obtained for 3.70 Hz waves,\nin a 6.25 cm deep fluid. Our results are consistent with superradiant\nscattering caused by rapid rotation. In particular, a draining fluid can\ntransfer part of its rotational energy to incident low-frequency waves. Our\nexperimental findings will shed new light on Black Hole Physics, since shallow\nwater waves scattering on a draining fluid constitute an analogue of a black\nhole. We believe, especially in view of the recent observations of\ngravitational waves, that our results will motivate further research (both\ntheoretical and experimental) on the observation of superradiance of\ngravitational waves.\n", "  We study the superfluid response, the energetic and structural properties of\na one-dimensional ultracold Bose gas in an optical lattice of arbitrary\nstrength. We use the Bose-Fermi mapping in the limit of infinitely large\nrepulsive interaction and the diffusion Monte Carlo method in the case of\nfinite interaction. For slightly incommensurate fillings we find a superfluid\nbehavior which is discussed in terms of vacancies and interstitials. It is\nshown that both the excitation spectrum and static structure factor are\ndifferent for the cases of microscopic and macroscopic fractions of defects.\nThis system provides a extremely well-controlled model for studying\ndefect-induced superfluidity.\n", "  We recently set a new limit on the electric dipole moment of the electron\n(eEDM) (J. Baron et al., ACME collaboration, Science 343 (2014), 269-272),\nwhich represented an order-of-magnitude improvement on the previous limit and\nplaced more stringent constraints on many CP-violating extensions to the\nStandard Model. In this paper we discuss the measurement in detail. The\nexperimental method and associated apparatus are described, together with the\ntechniques used to isolate the eEDM signal. In particular, we detail the way\nexperimental switches were used to suppress effects that can mimic the signal\nof interest. The methods used to search for systematic errors, and models\nexplaining observed systematic errors, are also described. We briefly discuss\npossible improvements to the experiment.\n", "  We study the spin-wave excitations in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ by the spin-wave\ntheory. Starting from the five-orbital Hubbard model and the perturbation\ntheory, we derive an effective isospin-$1/2$ model in the large Hubbard ($U$)\nlimit. Based on the energy-band structure calculated from the first-principle\nmethod, we find that the effective model can be further reduced to the\n$K$-$\\Gamma$ model containing a ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) Kitaev\ninteraction ($K$) and a NN off-diagonal exchange interaction ($\\Gamma$). With\nthe spin-wave theory, we find that the $K$-$\\Gamma$ model can give magnetic\nexcitations which is consistent with the recent neutron scattering experiments.\n", "  The distance to the planetary system OGLE-2015-BLG-0966L and the separation\nbetween the planet and its host star are ambiguous due to an ambiguity in the\ndistance to the source star (Street et al. 2016). We attempt to break this\ndegeneracy by measuring the systemic radial velocity of the source star\nmeasured from a spectrum taken while the source was highly magnified. Our\nmeasurement of v_{LSR} = 53 +/- 1 km s^{-1} does not definitively resolve the\nnature of the source, but supports the general conclusion that the source is in\nthe bulge. Although in this case the measured radial velocity was inconclusive,\nthis work demonstrates that even a low signal-to-noise spectrum can provide\nuseful information for characterizing microlensing source stars.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of the triangular-lattice $Q$-state Potts model in\nthe real $(Q,v)$-plane, where $v=e^J-1$ is the temperature variable. Our first\ngoal is to provide an obviously missing feature of this diagram: the position\nof the antiferromagnetic critical curve. This curve turns out to possess a\nbifurcation point with two branches emerging from it, entailing important\nconsequences for the global phase diagram. We have obtained accurate numerical\nestimates for the position of this curve by combining the transfer-matrix\napproach for strip graphs with toroidal boundary conditions and the recent\nmethod of critical polynomials. The second goal of this work is to study the\ncorresponding $A_{p-1}$ RSOS model on the torus, for integer $p=4,5,\\ldots,8$.\nWe clarify its relation to the corresponding Potts model, in particular\nconcerning the role of boundary conditions. For certain values of $p$, we\nidentify several new critical points and regimes for the RSOS model and we\ninitiate the study of the flows between the corresponding field theories.\n", "  Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), also known as amplitude modulated\n(AM) or AC mode, is a proven, reliable and gentle imaging mode with widespread\napplications. Over the several decades that tapping mode has been in use,\nquantification of tip-sample mechanical properties such as stiffness has\nremained elusive. Bimodal tapping mode keeps the advantages of single-frequency\ntapping mode while extending the technique by driving and measuring an\nadditional resonant mode of the cantilever. The simultaneously measured\nobservables of this additional resonance provide the additional information\nnecessary to extract quantitative nanomechanical information about the\ntip-sample mechanics. Specifically, driving the higher cantilever resonance in\na frequency modulated (FM) mode allows direct measurement of the tip-sample\ninteraction stiffness and, with appropriate modeling, the setpoint-independent\nlocal elastic modulus. Here we discuss the advantages of bimodal tapping,\ncoined AM-FM imaging, for modulus mapping. Results are presented for samples\nover a wide modulus range, from a compliant gel (~100 MPa) to stiff materials\n(~100 GPa), with the same type of cantilever. We also show high-resolution\n(sub-nanometer) stiffness mapping of individual molecules in semi-crystalline\npolymers and of DNA in fluid. Combined with the ability to remain quantitative\neven at line scan rates of nearly 40 Hz, the results demonstrate the\nversatility of AM-FM imaging for nanomechanical characterization in a wide\nrange of applications.\n", "  Complex networks have been found to provide a good representation of the\nstructure of knowledge, as understood in terms of discoverable concepts and\ntheir relationships. In this context, the discovery process can be modeled as\nagents walking in a knowledge space. Recent studies proposed more realistic\ndynamics, including the possibility of agents being influenced by others with\nhigher visibility or by their own memory. However, rather than dealing with\nthese two concepts separately, as previously approached, in this study we\npropose a multi-agent random walk model for knowledge acquisition that\nincorporates both concepts. More specifically, we employed the true self\navoiding walk alongside a new dynamics based on jumps, in which agents are\nattracted by the influence of others. That was achieved by using a L\\'evy\nflight influenced by a field of attraction emanating from the agents. In order\nto evaluate our approach, we use a set of network models and two real networks,\none generated from Wikipedia and another from the Web of Science. The results\nwere analyzed globally and by regions. In the global analysis, we found that\nmost of the dynamics parameters do not significantly affect the discovery\ndynamics. The local analysis revealed a substantial difference of performance\ndepending on the network regions where the dynamics are occurring. In\nparticular, the dynamics at the core of networks tend to be more effective. The\nchoice of the dynamics parameters also had no significant impact to the\nacquisition performance for the considered knowledge networks, even at the\nlocal scale.\n", "  Direct sampling of multi-dimensional systems with quantum Monte Carlo methods\nallows exact account of many-body effects or particle correlations. The most\nstraightforward approach to solve the Schr\\\"odinger equation, Diffusion Monte\nCarlo, has been used in several benchmark cases for other methods to pursue.\nIts robustness is based on direct sampling of a positive probability density\nfor diffusion in imaginary time. It has been argued that the corresponding real\ntime diffusion can not be realised, because the corresponding oscillating\ncomplex valued distribution can not be used to drive diffusion. Here, we\ndemonstrate that this can be done with a couple of tricks turning the\ndistribution piecewise positive and normalisable. This study is a proof of\nconcept demonstration using the well-known and transparent case:\none-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Furthermore, we show that our novel method\ncan be used to find not only the ground state but also excited states and even\nthe time evolution of a given wave function. Considering fermionic systems,\nthis method may turn out to be feasible for finding the wave function nodes.\n", "  We introduce the Lomonosov suite of high-resolution N-body cosmological\nsimulations covering a full box of size 32 $h^{-1}$ Mpc with low-mass\nresolution particles ($2\\times10^7$ $h^{-1}\\,M_\\odot$) and three zoom-in\nsimulations of overdense, underdense and mean density regions at much higher\nparticle resolution ($4\\times10^4$ $h^{-1}\\,M_\\odot$). The main purpose of this\nsimulation suite is to extend the concentration-mass relation of dark matter\nhalos down to masses below those typically available in large cosmological\nsimulations. The three different density regions available at higher resolution\nprovide a better understanding of the effect of the local environment on halo\nconcentration, known to be potentially important for small simulation boxes and\nsmall halo masses. Yet, we find the correction to be small in comparison with\nthe scatter of halo concentrations. We conclude that zoom simulations, despite\ntheir limited representativity of the volume of the Universe, can be\neffectively used for the measurement of halo concentrations at least at the\nhalo masses probed by our simulations. In any case, after a precise\ncharacterization of this effect, we develop a robust technique to extrapolate\nthe concentration values found in zoom simulations to larger volumes with\ngreater accuracy. All together, Lomonosov provides a measure of the\nconcentration-mass relation in the halo mass range $10^7-10^{10}$\n$h^{-1}\\,M_\\odot$ with superb halo statistics. This work represents a first\nimportant step to measure halo concentrations at intermediate, yet vastly\nunexplored halo mass scales, down to the smallest ones. All Lomonosov data and\nfiles are public for community's use.\n", "  Large-scale extragalactic magnetic fields may induce conversions between\nvery-high-energy photons and axionlike particles (ALPs), thereby shielding the\nphotons from absorption on the extragalactic background light. However, in\nsimplified \"cell\" models, used so far to represent extragalactic magnetic\nfields, this mechanism would be strongly suppressed by current astrophysical\nbounds. Here we consider a recent model of extragalactic magnetic fields\nobtained from large-scale cosmological simulations. Such simulated magnetic\nfields would have large enhancement in the filaments of matter. As a result,\nphoton-ALP conversions would produce a significant spectral hardening for\ncosmic TeV photons. This effect would be probed with the upcoming Cherenkov\nTelescope Array detector. This possible detection would give a unique chance to\nperform a tomography of the magnetized cosmic web with ALPs.\n", "  For any function $f: X \\times Y \\to Z$, we prove that $Q^{*\\text{cc}}(f)\n\\cdot Q^{\\text{OIP}}(f) \\cdot (\\log Q^{\\text{OIP}}(f) + \\log |Z|) \\geq\n\\Omega(\\log |X|)$. Here, $Q^{*\\text{cc}}(f)$ denotes the bounded-error\ncommunication complexity of $f$ using an entanglement-assisted two-way qubit\nchannel, and $Q^{\\text{OIP}}(f)$ denotes the number of quantum queries needed\nto learn $x$ with high probability given oracle access to the function $f_x(y)\n\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} f(x, y)$. We show that this tradeoff is close to the\nbest possible. We also give a generalization of this tradeoff for\ndistributional query complexity.\n  As an application, we prove an optimal $\\Omega(\\log q)$ lower bound on the\n$Q^{*\\text{cc}}$ complexity of determining whether $x + y$ is a perfect square,\nwhere Alice holds $x \\in \\mathbf{F}_q$, Bob holds $y \\in \\mathbf{F}_q$, and\n$\\mathbf{F}_q$ is a finite field of odd characteristic. As another application,\nwe give a new, simpler proof that searching an ordered size-$N$ database\nrequires $\\Omega(\\log N / \\log \\log N)$ quantum queries. (It was already known\nthat $\\Theta(\\log N)$ queries are required.)\n", "  We study 't Hooft anomalies of discrete groups in the framework of\n(1+1)-dimensional multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz states on the\nlattice. Using matrix product operators, general topological restrictions on\nconformal data are derived. An ansatz class allowing for optimization of MERA\nwith an anomalous symmetry is introduced. We utilize this class to numerically\nstudy a family of Hamiltonians with a symmetric critical line. Conformal data\nis obtained for all irreducible projective representations of each anomalous\nsymmetry twist, corresponding to definite topological sectors. It is\nnumerically demonstrated that this line is a protected gapless phase. Finally,\nwe implement a duality transformation between a pair of critical lines using\nour subclass of MERA.\n", "  We present a technique to compute the microcanonical thermodynamical\nproperties of a manybody quantum system using tensor networks. The Density Of\nStates (DOS), and more general spectral properties, are evaluated by means of a\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformation performed on top of a real-time evolution,\nwhich is carried out via numerical methods based on tensor networks. As a\nconsequence, the free energy and thermal averages can be also calculated. We\ntest this approach on the one-dimensional Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models. Using\nmatrix product states, we show that the thermodynamical quantities as a\nfunction of temperature are in very good agreement with the exact results. This\napproach can be extended to higher-dimensional system by properly employing\nother types of tensor networks.\n", "  We present analytic self-similar solutions for the one, two and three\ndimensional Madelung hydrodynamical equation for a free particle. There is a\ndirect connection between the zeros of the Madelung fluid density and the\nmagnitude of the quantum potential.\n", "  Attitudes can have a profound impact on socially relevant behaviours, such as\nvoting. However, this effect is not uniform across situations or individuals,\nand it is at present difficult to predict whether attitudes will predict\nbehaviour in any given circumstance. Using a network model, we demonstrate that\n(a) more strongly connected attitude networks have a stronger impact on\nbehaviour, and (b) within any given attitude network, the most central attitude\nelements have the strongest impact. We test these hypotheses using data on\nvoting and attitudes toward presidential candidates in the US presidential\nelections from 1980 to 2012. These analyses confirm that the predictive value\nof attitude networks depends almost entirely on their level of connectivity,\nwith more central attitude elements having stronger impact. The impact of\nattitudes on voting behaviour can thus be reliably determined before elections\ntake place by using network analyses.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the effect of strong electronic interactions on\nthe thermoelectric properties of a simple generic system, consisting of a\nsingle correlated layer sandwiched between two metallic leads. Results will be\ngiven for the linear response regime as well as beyond, for which a full\nnonequilibrium many-body calculation is performed, based on nonequilibrium\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). As impurity solver we use the auxiliary\nmaster equation approach, which addresses the impurity problem within a finite\nauxiliary system consisting of a correlated impurity, a small number of\nuncorrelated bath sites and Markovian environments. For the linear response\nregime, results will be presented for the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical\nconductance and the electronic contribution to the thermal conductance. Beyond\nlinear response, i.e. for finite differences in the temperatures and/or the\nbias voltages in the leads, we study the dependence of the current on various\nmodel parameters, such as gate voltage and Hubbard interaction of the central\nlayer. We will give a detailed parameter study as far as the thermoelectric\nefficiency is concerned. We find that strong correlations can indeed increase\nthe thermopower of the device. In addition, some general theoretical\nrequirements for an efficient thermoelectric device will be given.\n", "  In this paper, a general bright-dark soliton solution in the form of Pfaffian\nis constructed for an integrable semi-discrete vector NLS equation via Hirota's\nbilinear method. One- and two-bright-dark soliton solutions are explicitly\npresented for two-component semi-discrete NLS equation; two-bright-one-dark,\nand one-bright-two-dark soliton solutions are also given explicitly for\nthree-component semi-discrete NLS equation. The asymptotic behavior is analysed\nfor two-soliton solutions.\n", "  Ultracold atomic gases have realised numerous paradigms of condensed matter\nphysics where control over interactions has crucially been afforded by tunable\nFeshbach resonances. So far, the characterisation of these Feshbach resonances\nhas almost exclusively relied on experiments in the threshold regime near zero\nenergy. Here we use a laser-based collider to probe a narrow magnetic Feshbach\nresonance of rubidium above threshold. By measuring the overall atomic loss\nfrom colliding clouds as a function of magnetic field, we track the\nenergy-dependent resonance position. At higher energy, our collider scheme\nbroadens the loss feature, making the identification of the narrow resonance\nchallenging. However, we observe that the collisions give rise to shifts in the\ncentre-of-mass positions of outgoing clouds. The shifts cross zero at the\nresonance and this allows us to accurately determine its location well above\nthreshold. Our inferred resonance positions are in excellent agreement with\ntheory.\n", "  A data sample of events from proton-proton collisions with two isolated\nsame-sign leptons, missing transverse momentum, and jets is studied in a search\nfor signatures of new physics phenomena by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC.\nThe data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 inverse femtobarns, and\na center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The properties of the events are consistent\nwith expectations from standard model processes, and no excess yield is\nobserved. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are set on cross sections\nfor the pair production of gluinos, squarks, and same-sign top quarks, as well\nas top-quark associated production of a heavy scalar or pseudoscalar boson\ndecaying to top quarks, and on the standard model production of events with\nfour top quarks. The observed lower mass limits are as high as 1500 GeV for\ngluinos, 830 GeV for bottom squarks. The excluded mass range for heavy\n(pseudo)scalar bosons is 350-360 (350-410) GeV. Additionally, model-independent\nlimits in several topological regions are provided, allowing for further\ninterpretations of the results.\n", "  In this work a novel method to quantify spectral ergodicity for random\nmatrices is presented. The new methodology combines approaches rooted in the\nmetrics of Thirumalai-Mountain (TM) and Kullbach-Leibler (KL) divergence. The\nmethod is applied to a general study of deep and recurrent neural networks via\nthe analysis of random matrix ensembles mimicking typical weight matrices of\nthose systems. In particular, we examine circular random matrix ensembles:\ncircular unitary ensemble (CUE), circular orthogonal ensemble (COE), and\ncircular symplectic ensemble (CSE). Eigenvalue spectra and spectral ergodicity\nare computed for those ensembles as a function of network size. It is observed\nthat as the matrix size increases the level of spectral ergodicity of the\nensemble rises, i.e., the eigenvalue spectra obtained for a single realisation\nat random from the ensemble is closer to the spectra obtained averaging over\nthe whole ensemble. Based on previous results we conjecture that success of\ndeep learning architectures is strongly bound to the concept of spectral\nergodicity. The method to compute spectral ergodicity proposed in this work\ncould be used to optimise the size and architecture of deep as well as\nrecurrent neural networks.\n", "  Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and symmetric informationally complete (SIC)\npositive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) are two related topics in quantum\ninformation theory. They are generalized to mutually unbiased measurements\n(MUMs) and general symmetric informationally complete (GSIC) measurements,\nrespectively, that are both not necessarily rank 1. We study the quantum\nseparability problem by using these measurements and present separability\ncriteria for bipartite systems with arbitrary dimensions and multipartite\nsystems of multi-level subsystems. These criteria are proved to be more\neffective than previous criteria especially when the dimensions of the\nsubsystems are different. Furthermore, full quantum state tomography is not\nneeded when these criteria are implemented in experiment.\n", "  The terms \"acoustic/elastic meta-materials\" describe a class of periodic\nstructures with unit cells exhibiting local resonance. This localized resonant\nstructure has been shown to result in negative effective stiffness and/or mass\nat frequency ranges close to these local resonances. As a result, these\nstructures present unusual wave propagation properties at wavelengths well\nbelow the regime corresponding to band-gap generation based on spatial\nperiodicity, (i.e. \"Bragg scattering\"). Therefore, acoustic/elastic\nmeta-materials can lead to applications, especially suitable in the\nlow-frequency range. However, low frequency range applications of such\nmeta-materials require very heavy internal moving masses, as well as additional\nconstraints at the amplitudes of the internally oscillating locally resonating\nstructures, which may prohibit their practical implementation. In order to\nresolve this disadvantage, the K-Damping concept will be analyzed. According to\nthis concept, the acoustic/elastic meta-materials are designed to include\nnegative stiffness elements instead or in addition to the internally resonating\nadded masses. This concept removes the need for the heavy locally added heavy\nmasses, while it simultaneously exploits the negative stiffness damping\nphenomenon. Application of both Bloch's theory and the classical modal analysis\nat the one-dimensional mass-in-mass lattice is analyzed and corresponding\ndispersion relations are derived. The results indicate significant advantages\nover the conventional mass-in-a mass lattice, such as broader band-gaps and\nincreased damping ratio and reveal significant potential in the proposed\nsolution. Preliminary feasibility analysis for seismic meta-structures and low\nfrequency acoustic isolation-damping confirm the strong potential and\napplicability of this concept.\n", "  The light-cone spreading of entanglement and correlation is a fundamental and\nubiquitous feature of homogeneous extended quantum systems. Here we point out\nthat a class of inhomogenous Luttinger liquids (those with a uniform Luttinger\nparameter $K$) at low energy display the universal phenomenon of curved light\ncones: gapless excitations propagate along the geodesics of the metric\n$ds^2=dx^2+v(x)^2 d\\tau^2$, with $v(x)$ being the calculable spatial dependent\nvelocity induced by the inhomogeneity. We confirm our findings with explicit\nanalytic and numerical calculations both in- and out-of-equilibrium for a\nTonks-Girardeau gas in a harmonic potential and in lattice systems with\nartificially tuned hamiltonian density.\n", "  Motivated by an important recent experiment [Deng et al., Science 354, 1557\n(2016)], we theoretically consider the interplay between Andreev bound\nstates(ABSs) and Majorana bound states(MBSs) in quantum dot-nanowire\nsemiconductor systems with proximity-induced superconductivity(SC), spin-orbit\ncoupling and Zeeman splitting. The dot induces ABSs in the SC nanowire which\nshow complex behavior as a function of Zeeman splitting and chemical potential,\nand the specific question is whether two such ABSs can come together forming a\ntopological MBS. We consider physical situations involving the dot being\nnon-SC, SC, or partially SC. We find that the ABSs indeed tend to coalesce\ntogether producing near-zero-energy midgap states as Zeeman splitting and/or\nchemical potential are increased, but this mostly happens in the\nnon-topological regime although there are situations where the ABSs could come\ntogether forming a topological MBS. The two scenarios(two ABSs forming a\nnear-zero-energy non-topological ABS or a zero-energy topological MBS) are\ndifficult to distinguish by tunneling conductance spectroscopy due to\nessentially the same signatures. Theoretically we distinguish them by knowing\nthe critical Zeeman splitting for the topological quantum phase transition or\nby calculating the topological visibility. We find that the \"sticking together\"\npropensity of ABSs to produce a zero-energy midgap state is generic in class D\nsystems, and by itself says nothing about the topological nature of the\nunderlying SC nanowire. One must use caution in interpreting tunneling\nconductance measurements where the midgap sticking-together behavior of ABSs\ncannot be construed as definitive evidence for topological SC with non-Abelian\nMBSs. We also suggest some experimental techniques for distinguishing between\ntrivial and topological ZBCPs.\n", "  We propose a simple injective resolution for the Hochschild complex of the\nWeyl algebra. By making use of this resolution, we derive explicit expressions\nfor nontrivial cocycles of the Weyl algebra with coefficients in twisted\nbimodules as well as for the smash products of the Weyl algebra and a finite\ngroup of linear symplectic transformations. A relationship with the higher-spin\nfield theory is briefly discussed.\n", "  We generalize the recently introduced TRILEX approach (TRiply Irreducible\nLocal EXpansion) to superconducting phases. The method treats simultaneously\nMott and spin-fluctuation physics using an Eliashberg theory supplemented by\nlocal vertex corrections determined by a self-consistent quantum impurity\nmodel. We show that, in the two-dimensional Hubbard model, at strong coupling,\nTRILEX yields a $d$-wave superconducting dome as a function of doping. Contrary\nto the standard cluster dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) approaches, TRILEX\ncan capture $d$-wave pairing using only a single-site effective impurity model.\nWe also systematically explore the dependence of the superconducting\ntemperature on the bare dispersion at weak coupling, which shows a clear link\nbetween strong antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations and the onset of\nsuperconductivity. We identify a combination of hopping amplitudes particularly\nfavorable to superconductivity at intermediate doping. Finally, we study within\n$GW$+EDMFT the low-temperature $d$-wave superconducting phase at strong\ncoupling in a region of parameter space with reduced AF fluctuations.\n", "  We propose three-dimensional carbon (3D-C) structures based on the\nArchimedean lattices (ALs) by combining $sp^2$ bonding in the polygon edges and\n$sp^3$ bonding in the polygon vertices. By first-principles calculations, four\ntypes of 3D-C ALs: (4, $8^2$), (3, $12^2$), ($6^3$), and ($4^4$) 3D-Cs are\npredicted to be stable both dynamically and mechanically among 11 possible ALs.\nDepending on the index of ALs, the 3D-C ALs show distinctive electronic\nproperties: the (4, $8^2$) 3D-C is an indirect bandgap semiconductor, the (3,\n$12^2$) 3D-C is semimetal, while the ($6^3$) and ($4^4$) 3D-Cs are metals.\nConsidering the structural deformation due to the changes in their electronic\nenergy bands, we discuss the electromechanical properties of the 3D-C ALs as a\nfunction of charge doping. We find a semiconductor-to-metal and\nsemimetallic-to-semiconductor transitions in the (4, $8^2$) and (3, $12^2$)\n3D-Cs as a function of charge doping, respectively. Moreover, the (3, $12^2$)\n3D-C exhibits a $sp^2$-$sp^3$ phase transformation at high charge doping, which\nleads to a huge 30% irreversible strain, while the reversible strain in the (4,\n$8^2$) 3D-C is up to 9%, and thus they are quite promising for\nelectromechanical actuators.\n", "  This paper presents a study of the production of $WW$ or $WZ$ boson pairs,\nwith one $W$ boson decaying to $e\\nu$ or $\\mu\\nu$ and one $W$ or $Z$ boson\ndecaying hadronically. The analysis uses 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV\n$pp$ collision data, collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron\nCollider. Cross-sections for $WW/WZ$ production are measured in high-$p_{T}$\nfiducial regions defined close to the experimental event selection. The\ncross-section is measured for the case where the hadronically decaying boson is\nreconstructed as two resolved jets, and the case where it is reconstructed as a\nsingle jet. The transverse momentum distribution of the hadronically decaying\nboson is used to search for new physics. Observations are consistent with the\nStandard Model predictions, and $95\\%$ confidence intervals are calculated for\nparameters describing anomalous triple gauge-boson couplings.\n", "  Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the thin-film\nFeSe/SrTiO$_3$ system, iron selenide and its derivates have been intensively\nscrutinized. Using ab initio density functional theory calculations we review\nthe electronic structures that could be realized in iron-selenide if the\nstructural parameters could be tuned at liberty. We calculate the\nmomentum-dependence of the susceptibility and investigate the symmetry of\nelectron pairing within the random phase approximation. Both the susceptibility\nand the symmetry of electron pairing depend on the structural parameters in a\nnontrivial way. These results are consistent with the known experimental\nbehavior of binary iron chalcogenides and, at the same time, reveal two\npromising new ways of tuning superconducting transition temperatures in these\nmaterials. On the one hand by expanding the iron lattice of FeSe at constant\niron-selenium distance and, on the other hand, by increasing the iron-selenium\ndistance with unchanged iron lattice.\n", "  The inference of network topologies from relational data is an important\nproblem in data analysis. Exemplary applications include the reconstruction of\nsocial ties from data on human interactions, the inference of gene\nco-expression networks from DNA microarray data, or the learning of semantic\nrelationships based on co-occurrences of words in documents. Solving these\nproblems requires techniques to infer significant links in noisy relational\ndata. In this short paper, we propose a new statistical modeling framework to\naddress this challenge. It builds on generalized hypergeometric ensembles, a\nclass of generative stochastic models that give rise to analytically tractable\nprobability spaces of directed, multi-edge graphs. We show how this framework\ncan be used to assess the significance of links in noisy relational data. We\nillustrate our method in two data sets capturing spatio-temporal proximity\nrelations between actors in a social system. The results show that our\nanalytical framework provides a new approach to infer significant links from\nrelational data, with interesting perspectives for the mining of data on social\nsystems.\n", "  We study the rectification of a two-dimensional thermal gas in a channel of\nasymmetric dissipative walls. For an ensemble of smooth Lennard-Jones\nparticles, our numerical simulations reveal a non-monotonic dependence of the\nflux on the thermostat temperature, channel asymmetry, and particle density,\nwith three distinct regimes. Theoretical arguments are developed to shed light\non the functional dependence of the flux on the model parameters.\n", "  We theoretically consider the observed soft gap in the proximity-induced\nsuperconducting state of semiconductor nanowires in the presence of spin-orbit\ncoupling, Zeeman splitting, and tunneling leads, but in the absence of any\nextrinsic disorder. We critically consider the effects of three distinct\nintrinsic physical mechanisms (tunnel barrier to normal leads, temperature, and\ndissipation) on the phenomenology of the gap softness in the tunnel\nspectroscopy of the normal-superconductor junction as a function of spin\nsplitting and chemical potential. We find that all three mechanisms\nindividually can produce a soft gap, leading to calculated conductance spectra\nqualitatively mimicking experimental results. We also show that the\nphenomenology of the soft gap is intrinsically tied to the broadening and the\nheight of the Majorana zero mode(MZM)-induced differential conductance peak\nabove the topological quantum phase transition point with both the soft gap and\nthe quality of the MZM being simultaneously affected by tunnel barrier,\ntemperature, and dissipation. We establish that the MZM splitting oscillations\ncan be suppressed by temperature or dissipation, but not by the tunnel barrier.\nSince all three mechanisms are likely to be present in any realistic nanowires,\ndiscerning the effects of various mechanisms is difficult, necessitating\ndetailed experimental data as a function of all the system parameters, some of\nwhich (e.g., dissipation, chemical potential, tunnel barrier) may not be known\nexperimentally. While the tunneling-induced soft-gap behavior is benign with no\ndirect adverse effect on the Majorana topological properties with the zero-bias\npeak remaining quantized at $2e^2/h$, the soft gap induced by finite\ntemperature and/or finite dissipation is detrimental to topological properties\nand must be avoided as much as possible.\n", "  In this work, we propose using real quaternions for the definition of the\ntime interval resulting in an alternative formulation of the relativistic\nspace-time. We proceed with the quaternion definition of the particle mass that\nwe derive using the mass-energy equivalence. This results in the quaternion\nmass dispersion relation, which is equivalent to the relativistic\nenergy-momentum dispersion, however, with a positive quadratic norm of the\nresulting quaternion space. Then, we define the quaternion particle velocity,\nwhich can be applied to relativistic particles and electrons in non-parabolic\nsolid-state materials. We show that the relativistic Lorentz expressions apply\nonly to the absolute values of the time, mass and velocity while the physical\n4-vector quantities are described by real quaternions. Finally, we introduce\nthe quaternion electromagnetic potential and demonstrate that it has an effect\non the particle mass and velocity. In particular, we show a direct connection\nbetween the electrostatic potential and the particle rest mass. We compare the\npresent model to experimental measurements of the electron velocity in InSb\nwhere we demonstrate quasi-relativistic electron velocity saturation at high\nelectric fields. Therefore, it appears that physical quantities can be\nexpressed by real quaternions while their measured observables and relativistic\nLorentz transformations correspond to the quaternion absolute values. It seems\nthat the quaternion approach presented here can be used as a basis for an\nalternative mathematical description of particle physics.\n", "  The onset of binding $\\eta$(548) mesons in nuclei is studied in the He\nisotopes by doing precise $\\eta NNN$ and $\\eta NNNN$ few-body stochastic\nvariational method calculations for two semi-realistic $NN$ potentials and two\nenergy dependent $\\eta N$ potentials derived from coupled-channel models of the\n$N^{\\ast}(1535)$ nucleon resonance. The energy dependence of the $\\eta N$\nsubthreshold input is treated self consistently. It is found that a minimal\nvalue of the real part of the $\\eta N$ scattering length $a_{\\eta N}$ close to\n1 fm is required to bind $\\eta$ mesons in $^3$He, yielding then a few MeV\n$\\eta$ binding in $^4$He. The onset of $\\eta$-meson binding in $^4$He requires\nthat Re$\\,a_{\\eta N}$ exceeds 0.7 fm approximately. These results compare well\nwith results of recent $\\eta NNN$ and $\\eta NNNN$ pionless effective field\ntheory calculations. Related optical-model calculations are also discussed.\n", "  In these four lectures, aiming at senior undergraduate and junior graduate\nPhysics and Mathematics students, basic elements of the theory of elliptic\nfunctions are presented. Simple applications in classical mechanics are\ndiscussed, including a point particle in a cubic, sinusoidal or hyperbolic\npotential, as well as simple applications in quantum mechanics, namely the n=1\nLame potential. These lectures were given at the School of Applied Mathematics\nand Physical Sciences of the National Technical University of Athens in May\n2017.\n", "  A phase-demodulation method for digital fringe-projection profilometry using\nthe spatial and temporal Nyquist frequencies is presented. It allows us to\ndigitize tridimensional surfaces using the highest spatial frequency ({\\pi}\nradians per pixel) and consequently with the highest sensitivity for a given\ndigital fringe projector. Working with the highest temporal frequency ({\\pi}\nradians per temporal sample), the proposed method rejects the DC component and\nall even-order distorting harmonics using a bare-minimum 2-step phase shift.\nThe proposed method is suitable for digitization of piece-wise continuous\nsurfaces because it does not require spatial low-pass filtering. Gamma\ncalibration is unnecessary because the projected fringes are binary, and the\nharmonics produced by the binary profile can be easily attenuated with a slight\ndefocusing on the digital projector. Viability of the proposed method is\nsupported by experimental results showing complete agreement with the predicted\nbehavior.\n", "  The current $>3\\sigma$ tension between the Hubble constant $H_0$ measured\nfrom local distance indicators and from cosmic microwave background is one of\nthe most highly debated issues in cosmology, as it possibly indicates new\nphysics or unknown systematics. In this work, we explore whether this tension\ncan be alleviated by the sample variance in the local measurements, which use a\nsmall fraction of the Hubble volume. We use a large-volume cosmological\n$N$-body simulation to model the local measurements and to quantify the\nvariance due to local density fluctuations and sample selection. We explicitly\ntake into account the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of type Ia supernovae.\nDespite the faithful modelling of the observations, our results confirm\nprevious findings that sample variance in the local Hubble constant $(H_0^{\\rm\nloc})$ measurements is small; we find $\\sigma(H_0^{\\rm loc})=0.31\\,{\\rm km\\\ns^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$, a nearly negligible fraction of the $\\sim6\\,{\\rm km\\\ns^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$ necessary to explain the difference between the local and the\nglobal $H_0$ measurements. While the $H_0$ tension could in principle be\nexplained by our local neighbourhood being a underdense region of radius $\\sim\n150 \\,\\rm Mpc$ , the extreme required underdensity of such a void\n$(\\delta\\simeq -0.8)$ makes it very unlikely in a $\\Lambda$CDM universe, and it\nalso violates existing observational constraints. Therefore, sample variance in\na $\\Lambda$CDM universe cannot appreciably alleviate the tension in $H_0$\nmeasurements even after taking into account the inhomogeneous selection of type\nIa supernovae.\n", "  We propose and analyse a scheme for performing a long-range entangling gate\nfor qubits encoded in electron spins trapped in semiconductor quantum dots. Our\ncoupling makes use of an electrostatic interaction between the state-dependent\ncharge configurations of a singlet-triplet qubit and the edge modes of a\nquantum Hall droplet. We show that distant singlet-triplet qubits can be\nselectively coupled, with gate times that can be much shorter than qubit\ndephasing times and faster than decoherence due to coupling to the edge modes.\nBased on parameters from recent experiments, we argue that fidelities above 99%\ncould in principle be achieved for a two-qubit entangling gate taking as little\nas 20 ns.\n", "  Ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are a highly promising\nplatform for high-sensitivity magnetometry, whose efficacy is often based on\nefficiently generating and monitoring magnetic-field dependent infrared\nfluorescence. Here we report on an increased sensing efficiency with the use of\na 532-nm resonant confocal cavity and a microwave resonator antenna for\nmeasuring the local magnetic noise density using the intrinsic nitrogen-vacancy\nconcentration of a chemical-vapor deposited single-crystal diamond. We measure\na near-shot-noise-limited magnetic noise floor of 200 pT/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$\nspanning a bandwidth up to 159 Hz, and an extracted sensitivity of\napproximately 3 nT/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$, with further enhancement limited by the\nnoise floor of the lock-in amplifier and the laser damage threshold of the\noptical components. Exploration of the microwave and optical pump-rate\nparameter space demonstrates a linewidth-narrowing regime reached by virtue of\nusing the optical cavity, allowing an enhanced sensitivity to be achieved,\ndespite an unoptimized collection efficiency of <2 %, and a low\nnitrogen-vacancy concentration of about 0.2 ppb.\n", "  Axion-photon conversion at dielectric interfaces, immersed in a\nnear-homogeneous magnetic field, is the basis for the dielectric haloscope\nmethod to search for axion dark matter. In analogy to transition radiation,\nthis process is possible because the photon wave function is modified by the\ndielectric layers (\"Garibian wave function\") and is no longer an eigenstate of\nmomentum. A conventional first-order perturbative calculation of the transition\nprobability between a quantized axion state and these distorted photon states\nprovides the microwave production rate. It agrees with previous results based\non solving the classical Maxwell equations for the combined system of axions\nand electromagnetic fields. We argue that in general the average photon\nproduction rate is given by our result, independently of the detailed quantum\nstate of the axion field. Moreover, our result provides a new perspective on\naxion-photon conversion in dielectric haloscopes because the rate is based on\nan overlap integral between unperturbed axion and photon wave functions, in\nanalogy to the usual treatment of microwave-cavity haloscopes.\n", "  The delocalization error of popular density functional approximations (DFAs)\nleads to diversified problems in present-day density functional theory\ncalculations. For achieving a universal elimination of delocalization error, we\ndevelop a localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) framework, which unifies\nour previously proposed global and local scaling approaches. The LOSC framework\naccurately characterizes the distributions of global and local fractional\nelectrons, and is thus capable of correcting system energy, energy derivative\nand electron density in a self-consistent and size-consistent manner. The\nLOSC-DFAs lead to systematically improved results, including the dissociation\nof cationic species, the band gaps of molecules and polymer chains, the energy\nand density changes upon electron addition and removal, and photoemission\nspectra.\n", "  Despite many attempts, ordered equilibrium microphases have yet to be\nobtained in experimental colloidal suspensions. The recent computation of the\nequilibrium phase diagram of a microscopic, particle-based microphase former\n[Zhuang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 098301 (2016)] has nonetheless found such\nmesoscale assemblies to be thermodynamically stable. Here, we consider their\nequilibrium and assembly dynamics. At intermediate densities above the\norder-disorder transition, we identify four different dynamical regimes and the\nstructural changes that underlie the dynamical crossovers from one disordered\nregime to the next. Below the order-disorder transition, we also find that\nperiodic lamellae are the most dynamically accessible of the periodic\nmicrophases. Our analysis thus offers a comprehensive view of the disordered\nmicrophase dynamics and a route to the assembly of periodic microphases in a\nputative well-controlled, experimental system.\n", "  Covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) are intriguing platforms for designing\nfunctional molecular materials. Here, we present a computational study based on\nvan der Waals dispersion-corrected hybrid density functional theory (DFT-D) to\ndesign boroxine-linked and triazine-linked COFs intercalated with Fe. Keeping\nthe original $P-6m2$ symmetry of the pristine COF (COF-Fe-0), we have\ncomputationally designed seven new COFs by intercalating Fe atoms between two\norganic layers. The equilibrium structures and electronic properties of both\nthe pristine and Fe-intercalated COF materials are investigated here. We\npredict that the electronic properties of COFs can be fine tuned by adding Fe\natoms between two organic layers in their structures. Our calculations show\nthat these new intercalated-COFs are promising semiconductors. The effect of Fe\natoms on the electronic band structures and density of states (DOSs) has also\nbeen investigated using the aforementioned DFT-D method. The contribution of\nthe $d$-subshell electron density of the Fe atoms plays an important role in\nimproving the semiconductor properties of these new materials. These\nintercalated-COFs provide a new strategy to create semi-conducting materials\nwithin a rigid porous network in a highly controlled and predictable manner.\n", "  We propose an analytical technique to study large fluctuations and switching\nfrom internal noise in complex networks. Using order-disorder kinetics as a\ngeneric example, we construct and analyze the most probable, or optimal path of\nfluctuations from one ordered state to another in real and synthetic networks.\nThe method allows us to compute the distribution of large fluctuations and the\ntime scale associated with switching between ordered states for networks\nconsistent with mean-field assumptions. In general, we quantify how network\nheterogeneity influences the scaling patterns and probabilities of\nfluctuations. For instance, we find that the probability of a large fluctuation\nnear an order-disorder transition decreases exponentially with the\nparticipation ratio of a network's principle eigenvector -- measuring how many\nnodes effectively contribute to an ordered state. Finally, the proposed theory\nis used to answer how and where a network should be targeted in order to\noptimize the time needed to observe a switch.\n", "  The entire S-matrix elements of four, five and six point functions of\nD-brane-anti D-brane system are explored. To deal with symmetries of string\namplitudes as well as their all order $\\alpha'$ corrections we first address a\nfour point function of one closed string Ramond-Ramond (RR) and two real\ntachyons on the world volume of brane-anti brane system. We then focus on\nsymmetries of string theory as well as universal tachyon expansion to achieve\nboth string and effective field theory of an RR and three tachyons where the\ncomplete algebraic analysis for the whole S-matrix $<V_{C^{-1}} V_{T^{-1}}\nV_{T^{0}}V_{T^{0}} >$ was also revealed. Lastly, we employ all the conformal\nfield theory techniques to $<V_{C^{-1}} V_{T^{-1}} V_{T^{0}}V_{T^{0}}\nV_{T^{0}}>$, working out with symmetries of theory and find out the expansion\nfor the amplitude to be able to precisely discover all order singularity\nstructures of D-brane-anti-D-brane effective actions of string theory. Various\nremarks about the so called generalized Veneziano amplitude and new string\ncouplings are elaborated as well.\n", "  We propose a new approach to constructing a phase diagram using the effective\nHamiltonian derived only from a single real-space image produced by scanning\ntunneling microscopy (STM). Currently, there have been two main methods to\nconstruct phase diagrams in material science: ab initio calculations and\nCALPHAD with thermodynamic information obtained by experiments and/or\ntheoretical calculations. Although the two methods have successfully revealed a\nnumber of unsettled phase diagrams, their results sometimes contradicted when\nit is difficult to construct an appropriate Hamiltonian that captures the\ncharacteristics of materials, e.g., for a system consisting of multiple-scale\nobjects whose interactions are essential to the system's characteristics.\nMeanwhile, the advantage of our approach over existing methods is that it can\ndirectly and uniquely determine the effective Hamiltonian without any\nthermodynamic information. The validity of our approach is demonstrated through\nan Mg--Zn--Y long-period stacking-ordered structure, which is a challenging\nsystem for existing methods, leading to contradictory results. Our result\nsuccessfully reproduces the ordering tendency seen in STM images that previous\ntheoretical study failed to reproduce and clarifies its previously unknown\nphase diagram. Thus, our approach can be used to clear up contradictions shown\nby existing methods.\n", "  Unique properties of lead chalcogenides have enabled multiple exciton\ngeneration (MEG) in their nanocrystals that can be beneficial in enhancing the\nefficiency of the third generation solar cells. Although the intrinsic electric\nfield plays an imperative role in a solar cell, its effect on the multiple\nexciton generation (MEG) has been overlooked, so far. Using EOM-CCSD as a\nmany-body approach, we show that any electric field can affect the absorptivity\nspectra of the lead chalcogenide nanocrystals (Pb4Te4, Pb4Se4, and Pb4S4). The\nsame electric field, however, has insignificant effects on the MEG quantum\nprobabilities and the thresholds in these nanocrystals. Furthermore,\nsimulations show that Pb4Te4, among the aforementioned nanocrystals, has the\nlowest MEG threshold and the strongest absorptivity peak that is located in the\nmulti-excitation window, irrespective of the field strength, making it the most\nsuitable candidate for MEG applications. Simulations also demonstrate that an\nelectric field affects the MEG characteristics in the Pb4Te4 nanocrystal, in\ngeneral, less than it perturbs MEG characteristics in Pb4Se4 and Pb4S4\nnanocrystals. Our results can have a great impact in designing optoelectronic\ndevices whose performance can be significantly influenced by MEG.\n", "  In the frame of the Boltzmann equation, wall-bounded flows of rarefied gases\nrequire the implementation of boundary conditions at the kinetic level. Such\nboundary conditions induce a discontinuity in the distribution function with\nrespect to the component of the momentum which is normal to the boundary.\nExpanding the distribution function with respect to half-range polynomials\nallows this discontinuity to be captured. The implementation of this concept\nhas been reported in the literature only for force-free flows. In the case of\ngeneral forces which can have non-zero components in the direction\nperpendicular to the walls, the implementation of the force term requires\ntaking the momentum space gradient of a discontinuous function. Our proposed\nmethod deals with this difficulty by employing the theory of distributions. We\nvalidate our procedure by considering the simple one-dimensional flow between\ndiffuse-reflective walls of equal or different temperatures driven by the\nconstant gravitational force. For this flow, a comparison between the results\nobtained with the full-range and the half-range Gauss-Hermite LB models is also\npresented.\n", "  We present detailed observations of the shock waves emitted at the collapse\nof single cavitation bubbles using simultaneous time-resolved shadowgraphy and\nhydrophone pressure measurements. The geometry of the bubbles is systematically\nvaried from spherical to very non-spherical by decreasing their distance to a\nfree or rigid surface or by modulating the gravity-induced pressure gradient\naboard parabolic flights. The non-spherical collapse produces multiple shocks\nthat are clearly associated with different processes, such as the jet impact\nand the individual collapses of the distinct bubble segments. For bubbles\ncollapsing near a free surface, the energy and timing of each shock are\nmeasured separately as a function of the anisotropy parameter $\\zeta$, which\nrepresents the dimensionless equivalent of the Kelvin impulse. For a given\nsource of bubble deformation (free surface, rigid surface or gravity), the\nnormalized shock energy depends only on $\\zeta$, irrespective of the bubble\nradius $R_{0}$ and driving pressure $\\Delta p$. Based on this finding, we\ndevelop a predictive framework for the peak pressure and energy of shock waves\nfrom non-spherical bubble collapses. Combining statistical analysis of the\nexperimental data with theoretical derivations, we find that the shock peak\npressures can be estimated as jet impact-induced hammer pressures, expressed as\n$p_{h} = 0.45\\left(\\rho c^{2}\\Delta p\\right)^{1/2} \\zeta^{-1}$ at $\\zeta >\n10^{-3}$. The same approach is found to explain the shock energy quenching as a\nfunction of $\\zeta^{-2/3}$.\n", "  We prove a Feynman path integral formula for the unitary group $\n\\exp(-itL_{v,\\theta})$, $t\\geq 0$, associated with a discrete magnetic\nSchr\\\"odinger operator $L_{v,\\theta}$ on a large class of weighted infinite\ngraphs. As a consequence, we get a new Kato-Simon estimate $$\n|\\exp(-itL_{v,\\theta})(x,y)|\\leq \\exp(-tL_{-\\mathrm{deg},0})(x,y), $$ which\ncontrols the unitary group uniformly in the potentials in terms of a\nSchr\\\"odinger semigroup, where the potential $\\mathrm{deg}$ is the weighted\ndegree function of the graph.\n", "  We consider dynamics of a disordered ensemble of qubits interacting with\nsingle mode photon field, which is described by exactly solvable inhomogeneous\nDicke model. In particular, we concentrate on the crossover from few-qubit\nsystems to the system of many qubits and analyze how collective behavior of\ncoupled qubits-cavity system emerges despite of the broadening. We show that\nquantum interference effects survive in the mesoscopic regime -- dynamics of an\nentangled Bell state encoded into the qubit subsystem remains highly sensitive\nto the symmetry of the total wave function. Moreover, relaxation of these\nstates is slowed down due to the formation of collective dark states weakly\ncoupled to light. Dark states also significantly influence dynamics of\nexcitations of photon subsystem by absorbing them into the qubit subsystem and\nreleasing quasiperiodically in time. We argue that predicted phenomena can be\nuseful in quantum technologies based on superconducting qubits. For instance,\nthey provide tools to deeply probe both collective and quantum properties of\nsuch artificial macroscopic systems.\n", "  The ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition of multiferroic\nCaMnTi$_2$O$_6$ has been investigated at high pressures and ambient temperature\nby second harmonic generation (SHG), Raman spectroscopy, and powder and\nsingle-crystal x-ray diffraction. We have found that CaMnTi$_2$O$_6$ undergoes\na pressure-induced structural phase transition ($P4_2mc \\rightarrow P4_2/nmc$)\nat $\\sim$7 GPa to the same paraelectric structure found at ambient pressure and\n$T_c$ = 630 K. The continuous linear decrease of the SHG intensity that\ndisappears at 7 GPa and the existence of a Raman active mode at 244 cm$^{-1}$\nthat first softens up to 7 GPa and then hardens with pressure, are used to\ndiscuss the nature of the phase transition of CaMnTi$_2$O$_6$ for which a\nd$T_c$/d$P = -48$ K/GPa has been found. Neither a volume contraction nor a\nchange of the normalized pressure on the eulerian strain are observed across\nthe phase transition with all the unit-cell volume data following a second\norder Birch-Murnaghan equation of state with a bulk modulus of $B_0$ =\n182.95(2) GPa.\n", "  A polarizable environment, prominently the solvent, responds to electronic\nchanges in biomolecules rapidly. The knowledge of conformational relaxation of\nthe biomolecule itself, however, may be scarce or missing. In this work, we\ndescribe in detail the structural changes in DNA undergoing electron transfer\nbetween two adjacent nucleobases. We employ an approach based on averaging of\ntens to hundreds of thousands of nonequilibrium trajectories generated with\nmolecular dynamics simulation, and a reduction of dimensionality suitable for\nDNA. We show that the conformational response of the DNA proceeds along a\nsingle collective coordinate that represents the relative orientation of two\nconsecutive base pairs, namely, a combination of helical parameters shift and\ntilt. The structure of DNA relaxes on time scales reaching nanoseconds,\ncontributing marginally to the relaxation of energies, which is dominated by\nthe modes of motion of the aqueous solvent. The concept of reaction path\naveraging (RPA), conveniently exploited in this context, makes it possible to\nfilter out any undesirable noise from the nonequilibrium data, and is\napplicable to any chemical process in general.\n", "  A key unresolved question is the role that galaxy mergers play in driving\nstellar mass growth over cosmic time. Recent observational work hints at the\npossibility that the overall contribution of `major' mergers (mass ratios\n$\\gtrsim$1:4) to cosmic stellar mass growth may be small, because they enhance\nstar formation rates by relatively small amounts at high redshift, when much of\ntoday's stellar mass was assembled. However, the heterogeneity and relatively\nsmall size of today's datasets, coupled with the difficulty in identifying\ngenuine mergers, makes it challenging to $\\textit{empirically}$ quantify the\nmerger contribution to stellar mass growth. Here, we use Horizon-AGN, a\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulation, to comprehensively quantify the\ncontribution of mergers to the star formation budget over the lifetime of the\nUniverse. We show that: (1) both major and minor mergers enhance star formation\nto similar amounts, (2) the fraction of star formation directly attributable to\nmerging is small at all redshifts (e.g. $\\sim$35 and $\\sim$20 per cent at\nz$\\sim$3 and z$\\sim$1 respectively) and (3) only $\\sim$25 per cent of today's\nstellar mass is directly attributable to galaxy mergers over cosmic time. Our\nresults suggest that smooth accretion, not merging, is the dominant driver of\nstellar mass growth over the lifetime of the Universe.\n", "  The temperature effect of quantum interference on resistivity is examined in\nmonolayer graphene, with experimental results showing that the amplitude of the\nconductance fluctuation increases as temperature decreases. We find that this\nbehavior can be attributed to the decrease in the inelastic scattering\n(dephasing) rate, which enhances the weak localization (WL) correction to\nresistivity. Following a previous report that explained the relationship\nbetween the universal conductance fluctuation (UCF) and WL regarding the gate\nvoltage dependence (D. Terasawa, et al., Phys. Rev. B 95 125427 (2017)), we\npropose that the temperature dependence of the UCF in monolayer graphene can be\ninterpreted by the WL theory.\n", "  We investigate a plasmonic electro-optic modulator with an extinction ratio\nexceeding 1 dB/um by engineering the optical mode to be in-plane with the\ngraphene layer, and show how lowering the operating temperature enables steeper\nswitching. We show how cooling Graphene enables steeping thus improving dynamic\nenergy consumption. Further, we show that multi-layer Graphene integrated with\na plasmonic slot waveguide allows for in-plane electric field components, and\n3-dB device lengths as short as several hundred nanometers only. Compact\nmodulators approaching electronic length-scales pave a way for ultra-dense\nphotonic integrated circuits with smallest footprints\n", "  Possibilities emerging out of the dynamical evolutions of collapsing systems\nare addressed in this thesis through analytical investigations of the highly\nnon-linear Einstein Field Equations. Studies of exact solutions and their\nproperties, play a non-trivial role in general relativity, even in the current\ncontext. Finding non-trivial solutions to the Einstein field equations requires\nsome reduction of the problem, which usually is done by exploiting symmetries\nor other properties. Exact solutions of the Einsteins field equations\ndescribing an unhindered gravitational collapse are studied which generally\npredict an ultimate singular end-state. In the vicinity of such a spacetime\nsingularity, the energy densities, spacetime curvatures, and all other physical\nquantities blow up. Despite exhaustive attempts over decades, the famous\nconjecture that the formation of a singularity during stellar collapse\nnecessarily accompanies the formation of an event horizon, thereby covering the\ncentral singularity, still remains without a proof. Moreover, there are\nexamples of stellar collapse models with reasonable matter contribution in\nwhich an event horizon does not form at all, giving rise to a naked singularity\nfrom which both matter and radiation can fall in and come out. These examples\nsuggest that the so-called cosmic censorship conjecture may not be a general\nrule. Therefore one must embark upon analysis of realistic theoretical models\nof gravitational collapse and gradually generalizing previous efforts.\n", "  The existence of black holes and of spacetime singularities is a fundamental\nissue in science. Despite this, observations supporting their existence are\nscarce, and their interpretation unclear. We overview how strong a case for\nblack holes has been made in the last few decades, and how well observations\nadjust to this paradigm. Unsurprisingly, we conclude that observational proof\nfor black holes is impossible to come by. However, just like Popper's black\nswan, alternatives can be ruled out or confirmed to exist with a single\nobservation. These observations are within reach. In the next few years and\ndecades, we will enter the era of precision gravitational-wave physics with\nmore sensitive detectors. Just as accelerators require larger and larger\nenergies to probe smaller and smaller scales, more sensitive gravitational-wave\ndetectors will be probing regions closer and closer to the horizon, potentially\nreaching Planck scales and beyond. What may be there, lurking?\n", "  We present a low entry-level introduction to the Conformal Bootstrap. We\nreview and obtain several basic bounds using Linear Programming in machine\nprecision in Mathematica, making the results accessible even to the most\nuneducated computer user. The Extremal Functional Method and the method of\ndeterminants are also explored. Finally, we make an attempt at writing modular\ninvariance statements as crossing symmetry equations for twist operators and\nperform Modular Bootstrap using 4-pt correlators.\n", "  Many datasets describing contacts in a population suffer from incompleteness\ndue to population sampling and underreporting of contacts. Data-driven\nsimulations of spreading processes using such incomplete data lead to an\nunderestimation of the epidemic risk, and it is therefore important to devise\nmethods to correct this bias. We focus here on a non-uniform sampling of the\ncontacts between individuals, aimed at mimicking the results of diaries or\nsurveys, and consider as case studies two datasets collected in different\ncontexts. We show that using surrogate data built using a method developed in\nthe case of uniform population sampling yields an improvement with respect to\nthe use of the sampled data but is strongly limited by the underestimation of\nthe link density in the sampled network. We put forward a second method to\nbuild surrogate data that assumes knowledge of the density of links within one\nof the groups forming the population. We show that it gives very good results\nwhen the population is strongly structured, and discuss its limitations in the\ncase of a population with a weaker group structure. These limitations highlight\nthe interest of measurements using wearable sensors able to yield accurate\ninformation on the structure and durations of contacts.\n", "  The precision measurement of diffusion coefficient of solution is very\nimportant for the clear understanding of material transfer and interaction\nbetween the materials. But the high precision measurement of diffusion\ncoefficient is very difficult compared to that of the other physical\nquantities. In this paper, we have proposed a new method to determine the\ndiffusion coefficient by using the radial laser rays formed by cylindrical\nrefractive system (cylindrical glass rod) and CCD camera. The cylindrical glass\nrod is placed in front of laser device and then, the laser rays spread\nradially. The slant curve with normal distribution profile is observed by\nilluminating these rays to the diffusion layer boundary. This curve is recorded\non PC by CCD (charge coupled device) camera and the shape of this curve varies\nwith time. The variation of maximum value with time in the curve determines\ndiffusion coefficient. The measured diffusivity value is in good agreement with\nthe previous experimental result in the tendency.\n", "  We examine the extent of gerrymandering for the 2010 General Assembly\ndistrict map of Wisconsin. We find that there is substantial variability in the\nelection outcome depending on what maps are used. We also found robust evidence\nthat the district maps are highly gerrymandered and that this gerrymandering\nlikely altered the partisan make up of the Wisconsin General Assembly in some\nelections. Compared to the distribution of possible redistricting plans for the\nGeneral Assembly, Wisconsin's chosen plan is an outlier in that it yields\nresults that are highly skewed to the Republicans when the statewide proportion\nof Democratic votes comprises more than 50-52% of the overall vote (with the\nprecise threshold depending on the election considered). Wisconsin's plan acts\nto preserve the Republican majority by providing extra Republican seats even\nwhen the Democratic vote increases into the range when the balance of power\nwould shift for the vast majority of redistricting plans.\n", "  We develop a second order primal-dual method for optimization problems in\nwhich the objective function is given by the sum of a strongly convex twice\ndifferentiable term and a possibly nondifferentiable convex regularizer. After\nintroducing an auxiliary variable, we utilize the proximal operator of the\nnonsmooth regularizer to transform the associated augmented Lagrangian into a\nfunction that is once, but not twice, continuously differentiable. The saddle\npoint of this function corresponds to the solution of the original optimization\nproblem. We employ a generalization of the Hessian to define second order\nupdates on this function and prove global exponential stability of the\ncorresponding differential inclusion. Furthermore, we develop a globally\nconvergent customized algorithm that utilizes the primal-dual augmented\nLagrangian as a merit function. We show that the search direction can be\ncomputed efficiently and prove quadratic/superlinear asymptotic convergence. We\nuse the $\\ell_1$-regularized least squares problem and the problem of designing\na distributed controller for a spatially-invariant system to demonstrate the\nmerits and the effectiveness of our method.\n", "  The high efficiency of charge generation within organic photovoltaic blends\napparently contrasts with the strong \"classical\" attraction between newly\nformed electron-hole pairs. Several factors have been identified as possible\nfacilitators of charge dissociation, such as quantum mechanical coherence and\ndelocalization, structural and energetic disorder, built-in electric fields,\nnanoscale intermixing of the donor and acceptor components of the blends. Our\nmesoscale quantum-chemical model allows an unbiased assessment of their\nrelative importance, through excited-state calculations on systems containing\nthousands of donor and acceptor sites. The results on several model\nheterojunctions confirm that the classical model severely overestimates the\nbinding energy of the electron-hole pairs, produced by vertical excitation from\nthe electronic ground state. Using physically sensible parameters for the\nindividual materials, we find that the quantum mechanical energy difference\nbetween the lowest interfacial charge transfer states and the fully separated\nelectron and hole is of the order of the thermal energy.\n", "  We prove a completely new integral criterion for the existence and\ncompleteness of the wave operators $W_{\\pm}(-\\Delta_h,-\\Delta_g, I_{g,h})$\ncorresponding to the (unique self-adjoint realizations of) the Laplace-Beltrami\noperators $-\\Delta_j$, $j=1,2$, that are induced by two quasi-isometric\ncomplete Riemannian metrics $g$ and $h$ on an open manifold $M$. In particular,\nthis result provides a criterion for the absolutely continuous spectra of\n$-\\Delta_g$ and $-\\Delta_h$ to coincide. Our proof relies on estimates that are\nobtained using a probabilistic Bismut type formula for the gradient of a heat\nsemigroup. Unlike all previous results, our integral criterion only requires\nsome lower control on the Ricci curvatures and some upper control on the heat\nkernels, but no control at all on the injectivity radii. As a consequence, we\nobtain a stability result for the absolutely continuous spectrum under a Ricci\nflow.\n", "  We examine the possibility of travelling wave solutions within the nonlinear\nEuler-Heisenberg electrodynamics. Since this theory resembles in its form the\nelectrodynamics in matter, it is a priori not clear if there exist travelling\nwave solutions with a new dispersion relation for $\\omega(k)$ or if the\nEuler-Heisenberg theory stringently imposes $\\omega=k$ for any arbitrary ansatz\n$\\mathbf{E}(\\xi)$ and $\\mathbf{B}(\\xi)$ with $\\xi \\equiv\n\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r} -\\omega t$. We show that the latter scheme applies\nfor the Euler-Heisenberg theory, but point out the possibility of new solutions\nwith $\\omega \\neq k$ if we go beyond the Euler-Heisenberg theory, allowing\nstrong fields. In case of the Euler-Heisenberg theory the quantum mechanical\neffect of the travelling wave solutions remains in $\\hbar$ corrections to the\nenergy density and the Poynting vector.\n", "  Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing is becoming an alternate computing\nplatform for numerical simulations. However, it is not clear which numerical\nscheme will provide the highest computational efficiency for different types of\nproblems. To this end, numerical accuracies and computational work of several\nnumerical methods are compared using a GPU computing implementation. The\nCorrection Procedure via Reconstruction (CPR), Discontinuous Galerkin (DG),\nNodal Discontinuous Galerkin (NDG), Spectral Difference (SD), and Finite Volume\n(FV) methods are investigated using various reconstruction orders. Both smooth\nand discontinuous cases are considered for two-dimensional simulations. For\ndiscontinuous problems, MUSCL schemes are employed with FV, while CPR, DG, NDG,\nand SD use slope limiting. The computation time to reach a set error criteria\nand total time to complete solutions are compared across the methods. It is\nshown that while FV methods can produce solutions with low computational times,\nthey produce larger errors than high-order methods for smooth problems at the\nsame order of accuracy. For discontinuous problems, the methods show good\nagreement with one another in terms of solution profiles, and the total\ncomputational times between FV, CPR, and SD are comparable.\n", "  There are several types of Galactic sources that can potentially accelerate\ncharged particles up to GeV and TeV energies. We present here the results of\nour observations of the source class of gamma-ray binaries and the subclass of\nbinary systems known as novae with the MAGIC telescopes. Up to now novae were\nonly detected in the GeV range. This emission can be interpreted in terms of an\ninverse Compton process of electrons accelerated in a shock. In this case it is\nexpected that protons in the same conditions can be accelerated to much higher\nenergies. Consequently they may produce a second component in the gamma-ray\nspectrum at TeV energies.\n  The focus here lies on the four sources: nova V339 Del, SS433, LS I +61 303\nand V404 Cygni. The binary system LS I +61 303 was observed in a long-term\nmonitoring campaign for 8 years. We show the newest results on our search for\nsuperorbital variability, also in context with contemporaneous optical\nobservations. Furthermore, we present the observations of the only\nsuper-critical accretion system known in our galaxy: SS433. Finally, the\nresults of the follow-up observations of the microquasar V404 Cygni during a\nseries of outbursts in the X-ray band and the ones of the nova V339 Del will be\ndiscussed in these proceedings.\n", "  In the presence of a magnetic field and weakly ionizing winds, ohmic\ndissipation is expected to take place in the envelopes of Jovian and lower-mass\nplanets alike. While the process has been investigated on the former, there\nhave been no studies done on mini-Neptunes so far. From structure and thermal\nevolution models, we determine that the required energy deposition for halting\nthe contraction of mini-Neptunes increases with planetary mass and envelope\nfraction. Scaled to the insolation power, the ohmic heating needed is small\n$\\sim10^{-5}$ -- orders of magnitude lower than for exo-Jupiters $\\sim\n10^{-2}$. Conversely, from solving the magnetic induction equation, we find\nthat ohmic energy is dissipated more readily for lower-mass planets and those\nwith larger envelope fractions. Combining these two trends, we find that ohmic\ndissipation in hot mini-Neptunes is strong enough to inflate their radii ($\\sim\n10^{15}$ W for $T_{eq}=1400K$). The implication is that the radii of hot\nmini-Neptunes may be attributed in part to ohmic heating. Thus, there is a\ntrade-off between ohmic dissipation and H/He content for hot mini-Neptunes,\nadding a new degeneracy for the interpretation of the composition of such\nplanets. In addition, ohmic dissipation would make mini-Neptunes more\nvulnerable to atmospheric evaporation.\n", "  Based on optical high-resolution spectra obtained with CFHT/ESPaDOnS, we\npresent new measurements of activity and magnetic field proxies of 442 low-mass\nK5-M7 dwarfs. The objects were analysed as potential targets to search for\nplanetary-mass companions with the new spectropolarimeter and high-precision\nvelocimeter, SPIRou. We have analysed their high-resolution spectra in an\nhomogeneous way: circular polarisation, chromospheric features, and Zeeman\nbroadening of the FeH infrared line. The complex relationship between these\nactivity indicators is analysed: while no strong connection is found between\nthe large-scale and small-scale magnetic fields, the latter relates with the\nnon-thermal flux originating in the chromosphere.\n  We then examine the relationship between various activity diagnostics and the\noptical radial-velocity jitter available in the literature, especially for\nplanet host stars. We use this to derive for all stars an activity merit\nfunction (higher for quieter stars) with the goal of identifying the most\nfavorable stars where the radial-velocity jitter is low enough for planet\nsearches. We find that the main contributors to the RV jitter are the\nlarge-scale magnetic field and the chromospheric non-thermal emission.\n  In addition, three stars (GJ 1289, GJ 793, and GJ 251) have been followed\nalong their rotation using the spectropolarimetric mode, and we derive their\nmagnetic topology. These very slow rotators are good representatives of future\nSPIRou targets. They are compared to other stars where the magnetic topology is\nalso known. The poloidal component of the magnetic field is predominent in all\nthree stars.\n", "  We discuss the estimation of the interferometric visibility (fringe contrast)\nfor the exozodi survey conducted at the CHARA array with the JouFLU beam\ncombiner. We investigate the use of the statistical median to estimate the\nuncalibrated visibility from an ensemble of fringe exposures. Under a broad\nrange of operating conditions, numerical simulations indicate that this\nestimator has a smaller bias compared to other estimators. We also propose an\nimproved method for calibrating visibilities, which not only takes into account\nthe time-interval between observations of calibrators and science targets, but\nalso the uncertainties of the calibrators' raw visibilities. We test our\nmethods with data corresponding to stars that do not display the exozodi\nphenomenon. The results of our tests show that the proposed method yields\nsmaller biases and errors. The relative reduction in bias and error is\ngenerally modest, but can be as high as $\\sim 20-40\\%$ for the brightest stars\nof the CHARA data, and statistically significant at the $95\\%$ confidence level\n(CL).\n", "  Petawatt class femtosecond lasers and x-ray free electron lasers (XFEL) open\nup a new page in research fields related to space and vacuum physics. One of\nfundamental principles can be explored by these new instruments is the\nequivalence principle, saying that gravitation and acceleration should be\ntreated equivalently. If it is true this must lead to the appearance of the\nUnruh effect analogous to Hawking's black hole radiation. It says that a\ndetector moving with a constant acceleration $w$ sees a boson's thermal bath\nwith its temperature $T_w=\\hbar w/2\\pi k_B c$. Practical detection of the Unruh\neffect requires extremely strong acceleration and fast probing sources. Here we\ndemonstrate that x-rays scattering from highly accelerated electrons can be\nused for such detection. We present two, feasible for the Unruh effect, designs\nfor highly accelerated systems produced in underdense plasma irradiated by high\nintensity lasers pulses. The first is Thomson scattering of a XFEL pulse from\nplasma wave excited by an intense laser pulse. Properly chosen observation\nangles enable us to distinguish the Unruh effect from the normal Doppler shift\nwith a reasonable photon number. The second is a system consisting of electron\nbunches accelerated by a laser wake-field, as sources and as detectors, which\nmove in a constantly accelerating reference frame (Rindler space) and are\nprobed by x-ray free electron laser pulses. The numbers of photons is shown to\nbe enough to observe reproducible results.\n", "  Descriptors, which are representations of compounds, play an essential role\nin machine learning of materials data. Although many representations of\nelements and structures of compounds are known, these representations are\ndifficult to use as descriptors in their unchanged forms. This chapter shows\nhow compounds in a dataset can be represented as descriptors and applied to\nmachine-learning models for materials datasets.\n", "  Analytical and numerical galaxy-formation models indicate that active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) likely play a prominent role in the formation and\nevolution of galaxies. However, quantifying this effect requires knowledge of\nhow the nuclear activity proceeds throughout the life of a galaxy, whether it\nalternates with periods of quiescence and, if so, on what timescales these\ncycles occur. This topic has attracted growing interest, but making progress\nremains a challenging task. For optical and radio AGNs, a variety of techniques\nare used to perform a kind of \"archaeology\" that traces the signatures of past\nnuclear activity. Here we summarize recent findings regarding the lifecycle of\nan AGN from optical and radio observations. The limited picture we have so far\nsuggests that these cycles can range from long periods of 10^7-10^8 yr to\nshorter periods of 10^4-10^5 yr, even reaching extreme events on timescales of\njust a few years. Together with simulations, observational results regarding\nthe multiple cycles of AGN activity help to create a complete picture of the\nAGN lifecycle.\n", "  The following scenarios of Re-embedding into SiO2-host by pulsed\nRe-implantation were derived and discussed after XPS-and-DFT electronic\nstructure qualification: (i) low Re-impurity concentration mode -> the\nformation of combined substitutional and interstitial impurities with\nRe2O7-like atomic and electronic structures in the vicinity of oxygen\nvacancies; (ii) high Re-impurity concentration mode -> the fabrication of\ninterstitial Re-metal clusters with the accompanied formation of ReO2-like\natomic structures and (iii) an intermediate transient mode with Re-impurity\nconcentration increase, when the precursors of interstitial defect clusters are\nappeared and growing in the host-matrix structure occur. An amplification\nregime of Re-metal contribution majority to the final Valence Band structure\nwas found as one of the sequences of intermediate transient mode. It was shown\nthat most of the qualified and discussed modes were accompanied by the MRO\n(middle range ordering) distortions in the initial oxygen subnetwork of the\na-SiO2 host-matrix because of the appeared mixed defect configurations.\n", "  Higher-order accurate solution to electromagnetic scattering problems are\nobtained at reduced computational cost in a {\\it p}-variable finite volume time\ndomain method. Spatial operators of lower, including first-order accuracy, are\nemployed locally in substantial parts of the computational domain during the\nsolution process. The use of computationally cheaper lower order spatial\noperators does not affect the overall higher-order accuracy of the solution.\nThe order of the spatial operator at a candidate cell during numerical\nsimulation can vary in space and time and is dynamically chosen based on an\norder of magnitude comparison of scattered and incident fields at the cell\ncenter. Numerical results are presented for electromagnetic scattering from\nperfectly conducting two-dimensional scatterers subject to transverse magnetic\nand transverse electric illumination.\n", "  Metallic glasses have so far attracted considerable attention for their\napplications as bulk materials. However, new physics and applications often\nemerge by dimensional reduction from three dimension (3D) to two dimension\n(2D). Here, we study, by molecular dynamics simulations, how the\nliquid-to-glass transition of a binary Cu50Zr50 MG is affected by spatial\ndimensionality. We find clear evidence that crystal-like structural ordering\ncontrols both dynamic heterogeneity and slow dynamics, and thus plays a crucial\nrole in the formation of the 2DMG. Although the 2DMG reproduces the dynamical\nbehaviors of its 3D counterpart by considering Mermin-Wagner-type fluctuations\nspecific to 2D, this atomic-scale structural mechanism is essentially different\nfrom that for the 3DMG in which icosahedral clusters incompatible with\ncrystallographic symmetry play a key role in glassy behaviors. Our finding\nprovides a new structural mechanism for the formation of 2DMGs, which cannot be\ninferred from the knowledge of 3DMGs. The results suggest a structural basis\nfor the glass transition in 2DMG and provide possible explanations for some\nprevious experimental observations in ultrathin film MGs.\n", "  Thermal fluctuations play an increasingly important role in micromagnetic\nresearch relevant for various biomedical and other technological applications.\nUntil now, it was deemed necessary to use a time stepping algorithm with a\nfixed time step in order to perform micromagnetic simulations at nonzero\ntemperatures. However, Berkov and Gorn have shown that the drift term which\ngenerally appears when solving stochastic differential equations can only\ninfluence the length of the magnetization. This quantity is however fixed in\nthe case of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In this paper, we\nexploit this fact to straightforwardly extend existing high order solvers with\nan adaptive time stepping algorithm. We implemented the presented methods in\nthe freely available GPU-accelerated micromagnetic software package MuMax3 and\nused it to extensively validate the presented methods. Next to the advantage of\nhaving control over the error tolerance, we report a twenty fold speedup\nwithout a loss of accuracy, when using the presented methods as compared to the\nhereto best practice of using Heun's solver with a small fixed time step.\n", "  We prove that if two non-trapping obstacles in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy some\nrather weak non-degeneracy conditions and the scattering rays in their\nexteriors have (almost) the same travelling times or (almost) the same\nscattering length spectrum, then they coincide.\n", "  We study pressure-driven propagation of gas into a micron-scale gap between\ntwo linearly elastic substrates. Applying the lubrication approximation, the\nflow-field is governed by the interaction between elasticity and viscosity, as\nwell as weak rarefaction and low-Mach-compressibility, characteristic to\ngaseous microflows. Several physical limits allow simplification of the\ngoverning evolution equation and enable solution by self-similarity. These\nlimits correspond to different time-scales and physical regimes which include\ncompressiblity-elasticity-viscosity, compressiblity-viscosity and\nelasticity-viscosity dominant balances. For a prewetting layer thickness which\nis similar to the elastic deformation generated by the background pressure, a\nsymmetry between compressibility and elasticity allows to obtain a self-similar\nsolution which includes weak rarefaction effects. The results are validated by\nnumerical solutions of the evolution equation\n", "  Laser Induced Incandescence (LII) is an experimental technique that has been\nextensively used for in-flame measurement of soot properties. The traditional\nlaser used for LII has been Nd:YAG laser with 5-10 ns pulse durations. The\npresent study investigates an unexpected LII signal behaviour in the form of a\nsecondary peak observed when using long laser pulse duration in the range of\nhundreds of ns. Temporal LII signals at varying fluences (up to 4.5 J/cm2) and\npulse durations are presented and discussed. Although an explanation based on\ntheoretical grounds has not been found, the study shows that the phenomenon is\nindependent of pulse duration and that its appearance correlates with laser\nfluences of approximately 1.1 J/cm2. Artificial signal generated by the\nexperimental procedures cannot be excluded, but if so could not be identified.\nOne suggestion is an amplified effect of the phenomenon observed in the\nliterature where new particles were created from the molecular cloud during\nhigh laser fluence LII. Since LII using long pulse durations are not widely\nused, but present a true potential in relation to sensor technology, this\nunexpected LII behaviour, either physically linked to the laser-soot\ninteraction or induced by experimental flaw, should be further watched and\nunderstood.\n", "  Theoretical framework for the isosteric heat of adsorption is developed\ntreating the effects of the non-ideal gas behavior and the adsorbed phase\nvolume. Rigorous thermodynamic treatment for the adsorbed phase volume is\npresented for multi-layer adsorption from low to high pressures. The proposed\nmodel for the isosteric heat of adsorption along with the adsorbed phase volume\nis validated and verified using experimental data for several, judiciously\nselected adsorbent + adsorbate (nonpolar molecules) systems. The predictions by\nthe model exhibit excellent agreement with the experimental data for both\nadsorption isotherms and the isosteric heat of adsorption.\n", "  To explore the magnetic flux dispersion in the undisturbed solar photosphere,\nmagnetograms acquired by Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the\nSolar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) were utilized. Two areas, a coronal hole area\n(CH) and an area of super-granulation pattern, SG, were analyzed. We explored\nthe displacement and separation spectra and the behavior of the turbulent\ndiffusion coefficient, $K$. The displacement and separation spectra are very\nsimilar to each other. Small magnetic elements (of size 3-100 squared pixels\nand the detection threshold of 20 Mx sm$^{-2}$) in both CH and SG areas\ndisperse in the same way and they are more mobile than the large elements (of\nsize 20-400 squared pixels and the detection threshold of 130 Mx sm$^{-2}$).\nThe regime of super-diffusivity is found for small elements ($\\gamma \\approx\n1.3 $ and $K$ growing from $\\sim$100 to $\\sim$ 300 km$^2$ s$^{-1}$). Large\nelements in the CH area are scanty and show super-diffusion with $\\gamma\n\\approx 1.2$ and $K$ = (62-96) km$^2$ s$^{-1}$ on rather narrow range of\n500-2200 km. Large elements in the SG area demonstrate two ranges of linearity\nand two diffusivity regimes: sub-diffusivity on scales (900-2500) km with\n$\\gamma=0.88$ and $K$ decreasing from $\\sim$130 to $\\sim$100 km$^2$ s$^{-1}$,\nand super-diffusivity on scales (2500-4800) km with $\\gamma \\approx 1.3$ and\n$K$ growing from $\\sim$140 to $\\sim$200 km$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Comparison of our\nresults with the previously published shows that there is a tendency of\nsaturation of the diffusion coefficient on large scales, i.e., the turbulent\nregime of super-diffusivity is gradually replaced by normal diffusion.\n", "  In this paper we propose a deterministic mathematical model that attempts to\nexplain the propagation of a rumor using SIRS type epidemiological models with\ntemporary immunity and nonlinear incidence rate. In particular, we speculate\nabout the dissemination of information when the so-called \"complex networks\"\nare used. The effect of introducing a second rumor, inspired by a vaccination\nmodel, in the same population of individuals, which will try to counteract the\neffect of the original rumor, is studied. That is a situation that occurs\nfrequently in communities, when a rumor is counteracted by a contrary\ninformation or news, which behaves in the same way as a rumor. Furthermore,\nqualitative analysis and numerical experimentation of the dynamic model are\nperformed. We corroborate that the dynamics of spreading rumors show similar\nbehavior to that found in the dynamics of an infectious disease.\n", "  Predictions of the solar wind at Earth are a central aspect of space weather\nprediction. The outcome of such a prediction, however, is highly sensitive to\nthe method used for computing the magnetic field in the corona. We analyze the\nimpact of replacing the potential field coronal boundary conditions, as used in\noperational space weather prediction tools, by non-potential conditions. For\nthis, we compare the predicted solar wind plasma parameters with observations\nat 1 AU for two six-months intervals, one at solar maximum and one in the\ndescending phase of the current cycle. As a baseline, we compare with the\noperational Wang-Sheeley-Arge model. We find that for solar maximum, the\nnon-potential coronal model and an adapted solar wind speed formula lead to the\nbest solar wind predictions in a statistical sense. For the descending phase,\nthe potential coronal model performs best. The Wang-Sheeley-Arge model\noutperforms the others in predicting high speed enhancements and streamer\ninteractions. A better parameter fitting for the adapted wind speed formula is\nexpected to improve the performance of the non-potential model here.\n", "  The resuspension and dispersion of particles occur in industrial fluid\ndynamic processes as well as environmental and geophysical situations. In this\npaper, we experimentally investigate the ability to fluidize a granular bed\nwith a vertical gradient of temperature. Using laboratory experiments with a\nlocalized heat source, we observe a large entrainment of particles into the\nfluid volume beyond a threshold temperature. The buoyancy-driven fluidized bed\nthen leads to the transport of solid particles through the generation of\nparticle-laden plumes. We show that the destabilization process is driven by\nthe thermal conductivity inside the granular bed and demonstrate that the\nthreshold temperature depends on the thickness of the granular bed and the\nbuoyancy number, i.e., the ratio of the stabilizing density contrast to the\ndestabilizing thermal density contrast.\n", "  I review progress towards understanding the time-scales of star and cluster\nformation and of the absolute ages of young stars. I focus in particular on the\nareas in which Francesco Palla made highly significant contributions -\ninterpretation of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams of young clusters and the\nrole of photospheric lithium as an age diagnostic.\n", "  Dechlorinated fragmental ions of organochlorines can be commonly found on\nelectron ionization-mass spectrometry (EI-MS). Yet it is still unclear whether\nmultiple dechlorination reactions taking place in EI-MS are concerted or\nstepwise. This study investigated the concertedness of the multiple\ndechlorination reactions of perchlorethylene (PCE) in EI-MS in light of the\nobserved chlorine isotope effects during different dechlorination reactions\nalong with the detected MS signal intensities. The fluctuant isotope ratios\namong different ions revealed that the observed multiple dechlorinated\nreactions in the EI-DFS-HRMS were stepwise. And the changing trends of isotope\nratios of the ions detected by EI-qMS might suggest that the observed multiple\ndechlorination reactions in this MS were concerted. Mechanisms for these\nconcerted/stepwise multiple dechlorination reactions are tentatively\ninterpreted. Besides the evidence of isotope effects, according to the\nquasi-equilibrium theory, the MS signal intensities also suggested that the\nmultiple dechlorination reactions in the EI-HRMS were likely stepwise, while\nthose in the EI-qMS might be concerted. The distance from the ionization region\nto the mass analyzer entrance in an MS may be a critical factor affecting the\ndechlorination reactions of ions flying over this distance. This distance in\nthe EI-qMS is significantly shorter than that in the EI-HRMS. Thus, the main\ndetected ions in the EI-qMS might be generated during the ionization and\nin-source fragmentation processes, while the main ions detected in the EI-HRMS\nmight be produced during the fragmentation of precursor ions flying over the\ndistance. We deduce that the main dechlorination reactions in the ionization\nregion were concerted, while those taking place during the flight of precursor\nions over the distance from the ionization region to the mass analyzer entrance\nwere stepwise.\n", "  We use the x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, isothermal\nmagnetization, and photoelectron spectroscopy to study the structural, magnetic\nand electronic properties of La$_{(1-x)}$$A_x$CoO$_3$ ($A=$ Sr, Ca; $x=$ 0 --\n0.2) nanoparticles. The Rietveld refinements of room temperature powder x-ray\ndiffraction data confirm the single phase and the rhombohedral crystal\nstructure with R$\\bar{3}$C space group. We find drastic changes in the magnetic\nproperties and spin-states with Sr/Ca substitution (hole doping). For $x=$ 0\nsample, the magnetic measurements show a ferromagnetic transition at T$_{\\rm\nC}$$\\approx$85 K, which shifted significantly to higher temperatures with hole\ndoping; simultaneously a significant increase in the spontaneous magnetic\nmoment has been observed. Whereas, the coercive field H$_{\\rm C}$ values are 7,\n4.4 and 13.2~kOe for $x=$ 0, 0.2 (Sr), and 0.2(Ca) samples. Furthermore, the FC\nmagnetization shows a ferromagnetic Brillouin function like behavior at low\ntemperatures for Ca samples. We demonstrate that the Sr/Ca substitution\nincreases the population of IS (Co$^{3+}$) and LS (Co$^{4+}$) states and tune\nthe ferromagnetism in nanoparticles via double-exchange interactions between\nCo$^{3+}$-- Co$^{4+}$. Our results suggest an important role of hole carriers\nand nano-size effect in controlling the spin-state and magnetism in\nLa$_{(1-x)}$$A_x$CoO$_3$ nanoparticles.\n", "  Theory of the influence of the thermal fluctuations on the electric transport\nbeyond linear response in superconductors is developed within the framework of\nthe time dependent Ginzburg - Landau approach. The I - V curve is calculated\nusing the dynamical self - consistent gaussian approximation. Under certain\nconditions it exhibits a reentrant behaviour acquiring an S - shape form. The\nunstable region below a critical temperature $T^{\\ast }$ is determined for\narbitrary dimensionality ($D=1,2,3$) of the thermal fluctuations. The results\nare applied to analyse the transport data on nanowires and several classes of\n2D superconductors: metallic thin films, layered and atomically thick novel\nmaterials.\n", "  Density functional theory (DFT) and many body perturbation theory at the\nG$_0$W$_0$ level are employed to study the electronic properties of\npolythiophene (PT) adsorbed on graphene surface. Analysis of charge density\ndifference shows the substrate-adsorbate interaction leading to a strong\nphysisorption and interfacial electric dipole moment formation. The\nelectrostatic potential displays a -0.19 eV shift in the graphene work function\nfrom its initial value of 4.53 eV, as the result of the interaction. The LDA\nband gap of the polymer does not show any change, however the energy level\nlineshapes are modified by the orbital hybridization. The interfacial\npolarization effects on the band gap and levels alignment are investigated\nwithin G$_0$W$_0$ level and shows notable reduction of PT band gap compared to\nthat of the isolated chain.\n", "  Optical and electronic properties of black phosphorus strongly depend on the\nnumber of layers and type of stacking. Using first-principles calculations\nwithin the framework of density functional theory, we investigate the\nelectronic properties of bilayer black phosphorus with an interlayer twist\nangle of 90$^\\circ$. These calculations are complemented with a simple\n$\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{p}$ model which is able to capture most of the low energy\nfeatures and is valid for arbitrary twist angles. The electronic spectrum of\n90$^\\circ$ twisted bilayer black phosphorus is found to be x-y isotropic in\ncontrast to the monolayer. However x-y anisotropy, and a partial return to\nmonolayer-like behavior, particularly in the valence band, can be induced by an\nexternal out-of-plane electric field. Moreover, the preferred hole effective\nmass can be rotated by 90$^\\circ$ simply by changing the direction of the\napplied electric field. In particular, a +0.4 (-0.4) V/{\\AA} out-of-plane\nelectric field results in a $\\sim$60\\% increase in the hole effective mass\nalong the y (x) axis and enhances the $m^*_{y}/m^*_{x}$ ($m^*_{x}/m^*_{y}$)\nratio as much as by a factor of 40. Our DFT and $\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{p}$\nsimulations clearly indicate that the twist angle in combination with an\nappropriate gate voltage is a novel way to tune the electronic and optical\nproperties of bilayer phosphorus and it gives us a new degree of freedom to\nengineer the properties of black phosphorus based devices.\n", "  Prediction of two-phase boiling flows using the computational fluid dynamics\n(CFD) approach is very challenging since several sub-models for interfacial\nmass, momentum and energy transfer in such flows are still not well established\nand require further development and validation. Once validating a particular\nmodel, it is important that all key parameter involved in the model are\ncarefully verified. Such verification is typically performed by separate effect\ntests, where one parameter at a time is compared to a measured or otherwise\nknown value. Needless to say that for complex models, which are typical for CFD\napplications to two-phase flow, the number of independent parameters that need\nto be verified can be quite high. This particular feature makes the validation\nprocess of complex CFD models in open source codes very attractive, since full\naccess to the implementation details is possible.\n  This paper is concerned with implementation and validation of two-phase\nboiling bubbly flow models using the OpenFOAM, open source environment. The\nmodel employs the two-fluid formulation of the conservation equations with the\nReynolds-averaged treatment of the turbulent terms. The model consists of six\nconservation equations for the liquid and the vapor phase, allowing for the\nthermodynamic non-equilibrium and compressibility of both phases. In addition,\nthe model includes two transport equations for the turbulence kinetic energy\nand energy dissipation and one transport equation for the interfacial area\nconcentration. New models for wall heat partitioning as well as for the phase\nchange terms in nucleate boiling have been implemented. Sensitivity studies as\nwell as validation of the model against measured data available in the open\nliterature have been performed and it has been shown that a reasonable\nagreement between predictions and experiments has been achieved.\n", "  Magnetoelectric multiferroic materials, particularly with the perovskite\nstructure, are receiving a lot of attention because of their inherent coupling\nbetween electrical polarization and magnetic ordering. However, very few types\nof direct coupling between polarization and magnetization are known, and it is\nunclear whether they can be useful to the design of novel spintronic devices\nexploiting the control of magnetization by electric fields. For instance, the\ntypical bi-quadratic coupling only allows to change the magnitude of the\nmagnetization by an electric field, but it does not permit an\nelectric-field-induced switching of the magnetization. Similarly, the so-called\nLifshitz invariants allow an electric-field control of complicated magnetic\norderings, but not of the magnetization. Here, we report the discovery of novel\ndirect couplings between polarization and magnetization in epitaxial perovskite\nfilms, via the use of first-principles methods and the development of an\noriginal Landau-type phenomenological theory. Our results feature penta-linear\ninteractions involving the ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic vectors as well\nas the polar distortions and oxygen octahedral tilting, and permit a number of\nstriking effects. Examples include a continuous electric-field control of the\nmagnetization magnitude and sign, and the discrete switching of the\nmagnetization magnitude. Thus, the high-order, penta-linear couplings\ndemonstrated in this work may open new paths towards novel magneto-electric\neffects, as well as, spintronic and magnonic devices.\n", "  The Melan equation for suspension bridges is derived by assuming small\ndisplacements of the deck and inextensible hangers. We determine the thresholds\nfor the validity of the Melan equation when the hangers slacken, thereby\nviolating the inextensibility assumption. To this end, we preliminarily study\nthe possible shortening of the cables: it turns out that there is a striking\ndifference between even and odd vibrating modes since the former never shorten\nthe cables. These problems are studied both on beams and plates.\n", "  Ferromagnetic-ferroelectric composites have attracted interests in recent\nyears for use as magnetic field sensors. The sensing is based on\nmagneto-electric (ME) coupling between the electric and magnetic subsystems and\nis mediated by mechanical strain. Such sensors for AC magnetic fields require a\nbias magnetic field to achieve pT-sensitivity. Here we discuss measurements and\ntheory for a novel passive, AC magnetic sensor that does not require a bias\nmagnetic field and is based on a PZT bimorph with a permanent magnet proof\nmass. Mechanical strain on the PZT bimorph in this case is produced by\ninteraction between the applied AC magnetic field and remnant magnetization of\nthe permanent magnet, resulting in an induced voltage across PZT. Our studies\nhave been performed on sensors with a bimorph of oppositely poled PZT platelets\nand a NdFeB permanent magnet proof mass. Magnetic floor noise N on the order of\n100 pT per sqrHz and 10 nT per sqrHz are measured at 1 Hz and 10 Hz,\nrespectively. When the AC magnetic field is applied at the bending resonance of\n40 Hz for the bimorph, the measured N 700 pT per sqrHz. We also discuss a\ntheory for the magneto-electro-mechanical coupling at low frequency and bending\nresonance in the sensor and theoretical estimates of ME voltage coefficients\nare in very good agreement with the data.\n", "  The composites of strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSMO) with zinc oxide\n(ZnO) are candidate materials for energy harvesting by virtue of their magnetic\nand piezoelectric characteristics. They could be used to harvest energy from\nstray sources, such as the vibrations and electromagnetic noise from\ntransformers and compressors within electrical grid power stations to power\nsmall diagnostic sensors, among other applications. The LSMO/ZnO nanocomposites\nwere made by: (i) milling the two bulk powders and, (ii) a wet chemical process\nwhich resulted in core-shell structures. The electrical, piezoelectric, and\nmagnetoelectric properties showed strong dependence on the fabrication method.\nGrowth of ZnO nanopillars on the particulate core of LSMO surface appears to\nhave improved the piezoelectric properties. Moreover, the chemical bath\ndeposition process can be easily modified to incorporate dopants to augment\nthese properties further.\n", "  Here, we propose novel transparency effect in cylindrical all-dielectric\nmetamaterials. We show that cancellation of multipole moments of the same kind\nlead to almost zero radiation losses due to the counter-directed multipolar\nmoments in metamolecule. . Nullifying of multipoles, mainly dipoles and\nsuppression of higher multipoles results in ideal transmission of incident wave\nthrough the designed metamaterial. The observed effect could pave the road to\nnew generation of light-manipulating transparent metadevices such as filters,\nwaveguides, cloaks and more.\n", "  A water soluble amorphous form of silk was made by ultra-short laser pulse\nirradiation and detected by nanoscale IR mapping. An optical absorption-induced\nnanoscale surface expansion was probed to yield the spectral response of silk\nat IR molecular fingerprinting wavelengths with a high ~20 nm spatial\nresolution defined by the tip of the probe. Silk microtomed sections of 1-5\nmicrometers in thickness were prepared for nanoscale spectroscopy and a laser\nwas used to induce amorphisation. Comparison of silk absorbance measurements\ncarried out by table-top and synchrotron Fourier transform IR spectroscopy\nproved that chemical imaging obtained at high spatial resolution and\nspecificity (able to discriminate between amorphous and crystalline silk) is\nreliably achieved by nanoscale IR. A nanoscale material characterization using\nsynchrotron IR radiation is discussed.\n", "  Spin transport in electric conductors is largely determined by two material\nparameters - spin diffusion length and spin Hall angle. In metals, these are\ntypically determined indirectly by probing magnetoresistance in magnet/metal\nheterostructures, assuming knowledge of the interfacial properties. We suggest\nprofiling the charge current induced spin Hall spin accumulation in metals, via\ndetection of the magnetic stray field generated by the associated static\nmagnetization, as a direct means of determining spin transport parameters. We\nevaluate the spatial profile of the stray field as well as the Oersted field\ngenerated by the charge current. We thus demonstrate that such a charge current\ninduced spin accumulation is well within the detection limit of contemporary\ntechnology. Measuring the stray fields may enable direct access to spin-related\nproperties of metals paving the way for a better and consistent understanding\nof spin transport therein.\n", "  TTFClO4 salts were included in a PMMA matrix via solvent casting technique\nunder vacuum, up to 72 hours of pumping. The synthesis of the salt, present in\nthe literature was enriched with a further purification procedure, wich\nresulted important to obtain TTF+. radical cation aggregates. The thin films\nwere characterized by low temperature UV-VIS-NIR absorption, and a\nmulticomponent broad charge transfer band (CT) in the near infrared was found.\nRaman spectroscopy (RRS) in resonance with the CT transition allowed to study\nthe origin of the CT absorption: the species present in the films were\nrecognized as dimers and aggregates of TTF+. radical cation.\n", "  We perform 1D/2D/3D relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of accretion\nflows with low angular momentum, filling the gap between spherically symmetric\nBondi accretion and disc-like accretion flows. Scenarios with different\ndirectional distributions of angular momentum of falling matter and varying\nvalues of key parameters such as spin of central black hole, energy and angular\nmomentum of matter are considered. In some of the scenarios the shock front is\nformed. We identify ranges of parameters for which the shock after formation\nmoves towards or outwards the central black hole or the long lasting\noscillating shock is observed. The frequencies of oscillations of shock\npositions which can cause flaring in mass accretion rate are extracted. The\nresults are scalable with mass of central black hole and can be compared to the\nquasi-periodic oscillations of selected microquasars (such as GRS 1915+105, XTE\nJ1550-564 or IGR J17091-3624), as well as to the supermassive black holes in\nthe centres of weakly active galaxies, such as Sgr $A^{*}$.\n", "  We study the motion of a substance in a channel of a network that consists of\nchain of nodes of a network (the nodes can be considered as boxes) and edges\nthat connect the nodes and form the way for motion of the substance. The nodes\nof the channel can have different \"leakage\", i.e., some amount of the substance\ncan leave the channel at a node and the rate of leaving may be different for\nthe different nodes of the channel. In addition the nodes close to the end of\nthe channel for some (construction or other) reason may be more \"attractive\"\nfor the substance in comparison to the nodes around the entry node of the\nchannel. We discuss channels containing infinite or finite number of nodes and\nobtain the distribution of the substance along the nodes. Two regimes of\nfunctioning of the channels are studied: stationary regime and non-stationary\nregime. The distribution of the substance along the nodes of the channel for\nthe case of stationary regime is a generalization of the Waring distribution\n(for channel with infinite number of nodes) or generalization of the truncated\nWaring distribution (for channel with finite number of nodes). In the\nnon-stationary regime of functioning of the channel one observes an exponential\nincrease or exponential decrease of the amount of substance in the nodes.\nDespite this the asymptotic distribution of the substance among the nodes of\nthe channel in this regime is stationary. The developed theory is applied for a\nstudy of the distrribution of migrants in countries that form migration\nchannels.\n", "  In this work, using the framework of (three-dimensional) Eshelbian\ndislocation mechanics, we derive the $J$-, $M$-, and $L$-integrals of a single\n(edge and screw) dislocation in isotropic elasticity as a limit of the $J$-,\n$M$-, and $L$-integrals between two straight dislocations as they have recently\nbeen derived by Agiasofitou and Lazar [Int. J. Eng. Sci. 114 (2017) 16-40].\nSpecial attention is focused on the $M$-integral. The $M$-integral of a single\ndislocation in anisotropic elasticity is also derived. The obtained results\nreveal the physical interpretation of the $M$-integral (per unit length) of a\nsingle dislocation as the total energy of the dislocation which is the sum of\nthe self-energy (per unit length) of the dislocation and the dislocation core\nenergy (per unit length). The latter can be identified with the work produced\nby the Peach-Koehler force. It is shown that the dislocation core energy (per\nunit length) is twice the corresponding pre-logarithmic energy factor. This\nresult is valid in isotropic as well as in anisotropic elasticity. The only\ndifference lies on the pre-logarithmic energy factor which is more complex in\nanisotropic elasticity due to the anisotropic energy coefficient tensor which\ncaptures the anisotropy of the material.\n", "  Several variants of nonlocal games have been considered in the study of\nquantum entanglement and nonlocality. This paper concerns two of these\nvariants, called quantum-classical games and extended nonlocal games. We give a\nconstruction of an extended nonlocal game from any quantum-classical game that\nallows one to translate certain facts concerning quantum- classical games to\nextended nonlocal games. In particular, based on work of Regev and Vidick, we\nconclude that there exist extended nonlocal games for which no\nfinite-dimensional entangled strategy can be optimal. While this conclusion is\na direct consequence of recent work of Slofstra, who proved a stronger,\nanalogous result for ordinary (non-extended) nonlocal games, the proof based on\nour construction is considerably simpler, and the construction itself might\npotentially have other applications in the study of entanglement and\nnonlocality.\n", "  The magnetic and structural properties of single crystal\nFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$V$_2$O$_{4}$ samples have been investigated by performing\nspecific heat, susceptibility, neutron diffraction, and X-ray diffraction\nmeasurements. As the orbital-active Fe$^{2+}$ ions with larger ionic size are\ngradually substituted by the orbital-inactive Co$^{2+}$ ions with smaller ionic\nsize, the system approaches the itinerant electron limit with decreasing V-V\ndistance. Then, various factors such as the Jahn-Teller distortion and the\nspin-orbital coupling of the Fe$^{2+}$ ions on the A sites and the orbital\nordering and electronic itinerancy of the V$^{3+}$ ions on the B sites compete\nwith each other to produce a complex magnetic and structural phase diagram.\nThis phase diagram is compared to those of Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$V$_2$O$_{4}$ and\nMn$_{1-x}$Co$_x$V$_2$O$_{4}$ to emphasize several distinct features.\n", "  Surface-functionalized nanomaterials can act as theranostic agents that\ndetect disease and track biological processes using hyperpolarized magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI). Candidate materials are sparse however, requiring\nspinful nuclei with long spin-lattice relaxation (T1) and spin-dephasing times\n(T2), together with a reservoir of electrons to impart hyperpolarization. Here,\nwe demonstrate the versatility of the nanodiamond material system for\nhyperpolarized 13C MRI, making use of its intrinsic paramagnetic defect\ncenters, hours-long nuclear T1 times, and T2 times suitable for spatially\nresolving millimeter-scale structures. Combining these properties, we enable a\nnew imaging modality that exploits the phase-contrast between spins encoded\nwith a hyperpolarization that is aligned, or anti-aligned with the external\nmagnetic field. The use of phase-encoded hyperpolarization allows nanodiamonds\nto be tagged and distinguished in an MRI based on their spin-orientation alone,\nand could permit the action of specific bio-functionalized complexes to be\ndirectly compared and imaged.\n", "  Spin Hall effects have surged as promising phenomena for spin logics\noperations without ferromagnets. However, the magnitude of the detected\nelectric signals at room temperature in metallic systems has been so far\nunderwhelming. Here, we demonstrate a two-order of magnitude enhancement of the\nsignal in monolayer graphene/Pt devices when compared to their fully metallic\ncounterparts. The enhancement stems in part from efficient spin injection and\nthe large resistivity of graphene but we also observe 100% spin absorption in\nPt and find an unusually large effective spin Hall angle of up to 0.15. The\nlarge spin-to-charge conversion allows us to characterise spin precession in\ngraphene under the presence of a magnetic field. Furthermore, by developing an\nanalytical model based on the 1D diffusive spin-transport, we demonstrate that\nthe effective spin-relaxation time in graphene can be accurately determined\nusing the (inverse) spin Hall effect as a means of detection. This is a\nnecessary step to gather full understanding of the consequences of spin\nabsorption in spin Hall devices, which is known to suppress effective spin\nlifetimes in both metallic and graphene systems.\n", "  Studies have shown that following exposure to particulate matter, the\nultrafine fraction (< 100 nm) may deposit along the respiratory tract down to\nthe alveolar region. To assess the effects of nanoparticles in the lungs, it is\nessential to address the question of their biophysicochemical interaction with\nthe different pulmonary environments, including the lung lining fluids and the\nepithelia. Here we examine one of these interactive scenarios and study the\nrole of supported lipid bilayers (SLB) on the fate of 40 nm fluorescent silica\nparticles towards living cells. We first study the particle phase behavior in\npresence of Curosurf, a pulmonary surfactant substitute used in replacement\ntherapies. It is found that Curosurf vesicles interact strongly with the\nnanoparticles, but do not spontaneously form SLBs. To achieve this goal, we use\nsonication to reshape the vesicular membranes and induce the lipid fusion\naround the particles. Centrifugal sedimentation and electron microscopy are\ncarried out to determine the optimum coating conditions and layer thickness. We\nthen explore the impact of surfactant SLBs on the cytotoxic potential and\ninteractions towards a malignant epithelial cell line. All in vitro assays\nindicate that SLBs mitigate the particle toxicity and internalization rates. In\nthe cytoplasm, the particle localization is also strongly coating dependent. It\nis concluded that SLBs profoundly affect cellular interactions and functions in\nvitro and could represent an alternative strategy for particle coating. The\ncurrent data also shed some light on potential mechanisms pertaining to the\nparticle or pathogen transport through the air-blood barrier.\n", "  In this paper, a way is given to obtain explicitly the representations of the\nPoincar\\'e group as can be prescribed by Geometric Quantization. Thus one\nobtains some forms of the Space of Quantum States of the different relativistic\nfree particles, and I give explicitly these spaces and the corresponding\noperators for the usually accepted as realistic physical particles. The general\ndescription of the massless particles I obtain, is given in terms of solutions\nof Penrose equations. In the case of Photon, I also give other descriptions,\none in terms of the Electromagnetic Field. Since the results are derived from\nGeometric Quantization, they are related to certain Contact and Symplectic\nmanifols, that I study in detail. The symplectic manifold must be interpreted,\naccording with Souriau, as the Movement Space of the corresponding classical\nparticle, and that leads to propose one of the spaces I use as the State Space\nof the corresponding classical particle. These spaces are also described in\neach case.\n", "  The inelastic nature of 3-phonon processes is investigated within the\nframework of perturbation theory and linearized Boltzmann Transport Equation.\nBy considering the energy conservation rule governing this type of interactions\nin a statistical average sense, the impact of different forms of the\nregularized energy-conserving Dirac delta function on 3-phonon scattering rates\nwas evaluated. Strikingly, adopting Lorentz distribution, in accordance with\nthe shape of eigenenergy broadening of phonon normal modes due to the leading\nterm of crystal anharmonicity, was found to play a critical role in activating\numklapp processes at low temperature, leading to intrinsic lattice thermal\nconductivity peak at finite temperature for perfect crystal. This\ncharacteristic behavior, unique to the Lorentzian, lays foundation for\ndeveloping adjustable-parameter-free computational models for reliable\nprediction of the finite lattice conductivity at low temperature, even in the\nabsence of extrinsic scattering processes. An iterative solution scheme for\nBoltzmann Transport Equation was used to compute the intrinsic thermal\nconductivity of solid argon over the entire temperature range (2-80 K). For the\nfirst time, the experimentally observed $T^2$ behavior in the low temperature,\n$T$, limit and the peak temperature (~ 8 K) were successfully recovered, in\naddition to the classical high temperature $T^{-1}$ behavior above 20 K by the\nsole use of 3-phonon processes. The good agreement with experiment indicates\nthat phonon-phonon interactions dominate over the entire temperature range in\nargon, contrary to previous hypotheses that phonon-defect scattering dominates\nthe sub-peak regime. Anisotropy in thermal conductivity of single crystal at\nlow temperature due to phonon focusing was observed. In addition, argon\nconductivity is underestimated by an order of magnitude in Single Mode\nRelaxation Time approximation.\n", "  Exploring giant magnetic anisotropy in small magnetic nanostructures is of\nboth fundamental interest and technological merit for information storage. To\nprevent spin flipping at room temperature due to thermal fluctuation, large\nmagnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) over 50 meV in magnetic nanostructure is\ndesired for practical applications. We chose one of the smallest magnetic\nnanostructures-Ir2 dimer, to investigate its magnetic properties and explore\npossible approach to engineer the magnetic anisotropy. Through systematic\nfirst-principles calculations, we found that the Ir2 dimer already possesses\ngiant MAE of 77 meV. We proposed an effective way to enhance the MAE of the Ir2\ndimer to 223~294 meV by simply attaching a halogen atom at one end of the Ir-Ir\nbond. The underlying mechanism for the record high MAE is attributed to the\nmodification of the energy diagram of the Ir2 dimer by the additional\nhalogen-Ir bonding, which alters the spin-orbit coupling Hamiltonian and hence\nthe magnetic anisotropy. Our strategy can be generalized to design other\nmagnetic molecules or clusters with giant magnetic anisotropy.\n", "  The MIGHTEE large survey project will survey four of the most well-studied\nextragalactic deep fields, totalling 20 square degrees to $\\mu$Jy sensitivity\nat Giga-Hertz frequencies, as well as an ultra-deep image of a single ~1 square\ndegree MeerKAT pointing. The observations will provide radio continuum,\nspectral line and polarisation information. As such, MIGHTEE, along with the\nexcellent multi-wavelength data already available in these deep fields, will\nallow a range of science to be achieved. Specifically, MIGHTEE is designed to\nsignificantly enhance our understanding of, (i) the evolution of AGN and\nstar-formation activity over cosmic time, as a function of stellar mass and\nenvironment, free of dust obscuration; (ii) the evolution of neutral hydrogen\nin the Universe and how this neutral gas eventually turns into stars after\nmoving through the molecular phase, and how efficiently this can fuel AGN\nactivity; (iii) the properties of cosmic magnetic fields and how they evolve in\nclusters, filaments and galaxies. MIGHTEE will reach similar depth to the\nplanned SKA all-sky survey, and thus will provide a pilot to the cosmology\nexperiments that will be carried out by the SKA over a much larger survey\nvolume.\n", "  We investigate the classical and quantum Proca field (a massive vector\npotential) of mass $m>0$ in arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetimes and in the\npresence of external sources. We motivate a notion of continuity in the mass\nfor families of observables $\\left\\{O_m\\right\\}_{m>0}$ and we investigate the\nmassless limit $m\\to0$. Our limiting procedure is local and covariant and it\ndoes not require a choice of reference state. We find that the limit exists\nonly on a subset of observables, which automatically implements a gauge\nequivalence on the massless vector potential. For topologically non-trivial\nspacetimes, one may consider several inequivalent choices of gauge equivalence\nand our procedure selects the one which is expected from considerations\ninvolving the Aharonov-Bohm effect and Gauss' law. We note that the limiting\ntheory does not automatically reproduce Maxwell's equation, but it can be\nimposed consistently when the external current is conserved. To recover the\ncorrect Maxwell dynamics from the limiting procedure would require an\nadditional control on limits of states. We illustrate this only in the\nclassical case, where the dynamics is recovered when the Lorenz constraint\nremains well behaved in the limit.\n", "  The paper reviews methods used to study the electronic and structural\nproperties of silicon/insulator interfaces. Methodological approaches to study\nthe interface states and charge trapping in the oxide are considered. An\noverview of archetypical structural defects of the Si/SiO2 interface is given.\n", "  It is conjectured that strongly coupled, spatially noncommutative\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills theory has a dual description as a weakly coupled\nopen string theory in a near critical electric field, and that this dual theory\nis fully decoupled from closed strings. Evidence for this conjecture is given\nby the absence of physical closed string poles in the non-planar one-loop open\nstring diagram. The open string theory can be viewed as living in a geometry in\nwhich space and time coordinates do not commute.\n", "  We find a new class of cosmic string solutions with non-vanishing magnetic\nflux of $\\mathcal{N}=1$, D=4 supergravity with a cosmological constant and\ncoupled to any number of Maxwell and scalar multiplets. We show that these\nmagnetic cosmic string solutions preserve 1/2 of supersymmetry. We give an\nexplicit example of such a solution for which the complex scalars are constant\nand the spacetime is smooth with topology $R^{1,1}\\times S^2$. Two more\nexamples are explored for which a complex scalar field takes values in\n$\\mathbb{C} P^1$ and in $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})/U(1)$.\n", "  We calculate the thermal partition function of DLCQ superstring on the\nmaximally supersymmetric pp-wave background, which is realized as the Penrose\nlimit of orbifolded $AdS_5\\times S^5$ and known to be dual to the\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ ``large'' quiver gauge theory as shown by S. Mukhi, M.\nRangamani and E. Verlinde, hep-th/0204147. Making use of the path-integral\ntechnique, we derive the manifestly modular invariant expression and show the\nequivalence with the free energy of second quantized free superstring on this\nbackground. The ``virtual strings'' wound around the temporal circle play\nessential roles for realizing the modular invariance and for a simple analysis\non the Hagedorn temperature. We also calculate the thermal one-loop amplitudes\nof open strings under the various backgrounds of the supersymmetric time-like\nand Euclidean D-branes, and confirm the existence of correct open-closed string\nduality. Furthermore, we extend these thermodynamical analysis to the\n6-dimensional DLCQ pp-waves with general RR and NSNS flux. These superstring\nvacua are similarly derived from the supersymmetric (half SUSY) and\nnon-supersymmetric orbifolds of $AdS_3 \\times S^3 \\times M^4$ ($M^4 =T^4 $ or\n$K3$) by the appropriate Penrose limits, giving rise to the SUSY enhancement as\nin the case of orbifolded $AdS_5 \\times S^5$.\n", "  The explicit (all-order in fermions) form of the kappa-symmetric $D3$ brane\nprobe action was previously found in the two maximally supersymmetric type IIB\nvacua: flat space and $AdS_5 \\times S^5$. Here we present the form of the\naction in the third maximally supersymmetric type IIB background: gravitational\nplane wave supported by constant null 5-form strength. We study $D3$ brane\naction in both covariant and light cone kappa symmetry gauges. Like the\nfundamental string action, the $D3$ brane action takes a simple form once\nwritten in the light cone kappa-symmetry gauge. We also consider the\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory in 4d plane wave background. Since some\n(super)symmetries of plane wave SYM action are friendly to (super)symmetries of\nthe type IIB superstring in plane wave Ramond-Ramond background we suggest this\nSYM model may be useful in the context of AdS/CFT duality. We develop the\nHamiltonian light cone gauge formulation for this theory.\n", "  The superfield light cone gauge formulation of $\\mathcal{N} =4$ SYM in plane\nwave background is developed. We find a realization of superconformal\nsymmetries in terms of a light cone superfield. An oscillator realization of\nsuperconformal symmetries is also obtained.\n", "  We study the duality of $\\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories in the presence of a\nmassless adjoint field and massive quarks by calculating the superpotential\nusing the Dighkgraaf-Vafa matrix model and by comparing with the previous\nresult coming from Kutasov duality. The Kutasov duality method gives a result\nin which one instanton term is absent. The matrix model method confirms it and\nalso show that the absence of the one instanton term is related to the\nmasslessness of the adjoint field.\n", "  We study rotating strings with multiple spins in the background of\n$AdS_5\\times T^{1,1}$, which is dual to a $\\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field\ntheory with global symmetry $SU(2)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)$ via the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. We analyse the limiting behaviour of macroscopic strings and\ndiscuss the identification of the dual operators and how their anomalous\ndimensions should behave as the global charges vary. A class of string\nsolutions we find are dual to operators in SU(2) subsector, and our result\nimplies that the one-loop planar dilatation operator restricted to the SU(2)\nsubsector should be equivalent to the hamiltonian of the integrable Heisenberg\nspin chain.\n", "  This thesis consists of two parts. In the first part we study some topics in\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmeric gauge theory and the relation to matrix models.\nWe review the relevant non-perturbative techniques for computing effective\nsuperpotential, such as Seiberg-Witten curve. Then we review the proposal of\nDijkgraaf and Vafa that relates the glueball superpotentials to the computation\nin matrix models. We then consider a case of multi-trace superpotential. We\nperform the perturbative computation of glueball superpotential in this case\nand explain the subtlety in identifying the glueball superfield. We also use\nthese techniques to study phases of $\\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory with flavors.\nIn the second part we study topics in AdS/CFT correspondence and its plane wave\nlimit. We review the plane wave geometry and BMN operators that corresponding\nto string modes. Then we study string interactions in the case of a highly\ncurved plane wave background, and demonstrate the agreements between\ncalculations of string interaction amplitudes in the two dual theories. Finally\nwe study D3-brane giant gravitons and open string attached to them. Giant\ngravitons are non-perturbative objects that have very large R-charge.\n", "  We study the duality group of $\\hat{A}_{n-1}$ quiver gauge theories,\nprimarily using their M5-brane construction. For $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry,\nthis duality group was first noted by Witten to be the mapping class group of a\ntorus with $n$ punctures. We find that it is a certain quotient of this group\nthat acts faithfully on gauge couplings. This quotient group contains the\naffine Weyl group of $\\hat{A}_{n-1}$, $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. In\nfact there are $n$ non-commuting $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ subgroups, related to each\nother by conjugation using the $\\mathbb{Z}_n$. When supersymmetry is broken to\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ by masses for the adjoint chiral superfields, an RG flow ensues\nwhich is believed to terminate at a CFT in the infrared. We find the explicit\naction of this duality group for small values of the adjoint masses, paying\nspecial attention to when the sum of the masses is non-zero. In the\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ CFT, Seiberg duality acts non-trivially on both gauge couplings\nand superpotential couplings and we interpret this duality as inherited from\nthe $\\mathcal{N}=2$ parent theory. We conjecture the action of S-duality in the\nCFT based on our results for small mass deformations. We also consider\nnon-conformal deformations of these $\\mathcal{N}=1$ theories. The cascading RG\nflows that ensue are a one-parameter generalization of those found by Klebanov\nand Strassler and by Cachazo {\\it et. al.}. The universality exhibited by these\nflows is shown to be a simple consequence of paths generated by the action of\nthe affine Weyl group.\n", "  We construct a $\\mathcal{Q}=1$ supersymmetry and $U(1)^5$ global symmetry\npreserving deformation of the type IIB matrix model. This model, without\norbifold projection, serves as a nonperturbative regularization for\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four Euclidean dimensions.\nUpon deformation, the eigenvalues of the bosonic matrices are forced to reside\non the surface of a hypertorus. We explicitly show the relation between the\nnoncommutative moduli space of the deformed matrix theory and the Brillouin\nzone of the emergent lattice theory. This observation makes the transmutation\nof the moduli space into the base space of target field theory clearer. The\nlattice theory is slightly nonlocal, however the nonlocality is suppressed by\nthe lattice spacing. In the classical continuum limit, we recover the\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory. We also discuss the result in terms of D-branes and\ninterpret it as collective excitations of D(-1) branes forming D3 branes.\n", "  We present a trace formula for an index over the spectrum of four dimensional\nsuperconformal field theories on $S^3 \\times $ time. Our index receives\ncontributions from states invariant under at least one supercharge and captures\nall information -- that may be obtained purely from group theory -- about\nprotected short representations in 4 dimensional superconformal field theories.\nIn the case of the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ theory our index is a function of four\ncontinuous variables. We compute it at weak coupling using gauge theory and at\nstrong coupling by summing over the spectrum of free massless particles in\n$AdS_5\\times S^5$ and find perfect agreement at large $N$ and small charges.\nOur index does not reproduce the entropy of supersymmetric black holes in\n$AdS_5$, but this is not a contradiction, as it differs qualitatively from the\npartition function over supersymmetric states of the ${\\cal N}=4$ theory. We\nnote that entropy for some small supersymmetric $AdS_5$ black holes may be\nreproduced via a D-brane counting involving giant gravitons. For big black\nholes we find a qualitative (but not exact) agreement with the naive counting\nof BPS states in the free Yang Mills theory. In this paper we also evaluate and\nstudy the partition function over the chiral ring in the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang\nMills theory.\n", "  We examine the relation between twisted versions of the extended\nsupersymmetric gauge theories and supersymmetric orbifold lattices. In\nparticular, for the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM in $d=4$, we show that the continuum\nlimit of orbifold lattice reproduces the twist introduced by Marcus, and the\nexamples at lower dimensions are usually Blau-Thompson type. The orbifold\nlattice point group symmetry is a subgroup of the twisted Lorentz group, and\nthe exact supersymmetry of the lattice is indeed the nilpotent scalar\nsupersymmetry of the twisted versions. We also introduce twisting in terms of\nspin groups of finite point subgroups of $R$-symmetry and spacetime symmetry.\n", "  We study supersymmetric AdS_4 x X_7 solutions of 11-dim supergravity where\nthe tri-Sasakian space X_7 has generically U(1)^2\\times SU(2)_R isometry. The\ncompact and regular 7-dim spaces X_7=S(t_1,t_2,t_3) is originated from 8-dim\nhyperkahler quotient of a 12-dim flat hyperkahler space by U(1) and belongs to\nthe class of the Eschenburg space. We calculate the volume of X_7 and that of\nthe supersymmetric five cycle via localization. From this we discuss the 3-dim\ndual superconformal field theories with \\CN=3 supersymmetry.\n", "  We propose a brane configuration for the (2+1)d, $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsuperconformal theories (CFT$_3$) arising from M2-branes probing toric\nCalabi-Yau 4-fold cones, using a T-duality transformation of M-theory. We\nobtain intersections of M5-branes on a three-torus which form a 3d bipartite\ncrystal lattice in a way similar to the 2d dimer models for CFT$_4$. The\nfundamental fields of the CFT$_3$ are M2-brane discs localized around the\nintersections, and the super-potential terms are identified with the atoms of\nthe crystal. The model correctly reproduces the complete BPS spectrum of mesons\nand baryons.\n", "  We consider generic properties of the moduli space of vacua in $N=2$\nsupersymmetric Yang--Mills theory recently studied by Seiberg and Witten. We\nfind, on general grounds, Picard--Fuchs type of differential equations\nexpressing the existence of a flat holomorphic connection, which for one\nparameter (i.e. for gauge group $G=SU(2)$), are second order equations. In the\ncase of coupling to gravity (as in string theory), where also ``gravitational''\nelectric and magnetic monopoles are present, the electric--magnetic S duality,\ndue to quantum corrections, does not seem any longer to be related to\n$Sl(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ as for $N=4$ supersymmetric theory.\n", "  We study the physics of the Seiberg-Witten and\nArgyres-Faraggi-Klemm-Lerche-Theisen-Yankielowicz solutions of $D=4$,\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\\mathcal{N}=1$ $SU(N)$ supersymmetric gauge theory. The\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ theory is confining and its effective Lagrangian is a\nspontaneously broken $U(1)^{N-1}$ abelian gauge theory. We identify some\nfeatures of its physics which see this internal structure, including a spectrum\nof different string tensions. We discuss the limit $N\\rightarrow\\infty$,\nidentify a scaling regime in which instanton and monopole effects survive, and\ngive exact results for the crossover from weak to strong coupling along a\nscaling trajectory. We find a large hierarchy of mass scales in the scaling\nregime, including very light $W$ bosons, and the absence of weak coupling. The\nlight $W$'s leave a novel imprint on the effective dual magnetic theory. The\neffective Lagrangian appears to be inadequate to understand the conventional\nlarge $N$ limit of the confining $\\mathcal{N}=1$ theory.\n", "  We consider the type IIA string compactified on the Calabi-Yau space given by\na degree 12 hypersurface in the weighted projective space ${\\bf P}^4_{(1, 1,\n2,2, 6)}$. We express the prepotential of the low-energy effective supergravity\ntheory in terms of a set of functions that transform covariantly under $PSL(2,\n\\mathbb{Z})$ modular transformations. These functions are then determined by\nmonodromy properties, by singularities at the massless monopole point of the\nmoduli space, and by $S \\leftrightarrow T$ exchange symmetry.\n", "  We investigate higher-dimensional analogues of the $bc$ systems of 2D RCFT.\nWhen coupled to gauge fields and Beltrami differentials defining integrable\nholomorphic structures the $bc$ partition functions can be explicitly evaluated\nusing anomalies and holomorphy. The resulting induced actions generalize the\nchiral algebras of 2D RCFT to $2n$ dimensions. Moreover, $bc$ systems in four\nand six dimensions are closely related to supersymmetric matter. In particular,\nwe show that $d=4, \\mathcal{N}=2$ hypermultiplets induce a theory of self-dual\nYang-Mills fields coupled to self-dual gravity. In this way the $bc$ systems\nfermionize both the algebraic sector of the $WZW_4$ theory, as defined by Losev\net. al., and the classical open $\\mathcal{N}_{ws}=2$ string.\n", "  We discuss topological theories, arising from the general $\\mathcal{N}=2$\ntwisted gauge theories. We initiate a program of their study in the\nGromov-Witten paradigm. We re-examine the low-energy effective abelian theory\nin the presence of sources and study the mixing between the various\n$p$-observables. We present the twisted superfield formalism which makes\nduality transformations transparent. We propose a scheme which uniquely fixes\nall the contact terms. We derive a formula for the correlation functions of\n$p$-observables on the manifolds of generalized simple type for $0 \\leq p \\leq\n4$ and on some manifolds with $b_{2}^{+} =1$. We study the theories with matter\nand explore the properties of universal instanton. We also discuss the\ncompactifications of higher dimensional theories. Some relations to sigma\nmodels of type $A$ and $B$ are pointed out and exploited.\n", "  We propose a few tests of Seiberg-Witten solutions of $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsupersymmetric gauge theories by the instanton calculus in twisted gauge\ntheories. We re-examine the low-energy effective abelian theory in the presence\nof sources and present the formalism which makes duality transformations\ntransparent and easily fixes all the contact terms in a broad class of\ntheories. We also discuss ADHM integration and its relevance to the stated\nproblems.\n", "  We introduce a $N_c\\times N_c$ matrix model with $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsupersymmetries and show its relation to the topological rigid string and the\ntopological YM$_2$. This allows to connect the latter two theories directly.\nMoreover the construction leads to a new insight in the \\ninfty limit. Finally\na quantum mechanical matrix theory is proposed which may describe light-cone\n(light-front) dynamics of gauge fields.\n", "  We study correlation functions in topologically twisted $\\mathcal{N}=2, d=4$\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for gauge groups of rank larger than one on\ncompact four-manifolds $X$. We find that the topological invariance of the\ngenerator of correlation functions of BRST invariant observables is not spoiled\nby noncompactness of field space. We show how to express the correlators on\nsimply connected manifolds of $b_{2,+}(X)>0$ in terms of Seiberg-Witten\ninvariants and the classical cohomology ring of $X$. For manifolds $X$ of\nsimple type and gauge group SU(N) we give explicit expressions of the\ncorrelators as a sum over $\\mathcal{N}=1$ vacua. We describe two applications\nof our expressions, one to superconformal field theory and one to large $N$\nexpansions of SU(N) $\\mathcal{N}=2, d=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  Extending recent work of Kachru and Silverstein, we consider ``orbifolds'' of\n4-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SU(n) super-Yang-Mills theories with respect to\ndiscrete subgroups of the SU(4) $R$-symmetry which act nontrivially on the\ngauge group. We show that for every discrete subgroup of SU(4) there is a\ncanonical choice of imbedding of the discrete group in the gauge group which\nleads to theories with a vanishing one-loop beta-function. We conjecture that\nthese give rise to (generically non-supersymmetric) conformal theories. The\ngauge group is $\\otimes_i SU(Nn_i)$ where $n_i$ denote the dimension of the\nirreducible representations of the corresponding discrete group; there is also\nbifundamental matter, dictated by associated quiver diagrams. The interactions\ncan also be read off from the quiver diagram. For SU(3) and SU(2) subgroups\nthis leads to superconformal theories with $\\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nrespectively. In the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ case we prove the vanishing of the beta\nfunctions to two loops.\n", "  We compute the principal contribution to the index in the supersymmetric\nquantum mechanical systems which are obtained by reduction to 0+1 dimensions of\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$, $D=4,6,10$ super-Yang-Mills theories with gauge group SU(N).\nThe results are: ${1\\over{N^{2}}}$ for $D=4,6$, $\\sum_{d | N} {1\\over{d^{2}}}$\nfor D=10. We also discuss the D=3 case.\n", "  We study Coulomb branch (``u-plane'') integrals for $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsupersymmetric $SU(2),SO(3)$ Yang-Mills theory on 4-manifolds $X$ of $b_1(X)>0,\nb_2^+(X)=1$. Using wall-crossing arguments we derive expressions for the\nDonaldson invariants for manifolds with $b_1(X)>0, b_2^+(X)>0$. Explicit\nexpressions for $X=\\IC P^1 \\times F_g$, where $F_g$ is a Riemann surface of\ngenus $g$ are obtained using Kronecker's double series identity. The result\nmight be useful in future studies of quantum cohomology.\n", "  We study all three-point functions of normalized chiral operators in D=4,\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$, U(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the large $N$ limit.\nWe compute them for small 't Hooft coupling $\\lambda=g_{YM}^2N<<1$ using free\nfield theory and at strong coupling $\\lambda=g_{YM}^2>>1$ using the $AdS$/CFT\ncorrespondence. Surprisingly, we find the same answers in the two limits. We\nconjecture that at least for large $N$ the exact answers are independent of\n$\\lambda $ .\n", "  We consider attractor varieties arising in the construction of dyonic black\nholes in Calabi-Yau compactifications of IIB string theory. We show that the\nattractor varieties are constructed from products of elliptic curves with\ncomplex multiplication for $\\mathcal{N}=4,8$ compactifications. The heterotic\ndual theories are related to rational conformal field theories. The emergence\nof curves with complex multiplication suggests many interesting connections\nbetween arithmetic and string theory. This paper is a brief overview of a\nlonger companion paper entitled ``Arithmetic and Attractors,'' hep-th/9807087.\n", "  We use the anomaly cancellation of the M-theory fivebrane to derive the\nR-symmetry anomalies of the $A_{N}$ $(0,2)$ tensor-multiplet theories. This\nresult leads to a simple derivation of black hole entropy in $d=4,\n\\mathcal{N}=2$ compactifications of $M$-theory. We also show how the formalism\nof normal bundle anomaly cancellation clarifies the Kaluza-Klein origin of\nChern-Simons terms in gauged supergravity theories. The results imply the\nexistence of interesting 1/N corrections in the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n", "  We explicitly evaluate the low energy coupling $F_g$ in a $d=4,\\mathcal{N}=2$\ncompactification of the heterotic string. The holomorphic piece of this\nexpression provides the information not encoded in the holomorphic anomaly\nequations, and we find that it is given by an elementary polylogarithm with\nindex $3-2g$, thus generalizing in a natural way the known results for $g=0,1$.\nThe heterotic model has a dual Calabi-Yau compactification of the type II\nstring. We compare the answer with the general form expected from\ncurve-counting formulae and find good agreement. As a corollary of this\ncomparison we predict some numbers of higher genus curves in a specific\nCalabi-Yau, and extract some intersection numbers on the moduli space of genus\n$g$ Riemann surfaces.\n", "  This paper lays groundwork for the detailed study of the non-trivial\nrenormalization group flow connecting supersymmetric fixed points in four\ndimensions using string theory on AdS spaces. Specifically, we consider\nD3-branes placed at singularities of Calabi-Yau threefolds which generalize the\nconifold singularity and have an ADE classification. The $\\mathcal{N}=1$\nsuperconformal theories dictating their low-energy dynamics are infrared fixed\npoints arising from deforming the corresponding ADE $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsuperconformal field theories by mass terms for adjoint chiral fields. We probe\nthe geometry with a single $D3$-brane and discuss the near-horizon supergravity\nsolution for a large number $N$ of coincident $D3$-branes.\n", "  We consider D-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with 8 supercharges\n(D<6,$~\\mathcal{N}=8$) in the framework of harmonic superspaces. The effective\nAbelian low-energy action for D=5 contains the free and Chern-Simons terms.\nEffective $\\mathcal{N}=8$ superfield actions for D<4 can be written in terms of\nthe superpotentials satisfying the superfield constraints and (6-D)-dimensional\nLaplace equations. The role of alternative harmonic structures is discussed.\n", "  Models of interactions of D-dimensional hypermultiplets and supersymmetric\ngauge multiplets with $\\mathcal{N}=8$ supercharges $(D{\\leq} 6)$ can be\nformulated in the framework of harmonic superspaces. The effective Coulomb\nlow-energy action for D=5 includes the free and Chern-Simons terms. We consider\nalso the non-Abelian superfield D=5 Chern-Simons action. The biharmonic\n$D=3,\\mathcal{N}=8$ superspace is introduced for a description of l and r\nsupermultiplets and the mirror symmetry. The D=2,(4,4) gauge theory and\nhypermultiplet interactions are considered in the triharmonic superspace.\nConstraints for $D{=}1,\\mathcal{N}{=}8$ supermultiplets are solved with the\nhelp of the $SU(2){\\times}Spin(5)$ harmonics. Effective gauge actions in the\nfull $D{\\leq}3,\\mathcal{N}{=}8$ superspaces contain constrained (harmonic)\nsuperpotentials satisfying the (6-D) Laplace equations for the gauge group U(1)\nor corresponding (6-D)p-dimensional equations for the gauge groups $[U(1)]^p$.\nGeneralized harmonic representations of superpotentials connect equivalent\nsuperfield structures of these theories in the full and analytic superspaces.\nThe harmonic approach simplifies the proofs of non-renormalization theorems.\n", "  We show that the $\\mathcal{N}=0$ theories on the self-dual D3-branes of Type\n0 string theory are in the class of the previously considered tadpole-free\norbifolds of $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ theory (although they have SO(6) global\nsymmetry) and hence have vanishing beta function in the planar limit to all\norders in 't Hooft coupling. Also, all planar amplitudes in this theory are\nequal to those of $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ theory, up to a rescaling of the coupling.\n", "  We derive a $U$-duality invariant formula for the degeneracies of BPS\nmultiplets in a D1-D5 system for toroidal compactification of the type II\nstring. The elliptic genus for this system vanishes, but it is found that BPS\nstates can nevertheless be counted using a certain topological partition\nfunction involving two insertions of the fermion number operator. This is\npossible due to four extra toroidal U(1) symmetries arising from a Wigner\ncontraction of a large $\\mathcal{N}=4$ algebra $\\mathcal{A}_{\\kappa,\\kappa'}$\nfor $\\kappa' \\to \\infty$. We also compare the answer with a counting formula\nderived from supergravity on $AdS_3\\times S^3 \\times T^4$ and find agreement\nwithin the expected range of validity.\n", "  We derive the partition function for the Vafa-Witten twist of the\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge group SU(N) (for prime\n$N$) and arbitrary values of the 't Hooft fluxes $v\\in H^{2}(X,\\mathbb{Z}_{N})$\non K\\\"ahler four-manifolds with $b^{+}_2>1$.\n", "  We derive the complete $(curvature)^2$ terms of effective D-brane actions,\nfor arbitrary ambient geometries and world-volume embeddings, at lowest order\n(disk-level) in the string-loop expansion. These terms reproduce the\n$o(\\alpha'^2)$ corrections to string scattering amplitudes, and are consistent\nwith duality conjectures. In the particular case of the D3-brane with trivial\nnormal bundle, considerations of $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ invariance lead to a\ncomplete sum of D-instanton corrections for both the parity-conserving and the\nparity-violating parts of the effective action. These corrections are required\nfor the cancellation of the modular anomalies of massless modes, and are\nconsistent with the absence of chiral anomalies in the intersection domain of\npairs of D-branes. We also show that the parity-conserving part of the\nnon-perturbative R^2 action follows from a one-loop quantum calculation in the\nsix-dimensional world-volume of the M5-brane compactified on a two-torus.\n", "  We study various three-dimensional supersymmetric Maxwell Chern-Simons\nsolitons by using type IIB brane configurations. We give a systematic\nclassification of soliton spectra such as topological BPS vortices and\nnontopological vortices in $\\mathcal{N}=2,3$ supersymmetric Maxwell\nChern-Simons system via the branes of type IIB string theory. We identify the\nbrane configurations with the soliton spectra of the field theory and obtain a\nnice agreement with field theory aspects. We also discuss possible brane\nconstructions for BPS domain wall solutions.\n", "  When an M-theory fivebrane wraps a holomorphic surface $\\mathcal{P}$ in a\nCalabi-Yau 3-fold $X$ the low energy dynamics is that of a black string in 5\ndimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity. The infrared dynamics on the string\nworldsheet is an $\\mathcal{N} = (0,4)$ 2D conformal field theory. Assuming the\n2D CFT can be described as a nonlinear sigma model, we describe the target\nspace geometry of this model in terms of the data of $X$ and $\\mathcal{P}$.\nVariations of weight two Hodge structures enter the construction of the model\nin an interesting way.\n", "  We investigate nonperturbative effects in M-theory compactifications arising\nfrom wrapped membranes. In particular, we show that in $d=4, \\mathcal{N}=1$\ncompactifications along manifolds of $G_2$ holonomy, membranes wrapped on rigid\nsupersymmetric 3-cycles induce nonzero corrections to the superpotential. Thus,\nmembrane instantons destabilize many M-theory compactifications. Our\ncomputation shows that the low energy description of membrane physics is\nusefully described in terms of three-dimensional topological field theories,\nand the superpotential is expressed in terms of topological invariants of the\n3-cycle. We discuss briefly some applications of these results. For example,\nusing mirror symmetry we derive a counting formula for supersymmetric\nthree-cycles in certain Calabi-Yau manifolds.\n", "  We study the exchange diagrams in the computation of four-point functions of\nall chiral primary operators in D=4, $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills using\nAdS/CFT correspondence. We identify all supergravity fields that can be\nexchanged and compute the cubic couplings. As a byproduct, we also rederive the\nnormalization of the quadratic action of the exchanged fields. The cubic\ncouplings computed in this paper and the propagators studied extensively in the\nliterature can be used to compute almost all the exchange diagrams explicitly.\nSome issues in computing the complete four-point function in the massless\nsector is discussed.\n"]}
