They\nare prodigious emitters of neutrinos and quite likely strong galactic sources\nof gravitational waves. Observation of both neutrinos and gravitational waves\nfrom the next galactic or near extragalactic core-collapse supernova will yield\na wealth of information on the explosion mechanism, but also on the structure\nand angular momentum of the progenitor star, and on aspects of fundamental\nphysics such as the equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities and\nlow entropies. In this contribution to the proceedings of the Neutrino 2012\nconference, we summarize recent progress made in the theoretical understanding\nand modeling of core-collapse supernovae. In this, our emphasis is on\nmulti-dimensional processes involved in the explosion mechanism such as\nneutrino-driven convection and the standing accretion shock instability. As an\nexample of how supernova neutrinos can be used to probe fundamental physics, we\ndiscuss how the rise time of the electron antineutrino flux observed in\ndetectors can be used to probe the neutrino mass hierarchy. Finally, we lay out\naspects of the neutrino and gravitational-wave signature of core-collapse\nsupernovae and discuss the power of combined analysis of neutrino and\ngravitational wave data from the next galactic core-collapse supernova.\n", "  Cha-MMS1 was mapped in the NH_3(1,1) line and the 1.2 cm continuum using the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array, ATCA. The angular resolution of the ATCA\nobservations is 7'' (~ 1000 AU), and the velocity resolution is 50 m s^{-1}.\nThe core was also mapped with the 64-m Parkes telesope in the NH_3(1,1) and\n(2,2) lines. Observations from Herschel Space Observatory and Spitzer Space\ntelescope were used to help interpretation. A compact high column density core\nwith a steep velocity gradient is detected in ammonia, with a fractional\nammonia abundance compatible with determinations towards other dense cores. The\ndirection of the velocity gradient agrees with previous single-dish\nobservations, and the overall velocity distribution can be interpreted as\nrotation. The rotation axis goes through the position of a compact far-infrared\nsource detected by Spitzer and Herschel. The specific angular momentum of the\ncore is typical for protostellar envelopes. A string of 1.2 cm continuum\nsources is tentatively detected near the rotation axis. The ammonia spectra\nsuggest the presence of warm embedded gas in its vicinity. An hourglass-shaped\nstructure is seen in ammonia at the cloud's average LSR velocity, also aligned\nwith the rotation axis. Although this structure resembles a pair of outflow\nlobes the ammonia spectra show no indications of shocked gas. The observed\nammonia structure mainly delineates the inner envelope around the central\nsource. The velocity gradient is likely to originate in the angular momentum of\nthe contracting core, although influence of the outflow from the neighbouring\nyoung star IRS4 is possibly visible on one side of the core. The tentative\ncontinuum detection and the indications of a warm background component near the\nrotation axis suggest that the core contains a deeply embedded outflow which\nmay have been missed in previous single-dish CO surveys owing to beam dilution.\n", "  Recently the space of tree level color structures for gluon scattering was\ndetermined in arXiv:1403.6837 together with its transformation properties under\npermutations. Here we generalize the discussion to loops, demonstrating a\nreduction of an arbitrary color diagram to its vacuum skeleton plus rays. For\n1-loop there are no residual relations and we determine the space of color\nstructures both diagrammatically and algebraically in terms of certain sunny\ndiagrams. We present the generating function for the characteristic polynomials\nand a list of irreducible representations for $3 \\le n \\le 9$ external legs.\nFinally we present a new proof for the 1-loop shuffle relations based on the\ncyclic shuffle and split operations.\n", "  Motivated by the importance of symplectic isotropic realisations in the study\nof Poisson manifolds, this paper investigates the local and global theory of\ncontact isotropic realisations of Jacobi manifolds, which are those of minimal\ndimension. These arise naturally when considering multiplicity-free actions in\ncontact geometry, as shown in this paper. The main results concern a\nclassification of these realisations up to a suitable notion of isomorphism, as\nwell as establishing a relation between the existence of symplectic and contact\nisotropic realisations for Poisson manifolds. The main tool is the classical\nSpencer operator which is related to Jacobi structures via their associated Lie\nalgebroid, which allows to generalise previous results as well as providing\nmore conceptual proofs for existing ones.\n", "  Shape dynamics is a reformulation of general relativity, locally equivalent\nto Einstein's theory, in which the refoliation invariance of the older theory\nis traded for local scale invariance. Shape dynamics is here derived in a\nformulation related to the Ashtekar variables by beginning with a modification\nof the Plebanski action. The constraints of shape dynamics and their algebra\nare reproduced in terms of these new variables.\n", "  In this Chapter we would like to review a \"~phenomenological~\" approach\ntaking into account the most fundamental feature of string theory or, more in\ngeneral, of quantum gravity, whatever its origin, which is the existence of a\nminimal length in the space-time fabric. This length is generally identified\nwith the Planck length, or the string length, but it could be also much longer\ndown to the TeV region. A simple and effective way to keep track of the effects\nthe minimal length in black hole geometries is to solve the Einstein equations\nwith an energy momentum tensor describing non point-like matter. The immediate\nconsequence is the absence of any curvature singularity. Where textbook\nsolutions of the Einstein equations loose any physical meaning because of\ninfinite tidal forces, we find a de Sitter vacuum core of high, but finite,\nenergy density and pressure. An additional improvement regards the final stage\nof the black hole evaporation leading to a vanishing Hawking temperature even\nin the neutral, non-rotating, case. In spite of th simplicity of this model we\nare able to describe the final stage of the black hole evaporation, resulting\nin a cold remnant with a degenerate, extremal, horizon of radius of the order\nof the minimal length. In this chapter we shall describe only neutral,\nspherically symmetric, regular black holes although charged, rotating and\nhigher dimensional black holes can be found in the literature.\n", "  We study the totally asymmetric exclusion process on the positive integers\nwith a single particle source at the origin. Liggett (1975) has shown that the\nlong term behaviour of this process has a phase transition: If the particle\nproduction rate at the source is below a critical value, the stationary measure\nis a product measure, otherwise the stationary measure is spatially correlated.\nFollowing the approach of Derrida et al. (1993) it was shown by Gro{\\ss}kinsky\n(2004) that these correlations can be described by means of a matrix product\nrepresentation. In this paper we derive a large deviation principle with\nexplicit rate function for the particle density in a macroscopic box based on\nthis representation. The novel and rigorous technique we develop for this\nproblem combines spectral theoretical and combinatorial ideas and has the\npotential to be applicable to other models described by matrix products.\n", "  The universe is magnetized on all scales probed so far. On the largest\nscales, galaxies and galaxy clusters host magnetic fields at the micro Gauss\nlevel coherent on scales up to ten kpc. Recent observational evidence suggests\nthat even the intergalactic medium in voids could host a weak $\\sim 10^{-16}$\nGauss magnetic field, coherent on Mpc scales. An intriguing possibility is that\nthese observed magnetic fields are a relic from the early universe, albeit one\nwhich has been subsequently amplified and maintained by a dynamo in collapsed\nobjects. We review here the origin, evolution and signatures of primordial\nmagnetic fields. After a brief summary of magnetohydrodynamics in the expanding\nuniverse, we turn to magnetic field generation during inflation and other phase\ntransitions. We trace the linear and nonlinear evolution of the generated\nprimordial fields through the radiation era, including viscous effects.\nSensitive observational signatures of primordial magnetic fields on the cosmic\nmicrowave background, including current constraints from Planck, are discussed.\nAfter recombination, primordial magnetic fields could strongly influence\nstructure formation, especially on dwarf galaxy scales. The resulting\nsignatures on reionization, the redshifted 21 cm line, weak lensing and the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest are outlined. Constraints from radio and $\\gamma$-ray\nastronomy are summarized. Astrophysical batteries and the role of dynamos in\nreshaping the primordial field are briefly considered. The review ends with\nsome final thoughts on primordial magnetic fields.\n", "  The influence of a saturable nonlinearity on the modulation instability in\noppositely directed coupler in the presence of high-order effects is\ninvestigated. By using the standard linear stability analysis, we obtain the\ninstability gain that exhibits a significant change in the bands of instability\ndue to the effects of a saturable nonlinearity. We also show that even in the\npresence of saturation there is no change in instability gain when we compare\nthe results obtained for both channels not influenced by self-steepening effect\nor for both channels influenced by self-steepening effect but opposite in sign.\nRegarding the Raman effect, there is reflection symmetry (asymmetry) to the\ngain at zero perturbation frequency when the values of the Raman coefficients\nin each directional coupler are equal and with same (opposite) sign. For the\nanomalous group velocity dispersion regime we observe that the growth of the\nsaturation parameter is followed by an increase in the null gain region near\n{\\Omega} = 0, enlarging the separation of the instability bands close to this\npoint. Finally, we show that an efficient control of the modulation instability\ncan be realized by adjusting self-steepening effect and intrapulse Raman\nscattering, even in the presence of a saturable nonlinearity.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to solve a fault tolerant filtering and fault\ndetection problem for a class of open quantum systems driven by a\ncontinuous-mode bosonic input field in single photon states when the systems\nare subject to stochastic faults. Optimal estimates of both the system\nobservables and the fault process are simultaneously calculated and\ncharacterized by a set of coupled recursive quantum stochastic differential\nequations.\n", "  Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are productions of the hierarchical\ngalaxy formation model. There are many close connections between central SMBH\nand its host galaxy because the former plays very important roles on the\nformation and evolution of a galaxy. For this reason, the evolution of SMBHBs\nin merging galaxies is an essential problem. Since there are many discussions\nabout SMBHB evolution in gas rich environment, we focus on the quiescent\ngalaxy, using tidal disruption as a diagnostic tool. Our study is based on a\nseries of numerical large particle number direct N-body simulations for dry\nmajor mergers. According to the simulation results, the evolution can be\ndivided into three phases. In phase I, the tidal disruption rate for two well\nseparated SMBHs in merging system has similar level to single SMBH in isolate\ngalaxy. After two SMBHs getting close enough to form a bound binary in phase\nII, the disruption rate can be enhanced for ~ 2 order of magnitudes within a\nshort time. This \"boosted\" disruption stage finishes after the SMBHB evolving\nto compact binary system in phase III, corresponding to a drop back of\ndisruption rate to a level of a few times higher than that in Phase I. How to\ncorrectly extrapolate our N-body simulation results to reality, and\nimplications of our results to observations, are discussed too.\n", "  In this note we study the reduction of 4d Seiberg duality to 3d for SP(2N)\nSQCD with an adjoint field. We follow a general prescription that consists in\ncompactifying the dual 4d theories on the circle. This generates an effective\n3d duality. The pure 3d duality is obtained by combining the zero radius limit\nwith a real mass flow. Here we perform this limit by a double scaling\nprocedure: we turn on real masses proportional to the radius before shrinking\nthe circle. We apply this mechanism to the reduction of the 4d superconformal\nindex to the three sphere partition function. While the reduction of the 4d\nindex on the circle is straightforward, the 3d limit necessitates the double\nscaling. We describe this limit on the index, finding the integral identity for\nthe partition functions of the 3d dual theories.\n", "  We report photon-noise limited performance of horn-coupled, aluminum\nlumped-element kinetic inductance detectors at millimeter wavelengths. The\ndetectors are illuminated by a millimeter-wave source that uses an active\nmultiplier chain to produce radiation between 140 and 160 GHz. We feed the\nmultiplier with either amplified broadband noise or a continuous-wave tone from\na microwave signal generator. We demonstrate that the detector response over a\n40 dB range of source power is well-described by a simple model that considers\nthe number of quasiparticles. The detector noise-equivalent power (NEP) is\ndominated by photon noise when the absorbed power is greater than approximately\n1 pW, which corresponds to $\\mathrm{NEP} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-17} \\,\n\\mathrm{W} \\, \\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$, referenced to absorbed power. At higher\nsource power levels we observe the relationships between noise and power\nexpected from the photon statistics of the source signal: $\\mathrm{NEP} \\propto\nP$ for broadband (chaotic) illumination and $\\mathrm{NEP} \\propto P^{1/2}$ for\ncontinuous-wave (coherent) illumination.\n", "  We consider the problem of IR divergences of the action in the covariant\nformulation of teleparallel gravity in asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes. We\nshow that divergences are caused by inertial effects and can be removed by\nadding an appropriate surface term, leading to the renormalized action. This\nprocess can be viewed as a teleparallel analogue of holographic\nrenormalization. Moreover, we explore the variational problem in teleparallel\ngravity and explain how the variation with respect to the spin connection\nshould be performed.\n", "  In the semi-classical description of the flux-tube fragmentation process for\nhadron production and hadronization in high-energy $e^+e^-$ annihilations and\n$pp$ collisions, the rapidity-space-time ordering and the local conservation\nlaws of charge, flavor, and momentum provide a set of powerful tools that may\nallow the reconstruction of the space-time dynamics of quarks and mesons in\nexclusive measurements of produced hadrons, on an event-by-event basis. We\npropose procedures to reconstruct the space-time dynamics from event-by-event\nexclusive hadron data to exhibit explicitly the ordered chain of hadrons\nproduced in a flux tube fragmentation. As a supplementary tool, we infer the\naverage space-time coordinates of the $q$-$\\bar q$ pair production vertices\nfrom the $\\pi^-$ rapidity distribution data obtained by the NA61/SHINE\nCollaboration in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 6.3 to 17.3 GeV.\n", "  Metamaterials are artificially structured media that can focus (lensing) or\nreroute (cloaking) waves, and typically this is developed for electromagnetic\nwaves at millimetric down to nanometric scales or for acoustics or thin elastic\nplates at centimeter scales. Extending the concepts of Kadic et al. 2013 we\nshow that the underlying ideas are generic across wave systems and scales by\ngeneralizing these concepts to seismic waves at frequencies, and lengthscales\nof the order of hundreds of meters, relevant to civil engineering. By applying\nideas from transformation optics we can manipulate and steer Rayleigh surface\nwave solutions of the vector Navier equations of elastodynamics; this is\nunexpected as this vector system is, unlike Maxwell's electromagnetic\nequations, not form invariant under transformations. As a paradigm of the\nconformal geophysics that we are creating, we design a square arrangement of\nLuneburg lenses to reroute and then refocus Rayleigh waves around a building\nwith the dual aim of protection and minimizing the effect on the wavefront\n(cloaking) after exiting the lenses. To show that this is practically\nrealisable we deliberately choose to use material parameters readily available\nand this metalens consists of a composite soil structured with buried pillars\nmade of softer material. The regular lattice of inclusions is homogenized to\ngive an effective material with a radially varying velocity profile that can be\ndirectly interpreted as a lens refractive index. We develop the theory and then\nuse full 3D time domain numerical simulations to conclusively demonstrate the\nvalidity of the transformation seismology ideas: we demonstrate, at frequencies\nof seismological relevance 3-10 Hz, and for low speed sedimentary soil ($v_s$:\n300-500 m/s), that the vibration of a structure is reduced by up to 6 dB at its\nresonance frequency.\n", "  We show that the diagonal elements of the second-order reduced density matrix\n(RDM2) can be chosen as basic variables for describing the superconducting\nstate, instead of the off-diagonal elements of the RDM2 that are usually\nadopted as basic variables in the density functional scheme. The diagonal\nelements of the RDM2 are called pair-density (PD), which is explicitly related\nto the fluctuation of the particle number of the system. In this paper, we\nargue that the fluctuation of the particle number can become an indication of\nthe superconducting state, and that the density functional scheme in which the\nPD is chosen as a basic variable would be a promising first-principles theory\nfor superconductors.\n", "  The topological materials have attracted much attention recently. While\nthree-dimensional topological insulators are becoming abundant, two-dimensional\ntopological insulators remain rare, particularly in natural materials. ZrTe5\nhas host a long-standing puzzle on its anomalous transport properties; its\nunderlying origin remains elusive. Lately, ZrTe5 has ignited renewed interest\nbecause it is predicted that single-layer ZrTe5 is a two-dimensional\ntopological insulator and there is possibly a topological phase transition in\nbulk ZrTe5. However, the topological nature of ZrTe5 is under debate as some\nexperiments point to its being a three-dimensional or quasi-two-dimensional\nDirac semimetal. Here we report high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved\nphotoemission measurements on ZrTe5. The electronic property of ZrTe5 is\ndominated by two branches of nearly-linear-dispersion bands at the Brillouin\nzone center. These two bands are separated by an energy gap that decreases with\ndecreasing temperature but persists down to the lowest temperature we measured\n(~2 K). The overall electronic structure exhibits a dramatic temperature\ndependence; it evolves from a p-type semimetal with a hole-like Fermi pocket at\nhigh temperature, to a semiconductor around ~135 K where its resistivity\nexhibits a peak, to an n-type semimetal with an electron-like Fermi pocket at\nlow temperature. These results indicate a clear electronic evidence of the\ntemperature-induced Lifshitz transition in ZrTe5. They provide a natural\nunderstanding on the underlying origin of the resistivity anomaly at ~135 K and\nits associated reversal of the charge carrier type. Our observations also\nprovide key information on deciphering the topological nature of ZrTe5 and\npossible temperature-induced topological phase transition.\n", "  Periodic driving of a quantum system can enable new topological phases with\nno analog in static systems. In this paper we systematically classify\none-dimensional topological and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in\ninteracting fermionic and bosonic quantum systems subject to periodic driving,\nwhich we dub Floquet SPTs (FSPTs). For physical realizations of interacting\nFSPTs, many-body localization by disorder is a crucial ingredient, required to\nobtain a stable phase that does not catastrophically heat to infinite\ntemperature. We demonstrate that bosonic and fermionic FSPTs phases are\nclassified by the same criteria as equilibrium phases, but with an enlarged\nsymmetry group $\\tilde G$, that now includes discrete time translation symmetry\nassociated with the Floquet evolution. In particular, 1D bosonic FSPTs are\nclassified by projective representations of the enlarged symmetry group\n$H^2({\\tilde G},U(1))$. We construct explicit lattice models for a variety of\nsystems, and then formalize the classification to demonstrate the completeness\nof this construction. We also derive general constraints on localization and\nsymmetry based on the representation theory of the symmetry group, and show\nthat symmetry-preserving localized phases are possible only for Abelian\nsymmetry groups. In particular, this rules out the possibility of many-body\nlocalized SPTs with continuous spin symmetry.\n", "  Phase transitions significantly differ between two-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional systems, but the influence of dimensionality on the glass\ntransition is unresolved. We use microscopy to study colloidal systems as they\napproach their glass transitions at high concentrations, and find differences\nbetween 2D and 3D. We find that in 2D particles can undergo large displacements\nwithout changing their position relative to their neighbors, in contrast with\n3D. This is related to Mermin-Wagner long-wavelength fluctuations that\ninfluence phase transitions in 2D. However, when measuring particle motion only\nrelative to their neighbors, 2D and 3D have similar behavior as the glass\ntransition is approached, showing that the long wavelength fluctuations do not\ncause a fundamental distinction between 2D and 3D glass transitions.\n", "  In this paper we abandon the idea that even a \"quantum\" black hole, of Planck\nsize, can still be described as a classical, more or less complicated,\ngeometry. Rather, we consider a genuine quantum mechanical approach where a\nPlanckian black hole is, by all means, just another \"particle\", even if with a\ndistinguishing property: its linear size increases with the energy. The horizon\ndynamics is equivalently described in terms of a particle moving in\ngravitational potential derived from the horizon equation itself in a\nself-consistent manner. The particle turning-points match the radius of the\ninner and outer horizons of a charged black hole. This classical model pave the\nway towards the wave equation for a truly quantum black hole. We compute the\nexact form of the wave function and determine the energy spectrum. Finally, we\ndescribe the classical limit in which the quantum picture correctly approaches\nthe classical geometric formulation. We find that the quantum-to-classical\ntransition occurs far above the Planck scale.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the Hamiltonian constraints of the\nd-dimensional tetrad-connection gravity where the non-dynamical part of the\nspatial connection is fixed to zero by an adequate guage transformation. This\nnew action depending on the co-tetrad and the dynamical part of the spatial\nconnection leads to Lorentz, scalar and vectorial first-class polynomial\nconstraints obeying a closed algebra in terms of Poisson brackets. This algebra\ncloses on the structure constants instead of structure functions resulting from\nthe Hamiltonian formalisms based on the A.D.M. decomposition. The same algebra\nof the reduced first-class constraints defined on the reduced phase-space,\nwhere the second-class constraints are solved, is obtained in terms of Dirac\nbrackets. These first-class constraintslead to the same physical degrees of\nfreedom of the general relativity. PACS numbers: 04.20.Cv, 04.20.Fy, 11.10.Ef,\n11.30.Cp\n", "  Current experiments do not exclude the possibility that one or more neutrinos\nare very slightly superluminal or that they have a very small tachyonic mass.\nImportant bounds on the size of a hypothetical tachyonic neutrino mass term are\nset by lepton pair Cerenkov radiation (LPCR), i.e., by the decay channel nu ->\ne^+ e^- nu which proceeds via a virtual Z0 boson. Here, we use a\nLorentz-invariant dispersion relation which leads to very tight constraints on\nthe tachyonic mass of neutrinos; we also calculate decay and energy loss rates.\nA possible cutoff seen in the IceCube neutrino spectrum for E_nu > 2 PeV, due\nto the potential onset of LPCR, is discussed.\n", "  Knowledge of the neutrino flux produced by the Neutrinos at the Main Injector\n(NuMI) beamline is essential to the neutrino oscillation and neutrino\ninteraction measurements of the MINERvA, MINOS+, NOvA and MicroBooNE\nexperiments at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. We have produced a flux\nprediction which uses all available and relevant hadron production data,\nincorporating measurements of particle production off of thin targets as well\nas measurements of particle yields from a spare NuMI target exposed to a 120\nGeV proton beam. The result is the most precise flux prediction achieved for a\nneutrino beam in the one to tens of GeV energy region. We have also compared\nthe prediction to in situ measurements of the neutrino flux and find good\nagreement.\n", "  The Sheldon spectrum describes a remarkable regularity in aquatic ecosystems:\nthe biomass density as a function of logarithmic body mass is approximately\nconstant over many orders of magnitude. While size-spectrum models have\nexplained this phenomenon for assemblages of multicellular organisms, this\npaper introduces a species-resolved size-spectrum model to explain the\nphenomenon in unicellular plankton. A Sheldon spectrum spanning the cell-size\nrange of unicellular plankton necessarily consists of a large number of\ncoexisting species covering a wide range of characteristic sizes. The\ncoexistence of many phytoplankton species feeding on a small number of\nresources is known as the Paradox of the Plankton. Our model resolves the\nparadox by showing that coexistence is facilitated by the allometric scaling of\nfour physiological rates. Two of the allometries have empirical support, the\nremaining two emerge from predator-prey interactions exactly when the\nabundances follow a Sheldon spectrum. Our plankton model is a scale-invariant\ntrait-based size-spectrum model: it describes the abundance of phyto- and\nzooplankton cells as a function of both size and species trait (the maximal\nsize before cell division). It incorporates growth due to resource consumption\nand predation on smaller cells, death due to predation, and a flexible cell\ndivision process. We give analytic solutions at steady state for both the\nwithin-species size distributions and the relative abundances across species.\n", "  Context: Some stellar objects exhibit very narrow spectral lines in the\nvisible range additional to their blackbody radiation. Natural lasing has been\nsuggested as a mechanism to explain narrow lines in Wolf-Rayet stars. However,\nthe spectral resolution of conventional astronomical spectrographs is still\nabout two orders of magnitude too low to test this hypothesis. Aims: We want to\nresolve the linewidth of narrow spectral emissions in starlight. Methods: A\ncombination of spectral filtering with single-photon-level temporal correlation\nmeasurements breaks the resolution limit of wavelength-dispersing spectrographs\nby moving the linewidth measurement into the time domain. Results: We\ndemonstrate in a laboratory experiment that temporal intensity interferometry\ncan determine a 20 MHz wide linewidth of Doppler-broadened laser light, and\nidentify a coherent laser light contribution in a blackbody radiation\nbackground.\n", "  A solution of Einstein's vacuum field equations that describes a boosted Kerr\nblack hole relative to an asymptotic Lorentz frame at the future null infinity\nis derived. The solution has three parameters (mass, rotation and boost) and\ncorresponds to the most general configuration that an astrophysical black hole\nmust have; it reduces to the Kerr solution when the boost parameter is zero. In\nthis solution the ergosphere is north-south asymmetric, with dominant lobes in\nthe direction opposite to the boost. However the event horizon, the Cauchy\nhorizon and the ring singularity, which are the core of the black hole\nstructure, do not alter, being independent of the boost parameter. Possible\nconsequences for astrophysical processes connected with Penrose processes in\nthe asymmetric ergosphere are discussed.\n", "  Well-controlled quantum devices with their increasing system size face a new\nroadblock hindering further development of quantum technologies: The effort of\nquantum tomography---the characterization of processes and states within a\nquantum device---scales unfavorably to the point that state-of-the-art systems\ncan no longer be treated. Quantum compressed sensing mitigates this problem by\nreconstructing the state from an incomplete set of observables. In this work,\nwe present an experimental implementation of compressed tomography of a seven\nqubit system---the largest-scale realization to date---and we introduce new\nnumerical methods in order to scale the reconstruction to this dimension.\nOriginally, compressed sensing has been advocated for density matrices with few\nnon-zero eigenvalues. Here, we argue that the low-rank estimates provided by\ncompressed sensing can be appropriate even in the general case. The reason is\nthat statistical noise often allows only for the leading eigenvectors to be\nreliably reconstructed: We find that the remaining eigenvectors behave in a way\nconsistent with a random matrix model that carries no information about the\ntrue state. We report a reconstruction of quantum states from a topological\ncolor code of seven qubits, prepared in a trapped ion architecture, based on\ntomographically incomplete data involving 127 Pauli basis measurement settings\nonly, repeated 100 times each.\n", "  Randomized benchmarking (RB) is an important protocol for robustly\ncharacterizing the error rates of quantum gates. The technique is typically\napplied to the Clifford gates since they form a group that satisfies a\nconvenient technical condition of forming a unitary 2-design, in addition to\nhaving a tight connection to fault-tolerant quantum computing and an efficient\nclassical simulation. In order to achieve universal quantum computing one must\nadd at least one additional gate such as the T gate (also known as the $\\pi$/8\ngate). Here we propose and analyze a simple variation of the standard\ninterleaved RB protocol that can accurately estimate the average fidelity of\nthe T gate while retaining the many advantages of a unitary 2-design and the\nfidelity guarantees that such a design delivers, as well as the efficient\nclassical simulation property of the Clifford group. Our work complements prior\nmethods that have succeeded in estimating T gate fidelities, but only by\nrelaxing the 2-design constraint and using a more complicated data analysis.\n", "  Innovation diffusion has been studied extensively in a variety of\ndisciplines, including sociology, economics, marketing, ecology, and computer\nscience. Traditional literature on innovation diffusion has been dominated by\nmodels of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling\n(ABM) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and\nenables fine-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic\nnetworks. While most ABM work on innovation diffusion is theoretical,\nempirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding\npolicy decisions. We present a critical review of empirically grounded\nagent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this\nresearch based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting\nthe modeling methodologies in the fields of information and innovation\ndiffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely\nused in the former is a promising paradigm for calibration of agent-based\nmodels for innovation diffusion. Although many advances have been made to\nstandardize ABM methodology, we identify four major issues in model calibration\nand validation, and suggest potential solutions.\n", "  The periodic $Z_n$-Belavin model on a lattice with an arbitrary number of\nsites $N$ is studied via the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz method (ODBA). The\neigenvalues of the corresponding transfer matrix are given in terms of an\nunified inhomogeneous $T-Q$ relation. In the special case of $N=nl$ with $l$\nbeing also a positive integer, the resulting $T-Q$ relation recovers the\nhomogeneous one previously obtained via algebraic Bethe Ansatz.\n", "  The surface code is currently the leading proposal to achieve fault-tolerant\nquantum computation. Among its strengths are the plethora of known ways in\nwhich fault-tolerant Clifford operations can be performed, namely, by deforming\nthe topology of the surface, by the fusion and splitting of codes and even by\nbraiding engineered Majorana modes using twist defects. Here we present a\nunified framework to describe these methods, which can be used to better\ncompare different schemes, and to facilitate the design of hybrid schemes. Our\nunification includes the identification of twist defects with the corners of\nthe planar code. This identification enables us to perform single-qubit\nClifford gates by exchanging the corners of the planar code via code\ndeformation. We analyse ways in which different schemes can be combined, and\npropose a new logical encoding. We also show how all of the Clifford gates can\nbe implemented with the planar code without loss of distance using code\ndeformations, thus offering an attractive alternative to ancilla-mediated\nschemes to complete the Clifford group with lattice surgery.\n", "  We consider the many-body dynamics of fermions with Coulomb interaction in a\nmean-field scaling limit where the kinetic and potential energy are of the same\norder for large particle numbers. In the considered limit the spatial variation\nof the mean-field is small. We prove two results about this scaling limit.\nFirst, due to the small variation, i.e., small forces, we show that the\nmany-body dynamics can be approximated by the free dynamics with an appropriate\nphase factor with the conjectured optimal error term. Second, we show that the\nHartree dynamics gives a better approximation with a smaller error term. In\nthis sense, assuming that the error term in the first result is optimal, we\nderive the Hartree equations from the many-body dynamics with Coulomb\ninteraction in a mean-field scaling limit.\n", "  Filling-enforced Dirac semimetals, or those required at specific fillings by\nthe combination of crystalline and time-reversal symmetries, have been proposed\nand discovered in numerous materials. However, Dirac points in these materials\nare not generally robust against breaking or modifying time-reversal symmetry.\nWe present a new class of two-dimensional Dirac semimetal protected by the\ncombination of crystal symmetries and a special, antiferromagnetic\ntime-reversal symmetry. Systems in this class of magnetic layer groups, while\nhaving broken time-reversal symmetry, still respect the operation of\ntime-reversal followed by a half-lattice translation. In contrast to 2D\ntime-reversal-symmetric Dirac semimetal phases, this magnetic Dirac phase is\ncapable of hosting just a single isolated Dirac point at the Fermi level, and\nthat Dirac point can be stabilized solely by symmorphic crystal symmetries. We\nfind that this Dirac point represents a new quantum critical point, and lives\nat the boundary between Chern insulating, antiferromagnetic topological\ncrystalline insulating, and trivial insulating phases. We present density\nfunctional theoretic calculations which demonstrate the presence of this 2D\nmagnetic Dirac semimetallic phase in FeSe monolayers and discuss the\nimplications for engineering quantum phase transitions in these materials.\n", "  We provide a detailed study of the interplay between the different\ninteractions which appear in the Brownian motion of a micronsized sphere\nimmersed in a viscoelastic fluid measured with optical trapping interferometry.\nTo explore a wide range of viscous, elastic and optical forces, we analyze two\ndifferent viscoelastic solutions at various concentrations, which provide a\ndynamic polymeric structure surrounding the Brownian sphere. Our experiments\nshow that, depending of the fluid, optical forces, even if small, slightly\nmodify the complex modulus at low frequencies. Based on our findings, we\npropose an alternative methodology to calibrate this kind of experimental\nset-up when non-Newtonian fluids are used. Understanding the influence of the\noptical potential is essential for a correct interpretation of the mechanical\nproperties obtained by optically-trapped probe-based studies of biomaterials\nand living matter.\n", "  With the aim of investigating the relation between gravity and non-locality\nat the classical level, we study a bilocal scalar field model. Bilocality\nintroduces new (internal) degrees of freedom that seem to reproduce gravity. We\nshow that the equations of motion of the massless branch of the free bilocal\nmodel match those of linearized gravity. We also discuss higher orders of\nperturbation theory, where there is self-interaction in both gravity and the\nbilocal field sectors.\n", "  A study of the dynamics of the positive charges in liquid argon has been\ncarried out in the context of the future massive time projection chambers\nproposed for dark matter and neutrino physics. Given their small mobility\ncoefficient in liquid argon, the ions spend a considerably longer time in the\nactive volume with respect to the electrons. The positive charge density can be\nadditionally increased by the injection, in the liquid volume, of the ions\nproduced by the electron multiplying devices located in gas argon. The impact\nof the ion current on the uniformity of the field has been evaluated as well as\nthe probability of the charge signal quenching due to the electron-ion\nrecombination along the drift. The study results show some potential concerns\nfor massive detectors with drift of many meters operated on surface.\n", "  We obtain an explicit characterization of linear maps, in particular, quantum\nchannels, which are covariant with respect to an irreducible representation\n($U$) of a finite group ($G$), whenever $U \\otimes U^c$ is simply reducible\n(with $U^c$ being the contragradient representation). Using the theory of group\nrepresentations, we obtain the spectral decomposition of any such linear map.\nThe eigenvalues and orthogonal projections arising in this decomposition are\nexpressed entirely in terms of representation characteristics of the group $G$.\nThis in turn yields necessary and sufficient conditions on the eigenvalues of\nany such linear map for it to be a quantum channel. We also obtain a wide class\nof quantum channels which are irreducibly covariant by construction. For\ntwo-dimensional irrreducible representations of the symmetric group $S(3)$, and\nthe quaternion group $Q$, we also characterize quantum channels which are both\nirreducibly covariant and entanglement breaking.\n", "  So-called \"twisted\" black holes have recently been proposed by Zhang\n(1609.09721 [gr-qc]), and further considered by Chen and Jing (1610.00886\n[gr-qc]), and more recently by Ong (1610.05757 [gr-qc]). While these spacetimes\nare certainly Ricci-flat, and so mathematically satisfy the vacuum Einstein\nequations, they are also merely minor variants on Taub--NUT spacetimes.\nConsequently they exhibit several unphysical features that make them quite\nunreasonable as realistic astrophysical objects. Specifically, these \"twisted\"\nblack holes are not (globally) asymptotically flat. Furthermore, they contain\nclosed timelike curves that are not hidden behind any event horizon --- the\nmost obvious of these closed timelike curves are small azimuthal circles around\nthe rotation axis, but the effect is more general. The entire region outside\nthe horizon is infested with closed timelike curves.\n", "  We apply the density matrix expansion (DME) at Hartree-Fock level with\nlong-range chiral effective field theory interactions defined in coordinate\nspace up to next-to-next-to-leading order. We consider chiral potentials both\nwith and without explicit Delta isobars. The challenging algebra associated\nwith applying the DME to three-nucleon forces is tamed using a new organization\nscheme, which will also facilitate generalizations. We include local regulators\non the interactions to mitigate the effects of singular potentials on the DME\ncouplings and simplify the optimization of generalized Skyrme-like functionals.\n", "  Remote and in-situ observations strongly imply that the slow solar wind\nconsists of plasma from the hot, closed-field corona that is released onto open\nmagnetic field lines. The Separatrix Web (S-Web) theory for the slow wind\nproposes that photospheric motions, at the scale of supergranules, are\nresponsible for generating dynamics at coronal-hole boundaries, which result in\nthe closed plasma release. We use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D\nMHD) simulations to determine the effect of photospheric flows on the open and\nclosed magnetic flux of a model corona with a dipole magnetic field and an\nisothermal solar wind. A rotational surface motion is used to approximate\nphotospheric supergranular driving and is applied at the boundary between the\ncoronal hole and helmet streamer. The resulting dynamics consist primarily of\nprolific and efficient interchange reconnection between open and closed flux.\nMagnetic flux near the coronal-hole boundary experiences multiple interchange\nevents, with some flux interchanging over fifty times in one day. Additionally,\nwe find that the interchange reconnection occurs all along the coronal-hole\nboundary, even producing a lasting change in magnetic-field connectivity in\nregions that were not driven by the applied motions. Our results show that\nthese dynamics should be ubiquitous in the Sun and heliosphere. We discuss the\nimplications of our simulations for understanding the observed properties of\nthe slow solar wind, with particular focus on the global-scale consequences of\ninterchange reconnection.\n", "  Computational neuroscience models have been used for understanding neural\ndynamics in the brain and how they may be altered when physiological or other\nconditions change. We review and develop a data-driven approach to neuroimaging\ndata called the energy landscape analysis. The methods are rooted in\nstatistical physics theory, in particular the Ising model, also known as the\n(pairwise) maximum entropy model and Boltzmann machine. The methods have been\napplied to fitting electrophysiological data in neuroscience for a decade, but\ntheir use in neuroimaging data is still in its infancy. We first review the\nmethods and discuss some algorithms and technical aspects. Then, we apply the\nmethods to functional magnetic resonance imaging data recorded from healthy\nindividuals to inspect the relationship between the accuracy of fitting, the\nsize of the brain system to be analyzed, and the data length.\n", "  The neutrino and Higgs sectors in the $\\mbox{SU(2)}_1 \\times \\mbox{SU(2)}_2\n\\times \\mbox{U(1)}_Y $ model with lepton-flavor non-universality are discussed.\nWe show that active neutrinos can get Majorana masses from radiative\ncorrections, after adding only new singly charged Higgs bosons. The mechanism\nfor generation of neutrino masses is the same as in the Zee models. This also\ngives a hint to solving the dark matter problem based on similar ways discussed\nrecently in many radiative neutrino mass models with dark matter. Except the\nactive neutrinos, the appearance of singly charged Higgs bosons and dark matter\ndoes not affect significantly the physical spectrum of all particles in the\noriginal model. We indicate this point by investigating the Higgs sector in\nboth cases before and after singly charged scalars are added into it. Many\ninteresting properties of physical Higgs bosons, which were not shown\npreviously, are explored. In particular, the mass matrices of charged and\nCP-odd Higgs fields are proportional to the coefficient of triple Higgs\ncoupling $\\mu$. The mass eigenstates and eigenvalues in the CP-even Higgs\nsector are also presented. All couplings of the SM-like Higgs boson to normal\nfermions and gauge bosons are different from the SM predictions by a factor\n$c_h$, which must satisfy the recent global fit of experimental data, namely\n$0.995<|c_h|<1$. We have analyzed a more general diagonalization of gauge boson\nmass matrices, then we show that the ratio of the tangents of the $W-W'$ and\n$Z-Z'$ mixing angles is exactly the cosine of the Weinberg angle, implying that\nnumber of parameters is reduced by 1. Signals of new physics from decays of new\nheavy fermions and Higgs bosons at LHC and constraints of their masses are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Hydrogen- and methyl-capped polyynes were synthesized by irradiating pure\nliquid toluene with 35 femtosecond, 300 {\\mu}J laser pulses having a central\nwavelength of 800 nm, generated by a regeneratively amplified Ti:sapphire\ntabletop laser at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. Raman spectroscopy was used to\nconfirm the presence of polyynes in the irradiated samples while\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography was used to separate hydrogen-capped\npolyynes up to C18H2 and methyl-capped polyynes up to HC14CH3. These represent\nthe first such methyl-capped polyynes and the longest hydrogen capped chains\nsynthesized to date by the ultrafast laser based method. Furthermore our\nresults show that choice of the starting solvent molecule directly influences\nthe end caps of the polyynes which can be produced.\n", "  We study the prospects of measuring the CP property of the Higgs ($h$)\ncoupling to tau leptons using the vector boson fusion (VBF) production mode at\nthe high-luminosity LHC. Utilizing the previously proposed angle between the\nplanes spanned by the momentum vectors of the $(\\pi^+\\pi^0)$ and $(\\pi^-\n\\pi^0)$ pairs originating in $\\tau^\\pm$ decays as the CP-odd observable, we\nperform a detailed Monte Carlo analysis, taking into account the relevant\nstandard model backgrounds, as well as detector resolution effects. We find\nthat excluding a pure CP-odd coupling hypothesis requires $\\mathcal{O}(400\n{~\\rm fb}^{-1})$ luminosity at the 14 TeV LHC, and values of the CP-mixing\nangle larger than about $25^\\circ$ can be excluded at $95\\%$ confidence level\nusing $3 {~\\rm ab}^{-1}$ data. It is observed that the uncertainty in the\nangular resolution of the neutral pion momenta does not constitute a\nsignificant hurdle. Achieving a signal to background ratio ($S/B$) close to\none, while keeping a high enough signal yield required to study the angular\ndistributions selects out VBF as a promising mode to probe the CP nature of the\n$h\\tau\\tau$ coupling, with gluon fusion suffering from a low $S/B$, and the\n$W^\\pm h/Zh$ mode (with leptonically decaying $W^\\pm /Z$) having a much smaller\nsignal rate.\n", "  We propose an approximate approach for studying the relativistic regime of\nstellar tidal disruptions by rotating massive black holes. It combines an exact\nrelativistic description of the hydrodynamical evolution of a test fluid in a\nfixed curved spacetime with a Newtonian treatment of the fluid's self-gravity.\nExplicit expressions for the equations of motion are derived for Kerr spacetime\nusing two different coordinate systems. We implement the new methodology within\nan existing Newtonian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code and show that\nincluding the additional physics involves very little extra computational cost.\nWe carefully explore the validity of the novel approach by first testing its\nability to recover geodesic motion, and then by comparing the outcome of tidal\ndisruption simulations against previous relativistic studies. We further\ncompare simulations in Boyer--Lindquist and Kerr--Schild coordinates and\nconclude that our approach allows accurate simulation even of tidal disruption\nevents where the star penetrates deeply inside the tidal radius of a rotating\nblack hole. Finally, we use the new method to study the effect of the black\nhole spin on the morphology and fallback rate of the debris streams resulting\nfrom tidal disruptions, finding that while the spin has little effect on the\nfallback rate, it does imprint heavily on the stream morphology, and can even\nbe a determining factor in the survival or disruption of the star itself. Our\nmethodology is discussed in detail as a reference for future astrophysical\napplications.\n", "  The $s$-process in massive stars produces the weak component of the\n$s$-process (nuclei up to $A \\sim 90$), in amounts that match solar abundances.\nFor heavier isotopes, such as barium, production through neutron capture is\nsignificantly enhanced in very metal-poor stars with fast rotation. However,\ndetailed theoretical predictions for the resulting final $s$-process abundances\nhave important uncertainties caused both by the underlying uncertainties in the\nnuclear physics (principally neutron capture reaction and $\\beta$-decay rates)\nas well as by the stellar evolution modeling. In this work, we investigated the\nimpact of nuclear-physics uncertainties relevant to the $s$-process in massive\nstars. Using a Monte-Carlo based approach, we performed extensive nuclear\nreaction network calculations that include newly evaluated upper and lower\nlimits for the individual temperature dependent reaction rates. We found that\nmost of the uncertainty in the final abundances is caused by uncertainties in\nthe neutron capture rates, while $\\beta$-decay rate uncertainties affect only a\nfew nuclei near $s$-process branchings. The $s$-process in rotating metal-poor\nstars shows quantitatively different uncertainties and key reactions, although\nthe qualitative characteristics are similar. We confirmed that our results do\nnot significantly change at different metallicities for fast rotating massive\nstars in the very low metallicity regime. We highlight which of the identified\nkey reactions are realistic candidates for improved measurement by future\nexperiments.\n", "  We report the development of indium oxide (In2O3) transistors via a single\nstep laser-induced photochemical conversion process of a sol-gel metal oxide\nprecursor. Through careful optimization of the laser annealing conditions we\ndemonstrated successful conversion of the precursor to In2O3 and its subsequent\nimplementation in n-channel transistors with electron mobility up to 13 cm2/Vs.\nImportantly, the process does not require thermal annealing making it\ncompatible with temperature sensitive materials such as plastic. On the other\nhand, the spatial conversion/densification of the sol-gel layer eliminates\nadditional process steps associated with semiconductor patterning and hence\nsignificantly reduces fabrication complexity and cost. Our work demonstrates\nunambiguously that laser-induced photochemical conversion of sol-gel metal\noxide precursors can be rapid and compatible with large-area electronics\nmanufacturing.\n", "  Next generation radio-interferometers, like the Square Kilometre Array, will\nacquire tremendous amounts of data with the goal of improving the size and\nsensitivity of the reconstructed images by orders of magnitude. The efficient\nprocessing of large-scale data sets is of great importance. We propose an\nacceleration strategy for a recently proposed primal-dual distributed\nalgorithm. A preconditioning approach can incorporate into the algorithmic\nstructure both the sampling density of the measured visibilities and the noise\nstatistics. Using the sampling density information greatly accelerates the\nconvergence speed, especially for highly non-uniform sampling patterns, while\nrelying on the correct noise statistics optimises the sensitivity of the\nreconstruction. In connection to CLEAN, our approach can be seen as including\nin the same algorithmic structure both natural and uniform weighting, thereby\nsimultaneously optimising both the resolution and the sensitivity. The method\nrelies on a new non-Euclidean proximity operator for the data fidelity term,\nthat generalises the projection onto the $\\ell_2$ ball where the noise lives\nfor naturally weighted data, to the projection onto a generalised ellipsoid\nincorporating sampling density information through uniform weighting.\nImportantly, this non-Euclidean modification is only an acceleration strategy\nto solve the convex imaging problem with data fidelity dictated only by noise\nstatistics. We showcase through simulations with realistic sampling patterns\nthe acceleration obtained using the preconditioning. We also investigate the\nalgorithm performance for the reconstruction of the 3C129 radio galaxy from\nreal visibilities and compare with multi-scale CLEAN, showing better\nsensitivity and resolution. Our MATLAB code is available online on GitHub.\n", "  In this work, we study the tradeoffs between the error probabilities of\nclassical-quantum channels and the blocklength $n$ when the transmission rates\napproach the channel capacity at a rate slower than $1/\\sqrt{n}$, a research\ntopic known as moderate deviation analysis. We show that the optimal error\nprobability vanishes under this rate convergence. Our main technical\ncontributions are a tight quantum sphere-packing bound, obtained via Chaganty\nand Sethuraman's concentration inequality in strong large deviation theory, and\nasymptotic expansions of error-exponent functions. Moderate deviation analysis\nfor quantum hypothesis testing is also established. The converse directly\nfollows from our channel coding result, while the achievability relies on a\nmartingale inequality.\n", "  We perform a series of dimensional reductions of the 6d, $\\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$\nSCFT on $S^2\\times\\Sigma\\times I\\times S^1$ down to 2d on $\\Sigma$. The\nreductions are performed in three steps: (i) a reduction on $S^1$ (accompanied\nby a topological twist along $\\Sigma$) leading to a supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory on $S^2\\times\\Sigma\\times I$, (ii) a further reduction on $S^2$\nresulting in a complex Chern--Simons theory defined on $\\Sigma\\times I$, with\nthe real part of the complex Chern-Simons level being zero, and the imaginary\npart being proportional to the ratio of the radii of $S^2$ and $S^1$, and (iii)\na final reduction to the boundary modes of complex Chern--Simons theory with\nthe Nahm pole boundary condition at both ends of the interval $I$, which gives\nrise to a complex Toda CFT on the Riemann surface $\\Sigma$. As the reduction of\nthe 6d theory on $\\Sigma$ would give rise to an $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric\ntheory on $S^2\\times I\\times S^1$, our results imply a 4d-2d duality between\nfour-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric theory with boundary and\ntwo-dimensional complex Toda theory.\n", "  The minimum action method (MAM) is to calculate the most probable transition\npath in randomly perturbed stochastic dynamics, based on the idea of action\nminimization in the path space. The accuracy of the numerical path between\ndifferent metastable states usually suffers from the \"clustering problem\" near\nfixed points. The adaptive minimum action method (aMAM) solves this problem by\nrelocating image points equally along arc-length with the help of moving mesh\nstrategy. However, when the time interval is large, the images on the path may\nstill be locally trapped around the transition state in a tangle, due to the\nsingularity of the relationship between arc-length and time at the transition\nstate. Additionally, in most non-gradient dynamics, the tangent direction of\nthe path is not continuous at the transition state so that a geometric corner\nforms, which brings extra challenges for the aMAM. In this note, we improve the\naMAM by proposing a better monitor function that does not contain the numerical\napproximation of derivatives, and taking use of a generalized scheme of the\nEuler-Lagrange equation to solve the minimization problem, so that both the\npath-tangling problem and the non-smoothness in parametrizing the curve do not\nexist. To further improve the accuracy, we apply the Weighted Essentially\nnon-oscillatory (WENO) method for the interpolation to achieve better\nperformance. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the advantages of\nour new method.\n", "  We present experimental measurements of the steady-state ion number in a\nlinear Paul trap (LPT) as a function of the ion-loading rate. These\nmeasurements, taken with (a) constant Paul trap stability parameter $q$, (b)\nconstant radio-frequency (rf) amplitude, or (c) constant rf frequency, show\nnonlinear behavior. At the loading rates achieved in this experiment, a plot of\nthe steady-state ion number as a function of loading rate has two regions: a\nmonotonic rise (region I) followed by a plateau (region II). Also described are\nsimulations and analytical theory which match the experimental results. Region\nI is caused by rf heating and is fundamentally due to the time dependence of\nthe rf Paul-trap forces. We show that the time-independent pseudopotential,\nfrequently used in the analytical investigation of trapping experiments, cannot\nexplain region I, but explains the plateau in region II and can be used to\npredict the steady-state ion number in that region. An important feature of our\nexperimental LPT is the existence of a radial cut-off $\\hat R_{\\rm cut}$ that\nlimits the ion capacity of our LPT and features prominently in the analytical\nand numerical analysis of our LPT-loading results. We explain the dynamical\norigin of $\\hat R_{\\rm cut}$ and relate it to the chaos border of the fractal\nof non-escaping trajectories in our LPT. We also present an improved model of\nLPT ion-loading as a function of time.\n", "  We consider the general problem of quenching an interacting Bose gas from the\nnoninteracting regime to the strong repulsive case described by the\nTonks-Girardeau limit, with the initial state being a gaussian ensemble for the\nbosons. A generic multi-point correlation function in the steady state can be\nfully described in terms of a Fredholm-like determinant suitable both for a\nnumerical study and for an analytical study in certain limiting cases. Finally,\nwe extend the study to the presence of a smooth confining potential showing\nthat, in the thermodynamic limit, the time evolution of the two-point function\ncan be mapped to a classical problem in a properly defined phase-space.\n", "  The combination of the surface science techniques (STM, XPS, ARPES) and\ndensity-functional theory calculations was used to study the decoupling of\ngraphene from Ni(111) by oxygen intercalation. The formation of the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO layer at the interface between graphene and\nferromagnetic (FM) Ni is found, where graphene protects the underlying AFM/FM\nsandwich system. It is found that graphene is fully decoupled in this system\nand strongly $p$-doped via charge transfer with a position of the Dirac point\nof $(0.69\\pm0.02)$ eV above the Fermi level. Our theoretical analysis confirms\nall experimental findings, addressing also the interface properties between\ngraphene and AFM NiO.\n", "  Canonical quantization relies on Cartesian, canonical, phase-space\ncoordinates to promote to Hermitian operators, which also become the principal\ningredients in the quantum Hamiltonian. While generally appropriate, this\nprocedure can also fail, e.g., for covariant, quartic, scalar fields in\nfive-and-more spacetime dimensions (and possibly four spacetime dimensions as\nwell), which become trivial; such failures are normally blamed on the `problem'\nrather than on the 'quantization procedure'. In Enhanced Quantization the\nassociation of $c$-numbers to $q$-numbers is chosen very differently such that:\n(i) there is no need to seek classical, Cartesian, phase-space coordinates;\n(ii) every classical, contact transformation is applicable and no change of the\nquantum operators arises; (iii) a new understanding of the importance of\n'Cartesian coordinates' is established; and (iv) although discussed elsewhere\nin detail, the procedures of enhanced quantization offer fully acceptable\nsolutions yielding non-trivial results for quartic scalar fields in\nfour-and-more spacetime dimensions. In early sections, this paper offers a\nwide-audience approach to the basic principles of Enhanced Quantization using\nsimple examples; later, several significant examples are cited for a deeper\nunderstanding. An historical note concludes the paper.\n", "  Utilizing a combination of low-temperature scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and electronic structure calculations, we\ncharacterize the structural and electronic properties of single atomic\nvacancies within several monolayers of the surface of black phosphorus. We\nillustrate, with experimental analysis and tight-binding calculations, that we\ncan depth profile these vacancies and assign them to specific sublattices\nwithin the unit cell. Measurements reveal that the single vacancies exhibit\nstrongly anisotropic and highly delocalized charge density, laterally extended\nup to 20 atomic unit cells. The vacancies are then studied with STS, which\nreveals in-gap resonance states near the valence band edge and a strong\np-doping of the bulk black phosphorus crystal. Finally, quasiparticle\ninterference generated near these vacancies enables the direct visualization of\nthe anisotropic band structure of black phosphorus.\n", "  Unlike the hole-doped cuprates, both nodal and nodeless superconductivity\n(SC) are observed in the electron-doped cuprates. To understand these two types\nof SC states, we propose a unified theory by considering the two-dimensional\nt-J model in proximity to an antiferromagnetic (AF) long-range ordering state.\nWithin the slave-boson mean-field approximation, the d-wave pairing symmetry is\nstill the most energetically favorable even in the presence of the external AF\nfield. In the nodal phase, it is found that the nodes carry vorticity and are\nprotected by the adjoint symmetry of time-reversal and one unit lattice\ntranslation. Robust edge modes are obtained, suggesting the nodal d-wave SC\nbeing a topological weak-pairing phase. As decreasing the doping concentration\nor increasing the AF field, the nodes with opposite vorticity annihilate and\nthe nodeless strong-pairing phase emerges. The topological phase transition is\ncharacterized by a critical point with anisotropic Bogoliubov quasiparticles,\nand a universal understanding is thus established for all electron-doped\ncuprates.\n", "  We explore 1d vortex dynamics of 3d supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, as\ninferred from factorization of exact partition functions. Under Seiberg-like\ndualities, the 3d partition function must remain invariant, yet it is not a\npriori clear what should happen to the vortex dynamics. We observe that the 1d\nquivers for the vortices remain the same, and the net effect of the 3d duality\nmap manifests as 1d Wall-Crossing phenomenon; Although the vortex number can\nshift along such duality maps, the ranks of the 1d quiver theory are\nunaffected, leading to a notion of fundamental vortices as basic building\nblocks for topological sectors. For Aharony-type duality, in particular, where\none must supply extra chiral fields to couple with monopole operators on the\ndual side, 1d wall-crossings of an infinite number of vortex quiver theories\nare neatly and collectively encoded by 3d determinant of such extra chiral\nfields. As such, 1d wall-crossing of the vortex theory encodes the\nparticle-vortex duality embedded in the 3d Seiberg-like duality. For $\\mathcal\nN = 4$, the D-brane picture is used to motivate this 3d/1d connection, while,\nfor $\\mathcal N = 2$, this 3d/1d connection is used to fine-tune otherwise\nambiguous vortex dynamics. We also prove some identities of 3d supersymmetric\npartition functions for the Aharony duality using this vortex wall-crossing\ninterpretation.\n", "  Optomechanical systems driven by an effective blue detuned laser can exhibit\nself-sustained oscillations of the mechanical oscillator. These\nself-oscillations are a prerequisite for the observation of synchronization.\nHere, we study the synchronization of the mechanical oscillations to an\nexternal reference drive. We study two cases of reference drives: (1) An\nadditional laser applied to the optical cavity; (2) A mechanical drive applied\ndirectly to the mechanical oscillator. Starting from a master equation\ndescription, we derive a microscopic Adler equation for both cases, valid in\nthe classical regime in which the quantum shot noise of the mechanical\nself-oscillator does not play a role. Furthermore, we numerically show that, in\nboth cases, synchronization arises also in the quantum regime. The\noptomechanical system is therefore a good candidate for the study of quantum\nsynchronization.\n", "  We study static and radially symmetric black holes in the multi-fractional\ntheories of gravity with $q$-derivatives and with weighted derivatives,\nframeworks where the spacetime dimension varies with the probed scale and\ngeometry is characterized by at least one fundamental length $\\ell_*$. In the\n$q$-derivatives scenario, one finds a tiny shift of the event horizon.\nSchwarzschild black holes can present an additional ring singularity, not\npresent in general relativity, whose radius is proportional to $\\ell_*$. In the\nmulti-fractional theory with weighted derivatives, there is no such\ndeformation, but non-trivial geometric features generate a\ncosmological-constant term, leading to a de Sitter--Schwarzschild black hole.\nFor both scenarios, we compute the Hawking temperature and comment on the\nresulting black hole thermodynamics. In the case with $q$-derivatives, black\nholes can be hotter than usual and possess an additional ring singularity,\nwhile in the case with weighted derivatives they have a de Sitter hair of\npurely geometric origin, which may lead to a solution of the cosmological\nconstant problem similar to that in unimodular gravity. Finally, we compare our\nfindings with other Lorentz-violating models.\n", "  We describe a novel method to measure the absolute orientation of the\npolarization plane of the CMB with arcsecond accuracy, enabling unprecedented\nmeasurements for cosmology and fundamental physics. Existing and planned CMB\npolarization instruments looking for primordial B-mode signals need an\nindependent, experimental method for systematics control on the absolute\npolarization orientation. The lack of such a method limits the accuracy of the\ndetection of inflationary gravitational waves, the constraining power on the\nneutrino sector through measurements of gravitational lensing of the CMB, the\npossibility of detecting Cosmic Birefringence, and the ability to measure\nprimordial magnetic fields. Sky signals used for calibration and direct\nmeasurements of the detector orientation cannot provide an accuracy better than\n1 deg. Self-calibration methods provide better accuracy, but may be affected by\nforeground signals and rely heavily on model assumptions. The POLarization\nOrientation CALibrator for Cosmology, POLOCALC, will dramatically improve\ninstrumental accuracy by means of an artificial calibration source flying on\nballoons and aerial drones. A balloon-borne calibrator will provide far-field\nsource for larger telescopes, while a drone will be used for tests and smaller\npolarimeters. POLOCALC will also allow a unique method to measure the\ntelescopes' polarized beam. It will use microwave emitters between 40 and 150\nGHz coupled to precise polarizing filters. The orientation of the source\npolarization plane will be registered to sky coordinates by star cameras and\ngyroscopes with arcsecond accuracy. This project can become a rung in the\ncalibration ladder for the field: any existing or future CMB polarization\nexperiment observing our polarization calibrator will enable measurements of\nthe polarization angle for each detector with respect to absolute sky\ncoordinates.\n", "  We study effects of tight harmonic-oscillator confinement on the\nelectromagnetic field in a laser cavity by solving the two-dimensional\nLugiato-Lefever (2D LL) equation, taking into account self- focusing or\ndefocusing nonlinearity, losses, pump, and the trapping potential. Tightly\nconfined (quasi-zero-dimensional) optical modes (pixels), produced by this\nmodel, are analyzed by means of the variational approximation, which provides a\nqualitative picture of the ensuing phenomena. This is followed by systematic\nsimulations of the time-dependent 2D LL equation, which reveal the shape,\nstability, and dynamical behavior of the resulting localized patterns. In this\nway, we produce stability diagrams for the expected pixels. Then, we consider\nthe LL model with the vortical pump, showing that it can produce stable pixels\nwith embedded vorticity (vortex solitons) in remarkably broad sta- bility\nareas. Alongside confined vortices with the simple single-ring structure, in\nthe latter case the LL model gives rise to stable multi-ring states, with a\nspiral phase field. In addition to the numeri- cal results, a qualitatively\ncorrect description of the vortex solitons is provided by the Thomas-Fermi\napproximation.\n", "  The range of currently proposed active galactic nucleus (AGN) far-infrared\ntemplates results in uncertainties in retrieving host galaxy information from\ninfrared observations and also undermines constraints on the outer part of the\nAGN torus. We discuss how to test and reconcile these templates. Physically,\nthe fraction of the intrinsic AGN IR-processed luminosity compared with that\nfrom the central engine should be consistent with the dust-covering factor. In\naddition, besides reproducing the composite spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of quasars, a correct AGN IR template combined with an accurate library\nof star-forming galaxy templates should be able to reproduce the IR properties\nof the host galaxies, such as the luminosity-dependent SED shapes and aromatic\nfeature strengths. We develop tests based on these expected behaviors and find\nthat the shape of the AGN intrinsic far-IR emission drops off rapidly starting\nat $\\sim20~\\mu$m and can be matched by an Elvis et al. (1994)-like template\nwith minor modification. Despite the variations in the near- to mid-IR bands,\nAGNs in quasars and Seyfert galaxies have remarkably similar intrinsic far-IR\nSEDs at $\\lambda \\sim 20$-$100~\\mu$ m, suggesting similar emission character of\nthe outermost region of the circumnuclear torus. The variations of the\nintrinsic AGN IR SEDs among the type-1 quasar population can be explained by\nthe changing relative strengths of four major dust components with similar\ncharacteristic temperatures, and there is evidence for compact AGN-heated dusty\nstructures at sub-kpc scales in the far-IR.\n", "  A three-dimensional spin current solver based on a generalised spin\ndrift-diffusion description, including the spin Hall effect, is integrated with\na magnetisation dynamics solver. The resulting model is shown to simultaneously\nreproduce the spin-orbit torques generated using the spin Hall effect, spin\npumping torques generated by magnetisation dynamics in multilayers, as well as\nthe spin transfer torques acting on magnetisation regions with spatial\ngradients, whilst field-like and spin-like torques are reproduced in a spin\nvalve geometry. Two approaches to modelling interfaces are analysed, one based\non the spin mixing conductance and the other based on continuity of spin\ncurrents where the spin dephasing length governs the absorption of transverse\nspin components. In both cases analytical formulas are derived for the\nspin-orbit torques in a heavy metal / ferromagnet bilayer geometry, showing in\ngeneral both field-like and damping-like torques are generated. The limitations\nof the analytical approach are discussed, showing that even in a simple bilayer\ngeometry, due to the non-uniformity of the spin currents, a full\nthree-dimensional treatment is required. Finally the model is applied to the\nquantitative analysis of the spin Hall angle in Pt by reproducing published\nexperimental data on the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth in the bilayer\ngeometry.\n", "  Recent studies have demonstrated that defocusing cubic nonlinearity with\nlocal strength growing from the center to the periphery faster than $r^{D}$, in\nspace of dimension $D$ with radial coordinate $r$, supports a vast variety of\nrobust bright solitons. In the framework of the same model, but with a weaker\nspatial-growth rate, $\\sim r^{\\alpha }$ with $\\alpha \\leq D$, we here test the\npossibility to create stable\\textit{\\ localized continuous waves} (LCWs) in\none- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) geometries, \\textit{% localized dark\nsolitons} (LDSs) in 1D, and \\textit{localized dark vortices} (LDVs) in 2D,\nwhich are all realized as loosely confined states with a divergent norm.\nAsymptotic tails of the solutions, which determine the divergence of the norm,\nare constructed in a universal analytical form by means of the Thomas-Fermi\napproximation (TFA). Global approximations for the LCWs, LDSs, and LDVs are\nconstructed on the basis of interpolations between analytical approximations\navailable far from (TFA) and close to the center. In particular, the\ninterpolations for the 1D LDS, as well as for the 2D LDVs, are based on a\n\\textquotedblleft deformed-tanh\" expression, which is suggested by the usual 1D\ndark-soliton solution. In addition to the 1D fundamental LDSs with the single\nnotch, and 2D vortices with $S=1$, higher-order LDSs with multiple notches are\nfound too, as well as double LDVs, with $S=2$. Stability regions for the modes\nunder the consideration are identified by means of systematic simulations, the\nLCWs being completely stable in 1D and 2D, as they are ground states in the\ncorresponding settings. Basic evolution scenarios are identified for those\nvortices which are unstable. The settings considered in this work may be\nimplemented in nonlinear optics and in Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  A method is developed for generating pseudopotentials for use in\ncorrelated-electron calculations. The paradigms of shape and energy consistency\nare combined and defined in terms of correlated-electron wave-functions. The\nresulting energy consistent correlated electron pseudopotentials (eCEPPs) are\nconstructed for H, Li--F, Sc--Fe, and Cu. Their accuracy is quantified by\ncomparing the relaxed molecular geometries and dissociation energies they\nprovide with all electron results, with all quantities evaluated using coupled\ncluster singles doubles and triples calculations. Errors inherent in the\npseudopotentials are also compared with those arising from a number of\napproximations commonly used with pseudopotentials. The eCEPPs provide a\nsignificant improvement in optimised geometries and dissociation energies for\nsmall molecules, with errors for the latter being an order-of-magnitude smaller\nthan for Hartree-Fock-based pseudopotentials available in the literature.\nGaussian basis sets are optimised for use with these pseudopotentials.\n", "  The nuclear spin relaxation time $T_1$ is calculated taking account of the\ncontributions from orbital currents of Dirac electrons. We consider a simple\nmodel of non-interacting Dirac electron gas in the three-dimensional bulk\nsystem. The obtained result shows $T^3$ dependence of $1/T_1$ at temperatures\n$T$ above the energy gap. This temperature dependence agrees qualitatively with\nthe recent $\\beta$-NMR experiment on the bulk of the topological insulator\n$\\mathrm{Bi}_{0.9}\\mathrm{Sb}_{0.1}$.\n", "  In this Letter, we demonstrate that short-period stars orbiting around the\nsupermassive black hole in our Galactic Center can successfully be used to\nprobe the gravitational theory in a strong regime. We use 19 years of\nobservations of the two best measured short-period stars orbiting our Galactic\nCenter to constrain a hypothetical fifth force that arises in various scenarios\nmotivated by the development of a unification theory or in some models of dark\nmatter and dark energy. No deviation from General Relativity is reported and\nthe fifth force strength is restricted to an upper 95% confidence limit of\n$\\left|\\alpha\\right| < 0.016$ at a length scale of $\\lambda=$ 150 astronomical\nunits. We also derive a 95% confidence upper limit on a linear drift of the\nargument of periastron of the short-period star S0-2 of $\\left|\\dot\n\\omega_\\textrm{S0-2} \\right|< 1.6 \\times 10^{-3}$ rad/yr, which can be used to\nconstrain various gravitational and astrophysical theories. This analysis\nprovides the first fully self-consistent test of the gravitational theory using\norbital dynamic in a strong gravitational regime, that of a supermassive black\nhole. A sensitivity analysis for future measurements is also presented.\n", "  Strong electron cooling on the neutral gas in cometary comae has been\npredicted for a long time, but actual measurements of low electron temperature\nare scarce. We present in situ measurements of plasma density, electron\ntemperature and spacecraft potential by the Rosetta Langmuir probe instrument,\nLAP. Data acquired within a few hundred km from the nucleus are dominated by a\nwarm component with electron temperature typically 5--10 eV at all heliocentric\ndistances covered (1.25 to 3.83 AU). A cold component, with temperature no\nhigher than about 0.1 eV, appears in the data as short (few to few tens of\nseconds) pulses of high probe current, indicating local enhancement of plasma\ndensity as well as a decrease in electron temperature. These pulses first\nappeared around 3 AU and were seen for longer periods close to perihelion. The\ngeneral pattern of pulse appearance follows that of neutral gas and plasma\ndensity. We have not identified any periods with only cold electrons present.\nThe electron flux to Rosetta was always dominated by higher energies, driving\nthe spacecraft potential to order -10 V. The warm (5--10 eV) electron\npopulation is interpreted as electrons retaining the energy they obtained when\nreleased in the ionisation process. The sometimes observed cold populations\nwith electron temperatures below 0.1 eV verify collisional cooling in the coma.\nThe cold electrons were only observed together with the warm population. The\ngeneral appearance of the cold population appears to be consistent with a\nHaser-like model, implicitly supporting also the coupling of ions to the\nneutral gas. The expanding cold plasma is unstable, forming filaments that we\nobserve as pulses.\n", "  We have researched the motion of gas in the subnanochannel with functional\nsurface which wettability has a gradient for the fluid by using molecular\ndynamics simulation. The results show that the gas is driven to flow under a\nsingle heat source and without any other work or energy applied to the system.\nThe driving source is owed to the potential gradient of the functional face\nwhich keeps the fluid running in the subnanochannel. The width of the channel\nand the pressure of the reservoir has a significant influence on the flow\nvelocity, which, respectively, has an optimal value for the maximum velocity.\nThe flow velocity grows with the increasing temperature.\n", "  The site-reduction of U(1) lattice gauge theory along the spatial directions\nis used to model the monopole dynamics. The reduced theory is that of the\nangle-valued coordinates on the discrete worldline. Below the critical coupling\n$g_{c}=1.125$ and temperature $T_c=0.335$ the model exhibits a first order\nphase transition. It is argued that the phase structure matches with the\nproposed role for magnetic monopoles in the confinement mechanism based on the\ndual Meissner effect.\n", "  The steady-state approximation (hereafter abbreviated as SSA) consists in\nsetting $dy/dt=0$, where $y$ denotes the concentration of a short-lived\nintermediate subject to first-order decay with a rate constant $k$. The sole\nreason for enforcing SSA is to convert the rate equation for $y$ into an\nalgebraic equation. The conditions under which SSA becomes trustworthy are now\nwell understood, but a firm grasp of the physical content of the approximation\nrequires more maturity than few teachers, let alone their students, may be\nexpected to possess. Furthermore, there is no simple way to gauge the accuracy\nof the results derived by imposing SSA. The purpose of this note is to\ndemonstrate that a better, but equally simple, approximation results if,\ninstead of setting $dy/dt$ to zero, one substitutes $y(t+\\tau)$ for $y+\\tau\ndy/dt$, where $\\tau=1/k$; SSA is a cruder approximation because it neglects the\nsecond term. For systems modelled as damped harmonic oscillators, the \"reverse\nTaylor approximation\" can be extended by retaining one more term in the Taylor\nexpansion. The utility of the approximation (or its extension) is demonstrated\nby examining the following systems: radioactive equilibria, Brownian motion,\ndynamic response of linear first- and second-order systems.\n", "  In this paper we are concerned with the existence of periodic solutions for\nsemilinear Duffing equations with impulsive effects. Firstly for the autonomous\none, basing on Poincar\\'{e}-Birkhoff twist theorem, we prove the existence of\ninfinitely many periodic solutions. Secondly, as for the nonautonomous case,\nthe impulse brings us great challenges for the study, and there are only\nfinitely many periodic solutions, which is quite different from the\ncorresponding equation without impulses. Here, taking the autonomous one as an\nauxiliary equation, we find the relation between these two equations and then\nobtain the result also by Poincar\\'{e}-Birkhoff twist theorem.\n", "  We present a model to generate power spectrum noise with intensity\nproportional to 1/f as a function of frequency f. The model arises from a\nbroken-symmetry variable which corresponds to absolute pitch, where\nfluctuations occur in an attempt to restore that symmetry, influenced by\ninteractions in the creation of musical melodies.\n", "  The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will perform a two-year\nsurvey of nearly the entire sky, with the main goal of detecting exoplanets\nsmaller than Neptune around bright and nearby stars. There do not appear to be\nany fundamental obstacles to continuing science operations for at least several\nyears after the two-year Primary Mission. To provide a head start to those who\nwill plan and propose for such a mission, we present simulations of exoplanet\ndetections in a third year of TESS operations. Our goal is to provide a helpful\nreference for the exoplanet-related aspects of any Extended Mission, while\nrecognizing this will be only one part of a larger community discussion of the\nscientific goals. We use Monte Carlo simulations to try and anticipate the\nquantities and types of planets that would be detected in each of 6 plausible\nscenarios for a one-year Extended Mission following the two-year Primary\nMission. We find that: (1) there is no sharp fall-off in the planet discovery\nrate in the third year; (2) the quantity of newly detected sub-Neptune radius\nplanets does not depend strongly on the schedule of pointings; (3) an important\nfunction of an Extended Mission would be improving our ability to predict the\ntimes of future transits and occultations of TESS-detected planets.\n", "  We review observations of several classes of neutron-star-powered outflows:\npulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe) inside shell supernova remnants (SNRs), PWNe\ninteracting directly with interstellar medium (ISM), and magnetar-powered\noutflows. We describe radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations of PWNe,\nfocusing first on integrated spectral-energy distributions (SEDs) and global\nspectral properties. High-resolution X-ray imaging of PWNe shows a bewildering\narray of morphologies, with jets, trails, and other structures. Several of the\n23 so far identified magnetars show evidence for continuous or sporadic\nemission of material, sometimes associated with giant flares, and a few\npossible \"magnetar-wind nebulae\" have been recently identified.\n", "  A climate mitigation comprehensive solution is presented through the first\nhigh yield, low energy synthesis of macroscopic length carbon nanotubes (CNT)\nwool from CO2 by molten carbonate electrolysis, suitable for weaving into\ncarbon composites and textiles. Growing CO2 concentrations, the concurrent\nclimate change and species extinction can be addressed if CO2 becomes a sought\nresource rather than a greenhouse pollutant. Inexpensive carbon composites\nformed from carbon wool as a lighter metal, textiles and cement replacement\ncomprise a major market sink to compactly store transformed anthropogenic CO2.\n100x-longer CNTs grow on Monel versus steel. Monel, electrolyte equilibration,\nand a mixed metal nucleation facilitate the synthesis. CO2, the sole reactant\nin this transformation, is directly extractable from dilute (atmospheric) or\nconcentrated sources, and is cost constrained only by the (low) cost of\nelectricity. Today's $100K per ton CNT valuation incentivizes CO2 removal.\n", "  The transverse magnetoresistance of thin films of the Diluted Magnetic\nSemiconductor Zn$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$O:Al on glass was studied for temperatures in\nthe range of 5 to 100 K. Measurements were made on thin films grown by rf\nmagnetron sputtering, with a thickness of approximately 200 nm. ZnO was alloyed\nwith Co to a concentration $x$ of 0.1 and co-doped with a 5.5% wt concentration\nof Al. The electrical resistivity was measured along the sample surface by the\nfour-point probe method with a magnetic field of up to 4 T applied\nperpendicular to the surface of the film. The experimental results of the\nmagnetoresistance have been interpreted by means of a semiclassical model that\ncombines a relaxation-time approximation to describe scattering processes in\nZnO and a phenomenological approach to the spin-disorder scattering due to the\nindirect exchange interaction of the magnetic impurities.\n", "  In a color X-ray camera, spatial resolution is achieved by means of a\npolycapillary optic conducting X-ray photons from small regions on a sample to\ndistinct energy dispersive pixels on a CCD matrix. At present, the resolution\nlimit of color X-ray camera systems can go down to several microns and is\nmainly restricted to pixel dimensions. The recent development of an efficient\nsubpixel resolution algorithm allows a release from pixel size, limiting the\nresolution only to the quality of the optics. In this work polycapillary\nproperties that influence the spatial resolution are systematized and assessed\nboth theoretically and experimentally. It is demonstrated that with the current\ntechnological level reaching one micron resolution is challenging, but\npossible.\n", "  Establishing precise control over the shape and the interactions of the\nmicroscopic building blocks is essential for design of macroscopic soft\nmaterials with novel structural, optical and mechanical properties. Here, we\ndemonstrate robust assembly of DNA origami filaments into cholesteric liquid\ncrystals, 1D supramolecular twisted ribbons and 2D colloidal membranes. The\nexquisite control afforded by the DNA origami technology establishes a\nquantitative relationship between the microscopic filament structure and the\nmacroscopic cholesteric pitch. Furthermore, it also enables robust assembly of\n1D twisted ribbons, which behave as effective supramolecular polymers whose\nstructure and elastic properties can be precisely tuned by controlling the\ngeometry of the elemental building blocks. Our results demonstrate the\npotential synergy between DNA origami technology and colloidal science, in\nwhich the former allows for rapid and robust synthesis of complex particles,\nand the latter can be used to assemble such particles into bulk materials.\n", "  Harnessing the properties of vortices in superconductors is crucial for\nfundamental science as well as technological applications; thus, it has been an\nongoing goal to develop experimental techniques that can locally probe and\ncontrol vortices. Here, we present a scanning probe technique that enables\nstudies of vortex dynamics in superconducting systems by leveraging the\nresonant behavior of a raster-scanned, magnetic-tipped cantilever. Key features\nof this experimental platform are the high degree of tunability and the local\nnature of the probe. Applying this technique to lattices of superconductor\nisland arrays on a metal, we obtain a variety of striking spatial patterns that\nencode information about the energy landscape for vortices in the system. We\ninterpret these patterns in terms of local vortex dynamics, and extract the\nrelative strengths of the characteristic energy scales in the system, such as\nthe vortex-magnetic field and vortex-vortex interaction strengths, as well as\nthe vortex chemical potential. We also demonstrate that the relative strengths\nof the interactions can be tuned. This experimental setup has the potential for\nfuture applications in more complex systems, as well as in the manipulation of\nvortex-bound Majorana fermions for quantum computation.\n", "  We investigate a quantum geometric space in the context of what could be\nconsidered an emerging effective theory from Quantum Gravity. Specifically we\nconsider a two-parameter class of twisted Poincar\\'e algebras, from which\nLie-algebraic noncommutativities of the translations are derived as well as\nassociative star-products, deformed Riemannian geometries, Lie-algebraic\ntwisted Minkowski spaces and quantum effects that arise as noncommutativities.\nStarting from a universal differential algebra of forms based on the above\nmentioned Lie-algebraic noncommutativities of the translations, we construct\nthe noncommutative differential forms and Inner and Outer derivations, which\nare the noncommutative equivalents of the vector fields in the case of\ncommutative differential geometry. Having established the essentials of this\nformalism we construct a bimodule, required to be central under the action of\nthe Inner derivations in order to have well defined contractions and from where\nthe algebraic dependence of its coefficients is derived. This again then\ndefines the noncommutative equivalent of the geometrical line-element in\ncommutative differential geometry. We stress, however, that even though the\ncomponents of the twisted metric are by construction symmetric in their algebra\nvaluation, this is not so for their inverse and thus to construct it we made\nuse of Gel'fand's theory of quasi-determinants, which is conceptually\nstraightforward but computationally becoming quite complicate beyond an algebra\nof 3 generators. The consequences of the noncommutativity of the Lie-algebra\ntwisted geometry are further discussed.\n", "  Manifolds with infinite cylindrical ends have continuous spectrum of\nincreasing multiplicity as energy grows, and in general embedded resonances and\neigenvalues can accumulate at infinity. However, we prove that if geodesic\ntrapping is sufficiently mild, then such an accumulation is ruled out, and\nmoreover the cutoff resolvent is uniformly bounded at high energies. We obtain\nas a corollary the existence of resonance free regions near the continuous\nspectrum.\n  We also obtain improved estimates when the resolvent is cut off away from\npart of the trapping, and along the way we prove some resolvent estimates for\nrepulsive potentials on the half line which may be of independent interest.\n", "  We describe wave decay rates associated to embedded resonances and spectral\nthresholds for manifolds with infinite cylindrical ends. We show that if the\ncut-off resolvent is polynomially bounded at high energies, as is the case in\ncertain favorable geometries, then there is an associated asymptotic expansion,\nup to a $O(t^{-k_0})$ remainder, of solutions of the wave equation on compact\nsets as $t \\to \\infty$. In the most general such case we have $k_0=1$, and\nunder an additional assumption on the ends of the manifold we have $k_0 =\n\\infty$. If we localize the solutions to the wave equation in frequency as well\nas in space, our results hold for quite general manifolds with infinite\ncylindrical ends.\n", "  This document describes a code to perform parameter estimation and model\nselection in targeted searches for continuous gravitational waves from known\npulsars using data from ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We describe\nthe general workings of the code and characterise it on simulated data\ncontaining both noise and simulated signals. We also show how it performs\ncompared to a previous MCMC and grid-based approach to signal parameter\nestimation. Details how to run the code in a variety of cases are provided in\nAppendix A.\n", "  Direct numerical simulation is performed to study compressible, viscous flow\naround a circular cylinder. The present study considers two-dimensional,\nshock-free continuum flow by varying the Reynolds number between 20 and 100 and\nthe freestream Mach number between 0 and 0.5. The results indicate that\ncompressibility effects elongate the near wake for cases above and below the\ncritical Reynolds number for two-dimensional flow under shedding. The wake\nelongation becomes more pronounced as the Reynolds number approaches this\ncritical value. Moreover, we determine the growth rate and frequency of linear\ninstability for cases above the critical Reynolds number. From the analysis, it\nis observed that the frequency of the B\\'enard-von K\\'arm\\'an vortex street in\nthe time-periodic, fully-saturated flow increases from the dominant unstable\nfrequency found from the linear stability analysis as the Reynolds number\nincreases from its critical value, even for the low range of Reynolds numbers\nconsidered. We also notice that the compressibility effects reduce the growth\nrate and dominant frequency in the linear growth stage. Semi-empirical\nfunctional relationships for the growth rate and the dominant frequency in\nlinearized flow around the cylinder in terms of the Reynolds number and\nfreestream Mach number are presented.\n", "  Higgs resonance modes in condensed matter systems are generally broad;\nmeaning large decay widths or short relaxation times. This common feature has\nobscured and limited their observation to a select few systems. Contrary to\nthis, the present work predicts that Higgs resonances in magnetic field\ninduced, three-dimensional magnon Bose-condensates have vanishingly small decay\nwidths. Specifically for parameters relating to TlCuCl$_3$, we find an energy\n($\\Delta_H$) to width ($\\Gamma_H$) ratio $\\Delta_H/\\Gamma_H\\sim500$, making\nthis the narrowest predicted Higgs mode in a condensed matter system, some two\norders of magnitude `narrower' than the sharpest condensed matter Higgs\nobserved so far.\n", "  The subject of topological materials has attracted immense attention in\ncondensed-matter physics, because they host new quantum states of matter\ncontaining Dirac, Majorana, or Weyl fermions. Although Majorana fermions can\nonly exist on the surface of topological superconductors, Dirac and Weyl\nfermions can be realized in both 2D and 3D materials. The latter are semimetals\nwith Dirac/Weyl cones either not tilted (type I) or tilted (type II). Although\nboth Dirac and Weyl fermions have massless nature with the nontrivial Berry\nphase, the formation of Weyl fermions in 3D semimetals require either\ntime-reversal or inversion symmetry breaking to lift degeneracy at Dirac\npoints. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that canted antiferromagnetic\nBaMnSb2 is a 3D Weyl semimetal with a 2D electronic structure. The Shubnikov-de\nHass oscillations of the magnetoresistance give nearly zero effective mass with\nhigh mobility and the nontrivial Berry phase. The ordered magnetic arrangement\n(ferromagnetic ordering in the ab plane and antiferromagnetic ordering along\nthe c axis below 286 K) breaks the time-reversal symmetry, thus offering us an\nideal platform to study magnetic Weyl fermions in a centrosymmetric material.\n", "  Quantum walks have received a great deal of attention recently because they\ncan be used to develop new quantum algorithms and to simulate interesting\nquantum systems. In this work, we focus on a model called staggered quantum\nwalk, which employs advanced ideas of graph theory and has the advantage of\nincluding the most important instances of other discrete-time models. The\nevolution operator of the staggered model is obtained from a tessellation\ncover, which is defined in terms of a set of partitions of the graph into\ncliques. It is important to establish the minimum number of tessellations\nrequired in a tessellation cover, and what classes of graphs admit a small\nnumber of tessellations. We describe two main results: (1) infinite classes of\ngraphs where we relate the chromatic number of the clique graph to the minimum\nnumber of tessellations required in a tessellation cover, and (2) the problem\nof deciding whether a graph is $k$-tessellable for $k\\ge 3$ is NP-complete.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are topologically-protected spin textures with attractive\nproperties suitable for high-density and low-power spintronic device\napplications. Much effort has been dedicated to understanding the dynamical\nbehaviours of the magnetic skyrmions. However, experimental observation of the\nultrafast dynamics of this chiral magnetic texture in real space, which is the\nhallmark of its quasiparticle nature, has so far remained elusive. Here, we\nreport nanosecond-dynamics of a 100 nm-size magnetic skyrmion during a current\npulse application, using a time-resolved pump-probe soft X-ray imaging\ntechnique. We demonstrate that distinct dynamic excitation states of magnetic\nskyrmions, triggered by current-induced spin-orbit torques, can be reliably\ntuned by changing the magnitude of spin-orbit torques. Our findings show that\nthe dynamics of magnetic skyrmions can be controlled by the spin-orbit torque\non the nanosecond time scale, which points to exciting opportunities for\nultrafast and novel skyrmionic applications in the future.\n", "  Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a hugely important subject with\napplications in almost every engineering field, however, fluid simulations are\nextremely computationally and memory demanding. Towards this end, we present\nLat-Net, a method for compressing both the computation time and memory usage of\nLattice Boltzmann flow simulations using deep neural networks. Lat-Net employs\nconvolutional autoencoders and residual connections in a fully differentiable\nscheme to compress the state size of a simulation and learn the dynamics on\nthis compressed form. The result is a computationally and memory efficient\nneural network that can be iterated and queried to reproduce a fluid\nsimulation. We show that once Lat-Net is trained, it can generalize to large\ngrid sizes and complex geometries while maintaining accuracy. We also show that\nLat-Net is a general method for compressing other Lattice Boltzmann based\nsimulations such as Electromagnetism.\n", "  We first study the problem of the one-loop partition function for a free\nmassive quantum field theory living on a fixed background hyperbolic space on\nthe field of real numbers, $\\mathbb{H}^n(\\mathbb{R}), \\,\\, n\\geq 2$. Earlier\nattempts were limited to $n=3$ dimensions due to the computational complexity.\nWe have developed a new method to determine the fundamental solution of the\nheat equation and techniques to specify its asymptotics in the small time\nlimit. These enable us to determine the regular part and the ultra violet\ndivergences of the one-loop effective action in the scalar case. The\ncontribution of the Abelian gauge excitations to the one-loop partition\nfunction were treated separately using Fourier analysis and bi-tensor\ntechniques on $\\mathbb{H}^n(\\mathbb{R})$. Finally, by employing the DeWitt's\nmethod, we confirmed the correctness and extended our results to any dimension\nregarding the first three heat kernel coefficients.\n", "  We present the first observations of hydrogen line emission detected around\nthe B-type star HD 46487, a well-studied star in the CoRoT field of view. The\nemission is only evident in the H$\\alpha$ line, for which the observed\nviolet-red peak separation ($\\Delta v_{p}$) is typical of a B$e$ star with a\ncircumstellar disk. The absence of dust emission from the infrared spectral\nenergy distribution excludes the possibility of a very young star. The star's\nmagnitude (V=5.079) and regular use in the literature for a variety of studies\nsuggests that the line emission had a high probability of being found\npreviously, had it been evident; since such was not the case, we believe that\nthe B$e$ phenomenon for HD 46487 has only very recently \"turned on.\" We\ntherefore recommend that this star be spectroscopically and photometrically\nmonitored to track continued changes to its circumstellar morphology.\n", "  The problem of synchronization of coupled Hamiltonian systems exhibits\ninteresting features due to the non-uniform or mixed nature (regular and\nchaotic) of the phase space. We study these features by investigating the\nsynchronization of unidirectionally coupled area-preserving maps coupled by the\nPecora-Carroll method. We find that coupled standard maps show complete\nsynchronization for values of the nonlinearity parameter at which regular\nstructures are still present in phase space. The distribution of\nsynchronization times has a power law tail indicating long synchronization\ntimes for at least some of the synchronizing trajectories. With the\nintroduction of coherent structures using parameter perturbation in the system,\nthis distribution crosses over to exponential behavior, indicating shorter\nsynchronization times, and the number of initial conditions which synchronize\nincreases significantly, indicating an enhancement in the basin of\nsynchronization. On the other hand, coupled blinking vortex maps display both\nphase synchronization and phase slips, depending on the location of the initial\nconditions. We discuss the implication of our results.\n", "  Highlights of measurements of the properties of the top quark at the LHC are\npresented. The measurements probe a range of the properties of the top quark,\nincluding the structure of the $Wtb$ vertex, the top-Z coupling and the\ntop-quark mass. The results are compared to Standard Model predictions and in\nsome cases limits on physics beyond the Standard Model are also extracted in\nthe context of effective field theory models. The measurements use data\ncollected by the ATLAS and CMS experiments during pp collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 or 13 TeV.\n", "  Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) are charged particles of energies\nabove $10^{18}$ eV that originate outside of the Galaxy. Because the flux of\nthe UHECRs at Earth is very small, the only practical way of observing UHECRs\nis by measuring the extensive air showers (EAS) produced by UHECRs in the\natmosphere. This is done by using air fluorescence detectors and giant arrays\nof particle detectors on the ground. The Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and\nTelescope Array (TA) are two large cosmic ray experiments which use such\ntechniques and cover 3000 km$^2$ and 700 km$^2$ areas on the ground,\nrespectively. In this paper, we present the UHECR spectrum reported by the TA,\nusing an exposure of 6300 km$^2$ sr yr accumulated over 7 years of data taking,\nand the corresponding result of Auger, using 10 years of data with a total\nexposure exceeding 50000 km$^2$ sr yr. We review the astrophysical\ninterpretation of the two measurements, and discuss their systematic\nuncertainties.\n", "  We report the propagation of a square wave signal in a quasi-periodically\ndriven Murali-Lakshmanan-Chua (QPDMLC) circuit system. It is observed that\nsignal propagation is possible only above a certain threshold strength of the\nsquare wave or digital signal and all the values above the threshold amplitude\nare termed as 'region of signal propagation'. Then, we extend this region of\nsignal propagation to perform various logical operations like AND/NAND/OR/NOR\nand hence it is also designated as the 'region of logical operation'. Based on\nthis region, we propose implementing the dynamic logic gates, namely\nAND/NAND/OR/NOR, which can be decided by the asymmetrical input square waves\nwithout altering the system parameters. Further, we show that a single QPDMLC\nsystem will produce simultaneously two outputs which are complementary to each\nother. As a result, a single QPDMLC system yields either AND as well as NAND or\nOR as well as NOR gates simultaneously. Then we combine the corresponding two\nQPDMLC systems in a cross-coupled way and report that its dynamics mimics that\nof fundamental R-S flip-flop circuit. All these phenomena have been explained\nwith analytical solutions of the circuit equations characterizing the system\nand finally the results are compared with the corresponding numerical and\nexperimental analysis.\n", "  The renewed Green's function approach to calculating the angular Fock\ncoefficients, $\\psi_{k,p}(\\alpha,\\theta)$ is presented. The final formulas are\nsimplified and specified to be applicable for analytical as well as numerical\ncalculations. The Green's function formulas with the hyperspherical angles\n$\\theta=0,\\pi$ (arbitrary $\\alpha$) or $\\alpha=0,\\pi$ (arbitrary $\\theta$) are\nindicated as corresponding to the angular Fock coefficients possessing physical\nmeaning. The most interesting case of $\\theta=0$ corresponding to a collinear\narrangement of the particles is studied in detail. It is emphasized that this\ncase represents the generalization of the specific cases of the\nelectron-nucleus ($\\alpha=0$) and electron-electron ($\\alpha=\\pi/2$)\ncoalescences. It is shown that the Green's function method for $\\theta=0$\nenables us to calculate any component/subcomponent of the angular Fock\ncoefficient in the form of a single series representation with arbitrary angle\n$\\theta$. Those cases, where the Green's function approach can not be applied,\nare thoroughly studied, and the corresponding solutions are found.\n", "  Spatial profile of the Majorana fermion wave function in a one-dimensional\n$p$-wave superconductors ($\\cal{PWS}$) with quasi periodic disorder is shown to\nexhibit spatial oscillations. These oscillations damp out in the interior of\nthe chain and are characterized by a period that has topological origin and is\nequal to the Chern number determining the Hall conductivity near half-filling\nof a two-dimensional electron gas in a crystal. This mapping unfolds in view of\na correspondence between the critical point for the topological transition in\n$\\cal{PWS}$ and the {\\it strong coupling fixed point} of the Harper's equation.\nOscillatory character of these modes persist in a generalized model related to\nan extended Harper system where the electrons also tunnel to the diagonals of a\nsquare lattice. However, beyond a bicritical point, the Majorana oscillations\noccur with a random period, characterized by an invariant fractal set.\n", "  We discuss recent searches for new physics using high-energy atmospheric\nneutrino data from IceCube, namely sterile neutrinos with masses in the range\n$\\Delta m^2 = 0.01$ eV$^2$ - 10 eV$^2$, and non-standard interactions (NSI) in\nthe $\\nu_\\mu - \\nu_\\tau$ sector. We also present a brief review of the current\nstatus of NSI theory and phenomenology.\n", "  Purpose: Spatio-temporal encoding (SPEN) experiments can deliver single-scan\nMR images without folding complications and with robustness to chemical shift\nand susceptibility artifacts. It is here shown that further resolution\nimprovements can arise by relying on multiple receivers, to interpolate the\nsampled data along the low-bandwidth dimension. The ensuing multiple-sensor\ninterpolation is akin to recently introduced SPEN interleaving procedures,\nalbeit without requiring multiple shots.\n  Methods: By casting SPEN's spatial rasterization in k-space, it becomes\nevident that local k-data interpolations enabled by multiple receivers are akin\nto real-space interleaving of SPEN images. The practical implementation of such\nresolution-enhancing procedure becomes similar to those normally used in SMASH\nor SENSE, yet relaxing these methods' fold-over constraints.\n  Results: Experiments validating the theoretical expectations were carried out\non phantoms and human volunteers on a 3T scanner. The experiments showed the\nexpected resolution enhancement, at no cost in the sequence's complexity. With\nthe addition of multibanding and stimulated echo procedures, 48-slices\nfull-brain coverage could be recorded free from distortions at sub-mm\nresolution, in 3 sec.\n  Conclusion: Super-resolved SPEN with SENSE (SUSPENSE) achieves the goals of\nmulti-shot SPEN interleaving within one single scan, delivering single-shot\nsub-mm in-plane resolutions in scanners equipped with suitable multiple\nsensors.\n", "  The measurement problem in quantum mechanics originates in the inability of\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation to predict definite outcomes of measurements. This\nis due to the lack of objectivity of the eigenstates of the measuring\napparatus. Such objectivity can be achieved if a unified realist conceptual\nframework can be formulated in terms of wave functions and operators acting on\nthem for both the quantum and classical domains. Such a framework was proposed\nand an equation for the wave function (13, 14) smoothly interpolates between\nthe quantum and classical limits. The arguments leading to the equation are\nclarified in this paper, and the theory is developed further. The measurement\nproblem in quantum mechanics is then briefly reviewed and re-examined from the\npoint of view of this theory, and it is shown how the classical limit of the\nwave function of the measuring apparatus leads to a natural solution of the\nproblem of definite measurement outcomes without the need for either collapse\nor pragmatic thermodynamic arguments. This is consistent with Bohr's emphasis\non the primacy of classical concepts and classical measuring devices. Possible\ntests of the theory using low-dimensional systems such as quantum dots are\nindicated.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the universe on the background\nof f-essence when a non-minimal coupling with gravity. Field equations are\nobtained and using the Noether theorem, explicit forms of the coupling function\nand the Lagrange function of the f-essence were obtained. Accordingly, for this\nmodel, the cosmological parameters that describe the accelerated expansion of\nthe universe are determined.\n", "  Previously, we have considered the equations of motion of the three-body\nproblem in a Lagrange form (which means a consideration of relative motions of\n3-bodies in regard to each other). Analyzing such a system of equations, we\nconsidered the case of small-body motion of negligible mass around the 2-nd of\ntwo giant-bodies (which are rotating around their common centre of masses on\nKepler trajectories), the mass of which is assumed to be less than the mass of\ncentral body. In the current development, we have derived a key parameter that\ndetermines the character of quasi-circular motion of the small 3-rd body\nrelative to the 2-nd body (Planet). Namely, by making several approximations in\nthe equations of motion of the three-body problem, such the system could be\nreduced to the key governing Riccati-type ordinary differential equations.\nUnder assumptions of R3BP (restricted three-body problem), we additionally note\nthat Riccati-type ODEs above should have the invariant form if the key\ngoverning (dimensionless) parameter remains in the range 0.001-0.01. Such an\namazing fact let us evaluate the forbidden zones for Moons orbits in the inner\nSolar system or the zones of the meanings of distances (between Moon-Planet)\nfor which the motion of small body could be predicted to be unstable according\nto basic features of the solutions of Riccati-type.\n", "  Under irradiation, SiC develops damage commonly referred to as black spot\ndefects, which are speculated to be self-interstitial atom clusters. To\nunderstand the evolution of these defect clusters and their impacts (e.g.,\nthrough radiation induced swelling) on the performance of SiC in nuclear\napplications, it is important to identify the cluster composition, structure,\nand shape. In this work the genetic algorithm code StructOpt was utilized to\nidentify groundstate cluster structures in 3C-SiC. The genetic algorithm was\nused to explore clusters of up to ~30 interstitials of C-only, Si-only, and\nSi-C mixtures embedded in the SiC lattice. We performed the structure search\nusing Hamiltonians from both density functional theory and empirical\npotentials. The thermodynamic stability of clusters was investigated in terms\nof their composition (with a focus on Si-only, C-only, and stoichiometric) and\nshape (spherical vs. planar), as a function of the cluster size (n). Our\nresults suggest that large Si-only clusters are likely unstable, and clusters\nare predominantly C-only for n <= 10 and stoichiometric for n > 10. The results\nimply that there is an evolution of the shape of the most stable clusters,\nwhere small clusters are stable in more spherical geometries while larger\nclusters are stable in more planar configurations. We also provide an estimated\nenergy vs. size relationship, E(n), for use in future analysis.\n", "  The quantum description of an atom with a magnetic quadrupole moment in the\npresence of a uniform effective magnetic field is analysed. The atom is also\nsubject to rotation and a scalar potential proportional to the inverse of the\nradial distance. It is shown that the spectrum of energy is modified, in\ncontrast to the Landau-type levels, and there is a restriction on the possible\nvalues of the cyclotron frequency which stems from the influence of the\nrotation and scalar potential proportional to the inverse of the radial\ndistance.\n", "  Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is one of the potential precursors of complex\npre-biotic species in space. Here we present a detailed experimental study of\nhydroxylamine formation through nitric oxide (NO) surface hydrogenation for\nastronomically relevant conditions. The aim of this work is to investigate\nhydroxylamine formation efficiencies in polar (water-rich) and non-polar\n(carbon monoxide-rich) interstellar ice analogues. A complex reaction network\ninvolving both final (N2O, NH2OH) and intermediate (HNO, NH2O, etc.) products\nis discussed. The main conclusion is that hydroxylamine formation takes place\nvia a fast and barrierless mechanism and it is found to be even more abundantly\nformed in a water-rich environment at lower temperatures. In parallel, we\nexperimentally verify the non-formation of hydroxylamine upon UV photolysis of\nNO ice at cryogenic temperatures as well as the non-detection of NC- and\nNCO-bond bearing species after UV processing of NO in carbon monoxide-rich\nices. Our results are implemented into an astrochemical reaction model, which\nshows that NH2OH is abundant in the solid phase under dark molecular cloud\nconditions. Once NH2OH desorbs from the ice grains, it becomes available to\nform more complex species (e.g., glycine and beta-alanine) in gas phase\nreaction schemes.\n", "  Solid state astrochemical reaction pathways have the potential to link the\nformation of small nitrogen-bearing species, like NH3 and HNCO, and prebiotic\nmolecules, specifically amino acids. To date, the chemical origin of such small\nnitrogen containing species is still not well understood, despite the fact that\nammonia is an abundant constituent of interstellar ices toward young stellar\nobjects and quiescent molecular clouds. This is mainly because of the lack of\ndedicated laboratory studies. The aim of the present work is to experimentally\ninvestigate the formation routes of NH3 and HNCO through non-energetic surface\nreactions in interstellar ice analogues under fully controlled laboratory\nconditions and at astrochemically relevant temperatures. This study focuses on\nthe formation of NH3 and HNCO in CO-rich (non-polar) interstellar ices that\nsimulate the CO freeze-out stage in dark interstellar cloud regions, well\nbefore thermal and energetic processing start to become relevant. We\ndemonstrate and discuss the surface formation of solid HNCO through the\ninteraction of CO molecules with NH radicals - one of the intermediates in the\nformation of solid NH3 upon sequential hydrogenation of N atoms. The importance\nof HNCO for astrobiology is discussed.\n", "  We consider the gap creation problem in an antidot graphene lattice, i.e. a\nsheet of graphene with periodically distributed obstacles. We prove several\nspectral results concerning the size of the gap and its dependence on different\nnatural parameters related to the antidot lattice.\n", "  Drift effects play a significant role in the transport of charged particles\nin the heliosphere. A turbulent magnetic field is also known to reduce the\neffects of particle drifts. The exact nature of this reduction, however, is not\nclear. This study aims to provide some insight into this reduction, and\nproposes a relatively simple, tractable means of modelling it that provides\nresults in reasonable agreement with numerical simulations of the drift\ncoefficient in a turbulent magnetic field.\n", "  Some reflections are presented on the state of the search for a quantum\ntheory of gravity. I discuss diverse regimes of possible quantum gravitational\nphenomenon, some well explored, some novel.\n", "  The surface formation of NH3 and its deuterated isotopologues - NH2D, NHD2,\nand ND3 - is investigated at low temperatures through the simultaneous addition\nof hydrogen and deuterium atoms to nitrogen atoms in CO-rich interstellar ice\nanalogues. The formation of all four ammonia isotopologues is only observed up\nto 15 K, and drops below the detection limit for higher temperatures.\nDifferences between hydrogenation and deuteration yields result in a clear\ndeviation from a statistical distribution in favour of deuterium enriched\nspecies. The data analysis suggests that this is due to a higher sticking\nprobability of D atoms to the cold surface, a property that may generally apply\nto molecules that are formed in low temperature surface reactions. The results\nfound here are used to interpret ammonia deuterium fractionation as observed in\npre-protostellar cores.\n", "  Light sterile neutrino oscillations can be partially or completely washed out\nat short-baseline experiments due to the breaking of neutrino production\ncoherence. In this work we address this issue in sterile searches at\n$\\nu$STORM, an experimental proposal for a beam of neutrinos from the decay of\nstored muons. We work with 3+1 and 3+2 models, the latter introducing CP\nviolation at short-baselines. We find that decoherence effects are only\nrelevant for sterile masses above $\\Delta m^2 \\gtrsim 10$ eV$^2$, and that,\neven in that regime, we are able to place strong appearance bounds in such\nclean environments. In addition, the novel signatures of CP violation in the\nparameter space of interest can be identified with a significance of up to\n$\\gtrsim 3 \\sigma$.\n", "  This work explores the Zn vacancy in ZnO using hybrid density functional\ntheory calculations. The Zn vacancy is predicted to be an exceedingly deep\npolaronic acceptor that can bind a localized hole on each of the four\nnearest-neighbor O ions. The hole localization is accompanied by a distinct\noutward relaxation of the O ions, which leads to lower symmetry and reduced\nformation energy. Notably, we find that initial symmetry-breaking is required\nto capture this effect, which might explain the absence of polaronic hole\nlocalization in some previous hybrid density functional studies. We present a\nsimple model to rationalize our findings with regard to the approximately\nequidistant thermodynamic charge-state transition levels. Furthermore, by\nemploying a one-dimensional configuration coordinate model with parameters\nobtained from the hybrid density functional theory calculations, luminescence\nlineshapes were calculated. The results show that the isolated Zn vacancy is\nunlikely to be the origin of the commonly observed luminescence in the visible\npart of the emission spectrum from \\textit{n}-type material, but rather the\nluminescence in the infrared region.\n", "  We develop two-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations to examine the\nmotion of disks under thermal fluctuations and Hookean forces. Our simulations\nare designed to be experimental-like, since the experimental conditions define\nthe available time-scales which characterize the solution of Langevin\nequations. To define the fluid model and methodology, we explain the basics of\nthe theory of Brownian motion applicable to quasi-twodimensional diffusion of\noptically-trapped microspheres. Using the data produced by the simulations, we\npropose an alternative methodology to calculate diffusion coefficients. We\nobtain that, using typical input parameters in video-microscopy experiments,\nthe averaged values of the diffusion coefficient differ from the theoretical\none less than a 1\\%.\n", "  Asteroid families are valuable source of information to many asteroid-related\nre- searches, assuming a reliable list of their members could be obtained.\nHowever, as the number of known asteroids increases fast it becomes more and\nmore difficult to obtain robust list of members of an asteroid family. Here we\nare proposing a new approach to deal with the problem, based on the well known\nHierarchical Clustering Method (HCM). An additional step in the whole procedure\nis introduced in order to reduce a so-called chaining effect. The main idea is\nto prevent chaining through an al- ready identified interloper. We show that in\nthis way a number of potential interlopers among family members is\nsignificantly reduced. Moreover, we developed an automatic on-line based portal\nto apply this procedure, i.e to generate a list of family members as well as a\nlist of potential interlopers. The Asteroid Families Portal (AFP) is freely\navailable to all interested researchers.\n", "  This study focuses on the formation of two molecules of astrobiological\nimportance - glycolaldehyde (HC(O)CH2OH) and ethylene glycol (H2C(OH)CH2OH) -\nby surface hydrogenation of CO molecules. Our experiments aim at simulating the\nCO freeze-out stage in interstellar dark cloud regions, well before thermal and\nenergetic processing become dominant. It is shown that along with the formation\nof H2CO and CH3OH - two well established products of CO hydrogenation - also\nmolecules with more than one carbon atom form. The key step in this process is\nbelieved to be the recombination of two HCO radicals followed by the formation\nof a C-C bond. The experimentally established reaction pathways are implemented\ninto a continuous-time random-walk Monte Carlo model, previously used to model\nthe formation of CH3OH on astrochemical time-scales, to study their impact on\nthe solid-state abundances in dense interstellar clouds of glycolaldehyde and\nethylene glycol.\n", "  Polarisation of radio pulsar profiles involves a number of poorly understood,\nintriguing phenomena, such as the existence of comparable amounts of orthogonal\npolarisation modes (OPMs), strong distortions of polarisation angle (PA) curves\ninto shapes inconsistent with the rotating vector model (RVM), and the strong\ncircular polarisation V which can be maximum (instead of zero) at the OPM\njumps. It is shown that the existence of comparable OPMs and of the large V\nresults from a coherent addition of phase-delayed waves in natural propagation\nmodes, which are produced by an incident linearly polarised signal. The\ncoherent mode summation implies opposite polarisation properties to those known\nfrom the incoherent case, in particular, the OPM jumps occur at peaks of V ,\nwhereas V changes sign at a maximum of the linear polarisation fraction L/I.\nThese features are indispensable to interpret various observed polarisation\neffects. It is shown that statistical properties of the emission mechanism and\nof propagation effects can be efficiently parametrised in a simple model of\ncoherent mode addition, which is successfully applied to complex polarisation\nphenomena, such as the stepwise PA curve of PSR B1913+16 and the strong\ndistortions of the PA curve within core components of pulsars B1933+16 and\nB1237+25. The inclusion of coherent mode addition opens the possibility for a\nnumber of new polarisation effects, such as inversion of relative modal\nstrength, twin minima in L/I coincident with peaks in V , 45 deg PA jumps in\nweakly polarised emission, and loop-shaped core PA distortions. The empirical\ntreatment of the coherency of mode addition makes it possible to advance the\nunderstanding of pulsar polarisation beyond the RVM model.\n", "  Milgromian dynamics (MD or MOND) is a promising physical description\nexcelling especially in galaxies. When formulated as a modified gravity theory,\nit leads to the so called external field effect (EFE). In the case of the solar\nsystem this means that bodies orbiting the Sun are influenced, beyond its tidal\neffect, by the external gravitational field of the Galaxy with magnitude\n$\\sim2\\times10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ and time-varying direction. Aphelia of\nintermediate outer Oort cloud (OC) comets ($30<X<60,~X\\equiv\n10^{6}/a[\\text{au}]$, where $a$ is semimajor axis) are distributed\nnon-uniformly on the celestial sphere, showing an apparent concentration around\na great circle centered at Galactic longitudes $L=-45$ and 135 deg. Such\nnon-uniformity is beyond that attributable to the classical injectors of\ncomets, stellar encounters and the Galactic tides, as well as the expected\nobservational biases. We investigated a hypothesis that the great circle\nconcentration of aphelia is a consequence of the long-term action of EFE in the\nframework of MD. We considered exclusively quasi-linear MOND (QUMOND) theory.\nWe built our model of the OC in MD on an analytical approximation of the QUMOND\npotential for a point mass in the dominant external field of constant\nmagnitude. The model is well applicable at heliocentric distances\n$r\\gtrsim10~000$ au. Constraints on the strength of EFE found by the analysis\nof the Cassini radio-tracking data were taken into account. We demonstrated\ncharacteristic imprint of the EFE on the distribution of aphelia of candidate\nouter OC comets that migrated down to $r=10~000$ au. By both analytical and\nnumerical calculations, we showed that the combined effect of EFE and the\nGalactic tides could qualitatively account for the characteristic features seen\nin the observed distribution of aphelia of the outer OC comets.\n"]}
