relaxation properties of a system of\ntwo interacting qubits in the two cases (I) two independent bosonic baths and\n(II) one common bath, at temperature T. The entanglement dynamics is studied in\nterms of the concurrence C (t) between the two spins and of the von Neumann\nentropy S(t) with respect to the bath, as a function of time. We prove that the\nsystem does thermalize. In the case (II) of a single bath, the existence of a\ndecoherence-free (DFS) subspace makes entanglement dynamics very rich. We show\nthat when the system is initially in a state with a component in the DFS the\nrelaxation time is surprisingly long, showing the existence of semi-decoherence\nfree subspaces. The equilibrium state in this case is not the Gibbs state. The\nentanglement dynamics for the single bath case is also studied as a function of\ntemperature, coupling strength with the environment and strength of tunneling\ncoupling. The case of the mixed state is finally shown and discussed.\n", "  We irradiated an rf-SQUID qubit with large-amplitude and high frequency\nelectromagnetic field. Population transitions between macroscopic distinctive\nquantum states due to Landau-Zener transitions at energy-level avoided\ncrossings were observed. The qubit population on the excited states as a\nfunction of flux detuning and microwave power exhibits interference patterns.\nSome novel features are found in the interference and a model based on rate\nequations can well address the features.\n", "  We present three dimensional spectroscopy of eleven E+A galaxies, selected\nfor their strong H-delta absorption but weak (or non-existent) [OII]3727 and\nH-alpha emission. This selection suggests that a recent burst of star-formation\nwas triggered but subsequently abruptly ended. We probe the spatial and\nspectral properties of both the young (~1Gyr) and old (few Gyr) stellar\npopulations. Using the H-delta equivalent widths we estimate that the burst\nmasses must have been at least 10% by mass (Mburst~10^10Mo), which is also\nconsistent with the star-formation history inferred from the broad-band SEDs.\nOn average the A-stars cover ~33% of the galaxy image, extending over\n2-15kpc^2, indicating that the characteristic E+A signature is a property of\nthe galaxy as a whole and not due to a heterogeneous mixture of populations. In\napproximately half of the sample, we find that the A-stars, nebular emission,\nand continuum emission are not co-located, suggesting that the newest stars are\nforming in a different place than those that formed ~1Gyr ago, and that recent\nstar-formation has occurred in regions distinct from the oldest stellar\npopulations. At least ten of the galaxies (91%) have dynamics that class them\nas \"fast rotators\" with magnitudes and dynamics comparable to local ellipticals\nand S0's. We also find a correlation between the spatial extent of the A-stars\nand dynamics such that the fastest rotators tend to have the most compact\nA-star populations, providing new constraints on models that aim to explain the\ntransformation of later type galaxies into early types. Finally, we show that\nthere are no obvious differences between the line extents and kinematics of E+A\ngalaxies detected in the radio (AGN) compared to non-radio sources, suggesting\nthat AGN feedback does not play a dramatic role in defining their properties,\nor that its effects are short.\n", "  An imaginary-time nonuniform mesh method is presented and used to find the\nfirst 50 eigenstates and energies of up to five strongly interacting spinless\nquantum Lennard-Jones particles trapped in a one-dimensional harmonic\npotential. We show that the use of tailored grids reduces drastically the\ncomputational effort needed to diagonalize the Hamiltonian and results in a\nfavorable scaling with dimensionality. Solutions to both bosonic and fermionic\ncounterparts of this strongly interacting system are obtained, the bosonic case\nclustering as a Tonks-Girardeau crystal exhibiting the phenomenon of\nfermionization. The numerically exact excited states are used to describe the\nmelting of this crystal at finite temperature.\n", "  The Feynman path integral approach for computing equilibrium isotope effects\nand isotope fractionation corrects the approximations made in standard methods,\nalthough at significantly increased computational cost. We describe an\naccelerated path integral approach based on three ingredients: the fourth-\norder Takahashi-Imada factorization of the path integral, thermodynamic\nintegration with respect to mass, and centroid virial estimators for relevant\nfree energy derivatives. While the frst ingredient speeds up convergence to the\nquantum limit, the second and third improve statistical convergence. The\ncombined method is applied to compute the equilibrium constants for isotope\nexchange reactions H2+D=H+HD and H2+D2=2HD.\n", "  We study category O for the (centrally extended) Schr\\\"odinger algebra. We\ndetermine the quivers for all blocks and relations for blocks of nonzero\ncentral charge. We also describe the quiver and relations for the finite\ndimensional part of O. We use this to determine the center of the universal\nenveloping algebra and annihilators of Verma modules. Finally, we classify\nprimitive ideals with nonzero central charge.\n", "  This paper considers nonlinear dynamics of polarization oscillations when\nsome materials when they are subjected to the action of an electromagnetic wave\nmodeled by multifrequency forced Duffing equation. Multiresonance and chaotic\nbehavior are analysed. For analysis of the case of resonance, the method of\nmultiple scales is used and it has been found from the equation of the\namplitudes for each of the possible resonance system. Possible resonances are\ninter alia the resonances or sub superharmonic, the primary resonance and other\nresonances called secondary. The phenomena of amplitude jump and hysteresis for\npolarization were observed and analyzed. Finally, the study of chaotic behavior\nfor polarization was made by numerical simulation using the Runge- Kutta fourth\norder.\n", "  It has been found that the quantum-to-classical transition can be observed\nindependent of macroscopicity of the quantum state for a fixed degree of\nfuzziness in the coarsened references of measurements. Here, a general\nsituation, that is the degree of fuzziness can change with the rotation angle\nbetween two states (different rotation angles represent different references),\nis researched based on the reason that the fuzziness of reference can come from\ntwo kinds: the Hamiltonian (rotation frequency) and the timing (rotation time).\nOur results show that, for the fuzziness of Hamiltonian alone, the degree of\nfuzziness for reference will change with the rotation angle between two states\nand the quantum effects can still be observed no matter how much degree of\nfuzziness of Hamiltonian; for the fuzziness of timing, the degree of coarsening\nreference is unchanged with the rotation angle. Moreover, during the rotation\nof the measurement axis, the decoherence environment can also help the\nclassical-to-quantum transition due to changing the direction of measurement\naxis.\n", "  Anisotropic dark energy cosmological models are constructed in the frame work\nof generalised Brans-Dicke theory with a self interacting potential. Wet dark\nfluid characterized by a linear equation of state is considered as the source\nof dark energy. Shear scalar is considered to be proportional to the expansion\nscalar simulating an anisotropic relationship among the directional expansion\nrates. The dynamics of the universe in presence of wet dark fluid in\nanisotropic background have been discussed. The presence of evolving scalar\nfield makes it possible to get accelerating phase of expansion even for a\nlinear relationship among the directional Hubble rates. It is found that, the\nanisotropy in expansion rates does not affect the scalar field, self\ninteracting potential but it controls the non-evolving part of the Brans- Dicke\nparameter.\n", "  We obtain the energy and momentum of the Bianchi type VI_h universes using\ndifferent prescriptions for the energy-momentum complexes in the framework of\ngeneral relativity. The energy and momentum of the Bianchi VI_h universe are\nfound to be zero for the parameter h = -1 of the metric. The vanishing of these\nresults support the conjecture of Tryon that Universe must have a zero net\nvalue for all conserved quantities.This also supports the work of Nathan Rosen\nwith the Robertson-Walker metric. Moreover, it raises an interesting question:\n\"Why h=-1 case is so special?\"\n", "  We have developed our original made-to-measure (M2M) algorithm, PRIMAL, with\nthe aim of modelling the Galactic disc from upcoming Gaia data. From a Milky\nWay like N-body disc galaxy simulation, we have created mock Gaia data using\nM0III stars as tracers, taking into account extinction and the expected Gaia\nerrors. In PRIMAL, observables calculated from the N-body model are compared\nwith the target stars, at the position of the target stars. Using PRIMAL, the\nmasses of the N-body model particles are changed to reproduce the target mock\ndata, and the gravitational potential is automatically adjusted by the changing\nmass of the model particles. We have also adopted a new resampling scheme for\nthe model particles to keep the mass resolution of the N-body model relatively\nconstant. We have applied PRIMAL to this mock Gaia data and we show that PRIMAL\ncan recover the structure and kinematics of a Milky Way like barred spiral\ndisc, along with the apparent bar structure and pattern speed of the bar\ndespite the galactic extinction and the observational errors.\n", "  We continue our study of the inventory accumulation introduced by Sheffield\n(2011), which encodes a random planar map decorated by a collection of loops\nsampled from the critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) model. We prove various\n\\emph{local estimates} for the inventory accumulation model, i.e., estimates\nfor the precise number of symbols of a given type in a reduced word sampled\nfrom the model. Using our estimates, we obtain the scaling limit of the\nassociated two-dimensional random walk conditioned on the event that it stays\nin the first quadrant for one unit of time and ends up at a particular position\nin the interior of the first quadrant. We also obtain the exponent for the\nprobability that a word of length $2n$ sampled from the inventory accumulation\nmodel corresponds to an empty reduced word, which is equivalent to an\nasymptotic formula for the partition function of the critical FK planar map\nmodel. The estimates of this paper will be used in a subsequent paper to obtain\nthe scaling limit of the lattice walk associated with a finite-volume FK planar\nmap.\n", "  The upcoming 50 kt magnetized iron calorimeter (ICAL) detector at the\nIndia-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) is designed to study the atmospheric\nneutrinos and antineutrinos separately over a wide range of energies and path\nlengths. The primary focus of this experiment is to explore the Earth matter\neffects by observing the energy and zenith angle dependence of the atmospheric\nneutrinos in the multi-GeV range. This study will be crucial to address some of\nthe outstanding issues in neutrino oscillation physics, including the\nfundamental issue of neutrino mass hierarchy. In this document, we present the\nphysics potential of the detector as obtained from realistic detector\nsimulations. We describe the simulation framework, the neutrino interactions in\nthe detector, and the expected response of the detector to particles traversing\nit. The ICAL detector can determine the energy and direction of the muons to a\nhigh precision, and in addition, its sensitivity to multi-GeV hadrons increases\nits physics reach substantially. Its charge identification capability, and\nhence its ability to distinguish neutrinos from antineutrinos, makes it an\nefficient detector for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy. In this report,\nwe outline the analyses carried out for the determination of neutrino mass\nhierarchy and precision measurements of atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters\nat ICAL, and give the expected physics reach of the detector with 10 years of\nruntime. We also explore the potential of ICAL for probing new physics\nscenarios like CPT violation and the presence of magnetic monopoles.\n", "  The gravitational radiation has been proposed a long time before, as an\nexplanation for the observed relatively low spin frequencies of young neutron\nstars and of accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries as well. In the\npresent work we studied the effects of the neutron star equation of state on\nthe r-mode instability window of rotating neutron stars. Firstly, we employed a\nset of analytical solution of the Tolman-Oppemheimer-Volkoff equations with\nspecial emphasis on the Tolman VII solution. In particular, we tried to clarify\nthe effects of the bulk neutron star properties (mass, radius, density\ndistribution, crust size and elasticity) on the r-mode instability window. We\nfound that the critical angular velocity $\\Omega_c$ depends mainly on the\nneutron star radius. The effects of the gravitational mass and the mass\ndistribution are almost negligible. Secondly, we studied the effect of the\nelasticity of the crust, via to the slippage factor $S$ and also the effect of\nthe nuclear equation of state, via the slope parameter $L$, on the instability\nwindow. We found that the crust effects are more pronounced, compared to those\noriginated from the equation of state. Moreover, we proposed simple analytical\nexpressions which relate the macroscopic quantity $\\Omega_c$ to the radius, the\nparameter $L$ and the factor ${\\cal S}$. We also investigated the possibility\nto measure the radius of a neutron star and the factor ${\\cal S}$ with the help\nof accurate measures of $\\Omega_c$ and the neutron star temperature. Finally,\nwe studied the effects of the mutual friction on the instability window and\ndiscussed the results in comparison with previous similar studies.\n", "  Anisotropic dark energy model with dynamic pressure anisotropies along\ndifferent spatial directions is constructed at the backdrop of a spatially\nhomogeneous diagonal Bianchi type $V$ $(BV)$ space-time in the framework of\nGeneral Relativity. A time varying deceleration parameter generating a hybrid\nscale factor is considered to simulate a cosmic transition from early\ndeceleration to late time acceleration. We found that the pressure anisotropies\nalong the $y-$ and $z-$ axes evolve dynamically and continue along with the\ncosmic expansion without being subsided even at late times. The anisotropic\npressure along the $x-$axis becomes equal to the mean fluid pressure. At a late\nphase of cosmic evolution, the model enters into a phantom region. From a state\nfinder diagnosis, it is found that the model overlaps with $\\Lambda$CDM at late\nphase of cosmic time.\n", "  Strongly-interacting matter in the form of nuggets of nuclear-density\nmaterial are not currently excluded as dark matter candidates in the ten gram\nto hundred kiloton mass range. A recent variation on quark nugget dark matter\nmodels postulates that a first-order imbalance between matter and antimatter in\nthe quark-gluon plasma prior to hadron production in the early universe binds\nup most of the dark matter into heavy (baryon number $B \\sim 10^{25}$)\nanti-quark nuggets in the current epoch, explaining both the dark matter\npreponderance and the matter-antimatter asymmetry. Interactions of these\nmassive objects with normal matter in the Earth and Sun will lead to\nannihilation and an associated neutrino flux in the $\\sim 20-50$ MeV range. We\ncalculate these fluxes for anti-quark nuggets of sufficient number density to\naccount for the dark matter and find that current neutrino flux limits from\nSuper-Kamiokande provide stringent constraints on several possible scenarios\nfor such objects. Conventional anti-quark nuggets in the previously allowed\nmass range cannot account for more than $\\sim 1/5$ of the dark matter flux; if\nthey are in a color-superconducting phase, then their muon production during\nmatter annihilation must be suppressed by an order of magnitude below prior\nestimates if they are to remain viable dark matter candidates.\n", "  The aim of the paper is to unify the efforts in the study of integrable\nbilliards within quadrics in flat and curved spaces and to explore further the\ninterplay of symplectic and contact integrability. As a starting point in this\ndirection, we consider virtual billiard dynamics within quadrics in\npseudo--Euclidean spaces. In contrast to the usual billiards, the incoming\nvelocity and the velocity after the billiard reflection can be at opposite\nsides of the tangent plane at the reflection point. In the symmetric case we\nprove noncommutative integrability of the system and give a geometrical\ninterpretation of integrals, an analog of the classical Chasles and Poncelet\ntheorems and we show that the virtual billiard dynamics provides a natural\nframework in the study of billiards within quadrics in projective spaces, in\nparticular of billiards within ellipsoids on the sphere $\\mathbb S^{n-1}$ and\nthe Lobachevsky space $\\mathbb H^{n-1}$.\n", "  We derive the classical null energy condition, understood as a constraint on\nthe Ricci tensor, from the second law of thermodynamics applied locally to\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy associated with patches of null congruences. The\nderivation provides evidence that the null energy condition, which has usually\nbeen regarded as a condition on matter, is fundamentally a property of gravity.\n", "  Highly ordered Bi2FeMnO6 epitaxial thin films have been successfully grown on\nSrTiO3 substrate. Both synchrotron X-ray reciprocal space mapping and high\nresolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed the alternative alignment\nof Fe and Mn along [111] direction of Bi2FeMnO6 films. Magnetic and\nferroelectric properties of Bi2FeMnO6 films are characterized and analyzed. The\nroom-temperature ferroelectricity is well kept in Bi2FeMnO6 film as expected.\nHowever, it is very interesting that Bi2FeMnO6 film exhibits a typical\nspin-glass behavior and very weak magnetism rather than a ferri/ferromagnetism\nas generally believed. Our first-principles calculations suggest a spin\nfrustration model for Bi2FeMnO6, which can well explain the intriguing magnetic\nproperty of Bi2FeMnO6 film.\n", "  Fundamental forces of Nature are described by field theories, also known as\ngauge theories, based on a local gauge invariance. The simplest of them is\nquantum electrodynamics (QED), which is an example of an Abelian gauge theory.\nSuch theories describe the dynamics of massless photons and their coupling to\nmatter. However, in two spatial dimension (2D) they are known to exhibit gapped\nphases at low temperature. In the realm of quantum spin systems, it remains a\nsubject of considerable debate if their low energy physics can be described by\nemergent gauge degrees of freedom. Here we present a class of simple\ntwo-dimensional models that admit a low energy description in terms of an\nAbelian gauge theory. We find rich phase diagrams for these models comprising\nexotic deconfined phases and gapless phases - a rare example for 2D Abelian\ngauge theories. The counter-intuitive presence of gapless phases in 2D results\nfrom the emergence of additional symmetry in the models. Moreover, we propose\nschemes to realize our model with current experiments using ultracold bosonic\natoms in optical lattices.\n", "  Sufficiently high densities in Bose-Einstein condensates provide favorable\nconditions for the production of ultralong-range polyatomic molecules\nconsisting of one Rydberg atom and a number of neutral ground state atoms. The\nchemical binding properties and electronic wave functions of these exotic\nmolecules are investigated analytically via hybridized diatomic states. The\neffects of the molecular geometry on the system's properties are studied\nthrough comparisons of the adiabatic potential curves and electronic structures\nfor both symmetric and randomly configured molecular geometries. General\nproperties of these molecules with increasing numbers of constituent atoms and\nin different geometries are presented. These polyatomic states have spectral\nsignatures that lead to non-Lorentzian line-profiles.\n", "  Experiments in particle physics produce enormous quantities of data that must\nbe analyzed and interpreted by teams of physicists. This analysis is often\nexploratory, where scientists are unable to enumerate the possible types of\nsignal prior to performing the experiment. Thus, tools for summarizing,\nclustering, visualizing and classifying high-dimensional data are essential. In\nthis work, we show that meaningful physical content can be revealed by\ntransforming the raw data into a learned high-level representation using deep\nneural networks, with measurements taken at the Daya Bay Neutrino Experiment as\na case study. We further show how convolutional deep neural networks can\nprovide an effective classification filter with greater than 97% accuracy\nacross different classes of physics events, significantly better than other\nmachine learning approaches.\n", "  Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ has been synthesized and magnetic measurements have been\ncarried out, revealing that M$_{\\text{sat}}$ = 0.92 MA/m at T = 300 K. The M vs\nT curve shows a broad peak around T = 160 K. The anisotropy constant, K$_1$,\nestimated at T = 300 K, is 0.25 MJ/m$^3$. Theoretical analysis of Fe$_5$SiB$_2$\nsystem has been carried out and extended to the full range of\nFe$_5$Si$_{1-x}$P$_x$B$_2$, Fe$_5$P$_{1-x}$S$_x$B$_2$, and\n(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_5$SiB$_2$ compositions. The electronic band structures have\nbeen calculated using the Full-Potential Local-Orbital Minimum-Basis Scheme\n(FPLO-14). The calculated total magnetic moments are 9.20, 9.15, 9.59 and\n2.42$\\mu_B$ per formula units of Fe$_5$SiB$_2$, Fe$_5$PB$_2$, Fe$_5$SB$_2$, and\nCo$_5$SiB$_2$, respectively. In agreement with experiment, magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy energies (MAE's) calculated for T = 0 K changes from a negative\n(easy-plane) anisotropy -0.28 MJ/m$^3$ for Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ to the positive\n(easy-axis) anisotropy 0.35 MJ/m$^3$ for Fe$_5$PB$_2$. Further increase of the\nnumber of p-electrons in Fe$_5$P$_{1-x}$S$_x$B$_2$ leads to an increase of MAE\nup to 0.77 MJ/m$^3$ for the hypothetical Fe$_5$P$_{0.4}$S$_{0.6}$B$_2$\ncomposition. Volume variation and fixed spin moment calculations (FSM)\nperformed for Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ show an inverse relation between MAE and magnetic\nmoment in the region down to about 15\\% reduction of the spin moment. The\nalloying of Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ with Co is proposed as a practical realization of\nmagnetic moment reduction, which ought to increase MAE. MAE calculated in\nvirtual crystal approximation (VCA) for a full range of\n(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_5$SiB$_2$ compositions reaches the maximum value of 1.16\nMJ/m$^3$ at Co concentration x = 0.3, with the magnetic moment 7.75$\\mu_B$ per\nformula unit. Thus, (Fe$_{0.7}$Co$_{0.3}$)$_5$SiB$_2$ is suggested as a\ncandidate for a rare-earth free permanent magnet.\n", "  The Mott-insulating distorted perovskite SmTiO$_3$, doped with a single SrO\nlayer in a quantum-well architecture is studied by the combination of density\nfunctional theory with dynamical mean-field theory. A rich correlated\nelectronic structure in line with recent experimental investigations is\nrevealed by the given realistic many-body approach to a large-unit-cell oxide\nheterostructure. Coexistence of conducting and Mott-insulating TiO$_2$ layers\nprone to magnetic order gives rise to multi-orbital electronic transport beyond\nstandard Fermi-liquid theory. First hints towards a pseudogap opening due to\nelectron-electron scattering within a background of ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic fluctuations are detected.\n", "  For studies of quark matter in astrophysical scenarios the thermodynamic bag\nmodel (tdBag) is commonly employed. Although successful, it does not account\nfor dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (D$\\chi$SB) and repulsions due to the\nvector interaction which is crucial to explain recent observations of massive,\ntwo solar mass neutron stars. In Kl\\\"ahn & Fischer (2015) we developed the\nnovel vBag quark matter model which takes these effects into account. This\narticle extends vBag to finite temperatures and isospin asymmetry. Another\nparticular feature of vBag is the determination of the deconfinement bag\nconstant $B_{\\rm dc}$ from a given hadronic equation of state (EoS) in order to\nensure that chiral and deconfinement transitions coincide. We discuss\nconsequences of this novel approach for the phase transition construction, the\nphase diagram, and implications for protoneutron stars.\n", "  We calculate one-loop string amplitudes of open and closed strings with\nN=1,2,4 supersymmetry in four and six dimensions, by compactification on\nCalabi-Yau and K3 orbifolds. In particular, we develop a method to combine\ncontributions from all spin structures for an arbitrary number of legs at\nminimal supersymmetry. Each amplitude is cast into a compact form by\nreorganizing the kinematic building blocks and casting the worldsheet integrals\nin a basis. Infrared regularization plays an important role to exhibit the\nexpected factorization limits. We comment on implications for the one-loop\nstring effective action.\n", "  The electric solar wind sail (E-sail) is a way to propel a spacecraft by\nusing the natural solar wind as a thrust source. The problem of secular\nspinrate change was identified earlier which is due to the orbital Coriolis\neffect and tends to slowly increase or decrease the sail's spinrate, depending\non which way the sail is inclined with respect to the solar wind. Here we\npresent an E-sail design and its associated control algorithm which enable\nspinrate control during propulsive flight by the E-sail effect itself. In the\ndesign, every other maintether (\"T-tether\") is galvanically connected through\nthe remote unit with the two adjacent auxtethers, while the other maintethers\n(\"I-tethers\") are insulated from the tethers. This enables one to effectively\ncontrol the maintether and auxtether voltages separately, which in turn enables\nspinrate control. We use a detailed numerical simulation to show that the\nalgorithm can fully control the E-sail's spin state in real solar wind. The\nsimulation includes a simple and realistic set of controller sensors: an imager\nto detect remote unit angular positions and a vector accelerometer. The imager\nresolution requirement is modest and the accelerometer noise requirement is\nfeasible to achieve. The TI tether rig enables building E-sails that are able\nto control their spin state fully and yet are actuated by pure tether voltage\nmodulation from the main spacecraft and requiring no functionalities from the\nremote units during flight.\n", "  In opinion dynamics, the convergence of the heterogeneous Hegselmann-Krause\n(HK) dynamics has always been an open problem for years which looks forward to\nany essential progress. In this short note, we prove a partial convergence\nconclusion of the general heterogeneous HK dynamis. That is, there must be some\nagents who will reach static states in finite time, while the other opinions\nhave to evolve between them with a minimum distance if all the opinions does\nnot reach consensus. And this result leads to the convergence of two special\ncase of heterogeneous HK dynamics: the minimum confidence threshold is large\nenough, or the initial opinion difference is small enough.\n", "  Spin-transfer-torque random access memory (STT-RAM) is a promising candidate\nfor the next-generation of random-access-memory due to improved scalability,\nread-write speeds and endurance. However, the write pulse duration must be long\nenough to ensure a low write error rate (WER), the probability that a bit will\nremain unswitched after the write pulse is turned off, in the presence of\nstochastic thermal effects. WERs on the scale of 10$^{-9}$ or lower are\ndesired. Within a macrospin approximation, WERs can be calculated analytically\nusing the Fokker-Planck method to this point and beyond. However, dynamic\nmicromagnetic effects within the bit can affect and lead to faster switching.\nSuch micromagnetic effects can be addressed via numerical solution of the\nstochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. However,\ndetermining WERs approaching 10$^{-9}$ would require well over 10$^{9}$ such\nindependent simulations, which is infeasible. In this work, we explore\ncalculation of WER using \"rare event enhancement\" (REE), an approach that has\nbeen used for Monte Carlo simulation of other systems where rare events\nnevertheless remain important. Using a prototype REE approach tailored to the\nSTT-RAM switching physics, we demonstrate reliable calculation of a WER to\n10$^{-9}$ with sets of only approximately 10$^{3}$ ongoing stochastic LLGS\nsimulations, and the apparent ability to go further.\n", "  The efficiency of a fluid mixing device is often limited by fundamental laws\nand/or design constraints, such that a perfectly homogeneous mixture cannot be\nobtained in finite time. Here, we address the natural corollary question: Given\nthe best available mixer, what is the optimal initial tracer pattern that leads\nto the most homogeneous mixture after a prescribed finite time? For ideal\npassive tracers, we show that this optimal initial condition coincides with the\nright singular vector (corresponding to the smallest singular value) of a\nsuitably truncated Perron-Frobenius (PF) operator. The truncation of the PF\noperator is made under the assumption that there is a small length-scale\nthreshold $\\ell_\\nu$ under which the tracer blobs are considered, for all\npractical purposes, completely mixed. We demonstrate our results on two\nexamples: a prototypical model known as the sine flow and a direct numerical\nsimulation of two-dimensional turbulence. Evaluating the optimal initial\ncondition through this framework only requires the position of a dense grid of\nfluid particles at the final instance and their preimages at the initial\ninstance of the prescribed time interval. As such, our framework can be readily\napplied to flows where such data is available through numerical simulations or\nexperimental measurements.\n", "  We present here an Arabic report about supernova 1006 (SN 1006) written by\nthe famous Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Lat. Avicenna, AD 980-1037), which was not\ndiscussed in astronomical literature before. The short observational report\nabout a new star is part of Ibn Sina's book called al-Shifa', a work about\nphilosophy including physics, astronomy, and meteorology. We present the Arabic\ntext and our English translation. After a detailed discussion of the dating of\nthe observation, we show that the text specifies that the transient celestial\nobject was stationary and/or tail-less (\"a star among the stars\"), that it\n\"remained for close to three months getting fainter and fainter until it\ndisappeared\", that it \"threw out sparks\", i.e. it was scintillating and very\nbright, and that the color changed with time. The information content is\nconsistent with the other Arabic and non-Arabic reports about SN 1006. Hence,\nit is quite clear that Ibn Sina refers to SN 1006 in his report, given as an\nexample for transient celestial objects in a discussion of Aristotle's\n\"Meteorology\". Given the wording and the description, e.g. for the color\nevolution, this report is independent from other reports known so far.\n", "  Decoherence often happens in the quantum world. We try to utilize quantum\ndephasing to build an optimal thermometry. By calculating the\nCram$\\acute{e}$r-Rao bound, we prove that the Ramsey measurement is the optimal\nway to measure the temperature for uncorrelated particles. Using the optimal\nmeasurement, the metrological equivalence of product and maximally entangled\nstates of initial quantum probes that always holds. However, using Ramsey\nmeasurement, the metrological equivalence only holds in special situation.\nContrary to frequency estimation, the quantum limit can be surpassed under the\ncase $\\nu<1$. For the general Zeno regime($\\nu=2$), uncorrelated product states\nare the optimal choose in typical Ramsey spectroscopy set-up. In order to\nsurpass the standard scaling, we propose to change the interaction strength\nwith time. Finally, we investigate other environmental influences on the\nmeasurement precision of temperature. Base on it, we define a new way to\nmeasure non-Markovian effect.\n", "  We study the relationship between the UV continuum slope and infrared excess\n(IRX$\\equiv L_{\\rm IR}/L_{\\rm FUV}$) predicted by performing dust radiative\ntransfer on a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies. Our suite\nincludes both isolated disk galaxies and mergers intended to be representative\nof galaxies at both $z \\sim 0$ and $z \\sim 2-3$. Our low-redshift isolated\ndisks and mergers often populate a region around the the locally calibrated\n\\citet[][M99]{M99} relation but move well above the relation during\nmerger-induced starbursts. Our high-redshift simulated galaxies are blue and\nIR-luminous, which makes them lie above the M99 relation. The value of UV\ncontinuum slope strongly depends on the dust type used in the radiative\ntransfer calculations: Milky Way-type dust leads to significantly more negative\n(bluer) slopes compared with Small Magellanic Cloud-type dust. The effect on\n$\\beta$ due to variations in the dust composition with galaxy properties or\nredshift can dominate over other sources of $\\beta$ variations and is the\ndominant model uncertainty. The dispersion in $\\beta$ is anticorrelated with\nspecific star formation rate and tends to be higher for the $z \\sim 2-3$\nsimulations. In the actively star-forming $z \\sim 2-3$ simulated galaxies, dust\nattenuation dominates the dispersion in $\\beta$, whereas in the $z \\sim 0$\nsimulations, the contributions of SFH variations and dust are similar. For\nlow-SSFR systems at both redshifts, SFH variations dominate the dispersion.\nFinally, the simulated $z \\sim 2-3$ isolated disks and mergers both occupy a\nregion in the \\irxbeta\\ plane consistent with observed $z \\sim 2-3$ dusty\nstar-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Thus, contrary to some claims in the literature,\nthe blue colors of high-z DSFGs do not imply that they are short-lived\nstarbursts.\n", "  We present a new spectroscopic technique based in part on targeting the\nupward fluctuations of the surface brightness for studying the internal stellar\nkinematics and metallicities of low surface brightness galaxies and streams\nbeyond the Local Group. The distance to these systems makes them unsuitable for\ntargeting individual red giant branch (RGB) stars (tip of RGB at\n$I\\gtrsim24$~mag) and their surface brightness is too low ($\\mu_r\\gtrsim\n25$~mag~arcsec$^{-2}$) for integrated light spectroscopic measurements. This\ntechnique overcomes these two problems by targeting individual objects that are\nbrighter than the tip of the RGB. We apply this technique to the star-forming\ndwarf galaxy NGC 4449 and its stellar stream. We use Keck/DEIMOS data to\nmeasure the line-of-sight radial velocity out to $\\sim7$~kpc in the East side\nof the galaxy and $\\sim8$~kpc along the stream. We find that the two systems\nare likely gravitationally bound to each other and have heliocentric radial\nvelocities of $227.3\\pm10.7$~km/s and $225.8\\pm16.0$~km/s, respectively.\nNeither the stream nor the near half of the galaxy shows a significant velocity\ngradient. We estimate the stellar metallicity of the stream based on the\nequivalent width of its Calcium triplet lines and find [Fe/H]~$=-1.37\\pm0.41$,\nwhich is consistent with the metallicity-luminosity relation for Local Group\ndwarf galaxies. Whether the stream's progenitor was moderately or severely\nstripped cannot be constrained with this metallicity uncertainty. We\ndemonstrate that this new technique can be used to measure the kinematics and\n(possibly) the metallicity of the numerous faint satellites and stellar streams\nin the halos of nearby ($\\sim 4$~Mpc) galaxies.\n", "  We carried out observations of pulsar PSR B1919+21 at 324 MHz to study the\ndistribution of interstellar plasma in the direction of this pulsar. We used\nthe RadioAstron (RA) space radiotelescope together with two ground telescopes:\nWesterbork (WB) and Green Bank (GB). The maximum baseline projection for the\nspace-ground interferometer was about 60000 km. We show that interstellar\nscintillation of this pulsar consists of two components: diffractive\nscintillations from inhomogeneities in a layer of turbulent plasma at a\ndistance $z_{1} = 440$ pc from the observer or homogeneously distributed\nscattering material to pulsar; and weak scintillations from a screen located\nnear the observer at $z_{2} = 0.14 \\pm 0.05$ pc. Furthermore, in the direction\nto the pulsar we detected a prism that deflects radiation, leading to a shift\nof observed source position. We show that the influence of the ionosphere can\nbe ignored for the space-ground baseline. Analysis of the spatial coherence\nfunction for the space-ground baseline (RA-GB) yielded the scattering angle in\nthe observer plane: $\\theta_{scat}$ = 0.7 mas. An analysis of the\ntime-frequency correlation function for weak scintillations yielded the angle\nof refraction in the direction to the pulsar: $\\theta_{ref, 0}$ = 110 ms and\nthe distance to the prism $z_{prism} \\le 2$ pc.\n", "  Molecular motor proteins serve as an essential component of intracellular\ntransport by generating forces to haul cargoes along cytoskeletal filaments.\nTwo species of motors that are directed oppositely (e.g. kinesin, dynein) can\nbe attached to the same cargo, which is known to produce bidirectional net\nmotion. Although previous work focuses on the motor number as the driving noise\nsource for switching, we propose an alternative mechanism: cargo diffusion. A\nmean-field mathematical model of mechanical interactions of two populations of\nmolecular motors with cargo thermal fluctuations (diffusion) is presented to\nstudy this phenomenon. The delayed response of a motor to fluctuations in the\ncargo velocity is quantified, allowing for the reduction of the full model a\nsingle \"characteristic distance\", a proxy for the net force on the cargo. The\nsystem is then found to be metastable, with switching exclusively due to cargo\ndiffusion between distinct directional transport states. The time to switch\nbetween these states is then investigated using a mean first passage time\nanalysis. The switching time is found to be non-monotonic in the drag of the\ncargo, providing an experimental test of the theory.\n", "  Human-created engines and evolutionarily optimized molecular motors exhibit\nsophisticated design in order to harvest chemical or thermal energy for\ngenerating unidirectional motion. The complexity of these motors makes their\nrandom emergence unlikely. Molecules capable of locomotion, however, seem to be\nessential to the creation of the first self-replicator and initiation of\nDarwinian evolution, posing a question of the physical mechanism that can\nfacilitate emergence of directed motion in an isotropic environment. Here we\nshow a universal thermodynamic mechanism for spontaneous emergence of motor\nabilities in a mechanical system. A non-equilibrium system with multiple\ndegrees of freedom develops symmetry breaking that favors rectification of\nenvironmental thermal fluctuations. The corresponding velocities and its\nfluctuations are calculated. Homochirality of living matter is explained as\nchirality breaking resulting from the emergence of a motor. Universality of the\nresults provides a general extension of the Onsager relations to the non-linear\nregime.\n", "  We obtain predictions accurate at the next-to-leading order in QCD for the\nproduction of a generic spin-two particle in the most relevant channels at the\nLHC: production in association with coloured particles (inclusive, one jet, two\njets and $t\\bar t$), with vector bosons ($Z,W^\\pm,\\gamma$) and with the Higgs\nboson. We present total and differential cross sections as well as branching\nratios as a function of the mass and the collision energy also considering the\ncase of non-universal couplings to standard model particles. We find that the\nnext-to-leading order corrections give rise to sizeable $K$ factors for many\nchannels, in some cases exposing the unitarity-violating behaviour of\nnon-universal couplings scenarios, and in general greatly reduce the\ntheoretical uncertainties. Our predictions are publicly available in the\nMadGraph5\\_aMC@NLO framework and can, therefore, be directly used in\nexperimental simulations of spin-two particle production for arbitrary values\nof the mass and couplings.\n", "  A fast Alfv\\'en wave with finite amplitude is shown to grow by a stimulated\nemission process that we propose for exploitation in toroidal magnetically\nconfined fusion plasmas. Stimulated emission occurs while the wave propagates\ninward through the outer mid-plane plasma, where a population inversion of the\nenergy distribution of fusion-born ions is observed to arise naturally. Fully\nnonlinear first principles simulations, which self-consistently evolve\nparticles and fields under the Maxwell-Lorentz system, demonstrate this novel\n\"alpha-particle channelling\" scenario for the first time.\n", "  We present the discovery of a z=0.65 low-ionization broad absorption line\n(LoBAL) quasar in a post-starburst galaxy in data from the Dark Energy Survey\n(DES) and spectroscopy from the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES). LoBAL\nquasars are a minority of all BALs, and rarer still is that this object also\nexhibits broad FeII (an FeLoBAL) and Balmer absorption. This is the first BAL\nquasar that has signatures of recently truncated star formation, which we\nestimate ended about 40 Myr ago. The characteristic signatures of an FeLoBAL\nrequire high column densities, which could be explained by the emergence of a\nyoung quasar from an early, dust-enshrouded phase, or by clouds compressed by a\nblast wave. The age of the starburst component is comparable to estimates of\nthe lifetime of quasars, so if we assume the quasar activity is related to the\ntruncation of the star formation, this object is better explained by the blast\nwave scenario.\n", "  In the presence of a magnetic field frustrated spin systems may exhibit\nplateaus at fractional values of saturation magnetization. Such plateau states\nare stabilized by classical and quantum mechanisms including order-by-disorder,\ntriplon crystallization, and various competing order effects. In the case of\nelectrically conducting systems, free electrons represent an incisive probe for\nthe plateau states. Here we study the electrical transport of Ising-type rare\nearth tetraborides $R$B$_4$ ($R=$Er, Tm), a metallic Shastry-Sutherland lattice\nshowing magnetization plateaus. We find that the longitudinal and transverse\nresistivities reflect scattering with both the static and dynamic plateau\nstructure. We model these results consistently with the expected strong\nuniaxial anisotropy in a quantitative level, providing a framework for the\nstudy of plateau states in metallic frustrated systems.\n", "  We identify the bounds on supersymmetric effective operators beyond MSSM,\nfrom heavy diphoton resonance ($X$) negative searches at the LHC, where $X$ is\nidentified with the neutral CP-even (odd) $H$ ($A$) or both (mass degenerate).\nWhile minimal supersymmetric models (MSSM, etc) comply with the data, a leading\neffective operator of $d=6$ can contribute significantly to diphoton production\n$\\sigma\\sim 1$ fb, well above its MSSM value and in conflict with recent data.\nBoth the $b\\bar b$ and $gg$ production mechanisms of $H$ and $A$ can contribute\ncomparably to this. We examine the dependence of the diphoton cross section\n$\\sigma$ on the values of $m_X$, $\\Lambda$ and $\\tan\\beta$, under the\nexperimental constraints from the SM-like higgs couplings $hgg$ and\n$h\\gamma\\gamma$ (due to mixing) and from the $b\\bar b$ and $t\\bar t$ searches.\nThese give $\\Lambda$ larger than $\\sim 5$ TeV for $m_X$ in the range $0.5-1$\nTeV. We show how to generate the $d=6$ effective operator from microscopic\n(renormalizable) models. This demands the presence of vector-like states beyond\nthe MSSM spectrum (and eventually but not necessarily a gauge singlet), of mass\nnear $\\Lambda$ and thus outside the LHC reach.\n", "  We give new proofs of the rationality of the N=1 superconformal minimal model\nvertex operator superalgebras and of the classification of their modules in\nboth the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors. For this, we combine the standard\nfree field realisation with the theory of Jack symmetric functions. A key role\nis played by Jack symmetric polynomials with a certain negative parameter that\nare labelled by admissible partitions. These polynomials are shown to describe\nfree fermion correlators, suitably dressed by a symmetrising factor. The\nclassification proofs concentrate on explicitly identifying Zhu's algebra and\nits twisted analogue. Interestingly, these identifications do not use an\nexplicit expression for the non-trivial vacuum singular vector. While the\nlatter is known to be expressible in terms of an Uglov symmetric polynomial or\na linear combination of Jack superpolynomials, it turns out that standard Jack\npolynomials (and functions) suffice to prove the classification.\n", "  Strong gravitational lensing is regarded as the most precise technique to\nmeasure the mass in the inner region of galaxies or galaxy clusters. In\nparticular, the mass within one Einstein radius can be determined with an\naccuracy of order of a few percent or better, depending on the image\nconfiguration. For other radii, however, degeneracies exist between galaxy\ndensity profiles, precluding an accurate determination of the enclosed mass.\nThe source position transformation (SPT), which includes the well-known\nmass-sheet transformation (MST) as a special case, describes this degeneracy of\nthe lensing observables in a more general way. In this paper we explore\nproperties of an SPT, removing the MST to leading order, i.e., we consider\ndegeneracies which have not been described before. The deflection field\n$\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\alpha}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ resulting from an SPT is not\ncurl-free in general, and thus not a deflection that can be obtained from a\nlensing mass distribution. Starting from a variational principle, we construct\nlensing potentials that give rise to a deflection field\n$\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\alpha}}$, which differs from $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\alpha}}$\nby less than an observationally motivated upper limit. The corresponding mass\ndistributions from these 'valid' SPTs are studied: their radial profiles are\nmodified relative to the original mass distribution in a significant and\nnon-trivial way, and originally axi-symmetric mass distributions can obtain a\nfinite ellipticity. These results indicate a significant effect of the SPT on\nquantitative analyses of lens systems. We show that the mass inside the\nEinstein radius of the original mass distribution is conserved by the SPT;\nhence, as is the case for the MST, the SPT does not affect the mass\ndetermination at the Einstein radius. [...]\n", "  The sources that reionized the universe are still unknown, but likely\ncandidates are faint but numerous galaxies. In this paper we present results\nfrom running a high resolution, uniform volume simulation, the Vulcan, to\npredict the number densities of undetectable, faint galaxies and their escape\nfractions of ionizing radiation, $f_\\mathrm{esc}$, during reionization. Our\napproach combines a high spatial resolution, a realistic treatment of feedback\nand hydro processes, a strict threshold for minimum number of resolution\nelements per galaxy, and a converged measurement of $f_\\mathrm{esc}$. We\ncalibrate our physical model using a novel approach to create realistic\ngalaxies at z=0, so the simulation is predictive at high redshifts. With this\napproach we can (1) robustly predict the evolution of the galaxy UV luminosity\nfunction at faint magnitudes down to $M_\\mathrm{UV}$~-15, two magnitudes\nfainter than observations, and (2) estimate $f_\\mathrm{esc}$ over a large range\nof galaxy masses based on the detailed stellar and gas distributions in\nresolved galaxies. We find steep faint end slopes, implying high number\ndensities of faint galaxies, and the dependence of $f_\\mathrm{esc}$ on the UV\nmagnitude of a galaxy, given by the power-law: log $f_\\mathrm{esc} = (0.51 \\pm\n0.04)M_\\mathrm{UV} + 7.3 \\pm 0.8$, with the faint population having\n$f_\\mathrm{esc}$~35%. Convolving the UV luminosity function with\n$f_\\mathrm{esc}$($M_\\mathrm{UV}$), we find an ionizing emissivity that is (1)\ndominated by the faintest galaxies and (2) reionizes the universe at the\nappropriate rate, consistent with observational constraints of the ionizing\nemissivity and the optical depth to the decoupling surface tau_es, without the\nneed for additional sources of ionizing radiation.\n", "  This document presents a studies of the stochastic behavior of D-Wave qubits,\nqubit cells, and qubit chains. The purpose of this paper is to address the\nalgorithmic behavior of execution rather than the physical behavior, though\nthey are related. The measurements from an actual D-Wave adiabatic quantum\ncomputer are compare with calculated measurements from a theoretical adiabatic\nquantum computer running with an effective temperature of zero. In this way the\npaper attempts to shed light on how the D-Wave's behavior effects how well it\nminimizes its objective function and why the D-Wave performs as it does.\n", "  We report on the observation of the coherent enhancement of the return\nprobability (\"enhanced return to the origin\" , ERO) in a periodically kicked\ncold-atom gas. By submitting an atomic wave packet to a pulsed, periodically\nshifted laser standing wave, we induce an oscillation of ERO in time and\nexplain it in terms of a periodic, reversible dephasing in the\nweak-localization interference sequences responsible for ERO. Monitoring the\ntemporal decay of ERO, we exploit its quantum coherent nature to quantify the\ndecoherence rate of the atomic system.\n", "  We demonstrate that observations lacking reliable redshift information, such\nas photometric and radio continuum surveys, can produce robust measurements of\ncosmological parameters when empowered by clustering-based redshift estimation.\nThis method infers the redshift distribution based on the spatial clustering of\nsources, using cross-correlation with a reference dataset with known redshifts.\nApplying this method to the existing SDSS photometric galaxies, and projecting\nto future radio continuum surveys, we show that sources can be efficiently\ndivided into several redshift bins, increasing their ability to constrain\ncosmological parameters. We forecast constraints on the dark-energy\nequation-of-state and on local non-gaussianity parameters. We explore several\npertinent issues, including the tradeoff between including more sources versus\nminimizing the overlap between bins, the shot-noise limitations on binning, and\nthe predicted performance of the method at high redshifts. Remarkably, we find\nthat, once this technique is implemented, constraints on dynamical dark energy\nfrom the SDSS imaging catalog can be competitive with, or better than, those\nfrom the spectroscopic BOSS survey and even future planned experiments.\nFurther, constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from future large-sky\nradio-continuum surveys can outperform those from the Planck CMB experiment,\nand rival those from future spectroscopic galaxy surveys. The application of\nthis method thus holds tremendous promise for cosmology.\n", "  We compute the expected X-ray diffuse background and radiative feedback on\nthe intergalactic medium (IGM) from X-ray binaries prior and during the epoch\nof reionization. The cosmic evolution of compact binaries is followed using a\npopulation synthesis technique that treats separately neutron stars and black\nhole binaries in different spectral states and is calibrated to reproduce the\nobserved X-ray properties of galaxies at z<4. Together with an updated\nempirical determination of the cosmic history of star formation, recent\nmodeling of the stellar mass-metallicity relation, and a scheme for absorption\nby the IGM that accounts for the presence of ionized HII bubbles during the\nepoch of reionization, our detailed calculations provide refined predictions of\nthe X-ray volume emissivity and filtered radiation background from \"normal\"\ngalaxies at z>6. Radiative transfer effects modulate the background spectrum,\nwhich shows a characteristic peak between 1 and 2 keV. While the filtering of\nX-ray radiation through the IGM slightly increases the mean excess energy per\nphotoionization, it also weakens the radiation intensity below 1 keV, lowering\nthe mean photoionization and heating rates. Numerical integration of the rate\nand energy equations shows that the contribution of X-ray binaries to the\nionization of the bulk IGM is negligible, with the electron fraction never\nexceeding 1%. Direct HeI photoionizations are the main source of IGM heating,\nand the temperature of the largely neutral medium in between HII cavities\nincreases above the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) only\nat z<10, when the volume filling factor of HII bubbles is already >0.1.\nTherefore, in this scenario, it is only at relatively late epochs that the bulk\nof neutral intergalactic hydrogen may be observable in 21-cm emission against\nthe CMB.\n", "  We present an analysis of the flow of metals through the circumgalactic\nmedium (CGM) in the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations of\ngalaxy formation, ranging from isolated dwarfs to $L*$ galaxies. We find that\nnearly all metals produced in high-redshift galaxies are carried out in winds\nthat reach $0.25 R_{\\rm vir}$. When measured at $0.25 R_{\\rm vir}$ the\nmetallicity of outflows is slightly higher than the interstellar medium (ISM)\nmetallicity. Many metals thus reside in the CGM. Cooling and recycling from\nthis reservoir determine the metal budget in the ISM. The outflowing metal flux\ndecreases by a factor of $\\sim2-5$ between $0.25 R_{\\rm vir}$ and $R_{\\rm\nvir}$. Furthermore, outflow metallicity is typically lower at $R_{\\rm vir}$\nowing to dilution of the remaining outflow by metal-poor material swept up from\nthe CGM. The inflow metallicity at $R_{\\rm vir}$ is generally low, but outflow\nand inflow metallicities are similar in the inner halo. At low redshift,\nmassive galaxies no longer generate outflows that reach the CGM, causing a\ndivergence in CGM and ISM metallicity. Dwarf galaxies continue to generate\noutflows, although they preferentially retain metal ejecta. In all but the\nleast massive galaxy considered, a majority of the metals are within the halo\nat $z=0$. We measure the fraction of metals in CGM, ISM and stars, and quantify\nthe thermal state of CGM metals in each halo. The total amount of metals in the\nlow-redshift CGM of two simulated $L*$ galaxies is consistent with estimates\nfrom the COS halos survey, while for the other two it appears to be lower.\n", "  What exactly is Dark Matter? New theories for what really constitutes Dark\nMatter appear to make the news headlines every week. At a slower pace, these\ntheories are slowly being eliminated. We revisit this scientific thriller and\nmake the case that condensed neutrino matter is a leading suspect. We provide a\nforensic discussion of some subtle evidence and show that independent\nexperimental results due out in 2019 from the KATRIN experiment will either be\nthe definitive result or eliminate condensed neutrinos as a Dark Matter\ncandidate.\n", "  We apply two Bayesian hierarchical inference schemes to infer shear power\nspectra, shear maps and cosmological parameters from the CFHTLenS weak lensing\nsurvey - the first application of this method to data. In the first approach,\nwe sample the joint posterior distribution of the shear maps and power spectra\nby Gibbs sampling, with minimal model assumptions. In the second approach, we\nsample the joint posterior of the shear maps and cosmological parameters,\nproviding a new, accurate and principled approach to cosmological parameter\ninference from cosmic shear data. As a first demonstration on data we perform a\n2-bin tomographic analysis to constrain cosmological parameters and investigate\nthe possibility of photometric redshift bias in the CFHTLenS data. Under the\nbaseline $\\Lambda$CDM model we constrain $S_8 =\n\\sigma_8(\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.67 ^{\\scriptscriptstyle+ 0.03\n}_{\\scriptscriptstyle- 0.03 }$ $(68\\%)$, consistent with previous CFHTLenS\nanalysis but in tension with Planck. Adding neutrino mass as a free parameter\nwe are able to constrain $\\sum m_\\nu < 4.6\\mathrm{eV}$ (95%) using CFHTLenS\ndata alone. Including a linear redshift dependent photo-$z$ bias $\\Delta z =\np_2(z - p_1)$, we find $p_1=-0.25 ^{\\scriptscriptstyle+ 0.53\n}_{\\scriptscriptstyle- 0.60 }$ and $p_2 = -0.15 ^{\\scriptscriptstyle+ 0.17\n}_{\\scriptscriptstyle- 0.15 }$, and tension with Planck is only alleviated\nunder very conservative prior assumptions. Neither the non-minimal neutrino\nmass or photo-$z$ bias models are significantly preferred by the CFHTLenS\n(2-bin tomography) data.\n", "  At the Hamburger Sternwarte an effort was started in 2010 with the aim of\ndigitizing its more than 45000 photographic plates and films stored in its\nplate archives. At the time of writing, more than 31000 plates have already\nbeen made available on the Internet for researchers, historians, as well as for\nthe interested public. The digitization process and the Internet presentation\nof the plates and accompanying hand written material (plate envelopes,\nlogbooks, observer notes) are presented here. To fully exploit the unique\nphotometric and astrometric data, stored on the plates, further processing\nsteps are required including registering the plate to celestial coordinates,\nmasking of the plates, and a calibration of the photo-emulsion darkening curve.\nTo demonstrate the correct functioning of these procedures, historical light\ncurves of two bright BL Lac type active galactic nuclei are extracted. The\nresulting light curve of the blazar 1ES 1215+303 exhibits a large decrease in\nthe magnitude from $14.25^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ to $15.94^{+0.09}_{-0.13}$ in about\n300 days, which proves the variability in the optical region. Furthermore, we\ncompare the measured magnitudes for the quasar 3C~273 with contemporaneous\nmeasurements.\n", "  Artificial neural network (ANN) is tested as a tool for finding a new subgrid\nmodel of the subgrid-scale (SGS) stress in large-eddy simulation. ANN is used\nto establish a functional relation between the grid-scale (GS) flow field and\nthe SGS stress without any assumption of the form of function. Data required\nfor training and test of ANN are provided by direct numerical simulation (DNS)\nof a turbulent channel flow. It is shown that ANN can establish a model similar\nto the gradient model. The correlation coefficients between the real SGS stress\nand the output of ANN are comparable to or larger than similarity models, but\nsmaller than a two-parameter dynamic mixed model.\n", "  The recently published Yemeni observing report about SN 1006 from al-Yamani\nclearly gives AD 1006 Apr $17 \\pm 2$ (mid-Rajab 396h) as first observation\ndate. Since this is about 1.5 weeks earlier than the otherwise earliest reports\n(Apr 28 or 30) as discussed so far, we were motivated to investigate an early\nsighting in more depth. We searched for additional evidences from other areas\nlike East Asia and Europe. We found that the date given by al-Yamani is fully\nconsistent with other evidence, including: (a) SN 1006 \"rose several times half\nan hour after sunset\" (al-Yamani), which is correct for the location of Sana in\nYemen for the time around Apr 17, but it would not be correct for late Apr or\nearly May; (b) the date (3rd year, 3rd lunar month, 28th day wuzi, Ichidai\nYoki) for an observation of a guest star in Japan is inconsistent (there is no\nday wuzi in that lunar month), but may be dated to Apr 16 by reading wuwu date\nrather than a wuzi date; (c) there is observational evidence that SN 1006 was\nobserved in East Asia early or mid April; for the second half of April, a bad\nweather (early monsoon) period is not unlikely -- there is a lack of night\nreports; (d) the observer in St. Gallen reported to have seen SN 1006 \"for\nthree months\", which must have ended at the very latest on AD 1006 Jul 10,\ngiven his northern location, so that his observations probably started in\nApril. We conclude that the correctly reported details give quite high\nconfidence in the fully self-consistent report of al-Yamani, so that the early\ndiscovery date should be considered seriously.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of $qq^\\prime \\bar b \\bar b$ tetraquark bound\nstates using $n_f=2+1$ lattice QCD ensembles with pion masses $\\simeq 164$,\n$299$, and $415$ MeV. Motivated by observations from heavy baryon\nphenomenology, we consider two lattice interpolating operators both of which\nare expected to couple efficiently to tetraquark states: one with\ndiquark-antidiquark and one with a meson-meson structure. Using nonrelativistic\nQCD to simulate the bottom quarks, we study the $ud\\bar b \\bar b$, $\\ell s\\bar\nb \\bar b$ channels with $\\ell=u,d$, and find unambiguous signals for\nstrong-interaction-stable $J^P=1^+$ tetraquarks. These states are found to lie\n$189(10)$ and $98(7)$ MeV below the corresponding free two-meson thresholds.\n", "  We intensively studied the flare activity on the stellar object KIC011764567.\nThe star was thought to be solar type, with a temperature of $T_{eff} = (5640\n\\pm 200)\\,$K, $\\log(g) = (4.3 \\pm 0.3)\\,$dex and a rotational period of Prot 22\nd (Brown et al. 2011). High resolution spectra turn the target to an evolved\nobject with Teff = (5300 \\pm 150) K, a metalicity of $[m/H] = (-0.5 \\pm 0.2)$,\na surface gravity of $log(g) = (3.3 \\pm 0.4)\\,$dex, and a projected rotational\nvelocity of $v sin i = (22 \\pm 1)\\,kms^{-1}$. Within an observing time span of\n4 years we detected 150 flares in Kepler data in an energy range of $10^{36} -\n10^{37}$ erg. From a dynamical Lomb-Scargle periodogram we have evidence for\ndifferential rotation as well as for stellar spot evolution and migration.\nAnalysing the occurrence times of the flares we found hints for a periodic\nflare frequency cycle of $430 - 460 $d, the significance increases with an\nincreasing threshold of the flares equivalent duration. One explanation is a\nvery short activity cycle of the star with that period. Another possibility,\nalso proposed by others in similar cases, is that the larger flares may be\ntriggered by external phenomena, such as magnetically interaction with an\nunseen companion. Our high resolution spectra show that KIC011764567 is not a\nshort period binary star.\n", "  A new off-shelf low-cost echelle spectrograph was installed recently on the\n0.6m telescope at the Star\\'a Lesn\\'a Observatory (Slovakia). In this paper we\ndescribe in details the radial velocity (RV) analysis of the first three\ntransiting planetary systems, HAT-P-2, WASP-14 and XO-3, observed with this\ninstrument. Furthermore, we compare our data with the RV data achieved with\nechelle spectrographs of other sub-meter-, meter- and two-meter-class\ntelescopes in terms of their precision. Finally, we investigate the\napplicability of our RV data for modeling orbital parameters.\n", "  Using observations of sunspot magnetic field strengths (H) from the Crimean\nAstrophysical Observatory (CrAO) and area (S) of sunspots from the Kislovodsk\nMountain Astronomical Station of Pulkovo Observatory, we investigate the\nchanges in the relation between H and S over the period of about two solar\ncycles (1994-2013). The data were fitted by H = A + B log S, where A =\n(778+/-46) and B = (778+/-25). We show that the correlation between H and S\nvaries with the phase of solar cycle, and $A$ coefficient decreases\nsignificantly after year 2001, while B coefficient does not change\nsignificantly. Furthermore, our data confirm the presence of two distinct\npopulations in distribution of sunspots (small sunspots with weaker field\nstrength and large sunspots with stronger field). We show that relative\ncontribution of each component to the distribution of sunspots by their area\nchanges with the phase of solar cycle and on longer-then-cycle periods. We\ninterpret these changes as a signature of a long-term (centennial) variations\nin properties of sunspots.\n", "  We report the orbital distribution of the Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)\ndiscovered during the High Ecliptic Latitude (HiLat) extension of the\nCanada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey (CFEPS), conducted from June 2006 to July\n2009. The HiLat component was designed to address one of the shortcomings of\necliptic surveys (like CFEPS), their lack of sensitivity to high-inclination\nobjects. We searched 701~deg$^2$ of sky ranging from 12$^\\circ$ to 85$^\\circ$\necliptic latitude and discovered \\lKBO TNOs, with inclinations between\n15$^\\circ$ to 104$^\\circ$. This survey places a very strong constraint on the\ninclination distribution of the hot component of the classical Kuiper Belt,\nruling out any possibility of a large intrinsic fraction of highly inclined\norbits. Using the parameterization of \\citet{2001AJ....121.2804B}, the HiLat\nsample combined with CFEPS imposes a width $14^\\circ \\le \\sigma \\le\n15.5^\\circ$, with a best match for $\\sigma = 14.5^\\circ$. HiLat discovered the\nfirst retrograde TNO, 2008~KV$_{42}$, with an almost polar orbit with\ninclination 104$^\\circ$, and (418993), a scattering object with perihelion in\nthe region of Saturn's influence, with $a \\sim 400$~AU and $i = 68^\\circ$.\n", "  We describe a variational theory of multi-band two-dimensional electron gases\nthat captures the interplay between electrostatic confining potentials,\norbital-dependent interlayer electronic hopping and electron-electron\ninteractions, and apply it to the d-band two-dimensional electron gases that\nform near perovskite oxide surfaces and heterojunctions. These multi-band\ntwo-dimensional electron gases are prone to the formation of\nCoulomb-interaction-driven orbitally-ordered nematic ground-states. We find\nthat as the electron density is lowered and interaction effects strengthen,\nspontaneous orbital order occurs first, followed by spin order. We compare our\nresults with known properties of single-component two-dimensional electron gas\nsystems and comment on closely related physics in semiconductor quantum wells\nand van der Waals heterostructures.\n", "  Context: Debris disks are important observational clues for understanding\nplanetary-system formation process. In particular, faint warm debris disks may\nbe related to late planet formation near 1 AU. A systematic search of faint\nwarm debris disks is necessary to reveal terrestrial planet formation. Aims:\nFaint warm debris disks show excess emission that peaks at mid-IR wavelengths.\nThus we explore debris disks using the AKARI mid-IR all-sky point source\ncatalog (PSC), a product of the second generation unbiased IR all-sky survey.\nMethods : We investigate IR excess emission for 678 isolated main-sequence\nstars for which there are 18 micron detections in the AKARI mid-IR all-sky\ncatalog by comparing their fluxes with the predicted fluxes of the photospheres\nbased on optical to near-IR fluxes and model spectra. The near-IR fluxes are\nfirst taken from the 2MASS PSC. However, 286 stars with Ks<4.5 in our sample\nhave large flux errors in the 2MASS photometry due to saturation. Thus we have\nmeasured accurate J, H, and Ks band fluxes, applying neutral density (ND)\nfilters for Simultaneous InfraRed Imager for Unbiased Survey (SIRIUS) on IRSF,\nthe \\phi 1.4 m near-IR telescope in South Africa, and improved the flux\naccuracy from 14% to 1.8% on average. Results: We identified 53 debris-disk\ncandidates including eight new detections from our sample of 678 main-sequence\nstars. The detection rate of debris disks for this work is ~8%, which is\ncomparable with those in previous works by Spitzer and Herschel. Conclusion:\nThe importance of this study is the detection of faint warm debris disks around\nnearby field stars. At least nine objects have a large amount of dust for their\nages, which cannot be explained by the conventional steady-state collisional\ncascade model.\n", "  We study the thermal conductance across solid-solid interfaces as the\ncomposition of an intermediate matching layer is varied. In absence of\nphonon-phonon interactions, an added layer can make the interfacial conductance\nincrease or decrease depending on the interplay between (1) an increase in\nphonon transmission due to better bridging between the contacts, and (2) a\ndecrease in the number of available conduction channels that must conserve\ntheir momenta transverse to the interface. When phonon-phonon interactions are\nincluded, the added layer is seen to aid conductance when the decrease in\nresistances at the contact-layer boundaries compensate for the additional layer\nresistance. For the particular systems explored in this work, the maximum\nconductance happens when the layer mass is close to the geometric mean of the\ncontact masses. The surprising result, usually associated with coherent\nantireflection coatings, follows from a monotonic increase in the boundary\nresistance with the interface mass ratio. This geometric mean condition readily\nextends to a compositionally graded interfacial layer with an exponentially\nvarying mass that generates the thermal equivalent of a broadband impedance\nmatching network.\n", "  Herbert Simon's classic rich-get-richer model is one of the simplest\nempirically supported mechanisms capable of generating heavy-tail size\ndistributions for complex systems. Simon argued analytically that a population\nof flavored elements growing by either adding a novel element or randomly\nreplicating an existing one would afford a distribution of group sizes with a\npower-law tail. Here, we show that, in fact, Simon's model does not produce a\nsimple power law size distribution as the initial element has a dominant\nfirst-mover advantage, and will be overrepresented by a factor proportional to\nthe inverse of the innovation probability. The first group's size discrepancy\ncannot be explained away as a transient of the model, and may therefore be many\norders of magnitude greater than expected. We demonstrate how Simon's analysis\nwas correct but incomplete, and expand our alternate analysis to quantify the\nvariability of long term rankings for all groups. We find that the expected\ntime for a first replication is infinite, and show how an incipient group must\nbreak the mechanism to improve their odds of success. We present an example of\ncitation counts for a specific field that demonstrates a first-mover advantage\nconsistent with our revised view of the rich-get-richer mechanism. Our findings\ncall for a reexamination of preceding work invoking Simon's model and provide\nan expanded understanding going forward.\n", "  Testing predictions of semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution against\nobservations help to understand the complex processes that shape galaxies. We\ncompare predictions from the Garching and Durham models implemented on the\nMillennium Run with observations of galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) and\ngalaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing (G3L) for various galaxy samples with stellar\nmasses in the range 0.5 < (M_* / 10^10 M_Sun) < 32 and photometric redshift\nrange 0.2 < z < 0.6 in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey\n(CFHTLenS). We find that the predicted GGL and G3L signals are in qualitative\nagreement with CFHTLenS data. Quantitatively, the models succeed in reproducing\nthe observed signals in the highest stellar mass bin (16 < ( M_* / 10^10 M_Sun)\n< 32) but show different degrees of tension for the other stellar mass samples.\nThe Durham models are strongly excluded at the 95% confidence level by the\nobservations as they largely over-predict the amplitudes of the GGL and G3L\nsignals, probably because they predict too many satellite galaxies in massive\nhalos.\n", "  We study the smallest non-trivial matrix model that can be considered to be a\n(toy) model of a black hole. The model consists of a pair of $2\\times 2$\ntraceless hermitian matrices with a commutator squared potential and an $SU(2)$\ngauge symmetry, plus an $SO(2)$ rotation symmetry. We show that using the\nsymmetries of the system, all but two of the variables can be separated. The\ntwo variables that remain display chaos and a transition from chaos to\nintegrability when a parameter related to an $SO(2)$ angular momentum is tuned\nto a critical value. We compute the Lyapunov exponents near this transition and\nstudy the critical exponent of the Lyapunov exponents near the critical point.\nWe compare this transition to extremal rotating black holes.\n", "  We vary the time-frequency mode structure of ultrafast pulse-pumped\nmodulational instability (MI) twin beams in an argon-filled hollow-core\nkagom\\'e-style PCF by adjusting the pressure, pump pulse chirp, fiber length\nand parametric gain. Compared to solid-core systems, the pressure dependent\ndispersion landscape brings increased flexibility to the tailoring of frequency\ncorrelations and we demonstrate that the pump pulse chirp can be used to tune\nthe joint spectrum of femtosecond-pumped sources. We also characterize the\nresulting mode content, not only by measuring the multimode second-order\ncorrelation function g(2) but also by directly reconstructing the shapes and\nweights of time-frequency Schmidt (TFS) modes. We show that the number of modes\ndirectly influences the shot-to-shot pulse-energy and spectral-shape\nfluctuations in MI. Using this approach we control and monitor the number of\nTFS modes within the range from 1.3 to 4 using only a single fiber.\n", "  Measurements of the relaxation of a zonal electrostatic potential\nperturbation in a non-axisymmetric magnetically confined plasma are presented.\nA sudden perturbation of the plasma equilibrium is induced by the injection of\na cryogenic hydrogen pellet in the TJ-II stellarator, which is observed to be\nfollowed by a damped oscillation in the electrostatic potential. The waveform\nof the relaxation is consistent with theoretical calculations of zonal\npotential relaxation in a non-axisymmetric magnetic geometry. The turbulent\ntransport properties of a magnetic confinement configuration are expected to\ndepend on the features of the collisionless damping of zonal flows, of which\nthe present letter is the first direct observation.\n", "  Magnonic crystals with locally alternating properties and specific\nperiodicities exhibit interesting effects, such as a multitude of different\nspin-wave states and large band gaps. This work aims for demonstrating and\nunderstanding the key role of local demagnetizing fields in such systems. To\nachieve this, hybrid structures are investigated consisting of a continuous\nthin film with a stripe modulation on top favorable due to the adjustability of\nthe magnonic effects with the modulation size. For a direct access to the spin\ndynamics, a magnonic crystal was reconstructed from `bottom-up', i.e., the\nstructural shape as well as the internal field landscape of the structure were\nexperimentally obtained on the nanoscale using electron holography.\nSubsequently, both properties were utilized to perform dynamic response\ncalculations. The simulations yield the frequency-field dependence as well as\nthe angular dependence of spin waves in a magnonic crystal and reveal the\ngoverning role of the internal field landscape around the backward-volume\ngeometry. The complex angle-dependent spin-wave behavior is described for a 360\ndegree in-plane rotation of an external field by connecting the internal field\nlandscape with the individual spin-wave localization.\n", "  We introduce the concept of fidelity for dynamical maps in an open quantum\nsystem scenario. We derive an inequality linking this quantity to the\ndistinguishability of the inducing environmental states. Our inequality imposes\nconstraints on the allowed set of dynamical maps arising from the microscopic\ndescription of system plus environment. Remarkably, the inequality involves\nonly the states of the environment and the dynamical map of the open system\nand, therefore, does not rely on the knowledge of either the microscopic\ninteraction Hamiltonian or the environmental Hamiltonian characteristic\nparameters. We demonstrate the power of our result by applying it to two\ndifferent scenarios: quantum programming and quantum probing. In the first case\nwe use it to derive bounds on the dimension of the processor for approximate\nprogramming of unitaries. In the second case we present an intriguing\nproof-of-principle demonstration of the ability to extract information on the\nenvironment via a quantum probe without any a priori assumption on the form of\nthe system-environment coupling Hamiltonian.\n", "  Mean-field-based Lagrangian framework is developed for the fluid turbulence\ntheory. The space- time vector flow is naturally introduced from the mean\nvelocity, which provides the Lagrangian picture based on the mean field in\ntotally equivalent manner to that of the instantaneous field. The proposed\nframework is applied, on one hand, to one-point closure model, yielding an\nobjective expression of the turbulence visco-elastic effect. Application to\ntwo-point closure, on the other hand, is also discussed, where natural\nextension of known Lagrangian correlation is discovered on the basis of\nextended covariance group.\n", "  We study the non-Gaussian dynamics of a quasiclassical electronic circuit\ninductively coupled to a mesoscopic conductor. Non-Gaussian noise accompanying\nthe nonequilibrium transport through the conductor significantly modifies the\nsteady-state probability density function (PDF) of the flux in the dissipative\ncircuit. We evaluate the quantum correction of the steady-state PDF by\nincorporating the quantum fluctuation of the circuit. The inverse formula to\ninfer the statistical properties of the non-Gaussian noise from the\nsteady-state PDF is extended to the classical-quantum crossover regime.\n", "  No.\n", "  Future astrophysics and cosmic microwave background space missions operating\nin the far-infrared to millimetre part of the spectrum will require very large\narrays of ultra-sensitive detectors in combination with high multiplexing\nfactors and efficient low-noise and low-power readout systems. We have\ndeveloped a demonstrator system suitable for such applications. The system\ncombines a 961 pixel imaging array based upon Microwave Kinetic Inductance\nDetectors (MKIDs) with a readout system capable of reading out all pixels\nsimultaneously with only one readout cable pair and a single cryogenic\namplifier. We evaluate, in a representative environment, the system performance\nin terms of sensitivity, dynamic range, optical efficiency, cosmic ray\nrejection, pixel-pixel crosstalk and overall yield at at an observation centre\nfrequency of 850 GHz and 20% fractional bandwidth. The overall system has an\nexcellent sensitivity, with an average detector sensitivity NEPdet=3x10^-19\nW/rt(Hz) measured using a thermal calibration source. At a loading power per\npixel of 50fW we demonstrate white, photon noise limited detector noise down to\n300 mHz. The dynamic range would allow the detection of 1 Jy bright sources\nwithin the field of view without tuning the readout of the detectors. The\nexpected dead time due to cosmic ray interactions, when operated in an L2 or a\nsimilar far-Earth orbit, is found to be <4%. Additionally, the achieved pixel\nyield is 83% and the crosstalk between the pixels is <-30dB. This demonstrates\nthat MKID technology can provide multiplexing ratios on the order of a 1000\nwith state-of-the-art single pixel performance, and that the technology is now\nmature enough to be considered for future space based observatories and\nexperiments.\n", "  The orbits, atmospheric parameters, chemical abundances, and ages of\nindividual stars in the Milky Way provide the most comprehensive illustration\nof galaxy formation available. The Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) will\ndeliver astrometric parameters for the largest ever sample of Milky Way stars,\nthough its full potential cannot be realized without the addition of\ncomplementary spectroscopy. Among existing spectroscopic surveys, the RAdial\nVelocity Experiment (RAVE) has the largest overlap with TGAS ($\\gtrsim$200,000\nstars). We present a data-driven re-analysis of 520,781 RAVE spectra using The\nCannon. For red giants, we build our model using high-fidelity APOGEE stellar\nparameters and abundances for stars that overlap with RAVE. For main-sequence\nand sub-giant stars, our model uses stellar parameters from the K2/EPIC. We\nderive and validate effective temperature $T_{\\rm eff}$, surface gravity\n$\\log{g}$, and chemical abundances of up to seven elements (O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca,\nFe, Ni). We report a total of 1,685,851 elemental abundances with a typical\nprecision of 0.07 dex, a substantial improvement over previous RAVE data\nreleases. The synthesis of RAVE-on and TGAS is the most powerful data set for\nchemo-dynamic analyses of the Milky Way ever produced.\n", "  Symplectic integrators for Hamiltonian systems have been quite successful for\nstudying few-body dynamical systems. These integrators are frequently derived\nusing a formalism built on symplectic maps. There have been recent efforts to\nextend the symplectic approach to plasmas, which have focused primarily on\ndiscrete Lagrangian mechanics. In this paper, we derive a a symplectic\nelectromagnetic macroparticle algorithm using the map formalism. The resulting\nalgorithm is designed to prevent numerical instabilities such as numerical\n\\v{C}erenkov, which result from incorrect dispersion relations for the fields,\nas well as the artificial heating of plasmas, which arise from the\nnon-symplectic nature of conventional particle-in-cell algorithms. This is the\nfirst self-consistent electromagnetic algorithm derived using a map-based\napproach.\n", "  15 years of XMM-Newton observations have established that ultra-fast, highly\nionized winds are common in radio-quiet AGN. A simple theory of\nEddington-limited accretion correctly predicts the typical velocity (~0.1c) and\nhigh ionization of such winds, with observed flow energy capable of ejecting\nstar-forming gas. With a recent extended XMM-Newton observation of the\narchetypal UFO, PG1211+143, revealing a more complex flow pattern, we suggest\nthat targetted observations over the next decade offer unique potential for\nprobing the inner accretion disc structure and SMBH growth.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss P(n), the number of ways in which a given integer n\nmay be written as a sum of primes. In particular, an asymptotic form P_as(n)\nvalid for n towards infinity is obtained analytically using standard techniques\nof quantum statistical mechanics. First, the bosonic partition function of\nprimes, or the generating function of unrestricted prime partitions in number\ntheory, is constructed. Next, the density of states is obtained using the\nsaddle-point method for Laplace inversion of the partition function in the\nlimit of large n. This directly gives the asymptotic number of prime partitions\nP_as(n). The leading term in the asymptotic expression grows exponentially as\nsqrt[n/ln(n)] and agrees with previous estimates. We calculate the\nnext-to-leading order term in the exponent, porportional to ln[ln(n)]/ln(n),\nand show that an earlier result in the literature for its coefficient is\nincorrect. Furthermore, we also calculate the next higher order correction,\nproportional to 1/ln(n) and given in Eq.(43), which so far has not been\navailable in the literature. Finally, we compare our analytical results with\nthe exact numerical values of P(n) up to n \\sim 8 10^6. For the highest values,\nthe remaining error between the exact P(n) and our P_as(n) is only about half\nof that obtained with the leading-order (LO) approximation. But we also show\nthat, unlike for other types of partitions, the asymptotic limit for the prime\npartitions is still quite far from being reached even for n \\sim 10^7.\n", "  We study the shock waves in relativistic chiral matter. We argue that the\nconventional Rankine-Hugoinot relations are modified due to the presence of\nchiral transport phenomena. We show that the entropy discontinuity in a weak\nshock wave is quadratic in the pressure discontinuity when the effect of chiral\ntransport becomes sufficiently large. We also show that rarefaction shock\nwaves, which do not exist in usual nonchiral fluids, can appear in chiral\nmatter. The direction of shock wave propagation in a vorticity is found to be\ncompletely determined by the direction of the vorticity and the chirality of\nfermions. These features are exemplified by shock propagation in dense neutrino\nmatter in the hydrodynamic regime.\n", "  We consider the effect of electron-electron interactions on a voltage biased\nquantum point contact in the tunneling regime used as a detector of a nearby\nqubit. We model the leads of the quantum point contact as Luttinger liquids,\nincorporate the effects of finite temperature and analyze the detection-induced\ndecoherence rate and the detector efficiency, $Q$. We find that interactions\ngenerically reduce the induced decoherence along with the detector's\nefficiency, and strongly affect the relative strength of the decoherence\ninduced by tunneling and that induced by interactions with the local density.\nWith increasing interaction strength, the regime of quantum-limited detection\n($Q=1$) is shifted to increasingly lower temperatures or higher bias voltages\nrespectively. For small to moderate interaction strengths, $Q$ is a\nmonotonously decreasing function of temperature as in the non-interacting case.\nSurprisingly, for sufficiently strong interactions we identify an intermediate\ntemperature regime where the efficiency of the detector increases with rising\ntemperature.\n", "  We classify interacting topological insulators and superconductors with\norder-two crystal symmetries (reflection and twofold rotation), focusing on the\ncase where interactions reduce the noninteracting classification. We find that\nthe free-fermion $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ classifications are stable against quartic\ncontact interactions, whereas the $\\mathbb{Z}$ classifications reduce to\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$, where $N$ depends on the symmetry class and the dimension $d$.\nThese results are derived using a quantum nonlinear $\\sigma$ model (QNLSM) that\ndescribes the effects of the quartic interactions on the boundary modes of the\ncrystalline topological phases. We use Clifford algebra extensions to derive\nthe target spaces of these QNLSMs in a unified way. The reduction pattern of\nthe free-fermion classification then follows from the presence or absence of\ntopological terms in the QNLSMs, which is determined by the homotopy group of\nthe target spaces. We show that this derivation can be performed using either a\ncomplex fermion or a real Majorana representation of the crystalline\ntopological phases and demonstrate that these two representations give\nconsistent results. To illustrate the breakdown of the noninteracting\nclassification we present examples of crystalline topological insulators and\nsuperconductors in dimensions one, two, and three, whose surfaces modes are\nunstable against interactions. For the three-dimensional example, we show that\nthe reduction pattern obtained by the QNLSM method agrees with the one inferred\nfrom the stability analysis of the boundary modes using bosonization.\n", "  We briefly review how X-ray observations of high-redshift active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs) at z = 4-7 have played a critical role in understanding their\nbasic demographics as well as their physical processes; e.g., absorption by\nnuclear material and winds, accretion rates, and jet emission. We point out\nsome key remaining areas of uncertainty, highlighting where further Chandra and\nXMM-Newton observations/analyses, combined with new multiwavelength survey\ndata, can advance understanding over the next decade.\n", "  We solve the Schr\\\"odinger equation with a position-dependent mass (PDM)\ncharged particle interacted via the superposition of the Morse and Coulomb\npotentials and exposed to external magnetic and Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux fields.\nThe non-relativistic bound state energies together with their wave functions\nare calculated for two spatially-dependent mass distribution functions. We also\nstudy the thermal quantities of such a system. Further, the canonical formalism\nis used to compute various thermodynamic variables for second choosing mass by\nusing the Gibbs formalism. We give plots for energy as a function of various\nphysical parameters. The behavior of the internal energy, specific heat and\nentropy as functions of temperature and mass density parameter in the\ninverse-square mass case for different values of magnetic field are shown.\n", "  Understanding of the observed structure in the universe can be reached only\nin the theoretical framework of dark matter. N-body simulations are\nindispensable for the analysis of the formation and evolution of the dark\nmatter web. Two primary fields - density and velocity fields - are used in most\nof studies. However dark matter provides two additional fields which are unique\nfor collisionless media only. These are the multi- stream field in Eulerian\nspace and flip-flop field in Lagrangian space. The flip-flop field represents\nthe number of sign reversals of an elementary volume of each collisionless\nfluid element. This field can be estimated by counting the sign reversals of\nthe Jacobian at each particle at every time step of the simulation. The\nJacobian is evaluated by numerical differentiation of the Lagrangian\nsubmanifold, i.e., the three-dimensional dark matter sheet in the\nsix-dimensional space formed by three Lagrangian and three Eulerian\ncoordinates. We present the results of the statistical study of the evolution\nof the flip-flop field from z = 50 to the present time z = 0. A number of\nstatistical characteristics show that the pattern of the flip-flop field\nremains remarkably stable from z = 30 to the present time. As a result the\nflip-flop field evaluated at z = 0 stores a wealth of information about the\ndynamical history of the dark matter web. In particular one of the most\nintriguing properties of the flip-flop is a unique capability to preserve the\ninformation about the merging history of dark matter haloes.\n", "  Binary star systems are important for understanding stellar structure and\nevolution, and are especially useful when oscillations can be detected and\nanalysed with asteroseismology. However, only four systems are known in which\nsolar-like oscillations are detected in both components. Here, we analyse the\nfifth such system, HD 176465, which was observed by Kepler. We carefully\nanalysed the system's power spectrum to measure individual mode frequencies,\nadapting our methods where necessary to accommodate the fact that both stars\noscillate in a similar frequency range. We also modelled the two stars\nindependently by fitting stellar models to the frequencies and complementary\nparameters. We are able to cleanly separate the oscillation modes in both\nsystems. The stellar models produce compatible ages and initial compositions\nfor the stars, as is expected from their common and contemporaneous origin.\nCombining the individual ages, the system is about 3.0$\\pm$0.5 Gyr old. The two\ncomponents of HD 176465 are young physically-similar oscillating solar\nanalogues, the first such system to be found, and provide important constraints\nfor stellar evolution and asteroseismology.\n", "  Given a preferred orthonormal basis $B$ in the Hilbert space of a quantum\nsystem we define a measure of the coherence generating power of a unitary\noperation with respect to $B$. This measure is the average coherence generated\nby the operation acting on a uniform ensemble of incoherent states. We give its\nexplicit analytical form in any dimension and provide an operational protocol\nto directly detect it. We characterize the set of unitaries with maximal\ncoherence generating power and study the properties of our measure when the\nunitary is drawn at random from the Haar distribution. For large state-space\ndimension a random unitary has, with overwhelming probability, nearly maximal\ncoherence generating power with respect to any basis. Finally, extensions to\ngeneral unital quantum operations and the relation to the concept of asymmetry\nare discussed.\n", "  The enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE), and subsequent\nreduction of cost, of light emitting diodes (LEDs) is of crucial importance in\nthe current lightening market. For this reason, we propose here a PCE-enhanced\nLED architecture, based on a partially reflecting metasurface cavity (PRMC)\nstructure. This structure simultaneously enhances the light extraction\nefficiency (LEE) and the spontaneous emission rate (SER) of the LED by\nenforcing the emitted light to radiate perpendicularly to the device, so as to\nsuppress wave trapping and enhance field confinement near the emitter, while\nensuring cavity resonance matching and maximal constructive field interference.\nThe PRMC structure is designed using a recent surface susceptibility\nmetasurface synthesis technique. A PRMC blue LED design is presented and\ndemonstrated by full-wave simulation to provide LEE and SER enhancements by\nfactors 4.0 and 1.9, respectively, which correspond to PCE enhancement factors\nof 6.2, 5.2 and 4.5 for IQEs of 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75, respectively, suggesting\nthat the PRMC concept has a promising potential in LED technology.\n", "  We present a universal method to include residual un-modeled background shape\nuncertainties in likelihood based statistical tests for high energy physics and\nastroparticle physics. This approach provides a simple and natural protection\nagainst mismodeling, thus lowering the chances of a false discovery or of an\nover constrained confidence interval, and allows a natural transition to\nunbinned space. Unbinned likelihood allows optimal usage of information for the\ndata and the models, and enhances the sensitivity.\n  We show that the asymptotic behavior of the test statistic can be regained in\ncases where the model fails to describe the true background behavior, and\npresent 1D and 2D case studies for model-driven and data-driven background\nmodels. The resulting penalty on sensitivities follows the actual discrepancy\nbetween the data and the models, and is asymptotically reduced to zero with\nincreasing knowledge.\n", "  Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we predict that a\nmonolayer of OsCl$_3$---a layered material whose interlayer coupling is weaker\nthan in graphite---possesses a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulating phase\ngenerated by the combination of honeycomb lattice of osmium atoms, their strong\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) and ferromagnetic ground state with {\\em in-plane}\neasy-axis. The band gap opened by SOC is \\mbox{$E_g \\simeq 67$ meV} (or\n\\mbox{$\\simeq 191$ meV} if the easy-axis can be tilted out of the plane by an\nexternal electric field), and the estimated Curie temperature of such {\\em\nanisotropic planar rotator} ferromagnet is $T_\\mathrm{C} \\lesssim 350$ K. The\nChern number $\\mathcal{C}=-1$, generated by the manifold of Os $t_{2g}$ bands\ncrossing the Fermi energy, signifies the presence of a single chiral edge state\nin nanoribbons of finite width, where we further show that edge states are\nspatially narrower for zigzag than armchair edges and investigate edge-state\ntransport in the presence of vacancies at Os sites. Since $5d$ electrons of Os\nexhibit {\\em both} strong SOC and moderate correlation effects, we employ DFT+U\ncalculations to show how increasing on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$: gradually\nreduces $E_g$ while maintaining $\\mathcal{C} = -1$ for $0 < U < U_c$; leads to\nmetallic phase with $E_g = 0$ at $U_c$; and opens the gap of topologically\ntrivial Mott insulating phase with $\\mathcal{C}=0$ for $U > U_c$.\n", "  Using the KEDR detector at the VEPP-4M $e^+e^-$ collider, we have determined\nthe values of $R$ at thirteen points of the center-of-mass energy between 1.84\nand 3.05 GeV. The achieved accuracy is about or better than $3.9\\%$ at most of\nthe energy points with a systematic uncertainty less than $2.4\\%$.\n", "  This work analyses the dynamical properties of periodically-driven band\nmodels. Focusing on the case of Bose-Einstein condensates, and using a\nmeanfield approach to treat inter-particle collisions, we identify the origin\nof dynamical instabilities arising due to the interplay between the external\ndrive and interactions. We present a widely-applicable generic numerical method\nto extract instability rates, and link parametric instabilities to uncontrolled\nenergy absorption at short times. Based on the existence of parametric\nresonances, we then develop an analytical approach within Bogoliubov theory,\nwhich quantitatively captures the instability rates of the system, and provides\nan intuitive picture of the relevant physical processes, including an\nunderstanding of how transverse modes affect the formation of parametric\ninstabilities. Importantly, our calculations demonstrate an agreement between\nthe instability rates determined from numerical simulations, and those\npredicted by theory. To determine the validity regime of the meanfield\nanalysis, we compare the latter to the weakly-coupled conserving approximation.\nThe tools developed and the results obtained in this work are directly relevant\nto present-day ultracold-atom experiments based on shaken optical lattices, and\nare expected to provide an insightful guidance in the quest for Floquet\nengineering.\n", "  We investigate charge relaxation in quantum-wires of spin-less disordered\nfermions ($t{-}V$-model). Our observable is the time-dependent density\npropagator, $\\Pi_{\\varepsilon}(x,t)$, calculated in windows of different energy\ndensity, $\\varepsilon$, of the many-body Hamiltonian and at different disorder\nstrengths, $W$, not exceeding the critical value $W_\\text{c}$. The width\n$\\Delta x_\\varepsilon(t)$ of $\\Pi_\\varepsilon(x,t)$ exhibits a behavior $d\\ln\n\\Delta x_\\varepsilon(t) / d\\ln t {=} \\beta_\\varepsilon(t)$, where the exponent\nfunction $\\beta_\\varepsilon(t){\\lesssim}1/2$ is seen to depend strongly on $L$\nat all investigated parameter combinations. (i) We confirm the existence of a\nregion in phase space that exhibits subdiffusive dynamics in the sense that\n$\\beta_\\varepsilon{<}1/2$ in large window of times. However, subdiffusion might\npossibly be transient, only, finally giving way to a conventional diffusive\nbehavior with $\\beta_{\\varepsilon}{=}1/2$. (ii) We cannot confirm the existence\nof many-body mobility edges even in regions of the phase-diagram that have been\nreported to be deep in the delocalized phase. (iii) (Transient) subdiffusion\n$0<\\beta_\\varepsilon(t)\\lesssim 1/2$, coexists with an enhanced probability for\nreturning to the origin, $\\Pi_\\varepsilon(0,t)$, decaying much slower than\n$1/\\Delta x_\\varepsilon (t)$. Correspondingly, the spatial decay of\n$\\Pi_\\varepsilon(x,t)$ is far from Gaussian being exponential or even slower.\nOn a phenomenological level, our findings are broadly consistent with effects\nof strong disorder and (fractal) Griffiths regions.\n", "  We study the effects of short-range interactions on a generalized\nthree-dimensional Weyl semimetal, where the band touching points act as the\n(anti)monopoles of Abelian Berry curvature of strength $n$. We show that any\nlocal interaction has a \\emph{negative} scaling dimension $-2/n$. Consequently\nall Weyl semimetals are stable against weak short-range interactions. For\nsufficiently strong interactions, we demonstrate that the Weyl semimetal either\nundergoes a first order transition into a band insulator or a continuous\ntransition into a symmetry breaking phase. A translational symmetry breaking\naxion insulator and a rotational symmetry breaking semimetal are two prominent\ncandidates for the broken symmetry phase. At the one-loop order, the\ncorrelation length exponent for continuous transitions is $\\nu=n/2$, indicating\ntheir non-Gaussian nature for any $n>1$. We also discuss the scaling of the\nthermodynamic and transport quantities in general Weyl semimetals as well as\ninside the broken symmetry phases.\n", "  A quantum multimeter is a programmable device that can implement measurements\nof different observables depending on the programming quantum state inserted\ninto it. The advantage of this arrangement over a single purpose device is in\nits versatility: one can realize various measurements simply by changing the\nprogramming state. The classical manipulation of measurement output data is\nknown as post-processing. In this work we study the post-processing assisted\nquantum programming, which is a protocol where quantum programming and\nclassical post-processing are combined. We provide examples showing that these\ntwo processes combined can be more efficient than either of them used\nseparately. Furthermore, we derive an inequality relating the programming\nresources to their corresponding programmed observables, thereby enabling us to\nstudy the limitations on post-processing assisted quantum programming.\n", "  The conserved magnetic flux of U(1) electrodynamics coupled to matter in four\ndimensions is associated with a generalized global symmetry. We study the\nrealization of such a symmetry at finite temperature and develop the\nhydrodynamic theory describing fluctuations of a conserved 2-form current\naround thermal equilibrium. This can be thought of as a systematic derivation\nof relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, constrained only by symmetries and\neffective field theory. We construct the entropy current and show that at first\norder in derivatives, there are seven dissipative transport coefficients. We\npresent a universal definition of resistivity in a theory of dynamical\nelectromagnetism and derive a direct Kubo formula for the resistivity in terms\nof correlation functions of the electric field operator. We also study\nfluctuations and collective modes, deriving novel expressions for the\ndissipative widths of magnetosonic and Alfven modes. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat a non-trivial truncation of the theory can be performed at low\ntemperatures compared to the magnetic field: this theory has an emergent\nLorentz invariance along magnetic field lines, and hydrodynamic fluctuations\nare now parametrized by a fluid tensor rather than a fluid velocity.\nThroughout, no assumption is made of weak electromagnetic coupling. Thus, our\ntheory may have phenomenological relevance for dense electromagnetic plasmas.\n", "  Entanglement has long stood as one of the characteristic features of quantum\nmechanics, yet recent developments have emphasized the importance of\nquantumness beyond entanglement for quantum foundations and technologies. We\ndemonstrate that entanglement cannot entirely capture the worst-case\nsensitivity in quantum interferometry, when quantum probes are used to estimate\nthe phase imprinted by a Hamiltonian, with fixed energy levels but variable\neigenbasis, acting on one arm of an interferometer. This is shown by defining a\nbipartite entanglement monotone tailored to this interferometric setting and\nproving that it never exceeds the so-called interferometric power, a quantity\nwhich relies on more general quantum correlations beyond entanglement and\ncaptures the relevant resource. We then prove that the interferometric power\ncan never increase when local commutativity-preserving operations are applied\nto qubit probes, an important step to validate such a quantity as a genuine\nquantum correlations monotone. These findings are accompanied by a\nroom-temperature nuclear magnetic resonance experimental investigation, in\nwhich two-qubit states with extremal (maximal and minimal) interferometric\npower at fixed entanglement are produced and characterized.\n", "  We study fixed points of the easy-plane $\\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ field theory by\ncombining quantum Monte Carlo simulations of lattice models of easy-plane\nSU($N$) superfluids with field theoretic renormalization group calculations, by\nusing ideas of deconfined criticality. From our simulations, we present\nevidence that at small $N$ our lattice model has a first order phase transition\nwhich progressively weakens as $N$ increases, eventually becoming continuous\nfor large values of $N$. Renormalization group calculations in $4-\\epsilon$\ndimensions provide an explanation of these results as arising due to the\nexistence of an $N_{ep}$ that separates the fate of the flows with easy-plane\nanisotropy. When $N<N_{ep}$ the renormalization group flows to a discontinuity\nfixed point and hence a first order transition arises. On the other hand, for\n$N > N_{ep}$ the flows are to a new easy-plane $\\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ fixed point\nthat describes the quantum criticality in the lattice model at large $N$. Our\nlattice model at its critical point thus gives efficient numerical access to a\nnew strongly coupled gauge-matter field theory.\n", "  Two dimensional (2D) materials provide a unique platform to explore the full\npotential of magnetic proximity driven phenomena, which can be further used for\napplications in next generation spintronic devices. Of particular interest is\nto understand and control spin currents in graphene by the magnetic exchange\nfield of a nearby ferromagnetic material in graphene/ferromagnetic-insulator\n(FMI) heterostructures. Here, we present the experimental study showing the\nstrong modulation of spin currents in graphene layers by controlling the\ndirection of the exchange field due to FMI magnetization. Owing to clean\ninterfaces, a strong magnetic exchange coupling leads to the experimental\nobservation of complete spin modulation at low externally applied magnetic\nfields in short graphene channels. Additionally, we discover that the graphene\nspin current can be fully dephased by randomly fluctuating exchange fields.\nThis is manifested as an unusually strong temperature dependence of the\nnon-local spin signals in graphene, which is due to spin relaxation by\nthermally-induced transverse fluctuations of the FMI magnetization.\n", "  We study the Anderson single-level quantum dot attached to two BCS\nsuperconducting leads with the same gap size. We reveal that a system with\nasymmetric tunnel coupling to the leads ($\\Gamma_{L}\\neq\\Gamma_{R}$) can be\nrelated to the symmetric system with the same net coupling strength\n$\\Gamma=\\Gamma_{L}+\\Gamma_{R}$. Surprisingly, it is the symmetric case which is\nthe most general, meaning that all physical quantities in case of asymmetric\ncoupling are fully determined by the symmetric ones. We give ready-to-use\nconversion formulas for the $0-\\pi$ phase transition boundary, on-dot\nquantities, and the Josephson current, and illustrate them on the NRG results\nof Oguri, Tanaka and Bauer [Phys. Rev. B 87, 075432 (2013)] for the\nthree-terminal setup. We apply our theory to the recent $0-\\pi$ transition\nmeasurement of Delagrange et al. [Phys. Rev. B 93, 196437 (2016)] and determine\nthe asymmetry of the experimental setup from the measured transition width.\nFinally, we establish that the widely assumed Kondo \"universality\" of physical\nquantities depending only on the ratio of the Kondo temperature and the\nsuperconducting gap $T_{K}/\\Delta$ cannot hold for asymmetric junctions.\n", "  We investigate both theoretical and computational aspects of using wavelet\nbases to decouple physics on different scales in quantum field theory.\n", "  In this paper we propose a time-independent \\textit{equality} and\ntime-dependent \\textit{inequality}, suitable for an experimental test of the\nhypothesis of realism. The derivation of these relations is based on the\nconcept of conditional probability and on Bayes' theorem in the framework of\nKolmogorov's axiomatics of probability theory. The equality obtained is\nintrinsically different from the well known GHZ-equality and its variants,\nbecause violation of the new equality might be tested in experiments with only\ntwo microsystems in a maximally entangled Bell state $\\big\\vert\\,\n\\Psi^-\\,\\big\\rangle$, while a test of the GHZ-equality requires at least three\nquantum systems in a special state $\\big\\vert\\,\n\\Psi^{\\textrm{GHZ}}\\,\\big\\rangle$. The obtained inequality differs from Bell's,\nWigner's, and Leggett-Garg inequalities, because it deals with spin $s=1/2$\nprojections onto only two non-parallel directions at two different moments of\ntime, while a test of the Bell and Wigner inequalities requires at least three\nnon-parallel directions, and a test of the Leggett-Garg inequalities -- at\nleast three distinct moments of time. Hence, the proposed inequality seems to\nallow one to avoid the \"contextuality loophole\". Violation of the proposed\nequality and inequality is illustrated with the behaviour of a pair of\nanti-correlated spins in an external magnetic field and also with the\noscillations of flavour-entangled pairs of neutral pseudoscalar mesons.\n", "  Since entanglement is not an observable per se, measuring its value in\npractice is a difficult task. Here we propose a protocol for quantifying a\nparticular entanglement measure, namely concurrence, of an arbitrary two-qubit\npure state via a single fixed measurement set-up by exploiting so-called weak\nmeasurements and the associated weak values together with the properties of the\nLaguerre-Gaussian modes. The virtue of our technique is that it is generally\napplicable for all two-qubit systems and does not involve simultaneous copies\nof the entangled state. We also propose an explicit optical implementation of\nthe protocol.\n", "  Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is used to study the\nscattering rates of charge carriers from the hole pockets near Gamma in the\niron-based high-Tc hole doped superconductors KxBa1-xFe2As2 x=0.4 and\nKxEu1-xFe2As2 x=0.55$ and the electron doped compound Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 x=0.075.\nThe scattering rate for any given band is found to depend linearly on energy,\nindicating a non-Fermi liquid regime. The scattering rates in the hole-doped\ncompound are considerably larger than those in the electron-doped compounds. In\nthe hole-doped systems the scattering rate of the charge carriers of the inner\nhole pocket is about three times bigger than the binding energy indicating that\nthe spectral weight is heavily incoherent. The strength of the scattering rates\nand the difference between electron and hole doped compounds signals the\nimportance of Hund's exchange coupling for correlation effects in these\niron-based high-Tc superconductors. The experimental results are in qualitative\nagreement with theoretical calculations in the framework of combined density\nfunctional dynamical mean-field theory.\n", "  In this paper we present an overview of the MAGNA (Multiple AGN Activity)\nproject aiming at a comprehensive study of multiple supemassive black hole\nsystems. With the main goal to characterize the sources in merging systems at\ndifferent stages of evolution, we selected a sample of objects optically\nclassified as multiple systems on the basis of emission line diagnostics and\nstarted a massive multiband observational campaign. Here we report on the\ndiscovery of the exceptionally high AGN density compact group SDSS~J0959+1259.\nA multiband study suggests that strong interactions are taking place among its\ngalaxies through tidal forces, therefore this system represents a case study\nfor physical mechanisms that trigger nuclear activity and star formation. We\nalso present a preliminary analysis of the multiple AGN system\nSDSS~J1038+3921.}\n", "  Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are bright extragalactic sources with\nX-ray luminosities above 10^39 erg/s powered by accretion onto compact objects.\nAccording to the first studies performed with XMM-Newton ULXs seemed to be\nexcellent candidates to host intermediate-mass black holes (10^2-4 solar\nmasses). However, in the last years the interpretation of super-Eddington\naccretion onto stellar-mass black holes or neutron stars for most ULXs has\ngained a strong consensus. One critical missing piece to confirm the\nsuper-Eddington scenario was the direct detection of the massive,\nradiatively-driven winds expected as atomic emission/absorption lines in ULX\nspectra. The first evidence for winds was found as residuals in the soft X-ray\nspectra of ULXs. Most recently we have been able to resolve these residuals\ninto rest-frame emission and blueshifted (~0.2c) absorption lines arising from\nhighly ionized gas in the deep high-resolution XMM-Newton spectra of two\nultraluminous X-ray sources. The compact object is therefore surrounded by\npowerful ultrafast winds as predicted by models of hyper-Eddington accretion.\nHere we discuss the relevance of these discoveries and the importance of\nfurther, deep, XMM-Newton observations of powerful winds in many other\nultraluminous X-ray sources to estimate the energetics of the wind, the\ngeometry of the system, and the masses of the central accretors.\n", "  We present two new methods for performing ab initio calculations of excited\nstates for closed-shell systems within the in-medium similarity renormalization\ngroup (IMSRG) framework. Both are based on combining the IMSRG with simple\nmany-body methods commonly used to target excited states, such as the\nTamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and equations-of-motion (EOM) techniques. In\nthe first approach, a two-step sequential IMSRG transformation is used to drive\nthe Hamiltonian to a form where a simple TDA calculation (i.e., diagonalization\nin the space of $1$p$1$h excitations) becomes exact for a subset of\neigenvalues. In the second approach, equations-of-motion (EOM) techniques are\napplied to the ground-state-decoupled IMSRG Hamiltonian to access excited\nstates. We perform proof-of-principle calculations for parabolic quantum dots\nin two-dimensions and the closed shell nuclei $^{16}$O and $^{22}$O. We find\nthat the TDA-IMSRG approach gives better accuracy than the EOM-IMSRG when\ncalculations converge, but is otherwise lacking the versatility and numerical\nstability of the latter. Our calculated spectra are in reasonable agreement\nwith analogous EOM-coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) calculations, which paves the way\nfor more interesting applications of the EOM-IMSRG to calculations of\nconsistently evolved observables such as electromagnetic strength functions and\nnuclear matrix elements, and extensions to nuclei within 1-2 nucleons of a\nclosed shell by generalizing the EOM ladder operator to include particle-number\nnonconserving terms.\n", "  The motion of soft-glassy materials (SGM) in a confined geometry is strongly\nimpacted by surface roughness. However, the effect of the spatial distribution\nof the roughness remains poorly understood from a more quantitative viewpoint.\nHere we present a comprehensive study of concentrated emulsions flowing in\nmicrofluidic channels, one wall of which is patterned with micron-size equally\nspaced grooves oriented perpendicularly to the flow direction. We show that\nroughness-induced fluidization can be quantitatively tailored by systematically\nchanging both the width and separation of the grooves. We find that a simple\nscaling law describes such fluidization as a function of the density of\ngrooves, suggesting common scenarios for droplet trapping and release.\nNumerical simulations confirm these views and are used to elucidate the\nrelation between fluidization and the rate of plastic rearrangements.\n", "  The Planck survey has quantified polarized Galactic foregrounds and\nestablished that they are a main limiting factor in the quest for the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) B-mode signal induced by primordial gravitational\nwaves during cosmic inflation. Accurate separation of the Galactic foregrounds\ntherefore binds this quest to our understanding of the magnetized interstellar\nmedium (ISM). The two most relevant empirical results from analysis of Planck\ndata are line of sight depolarization arising from fluctuations of the Galactic\nmagnetic field orientation and alignment of filamentary dust structures with\nthe magnetic field at high Galactic latitude. Furthermore, Planck and HI\nemission data in combination indicate that most of the filamentary dust\nstructures are in the cold neutral medium. The goal of this paper is to test\nwhether these salient observational results, taken together, can account fully\nfor the statistical properties of the dust polarization over a selected low\ncolumn density region comprising 34 % of the southern Galactic cap ($b \\le\n-30\\deg$). To do this, we construct a dust model that incorporates HI column\ndensity maps as tracers of the dust intensity structures and a phenomenological\ndescription of the Galactic magnetic field. By adjusting the parameters of the\ndust model, we were able to reproduce the Planck dust observations at 353 GHz\nin the selected region. Realistic simulations of the polarized dust emission\nenabled by such a dust model are useful for testing the accuracy of component\nseparation methods, studying non-Gaussianity, and constraining the amount of\ndecorrelation with frequency.\n", "  We discuss the influence on spin-fluctuation pairing theory of orbital\nselective strong correlation effects in Fe-based superconductors, particularly\nFe chalcogenide systems. We propose that a key ingredient for an improved\nitinerant pairing theory is orbital selectivity, i.e., incorporating the\nreduced coherence of quasiparticles occupying specific orbital states. This\nmodifies the usual spin-fluctuation via suppression of pair scattering\nprocesses involving those less coherent states and results in orbital selective\nCooper pairing of electrons in the remaining states. We show that this paradigm\nyields remarkably good agreement with the experimentally observed anisotropic\ngap structures in both bulk and monolayer FeSe, as well as LiFeAs, indicating\nthat orbital selective Cooper pairing plays a key role in the more strongly\ncorrelated iron-based superconductors.\n", "  We report the first maximum-light far-Ultraviolet to near-infrared spectra\n(1000A - 1.62um, rest) of a H-poor superluminous supernova, Gaia16apd. At\nz=0.1018, it is one of the closest and the UV brightest such events, with 17.4\n(AB) magnitude in Swift UV band (1928A) at -11days pre-maximum. Assuming an\nexponential form, we derived the rise time of 33days and the peak bolometric\nluminosity of 3x10^{44}ergs^-1. At maximum light, the estimated photospheric\ntemperature and velocity are 17,000K and 14,000kms^-1 respectively. The\ninferred radiative and kinetic energy are roughly 1x10^{51} and 2x10^{52}erg.\nGaia16apd is extremely UV luminous, emitting 50% of its total luminosity at\n1000 - 2500A. Compared to the UV spectra (normalized at 3100A) of well studied\nSN1992A (Ia), SN2011fe(Ia), SN1999em (IIP) and SN1993J (IIb), it has orders of\nmagnitude more far-UV emission. This excess is interpreted primarily as a\nresult of weaker metal line blanketing due to much lower abundance of\niron-group elements in the outer ejecta. Because these elements originate\neither from the natal metallicity of the star, or have been newly produced, our\nobservation provides direct evidence that little of these freshly synthesized\nmaterial, including 56Ni, was mixed into the outer ejecta, and the progenitor\nmetallicity is likely sub-solar. This disfavors Pair-Instability Supernova\n(PISN) models with Helium core masses >=90Msun, where substantial 56Ni material\nis produced. Higher photospheric temperature of Gaia16apd than that of normal\nSNe may also contribute to the observed far-UV excess. We find some indication\nthat UV luminous SLSNe-I like Gaia16apd could be common. Using the UV spectra,\nwe show that WFIRST could detect SLSNe-I out to redshift of 8.\n", "  Three-dimensional (3D) metals/semimetals under magnetic field have an\ninstability toward a density wave (DW) ordering which breaks a translational\nsymmetry along the field direction. Effective boson models for the DW phases\ntake forms of XY models with/without Potts terms. Longitudinal conductivity\nalong the field direction is calculated in the DW phases with inclusion of\neffects of low-energy charge fluctuation (phason) and disorder. A\nsingle-particle imaginary-time Green function is identified with a partition\nfunction of 3D XY models in the presence of pairs of magnetic monopoles. In\nterms of the celebrated electromagnetic duality, electronic spectral function\nis calculated near the DW phase transition. The result shows that the\nsingle-particle spectral function acquires an additional low-energy feature due\nto the strong phason fluctuation. Relevance to an in-plane conductance due to\nsurface chiral Fermi arc states are also discussed.\n", "  In this letter we show how the topological number of a static Hamiltonian can\nbe measured from a dynamical quench process. We focus on a two-band Chern\ninsulator in two-dimension, for instance, the Haldane model, whose dynamical\nprocess can be described by a mapping from the $[k_x,k_y,t]$ space to the Bloch\nsphere, characterized by the Hopf invariant. Such a mapping has been\nconstructed experimentally by measurements in cold atom systems. We show that,\ntaking any two constant vectors on the Bloch sphere, their inverse images of\nthis mapping are two trajectories in the $[k_x,k_y,t]$ space, and the linking\nnumber of these two trajectories exactly equals to the Chern number of the\nstatic Hamiltonian. Applying this result to a recent experiment from the\nHamburg group, we show that the linking number of the trajectories of the phase\nvortices determines the phase boundary of the static Hamiltonian.\n", "  Cross-correlations between biased tracers and the dark matter field encode\ninformation about the physical variables which characterize these tracers.\nHowever, if the physical variables of interest are correlated with one another,\nthen extracting this information is not as straightforward as one might naively\nhave thought. We show how to exploit these correlations so as to estimate\nscale-independent bias factors of all orders in a model-independent way. We\nalso show that failure to account for this will lead to incorrect conclusions\nabout which variables matter and which do not. Morever, accounting for this\nallows one to use the scale dependence of bias to constrain the physics of halo\nformation; to date the argument has been phrased the other way around. We\nillustrate by showing that the scale dependence of linear and nonlinear bias,\nmeasured on nonlinear scales, can be used to provide consistent estimates of\nhow the critical density for halo formation depends on halo mass. Our methods\nwork even when the bias is nonlocal and stochastic, such as when, in addition\nto the spherically averaged density field and its derivatives, the quadrupolar\nshear field also matters for halo formation. In such models, the nonlocal bias\nfactors are closely related to the more familiar local nonlinear bias factors,\nwhich are much easier to measure. Our analysis emphasizes the fact that biased\ntracers are biased because they do not sample fields (density, velocity, shear,\netc.) at all positions in space in the same way that the dark matter does.\n", "  In this work we study canonical gravity in finite regions for which we\nintroduce a generalisation of the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term including the\nImmirzi parameter. We study the canonical formulation on a spacelike\nhypersuface with a boundary sphere and show how the presence of this term leads\nto an unprecedented type of degrees of freedom coming from the restoration of\nthe gauge and diffeomorphism symmetry at the boundary. In the presence of a\nloop quantum gravity state, these boundary degrees of freedom localize along a\nset of punctures on the boundary sphere. We demonstrate that these degrees of\nfreedom are effectively described by auxiliary strings with a 3-dimensional\ninternal target space attached to each puncture. We show that the string\ncurrents represent the local frame field, that the string angular momenta\nrepresent the area flux and that the string stress tensor represents the two\ndimensional metric on the boundary of the region of interest. Finally, we show\nthat the commutators of these broken diffeomorphisms charges of quantum\ngeometry satisfy at each puncture a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c=3$.\nThis leads to a description of the boundary degrees of freedom in terms of a\nCFT structure with central charge proportional to the number of loop punctures.\nThe boundary $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry is recovered via the action of the $U(1)^3$\nKac-Moody generators (associated with the string current) in a way that is the\nexact analog of an infinite dimensional generalization of the Schwinger\nspin-representation. We finally show that this symmetry is broken by the\npresence of background curvature.\n", "  The interaction between a Rydberg electron and a neutral atom situated inside\nits extended orbit is described via contact interactions for each atom-electron\nscattering channel. In ultracold environments, these interactions lead to\nultra-long-range molecular states with binding energies typically ranging from\n$10$-$10^4$MHz. These energies are comparable to the relativistic and hyperfine\nstructure of the separate atomic components. Studies of molecular formation\naiming to reproduce observations with spectroscopic accuracy must therefore\ninclude the hyperfine splitting of the neutral atom and the spin-orbit\nsplittings of both the Rydberg atom and the electron-atom interaction.\nAdiabatic potential energy curves that fully include these additional effects\nare presented for Rb$_2$ and Cs$_2$. The influence of spin degrees of freedom\non the potential energy curves and molecular multipole moments probed in recent\nexperimental work is elucidated and contrasted with other recent theoretical\neffort in this direction.\n", "  The observed masses, radii and temperatures of 60 medium- to long-period\nbinaries, most of which contain a cool, evolved star and a hotter less-evolved\none, are compared with theoretical models which include (a) core convective\novershooting, (b)mass loss, possibly driven by dynamo action as in RS CVn\nbinaries, and (c) tidal friction, including its effect on orbital period\nthrough magnetic braking. A reasonable fit is found in about 42 cases, but in\n11 other cases the primaries appear to have lost either more mass or less mass\nthan the models predict, and in 4 others the orbit is predicted to be either\nmore or less circular than observed. Of the remaining 3 systems, two ($\\gamma$\nPer and HR 8242) have a markedly `over-evolved' secondary, our explanation\nbeing that the primary component is the merged remnant of a former short-period\nsub-binary in a former triple system. The last system (V695 Cyg) defies any\nagreement at present. Mention is also made of three other systems (V643 Ori, OW\nGem and V453 Cep), which are relevant to our discussion.\n", "  Galaxy clusters are thought to grow hierarchically through the continuous\nmerging and accretion of smaller structures across cosmic time. In the local\nUniverse, these phenomena are still active in the outer regions of massive\nclusters ($R>R_{500}$), where the matter distribution is expected to become\nclumpy and asymmetric because of the presence of accreting structures. We\npresent the XMM-Newton Cluster Outskirts Project (X-COP), which targets the\nouter regions of a sample of 13 massive clusters\n($M_{500}>3\\times10^{14}M_\\odot$) in the redshift range 0.04-0.1 at uniform\ndepth. The sample was selected based on the signal-to-noise ratio in the Planck\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) survey with the aim of combining high-quality X-ray and\nSZ constraints throughout the entire cluster volume. Our observing strategy\nallows us to reach a sensitivity of $3\\times10^{-16}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$\narcmin$^{-2}$ in the [0.5-2.0] keV range thanks to a good control of systematic\nuncertainties. The combination of depth and field of view achieved in X-COP\nwill allow us to pursue the following main goals: i) measure the distribution\nof entropy and thermal energy to an unprecedented level of precision; ii)\nassess the presence of non-thermal pressure support in cluster outskirts; iii)\nstudy the occurrence and mass distribution of infalling gas clumps. We\nillustrate the capabilities of the program with a pilot study on the cluster\nAbell 2142.\n", "  Since the launch of Chandra and XMM-Newton, high-resolution X-ray spectra of\ncosmic sources of all kinds have become available. These spectra have resulted\nin major scientific breakthroughs. However, due to the techniques used, in\ngeneral high-quality spectra can only be obtained for the brightest few sources\nof each class. Moreover, except for the most compact extended sources, like\ncool core clusters, grating spectra are limited to point sources. Hitomi made\nanother major step forward, in yielding for the first time a high-quality\nspectrum of an extended source, and improved spectral sensitivity in the Fe-K\nband. For point sources with the proposed Arcus mission, and for all sources\nwith the launch of Athena, X-ray spectroscopy will become mature. It allows us\nto extend the investigations from the few handful of brightest sources of each\ncategory to a large number of sources far away in space and time, or to get\nhigh time-resolution, high-spectral resolution spectra of bright time variable\nsources.\n", "  We briefly review the synergy between X-ray and infrared observations for\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) detected in cosmic X-ray surveys, primarily with\nXMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR. We focus on two complementary aspects of this\nX-ray-infrared synergy (1) the identification of the most heavily obscured AGNs\nand (2) the connection between star formation and AGN activity. We also briefly\ndiscuss future prospects for X-ray-infrared studies over the next decade.\n", "  The supermassive black holes originally in the nuclei of two merging galaxies\nwill form a binary in the remnant core. The early evolution of the massive\nbinary is driven by dynamical friction before the binary becomes \"hard\" and\neventually reaches coalescence through gravitational wave emission. { We\nconsider the dynamical friction evolution of massive binaries consisting of a\nsecondary hole orbiting inside a stellar cusp dominated by a more massive\ncentral black hole.} In our treatment we include the frictional force from\nstars moving faster than the inspiralling object which is neglected in the\nstandard Chandrasekhar's treatment. We show that the binary eccentricity\nincreases if the stellar cusp density profile rises less steeply than\n$\\rho\\propto r^{-2}$. In cusps shallower than $\\rho\\propto r^{-1}$ the\nfrictional timescale can become very long due to the deficit of stars moving\nslower than the massive body. Although including the fast stars increases the\ndecay rate, low mass-ratio binaries ($q\\lesssim 10^{-3}$) in sufficiently\nmassive galaxies have decay timescales longer than one Hubble time. During such\nminor mergers the secondary hole stalls on an eccentric orbit at a distance of\norder one tenth the influence radius of the primary hole (i.e., $\\approx\n10-100\\rm pc$ for massive ellipticals). We calculate the expected number of\nstalled satellites as a function of the host galaxy mass, and show that the\nbrightest cluster galaxies should have $\\gtrsim 1$ of such satellites orbiting\nwithin their cores. Our results could provide an explanation to a number of\nobservations, which include multiple nuclei in core ellipticals, off-center\nAGNs and eccentric nuclear disks.\n", "  XMM-Newton is capable of making a transformational advance in our\nunderstanding of how luminous accreting black holes work, by dedicating about\n10 per cent of future observing time to long observations, of order\nMegaseconds, to X-ray variable Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) research. This\nwould enable reverberation studies, already a commonplace feature of AGN, to\nproceed to the next level and follow the behaviour of the powerful dynamic\ncorona. Such a dedicated legacy programme can only be carried out with\nXMM-Newton.\n", "  We present KETJU, a new extension of the widely-used smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics simulation code GADGET-3. The key feature of the code is the\ninclusion of algorithmically regularized regions around every supermassive\nblack hole (SMBH). This allows for simultaneously following global\ngalactic-scale dynamical and astrophysical processes, while solving the\ndynamics of SMBHs, SMBH binaries and surrounding stellar systems at sub-parsec\nscales. The KETJU code includes Post-Newtonian terms in the equations of\nmotions of the SMBHs which enables a new SMBH merger criterion based on the\ngravitational wave coalescence timescale pushing the merger separation of SMBHs\ndown to $\\sim 0.005$ pc. We test the performance of our code by comparison to\nNBODY7 and rVINE. We set up dynamically stable multi-component merger\nprogenitor galaxies to study the SMBH binary evolution during galaxy mergers.\nIn our simulation sample the SMBH binaries do not suffer from the final-parsec\nproblem, which we attribute to the non-spherical shape of the merger remnants.\nFor bulge-only models, the hardening rate decreases with increasing resolution,\nwhereas for models which in addition include massive dark matter halos the SMBH\nbinary hardening rate becomes practically independent of the mass resolution of\nthe stellar bulge. The SMBHs coalesce on average 200 Myr after the formation of\nthe SMBH binary. However, small differences in the initial SMBH binary\neccentricities can result in large differences in the SMBH coalescence times.\nFinally, we discuss the future prospects of KETJU, which allows for a\nstraightforward inclusion of gas physics in the simulations.\n", "  Compton Thick (CT) AGN are a key ingredient of Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB)\nsynthesis models, but are still an elusive component of the AGN population\nbeyond the local Universe. Multi-wavelength surveys are the only way to find\nthem at z > 0.1, and a deep X-ray coverage is crucial in order to clearly\nidentify them among star forming galaxies. As an example, the deep and wide\nCOSMOS survey allowed us to select a total of 34 CT sources. This number is\ncomputed from the 64 nominal CT candidates, each counted for its N H\nprobability distribution function. For each of these sources, rich\nmulti-wavelength information is available, and is used to confirm their\nobscured nature, by comparing the expected AGN luminosity from spectral energy\ndistribution fitting, with the absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity. While\nChandra is more efficient, for a given exposure, in detecting CT candidates in\ncurrent surveys (by a factor ~2), deep XMM-Newton pointings of bright sources\nare vital to fully characterize their properties: NH distribution above 10^25\ncm^-2, reflection intensity etc., all crucial parameters of CXB models. Since\nluminous CT AGN at high redshift are extremely rare, the future of CT studies\nat high redshift will have to rely on the large area surveys currently\nunderway, such as XMM-XXL and Stripe82, and will then require dedicated\nfollow-up with XMM-Newton, while waiting for the advent of the ESA mission\nAthena.\n", "  Using the effective mass theory and the multi-valley envelope function\nrepresentation, we have developed a theoretical framework for computing the\nsingle-electron electronic structure of several phosphorus donors interacting\nin an arbitrary geometrical configuration in silicon taking into account the\nvalley-orbit coupling. The methodology is applied to three coupled phosphorus\ndonors, arranged in a linear chain and in a triangle, and to six donors\narranged in a regular hexagon. The results of the simulations evidence that the\nvalley composition of the single-electron states strongly depends on the\ngeometry of the dopant molecule and its orientation relative to the\ncrystallographic axes of silicon. The electron binding energy of the triatomic\nlinear molecules is larger than that of the diatomic molecule oriented along\nthe same crystallographic axis, but the energy gap between the ground state and\nthe first excited state is not significantly different for internuclear\ndistances from 1.5 to 6.6 nm. Three donor atoms arranged in a triangle geometry\nhave larger binding energies than a triatomic linear chain of dopants with the\nsame internuclear distances. The planar donor molecules are characterized by a\nstrong polarization in favor of the valleys oriented perpendicular to the plane\nof the molecule. The polarization increases with number of atoms forming the\nplanar molecule.\n", "  Gears are rotating machines, meshing with each other by teeth to transmit\ntorque. Interestingly, the rotating directions of two meshing gears are\nopposite, clockwise and counterclockwise. Although this opposite handedness\nmotion has been widely investigated in machinery science, the analogue behavior\nof photons remains undiscovered. Here, we present a simple nanophotonic\ndirectional coupler structure which can generate two meshing gears of angular\nmomentum (AM) of light, optical gears. Due to the abrupt phase shift effect and\nbirefringence effect, the AM states of photons vary with the propagation\ndistance in two adjacent waveguides of the coupler. Thus, by the choice of\ncoupling length, it is able to obtain two light beams with opposite handedness\nof AM, confirming the appearance of optical gears. The full control in the\nhandedness of output beams is achieved via tuning the relative phase between\ntwo orthogonal modes at the input ports. Optical gears thus offer the\npossibility of exploring light-matter interactions in nanoscale, opening up new\navenues in fields of integrated quantum computing and nanoscale bio-sensing of\nchiral molecules.\n", "  The production of prompt photons is one of the most relevant scattering\nprocesses studied at hadron-hadron colliders in recent years. This article will\ngive an overview of the different approaches used to simulate prompt photon\nproduction in the Sherpa event generator framework. Special emphasis is placed\non a complete simulation of this process including fragmentation\nconfigurations. As a novel application a merged simulation of $\\gamma\\gamma$\nand $\\gamma\\gamma+$jet production at NLO accuracy is presented and compared to\nmeasurements from the ATLAS experiment.\n", "  We investigate the viability of sub-millimeter wavelength oscillating\ndeviations from the Newtonian potential at both the theoretical and the\nexperimental/observational level. At the theoretical level such deviations are\ngeneric predictions in a wide range of extensions of General Relativity (GR)\nincluding $f(R)$ theories, massive Brans-Dicke theories, compactified extra\ndimension models and nonlocal extensions of GR. However, the range of\nparameters associated with such oscillating deviations is usually connected\nwith instabilities. An exception emerges in nonlocal gravity theories where\noscillating deviations from Newtonian potential occur naturally on\nsub-millimeter scales without instabilities. As an example of a model with\nunstable Newtonian oscillations we review an $f(R)$ expansion around General\nRelativity of the form $f(R)=R+\\frac{1}{6 m^2} R^2$ with $m^2<0$ pointing out\npossible stabilization mechanisms. As an example of a model with stable\nNewtonian oscillations we discuss nonlocal gravity theories. If such\noscillations are realized in Nature on sub-millimeter scales, a signature is\nexpected in torsion balance experiments testing Newton's law. We search for\nsuch a signature in the torsion balance data of the Washington experiment\n(combined torque residuals) testing Newton's law at sub-millimeter scales. We\nshow that an oscillating residual ansatz with spatial wavelength $\\lambda\n\\simeq 0.1mm$ provides a better fit to the data compared to the residual\nNewtonian constant ansatz by $\\Delta \\chi^2 = -15$. Similar improved fits, also\noccur in about $10\\%$ of Monte Carlo realizations of Newtonian data. Thus, the\nsignificance level of this improved fit is at a level of not more than\n$2\\sigma$. The energy scale corresponding to this best fit wavelength is\nidentical to the dark energy length scale $\\lambda_{de} \\equiv\\sqrt[4]{\\hbar\nc/\\rho_{ de}}\\approx 0.1mm$.\n", "  A major obstacle to attain the fundamental precision limit of the phase\nestimation in an interferometry is the identification and implementation of the\noptimal measurement. Here we demonstrate that this can be accomplished by the\nuse of three conventional measurements among interferometers with Bayesian\nestimation techniques. Conditions that hold for the precision limit to be\nattained with these measurements are obtained by explicitly calculating the\nFisher information. Remarkably, these conditions are naturally satisfied in\nmost interferometric experiments. We apply our results to an experiment of\natomic spectroscopy and examine robustness of phase sensitivity for the\ntwo-axis counter-twisted state suffering from detection noise.\n", "  We discuss the effective infrared theory governing a light scalar's long\nwavelength dynamics in de Sitter spacetime. We show how the separation of\nscales around the physical curvature radius $k/a \\sim H$ can be performed\nconsistently with a window function and how short wavelengths can be integrated\nout in the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism. At leading order, and for\ntime scales $\\Delta t \\gg H^{-1}$, this results in the well-known Starobinsky\nstochastic evolution. However, our approach allows for the computation of\nquantum UV corrections, generating an effective potential on which the\nstochastic dynamics takes place. The long wavelength stochastic dynamical\nequations are now second order in time, incorporating temporal scales $\\Delta t\n\\sim H^{-1}$ and resulting in a Kramers equation for the probability\ndistribution - more precisely the Wigner function - in contrast to the more\nusual Fokker-Planck equation. This feature allows us to non-perturbatively\nevaluate, within the stochastic formalism, not only expectation values of field\ncorrelators, but also the stress-energy tensor of $\\phi$.\n", "  Peculiar groups of X-ray emitting isolated neutron stars, which include\nmagnetars, the \"Magnificent Seven\", and central compact objects in supernova\nremnants, escape detection in standard pulsar surveys. Yet, they constitute a\nkey element in understanding the neutron star evolution and phenomenology.\nTheir use in population studies in the galactic scale has been hindered by the\nscarcity of their detection. The all-sky survey of eROSITA on-board the\nforthcoming Spectrum-RG mission has the unique potential to unveil the X-ray\nfaint part of the population and constrain evolutionary models. To create a\nforecast for the four-year all-sky survey, we perform Monte Carlo simulations\nof a population synthesis model, where we follow the evolutionary tracks of\nthermally emitting neutron stars in the Milky Way and test their detectability.\nIn this work, we discuss strategies for pinpointing the most promising\ncandidates for follow-up observing campaigns using current and future\nfacilities.\n", "  This article provides a review of X-ray variability from late-type stars with\nparticular focus on the achievements of XMM-Newton and its potential for future\nstudies in this field.\n", "  Accounting for nebular emission when modeling galaxy spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) is important, as both line and continuum emission can\ncontribute significantly to the total observed flux. In this work, we present a\nnew nebular emission model integrated within the Flexible Stellar Population\nSynthesis code that computes the total line and continuum emission for complex\nstellar populations using the photoionization code Cloudy. The self-consistent\ncoupling of the nebular emission to the matched ionizing spectrum produces\nemission line intensities that correctly scale with the stellar population as a\nfunction of age and metallicity. This more complete model of galaxy SEDs will\nimprove estimates of global gas properties derived with diagnostic diagrams,\nstar formation rates based on H$\\alpha$, and stellar masses derived from NIR\nbroadband photometry. Our models agree well with results from other\nphotoionization models and are able to reproduce observed emission from H II\nregions and star-forming galaxies. Our models show improved agreement with the\nobserved H II regions in the Ne III/O II plane and show satisfactory agreement\nwith He II emission from $z=2$ galaxies when including rotating stellar models.\nModels including post-asymptotic giant branch stars are able to reproduce line\nratios consistent with low-ionization emission regions (LIERs).\n", "  We present a proper motion measurement for the halo globular cluster Pyxis,\nusing HST/ACS data as the first epoch, and GeMS/GSAOI Adaptive Optics data as\nthe second, separated by a baseline of about 5 years. This is both the first\nmeasurement of the proper motion of Pyxis and the first calibration and use of\nMulti-Conjugate Adaptive Optics data to measure an absolute proper motion for a\nfaint, distant halo object. Consequently, we present our analysis of the\nAdaptive Optics data in detail. We obtain a proper motion of mu_alpha\ncos(delta)=1.09+/-0.31 mas/yr and mu_delta=0.68+/-0.29 mas/yr. From the proper\nmotion and the line-of-sight velocity we find the orbit of Pyxis is rather\neccentric with its apocenter at more than 100 kpc and its pericenter at about\n30 kpc. We also investigate two literature-proposed associations for Pyxis with\nthe recently discovered ATLAS stream and the Magellanic system. Combining our\nmeasurements with dynamical modeling and cosmological numerical simulations we\nfind it unlikely Pyxis is associated with either system. We examine other Milky\nWay satellites for possible association using the orbit, eccentricity,\nmetallicity, and age as constraints and find no likely matches in satellites\ndown to the mass of Leo II. We propose that Pyxis probably originated in an\nunknown galaxy, which today is fully disrupted. Assuming that Pyxis is bound\nand not on a first approach, we derive a 68% lower limit on the mass of the\nMilky Way of 0.95*10^12 M_sun.\n", "  We study theoretically the dynamics of a Shiba state forming around\nprecessing classical spin in an s-wave superconductor. Utilizing a rotating\nwave description for the precessing magnetic impurity, we find the resulting\nShiba bound state quasi-energy and the spatial extension of the Shiba\nwavefunction. We show that such a precession pertains to dc charge and spin\ncurrents flowing through a normal STM tip tunnel coupled to the superconductor\nin the vicinity of the impurity. We calculate these currents and find that they\nstrongly depend on the magnetic impurity precession frequency, precession\nangle, and on the position of the Shiba energy level in the superconducting\ngap. The resulting charge current is found to be proportional to the difference\nbetween the electron and hole wavefunctions of the Shiba state, being a direct\nmeasure for such an asymmetry. By dynamically driving the impurity one can\ninfer the spin dependence of the Shiba states in the absence of a\nspin-polarized STM tip\n", "  Finding the global minimum in a rugged potential landscape is a\ncomputationally hard task, often equivalent to relevant optimization problems.\nSimulated annealing is a computational technique which explores the\nconfiguration space by mimicking thermal noise. By slow cooling, it freezes the\nsystem in a low-energy configuration, but the algorithm often gets stuck in\nlocal minima. In quantum annealing, the thermal noise is replaced by\ncontrollable quantum fluctuations, and the technique can be implemented in\nmodern quantum simulators. However, quantum-adiabatic schemes become\nprohibitively slow in the presence of quasidegeneracies. Here we propose a\nstrategy which combines ideas from simulated annealing and quantum annealing.\nIn such hybrid algorithm, the outcome of a quantum simulator is processed on a\nclassical device. While the quantum simulator explores the configuration space\nby repeatedly applying quantum fluctuations and performing projective\nmeasurements, the classical computer evaluates each configuration and enforces\na lowering of the energy. We have simulated this algorithm for small instances\nof the random energy model, showing that it potentially outperforms both\nsimulated thermal annealing and adiabatic quantum annealing. It becomes most\nefficient for problems involving many quasi-degenerate ground states.\n", "  Peculiar velocities of objects in the nearby universe are correlated due to\nthe gravitational pull of large-scale structure. By measuring these velocities,\nwe have a unique opportunity to test the cosmological model at the lowest\nredshifts. We perform this test, using current data to constrain the amplitude\nof the \"signal\" covariance matrix describing the velocities and their\ncorrelations. We consider a new, well-calibrated \"Supercal\" set of low-redshift\nSNe Ia as well as a set of distances derived from the fundamental plane\nrelation of 6dFGS galaxies. Analyzing the SN and galaxy data separately, both\nresults are consistent with the peculiar velocity signal of our fiducial\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, ruling out the noise-only model with zero peculiar\nvelocities at greater than $7\\sigma$ (SNe) and $8\\sigma$ (galaxies). When the\ntwo data sets are combined appropriately, the precision of the test increases\nslightly, resulting in a constraint on the signal amplitude of $A =\n1.05_{-0.21}^{+0.25}$, where $A = 1$ corresponds to our fiducial model.\nEquivalently, we report an 11% measurement of the product of the growth rate\nand amplitude of mass fluctuations evaluated at $z_\\text{eff} = 0.02$, $f\n\\sigma_8 = 0.428_{-0.045}^{+0.048}$, valid for our fiducial $\\Lambda$CDM model.\nWe explore the robustness of the results to a number of conceivable variations\nin the analysis and find that individual variations shift the preferred signal\namplitude by less than ${\\sim}0.5\\sigma$. We briefly discuss our Supercal SN Ia\nresults in comparison with our previous results using the JLA compilation.\n", "  An exact analytical analysis of anomalous diffusion on a fractal mesh is\npresented. The fractal mesh structure is a direct product of two fractal sets\nwhich belong to a main branch of backbones and side branch of fingers. The\nfractal sets of both backbones and fingers are constructed on the entire\n(infinite) $y$ and $x$ axises. To this end we suggested a special algorithm of\nthis special construction. The transport properties of the fractal mesh is\nstudied, in particular, subdiffusion along the backbones is obtained with the\ndispersion relation $\\langle x^2(t)\\rangle\\sim t^{\\beta}$, where the transport\nexponent $\\beta<1$ is determined by the fractal dimensions of both backbone and\nfingers. Superdiffusion with $\\beta>1$ has been observed as well when the\nenvironment is controlled by means of a memory kernel.\n", "  Colloidal gels are a prototypical example of a heterogeneous network solid\nwhose complex properties are governed by thermally-activated dynamics. In this\nLetter we experimentally establish the connection between the intermittent\ndynamics of individual particles and their local connectivity. We interpret our\nexperiments with a model that describes single-particle dynamics based on\nhighly cooperative thermal debonding. The model, in quantitative agreement with\nexperiments, provides a microscopic picture for the structural origin of\ndynamical heterogeneity in colloidal gels and sheds new light on the link\nbetween structure and the complex mechanics of these heterogeneous solids.\n", "  The extremely stringent requirement on material quality has hindered the\ninvestigation and potential applications of exotic chiral magnetic effect in\nDirac semimetals. Here, we propose that gray tin is a perfect candidate for\nobserving the chiral anomaly effect and Shubnikov-de-Haas (SdH) oscillation at\nrelatively low magnetic field. Based on effective $k.p$ analysis and\nfirst-principles calculations, we discover that gray tin becomes a Dirac\nsemimetal under tensile uniaxial strain, in contrast to a topological insulator\nunder compressive uniaxial strain as known before. In this newly found Dirac\nsemimetal state, two Dirac points which are tunable by tensile [001] strains,\nlie in the $k_z$ axis and Fermi arcs appear in the (100) surface. Duo the low\ncarrier concentration and high mobility of gray tin, a large chiral anomaly\ninduced negative magnetoresistance and a strong SdH oscillation are anticipated\nin this half of strain spectrum. Comparing to other Dirac semimetals, the\nproposed Dirac semimetal state in the nontoxic elemental gray tin can be more\neasily manipulated and accurately controlled. We envision that gray tin\nprovides a perfect platform for strain engineering of chiral magnetic effects\nby sweeping through the strain spectrum from positive to negative and vice\nversa.\n", "  We study the spectrum of two kinds of operators involving a conical geometry:\nthe Dirichlet Laplacian in conical layers and Schr\\\"odinger operators with\nattractive $\\delta$-interactions supported by infinite cones. Under the\nassumption that the cones have smooth cross-sections, we prove that such\noperators have infinitely many eigenvalues accumulating below the threshold of\nthe essential spectrum and we express the accumulation rate in terms of the\neigenvalues of an auxiliary one-dimensional operator with a curvature-induced\npotential.\n", "  We define and study one-dimensional model of irreversible aggregation of\nparticles obeying a discrete-time kinetics which is a special limit of the\ngeneralized Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (gTASEP) on open\nchains. The model allows for clusters of particles to translate as a whole\nentity one site to the right with the same probability as single particles do.\nA particle and a cluster, as well as two clusters, irreversibly aggregate\nwhenever they become nearest neighbors. Nonequilibrium stationary phases appear\nunder the balance of injection and ejection of particles. By extensive Monte\nCarlo simulations it is established that the phase diagram in the plane of the\ninjection-ejection probabilities consists of three stationary phases: a\nmulti-particle (MP) one, a completely filled (CF) phase and a 'mixed' (MP+CF)\none. The transitions between these phases are: an unusual transition between MP\nand CF with jump discontinuity in both the bulk density and the current, a\nconventional first-order transition with a jump in the bulk density between MP\nand MP+CF, and a continuous clustering-type transition from MP to CF, which\ntakes place throughout the MP+CF phase between them. By the data collapse\nmethod a finite-size scaling function for the current and bulk density is\nobtained near the unusual phase transition line. A diverging correlation length\nassociated with that transition is identified and interpreted as the size of\nthe largest cluster. The model allows for a future extension to account for\npossible cluster fragmentation.\n", "  For the past 17 years, both XMM-Newton and Chandra have brought the powerful\ncombination of high spatial and spectral resolution to the study of black hole\nsystems. Each of these attributes requires special consideration--- in\ncomparison to lower spatial resolution, CCD quality spectra--- when modeling\nobservations obtained by these spacecraft. A good understanding of the high\nresolution spectra is in fact required to model properly lower resolution CCD\nspectra, with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) instrument on\nXMM-Newton maintaining the highest \"figure of merit\" at soft X-ray energies for\nall missions flying or currently planned for the next decade. Thanks to its\neven higher spectral resolution, the use of Chandra-High Energy Transmission\nGratings (HETG), albeit with longer integration times, allows for one to bring\nfurther clarity to RGS studies. A further promising route for continued studies\nis the combination of high spectral resolution at soft X-rays, via RGS and/or\nHETG, with contemporaneous broadband coverage extending to hard X-rays (e.g.,\nNuSTAR or INTEGRAL spectra). Such studies offer special promise for answering\nfundamental questions about accretion in black hole systems; however, they have\nreceived only moderate consideration to date. This may be due in part to the\ndifficulty of analyzing high resolution spectra. In response, we must continue\nto develop software tools that make the analysis of high resolution X-ray\nspectra more accessible to the wider astrophysics community.\n", "  Using the observations from Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we develop a computational algorithm to\nautomatically identify the bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) in the active\nregions, and then study their statistical properties. The individual magnetic\n(positive or negative) pole of the BMR is determined from the region with an\nabsolute strength above 55 G and with an area above 250 pixel^2 (495 Mm^2),\nwhile a BMR is identified as a pair of positive and negative poles with a\nshortest area-weight distance between them. Based on this method, 2234 BMRs are\nidentified from the MDI synoptic magnetograms between the Carrington Rotation\n1909 (1996 May 06) and 2104 (2010 December 10). 1005 of them are located in the\nnorthern hemisphere, while the other 1229 are in the southern hemisphere.We\nfind that the BMR paraments (e.g., latitudes, separations, fragments, and\nstrength) are similar to those of active regions (ARs). Moreover, based on the\nmaximum likelihood estimation (MLE)method, the frequency distributions of these\nBMRs occurrence as functions of area size and magnetic flux exhibit a power-law\nbehavior. We also find that their orientation angles follow the Hale's Polarity\nLaws and deviate slightly to the solar equator direction. Consistent with the\nprevious findings, we obtain the orientation angles dependence on the latitudes\nfor the normal BMRs during the 23rd solar cycle. The north-south asymmetry of\nthese BMRs is also detected here.\n", "  We introduce a technique for gravitational-wave analysis, where Gaussian\nprocess regression is used to emulate the strain spectrum of a stochastic\nbackground using population-synthesis simulations. This leads to direct\nBayesian inference on astrophysical parameters. For PTAs specifically, we\ninterpolate over the parameter space of supermassive black-hole binary\nenvironments, including 3-body stellar scattering, and evolving orbital\neccentricity. We illustrate our approach on mock data, and assess the prospects\nfor inference with data similar to the NANOGrav 9-yr data release.\n", "  The non-linear relation between X-ray and UV luminosity in quasars can be\nused to estimate their distance. Recently, we have shown that despite the large\ndispersion of the relation, a Hubble Diagram made of large samples of quasars\ncan provide unique constraints on cosmology at high redshift. Furthermore, the\ndispersion of the relation is heavily affected by measurement errors: until now\nwe have used serendipitous X-ray observations, but dedicated observations would\nsignificantly increase the precision of the distance estimates. We discuss the\nfuture role of XMM in this new field, showing (1) the fundamental contribution\nof the Serendipitous Source Catalogue and of large surveys, and (2) the\nbreakthrough advancements we may achieve with the observation of a large number\nof SDSS quasars at high redshift: every ~10 quasars observed at z$\\sim$3 would\nbe equivalent to discovering a supernova at that redshift.\n", "  We explore the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of Bose gases in a universal\nregime associated to nonthermal fixed points. While previous investigations\nconcentrated on scaling functions and exponents describing equal-time\ncorrelations, we compute the additional scaling functions and dynamic exponent\n$z$ characterizing the frequency dependence or dispersion from unequal-time\ncorrelations. This allows us to compare the characteristic condensation and\ncorrelation times from a finite-size scaling analysis depending on the system's\nvolume.\n", "  We present a study of the quantum properties of two light fields used to\nparametric four-wave mixing in a Raman-type atomic system. The system realizes\nan effective Hamiltonian of beamsplitter type coupling between the light\nfields, which allows to control squeezing and amplitude distribution of the\nlight fields, as well as realizing their entanglement. The scheme can be\nfeasibly applied to engineer the quantum properties of two single-mode light\nfields in properly chosen input states.\n", "  Wireless data transmission systems such as WiFi or Bluetooth emit coherent\nlight - electromagnetic waves with precisely known amplitude and phase.\nPropagating in space, this radiation forms a hologram - a two-dimensional\nwavefront encoding a three-dimensional view of all objects traversed by the\nlight beam. Here we demonstrate a scheme to record this hologram in a\nphase-coherent fashion across a meter-sized imaging region. We recover\nthree-dimensional views of objects and emitters by feeding the resulting data\ninto digital reconstruction algorithms. Employing a digital implementation of\ndark field propagation to suppress multipath reflection we significantly\nenhance the quality of the resulting images.\n", "  We use a variational principle to derive a mathematical model for a nematic\nelectrolyte in which the liquid crystalline component is described in terms of\na second-rank order tensor. The model extends the previously developed\ndirector-based theory and accounts for presence of disclinations and possible\nbiaxiality. We verify the model by considering a simple but illustrative\nexample of liquid crystal-enabled electro-osmotic flow (LCEO) around a\nstationary dielectric spherical particle placed at the center of a large\ncylindrical container filled with a nematic electrolyte. Assuming homeotropic\nanchoring of the nematic on the surface of the particle and uniform\ndistribution of the director on the surface of the container, we consider two\nconfigurations with a disclination equatorial ring and with a hyperbolic\nhedgehog, respectively. The computed electro-osmotic flows show a strong\ndependence on the director configurations and on the anisotropies of dielectric\npermittivity and electric conductivity of the nematic characteristic of liquid\ncrystal-enabled electrokinetics. Further, the simulations demonstrate space\ncharge separation around the dielectric sphere, even in the case of isotropic\npermittivity and conductivity. This is in agreement with the induced-charge\nelectro-osmotic effect described for isotropic electrolytes surrounding\ndielectric spheres.\n", "  In theories with a broken discrete symmetry, Hubble sized spherical domain\nwalls may spontaneously nucleate during inflation. These objects are\nsubsequently stretched by the inflationary expansion, resulting in a broad\ndistribution of sizes. The fate of the walls after inflation depends on their\nradius. Walls smaller than a critical radius fall within the cosmological\nhorizon early on and collapse due to their own tension, forming ordinary black\nholes. But if a wall is large enough, its repulsive gravitational field becomes\ndominant much before the wall can fall within the cosmological horizon. In this\n\"supercritical\" case, a wormhole throat develops, connecting the ambient\nexterior FRW universe with an interior baby universe, where the exponential\ngrowth of the wall radius takes place. The wormhole pinches off in a time-scale\ncomparable to its light-crossing time, and black holes are formed at its two\nmouths. As discussed in previous work, the resulting black hole population has\na wide distribution of masses and can have significant astrophysical effects.\nThe mechanism of black hole formation has been previously studied for a\ndust-dominated universe. Here we investigate the case of a radiation-dominated\nuniverse, which is more relevant cosmologically, by using numerical simulations\nin order to find the initial mass of a black hole as a function of the wall\nsize at the end of inflation. For large supercritical domain walls, this mass\nnearly saturates the upper bound according to which the black hole cannot be\nlarger than the cosmological horizon. We also find that the subsequent\naccretion of radiation satisfies a scaling relation, resulting in a mass\nincrease by about a factor of 2.\n", "  We report on the unusual behavior of the in-plane thermal conductivity\n($\\kappa$) and torque ($\\tau$) response in the Kitaev-Heisenberg material\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. $\\kappa$ shows a striking enhancement with linear growth\nbeyond H = 7 T, where magnetic order disappears, while $\\tau$ for both of the\nin-plane symmetry directions shows an anomaly at the same field. The\ntemperature- and field-dependence of $\\kappa$ are far more complex than\nconventional phonon and magnon contributions, and require us to invoke the\npresence of unconventional spin excitations whose properties are characteristic\nof a field-induced spin-liquid phase related to the enigmatic physics of the\nKitaev model in an applied magnetic field\n", "  We have examined the spin ordering of an axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising\n(ANNNI) model in two dimensions (2D) near above the antiphase ($\\langle 2\n\\rangle$ phase). We considered an $N_R$-replica system and calculated an\noverlap function $q_m$ between different replicas having used a cluster heat\nbath (CHB) Monte Carlo method. We determined transition temperature between\n$\\langle 2 \\rangle$ phase and a floating incommensurate (IC) phase as $T_{C2}/J\n= 0.89 \\pm 0.01$ with frustration ratio $\\kappa (\\equiv -J_2/J_1) = 0.6$. We\nfound that the spin state at $T \\gtrsim T_{C2}$ may be called as a domain\nstate, because the spin structure is characterized by a sequentially arranged\nfour types of domains with different $\\langle 2 \\rangle$ structures. In the\ndomain state, the 2D XY symmetry of the spin correlation in the IC phase weakly\nbreaks and the diversity of the spin arrangement increases as $T \\rightarrow\nT_{C2}$. The Binder ratio $g_L$ exhibits a depression at $T \\sim T_{C2}$ and\nthe quasi-periodic spin structure, which is realized in the IC phase, becomes\ndiverse at $T \\gtrsim T_{C2}$. We discussed that the domain state is stable\nagainst the thermal fluctuation which brings a two-stage development of the\nspin structure at low temperatures.\n", "  The chiral kinetic theory of Weyl fermions with collisions in the presence of\nweak electric and magnetic fields is derived from quantum field theories. It is\nfound that the side-jump terms in the perturbative solution of Wigner functions\nplay a significant role for the derivation. Moreover, such terms manifest the\nbreaking of Lorentz symmetry for distribution functions. The Lorentz covariance\nof Wigner functions thus leads to modified Lorentz transformation associated\nwith side-jump phenomena further influenced by background fields and\ncollisions.\n", "  Deep imaging of the diffuse light emitted by the stellar fine structures and\nouter halos around galaxies is now often used to probe their past mass\nassembly. Because the extended halos survive longer than the relatively fragile\ntidal features, they trace more ancient mergers. We use images reaching surface\nbrightness limits as low as 28.5-29 mag.arcsec-2 (g-band) to obtain light and\ncolor profiles up to 5-10 effective radii of a sample of nearby early-type\ngalaxies. They were acquired with MegaCam as part of the CFHT MATLAS large\nprogramme. These profiles may be compared to those produced by simulations of\ngalaxy formation and evolution, once corrected for instrumental effects. Indeed\nthey can be heavily contaminated by the scattered light caused by internal\nreflections within the instrument. In particular, the nucleus of galaxies\ngenerates artificial flux in the outer halo, which has to be precisely\nsubtracted. We present a deconvolution technique to remove the artificial halos\nthat makes use of very large kernels. The technique based on PyOperators is\nmore time efficient than the model-convolution methods also used for that\npurpose. This is especially the case for galaxies with complex structures that\nare hard to model. Having a good knowledge of the Point Spread Function (PSF),\nincluding its outer wings, is critical for the method. A database of MegaCam\nPSF models corresponding to different seeing conditions and bands was generated\ndirectly from the deep images. It is shown that the difference in the PSFs in\ndifferent bands causes artificial changes in the color profiles, in particular\na reddening of the outskirts of galaxies having a bright nucleus. The method is\nvalidated with a set of simulated images and applied to three representative\ntest cases: NGC 3599, NGC 3489, and NGC 4274, and exhibiting for two of them a\nprominent ghost halo. The method successfully removes it.\n", "  Many massive star forming disc galaxies in the redshift range 3 to 0.5 are\nobserved to have a clumpy morphology showing giant clumps of size $\\sim$1 kpc\nand masses of about $10^7M_{\\odot}$ to $10^{10} M_{\\odot}$. The nature and fate\nof these giant clumps is still under debate. In this work we use 19\nhigh-resolution simulations of disc galaxies from the NIHAO sample to study the\nformation and the evolution of clumps in the discs of high redshift galaxies.\nWe use mock HST - CANDELS observations created with the radiative transfer code\nGRASIL-3D to carry out, for the first time, a quantitative comparison of the\nobserved fraction of clumpy galaxies and its evolution with redshift with\nsimulations. We find a good agreement between the observed clumpy fraction and\nthe one of the NIHAO galaxies. We find that dust attenuation can suppress\nintrinsically bright clumps and enhance less luminous ones. In our galaxy\nsample we only find clumps in light (u-band) from young stars but not in\nstellar mass surface density maps. This means that the NIHAO sample does not\nshow clumpy stellar discs but rather a clumpy light distribution originating\nfrom clumpy star formation events. The clumps found in the NIHAO sample match\nobserved age/color gradients as a function of distance from the galaxy center\nbut they show no sign of inward migration. Clumps in our simulations disperse\non timescales of a about a hundred Myr and their contribution to bulge growth\nis negligible.\n", "  Appealing to an analytical result from mean-field theory, we show, using a\ngeneric galaxy model, that galactic dynamo action can be suppressed by\nsmall-scale magnetic fluctuations. This is caused by the magnetic analogue of\nthe R\\\"{a}dler or $\\Omega\\times J$ effect, where rotation-induced corrections\nto the mean-field turbulent transport result in what we interpret to be an\neffective reduction of the standard $\\alpha$ effect in the presence of\nsmall-scale magnetic fields.\n", "  We numerically calculate the local density of states (LDOS) of a\none-dimensional Mott insulator with open boundaries, which is modelled\nmicroscopically by a (extended) Hubbard chain at half filling. In the Fourier\ntransform of the LDOS we identify several dispersing features corresponding to\npropagating charge and spin degrees of freedom, thus providing a visualisation\nof the spin-charge separation in the system. We also consider the effect of an\nadditional boundary potential, which, if sufficiently strong, leads to the\nformation of a boundary bound state which is clearly visible in the LDOS as a\nnon-dispersing feature inside the Mott gap.\n", "  The center of the Milky Way is predicted to be the brightest region of\ngamma-rays generated by self-annihilating dark matter particles. Excess\nemission about the Galactic center above predictions made for standard\nastrophysical processes has been observed in gamma-ray data collected by the\nFermi Large Area Telescope. It is well described by the square of an NFW dark\nmatter density distribution. Although other interpretations for the excess are\nplausible, the possibility that it arises from annihilating dark matter is\nvalid. In this paper, we characterize the excess emission as annihilating dark\nmatter in the framework of an effective field theory. We consider the\npossibility that the annihilation process is mediated by either pseudo-scalar\nor vector interactions and constrain the coupling strength of these\ninteractions by fitting to the Fermi Large Area Telescope data for energies\n1-100 GeV in the 15 x 15 degree region about the Galactic center using\nself-consistently derived interstellar emission models and point source lists\nfor the region. The excess persists and its spectral characteristics favor a\ndark matter particle with a mass in the range approximately from 50 to 190 (10\nto 90) GeV and annihilation cross section approximately from 1E-26 to 4E-25\n(6E-27 to 2E-25) cm^3/s for pseudo-scalar (vector) interactions. We map these\nintervals into the corresponding WIMP-neutron scattering cross sections and\nfind that the allowed range lies well below current and projected direct\ndetection constraints for pseudo-scalar interactions, but are typically ruled\nout for vector interactions.\n", "  The interpolation from supersymmetric to non-supersymmetric heterotic\ntheories is studied, via the Scherk-Schwarz compactification of supersymmetric\n6D theories to 4D. A general modular-invariant Scherk-Schwarz deformation is\ndeduced from the properties of the 6D theories at the endpoints, which\nsignificantly extends previously known examples. This wider class of\nnon-supersymmetric 4D theories opens up new possibilities for model building.\nThe full one-loop cosmological constant of such theories is studied as a\nfunction of compactification radius for a number of cases, and the following\ninterpolating configurations are found: two supersymmetric 6D theories related\nby a T-duality transformation, with intermediate 4D maximum or minimum at the\nstring scale; a non-supersymmetric 6D theory interpolating to a supersymmetric\n6D theory, with the 4D theory possibly having an AdS minimum; a \"metastable\"\nnon-supersymmetric 6D theory interpolating via a 4D theory to a supersymmetric\n6D theory.\n", "  The annihilation of dark matter particles in the galactic halo of the Milky\nWay may lead to cosmic ray signatures that can be probed by the AMS-02\nexperiment, which has measured the composition and fluxes of charged cosmic\nrays with unprecedented precision. Given the absence of characteristic spectral\nfeatures in the electron and positron fluxes measured by AMS-02, we derive\nupper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section for leptophilic dark\nmatter models. Our limits are based on a new background model that describes\nall recent measurements of the energy spectra of cosmic ray positrons and\nelectrons. For thermal dark matter relics, we can exclude dark matter masses\nbelow about 100 GeV. We include the radiation of electroweak gauge bosons in\nthe dark matter annihilation process and compute the antiproton signal that can\nbe expected within leptophilic dark matter models.\n", "  We study numerically the density profile in the six-vertex model with domain\nwall boundary conditions. Using a Monte Carlo algorithm originally proposed by\nAllison and Reshetikhin we numerically evaluate the inhomogeneous density\nprofiles in the disordered and antiferromagnetic regimes where frozen corners\nappear. At the free fermion point we present an exact finite-size formula for\nthe density on the horizontal edges that relies on the imaginary time transfer\nmatrix approach. In all cases where exact analytic forms for the density and\nthe arctic curves are known the numerical method shows perfect agreement with\nthem. This also suggests the possibility of its use for accurate quantitative\npurposes.\n", "  We compute the vacuum polarization of a massless minimally co pled scalar\nfield in a background given by a black hole with subtracted geometry. Extending\nprevious results for the horizon of rotating black holes with no charge, we\nobtain an analytical expression for the vacuum polarization that is valid\nthroughout the spacetime and for arbitrary rotation and charge parameters. The\nvacuum polarization diverges at the inner horizon and the quantum state cannot\nbe extended to the inside of it.\n", "  The evolution of massive stars surviving the red supergiant (RSG) stage\nremains unexplored due to the rarity of such objects. The yellow hypergiants\n(YHGs) appear to be the warm counterparts of post-RSG classes located near the\nHumphreys-Davidson upper luminosity limit, which are characterized by\natmospheric instability and high mass-loss rates. We aim to increase the number\nof YHGs in M33 and thus to contribute to a better understanding of the\npre-supernova evolution of massive stars. Optical spectroscopy of five\ndust-enshrouded YSGs selected from mid-IR criteria was obtained with the goal\nof detecting evidence of extensive atmospheres. We also analyzed BVI photometry\nfor 21 of the most luminous YSGs in M33 to identify changes in the spectral\ntype. To explore the properties of circumstellar dust, we performed SED-fitting\nof multi-band photometry of the 21 YSGs. We find three luminous YSGs in our\nsample to be YHG candidates, as they are surrounded by hot dust and are\nenshrouded within extended, cold dusty envelopes. Our spectroscopy of star 2\nshows emission of more than one H$\\alpha$ component, as well as emission of\nCaII, implying an extended atmospheric structure. In addition, the long-term\nmonitoring of the star reveals a dimming in the visual light curve of amplitude\nlarger than 0.5 mag that caused an apparent drop in the temperature that\nexceeded 500 K. We suggest the observed variability to be analogous to that of\nthe Galactic YHG $\\rho$ Cas. Five less luminous YSGs are suggested as post-RSG\ncandidates showing evidence of hot or/and cool dust emission. We demonstrate\nthat mid-IR photometry, combined with optical spectroscopy and time-series\nphotometry, provide a robust method for identifying candidate YHGs. Future\ndiscovery of YHGs in Local Group galaxies is critical for the study of the late\nevolution of intermediate-mass massive stars.\n", "  We evaluate the pion-nucleon intermediate-state contribution to the\ntwo-photon exchange (TPE) correction in the elastic electron-nucleon scattering\nwithin a dispersive framework. We calculate the contribution from all $\\pi N$\npartial waves using the MAID parametrization. We provide the corresponding TPE\ncorrection to the unpolarized $e p$ scattering cross section in the region of\nlow momentum transfer $ Q^2 \\lesssim 0.064~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$, where no analytical\ncontinuation into the unphysical region of the TPE scattering amplitudes is\nrequired. We compare our result in the forward angular region with an\nalternative TPE calculation, in terms of structure functions, and find a good\nagreement, indicating a small contribution at low $Q^2$ due to discontinuities\nbeyond $ \\pi N$. We also compare our results with empirical fits.\n", "  Given an orthonormal basis in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space and a unital\nquantum operation $\\cal E$ acting on it one can define a non-linear mapping\nthat associates to $\\cal E$ a $d\\times d$ real-valued matrix that we call the\nCoherence Matrix of $\\cal E$ with respect to $B$. We show that one can use this\ncoherence matrix to define vast families of measures of the coherence\ngenerating power (CGP) of the operation. These measures have a natural\ngeometrical interpretation as separation of $\\cal E$ from the set of incoherent\nunital operations. The probabilistic approach to CGP discussed in P. Zanardi et\nal., arXiv:1610.00217 can be reformulated and generalized introducing,\nalongside the coherence matrix, another $d\\times d$ real-valued matrix, the\nSimplex Correlation Matrix. This matrix describes the relevant statistical\ncorrelations in the input ensemble of incoherent states. Contracting these two\nmatrices one finds CGP measures associated with the process of preparing the\ngiven incoherent ensemble and processing it with the chosen unital operation.\nFinally, in the unitary case, we discuss how these concepts can be made\ncompatible with an underlying tensor product structure by defining families of\nCGP measures that are additive.\n", "  We report a simultaneous measurement of a longitudinal spin Seebeck effect\n(LSSE) and thermal conductivity in a Pt/${\\rm Y_{3}Fe_{5}O_{12}}$ (YIG)/Pt\nsystem in a temperature range from 10 to 300 K. By directly monitoring the\ntemperature difference in the system, we excluded thermal artifacts in the LSSE\nmeasurements. It is found that both the LSSE signal and the thermal\nconductivity of YIG exhibit sharp peaks at the same temperature, differently\nfrom previous reports. The maximum LSSE coefficient is found to be\n$S{\\rm_{LSSE}}>10\\ \\mu{\\rm V/K}$, one-order-of magnitude greater than the\npreviously reported values. The concomitant enhancement of the LSSE and thermal\nconductivity of YIG suggests the strong correlation between magnon and phonon\ntransport in the LSSE.\n", "  We study the controlled manipulation of the Jahn-Teller metal state of\nfulleride compounds using nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory. This\nanomalous metallic state is a spontaneous orbital-selective Mott phase, which\nis characterized by one metallic and two insulating orbitals. Using protocols\nbased on transiently reduced hopping amplitudes or periodic electric fields, we\ndemonstrate the possibility to switch orbitals between Mott insulating and\nmetallic on a sub-picosecond timescale, and to rotate the order parameter\nbetween three equivalent states that can be distinguished by their anisotropic\nconductance. The Jahn-Teller metal phase of alkali-doped fullerides thus\nprovides a promising platform for ultrafast persistent memory devices.\n", "  We studied parity-time (PT) symmetric trimer systems that feature open and\nclosed boundaries. The exceptional point is three-state coalescence at zero\nenergy because of chiral symmetry in the open trimer; however, two-state\ncoalescence appears in the closed trimer affected by the magnetic flux\nenclosed, which suppresses the PT transition. Dynamics at the phase transition\npoint were also qualitatively studied. For three-state coalescence, the\nprobability of an initial state increases in a power law. The highest order is\nfour; however, it can be reduced to two for the state that is only relevant to\none associated state. For two-state coalescence in the trimer ring, we found\nfour typical dynamical behaviors of state probability: (i) unchanged, (ii)\noscillation, (iii) quadratic increase, and (iv) quadratic increase with\noscillation. The scattering properties of the trimer systems were also studied,\nparticularly, asymmetric wave emissions at spectral singularities\n", "  We present a sample of 48 metal-poor galaxies at $ z < 0.14$ selected from\n92,510 galaxies in the LAMOST survey. These galaxies are identified for their\ndetection of the auroral emission line \\oiii$\\lambda$4363 above $3\\sigma$\nlevel, which allows a direct measurement of the electron temperature and the\noxygen abundance. The emission line fluxes are corrected for internal dust\nextinction using Balmer decrement method. With electron temperature derived\nfrom \\oiii$\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007/\\oiii\\lambda4363$ and electron density from\n$\\sii\\lambda6731/\\sii\\lambda6717$, we obtain the oxygen abundances in our\nsample which range from $\\zoh= 7.63$ (0.09 $\\Zsun$) to $8.46$ (0.6 $\\Zsun$). We\nfind an extremely metal-poor galaxy with $\\zoh=7.63 \\pm 0.01$. With multiband\nphotometric data from FUV to NIR and $\\ha$ measurements, we also determine the\nstellar masses and star formation rates, based on the spectral energy\ndistribution fitting and $\\ha$ luminosity, respectively. We find that our\ngalaxies have low and intermediate stellar masses with $\\rm 6.39 \\le\nlog(M/M_{\\sun})\\le 9.27$, and high star formation rates (SFRs) with $\\rm -2.18\n\\le log(SFR/M_{\\sun} yr^{-1}) \\le 1.95$. We also find that the metallicities of\nour galaxies are consistent with the local $T_e$-based mass-metallicity\nrelation, while the scatter is about 0.28 dex. Additionally, assuming the\ncoefficient of $\\rm \\alpha =0.66$, we find most of our galaxies follow the\nlocal mass-metallicity-SFR relation, while a scatter about 0.24 dex exists,\nsuggesting the mass-metallicity relation is weakly dependent on SFR for those\nmetal-poor galaxies.\n", "  We study the topological classification of parafermionic chains in the\npresence of a modified time reversal symmetry that satisfies ${\\cal T}^2=1 $.\nSuch chains can be realized in one dimensional structures embedded in\nfractionalized two dimensional states of matter, e.g. at the edges of a\nfractional quantum spin Hall system, where counter propagating modes may be\ngapped either by back-scattering or by coupling to a superconductor. In the\nabsence of any additional symmetries, a chain of $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ parafermions\ncan belong to one of several distinct phases. We find that when the modified\ntime reversal symmetry is imposed, the classification becomes richer. If $m $\nis odd, each of the phases splits into two subclasses. We identify the symmetry\nprotected phase as a Haldane phase that carries a Kramers doublet at each end.\nWhen $m $ is even, each phase splits into four subclasses. The origin of this\nsplit is in the emergent Majorana fermions associated with even values of $m$.\nWe demonstrate the appearance of such emergent Majorana zero modes in a system\nwhere the constituents particles are either fermions or bosons.\n", "  We demonstrate cavity cooling of all motional degrees of freedom of an atomic\nensemble using light that is far detuned from the atomic transitions by several\ngigahertz. The cooling is achieved by cavity-induced frequency-dependent\nasymmetric enhancement of the atomic emission spectrum, thereby extracting\nthermal kinetic energy from the atomic system. Within $100 ~\\mathrm{ms}$, the\natomic temperature is reduced from $200 ~\\mu\\mathrm{K}$ to $10 ~\\mu\\mathrm{K}$,\nwhere the final temperature is mainly limited by the linewidth of the cavity.\nIn principle, the technique can be applied to molecules and atoms with complex\ninternal energy structure.\n", "  Whenever the integrand of a gauge-theory loop amplitude can be arranged into\na form where the BCJ duality between color and kinematics is manifest, a\ncorresponding gravity integrand can be obtained simply via the double-copy\nprocedure. However, finding such gauge-theory representations can be\nchallenging, especially at high loop orders. Here we show that we can instead\nstart from generic gauge-theory integrands, where the duality is not manifest,\nand apply a modified double-copy procedure to obtain gravity integrands that\ninclude contact terms generated by violations of dual Jacobi identities. We\nillustrate this with three-, four- and five-loop examples in N=8 supergravity.\n", "  We present 1.05 mm ALMA observations of the deeply embedded high-mass\nprotocluster G11.92-0.61, designed to search for low-mass cores within the\naccretion reservoir of the massive protostars. Our ALMA mosaic, which covers an\nextent of ~0.7 pc at sub-arcsecond (~1400 au) resolution, reveals a rich\npopulation of 16 new millimetre continuum sources surrounding the three\npreviously-known millimetre cores. Most of the new sources are located in the\nouter reaches of the accretion reservoir: the median projected separation from\nthe central, massive (proto)star MM1 is ~0.17 pc. The derived physical\nproperties of the new millimetre continuum sources are consistent with those of\nlow-mass prestellar and protostellar cores in nearby star-forming regions: the\nmedian mass, radius, and density of the new sources are 1.3 Msun, 1600 au, and\nn(H2)~10^7 cm^-3. At least three of the low-mass cores in G11.92-0.61 drive\nmolecular outflows, traced by high-velocity 12CO(3-2) (observed with the SMA)\nand/or by H2CO and CH3OH emission (observed with ALMA). This finding, combined\nwith the known outflow/accretion activity of MM1, indicates that high- and\nlow-mass stars are forming (accreting) simultaneously within this protocluster.\nOur ALMA results are consistent with the predictions of\ncompetitive-accretion-type models in which high-mass stars form along with\ntheir surrounding clusters.\n", "  Many topics in planetary studies demand an estimate of the collision\nprobability of two objects moving on nearly Keplerian orbits. In the classic\nworks of \\\"Opik (1951) and Wetherill (1967), the collision probability was\nderived by linearizing the motion near the collision points, and there is now a\nvast literature using their method. We present here a simpler and more\nphysically motivated derivation for non-tangential collisions in Keplerian\norbits, as well as for tangential collisions that were not previously\nconsidered. Our formulas have the added advantage of being manifestly symmetric\nin the parameters of the two colliding bodies. In common with the\n\\\"Opik-Wetherill treatments, we linearize the motion of the bodies in the\nvicinity of the point of orbit intersection (or near the points of minimum\ndistance between the two orbits) and assume a uniform distribution of impact\nparameter within the collision radius. We point out that the linear\napproximation leads to singular results for the case of tangential encounters.\nWe regularize this singularity by use of a parabolic approximation of the\nmotion in the vicinity of a tangential encounter.\n", "  We investigate the interplay of Coulomb interactions and\nshort-range-correlated disorder in three dimensional systems where absent\ndisorder the non-interacting band structure hosts a quadratic band crossing.\nThough the clean Coulomb problem is believed to host a 'non-Fermi liquid'\nphase, disorder and Coulomb interactions have the same scaling dimension in a\nrenormalization group (RG) sense, and thus should be treated on an equal\nfooting. We therefore implement a controlled $\\epsilon$-expansion and apply it\nat leading order to derive RG flow equations valid when disorder and\ninteractions are both weak. We find that the non-Fermi liquid fixed point is\nunstable to disorder, and demonstrate that the problem inevitably flows to\nstrong coupling, outside the regime of applicability of the perturbative RG. An\nexamination of the flow to strong coupling suggests that disorder is\nasymptotically more important than interactions, so that the low energy\nbehavior of the system can be described by a non-interacting sigma model in the\nappropriate symmetry class (which depends on whether exact particle-hole\nsymmetry is imposed on the problem). We close with a discussion of general\nprinciples unveiled by our analysis that dictate the interplay of disorder and\nCoulomb interactions in gapless semiconductors, and of connections to many-body\nlocalized systems with long-range interactions.\n", "  The young (~2 Myr) cluster Chamaeleon I is one of the closest laboratories to\nstudy the early stages of star cluster dynamics in a low-density environment.\nWe studied its structural and kinematical properties combining parameters from\nthe high-resolution spectroscopic survey Gaia-ESO with data from the\nliterature. Our main result is the evidence of a large discrepancy between the\nvelocity dispersion (sigma = 1.14 \\pm 0.35 km s^{-1}) of the stellar population\nand the dispersion of the pre-stellar cores (~0.3 km s^{-1}) derived from\nsubmillimeter observations. The origin of this discrepancy, which has been\nobserved in other young star clusters is not clear. It may be due to either the\neffect of the magnetic field on the protostars and the filaments, or to the\ndynamical evolution of stars driven by two-body interactions. Furthermore, the\nanalysis of the kinematic properties of the stellar population put in evidence\na significant velocity shift (~1 km s^{-1}) between the two sub-clusters\nlocated around the North and South main clouds. This result further supports a\nscenario, where clusters form from the evolution of multiple substructures\nrather than from a monolithic collapse.\n  Using three independent spectroscopic indicators (the gravity indicator\n$\\gamma$, the equivalent width of the Li line, and the H_alpha 10\\% width), we\nperformed a new membership selection. We found six new cluster members located\nin the outer region of the cluster. Starting from the positions and masses of\nthe cluster members, we derived the level of substructure Q, the surface\ndensity \\Sigma and the level of mass segregation $\\Lambda_{MSR}$ of the\ncluster. The comparison between these structural properties and the results of\nN-body simulations suggests that the cluster formed in a low density\nenvironment, in virial equilibrium or supervirial, and highly substructured.\n", "  We renormalize the two-body contact interaction based on the exact solution\nof two interacting particles in a harmonic trap. This renormalization extends\nthe validity of the contact interaction to large scattering lengths. We apply\nthis renormalized interaction to a degenerate unitary Bose gas to study its\nstationary properties and elementary excitations using the mean-field theory\nand the hyperspherical method. Since the scattering length is no longer a\nrelevant length scale at unitarity, universal properties are obtained that\ndepend only on the average particle density. Our treatment shows that the\nuniversal relations for the total energy and for the two-body contact are\n$E/N=12.67\\hbar^2\\langle n^{2/3}\\rangle/2m$ and $C_{2}/N=11.8\\langle\nn^{1/3}\\rangle$ respectively.\n", "  We report on the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) behavior of heavy\nmetal (HM)/ Fe alloy/MgO thin film heterostructures after an ultrathin HfO2\npassivation layer is inserted between the Fe alloy and the MgO. This is\naccomplished by depositing one to two atomic layers of Hf onto the Fe alloy\nbefore the subsequent rf sputter deposition of the MgO layer. This Hf layer is\nfully oxidized during the subsequent deposition of the MgO layer, as confirmed\nby X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. As the result a strong\ninterfacial perpendicular anisotropy energy density can be achieved without any\npost-fabrication annealing treatment, for example 1.7 erg/cm^2 for the\nTa/Fe60Co20B20/HfO2/MgO heterostructure. Depending on the HM, further\nenhancements of the PMA can be realized by thermal annealing to at least 400C.\nWe show that ultra-thin HfO2 layers offer a range of options for enhancing the\nmagnetic properties of magnetic heterostructures for spintronics applications.\n", "  The model of a double-well oscillator with nonlinear dissipation is studied.\nThe self-sustained oscillations regime and the excitable one are described. The\nfirst regime consists in the coexistence of two stable limit cycles in the\nphase space, which correspond to the self-sustained oscillations of the point\nmass in either potential well. The self-sustained oscillations do not occur in\na noise-free system in the excitable regime, but appropriate conditions for\ncoherence resonance in either potential well can be achieved. The stochastic\ndynamics in both two regimes is researched by using numerical simulation and\nelectronic circuit implementation of the considered system. Multiple\nqualitative changes of the probability density function (PDF) caused by noise\nintensity varying are explained by using the phase space structure of the\ndeterministic system.\n", "  We investigate single photon scattering properties in one-dimensional\nwaveguide coupled to quantum emitter's chain with dipole-dipole interaction\n(DDI). The photon transport is extremely sensitive to the location of the\nevanescently coupled emitters. The analytical expressions of reflection and\ntransmission amplitudes for the chain containing two emitters with DDI are\ndeduced by using real-space Hamiltonian. Two cases, where the two emitters\nsymmetrically and asymmetrically couple to the waveguide, are discussed in\ndetail. It shows that the reflection and transmission typical spectra split\ninto two peaks due to the DDI. The Fano minimum in the spectra can also be used\nto estimate the strength of the DDI. Furthermore, the DDI makes spectra\nstrongly asymmetric and create a transmission window in the region where there\nwas zero transmission. The scattering spectra for the chain consisting of\nmulti-emitters are also given. Our key finding is that DDI can broaden the\nfrequency band width for high reflection when the chain consists of many\nemitters.\n", "  Recent pump-probe experiments demonstrate the possibility that Dirac\nmaterials may be driven into transient excited states describable by two\nchemical potentials, one for the electrons and one for the holes. Given the\nDirac nature of the spectrum, such an inverted population allows the optical\ntunability of the density of states of the electrons and holes, effectively\noffering control of the strength of the Coulomb interaction. Here we discuss\nthe feasibility of realizing transient excitonic instabilities in\noptically-pumped Dirac materials. We demonstrate, theoretically, the reduction\nof the critical coupling leading to the formation of a transient condensate of\nelectron-hole pairs and identify signatures of this state. Furthermore, we\nprovide guidelines for experiments by both identifying the regimes in which\nsuch exotic many-body states are more likely to be observed and estimating the\nmagnitude of the excitonic gap for a few important examples of existing Dirac\nmaterials. We find a set of material parameters for which our theory predicts\nlarge gaps and high critical temperatures and which could be realized in future\nDirac materials. We also comment on transient excitonic instabilities in\nthree-dimensional Dirac and Weyl semimetals. This study provides the first\nexample of a transient collective instability in driven Dirac materials.\n", "  A revolution in galaxy cluster science is only a few years away. The survey\nmachines eROSITA and Euclid will provide cluster samples of never-before-seen\nstatistical quality. XMM-Newton will be the key instrument to exploit these\nrich datasets in terms of detailed follow-up of the cluster hot gas content,\nsystematically characterizing sub-samples as well as exotic new objects.\n", "  We consider the Bradlow equation for vortices which was recently found by\nManton and find a two-parameter class of analytic solutions in closed form on\nnontrivial geometries with non-constant curvature. The general solution to our\nclass of metrics is given by a hypergeometric function and the area of the\nvortex domain by the Gaussian hypergeometric function.\n", "  We present the discovery and spectrophotometric characterization of a large\nsample of 164 faint ($i_{AB}$ $\\sim$ $23$-$25$ mag) star-forming dwarf galaxies\n(SFDGs) at redshift $0.13$ $\\leq z \\leq$ $0.88$ selected by the presence of\nbright optical emission lines in the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS). We\ninvestigate their integrated physical properties and ionization conditions,\nwhich are used to discuss the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation\n(MZR) and other key scaling relations. We use optical VUDS spectra in the\nCOSMOS, VVDS-02h, and ECDF-S fields, as well as deep multiwavelength\nphotometry, to derive stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR) and gas-phase\nmetallicities. The VUDS SFDGs are compact (median $r_{e}$ $\\sim$ $1.2$ kpc),\nlow-mass ($M_{*}$ $\\sim$ $10^7-10^9$ $M_{\\odot}$) galaxies with a wide range of\nstar formation rates (SFR($H\\alpha$) $\\sim 10^{-3}-10^{1}$ $M_{\\odot}/yr$) and\nmorphologies. Overall, they show a broad range of subsolar metallicities\n(12+log(O/H)=$7.26$-$8.7$; $0.04$ $\\lesssim Z/Z_{\\odot} \\lesssim$ $1$). The MZR\nof SFDGs shows a flatter slope compared to previous studies of galaxies in the\nsame mass range and redshift. We find the scatter of the MZR partly explained\nin the low mass range by varying specific SFRs and gas fractions amongst the\ngalaxies in our sample. Compared with simple chemical evolution models we find\nthat most SFDGs do not follow the predictions of a \"closed-box\" model, but\nthose from a gas regulating model in which gas flows are considered. While\nstrong stellar feedback may produce large-scale outflows favoring the cessation\nof vigorous star formation and promoting the removal of metals, younger and\nmore metal-poor dwarfs may have recently accreted large amounts of fresh, very\nmetal-poor gas, that is used to fuel current star formation.\n", "  Double layer two-dimensional electron systems at high perpendicular magnetic\nfield are used to realize magnetic tunnel junctions in which the electrons at\nthe Fermi level in the two layers have either parallel or anti-parallel spin\nmagnetizations. In the anti-parallel case the tunnel junction, at low\ntemperatures, behaves as a nearly ideal spin diode. At elevated temperatures\nthe diode character degrades as long-wavelength spin waves are thermally\nexcited. These tunnel junctions provide a demonstration that the spin\npolarization of the electrons in the $N=1$ Landau level at filling factors $\\nu\n= 5/2$ and 7/2 is essentially complete, and, with the aid of an in-plane\nmagnetic field component, that Landau level mixing at these filling factors is\nweak in the samples studied.\n", "  XMM-Newton has deeply changed our picture of X-ray emission of hot, massive\nstars. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy as well as monitoring of these\nobjects helped us gain a deeper insight into the physics of single massive\nstars with or without magnetic fields, as well as of massive binary systems,\nwhere the stellar winds of both stars interact. These observations also\nrevealed a number of previously unexpected features that challenge our\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the stellar winds of massive stars. I briefly\nsummarize the results obtained over the past 15 years and highlight the\nperspectives for the next decade. It is anticipated that coordinated (X-ray and\noptical or UV) monitoring and time-critical observations of either single or\nbinary massive stars will become the most important topics in this field over\nthe coming years. Synergies with existing or forthcoming X-ray observatories\n(NuSTAR, Swift, eROSITA) will also play a major role and will further enhance\nthe importance of XMM-Newton in our quest for understanding the physics of hot,\nmassive stars.\n", "  We device a new method to calculate a large number of Mellin moments of\nsingle scale quantities using the systems of differential and/or difference\nequations obtained by integration-by-parts identities between the corresponding\nFeynman integrals of loop corrections to physical quantities. These scalar\nquantities have a much simpler mathematical structure than the complete\nquantity. A sufficiently large set of moments may even allow the analytic\nreconstruction of the whole quantity considered, holding in case of first order\nfactorizing systems. In any case, one may derive highly precise numerical\nrepresentations in general using this method, which is otherwise completely\nanalytic.\n", "  We study timelike and null geodesics in a non-singular black hole metric\nproposed by Hayward. The metric contains an additional length-scale parameter\n$\\ell$ and approaches the Schwarzschild metric at large radii while approaches\na constant at small radii so that the singularity is resolved. We tabulate the\nvarious critical values of $\\ell$ for timelike and null geodesics: the critical\nvalues for the existence of horizon, marginally stable circular orbit and\nphoton sphere. We find the photon sphere exists even if the horizon is absent\nand two marginally stable circular orbits appear if the photon sphere is absent\nand a stable circular orbit for photons exists for a certain range of $\\ell$.\nWe visualize the image of a black hole and find that blight rings appear even\nif the photon sphere is absent.\n", "  Superconducting circuit technologies have recently achieved quantum protocols\ninvolving closed feedback loops. Quantum artificial intelligence and quantum\nmachine learning are emerging fields inside quantum technologies which may\nenable quantum devices to acquire information from the outer world and improve\nthemselves via a learning process. Here we propose the implementation of basic\nprotocols in quantum reinforcement learning, with superconducting circuits\nemploying feedback-loop control. We introduce diverse scenarios for\nproof-of-principle experiments with state-of-the-art superconducting circuit\ntechnologies and analyze their feasibility in presence of imperfections. The\nfield of quantum artificial intelligence implemented with superconducting\ncircuits paves the way for enhanced quantum control and quantum computation\nprotocols.\n", "  We consider the evolution of an outburst in a uniform medium under spherical\nsymmetry, having in mind AGN feedback in the intra cluster medium (ICM). For a\ngiven density and pressure of the medium, the spatial structure and energy\npartition at a given time $t_{age}$ (since the onset of the outburst) are fully\ndetermined by the total injected energy $E_{inj}$ and the duration $t_b$ of the\noutburst. We are particularly interested in the late phase evolution when the\nstrong shock transforms into a sound wave. We studied the energy partition\nduring such transition with different combinations of $E_{inj}$ and $t_b$. For\nan instantaneous outburst with $t_b\\rightarrow 0$, which corresponds to the\nextension of classic Sedov-Taylor solution with counter-pressure, the fraction\nof energy that can be carried away by sound waves is $\\lesssim$12% of\n$E_{inj}$. As $t_b$ increases, the solution approaches the \"slow piston\" limit,\nwith the fraction of energy in sound waves approaching zero. We then repeat the\nsimulations using radial density and temperature profiles measured in Perseus\nand M87/Virgo clusters. We find that the results with a uniform medium broadly\nreproduce an outburst in more realistic conditions once proper scaling is\napplied. We also develop techniques to map intrinsic properties of an outburst\n$(E_{inj}, t_b$ and $t_{age})$ to the observables like the Mach number of the\nshock and radii of the shock and ejecta. For the Perseus cluster and M87, the\nestimated $(E_{inj}, t_b$ and $t_{age})$ agree with numerical simulations\ntailored for these objects with $20-30\\%$ accuracy.\n", "  We study the general Zee model, which includes an extra Higgs scalar doublet\nand a new singly-charged scalar singlet. Neutrino masses are generated at\none-loop level, and in order to describe leptonic mixing, both the Standard\nModel and the extra Higgs scalar doublets need to couple to leptons (in a\ntype-III two-Higgs doublet model), which necessarily generates large lepton\nflavor violating signals, also in Higgs decays. Imposing all relevant\nphenomenological constraints and performing a full numerical scan of the\nparameter space, we find that both normal and inverted neutrino mass orderings\ncan be fitted, although the latter is disfavored with respect to the former. In\nfact, inverted ordering can only be accommodated if $\\theta_{23}$ turns out to\nbe in the first octant. A branching ratio for $h \\to \\tau \\mu$ of up to\n$10^{-2}$ is allowed, but it could be as low as $10^{-6}$. In addition, if\nfuture expected sensitivities of $\\tau\\to \\mu\\gamma$ are achieved, normal\nordering can be almost completely tested. Also, $\\mu e$ conversion is expected\nto probe large parts of the parameter space, excluding completely inverted\nordering if no signal is observed. Furthermore, non-standard neutrino\ninteractions are found to be smaller than $10^{-6}$, which is well below future\nexperimental sensitivity. Finally, the results of our scan indicate that the\nmasses of the additional scalars have to be below $2.5$ TeV, and typically they\nare lower than that and therefore within the reach of the LHC and future\ncolliders.\n", "  We describe the spin and charge dynamics of the system of two electrons\nconfined within a double quantum dot defined in a quantum wire. The spin\ndynamics is driven by the electron motion in presence of the spin-orbit\ninteraction and the randomly varying local Overhauser field due to the nuclear\nspins. The Schroedinger equation is solved with the time-dependent\nconfiguration interaction method that allows for an exact description of the\nsystem dynamics. The procedures of the spin separation, exchange and read-out\nby the spin to charge conversion all induced by the detuning variation are\nsimulated. The rates of the potential variation that are necessary for the spin\nseparation and spin to charge conversion in the context of the Landau-Zener\ntransitions are determined. The average over random configurations of the\nhyperfine field produce spin exchange results which qualitatively agree with\nthe experimental data.\n", "  Transport barrier formation and its relation to sheared flows in fluids and\nplasmas are of fundamental interest in various natural and laboratory\nobservations and of critical importance in achieving an economical energy\nproduction in a magnetic fusion device. Here we report the first observation of\nan edge transport barrier formation event in a gyrokinetic simulation carried\nout in a realistic tokamak edge geometry. The results show that turbulent\nReynolds stress driven sheared ExB flows act in concert with neoclassical orbit\nloss to quench turbulent transport and form a transport barrier just inside the\nlast closed magnetic flux surface.\n", "  Dedicated photometric and spectroscopic surveys have provided unambiguous\nevidence for a strong stellar mass-size evolution of galaxies within the last\n10 Gyr. The likely progenitors of today's most massive galaxies are remarkably\nsmall, disky, passive and have already assembled much of their stellar mass at\nredshift z=2. An in-depth analysis of these objects, however, is currently not\nfeasible due to the lack of high-quality, spatially-resolved photometric and\nspectroscopic data. In this paper, we present a sample of nearby compact\nelliptical galaxies (CEGs), which bear resemblance to the massive and quiescent\ngalaxy population at earlier times. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and wide-field\nintegral field unit (IFU) data have been obtained, and are used to constrain\norbit-based dynamical models and stellar population synthesis (SPS) fits, to\nunravel their structural and dynamical properties. We first show that our\ngalaxies are outliers in the present-day stellar mass-size relation. They are,\nhowever, consistent with the mass-size relation of compact, massive and\nquiescent galaxies at redshift z=2. The compact sizes of our nearby galaxies\nimply high central stellar mass surface densities, which are also in agreement\nwith the massive galaxy population at higher redshift, hinting at strong\ndissipational processes during their formation. Corroborating evidence for a\nlargely passive evolution within the last 10 Gyr is provided by their orbital\ndistribution as well as their stellar populations, which are difficult to\nreconcile with a very active (major) merging history. This all supports that we\ncan use nearby CEGs as local analogues of the high-redshift, massive and\nquiescent galaxy population, thus providing additional constraints for models\nof galaxy formation and evolution.\n", "  We use globular cluster kinematics data, primarily from the SLUGGS survey, to\nmeasure the dark matter fraction ($f_{\\rm DM}$) and the average dark matter\ndensity ($\\left< \\rho_{\\rm DM} \\right>$) within the inner 5 effective radii\n($R_{\\rm e}$) for 32 nearby early--type galaxies (ETGs) with stellar mass log\n$(M_*/\\rm M_\\odot)$ ranging from $10.1$ to $11.8$. We compare our results with\na simple galaxy model based on scaling relations as well as with cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations where the dark matter profile has been modified\nthrough various physical processes.\n  We find a high $f_{\\rm DM}$ ($\\geq0.6$) within 5~$R_{\\rm e}$ in most of our\nsample, which we interpret as a signature of a late mass assembly history that\nis largely devoid of gas-rich major mergers. However, around log $(M_*/M_\\odot)\n\\sim 11$, there is a wide range of $f_{\\rm DM}$ which may be challenging to\nexplain with any single cosmological model. We find tentative evidence that\nlenticulars (S0s), unlike ellipticals, have mass distributions that are similar\nto spiral galaxies, with decreasing $f_{\\rm DM}$ within 5~$R_{\\rm e}$ as galaxy\nluminosity increases. However, we do not find any difference between the\n$\\left< \\rho_{\\rm DM} \\right>$ of S0s and ellipticals in our sample, despite\nthe differences in their stellar populations. We have also used $\\left<\n\\rho_{\\rm DM} \\right>$ to infer the epoch of halo assembly ($z{\\sim}2-4$). By\ncomparing the age of their central stars with the inferred epoch of halo\nformation, we are able to gain more insight into their mass assembly histories.\nOur results suggest a fundamental difference in the dominant late-phase mass\nassembly channel between lenticulars and elliptical galaxies.\n", "  A freely available Python code for modelling SNR evolution has been created.\nThis software is intended for two purposes: to understand SNR evolution; and to\nuse in modelling observations of SNR for obtaining good estimates of SNR\nproperties. It includes all phases for the standard path of evolution for\nspherically symmetric SNRs. In addition, alternate evolutionary models are\navailable, including evolution in a cloudy ISM, the fractional energy loss\nmodel, and evolution in a hot low-density ISM. The graphical interface takes in\nvarious parameters and produces outputs such as shock radius and velocity vs.\ntime, SNR surface brightness profile and spectrum. Some interesting properties\nof SNR evolution are demonstrated using the program.\n", "  We propose a new application of single molecule magnet crystals: their use as\n\"magnetic bubble chambers\" for the direct detection of sub-GeV dark matter. The\nspins in these macroscopic crystals effectively act as independent nano-scale\nmagnets. When anti-aligned with an external magnetic field they form\nmeta-stable states with a relaxation time that can be very long at sufficiently\nlow temperatures. The Zeeman energy stored in this system can be released\nthrough localized heating, caused for example by the scattering or absorption\nof dark matter, resulting in a spin avalanche (or \"magnetic deflagration\") that\namplifies the effects of the initial heat deposit, enabling detection. Much\nlike the temperature and pressure in a conventional bubble chamber, the\ntemperature and external magnetic field set the detection threshold for a\nsingle molecule magnet crystal. We discuss this detector concept for dark\nmatter detection and propose ways to ameliorate backgrounds. If successfully\ndeveloped, this detector concept can search for hidden photon dark matter in\nthe meV - eV mass range with sensitivities exceeding current bounds by several\norders of magnitude.\n", "  Motivated by the absence of signals of new physics in both searches for new\nparticles at LHC and for a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark\nmatter candidate, we consider a scenario where supersymmetry is broken at a\nscale above the reheating temperature. The low energy particle content consists\nthen only in Standard Model states and a gravitino. We investigate the\npossibility that the latter provides the main component of dark matter through\na freeze in mechanism from annihilation of thermalized Standard Model\nparticles. We focus on the case where its production through scattering in the\nthermal plasma is well approximated by the non-linear supersymmetric effective\nLagrangian of the associated goldstino and identify the parameter space allowed\nby the cosmological constraints, allowing the possibility of large reheating\ntemperature compatible with leptogenesis scenarios, alleviating the so called\n\"gravitino problem\".\n", "  We explore the far-field scattering properties of anisotropic 2D materials in\nribbon array configuration. Our study reveals the plasmon-enhanced linear\nbirefringence in these ultrathin metasurfaces, where linearly polarized\nincident light can be scattered into its orthogonal polarization or be\nconverted into circular polarized light. We found wide modulation in both\namplitude and phase of the scattered light via tuning the operating frequency\nor material's anisotropy and develop models to explain the observed scattering\nbehavior.\n", "  We present late-time optical $R$-band imaging data from the Palomar Transient\nFactory (PTF) for the nearby type Ia supernova SN 2011fe. The stacked PTF light\ncurve provides densely sampled coverage down to $R\\simeq22$ mag over 200 to 620\ndays past explosion. Combining with literature data, we estimate the\npseudo-bolometric light curve for this event from 200 to 1600 days after\nexplosion, and constrain the likely near-infrared contribution. This light\ncurve shows a smooth decline consistent with radioactive decay, except over\n~450 to ~600 days where the light curve appears to decrease faster than\nexpected based on the radioactive isotopes presumed to be present, before\nflattening at around 600 days. We model the 200-1600d pseudo-bolometric light\ncurve with the luminosity generated by the radioactive decay chains of\n$^{56}$Ni, $^{57}$Ni and $^{55}$Co, and find it is not consistent with models\nthat have full positron trapping and no infrared catastrophe (IRC); some\nadditional energy escape other than optical/near-IR photons is required.\nHowever, the light curve is consistent with models that allow for positron\nescape (reaching 75% by day 500) and/or an IRC (with 85% of the flux emerging\nin non-optical wavelengths by day 600). The presence of the $^{57}$Ni decay\nchain is robustly detected, but the $^{55}$Co decay chain is not formally\nrequired, with an upper mass limit estimated at 0.014 M$_{\\odot}$. The\nmeasurement of the $^{57}$Ni/$^{56}$Ni mass ratio is subject to significant\nsystematic uncertainties, but all of our fits require a high ratio >0.031 (>1.3\nin solar abundances).\n", "  Cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) are formed by scattering of\nX-ray photons off quantized plasma electrons in the strong magnetic field (of\nthe order 10^12 G) close to the surface of an accreting X-ray pulsar. The line\nprofiles of CRSFs cannot be described by an analytic expression. Numerical\nmethods such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the scattering processes are\nrequired in order to predict precise line shapes for a given physical setup,\nwhich can be compared to observations to gain information about the underlying\nphysics in these systems.\n  A versatile simulation code is needed for the generation of synthetic\ncyclotron lines. Sophisticated geometries should be investigatable by making\ntheir simulation possible for the first time.\n  The simulation utilizes the mean free path tables described in the first\npaper of this series for the fast interpolation of propagation lengths. The\ncode is parallelized to make the very time consuming simulations possible on\nconvenient time scales. Furthermore, it can generate responses to\nmono-energetic photon injections, producing Green's functions, which can be\nused later to generate spectra for arbitrary continua.\n  We develop a new simulation code to generate synthetic cyclotron lines for\ncomplex scenarios, allowing for unprecedented physical interpretation of the\nobserved data. An associated XSPEC model implementation is used to fit\nsynthetic line profiles to NuSTAR data of Cep X-4. The code has been developed\nwith the main goal of overcoming previous geometrical constraints in MC\nsimulations of CRSFs. By applying this code also to more simple, classic\ngeometries used in previous works, we furthermore address issues of code\nverification and cross-comparison of various models. The XSPEC model and the\nGreen's function tables are available online at\nhttp://www.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/research/cyclo .\n", "  We present an amplitude analysis of the decay $D^{0} \\rightarrow K^{-}\n\\pi^{+} \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ based on a data sample of 2.93 ${\\mbox{\\,fb}^{-1}}$\nacquired by the BESIII detector at the $\\psi(3770)$ resonance. With a nearly\nbackground free sample of about 16000 events, we investigate the substructure\nof the decay and determine the relative fractions and the phases among the\ndifferent intermediate processes. Our amplitude model includes the two-body\ndecays $D^{0} \\rightarrow \\bar{K}^{*0}\\rho^{0}$, $D^{0} \\rightarrow\nK^{-}a_{1}^{+}(1260)$ and $D^{0} \\rightarrow K_{1}^{-}(1270)\\pi^{+}$, the\nthree-body decays $D^{0} \\rightarrow \\bar{K}^{*0}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ and $D^{0}\n\\rightarrow K^{-}\\pi^{+}\\rho^{0}$, as well as the four-body decay $D^{0}\n\\rightarrow K^{-}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$. The dominant intermediate process is\n$D^{0} \\rightarrow K^{-}a_{1}^{+}(1260)$, accounting for a fit fraction of\n$54.6\\%$.\n", "  We discuss a novel signature of dark matter production at the LHC resulting\nfrom the emission of an additional Higgs boson in the dark sector. The presence\nof such a dark Higgs boson is motivated simultaneously by the need to generate\nthe masses of the particles in the dark sector and the possibility to relax\nconstraints from the dark matter relic abundance by opening up a new\nannihilation channel. If the dark Higgs boson decays into Standard Model states\nvia a small mixing with the Standard Model Higgs boson, one obtains\ncharacteristic large-radius jets in association with missing transverse\nmomentum that can be used to efficiently discriminate signal from backgrounds.\nWe present the sensitivities achievable in LHC searches for dark Higgs bosons\nwith already collected data and demonstrate that such searches can probe large\nregions of parameter space that are inaccessible to conventional mono-jet or\ndi-jet searches.\n", "  A major challenge in solar and heliospheric physics is understanding how\nhighly localized regions, far smaller than 1 degree at the Sun, are the source\nof solar-wind structures spanning more than 20 degrees near Earth. The Sun's\natmosphere is divided into magnetically open regions, coronal holes, where\nsolar-wind plasma streams out freely and fills the solar system, and closed\nregions, where the plasma is confined to coronal loops. The boundary between\nthese regions extends outward as the heliospheric current sheet (HCS).\nMeasurements of plasma composition imply that the solar wind near the HCS, the\nso-called slow solar wind, originates in closed regions, presumably by the\nprocesses of field-line opening or interchange reconnection. Mysteriously,\nhowever, slow wind is also often seen far from the HCS. We use high-resolution,\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to calculate the dynamics of\na coronal hole whose geometry includes a narrow corridor flanked by closed\nfield and which is driven by supergranule-like flows at the coronal-hole\nboundary. We find that these dynamics result in the formation of giant arcs of\nclosed-field plasma that extend far from the HCS and span tens of degrees in\nlatitude and longitude at Earth, accounting for the slow solar wind\nobservations.\n", "  We demonstrate how dipolar interactions can have pronounced effects on the\nstructure of vortices in atomic spinor Bose-Einstein condensates and illustrate\ngeneric physical principles that apply across dipolar spinor systems. We then\nfind and analyze the cores of singular vortices with non-Abelian charges in the\npoint-group symmetry of a spin-3 $^{52}$Cr condensate. Using a simpler model\nsystem, we analyze the underlying dipolar physics and show how a characteristic\nlength scale arising from the magnetic dipolar coupling interacts with the\nhierarchy of healing lengths of the s-wave scattering, and leads to simple\ncriteria for the core structure: When the interactions both energetically favor\nthe ground-state spin condition, such as in the spin-1 ferromagnetic phase, the\nsize of singular vortices is restricted to the shorter spin-dependent healing\nlength. Conversely, when the interactions compete (e.g., in the spin-1 polar\nphase), we find that the core of a singular vortex is enlarged by increasing\ndipolar coupling. We further demonstrate how the spin-alignment arising from\nthe interaction anisotropy is manifest in the appearance of a ground-state\nspin-vortex line that is oriented perpendicularly to the condensate axis of\nrotation, as well as in potentially observable internal core spin textures. We\nalso explain how it leads to interaction-dependent angular momentum in\nnonsingular vortices as a result of competition with rotation-induced spin\nordering. When the anisotropy is modified by a strong magnetic field, we show\nhow it gives rise to a symmetry-breaking deformation of a vortex core into a\nspin-domain wall.\n", "  We calculate the leading order in $\\alpha_s$ QCD amplitude for exclusive\nneutrino and antineutrino production of a $D$ pseudoscalar charmed meson on an\nunpolarized nucleon. We work in the framework of the collinear QCD approach\nwhere generalized parton distributions (GPDs) factorize from perturbatively\ncalculable coefficient functions. We include both $O(m_c)$ terms in the\ncoefficient functions and $O(M_D)$ mass term contributions in the heavy meson\ndistribution amplitudes. We emphasize the sensitivity of specific observables\non the transversity quark GPDs.\n", "  We investigate, using the density matrix renormalization group, the evolution\nof the Nagaoka state with $t'$ hoppings that frustrate the hole kinetic energy\nin the $U=\\infty$ Hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice and the\nsquare lattice with second-nearest neighbor hoppings. We find that the Nagaoka\nferromagnet survives up to a rather small $t'_c/t \\sim 0.2.$ At this critical\nvalue, there is a transition to an antiferromagnetic phase, that depends on the\nlattice: a ${\\bf Q}=(Q,0)$ spiral order, that continuously evolves with $t'$,\nfor the triangular lattice, and the usual ${\\bf Q}=(\\pi,\\pi)$ N\\'eel order for\nthe square lattice. Remarkably, the local magnetization takes its classical\nvalue for all considered $t'$ ($t'/t \\le 1$). Our results show that the\nrecently found classical kinetic antiferromagnetism, a perfect counterpart of\nNagaoka ferromagnetism, is a generic phenomenon in these kinetically frustrated\nelectronic systems.\n", "  Ba2Ti2Fe2As4O is a self-doped superconductor exhibiting a Tc ~ 21.5 K and\ncontaining, distinctively with respect to other Fe-based superconductors, not\nonly [Fe2As2] layers but also conducting [Ti2O] sheets. This compound exhibits\na transition at T* ~ 125 K which has tentatively been assigned in the\nliterature to a possible density-wave order. However, the nature of this\ndensity wave (whether it is a charge- or spin-induced) is still under debate.\nMagnetism in Ba2Ti2Fe2As4O has never been experimentally confirmed, which\nraises the question whether this superconductor might be non-magnetic or\nexhibiting a very weak magnetism. Here, we report evidence from inelastic\nneutron scattering (INS) measurements and ab initio calculations of phonon\nspectra pointing towards absence of magnetism in Ba2Ti2Fe2As4O. The INS\nmeasurements did not reveal any noticeable change of the phonon spectra across\nTc, neither could magnetic effects be observed within the accessible (Q, E)\nspace, setting Ba2Ti2Fe2As4O as an unconventional superconductor. The effect of\nmagnetism on describing phonon spectra was further investigated by performing\nab initio calculations. In this context, non-magnetic calculations reproduced\nwell the measured phonon spectra. Therefore, our results indicate a\nnon-magnetic and unconventional character of the superconductor Ba2Ti2Fe2As4O.\n", "  We compute the Wald entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole in the\nghost-free, infinite derivative gravity that is quadratic in curvature. This is\nnot given purely by the area law but includes an additional contribution\ndepending on the power of d'Alembertian operator, when requiring that the\nmassless graviton be the only propagating mode in the Minkowski sapcetime.\n", "  We investigate an exact nonequilibrium solution of a two-site electron-phonon\nmodel, where an infrared-active phonon that is nonlinearly coupled to the\nelectrons is driven by a laser field. The time-resolved electronic spectrum\nshows coherence-incoherence spectral weight transfer, a clear signature of\nlight-enhanced electron-phonon coupling. The present study is motivated by\nrecent evidence for enhanced electron-phonon coupling in pump-probe TeraHertz\nand angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in bilayer graphene when driven\nnear resonance with an infrared-active phonon mode [E.~Pomarico et al.,\nPhys.~Rev.~B 95, 024304 (2017)], and by a theoretical study suggesting that\ntransient electronic attraction arises from nonlinear electron-phonon coupling\n[D.~M.~Kennes et al., Nature Physics (2017), 10.1038/nphys4024]. We show that a\nlinear scaling of light-enhanced electron-phonon coupling with the pump field\nintensity emerges, in accordance with a time-nonlocal self-energy based on a\nmean-field decoupling using quasi-classical phonon coherent states. Finally we\ndemonstrate that this leads to enhanced double occupancies in accordance with\nan effective electron-electron attraction. Our results suggest that materials\nwith strong phonon nonlinearities provide an ideal playground to achieve\nlight-enhanced electron-phonon coupling and possibly light-induced\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  Gravitational-wave memory manifests as a permanent distortion of an idealized\ngravitational-wave detector and arises generically from energetic astrophysical\nevents. For example, binary black hole mergers are expected to emit memory\nbursts a little more than an order of magnitude smaller in strain than the\noscillatory parent waves. We introduce the concept of \"orphan memory\":\ngravitational-wave memory for which there is no detectable parent signal. In\nparticular, high-frequency gravitational-wave bursts ($\\gtrsim$ kHz) produce\norphan memory in the LIGO/Virgo band. We show that Advanced LIGO measurements\ncan place stringent limits on the existence of high-frequency gravitational\nwaves, effectively increasing the LIGO bandwidth by orders of magnitude. We\ninvestigate the prospects for and implications of future searches for orphan\nmemory.\n", "  Intermediate mass black holes play a critical role in understanding the\nevolutionary connection between stellar mass and super-massive black holes.\nHowever, to date the existence of these species of black holes remains\nambiguous and their formation process is therefore unknown. It has been long\nsuspected that black holes with masses $10^{2}-10^{4}M_{\\odot}$ should form and\nreside in dense stellar systems. Therefore, dedicated observational campaigns\nhave targeted globular cluster for many decades searching for signatures of\nthese elusive objects. All candidates found in these targeted searches appear\nradio dim and do not have the X-ray to radio flux ratio predicted by the\nfundamental plane for accreting black holes. Based on the lack of an\nelectromagnetic counterpart upper limits of $2060 M_{\\odot}$ and $470\nM_{\\odot}$ have been placed on the mass of a putative black hole in 47 Tucanae\n(NGC 104) from radio and X-ray observations respectively. Here we show there is\nevidence for a central black hole in 47 Tuc with a mass of M$_{\\bullet}\\sim2300\nM_{\\odot}$$_{-850}^{+1500}$ when the dynamical state of the globular cluster is\nprobed with pulsars. The existence of an intermediate mass black hole in the\ncentre of one of the densest clusters with no detectable electromagnetic\ncounterpart suggests that the black hole is not accreting at a sufficient rate\nand therefore contrary to expectations is gas starved. This intermediate mass\nblack hole might be a member of electromagnetically invisible population of\nblack holes that are the elusive seeds leading to the formation of supermassive\nblack holes in galaxies.\n", "  Quantum nondemolition theory has been well understood for a number of\ndecades, however, applications of such techniques remain limited owing to the\nincreased complexity that these techniques require. In this paper, quantum\nnondemolition theory is used to investigate the performance of a real world\ndevice, an electro-optic feed-forward intensity noise eater. It is shown that\nby replacing the typical beamsplitter in such a device with a single pass\nsecond harmonic generation followed by a dichroic mirror the performance of the\nnoise eater can be significantly improved, even with low conversion\nefficiencies.\n", "  Electroluminescence from individual carbon nanotubes within split-gate\ndevices is investigated. By characterizing the air-suspended nanotubes with\nphotoluminescence spectroscopy, chirality is identified and electroluminescence\npeaks are assigned. We observe electroluminescence linewidth comparable to\nphotoluminescence, indicating negligible heating and state-mixing effects.\nSplit-gate and bias voltage dependences are consistent with emission from an\nelectrostatically formed $pn$-junction.\n", "  The radial metallicity distribution in the Galactic thin disc represents a\ncrucial constraint for modelling disc formation and evolution. Open clusters\nallow us to derive both the radial metallicity distribution and its evolution\nover time. In this paper we perform the first investigation of the present-day\nradial metallicity distribution based on [Fe/H] determinations in late type\nmembers of pre-main-sequence clusters. Because of their youth, these clusters\nare therefore essential for tracing the current inter-stellar medium\nmetallicity. We used the products of the Gaia-ESO Survey analysis of 12 young\nregions (age<100 Myr), covering Galactocentric distances from 6.67 to 8.70 kpc.\nFor the first time, we derived the metal content of star forming regions\nfarther than 500 pc from the Sun. Median metallicities were determined through\nsamples of reliable cluster members. For ten clusters the membership analysis\nis discussed in the present paper, while for other two clusters (Chamaeleon I\nand Gamma Velorum) we adopted the members identified in our previous works. All\nthe pre-main-sequence clusters considered in this paper have close-to-solar or\nslightly sub-solar metallicities. The radial metallicity distribution traced by\nthese clusters is almost flat, with the innermost star forming regions having\n[Fe/H] values that are 0.10-0.15 dex lower than the majority of the older\nclusters located at similar Galactocentric radii. This homogeneous study of the\npresent-day radial metallicity distribution in the Galactic thin disc favours\nmodels that predict a flattening of the radial gradient over time. On the other\nhand, the decrease of the average [Fe/H] at young ages is not easily explained\nby the models. Our results reveal a complex interplay of several processes\n(e.g. star formation activity, initial mass function, supernova yields, gas\nflows) that controlled the recent evolution of the Milky Way.\n", "  This article provides a summary of XMM-Newton highlights on stellar tidal\ndisruption events. First found with ROSAT, ongoing and upcoming sky surveys\nwill detect these events in the 1000s. In X- rays, tidal disruption events\n(TDEs) provide us with powerful new probes of accretion physics under extreme\nconditions and on short timescales and of relativistic effects near the SMBH,\nof the formation and evolution of disk winds near or above the Eddington limit,\nand of the processes of high-energy emission from newly launched radio jets.\nTDEs serve as signposts of the presence of dormant, single black holes at the\ncores of galaxies, and of binary black holes as well, since TDE lightcurves are\ncharacteristically different in the latter case. XMM-Newton has started to\ncontribute to all of these topics, and a rich discovery space is opening up in\nthe next decade.\n", "  We explore the dynamics of spontaneous breakdown of mirror symmetry in a pair\nof identical optomechanical cavities symmetrically coupled to a waveguide.\nLarge optical intensities enable optomechanically-induced nonlinear detuning of\nthe optical resonators, resulting in a pitchfork bifurcation. We investigate\nthe stability of this regime and explore the possibility of inducing\nmultistability. By injecting proper trigger pulses, the proposed structure can\ntoggle between two asymmetric stable states, thus serving as a low-noise\nnanophotonic all-optical switch or memory element.\n", "  Layered transition metal dichalcogenides MoTe$_2$ and WTe$_2$ share almost\nsimilar lattice constants as well as topological electronic properties except\ntheir structural phase transitions. While the former shows a first-order phase\ntransition between monoclinic and orthorhombic structures, the latter does not.\nUsing a recently proposed van der Waals density functional method, we\ninvestigate structural stability of the two materials and uncover that the\ndisparate phase transitions originate from delicate differences between their\ninterlayer bonding states near the Fermi energy. By exploiting the relation\nbetween the structural phase transitions and the low energy electronic\nproperties, we show that a charge doping can control the transition\nsubstantially, thereby suggesting a way to stabilize or to eliminate their\ntopological electronic energy bands.\n", "  Density-functional theory forces, stresses and energies comprise a database\nfrom which the optimal parameters of a spline-based empirical potential\ncombining Stillinger-Weber and modified embedded-atom forms are determined.\nAccuracy of the potential is demonstrated by predictions of ideal shear,\nstacking fault, vacancy migration, elastic constants and phonons all between 0\nand 100 GPa. Consistency with existing models and experiments is demonstrated\nby application to screw dislocation core structure and deformation twinning in\na tungsten nanorod. Lastly, the potential is used to study the high-pressure\nbcc to fcc phase transition.\n", "  The VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey has observed hundreds of O-type stars in the\n30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We study the properties\nof 105 apparently single O-type dwarfs. To determine stellar and wind\nparameters, we used the IACOB-GBAT package, an automatic procedure based on a\nlarge grid of atmospheric models calculated with the FASTWIND code. In addition\nto classical techniques, we applied the Bayesian BONNSAI tool to estimate\nevolutionary masses. We provide a new calibration of effective temperature vs.\nspectral type for O-type dwarfs in the LMC, based on our homogeneous analysis\nof the largest sample of such objects to date and including all spectral\nsubtypes. Good agreement with previous results is found, although the sampling\nat the earliest subtypes could be improved. Rotation rates and helium\nabundances are studied in an evolutionary context. We find that most of the\nrapid rotators (vsini higher than 300 km/s ) in our sample have masses below 25\nMSun and intermediate rotation-corrected gravities (log gc between 3.9 and\n4.1). Such rapid rotators are scarce at higher gravities (i.e. younger ages)\nand absent at lower gravities (larger ages). This is not expected from\ntheoretical evolutionary models, and does not appear to be due to a selection\nbias in our sample. We compare the estimated evolutionary and spectroscopic\nmasses, finding a trend that the former is higher for masses below 20 MSun.\nThis can be explained as a consequence of limiting our sample to the O-type\nstars, and we see no compelling evidence for a systematic mass discrepancy. For\nmost of the stars in the sample we were unable to estimate the wind-strength\nparameter (hence mass-loss rates) reliably, particularly for objects with\nluminosity lower than logL/LSun about 5.1. Ultraviolet spectroscopy is needed\nto undertake a detailed investigation of the wind properties of these dwarfs.\n", "  We consider a semi-infinite dielectric with multiple spatially dispersive\nresonances in the susceptibility. The effect of the boundary is described by an\narbitrary reflection coefficient for polarization waves in the material at the\nsurface, with specific values corresponding to various additional boundary\nconditions (ABCs) for Maxwell's equations. We derive exact expressions for the\nelectromagnetic reflection and transmission coefficients and present the\nresults for a variety of materials with multiple exciton bands. We find an\nimproved single-band approximation for heavy/light exciton bands and extend our\nmodel to exciton dispersion relations with linear $k$ terms which occur in\nuniaxial crystals. Finally, we calculate the spectral energy density of thermal\nand zero-point radiation for a variety of multi-resonance models and ABCs.\n", "  The field equations for Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity in $D$ dimensions\nare reduced to an effective one-dimensional system under the influence of\nexponential potentials. Various cases where exact solutions can be found are\nexplored. With this procedure, we present interesting solutions such as a\none-parameter generalisation of the dilaton-Melvin spacetime and a\nthree-parameter solution that interpolates between the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m\nand Bertotti-Robinson solution. This procedure also allows simple, alternative\nderivations of known solutions such as the Lifshitz spacetime and the planar\nAnti-de Sitter naked singularity. In the latter case, the metric is cast in a\nsimpler form which reveals the presence of an additional curvature singularity.\n", "  A Kochen-Specker (KS) set is a specific set of projectors and measurement\ncontexts that prove the Bell-Kochen-Specker contextuality theorem. The simplest\nknown KS sets in Hilbert space dimensions $d=3,4,5,6,8$ are reproduced, and\nseveral methods by which a new KS set can be constructed using one or more\nknown KS sets in lower dimensions are reviewed and improved. These KS sets and\nimproved methods enable the construction of explicitly critical new KS sets in\nall dimensions, where critical refers to the irreducibility of the set of\ncontexts. The simplest known critical KS sets are derived in all even\ndimensions $d\\geq10$ with at most 9 contexts and 30 projectors, and in all odd\ndimensions $d\\geq 7$ with at most 13 contexts and 39 projectors. These results\nshow that neither the number of contexts nor the number of projectors in a\nminimal KS set scales with dimension $d$.\n", "  We study the charmless two-body decays of $b$-baryons $(\\Lambda_b$,\n$\\Xi_b^-$, $\\Xi_b^0)$. We find that ${\\cal B}(\\Xi_b^-\\to \\Lambda\n\\rho^-)=(2.08^{+0.69}_{-0.51})\\times 10^{-6}$ and ${\\cal B}(\\Xi_b^0\\to \\Sigma^+\nM^-)=(4.45^{+1.46}_{-1.09},11.49^{+3.8}_{-2.9},4.69^{+1.11}_{-0.79},2.98^{+0.76}_{-0.51})\\times\n10^{-6}$ for $M^-=(\\pi^-,\\rho^-,K^-,K^{*-})$, which are compatible to ${\\cal\nB}(\\Lambda_b\\to p \\pi^-,p K^-)$. We also obtain that ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b\\to\n\\Lambda\\omega)=(2.30\\pm0.10)\\times 10^{-6}$, ${\\cal B}(\\Xi_b^-\\to\\Xi^-\n\\phi,\\Xi^- \\omega)\\simeq {\\cal B}(\\Xi_b^0\\to\\Xi^0 \\phi,\\Xi^0\n\\omega)=(5.35\\pm0.41,3.65\\pm0.16)\\times 10^{-6}$ and ${\\cal\nB}(\\Xi^-_b\\to\\Xi^{-} \\eta^{(\\prime)})\\simeq {\\cal B}(\\Xi^0_b\\to \\Xi^0\n\\eta^{(\\prime)})=(2.51^{+0.70}_{-0.46},2.99^{+1.16}_{-0.57})\\times 10^{-6}$.\nFor the CP violating asymmetries, we show that ${\\cal A}_{CP}(\\Lambda_b\\to p\nK^{*-})={\\cal A}_{CP}(\\Xi_b^-\\to \\Sigma^0(\\Lambda)K^{*-})={\\cal\nA}_{CP}(\\Xi_b^0\\to \\Sigma^+K^{*-})=(19.7\\pm 1.4)\\%$. Similar to the charmless\ntwo-body $\\Lambda_b$ decays, the $\\Xi_b$ decays are accessible to the LHCb\ndetector.\n", "  We analyze the equilibrium spatial distribution of surface temperatures of\npatterned surfaces. The surface is exposed to a constant external heat flux and\nhas a fixed internal temperature that is coupled to the outside heat fluxes by\nfinite heat conductivity across surface. It is assumed that the temperatures\nare sufficiently high so that the thermal wavelength (a few microns at room\ntemperature) is short compared to all geometric length scales of the surface\npatterns. Hence the radiosity method can be employed. A recursive multiple\nscattering method is developed that enables rapid convergence to equilibrium\ntemperatures. While the temperature distributions show distinct dependence on\nthe detailed surface shapes (cuboids and cylinder are studied), we demonstrate\nrobust universal relations between the mean and the standard deviation of the\ntemperature distributions and quantities that characterize overall geometric\nfeatures of the surface shape.\n", "  Using shape measurement techniques developed for weak lensing surveys we have\nidentified three new ultracool binaries in the Pan-STARRS1 survey. Binary\ncompanions which are not completely resolved can still alter the shapes of\nstellar images. These shape distortions can be measured if PSF anisotropy\ncaused by the telescope is properly accounted for. We show using both a sample\nof known binary stars and simulated binaries that we can reliably recover\nbinaries wider than around 0.3\" and with flux ratios greater than around 0.1.\nWe then applied our method to a sample of ultracool dwarfs within 30pc with 293\nobjects having sufficient Pan-STARRS1 data for our method. In total we\nrecovered all but one of the 11 binaries wider than 0.3\" in this sample. Our\none failure was a true binary detected with a significant but erroneously high\nellipticity which led it to be rejected in our analysis. We identify three new\nbinaries, one a simultaneous discovery, with primary spectral types M6.5, L1\nand T0.5. These latter two were confirmed with Keck/NIRC2 follow-up imaging.\nThis technique will be useful for identifying large numbers of stellar and\nsubstellar binaries in the upcoming LSST and DES sky surveys.\n", "  Measurements of radial velocity variations from the spectroscopic monitoring\nof stars and their companions are essential for a broad swath of astrophysics,\nproviding access to the fundamental physical properties that dictate all phases\nof stellar evolution and facilitating the quantitative study of planetary\nsystems. The conversion of those measurements into both constraints on the\norbital architecture and individual component spectra can be a serious\nchallenge, however, especially for extreme flux ratio systems and observations\nwith relatively low sensitivity. Gaussian processes define sampling\ndistributions of flexible, continuous functions that are well-motivated for\nmodeling stellar spectra, enabling proficient search for companion lines in\ntime-series spectra. We introduce a new technique for spectral disentangling,\nwhere the posterior distributions of the orbital parameters and intrinsic,\nrest-frame stellar spectra are explored simultaneously without needing to\ninvoke cross-correlation templates. To demonstrate its potential, this\ntechnique is deployed on red-optical time-series spectra of the mid-M dwarf\nbinary LP661-13. We report orbital parameters with improved precision compared\nto traditional radial velocity analysis and successfully reconstruct the\nprimary and secondary spectra. We discuss potential applications for other\nstellar and exoplanet radial velocity techniques and extensions to\ntime-variable spectra. The code used in this analysis is freely available as an\nopen source Python package.\n", "  In experiment and theory, we resolve the mechanism of ultrafast optical\nmagnon excitation in antiferromagnetic NiO. We employ time-resolved optical\ntwo-color pump-probe measurements to study the coherent non-thermal spin\ndynamics. Optical pumping and probing with linearly and circularly polarized\nlight along the optic axis of the NiO crystal scrutinizes the mechanism behind\nthe ultrafast optical magnon excitation. A phenomenological symmetry-based\ntheory links these experimental results to expressions for the optically\ninduced magnetization via the inverse Faraday effect and the inverse\nCotton-Mouton effect. We obtain striking agreement between experiment and\ntheory that, furthermore, allows us to extract information about the spin\ndomain distribution. We also find that in NiO the energy transfer into the\nmagnon mode via the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect is about three orders of\nmagnitude more efficient than via the inverse Faraday effect.\n", "  The statistical properties of the soft gamma repeater SGR J1550--5418 are\ninvestigated carefully. We find that the cumulative distributions of fluence,\npeak flux and duration can be well fitted by a bent power law, while the\ncumulative distribution of waiting time follows a simple power law. In\nparticular, the probability density functions of fluctuations of fluence, peak\nflux, and duration have a sharp peak and fat tails, which can be well fitted by\na $q$-Gaussian function. The $q$ values keep approximately steady for different\nscale intervals, indicating a scale-invariant structure of soft gamma\nrepeaters. Those results support that the origin of soft gamma repeaters is\ncrustquakes of neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields.\n", "  Every observation of astrophysical objects involving a spectrum requires\natomic data for the interpretation of line fluxes, line ratios and ionization\nstate of the emitting plasma. One of the processes which determines it is\ncollisional ionization. In this study an update of the direct ionization (DI)\nand excitation-autoionization (EA) processes is discussed for the H to Zn-like\nisoelectronic sequences. In the last years new laboratory measurements and\ntheoretical calculations of ionization cross sections have become available. We\nprovide an extension and update of previous published reviews in the\nliterature. We include the most recent experimental measurements and fit the\ncross sections of all individual shells of all ions from H to Zn. These data\nare described using an extension of Younger's and Mewe's formula, suitable for\nintegration over a Maxwellian velocity distribution to derive the subshell\nionization rate coefficients. These ionization rate coefficients are\nincorporated in the high-resolution plasma code and spectral fitting tool SPEX\nV3.0.\n", "  We explore the correlations between velocity and metallicity and the possible\ndistinct chemical signatures of the velocity over-densities of the local\nGalactic neighbourhood. We use the large spectroscopic survey RAVE and the\nGeneva Copenhagen Survey. We compare the metallicity distribution of regions in\nthe velocity plane ($v_R,v_\\phi$) with that of their symmetric counterparts\n($-v_R,v_\\phi$). We expect similar metallicity distributions if there are no\ntracers of a sub-population (e.g., a dispersed cluster, accreted stars), if the\ndisk of the Galaxy is axisymmetric, and if the orbital effects of the spiral\narms and the bar are weak. We find that the metallicity-velocity space of the\nsolar neighbourhood is highly patterned. A large fraction of the velocity plane\nshows differences in the metallicity distribution when comparing symmetric\n$v_R$ regions. The typical differences in the median metallicity are of $0.05$\ndex with a statistical significance of at least $95\\%$, and with values up to\n$0.6$ dex. For low azimuthal velocity $v_\\phi$, stars moving outwards in the\nGalaxy have on average higher metallicity than those moving inwards. These\ninclude stars in the Hercules and Hyades moving groups and other velocity\nbranch-like structures. For higher $v_\\phi$, the stars moving inwards have\nhigher metallicity than those moving outwards. The most likely interpretation\nof the metallicity asymmetry is that it is due to the orbital effects of the\nbar and the radial metallicity gradient of the disk. We present a simulation\nthat supports this idea. We have also discovered a positive gradient in\n$v_\\phi$ with respect to metallicity at high metallicities, apart from the two\nknown positive and negative gradients for the thick and thin disks,\nrespectively.\n", "  The bilayered member of the Ruddesden-Popper family of ruthenates,\nSr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, has received an increasing attention due to its interesting\nproperties and phases. By using first principle calculations we find that the\nground-state is characterized by a ferromagnetic (FM) half-metallic state. This\nstate strongly competes with an antiferromagnetic metallic phase, which\nindicates the possible presence of a particular state characterized by the\nexistence of different magnetic domains. To drive the system towards a phase\ntransition we studied the electronic and magnetic properties as a function of\nRuO$_6$ octahedra rotations and found that the magnetic phase does not couple\nwith the rotation angle. Our results provide accurate electronic, structure,\nand magnetic ground-state properties of Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and stimulate the\ninvestigation of other type of octahedra rotations and distortions in the\nsearch of phase transitions.\n", "  With the discovery of rocky planets in the temperate habitable zone (HZ) of\nthe close-by cool star TRAPPIST-1 the question of whether such planets could\nharbour life arises. Habitable planets around red dwarf stars can orbit in\nradiation environments that can be life-sterilizing. UV flares from these stars\nare more frequent and intense than solar flares. Additionally, their temperate\nHZs are closer to the star. Here we present UV surface environment models for\nTRAPPIST-1's HZ planets and explore the implications for life. TRAPPIST-1 has\nhigh X-ray/EUV activity, placing planetary atmospheres at risk from erosion. If\na dense Earth-like atmosphere with a protective ozone layer exists on planets\nin the HZ of TRAPPIST-1, UV surface environments would be similar to\npresent-day Earth. However an eroded or an anoxic atmosphere, would allow more\nUV to reach the surface, making surface environments hostile even to highly\nUV-tolerant terrestrial extremophiles. If future observations detect ozone in\nthe atmospheres of any of the planets in the HZ of TRAPPIST-1, these would be\ninteresting targets for the search for surface life. We anticipate our assay to\nbe a starting point for in-depth exploration of stellar and atmospheric\nobservations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets to constrain their\nUV-surface-habitability.\n", "  We compute the star formation rate (SFR) in molecular clouds (MCs) that\noriginate {\\it ab initio} in a new, higher-resolution simulation of\nsupernova-driven turbulence. Because of the large number of well-resolved\nclouds with self-consistent boundary and initial conditions, we obtain a large\nrange of cloud physical parameters with realistic statistical distributions, an\nunprecedented sample of star-forming regions to test SFR models and to\ninterpret observational surveys. We confirm the dependence of the SFR per\nfree-fall time, $SFR_{\\rm ff}$, on the virial parameter, $\\alpha_{\\rm vir}$,\nfound in previous simulations, and compare a revised version of our turbulent\nfragmentation model with the numerical results. The dependences on Mach number,\n${\\cal M}$, gas to magnetic pressure ratio, $\\beta$, and compressive to\nsolenoidal power ratio, $\\chi$ at fixed $\\alpha_{\\rm vir}$ are not well\nconstrained, because of random scatter due to time and cloud-to-cloud\nvariations in $SFR_{\\rm ff}$. We find that $SFR_{\\rm ff}$ in MCs can take any\nvalue in the range $0 \\le SFR_{\\rm ff} \\lesssim 0.2$, and its probability\ndistribution peaks at a value $SFR_{\\rm ff}\\approx 0.025$, consistent with\nobservations. The values of $SFR_{\\rm ff}$ and the scatter in the $SFR_{\\rm\nff}$--$\\alpha_{\\rm vir}$ relation are consistent with recent measurements in\nnearby MCs and in clouds near the Galactic center. Although not explicitly\nmodeled by the theory, the scatter is consistent with the physical assumptions\nof our revised model and may also result in part from a lack of statistical\nequilibrium of the turbulence, due to the transient nature of MCs.\n", "  We test the performance of our analysis technique for integrated-light\nspectra by applying it to seven well-studied Galactic GCs that span a wide\nrange of metallicities. Integrated-light spectra were obtained by scanning the\nslit of the UVES spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope across the\nhalf-light diameters of the clusters. We modelled the spectra using resolved\nHST colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), as well as theoretical isochrones, in\ncombination with standard stellar atmosphere and spectral synthesis codes. The\nabundances of Fe, Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ba were compared with literature data\nfor individual stars in the clusters. The typical differences between iron\nabundances derived from our integrated-light spectra and those compiled from\nthe literature are less than 0.1 dex. A larger difference is found for one\ncluster (NGC 6752), and is most likely caused primarily by stochastic\nfluctuations in the numbers of bright red giants within the scanned area. As\nexpected, the alpha-elements (Ca, Ti) are enhanced by about 0.3 dex compared to\nthe Solar-scaled composition, while the [Cr/Fe] ratios are close to Solar. When\nusing up-to-date line lists, our [Mg/Fe] ratios also agree well with literature\ndata. Our [Na/Fe] ratios are, on average, 0.08-0.14 dex lower than average\nvalues quoted in the literature, and our [Ba/Fe] ratios may be overestimated by\n0.20-0.35 dex at the lowest metallicities. We find that analyses based on\ntheoretical isochrones give very similar results to those based on resolved\nCMDs. Overall, the agreement between our integrated-light abundance\nmeasurements and the literature data is satisfactory. Refinements of the\nmodelling procedure, such as corrections for stellar evolutionary and non-LTE\neffects, might further reduce some of the remaining offsets.\n", "  Polarization is an important tool to further the understanding of\ninterstellar dust and the sources behind it. In this paper we describe our\nimplementation of polarization that is due to scattering of light by spherical\ngrains and electrons in the dust Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SKIRT. In\ncontrast to the implementations of other Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes,\nours uses co-moving reference frames that rely solely on the scattering\nprocesses. It fully supports the peel-off mechanism that is crucial for the\nefficient calculation of images in 3D Monte Carlo codes. We develop\nreproducible test cases that push the limits of our code. The results of our\nprogram are validated by comparison with analytically calculated solutions.\nAdditionally, we compare results of our code to previously published results.\nWe apply our method to models of dusty spiral galaxies at near-infrared and\noptical wavelengths. We calculate polarization degree maps and show them to\ncontain signatures that trace characteristics of the dust arms independent of\nthe inclination or rotation of the galaxy.\n", "  Filaments are key for star formation models. As part of the study carried out\nby the Herschel GCC Programme, here we study the filament properties presented\nin GCC.VII in context with theoretical models of filament formation and\nevolution. A conservative sample of filaments at a distance D<500pc was\nextracted with the Getfilaments algorithm. Their physical structure was\nquantified according to two main components: the central (Gaussian) region\n(core component), and the power-law like region dominating the filament column\ndensity profile at larger radii (wing component). The properties and behaviour\nof these components relative to the total linear mass density of the filament\nand its environmental column density were compared with theoretical models\ndescribing the evolution of filaments under gravity-dominated conditions. The\nfeasibility of a transition to supercritical state by accretion is dependent on\nthe combined effect of filament intrinsic properties and environmental\nconditions. Reasonably self-gravitating (high Mline-core) filaments in dense\nenvironments (av\\sim3mag) can become supercritical in timescales of t\\sim1Myr\nby accreting mass at constant or decreasing width. The trend of increasing\nMline-tot (Mline-core and Mline-wing), and ridge Av with background also\nindicates that the precursors of star-forming filaments evolve coevally with\ntheir environment. The simultaneous increase of environment and filament Av\nexplains the association between dense environments and high Mline-core values,\nand argues against filaments remaining in constant single-pressure equilibrium\nstates. The simultaneous growth of filament and background in locations with\nefficient mass assembly, predicted in numerical models of collapsing clouds,\npresents a suitable scenario for the fulfillment of the combined filament\nmass-environment criterium that is in quantitative agreement with Herschel\nobservations.\n", "  The measured values of the Higgs and top quark mass indicate that the\nelectroweak vacuum is metastable if there is no new physics below the Planck\nscale. This is at odds with a period of high scale inflation. A non-minimal\ncoupling between the Higgs field and the Ricci scalar can stabilize the vacuum\nas it generates a large effective Higgs mass during inflation. We consider the\neffect of this coupling during preheating, when Higgs modes can be produced\nvery efficiently due to the oscillating Ricci scalar. We compute their effect\non the effective potential and the energy density. The Higgs excitations are\ndefined with respect to the adiabatic vacuum. We study the adiabaticity\nconditions and find that the dependence of our results on the choice of the\norder of the adiabatic vacuum increases with time. For large enough coupling\nparticle production is so efficient that the Higgs decays to the true vacuum\nbefore this is an issue. However, for smaller values of the Higgs-curvature\ncoupling no definite statements can be made as the vacuum dependence is large.\n", "  The overtaking collisions of ion-acoustic solitons (IASs) in presence of\ntrapping effects of electrons are studied based on a fully kinetic simulation\napproach. The method is able to provide all the kinetic details of the process\nalongside the fluid-level quantities self consistently. Solitons are produced\nnaturally by utilizing the chain formation phenomenon, then are arranged in a\nnew simulation box to test different scenarios of overtaking collisions. Three\nachievements are reported here. Firstly, simulations prove the long-time life\nspan of the ion-acoustic solitons in the presence of trapping effect of\nelectrons (kinetic effects), which serves as the benchmark of the simulation\ncode. Secondly, their stability against overtaking mutual collisions is\nestablished by creating collisions between solitons with different number and\nshapes of trapped electrons, i.e. different trapping parameter. Finally,\ndetails of solitons during collisions for both ions and electrons are provided\non both fluid and kinetic levels. These results show that on the kinetic level,\ntrapped electron population accompanying each of the solitons are exchanged\nbetween the solitons during the collision. Furthermore, the behavior of\nelectron holes accompanying solitons contradicts the theory about the electron\nholes interaction developed based on kinetic theory. They also show behaviors\nmuch different from other electron holes witnessed in processes such as\nnonlinear Landau damping (Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal -BGK- modes) or beam-plasma\ninteraction (like two-beam instability).\n", "  We describe a Herschel Space Observatory 194-671 micron spectroscopic survey\nof a sample of 121 local luminous infrared galaxies and report the fluxes of\nthe CO $J$ to $J$-1 rotational transitions for $4 \\leqslant J \\leqslant 13$,\nthe [NII] 205 um line, the [CI] lines at 609 and 370 um, as well as additional\nand usually fainter lines. The CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs)\npresented here are consistent with our earlier work, which was based on a\nsmaller sample, that calls for two distinct molecular gas components in\ngeneral: (i) a cold component, which emits CO lines primarily at $J \\lesssim 4$\nand likely represents the same gas phase traced by CO (1-0), and (ii) a warm\ncomponent, which dominates over the mid-$J$ regime ($4 < J < 10$) and is\nintimately related to current star formation. We present evidence that the CO\nline emission associated with an active galactic nucleus is significant only at\n$J > 10$. The flux ratios of the two [CI] lines imply modest excitation\ntemperatures of 15 to 30 K; the [CI] 370 um line scales more linearly in flux\nwith CO (4-3) than with CO (7-6). These findings suggest that the [CI] emission\nis predominately associated with the gas component defined in (i) above. Our\nanalysis of the stacked spectra in different far-infrared (FIR) color bins\nreveals an evolution of the SLED of the rotational transitions of water vapor\nas a function of the FIR color in a direction consistent with infrared photon\npumping.\n", "  Using the Illustris simulation, we follow thousands of elliptical galaxies\nback in time to identify how the dichotomy between fast and slow rotating\nellipticals (FRs and SRs) develops. Comparing to the\n$\\textrm{ATLAS}^\\textrm{3D}$ survey, we show that Illustris reproduces similar\nelliptical galaxy rotation properties, quantified by the degree of ordered\nrotation, $\\lambda_\\textrm{R}$. There is a clear segregation between low-mass\n($M_{\\rm *} < 10^{11} M_{\\rm \\odot}$) ellipticals, which form a smooth\ndistribution of FRs, and high-mass galaxies ($M_{\\rm *} > 10^{11.5} M_{\\rm\n  \\odot}$), which are mostly SRs, in agreement with observations. We find that\nSRs are very gas poor, metal rich and red in colour, while FRs are generally\nmore gas rich and still star forming. We suggest that ellipticals begin\nnaturally as FRs and, as they grow in mass, lose their spin and become SRs.\nWhile at $z = 1$, the progenitors of SRs and FRs are nearly indistinguishable,\ntheir merger and star formation histories differ thereafter. We find that major\nmergers tend to disrupt galaxy spin, though in rare cases can lead to a\nspin-up. No major difference is found between the effects of gas-rich and\ngas-poor mergers and the amount of minor mergers seem to have little\ncorrelation with galaxy spin. In between major mergers, lower-mass ellipticals,\nwhich are mostly gas-rich, tend to recover their spin by accreting gas and\nstars. For galaxies with $M_{\\rm *}$ above $\\sim 10^{11} M_{\\rm \\odot}$, this\ntrend reverses; galaxies only retain or steadily lose their spin. More frequent\nmergers, accompanied by an inability to regain spin, lead massive ellipticals\nto lose most of ordered rotation and transition from FRs to SRs.\n", "  The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) near-IR channel\nis extensively used in time-resolved observations, especially for transiting\nexoplanet spectroscopy and brown dwarf and directly imaged exoplanet rotational\nphase mapping. The ramp effect is the dominant source of systematics in the\nWFC3 for time-resolved observations, which limits its photometric precision.\nCurrent mitigation strategies are based on empirical fits and require\nadditional orbits \"to help the telescope reach a thermal equilibrium\". We show\nthat the ramp effect profiles can be explained and corrected with high fidelity\nusing charge trapping theories. We also present a model for this process that\ncan be used to predict and to correct charge trap systematics. Our model is\nbased on a very small number of parameters that are intrinsic to the detector.\nWe find that these parameters are very stable between the different datasets,\nand we provide best-fit values. Our model is tested with more than 120 orbits\n($\\sim40$ visits) of WFC3 observations and is proved to be able to provide near\nphoton noise limited corrections for observations made with both staring and\nscanning modes of transiting exoplanets as well as for starting-mode\nobservations of brown dwarfs. After our model correction, the light curve of\nthe first orbit in each visit has the same photometric precision as subsequent\norbits, so data from the first orbit need no longer be discarded. Near IR\narrays with the same physical characteristics (e.g., JWST/NIRCam) may also\nbenefit from the extension of this model, if similar systematic profiles are\nobserved.\n", "  Diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) hold a lot of information about the state\nand the structure of the ISM. Structure can most directly be observed by\nextensive spectroscopic surveys, including surveys of stars where DIBs are\nespecially important, as they are conveniently found in all observed bands.\nLarge surveys lack the quality of spectra to detect weak DIBs, so many spectra\nfrom small regions on the sky have to be combined before a sufficient\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is achieved. However, the clumpiness of the DIB\nclouds is unknown, which poses a problem, as the measured properties can end up\nbeing averaged over a too large area. We use a technique called Gaussian\nprocesses to accurately measure profiles of interstellar absorption lines in\n145 high SNR and high resolution spectra of hot stars. Together with Bayesian\nMCMC approach we also get reliable estimates of the uncertainties. We derive\nscales at which column densities of 18 DIBs, CH, CH$^+$, Ca I, and Ca II show\nsome spatial correlation. This correlation scale is associated with the size of\nthe ISM clouds. Scales expressed as the angle on the sky vary significantly\nfrom DIB to DIB between $\\sim0.23^\\circ$ for the DIB at 5512 {\\AA} and\n3.5$^\\circ$ for the DIB at 6196 {\\AA}, suggesting that different DIB carriers\nhave different clumpiness but occupy the same general space. Our study includes\nlines-of-sight all over the northern Milky Way, as well as out of the Galactic\nplane, covering regions with different physical conditions. The derived\ncorrelation scales therefore represent a general image of the Galactic ISM on\nthe scales of $\\sim5$ pc to $100$ pc.\n", "  We present SCUBA-2 follow-up of 61 candidate high-redshift Planck sources. Of\nthese, 10 are confirmed strong gravitational lenses and comprise some of the\nbrightest such submm sources on the observed sky, while 51 are candidate\nproto-cluster fields undergoing massive starburst events. With the accompanying\nHerschel-SPIRE observations and assuming an empirical dust temperature prior of\n$34^{+13}_{-9}$ K, we provide photometric redshift and far-IR luminosity\nestimates for 172 SCUBA-2-selected sources within these Planck overdensity\nfields. The redshift distribution of the sources peak between a redshift of 2\nand 4, with one third of the sources having $S_{500}$/$S_{350} > 1$. For the\nmajority of the sources, we find far-IR luminosities of approximately\n$10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{L}_\\odot$, corresponding to star-formation rates of around\n$1000$ M$_\\odot \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. For $S_{850}>8$ mJy sources, we show that\nthere is up to an order of magnitude increase in star-formation rate density\nand an increase in uncorrected number counts of $6$ for $S_{850}>8$ mJy when\ncompared to typical cosmological survey fields. The sources detected with\nSCUBA-2 account for only approximately $5$ per cent of the Planck flux at 353\nGHz, and thus many more fainter sources are expected in these fields.\n", "  With dozens of Jovian and super-Jovian exoplanets known to orbit their host\nstars in or near the stellar habitable zones, it has recently been suggested\nthat moons the size of Mars could offer abundant surface habitats beyond the\nsolar system. Several searches for such exomoons are now underway, and the\nexquisite astronomical data quality of upcoming space missions and ground-based\nextremely large telescopes could make the detection and characterization of\nexomoons possible in the near future. Here we explore the effects of tidal\nheating on the potential of Mars- to Earth-sized satellites to host liquid\nsurface water, and we compare the tidal heating rates predicted by tidal\nequilibrium model and a viscoelastic model. In addition to tidal heating, we\nconsider stellar radiation, planetary illumination and thermal heat from the\nplanet. However, the effects of a possible moon atmosphere are neglected. We\nmap the circumplanetary habitable zone for different stellar distances in\nspecific star-planet-satellite configurations, and determine those regions\nwhere tidal heating dominates over stellar radiation. We find that the\n`thermostat effect' of the viscoelastic model is significant not just at large\ndistances from the star, but also in the stellar habitable zone, where stellar\nradiation is prevalent. We also find that tidal heating of Mars-sized moons\nwith eccentricities between 0.001 and 0.01 is the dominant energy source beyond\n3--5 AU from a Sun-like star and beyond 0.4--0.6 AU from an M3 dwarf star. The\nlatter would be easier to detect (if they exist), but their orbital stability\nmight be under jeopardy due to the gravitational perturbations from the star.\n", "  We investigate some aspects of the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of\nquantum gases in the presence of inhomogeneous conditions. We consider\nthree-dimensional (3D) quantum gases trapped by an external potential when the\ntemperature is sufficiently low to show a BEC phase region around the center of\nthe trap. If the trap is sufficiently large, different phases may coexist in\ndifferent space regions, when moving from the center of the trap. We show that\nthe quantum gas develops a peculiar critical behavior at the boundary of the\nBEC region, whose scaling behavior is controlled by the universality class of\nthe homogenous BEC transition. We provide numerical evidence of this\nphenomenon, for lattice atomic gases modeled by the 3D Bose-Hubbard\nHamiltonian.\n", "  We construct the most complete sample of supernova remnants (SNRs) in any\ngalaxy - the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SNR sample. We study their various\nproperties such as spectral index ($\\alpha$), size and surface-brightness. We\nsuggest an association between the spatial distribution, environment density of\nLMC SNRs and their tendency to be located around supergiant shells. We find\nevidence that the 16 known type Ia LMC SNRs are expanding in a lower density\nenvironment compared to the Core-Collapse (CC) type. The mean diameter of our\nentire population (74) is 41 pc, which is comparable to nearby galaxies. We\ndidn't find any correlation between the type of SN explosion, ovality or age.\nThe $N(<D)$ relationship of $a={0.96}$ implies that the randomised diameters\nare readily mimicking such an exponent. The rate of SNe occurring in the LMC is\nestimated to be $\\sim$1 per 200 yr. The mean $\\alpha$ of the entire LMC SNR\npopulation is $\\alpha=-0.52$, which is typical of most SNRs. However, our\nestimates show a clear flattening of the synchrotron $\\alpha$ as the remnants\nage. As predicted, our CC SNRs sample are significantly brighter radio emitters\nthan the type Ia remnants. We also estimate the $\\Sigma - D$ relation for the\nLMC to have a slope $\\sim3.8$ which is comparable with other nearby galaxies.\nWe also find the residency time of electrons in the galaxy ($4.0-14.3$ Myr),\nimplying that SNRs should be the dominant mechanism for the production and\nacceleration of CRs.\n", "  Using the phenomenological quantum friction models introduced by\nCaldirola-Kanai, Kostin, and Albrecht, we study quantum tunneling of a\none-dimensional potential in the presence of energy dissipation. To this end,\nwe calculate the tunneling probability using a time-dependent wave packet\nmethod. The friction reduces the tunneling probability. We show that the three\nmodels provide similar penetrabilities to each other, among which the\nCaldirola-Kanai model requires the least numerical effort. We also discuss the\neffect of energy dissipation on quantum tunneling in terms of barrier\ndistributions.\n", "  Context. Observations of Zeeman split spectral lines represent an important\napproach to derive the structure and strength of magnetic fields in molecular\nclouds. In contrast to the uncertainty of the spectral line observation itself,\nthe uncertainty of the analysis method to derive the magnetic field strength\nfrom these observations is not been well characterized so far.\n  Aims. We investigate the impact of several physical quantities on the\nuncertainty of the analysis method, which is used to derive the line-of-sight\n(LOS) magnetic field strength from Zeeman split spectral lines.\n  Methods. We simulate the Zeeman splitting of the 1665 MHz OH line with the 3D\nradiative transfer (RT) extension ZRAD. This extension is based on the line RT\ncode Mol3D (Ober et al. 2015) and has been developed for the POLArized\nRadIation Simulator POLARIS (Reissl et al. 2016).\n  Results. Observations of the OH Zeeman effect in typical molecular clouds are\nnot significantly affected by the uncertainty of the analysis method. We\nderived an approximation to quantify the range of parameters in which the\nanalysis method works sufficiently accurate and provide factors to convert our\nresults to other spectral lines and species as well. We applied these\nconversion factors to CN and found that observations of the CN Zeeman effect in\ntypical molecular clouds are neither significantly affected by the uncertainty\nof the analysis method. In addition, we found that the density has almost no\nimpact on the uncertainty of the analysis method, unless it reaches values\nhigher than those typically found in molecular clouds. Furthermore, the\nuncertainty of the analysis method increases, if both the gas velocity and the\nmagnetic field show significant variations along the line-of-sight. However,\nthis increase should be small in Zeeman observations of most molecular clouds\nconsidering typical velocities of ~1 km/s.\n", "  In this work we discuss the recent criticism by Zdziarski of the maximal jet\nmodel derived in Falcke & Biermann (1995). We agree with Zdziarski that in\ngeneral a jet's internal energy is not bounded by its rest-mass energy density.\nWe describe the effects of the mistake on conclusions that have been made using\nthe maximal jet model and show when a maximal jet is an appropriate assumption.\nThe maximal jet model was used to derive a 1-D hydrodynamical model of jets in\nagnjet, a model that does multiwavelength fitting of quiescent/hard state X-ray\nbinaries and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. We correct algebraic\nmistakes made in the derivation of the 1-D Euler equation and relax the maximal\njet assumption. We show that the corrections cause minor differences as long as\nthe jet has a small opening angle and a small terminal Lorentz factor. We find\nthat the major conclusion from the maximal jet model, the jet-disk symbiosis,\ncan be generally applied to astrophysical jets. We also show that isothermal\njets are required to match the flat radio spectra seen in low-luminosity X-ray\nbinaries and active galactic nuclei, in agreement with other works.\n", "  About 20% of low-redshift galaxies are late-type spirals with a small or no\nbulge component. Although they are the simplest disk galaxies in terms of\nstructure and dynamics, the role of the different physical processes driving\ntheir formation and evolution is not yet fully understood. We investigated\nwhether small bulges of late-type spirals follow the same scaling relations\ntraced by ellipticals and large bulges and if they are disk-like or classical\nbulges. We derived the photometric and kinematic properties of 9 nearby\nlate-type spirals. To this aim, we analyzed the surface brightness distribution\nfrom the i-band images of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and obtained the\nstructural parameters of the galaxies from a two-dimensional photometric\ndecomposition. We measured the line-of-sight stellar velocity distribution\nwithin the bulge effective radius from the long-slit spectra taken with high\nspectral resolution at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. We used the\nphotometric and kinematic properties of the sample bulges to study their\nlocation in the Fundamental Plane, Kormendy, and Faber-Jackson relations\ndefined for ellipticals and large bulges. We found that our sample bulges\nsatisfy some of the photometric and kinematic prescriptions for being\nconsidered disk-like bulges such as small sizes and masses with nearly\nexponential light profiles, small bulge-to-total luminosity ratios, low stellar\nvelocity dispersions, and ongoing star formation. However, each of them follows\nthe same scaling relations of ellipticals, massive bulges, and compact\nearly-type galaxies so they cannot be classified as disk-like systems. We find\na single population of galaxy spheroids that follow the same scaling relations,\nwhere the mass seems to lead to a smooth transition in the photometric and\nkinematic properties from less massive bulges to more massive bulges and\nellipticals.\n", "  We present the first systematic study of the gravitational collapse of\nrotating and magnetised neutron stars to charged and rotating (Kerr-Newman)\nblack holes. In particular, we consider the collapse of magnetised and rotating\nneutron stars assuming that no pair-creation takes place and that the charge\ndensity in the magnetosphere is so low that the stellar exterior can be\ndescribed as an electrovacuum. Under these assumptions, which are rather\nreasonable for a pulsar that has crossed the 'death line', we show that when\nthe star is rotating, it acquires a net initial electrical charge, which is\nthen trapped inside the apparent horizon of the newly formed back hole. We\nanalyse a number of different quantities to validate that the black hole\nproduced is indeed a Kerr-Newman one and show that, in the absence of rotation\nor magnetic field, the end result of the collapse is a Schwarzschild or Kerr\nblack hole, respectively.\n", "  In this work we use the semi-empirical atmospheric modeling method to obtain\nthe chro-mospheric temperature, pressure, density and magnetic field\ndistribution versus height in the K2 primary component of the RS CVn binary\nsystem HR 7428. While temperature, pressure, density are the standard output of\nthe semi-empirical modeling technique, the chromospheric magnetic field\nestimation versus height comes from considering the possibility of not\nim-posing hydrostatic equilibrium in the semi-empirical computation. The\nstability of the best non-hydrostatic equilibrium model, implies the presence\nof an additive (toward the center of the star) pressure, that decreases in\nstrength from the base of the chromosphere toward the outer layers.\nInterpreting the additive pressure as magnetic pressure we estimated a magnetic\nfield intensity of about 500 gauss at the base of the chromosphere.\n", "  We built a catalog of 122 FR~II radio galaxies, called FRII{\\sl{CAT}},\nselected from a published sample obtained by combining observations from the\nNVSS, FIRST, and SDSS surveys. The catalog includes sources with redshift $\\leq\n0.15$, an edge-brightened radio morphology, and those with at least one of the\nemission peaks located at radius $r$ larger than 30 kpc from the center of the\nhost. The radio luminosity at 1.4 GHz of the \\FRII\\ sources covers the range\n$L_{1.4} \\sim 10^{39.5} - 10^{42.5}$ $\\ergs$. The \\FRII\\ catalog has 90\\% of\nlow and 10\\% of high excitation galaxies (LEGs and HEGs), respectively. The\nproperties of these two classes are significantly different. The FRII{\\sl{CAT}}\nLEGs are mostly luminous ($-20 \\gtrsim M_r \\gtrsim -24$), red early-type\ngalaxies with black hole masses in the range $10^8 \\lesssim M_{\\rm BH} \\lesssim\n10^9 M_\\odot$; they are essentially indistinguishable from the FR~Is belonging\nto the FRI{\\sl{CAT}}. The HEG FR~IIs are associated with optically bluer and\nmid-IR redder hosts than the LEG FR~IIs and to galaxies and black holes that\nare smaller, on average, by a factor $\\sim$2.\n  FR~IIs have a factor $\\sim$ 3 higher average radio luminosity than FR~Is.\nNonetheless, most ($\\sim 90$ \\%) of the selected FR~IIs have a radio power that\nis lower, by as much as a factor of $\\sim$100, than the transition value\nbetween FR~Is and FR~IIs found in the 3C sample. The correspondence between the\nmorphological classification of FR~I and FR~II and the separation in radio\npower disappears when including sources selected at low radio flux thresholds,\nwhich is in line with previous results. In conclusion, a radio source produced\nby a low power jet can be edge brightened or edge darkened, and the outcome is\nnot related to differences in the optical properties of the host galaxy.\n", "  In magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, the large-scale magnetic field sets\na preferred local direction for the small-scale dynamics, altering the\nstatistics of turbulence from the isotropic case. This happens even in the\nabsence of a total magnetic flux, since MHD turbulence forms randomly oriented\nlarge-scale domains of strong magnetic field. It is therefore customary to\nstudy small-scale magnetic plasma turbulence by assuming a strong background\nmagnetic field relative to the turbulent fluctuations. This is done, for\nexample, in reduced models of plasmas, such as reduced MHD, reduced-dimension\nkinetic models, gyrokinetics, etc., which make theoretical calculations easier\nand numerical computations cheaper. Recently, however, it has become clear that\nthe turbulent energy dissipation is concentrated in the regions of strong\nmagnetic field variations. A significant fraction of the energy dissipation may\nbe localized in very small volumes corresponding to the boundaries between\nstrongly magnetized domains. In these regions the reduced models are not\napplicable. This has important implications for studies of particle heating and\nacceleration in magnetic plasma turbulence. The goal of this work is to\nsystematically investigate the relationship between local magnetic field\nvariations and magnetic energy dissipation, and to understand its implications\nfor modeling energy dissipation in realistic turbulent plasmas.\n", "  The scalar septet model extends the Standard Model Higgs sector by an isospin\nseptet with hypercharge chosen to preserve $\\rho \\equiv M_W^2/M_Z^2\n\\cos^2\\theta_W = 1$. In this paper we constrain the model at high septet masses\nusing perturbative unitarity of longitudinal vector boson scattering\namplitudes. We also apply the constraints from LHC searches for doubly-charged\nHiggs bosons produced in vector boson fusion, which constrain the model at\nlower septet masses. We point out some important differences between the septet\nmodel and extended Higgs models that preserve custodial symmetry in the scalar\nspectrum.\n", "  An analysis of globular cluster systems associated with galaxies included in\nthe Virgo and Fornax HST Advanced Camera Surveys reveals distinct (g-z) colour\nmodulation patterns. These features appear on composite samples of globular\nclusters and, most evidently, in galaxies with absolute magnitudes Mg in the\nrange from -20.2 to -19.2. These colour modulations are also detectable on some\nsamples of globular clusters in the central galaxies NGC 1399 and NGC 4486 (and\nconfirmed on data sets obtained with different instruments and photometric\nsystems), as well as in other bright galaxies in these clusters. After\ndiscarding field contamination, photometric errors and statistical effects, we\nconclude that these supra-galactic colour patterns are real and reflect some\npreviously unknown characteristic. These features suggest that the globular\ncluster formation process was not entirely stochastic but included a fraction\nof clusters that formed in a rather synchronized fashion over large spatial\nscales, and in a tentative time lapse of about 1.5 Gy at redshifts z between 2\nand 4. We speculate that the putative mechanism leading to that synchronism may\nbe associated with large scale feedback effects connected with violent star\nforming events and/or with super massive black holes.\n", "  We use the latest version of the metal line absorption catalogue of Zhu &\nM\\'enard (2013) to study the clustering of MgII absorbers around massive\ngalaxies (~10^11.5 M_sun), quasars and radio-loud AGN with redshifts between\n0.4 and 0.75. Clustering is evaluated in two dimensions, by binning absorbers\nboth in projected radius and in velocity separation. Excess MgII is detected\naround massive galaxies out to R_p=20 Mpc. At projected radii less than 800\nkpc, the excess extends out to velocity separations of 10,000 km/s. The extent\nof the high velocity tail within this radius is independent of the mean stellar\nage of the galaxy and whether or not it harbours an active galactic nucleus. We\ninterpret our results using the publicly available Illustris and Millennium\nsimulations. Models where the MgII absorbers trace the dark matter particle or\nsubhalo distributions do not fit the data. They overpredict the clustering on\nsmall scales and do not reproduce the excess high velocity separation MgII\nabsorbers seen within the virial radius of the halo. The Illustris simulations\nwhich include thermal, but not mechanical feedback from AGN, also do not\nprovide an adequate fit to the properties of the cool halo gas within the\nvirial radius. We propose that the large velocity separation MgII absorbers\ntrace gas that has been pushed out of the dark matter halos, possibly by\nmultiple episodes of AGN-driven mechanical feedback acting over long\ntimescales.\n", "  The $\\Xi_c^+ K^-$ mass spectrum is studied with a sample of $pp$ collision\ndata corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.3 fb$^{-1}$, collected by\nthe LHCb experiment. The $\\Xi_c^+$ is reconstructed in the decay mode $p K^-\n\\pi^+$. Five new, narrow excited $\\Omega_c^0$ states are observed: the\n$\\Omega_c(3000)^0$, $\\Omega_c(3050)^0$, $\\Omega_c(3066)^0$, $\\Omega_c(3090)^0$,\nand $\\Omega_c(3119)^0$. Measurements of their masses and widths are reported.\n", "  We carry out a comparative analysis of the performance of three algorithms\nwidely used to identify significant periodicities in radial-velocity (RV)\ndatasets: the Generalised Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (GLS), its modified version\nbased on Bayesian statistics (BGLS), and the multi-frequency periodogram scheme\ncalled FREquency DEComposer (FREDEC). We apply the algorithms to a suite of\nnumerical simulations of (single and multiple) low-amplitude Keplerian RV\nsignals induced by low-mass companions around M-dwarf primaries. The global\nperformance of the three period search approaches is quite similar in the limit\nof an idealized, best-case scenario (single planets, circular orbits, white\nnoise). However, GLS, BGLS and FREDEC are not equivalent when it comes to the\ncorrect identification of more complex signals (including correlated noise of\nstellar origin, eccentric orbits, multiple planets), with variable degrees of\nefficiency loss as a function of system parameters and degradation in\ncompleteness and reliability levels. The largest discrepancy is recorded in the\nnumber of false detections: the standard approach of residual analyses adopted\nfor GLS and BGLS translates in large fractions of false alarms ($\\sim30\\%$) in\nthe case of multiple systems, as opposed to $\\sim10\\%$ for the FREDEC approach\nof simultaneous multi-frequency search. Our results reinforce the need for the\nstrengthening and further development of the most aggressive and effective {\\it\nab initio} strategies for the robust identification of low-amplitude planetary\nsignals in RV datasets, particularly now that RV surveys are beginning to\nachieve sensitivity to potentially habitable Earth-mass planets around\nlate-type stars.\n", "  Ton 34 recently transitioned from non-absorbing quasar into a BALQSO.Here, we\nreport new HST-STIS observations of this quasar. Along with CIV absorption, we\nalso detect absorption by NV+Ly alpha and possibly OVI+Ly beta. We follow the\nevolution of the CIV BAL, and find that, for the slower outflowing material,\nthe absorption trough varies little (if at all) on a rest-frame timescale of 2\nyr. However, we detect a strong deepening of the absorption in the gas moving\nat larger velocities (-20,000 - -23,000 km s-1). The data is consistent with a\nmultistreaming flow crossing our line of sight to the source. The transverse\nvelocity of the flow should be few thousand km s-1, similar to the rotation\nvelocity of the BLR gas (2,600 km s-1). By simply assuming Keplerian motion,\nthese two components must have similar locations, pointing to a common outflow\nforming the BLR and the BAL. We speculate that BALs, mini-BALs, and NALs, are\npart of a common, ubiquitous, accretion-disk outflow in AGN, but become\nobservable depending on the viewing angle towards the flow. The absorption\ntroughs suggest a wind covering only 20% of the emitting source, implying a\nmaximum size of 10^-3 pc for the clouds forming the BAL/BLR medium. This is\nconsistent with constraints of the BLR clouds from X-ray occultations. Finally,\nwe suggest that the low excitation broad emission lines detected in the spectra\nof this source lie beyond the wind, and this gas is probably excited by the\nshock of the BAL wind with the surrounding medium.\n", "  We report results from the high resolution spectral analysis of the 107 metal\nrich (mostly [Fe/H]$\\ge$7.67 dex) target stars from the Calan-Hertfordshire\nExtrasolar Planet Search program observed with HARPS. Using our procedure of\nfinding the best fit to the absorption line profiles in the observed spectra,\nwe measure the abundances of Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and\nZn, and we then compare them with known results from different authors. Most of\nour abundances agree with these works at the level of $\\pm$0.05 dex or better\nfor the stars we have in common. However, we do find systematic differences\nthat make direct inferences difficult. Our analysis suggests that the selection\nof line lists and atomic line data along with the adopted continuum level\ninfluence these differences the most. At the same time, we confirm the positive\ntrends of abundances versus metallicity for Na, Mn, Ni, and to a lesser degree,\nAl. A slight negative trend is observed for Ca, whereas Si and Cr tend to\nfollow iron. Our analysis allows us to determine the positively skewed normal\ndistribution of projected rotational velocities with a maximum peaking at 3 km\ns$^{-1}$. Finally, we obtained a Gaussian distribution of microturbulent\nvelocities that has a maximum at 1.2 km s$^{-1}$ and a full width at half\nmaximum $\\Delta v_{1/2}=$0.35 km s$^{-1}$, indicating that metal rich dwarfs\nand subgiants in our sample have a very restricted range in microturbulent\nvelocity.\n", "  We aim to explore the capabilities of dust emission and rays for probing the\nproperties of the interstellar medium in the nearby anti-centre region, using\ngamma-ray observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), and the\nthermal dust optical depth inferred from Planck and IRAS observations. In\nparticular, we aim at quantifying potential variations in cosmic-ray density\nand dust properties per gas nucleon across the different gas phases and\ndifferent clouds, and at measuring the CO-to-H2 conversion factor, X$_{CO}$ ,\nin different environments. We have separated six nearby anti-centre clouds that\nare coherent in velocities and distances, from the Galactic-disc background in\nHI 21-cm and $^{12}$CO 2.6-mm line emission. We have jointly modelled the\ngamma-ray intensity recorded between 0.4 and 100 GeV, and the dust optical\ndepth at 353 GHz as a combination of HI-bright, CO-bright, and ionised gas\ncomponents. The complementary information from dust emission and gamma rays was\nused to reveal the gas not seen, or poorly traced, by HI , free-free, and\n$^{12}$CO emissions, namely (i) the opaque HI and diffuse H$_2$ present in the\nDark Neutral Medium at the atomic-molecular transition, and (ii) the dense\nH$_2$ to be added where $^{12}$CO lines saturate. The measured interstellar\ngamma-ray spectra support a uniform penetration of the cosmic rays with\nenergies above a few GeV through the clouds. We find a gradual increase in\ngrain opacity as the gas becomes more dense. The increase reaches a factor of\nfour to six in the cold molecular regions that are well shielded from stellar\nradiation. Consequently, the X$_{CO}$ factor derived from dust is\nsystematically larger by 30% to 130% than the gamma-ray estimate. We also\nevaluate the average gamma-ray X$_{CO}$ factorfor each cloud, and find that\nX$_{CO}$ tends to decrease from diffuse to more compact molecular clouds, as\nexpected from theory.\n", "  A method to determine the spin temperature of the local (Vlsr=0 km/s) HI gas\nusing saturated brightness temperature of the 21-cm line in the radial-velocity\ndegenerate regions (VDR) is presented. The spin temperatures is determined to\nbe Ts= 146.2 +/- 16.1 K by measuring saturated brightness in the VDR toward the\nGalactic Center, 146.8 +/- 10.7 K by chi^2 fitting of expected brightness\ndistribution to observation around the VDR, and 144.4 +/- 6.8 K toward the\nlocal arm. Assuming Ts=146 K, a correction factor Gamma for the HI density,\ndefined by the ratio of the true HI density for finite optical thickness to\nthat calculated by assuming optically thin HI, was obtained to be Gamma~1.2\n(optical depth tau~0.3) in the local HI gas, ~1.8 (~1.3) toward the arm and\nanti-center, and as high as ~3.6 (~2.7) in the Galactic Center direction. It is\nsuggested that the HI density and mass in the local arm could be ~2 times, and\nthat in the inner Galaxy ~3.6 times, greater than the currently estimated\nvalues.\n", "  We carry out a systematic investigation of the total mass density profile of\nmassive (Mstar>2e11 Msun) early-type galaxies and its dependence on galactic\nproperties and host halo mass with the aid of a variety of lensing/dynamical\ndata and large mock galaxy catalogs. The latter are produced via semi-empirical\nmodels that, by design, are based on just a few basic input assumptions.\nGalaxies, with measured stellar masses, effective radii and S\\'{e}rsic indices,\nare assigned, via abundance matching relations, host dark matter halos\ncharacterized by a typical LCDM profile. Our main results are as follows: (i)\nIn line with observational evidence, our semi-empirical models naturally\npredict that the total, mass-weighted density slope at the effective radius\ngamma' is not universal, steepening for more compact and/or massive galaxies,\nbut flattening with increasing host halo mass. (ii) Models characterized by a\nSalpeter or variable initial mass function and uncontracted dark matter\nprofiles are in good agreement with the data, while a Chabrier initial mass\nfunction and/or adiabatic contractions/expansions of the dark matter halos are\nhighly disfavored. (iii) Currently available data on the mass density profiles\nof very massive galaxies (Mstar>1e12 Msun), with Mhalo>3e14 Msun, favor instead\nmodels with a stellar profile flatter than a S\\'{e}rsic one in the very inner\nregions (r<3-5 kpc), and a cored NFW or Einasto dark matter profile with median\nhalo concentration a factor of ~2 or <1.3, respectively, higher than those\ntypically predicted by N-body numerical simulations.\n", "  We compare six models (including the baryonic model, two dark matter models,\ntwo modified Newtonian dynamics models and one modified gravity model) in\naccounting for the galaxy rotation curves. For the dark matter models, we\nassume NFW profile and core-modified profile for the dark halo, respectively.\nFor the modified Newtonian dynamics models, we discuss Milgrom's MOND theory\nwith two different interpolation functions, i.e. the standard and the simple\ninterpolation functions. As for the modified gravity, we focus on Moffat's MSTG\ntheory. We fit these models to the observed rotation curves of 9 high-surface\nbrightness and 9 low-surface brightness galaxies. We apply the Bayesian\nInformation Criterion and the Akaike Information Criterion to test the\ngoodness-of-fit of each model. It is found that non of the six models can well\nfit all the galaxy rotation curves. Two galaxies can be best fitted by the\nbaryonic model without involving the nonluminous dark matter. MOND can fit the\nlargest number of galaxies, and only one galaxy can be best fitted by MSTG\nmodel. Core-modified model can well fit about one half LSB galaxies but no HSB\ngalaxy, while NFW model can fit only a small fraction of HSB galaxies but no\nLSB galaxy. This may imply that the oversimplified NFW and Core-modified\nprofiles couldn't well mimic the postulated dark matter halo.\n", "  Swift monitoring of NGC 4151 with ~6 hr sampling over a total of 69 days in\nearly 2016 is used to construct light curves covering five bands in the X-rays\n(0.3-50 keV) and six in the ultraviolet (UV)/optical (1900-5500 A). The three\nhardest X-ray bands (>2.5 keV) are all strongly correlated with no measurable\ninterband lag while the two softer bands show lower variability and weaker\ncorrelations. The UV/optical bands are significantly correlated with the\nX-rays, lagging ~3-4 days behind the hard X-rays. The variability within the\nUV/optical bands is also strongly correlated, with the UV appearing to lead the\noptical by ~0.5-1 day. This combination of >~3 day lags between the X-rays and\nUV and <~1 day lags within the UV/optical appears to rule out the \"lamp-post\"\nreprocessing model in which a hot, X-ray emitting corona directly illuminates\nthe accretion disk, which then reprocesses the energy in the UV/optical.\nInstead, these results appear consistent with the Gardner & Done picture in\nwhich two separate reprocessings occur: first, emission from the corona\nilluminates an extreme-UV-emitting toroidal component that shields the disk\nfrom the corona; this then heats the extreme-UV component which illuminates the\ndisk and drives its variability.\n", "  Solar neutrinos interact within double-beta decay (\\BB) detectors and\ncontribute to backgrounds for \\BB\\ experiments. Background contributions due to\nsolar neutrino interactions with \\BB\\ nuclei of $^{82}$Se, $^{100}$Mo, and\n$^{150}$Nd are evaluated. They are shown to be significant for future\nhigh-sensitivity \\BB\\ experiments that may search for Majorana neutrino masses\nin the inverted-hierarchy mass region. The impact of solar neutrino backgrounds\nand their reduction are discussed for future \\BB\\ experiments.\n", "  In this work we quantify the performance of $LSST$ on the detection of\neclipsing binaries. We use $Kepler$ observed binaries to create a large sample\nof simulated pseudo-$LSST$ binary light curves. From these light curves, we\nattempt to recover the known binary signal. The success rate of period recovery\nfrom the pseudo-$LSST$ light curves is indicative of $LSST$'s expected\nperformance. Using an off-the-shelf Analysis of Variance (AoV) routine, we\nsuccessfully recover 71% of the targets in our sample. We examine how the\nbinary period impacts recovery success and see that for periods longer than\n10~days the chance of successful binary recovery drops below 50%.\n", "  We present the spectroscopic and photometric late-time follow-up of the host\ngalaxy of the long-duration Swift gamma-ray burst GRB 140506A at z = 0.889. The\noptical and near-infrared afterglow of this GRB had a peculiar spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) with a strong flux-drop at 8000 {\\AA} (4000 {\\AA}\nrest-frame) suggesting an unusually steep extinction curve. By analyzing the\ncontribution and physical properties of the host galaxy, we here aim at\nproviding additional information on the properties and origin of this steep,\nnon-standard extinction. We find that the strong flux-drop in the GRB afterglow\nspectrum at < 8000 {\\AA} and rise at < 4000 {\\AA} is well explained by the\ncombination of a steep extinction curve along the GRB line of sight and\ncontamination by the host galaxy light so that the scenario with an extreme\n2175 {\\AA} extinction bump can be excluded. We localise the GRB to be at a\nprojected distance of approximately 4 kpc from the centre of the host galaxy.\nBased on emission-line diagnostics of the four detected nebular lines, Halpha,\nHbeta, [O II] and [O III], we find the host to be a modestly star forming (SFR\n= 1.34 +/- 0.04 Msun yr^-1) and relatively metal poor (Z = 0.35^{+0.15}_{-0.11}\nZsun) galaxy with a large dust content, characterized by a measured visual\nattenuation of A_V = 1.74 +/- 0.41 mag, thus unexceptional in all its physical\nproperties. We model the extinction curve of the host-corrected afterglow and\nshow that the standard dust properties causing the reddening seen in the Local\nGroup are inadequate in describing the steep drop. We conclude that the steep\nextinction curve seen in the afterglow towards the GRB is of exotic origin, is\nsightline-dependent only and thus solely a consequence of the circumburst\nenvironment.\n", "  We report the results from a recent 133 ks XMM-Newton observation of a highly\nsuper-Eddington narrow-line Type-1 QSO RX J0439.6-5311. This source has one of\nthe steepest AGN hard X-ray slopes, in addition to a prominent and smooth soft\nX-ray excess. Strong variations are found throughout the 0.3 to 10 keV energy\nrange on all time-scales covered by the observation, with the soft excess\nmainly showing low frequency variations below 0.1 mHz while the hard X-rays\nshow stronger variability at higher frequencies. We perform a full set of\nspectral-timing analysis on the X-ray data, including a simultaneous modelling\nof the time-average spectra, frequency-dependent RMS and covariance spectra,\nlag-frequency and lag-energy spectra. Especially, we find a significant\ntime-lag signal in the low frequency band, which indicates that the soft X-rays\nlead the hard by $\\sim$4 ks, with a broad continuum-like profile in the lag\nspectrum. Our analysis strongly supports the model where the soft X-ray excess\nis dominated by a separate low temperature, optically thick Comptonisation\ncomponent rather than relativistic reflection or a jet. This soft X-ray\nemitting region is several tens or hundreds of $R_{g}$ away from the hot corona\nemitting hard X-rays, and is probably associated with a geometrically thick\n(`puffed-up') inner disc region.\n", "  We introduce the affine OBDD model and show that zero-error affine OBDDs can\nbe exponentially narrower than bounded-error unitary and probabilistic OBDDs on\ncertain problems. Moreover, we show that Las Vegas unitary and probabilistic\nOBDDs can be quadratically narrower than deterministic OBDDs. We also obtain\nthe same results by considering the automata versions of these models.\n", "  Context. The structure of the inner parts of Be star disks (20 stellar radii)\nis well explained by the viscous decretion disk (VDD) model, which is able to\nreproduce the observable properties of most of the objects studied so far. The\nouter parts, on the ther hand, are not observationally well-explored, as they\nare observable only at radio wavelengths. A steepening of the spectral slope\nsomewhere between infrared and radio wavelengths was reported for several Be\nstars that were previously detected in the radio, but a convincing physical\nexplanation for this trend has not yet been provided. Aims. We test the VDD\nmodel predictions for the extended parts of a sample of six Be disks that have\nbeen observed in the radio to address the question of whether the observed\nturndown in the spectral energy distribution (SED) can be explained in the\nframework of the VDD model, including recent theoretical development for\ntruncated Be disks in binary systems. Methods. We combine new multi-wavelength\nradio observations from the Karl. G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) and Atacama\nPathfinder Experiment (APEX) with previously published radio data and archival\nSED measurements at ultraviolet, visual, and infrared wavelengths. The density\nstructure of the disks, including their outer parts, is constrained by\nradiative transfer modeling of the observed spectrum using VDD model\npredictions. In the VDD model we include the presumed effects of possible tidal\ninfluence from faint binary companions. Results. For 5 out of 6 studied stars,\nthe observed SED shows strong signs of SED turndown between far-IR and radio\nwavelengths. A VDD model that extends to large distances closely reproduces the\nobserved SEDs up to far IR wavelengths, but fails to reproduce the radio SED.\n... (abstract continues but did not fit here)\n", "  We present the WiFeS Atlas of Galactic Globular cluster Spectra, a library of\nintegrated spectra of Milky Way and Local Group globular clusters. We used the\nWiFeS integral field spectrograph on the Australian National University 2.3 m\ntelescope to observe the central regions of 64 Milky Way globular clusters and\n22 globular clusters hosted by the Milky Way's low mass satellite galaxies. The\nspectra have wider wavelength coverage (3300 {\\AA} to 9050 {\\AA}) and higher\nspectral resolution (R = 6800) than existing spectral libraries of Milky Way\nglobular clusters. By including Large and Small Magellanic Cloud star clusters,\nwe extend the coverage of parameter space of existing libraries towards young\nand intermediate ages. While testing stellar population synthesis models and\nanalysis techniques is the main aim of this library, the observations may also\nfurther our understanding of the stellar populations of Local Group globular\nclusters and make possible the direct comparison of extragalactic globular\ncluster integrated light observations with well understood globular clusters in\nthe Milky Way. The integrated spectra are publicly available via the project\nwebsite.\n", "  We prepared superconducting and non-superconducting FeSe films on SrTiO3(001)\nsubstrates (FeSe/STO) and investigated the superconducting transition induced\nby charge transfer between organic molecules and FeSe layers by low temperature\nscanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. At low coverage, donor- and\nacceptor-type molecules adsorbed preferentially on the non-superconducting and\nsuperconducting FeSe layers, respectively. Superconductivity was induced by\ndonor molecules on non-superconducting FeSe layer, while the superconductivity\nwas suppressed near acceptor molecules. The corresponding evolutions of\nelectronic states and work function were also resolved by scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy. These results illustrate the important role played by local\nelectron concentration in the superconducting transition of FeSe/STO.\n", "  We present Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MegaCam observations of a\ngalaxy-quasar strong gravitational lens system, SDSS J1640+1932. This system,\nlocated at z=0.195 (foreground elliptical galaxy) and z=0.778 (background\nquasar), was first visually identified by us in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) database. Our CFHT imaging with an angular resolution of 0.7$^{\\prime\n\\prime}$ clearly resolves 4 lensed images and a nearly complete Einstein ring.\nModeling the system with a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) total mass\ndistribution, we find an Einstein radius of ${2.49^{\\prime\n\\prime}}_{-0.049}^{+0.063}$ enclosing a inferred mass of\n$7.25_{-0.29}^{+0.37}\\times10^{11} M_{\\odot}$. The quasar and its host galaxy\nhave been magnified by a factor of 23, and the time delay relative to the\nleading image is determined to be 23.4-25.2 days. These parameters vary\nminimally when our model is fitted to the {\\it{g}}-, {\\it{r}}- or {\\it{i}}-band\nimages.\n", "  We investigate the asymptotic security of one-way continuous variable quantum\nkey distribution against Gaussian two-mode coherent attacks. The one-way\nprotocol is implemented by arranging the channel uses in two-mode blocks. By\napplying symmetric random permutations over these blocks, the security analysis\nis in fact reduced to study two-mode coherent attacks and, in particular,\nGaussian ones, due to the extremality of Gaussian states. We explicitly show\nthat the use of two-mode Gaussian correlations by an eavesdropper leads to\nasymptotic secret key rates which are strictly larger than the rate obtained\nunder standard single-mode Gaussian attacks.\n", "  We set limits on the presence of the synchrotron cosmic web through the\ncross-correlation of the 2.3 GHz S-PASS survey with a model of the local cosmic\nweb derived from constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. The MHD\nsimulation assumes cosmologically seeded magnetic fields amplified during\nlarge-scale structure formation, and a population of relativistic\nelectrons/positrons from proton-proton collisions within the intergalactic\nmedium. We set a model-dependent 3$\\sigma$ upper limit on the synchrotron\nsurface brightness of 0.16 mJy arcmin$^{-2}$ at 2.3 GHz in filaments.\nExtrapolating from magnetic field maps created from the simulation, we infer an\nupper limit (density-weighted) magnetic field of 0.03 (0.13) $\\mu$G in\nfilaments at the current epoch, and a limit on the primordial magnetic field\n(PMF) of B$_{PMF}$~1.0 nG.\n", "  We carried out multiwavelength (0.7-5 cm), multiepoch (1994-2015) Very Large\nArray (VLA) observations toward the region enclosing the bright far-IR sources\nFIR 3 (HOPS 370) and FIR 4 (HOPS 108) in OMC-2. We report the detection of 10\nradio sources, seven of them identified as young stellar objects. We image a\nwell-collimated radio jet with a thermal free-free core (VLA 11) associated\nwith the Class I intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370. The jet presents several\nknots (VLA 12N, 12C, 12S) of non-thermal radio emission (likely synchrotron\nfrom shock-accelerated relativistic electrons) at distances of ~7,500-12,500 au\nfrom the protostar, in a region where other shock tracers have been previously\nidentified. These knots are moving away from the HOPS 370 protostar at ~ 100\nkm/s. The Class 0 protostar HOPS 108, which itself is detected as an\nindependent, kinematically decoupled radio source, falls in the path of these\nnon-thermal radio knots. These results favor the previously proposed scenario\nwhere the formation of HOPS 108 has been triggered by the impact of the HOPS\n370 outflow with a dense clump. However, HOPS 108 presents a large proper\nmotion velocity of ~ 30 km/s, similar to that of other runaway stars in Orion,\nwhose origin would be puzzling within this scenario. Alternatively, an apparent\nproper motion could result because of changes in the position of the centroid\nof the source due to blending with nearby extended emission, variations in the\nsource shape, and /or opacity effects.\n", "  A large lepton number asymmetry of $\\mathcal{O}(0.1-1)$ at present universe\nmight not only be allowed but also necessary for consistency among cosmological\ndata. We show that, if a sizeable lepton number asymmetry were produced before\nthe electroweak phase transition, the requirement for not producing too much\nbaryon number asymmetry through sphalerons processes, forces the high scale\nlepton number asymmetry to be larger than about $30$. Therefore a mild entropy\nrelease causing $\\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ suppression of pre-existing particle\ndensity should take place, when the background temperature of the universe is\naround $T = \\mathcal{O}(10^{-2} - 10^2) {\\rm GeV}$ for a large but\nexperimentally consistent asymmetry to be present today. We also show that such\na mild entropy production can be obtained by the late-time decays of the\nsaxion, constraining the parameters of the Peccei-Quinn sector such as the mass\nand the vacuum expectation value of the saxion field to be $m_\\phi \\gtrsim\n\\mathcal{O}(10) {\\rm TeV}$ and $\\phi_0 \\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(10^{14}) {\\rm GeV}$,\nrespectively.\n", "  CO--0.40--0.22 is a peculiar molecular cloud that is compact and has an\nextraordinary broad velocity width. It is found in the central molecular zone\nof our Galaxy. In this direction, there is another cloud with an H$_2$O maser\nspot at a lower velocity. Collision with this low-velocity cloud could be\nresponsible for the broad velocity width of CO--0.40--0.22. We performed\nphase-referencing VLBI astrometry with VERA and detected the annual parallax of\nthe H$_2$O maser spot in the low-velocity cloud to be $0.33 \\pm 0.14$ mas,\nwhich corresponds to a distance of $3.07^{+2.22}_{-0.91}$ kpc from the Sun.\nThis implies that the low-velocity cloud is located in the Galactic disk on the\nnear side of the central molecular zone.\n", "  It is shown that the time-variability inherent in the ion-proton polar cap\nleads naturally to growth of Langmuir modes on narrow bundles of magnetic flux\nlines and that the observed size of micropulses is consistent with the smallest\nsuch bundle that can plausibly support the growth of the modes. The\npolarization of integrated profiles is revisited, specifically, the pi/2\nposition-angle jumps that are frequently observed accompanied by a zero in\npolarization. The fact that radiation emitted above ion-proton polar caps is\nnot tangential to the local flux lines but has a finite angular distribution\nproves to be the essence of understanding this phenomenon as is a constraint on\nthe shape of the polar cap. In principle, the behaviour should also be seen if\nthe form of the polar-cap ion-proton area in a single pulse satisfies certain\nconditions which are explained here.\n", "  The O8f?p star HD 108 is implied to have experienced the most extreme\nrotational braking of any magnetic, massive star, with a rotational period\n$P_{\\rm rot}$ of at least 55 years, but the upper limit on its spindown\ntimescale is over twice the age estimated from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.\nHD 108's observed X-ray luminosity is also much higher than predicted by the\nXADM model, a unique discrepancy amongst magnetic O-type stars. Previously\nreported magnetic data cover only a small fraction ($\\sim$3.5\\%) of $P_{\\rm\nrot}$, and were furthermore acquired when the star was in a photometric and\nspectroscopic `low state' at which the longitudinal magnetic field $\\langle\nB_z\\rangle$~was likely at a minimum. We have obtained a new ESPaDOnS magnetic\nmeasurement of HD 108, 6 years after the last reported measurement. The star is\nreturning to a spectroscopic high state, although its emission lines are still\nbelow their maximum observed strength, consistent with the proposed 55-year\nperiod. We measured $\\langle B_z\\rangle=-325 \\pm 45$ G, twice the strength of\nthe 2007-2009 observations, raising the lower limit of the dipole surface\nmagnetic field strength to $B_{\\rm d} \\ge 1$ kG. The simultaneous increase in\n$\\langle B_z\\rangle$~and emission strength is consistent with the oblique\nrotator model. Extrapolation of the $\\langle B_z\\rangle$~maximum via comparison\nof HD 108's spectroscopic and magnetic data with the similar Of?p star HD\n191612 suggests that $B_{\\rm d} > 2$~kG, yielding $t_{\\rm S, max}<3$~Myr,\ncompatible with the stellar age. These results also yield a better agreement\nbetween the observed X-ray luminosity and that predicted by the XADM model.\n", "  Stars form in cold molecular clouds. However, molecular gas is difficult to\nobserve because the most abundant molecule (H2) lacks a permanent dipole\nmoment. Rotational transitions of CO are often used as a tracer of H2, but CO\nis much less abundant and the conversion from CO intensity to H2 mass is often\nhighly uncertain. Here we present a new method for estimating the column\ndensity of cold molecular gas (Sigma_gas) using optical spectroscopy. We\nutilise the spatially resolved H-alpha maps of flux and velocity dispersion\nfrom the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral-field spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy\nSurvey. We derive maps of Sigma_gas by inverting the multi-freefall star\nformation relation, which connects the star formation rate surface density\n(Sigma_SFR) with Sigma_gas and the turbulent Mach number (Mach). Based on the\nmeasured range of Sigma_SFR = 0.005-1.5 M_sol/yr/kpc^2 and Mach = 18-130, we\npredict Sigma_gas = 7-200 M_sol/pc^2 in the star-forming regions of our sample\nof 260 SAMI galaxies. These values are close to previously measured Sigma_gas\nobtained directly with unresolved CO observations of similar galaxies at low\nredshift. We classify each galaxy in our sample as 'Star-forming' (219) or\n'Composite/AGN/Shock' (41), and find that in Composite/AGN/Shock galaxies the\naverage Sigma_SFR, Mach, and Sigma_gas are enhanced by factors of 2.0, 1.6, and\n1.3, respectively, compared to Star-forming galaxies. We compare our\npredictions of Sigma_gas with those obtained by inverting the Kennicutt-Schmidt\nrelation and find that our new method is a factor of two more accurate in\npredicting Sigma_gas, with an average deviation of 32% from the actual\nSigma_gas.\n", "  We report on unusually very hard spectral states in three confirmed\nneutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries (1RXS J180408.9-342058, EXO 1745-248, and\nIGR J18245-2452) at a luminosity between ~ 10^{36-37} erg s^{-1}. When fitting\nthe Swift X-ray spectra (0.5 - 10 keV) in those states with an absorbed\npower-law model, we found photon indices of \\Gamma ~ 1, significantly lower\nthan the \\Gamma = 1.5 - 2.0 typically seen when such systems are in their so\ncalled hard state. For individual sources very hard spectra were already\npreviously identified but here we show for the first time that likely our\nsources were in a distinct spectral state (i.e., different from the hard state)\nwhen they exhibited such very hard spectra. It is unclear how such very hard\nspectra can be formed; if the emission mechanism is similar to that operating\nin their hard states (i.e., up-scattering of soft photons due to hot electrons)\nthen the electrons should have higher temperatures or a higher optical depth in\nthe very hard state compared to those observed in the hard state. By using our\nobtained \\Gamma as a tracer for the spectral evolution with luminosity, we have\ncompared our results with those obtained by Wijnands et al. (2015). We confirm\ntheir general results in that also our sample of sources follow the same track\nas the other neutron star systems, although we do not find that the accreting\nmillisecond pulsars are systematically harder than the non-pulsating systems.\n", "  In this paper, we deform the thermodynamics of a BTZ black hole from rainbow\nfunctions in gravity's rainbow. The rainbow functions will be motivated from\nresults in loop quantum gravity and Noncommutative geometry. It will be\nobserved that the thermodynamics gets deformed due to these rainbow functions,\nindicating the existence of a remnant. However, the Gibbs free energy does not\nget deformed due to these rainbow functions, and so the critical behaviour from\nGibbs does not change by this deformation.This is because the deformation in\nthe entropy cancel's out the temperature deformation.\n", "  We use high resolution ARPES to study the resonant, collective excitation\nmode in the superconducting state of Bi2212. By collecting very high quality\ndata we found new features in the self energy in the antinodal region, where\nthe interaction of electrons with the mode is the strongest. This interaction\nleads to pronounced peak in the scattering rate and we demonstrate that this\nfeature is directly responsible for well known hump-dip-peak structure in\ncuprates. By studying how the weight of this peak changes with temperature we\nunequivocally demonstrate that interaction of electrons with resonant mode in\ncuprates vanishes at Tc and is very much localized in the momentum space close\nto the antinode. These findings present a consistent picture of line shape and\nself energy signatures of the electron-boson coupling in cuprates and resolve\nlong standing controversy surrounding this issue. The momentum dependence of\nthe strength of electron-mode interaction enables development of quantitative\ntheory of this phenomenon in cuprates.\n", "  Star-forming galaxies at high redshifts are the ideal targets to probe the\nhypothetical variation of the fine-structure constant alpha over cosmological\ntime scales. We propose a modification of the alkali doublets method which\nallows us to search for variation in alpha combining far infrared and\nsubmillimeter spectroscopic observations. This variation manifests as velocity\noffsets between the observed positions of the fine-structure and\ngross-structure transitions when compared to laboratory wavelengths. Here we\ndescribe our method whose sensitivity limit to the fractional changes in alpha\nis about 5*10^-7. We also demonstrate that current spectral observations of\nhydrogen and [C II] 158 micron lines provide an upper limit on |Delta\nalpha/alpha| < 6*10^-5 at redshifts z = 3.1 and z = 4.7.\n", "  We present the first interferometric detections of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs),\nan enigmatic new class of astrophysical transient. In a 180-day survey of the\nSouthern sky we discovered 3 FRBs at 843 MHz with the UTMOST array, as part of\ncommissioning science during a major ongoing upgrade. The wide field of view of\nUTMOST ($\\approx 9$ deg$^{2}$) is well suited to FRB searches. The primary beam\nis covered by 352 partially overlapping fan-beams, each of which is searched\nfor FRBs in real time with pulse widths in the range 0.655 to 42 ms, and\ndispersion measures $\\leq$2000 pc cm$^{-3}$. Detections of FRBs with the UTMOST\narray places a lower limit on their distances of $\\approx 10^4$ km (limit of\nthe telescope near-field) supporting the case for an astronomical origin.\nRepeating FRBs at UTMOST or an FRB detected simultaneously with the Parkes\nradio telescope and UTMOST, would allow a few arcsec localisation, thereby\nproviding an excellent means of identifying FRB host galaxies, if present. Up\nto 100 hours of follow-up for each FRB has been carried out with the UTMOST,\nwith no repeating bursts seen. From the detected position, we present 3$\\sigma$\nerror ellipses of 15 arcsec x 8.4 deg on the sky for the point of origin for\nthe FRBs. We estimate an all-sky FRB rate at 843 MHz above a fluence $\\cal\nF_\\mathrm{lim}$ of 11 Jy ms of $\\sim 78$ events sky$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$ at the 95\npercent confidence level. The measured rate of FRBs at 843 MHz is of order two\ntimes higher than we had expected, scaling from the FRB rate at the Parkes\nradio telescope, assuming that FRBs have a flat spectral index and a uniform\ndistribution in Euclidean space. We examine how this can be explained by FRBs\nhaving a steeper spectral index and/or a flatter log$N$-log$\\mathcal{F}$\ndistribution than expected for a Euclidean Universe.\n", "  We have followed up the three Y0 dwarfs WISEPA J041022.71+150248.5, WISEPA\nJ173835.53+273258.9 and WISEPC J205628.90+145953.3 using the UKIRT/WFCAM\ntelescope/instruments. We find parallaxes that are more consistent and accurate\nthan previously published values. We estimate absolute magnitudes in\nphotometric pass-bands from $Y$ to $W3$ and find them to be consistent between\nthe three Y0 dwarfs indicating the inherent cosmic absolute magnitude spread of\nthese objects is small. We examine the MKO $J$ magnitudes over the four year\ntime line and find small but significant monotonic variations. Finally we\nestimate physical parameters from a comparison of spectra and parallax to\nequilibrium and non-equilibrium models finding values consistent with solar\nmetallicity, an effective temperature of 450-475\\,K and log~g of 4.0-4.5.\n", "  We study quantum spin systems with quenched Gaussian disorder. We prove that\nthe variance of all physical quantities in a certain class vanishes in the\ninfinite volume limit. We study also replica symmetry breaking phenomena, where\nthe variance of an overlap operator in the other class does not vanish in the\nreplica symmetric Gibbs state. On the other hand, it vanishes in a spontaneous\nreplica symmetry breaking Gibbs state defined by applying an infinitesimal\nreplica symmetry breaking field. We prove also that the finite variance of the\noverlap operator in the replica symmetric Gibbs state implies the existence of\na spontaneous replica symmetry breaking.\n", "  Classical novae occur on the surface of an accreting white dwarf in a binary\nsystem. After ejection of a fraction of the envelope and when the expanding\nshell becomes optically thin to X-rays, a bright source of supersoft X-rays\narises, powered by residual H burning on the surface of the white dwarf. While\nthe general picture of the nova event is well established, the details and\nbalance of accretion and ejection processes in classical novae are still full\nof unknowns. The long-term balance of accreted matter is of special interest\nfor massive accreting white dwarfs, which may be promising supernova Ia\nprogenitor candidates. V5116 Sgr was observed as a bright and variable\nsupersoft X-ray source by XMM-Newton 610~days after outburst. The light curve\nshowed a periodicity consistent with the orbital period. During one third of\nthe orbit the luminosity was a factor of seven brighter than during the other\ntwo thirds of the orbital period. In the present work we aim to disentangle the\nX-ray spectral components of V5116 Sgr and their variability. We present the\nhigh resolution spectra obtained with XMM-Newton RGS and Chandra LETGS/HRC-S in\nMarch and August 2007. The grating spectrum during the periods of high-flux\nshows a typical hot white dwarf atmosphere dominated by absorption lines of N\nVI and N VII. During the low-flux periods, the spectrum is dominated by an\natmosphere with the same temperature as during the high-flux period, but with\nseveral emission features superimposed. Some of the emission lines are well\nmodeled with an optically thin plasma in collisional equilibrium, rich in C and\nN, which also explains some excess in the spectra of the high-flux period. No\nvelocity shifts are observed in the absorption lines, with an upper limit set\nby the spectral resolution of 500 km/s, consistent with the expectation of a\nnon-expanding atmosphere so late in the evolution of the post-nova.\n", "  We study the disk-jet connection in supermassive black holes by investigating\nthe properties of their optical and radio emissions utilizing the SDSS-DR7 and\nthe NVSS catalogs. Our sample contains 7017 radio-loud quasars with detection\nboth at 1.4~GHz and SDSS optical spectrum. Using this radio-loud quasar sample,\nwe investigate the correlation among the jet power ($P_{\\rm jet}$), the\nbolometric disk luminosity ($L_{\\rm disk}$), and the black hole mass ($M_{\\rm\nBH}$) in the standard accretion disk regime. We find that the jet powers\ncorrelate with the bolometric disk luminosities as $\\log P_{\\rm jet} =\n(0.96\\pm0.012)\\log L_{\\rm disk} + (0.79 \\pm 0.55)$. This suggests that the jet\nproduction efficiency of $\\eta_{\\rm jet}\\simeq1.1_{-0.76}^{+2.6}\\times10^{-2}$\nassuming the disk radiative efficiency of $0.1$ implying low black hole spin\nparameters and/or low magnetic flux for radio-loud quasars. But it can be also\ndue to dependence of the efficiency on geometrical thickness of the accretion\nflow which is expected to be small for quasars accreting at the disk Eddington\nratios $0.01 \\lesssim \\lambda \\lesssim 0.3$. This low jet production efficiency\ndoes not significantly increase even if we set the disk radiative efficiency of\n0.3. We also investigate the fundamental plane in our samples among $P_{\\rm\njet}$, $L_{\\rm disk}$, and $M_{\\rm BH}$. We could not find a statistically\nsignificant fundamental plane for radio-loud quasars in the standard accretion\nregime.\n", "  The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) has measured the spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) for several stars of types O, B, A, F, and G. These\nabsolute fluxes from the CALSPEC database are fit with a new spectral grid\ncomputed from the ATLAS-APOGEE ATLAS9 model atmosphere database using a\nchi-square minimization technique in four parameters. The quality of the fits\nare compared for complete LTE grids by Castelli & Kurucz (CK04) and our new\ncomprehensive LTE grid (BOSZ). For the cooler stars, the fits with the MARCS\nLTE grid are also evaluated, while the hottest stars are also fit with the NLTE\nLanz & Hubeny OB star grids. Unfortunately, these NLTE models do not transition\nsmoothly in the infrared to agree with our new BOSZ LTE grid at the NLTE lower\nlimit of Teff =15,000K.\n  The new BOSZ grid is available via the Space Telescope Institute MAST archive\nand has a much finer sampled IR wavelength scale than CK04, which will\nfacilitate the modeling of stars observed by the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST). Our result for the angular diameter of Sirius agrees with the ground-\nbased interferometric value.\n", "  Recent quasar surveys have revealed that supermassive black holes (SMBHs)\nrarely exceed a mass of $M_{\\rm BH} \\sim {\\rm a~few}\\times10^{10}~M_{\\odot}$\nduring the entire cosmic history. It has been argued that quenching of the BH\ngrowth is caused by a transition of a nuclear accretion disk into an advection\ndominated accretion flow, with which strong outflows and/or jets are likely to\nbe associated. We investigate a relation between the maximum mass of SMBHs and\nthe radio-loudness of quasars with a well-defined sample of $\\sim 10^5$ quasars\nat a redshift range of $0<z<2$, obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys DR7\ncatalog. We find that the number fraction of the radio-loud (RL) quasars\nincreases above a threshold of $M_{\\rm BH} \\simeq 10^{9.5}~M_{\\odot}$,\nindependent of their redshifts. Moreover, the number fraction of RL quasars\nwith lower Eddington ratios (out of the whole RL quasars), indicating lower\naccretion rates, increases above the critical BH mass. These observational\ntrends can be natural consequences of the proposed scenario of suppressing BH\ngrowth around the apparent maximum mass of $\\sim 10^{10}~M_{\\odot}$. The\nongoing VLA Sky Survey in radio will allow us to estimate of the exact number\nfraction of RL quasars more precisely, which gives further insights to\nunderstand quenching processes for BH growth.\n", "  We compare the mean mass assembly histories of compact and fossil galaxy\ngroups in the Millennium dark matter simulation and an associated semi-analytic\ngalaxy formation model. Tracing the halo mass of compact groups (CGs) from z=0\nto z=1 shows that, on average, 55 per cent of the halo mass in compact groups\nis assembled since z~1, compared to 40 per cent of the halo mass in fossil\ngroups (FGs) in the same time interval, indicating that compared to FGs, CGs\nare relatively younger galaxy systems. At z=0, for a given halo mass, fossil\ngroups tend to have a larger concentration than compact groups. Investigating\nthe evolution of CG's parameters show that they become more compact with time.\nCGs at z=0.5 see their magnitude gaps increase exponentially, but it takes ~10\nGyr for them to reach a magnitude gap of 2 magnitudes. The slow growth of the\nmagnitude gap leads to only a minority (~41 per cent) of CGs selected at z=0.5\nturning into a FG by z=0. Also, while three-quarters of FGs go through a\ncompact phase, most fail to meet the CG isolation criterion, leaving only ~30\nper cent of FGs fully satisfying the CG selection criteria. Therefore, there is\nno strong link of CGs turning into FGs or FGs originating from CGs. The\nrelation between CGs and FGs is thus more complex, and in most cases, FGs and\nCGs follow different evolutionary tracks.\n", "  We present ALMA observations of the 0.88 millimeter dust continuum, 13CO, and\nC18O J=3-2 line emission of the circumbinary disk HD142527 at a spatial\nresolution of about 0.25\". This system is characterized by a large central\ncavity of roughly 120 AU in radius, and asymmetric dust and gas emission. By\ncomparing the observations with theoretical models, we find that the azimuthal\nvariations in gas and dust density reach a contrast of 54 for dust grains and\n3.75 for CO molecules, with an extreme gas-to-dust ratio of 1.7 on the dust\ncrescent. We point out that caution is required in interpreting continuum\nsubtracted maps of the line emission as this process might result in removing a\nlarge fraction of the line emission. Radially, we find that both the gas and\ndust surface densities can be described by Gaussians, centered at the same disk\nradius, and with gas profiles wider than for the dust. These results strongly\nsupport a scenario in which millimeter dust grains are radially and azimuthally\ntrapped toward the center of a gas pressure bump. Finally, our observations\nreveal a compact source of continuum and CO emission inside the dust depleted\ncavity at about 50 AU from the primary star. The kinematics of the CO emission\nfrom this region is different from that expected from material in Keplerian\nrotation around the binary system, and might instead trace a compact disk\naround a third companion. Higher angular resolution observations are required\nto investigate the nature of this source.\n", "  Dust plays a central role in the unification theory of active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs). Whether the dust that forms the torus around an AGN is\ntenth-$\\mu$m-sized like interstellar grains or much larger has a profound\nimpact on correcting for the obscuration of the dust torus to recover the\nintrinsic spectrum and luminosity of the AGN. Here we show that the ratio of\nthe optical extinction in the visual band ($A_V$) to the optical depth of the\n9.7 $\\mu$m silicate absorption feature ($\\Delta\\tau_{9.7}$) could potentially\nbe an effective probe of the dust size. The anomalously lower ratio of\n$A_V/\\Delta\\tau_{9.7} \\approx 5.5$ of AGNs compared to that of the Galactic\ndiffuse interstellar medium of $A_V/\\Delta\\tau_{9.7} \\approx 18$ reveals that\nthe dust in AGN torus could be substantially larger than the interstellar\ngrains of the Milky Way and of the Small Magellanic Cloud, and therefore, one\nmight expect a flat extinction curve for AGNs.\n", "  In this second paper of the Hawaii SCUBA-2 Lensing Cluster Survey series, we\ncross-match SCUBA-2 maps with 3 and 6 GHz images from the Janksy-VLA Frontier\nFields Legacy Survey for three cluster fields, MACS J0416.1--2403, MACS\nJ0717.5+3745, and MACS J1149.5+2223. Within the HST coverage, 14 out of 44 850\n$\\mu$m sources have 3 GHz counterparts, five of which are also detected at 6\nGHz. The 850 $\\mu$m flux densities of these detected sources span from 0.7 to\n4.4 mJy after correcting for lensing amplification. The median redshift of the\nsample is $z = 1.28^{+0.07}_{-0.09}$, much lower than the typical redshifts ($z\n= 2-3$) of brighter submillimeter galaxies in the literature. In addition, we\nfind that our sources have lower dust temperatures than those of the brighter\nsubmillimeter galaxies. This is also confirmed by an analysis of the ratio\nbetween infrared star formation rate and 850 $\\mu$m flux density. However,\nthese 14 sources may not represent the general submillimeter population at the\nsame flux range, given that the SCUBA-2 sources without radio counterparts are\nlikely at higher redshifts. Detection of these sources would require deeper\nradio images or submillimeter interferometry.\n", "  In the updated APOGEE-Kepler catalog, we have asteroseismic and spectroscopic\ndata for over 3000 first ascent red giants. Given the size and accuracy of this\nsample, these data offer an unprecedented test of the accuracy of stellar\nmodels on the post-main-sequence. When we compare these data to theoretical\npredictions, we find a metallicity dependent temperature offset with a slope of\naround 100 K per dex in metallicity. We find that this effect is present in all\nmodel grids tested and that theoretical uncertainties in the models, correlated\nspectroscopic errors, and shifts in the asteroseismic mass scale are\ninsufficient to explain this effect. Stellar models can be brought into\nagreement with the data if a metallicity dependent convective mixing length is\nused, with $ \\Delta\\alpha_{\\rm ML, YREC} \\sim 0.2$ per dex in metallicity, a\ntrend inconsistent with the predictions of three dimensional stellar convection\nsimulations. If this effect is not taken into account, isochrone ages for red\ngiants from the Gaia data will be off by as much as a factor of 2 even at\nmodest deviations from solar metallicity ([Fe/H]=$-$0.5).\n", "  We discuss the radiative transfer theory for translucent clouds illuminated\nby an extended background source. First we derive a rigorous solution based on\nthe assumption that multiple scattering produce an isotropic flux. Then we\nderive a more manageable analytic approximation showing that it nicely matches\nthe results of the rigorous approach. To validate our model, we compare our\npredictions with accurate laboratory measurements for various types of well\ncharacterized grains, including purely dielectric and strongly absorbing\nmaterials representative of astronomical icy and metallic grains, respectively,\nfinding excellent agreement without the need of adding free parameters. We use\nour model to explore the behavior of an astrophysical cloud illuminated by a\ndiffuse source with dust grains having parameters typical of the classic ISM\ngrains of Draine & Lee (1984) and protoplanetary disks, with an application to\nthe dark silhouette disk 114-426 in Orion Nebula. We find that the scattering\nterm modifies the transmitted radiation, both in terms of intensity\n(extinction) and shape (reddening) of the spectral distribution. In particular,\nfor small optical thickness our results show that scattering makes reddening\nalmost negligible at visible wavelengths. Once the optical thickness increases\nenough and the probability of scattering events become close to or larger than\n1, reddening becomes present but appreciably modified with respect to the\nstandard expression for line-of-sight absorption. Moreover, variations of the\ngrain refractive index, in particular the amount of absorption, also play an\nimportant role changing the shape of the spectral transmission curve, with\ndielectric grain showing the minimum amount of reddening.\n", "  Increasing observational and theoretical evidence points to binary white\ndwarf mergers as the origin of some if not most normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe\nIa). In this paper, we discuss the post-merger evolution of binary white dwarf\n(WD) mergers, and their relevance to the double-degenerate channel of SNe Ia.\nWe present 3D simulations of carbon-oxygen (C/O) WD binary systems undergoing\nunstable mass transfer, varying both the total mass and the mass ratio. We\ndemonstrate that these systems generally give rise to a one-armed gravitational\nspiral instability. The spiral density modes transport mass and angular\nmomentum in the disk even in the absence of a magnetic field, and are most\npronounced for secondary-to-primary mass ratios larger than $0.6$. We further\nanalyze carbon burning in these systems to assess the possibility of\ndetonation. Unlike the case of a $1.1 + 1.0 M_{\\odot}$ C/O WD binary, we find\nthat WD binary systems with lower mass and smaller mass ratios do not detonate\nas SNe Ia up to $\\sim8-22$ outer dynamical times. Two additional models do\nhowever undergo net heating, and their secular increase in temperature could\npossibly result in a detonation on timescales longer than those considered\nhere.\n", "  AA Tau is the archetype for a class of stars with a peculiar periodic\nphotometric variability thought to be related to a warped inner disk structure\nwith a nearly edge-on viewing geometry. We present high resolution ($\\sim$0.2\")\nALMA observations of the 0.87 and 1.3~mm dust continuum emission from the disk\naround AA Tau. These data reveal an evenly spaced three-ringed emission\nstructure, with distinct peaks at 0.34\", 0.66\", and 0.99\", all viewed at a\nmodest inclination of 59.1$^{\\circ}\\pm$0.3$^{\\circ}$ (decidedly not edge-on).\nIn addition to this ringed substructure, we find non-axisymmetric features\nincluding a `bridge' of emission that connects opposite sides of the innermost\nring. We speculate on the nature of this `bridge' in light of accompanying\nobservations of HCO$^+$ and $^{13}$CO (J=3--2) line emission. The HCO$^+$\nemission is bright interior to the innermost dust ring, with a projected\nvelocity field that appears rotated with respect to the resolved disk geometry,\nindicating the presence of a warp or inward radial flow. We suggest that the\ncontinuum bridge and HCO$^+$ line kinematics could originate from gap-crossing\naccretion streams, which may be responsible for the long-duration dimming of\noptical light from AA Tau.\n", "  Jets often occur repeatedly from almost the same location. In this paper, a\ncomplex solar jet was observed with two phases to the west of NOAA AR 11513 on\nJuly 2nd, 2012. If it had been observed at only moderate resolution, the two\nphases and their points of origin would have been regarded as identical.\nHowever, at high resolution we find the two phases merge into one another and\nthe accompanying footpoint brightenings occur at different locations. The\nphases originate from different magnetic patches rather than being one phase\noriginating from the same patch. Photospheric line of sight (LOS) magnetograms\nshow that the bases of the two phases lie in two different patches of magnetic\nflux which decrease in size during the occurrence of the two phases. Based on\nthese observations, we suggest the driving mechanism of the two successive\nphases is magnetic cancellation of two separate magnetic fragments with an\nopposite polarity fragment between them.\n", "  We study the writhe, twist and magnetic helicity of different magnetic flux\nropes, based on models of the solar coronal magnetic field structure. These\ninclude an analytical force-free Titov--D\\'emoulin equilibrium solution, non\nforce-free magnetohydrodynamic simulations, and nonlinear force-free magnetic\nfield models. The geometrical boundary of the magnetic flux rope is determined\nby the quasi-separatrix layer and the bottom surface, and the axis curve of the\nflux rope is determined by its overall orientation. The twist is computed by\nthe Berger--Prior formula that is suitable for arbitrary geometry and both\nforce-free and non-force-free models. The magnetic helicity is estimated by the\ntwist multiplied by the square of the axial magnetic flux. We compare the\nobtained values with those derived by a finite volume helicity estimation\nmethod. We find that the magnetic helicity obtained with the twist method\nagrees with the helicity carried by the purely current-carrying part of the\nfield within uncertainties for most test cases. It is also found that the\ncurrent-carrying part of the model field is relatively significant at the very\nlocation of the magnetic flux rope. This qualitatively explains the agreement\nbetween the magnetic helicity computed by the twist method and the helicity\ncontributed purely by the current-carrying magnetic field.\n", "  In recent years, new high spatial resolution observations of the Sun's\natmosphere have revealed the presence of a plethora of small-scale magnetic\nelements down to the resolution limit of current cohort of solar telescopes\n($\\sim 100-120$ km on the solar photosphere). These small magnetic field\nconcentrations, due to the granular buffeting, can support and guide several\nmagneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) wave modes that would eventually contribute to the\nenergy budget of the upper layers of the atmosphere.\\\\ In this work, exploiting\nthe high spatial and temporal resolution chromospheric data acquired with the\nSwedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST), and applying the empirical mode\ndecomposition (EMD) technique to the tracking of the solar magnetic features,\nwe analyse the perturbations of the horizontal velocity vector of a set of\nchromospheric magnetic elements. We find observational evidence that suggests a\nphase relation between the two components of the velocity vector itself,\nresulting in its helical motion.\n", "  We report the results of ALMA observations of a protoplanetary disk\nsurrounding the Herbig Ae star AB Aurigae. We obtained high-resolution (0.1\";\n14 au) images in $^{12}$CO (J=2-1) emission and in dust continuum at the\nwavelength of 1.3 mm. The continuum emission is detected at the center and at\nthe ring with a radius of $\\sim$ 120 au. The CO emission is dominated by two\nprominent spirals within the dust ring. These spirals are trailing and appear\nto be about 4 times brighter than their surrounding medium. Their kinematics is\nconsistent with Keplerian rotation at an inclination of 23 degree. The apparent\ntwo-arm-spiral pattern is best explained by tidal disturbances created by an\nunseen companion located at 60--80 au, with dust confined in the pressure bumps\ncreated outside this companion orbit. An additional companion at r of 30 au,\ncoinciding with the peak CO brightness and a large pitch angle of the spiral,\nwould help to explain the overall emptiness of the cavity. Alternative\nmechanisms to excite the spirals are discussed. The origin of the large pitch\nangle detected here remain puzzling.\n", "  We calculated the optical conductivity $\\sigma(T,\\Omega)$ of a gas of\nBogoliubov quasiparticles (BQP) from their Green's function and the Kubo\nformula. We compare with corresponding normal state (N) and superconducting\nstate (SC) results. The superconducting case includes the dynamic response of\nthe condensate through additional contributions to the Kubo formula involving\nthe Gor'kov anomalous Green's function. The differences in the optical\nscattering rate are largest just above the optical gap and become progressively\nsmaller as the photon energy is increased or the temperature is raised. Our\nresults are compared with those obtained using a recently advocated\nphenomenological procedure for eliminating the effect of the condensate [1].\nThe $\\delta$-function contribution at zero photon energy, proportional to the\nsuperfluid density, is dropped in the real part of the conductivity\n$[\\sigma_1(T,\\Omega)]$ and its Kramers-Kronig transform is subtracted from the\nimaginary part $\\sigma_2(T,\\Omega)$. This results in deviations from our BQP\nand superconducting state optical scattering rates even in the region where\nthese have merged and are, in addition, close to the normal state result.\n", "  We investigate the star forming activity of a sample of infrared (IR)-bright\ndust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) that show an extreme red color in the optical and\nIR regime, $(i - [22])_{\\rm AB} > 7.0$. Combining an IR-bright DOG sample with\nthe flux at 22 $\\mu$m $>$ 3.8 mJy discovered by Toba & Nagao (2016) with IRAS\nfaint source catalog version 2 and AKARI far-IR (FIR) all-sky survey bright\nsource catalog version 2, we selected 109 DOGs with FIR data. For a subsample\nof 7 IR-bright DOGs with spectroscopic redshift ($0.07 < z < 1.0$) that was\nobtained from literature, we estimated their IR luminosity, star formation rate\n(SFR), and stellar mass based on the spectral energy distribution fitting. We\nfound that (i) WISE 22 $\\mu$m luminosity at observed frame is a good indicator\nof IR luminosity for IR-bright DOGs and (ii) the contribution of active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN) to IR luminosity increases with IR luminosity. By\ncomparing the stellar mass and SFR relation for our DOG sample and literature,\nwe found that most of IR-bright DOGs lie significantly above the main sequence\nof star-forming galaxies at similar redshift, indicating that the majority of\nIRAS- and/or AKARI-detected IR-bright DOGs are starburst galaxies.\n", "  Tidal encounters are believed to be one of the key drivers of galactic spiral\nstructure in the Universe. Such spirals are expected to produce different\nmorphological and kinematic features compared to density wave and dynamic\nspiral arms. In this work we present high resolution simulations of a tidal\nencounter of a small mass companion with a disc galaxy. Included are the\neffects of gas cooling and heating, star formation and stellar feedback. The\nstructure of the perturbed disc differs greatly from the isolated galaxy,\nshowing clear spiral features that act as sites of new star formation, and\ndisplaying interarm spurs. The two arms of the galaxy, the bridge and tail,\nappear to behave differently; with different star formation histories and\nstructure. Specific attention is focused on offsets between gas and stellar\nspiral features which can be directly compared to observations. We find some\noffsets do exist between different media, with gaseous arms appearing mostly on\nthe convex side of the stellar arms, though the exact locations appear highly\ntime dependent. These results further highlight the differences between tidal\nspirals and other theories of arm structure.\n", "  We present experimental and numerical results for the long-range fluctuation\nproperties in the spectra of quantum graphs with chaotic classical dynamics and\npreserved time-reversal invariance. Such systems are generally believed to\nprovide an ideal basis for the experimental study of prob- lems originating\nfrom the field of quantum chaos and random matrix theory. Our objective is to\ndemonstrate that this is true only for short-range fluctuation properties in\nthe spectra, whereas the observation of deviations in the long-range\nfluctuations is typical for quantum graphs. This may be attributed to the\nunavoidable occurrence of short periodic orbits, which explore only the\nindividual bonds forming a graph and thus do not sense the chaoticity of its\ndynamics. In order to corrobo- rate our supposition, we performed numerous\nexperimental and corresponding numerical studies of long-range fluctuations in\nterms of the number variance and the power spectrum. Furthermore, we evaluated\nlength spectra and compared them to semiclassical ones obtained from the exact\ntrace formula for quantum graphs.\n", "  We theoretically investigate an ultrastrongly-coupled micromaser based on\nRydberg atoms interacting with a superconducting LC resonator, where the common\nrotating-wave approximation and slowly-varying-envelope approximation are no\nlonger applicable. The effect of counter-rotating terms on the masing dynamics\nis studied in detail. We find that the intraresonator electric energy declines\nand the microwave oscillation frequency shifts significantly in the regime of\nultrastrong coupling. Additionally, the micromaser phase fluctuation is\nsuppressed, resulting in a reduced spectral linewidth.\n", "  In early 2014 the fast-moving near-infrared source G2 reached its closest\napproach to the supermassive black hole Sgr A* in the Galactic Center. We\nreport on the evolution of the ionized gaseous component and the dusty\ncomponent of G2 immediately after this event, revealed by new observations\nobtained in 2015 and 2016 with the SINFONI integral field spectrograph and the\nNACO imager at the ESO VLT. The spatially resolved dynamics of the Br$\\gamma$\nline emission can be accounted for by the ballistic motion and tidal shearing\nof a test-particle cloud that has followed a highly eccentric Keplerian orbit\naround the black hole for the last 12 years. The non-detection of a drag force\nor any strong hydrodynamic interaction with the hot gas in the inner accretion\nzone limits the ambient density to less than a few 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$ at the\ndistance of closest approach (1500 $R_s$), assuming G2 is a spherical cloud\nmoving through a stationary and homogeneous atmosphere. The dust continuum\nemission is unresolved in L'-band, but stays consistent with the location of\nthe Br$\\gamma$ emission. The total luminosity of the Br$\\gamma$ and L' emission\nhas remained constant to within the measurement uncertainty. The nature and\norigin of G2 are likely related to that of the precursor source G1, since their\norbital evolution is similar, though not identical. Both object are also likely\nrelated to a trailing tail structure, which is continuously connected to G2\nover a large range in position and radial velocity.\n", "  Analysis of the band structure of TiS$_3$ single-layers suggests the\npossibility of changing their physical behaviour by injecting electron\ncarriers. The anisotropy of the valence and conduction bands is explained in\nterms of their complex orbital composition. The nature of the Fermi surface and\nLindhard response function for different doping concentrations is studied by\nmeans of first-principles DFT calculations. It is suggested that for electron\ndoping levels $x$ (number of electrons per unit cell) $\\sim$ 0.18-0.30$e^-$ the\nsystem could exhibit incommensurate charge or spin modulations which, however,\nwould keep the metallic state whereas systems doped with smaller $x$ would be\n2D metals without any electronic instability. The effect of spin-orbit coupling\nin the band dispersion is analysed. The DFT effective masses are used to study\nthe plasmon spectrum from an effective low energy model. We find that this\nmaterial supports highly anisotropic plasmons, with opposite anisotropy for the\nelectron and hole bands.\n", "  We report $^{153}$Eu, $^{75}$As and $^{59}$Co nuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR) results on EuCo$_2$As$_2$ single crystal. Observations of $^{153}$Eu and\n$^{75}$As NMR spectra in zero magnetic field at 4.3 K below an\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering temperature $T_{\\rm N}$ = 45 K and its\nexternal magnetic field dependence clearly evidence an incommensurate helical\nAFM structure in EuCo$_2$As$_2$. Furthermore, based on $^{59}$Co NMR data in\nboth the paramagnetic and the incommensurate AFM states, we have determined the\nmodel-independent value of the AFM propagation vector ${\\bf k}$ = (0, 0, 0.73\n$\\pm$ 0.07)2$\\pi$/$c$ where $c$ is the $c$ lattice parameter. Thus the\nincommensurate helical AFM state was characterized by only NMR data with\nmodel-independent analyses, showing NMR to be a unique tool for determination\nof the spin structure in incommensurate helical AFMs.\n", "  We have modified the iterative procedure introduced by Lin et al. (2016), to\nsystematically combine the submm images taken from ground based (e.g., CSO,\nJCMT, APEX) and space (e.g., Herschel, Planck) telescopes. We applied the\nupdated procedure to observations of three well studied Infrared Dark Clouds\n(IRDCs): G11.11-0.12, G14.225-0.506 and G28.34+0.06, and then performed\nsingle-component, modified black-body fits to derive $\\sim$10$\"$ resolution\ndust temperature and column density maps. The derived column density maps show\nthat these three IRDCs exhibit complex filamentary structures embedding with\nrich clumps/cores. We compared the column density probability distribution\nfunctions (N-PDFs) and two-point correlation (2PT) functions of the column\ndensity field between these IRDCs with several OB cluster-forming regions.\nBased on the observed correlation and measurements, and complementary\nhydrodynamical simulations for a 10$^{4}$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ molecular cloud, we\nhypothesize that cloud evolution can be better characterized by the evolution\nof the (column) density distribution function and the relative power of dense\nstructures as a function of spatial scales, rather than merely based on the\npresence of star-forming activity. Based on the small analyzed sample, we\npropose four evolutionary stages, namely: {\\it cloud integration, stellar\nassembly, cloud pre-dispersal and dispersed-cloud.} The initial {\\it cloud\nintegration} stage and the final {\\it dispersed cloud} stage may be\ndistinguished from the two intermediate stages by a steeper than $-$4 power-law\nindex of the N-PDF. The {\\it cloud integration} stage and the subsequent {\\it\nstellar assembly} stage are further distinguished from each other by the larger\nluminosity-to-mass ratio ($>$40 $\\rm L_{\\odot}/M_{\\odot}$) of the latter.\n", "  We present ALMA $^{12}$CO (J=1-0, 3-2 and 6-5), $^{13}$CO (J=1-0) and\nC$^{18}$O (J=1-0) observations of the local Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy,\nIRAS 13120-5453 (dubbed \"The Yo-yo\"). The morphologies of the three isotopic\nspecies differ, where $^{13}$CO shows a hole in emission towards the center. We\nmeasure integrated brightness temperature line ratios of $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO\n$\\geq$ 60 (exceeding 200) and $^{13}$CO/C$^{18}$O $\\leq$ 1 in the central\nregion. Assuming optical thin emission, C$^{18}$O is more abundant than\n$^{13}$CO in several regions. The abundances within the central 500 pc are\nconsistent with enrichment of the ISM via a young starburst ($<$7Myr), a\ntop-heavy initial mass function or a combination of both.\n", "  K$_2$CuF$_4$ is magnetically described as a spin-1/2, quasi-two-dimensional\n(2D), square-lattice XXZ ferromagnet with weak easy-plane anisotropy. The\nmagnetic ordering for an applied magnetic field $H$ parallel to the $c$ axis is\nequivalent to the Bose\\,--\\,Einstein condensation (BEC) of lattice bosons, as\ndiscussed by Matsubara and Matsuda [Prog. Theor. Phys. \\textbf{16}, 569\n(1956)]. Magnetization and specific heat measurements were performed to obtain\nthe temperature vs magnetic field phase diagram for $H\\,{\\parallel}\\,c$. The\nphase boundary between polarized and ordered phases was found to be expressed\nby the power law $H_{\\rm c}(T)\\,{-}\\,H_{\\rm c}(0)\\,{\\propto}\\,T^\\phi$ with\nexponent $\\phi\\,{\\approx}\\,1.0$ in a wide temperature range, in agreement with\nthe theory of quasi-2D BEC.\n", "  Lagrangian acceleration statistics in a fully developed turbulent channel\nflow at $Re_\\tau = 1440$ are investigated, based on tracer particle tracking in\nexperiments and direct numerical simulations. The evolution with wall distance\nof the Lagrangian velocity and acceleration time scales is analyzed. Dependency\nbetween acceleration components in the near-wall region is described using\ncross-correlations and joint probability density functions. The strong\nstreamwise coherent vortices typical of wall-bounded turbulent flows are shown\nto have a significant impact on the dynamics. This results in a strong\nanisotropy at small scales in the near-wall region that remains present in most\nof the channel. Such statistical properties may be used as constraints in\nbuilding advanced Lagrangian stochastic models to predict the dispersion and\nmixing of chemical components for combustion or environmental studies.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the characteristics of the nonlinear\nspin-orbital angular momentum coupling induced by second-harmonic generation in\nplasmonic and dielectric nanostructures made of centrosymmetric materials. In\nparticular, the connection between the phase singularities and polarization\nhelicities in the longitudinal components of the fundamental and\nsecond-harmonic optical fields and the scatterer symmetry properties are\ndiscussed. By in-depth comparison between the interaction of structured optical\nbeams with plasmonic and dielectric nanostructures, we have found that\nall-dielectric and plasmonic nanostructures that exhibit magnetic and electric\nresonances have comparable second-harmonic conversion efficiency. In addition,\nmechanisms for second-harmonic enhancement for single and chiral clusters of\nscatterers are unveiled and the relationships between the content of optical\nangular momentum of the incident optical beams and the enhancement of nonlinear\nlight scattering is discussed. In particular, we formulate a general angular\nmomenta conservation law for the nonlinear spin-orbital angular momentum\ninteraction, which includes the quasi-angular-momentum of chiral structures\nwith different-order rotational symmetry. As a key conclusion of our study\nrelevant to nanophotonics, we argue that all-dielectric nanostructures provide\na more suitable platform to investigate experimentally the nonlinear\ninteraction between spin and orbital angular momenta, as compared to plasmonic\nones, chiefly due to their narrower resonance peaks, lower intrinsic losses,\nand higher sustainable optical power.\n", "  We present a statistical study on the [C I]($^{3} \\rm P_{1} \\rightarrow {\\rm\n^3 P}_{0}$), [C I] ($^{3} \\rm P_{2} \\rightarrow {\\rm ^3 P}_{1}$) lines\n(hereafter [C I] (1$-$0) and [C I] (2$-$1), respectively) and the CO (1$-$0)\nline for a sample of (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies [(U)LIRGs]. We explore\nthe correlations between the luminosities of CO (1$-$0) and [C I] lines, and\nfind that $L'_\\mathrm{CO(1-0)}$ correlates almost linearly with both $L'_\n\\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}$ and $L'_\\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}$, suggesting that [C I] lines\ncan trace total molecular gas mass at least for (U)LIRGs. We also investigate\nthe dependence of $L'_\\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}$/$L'_\\mathrm{CO(1-0)}$,\n$L'_\\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}$/$L'_\\mathrm{CO(1-0)}$ and\n$L'_\\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}$/$L'_\\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}$ on the far-infrared color of\n60-to-100 $\\mu$m, and find non-correlation, a weak correlation and a modest\ncorrelation, respectively. Under the assumption that these two carbon\ntransitions are optically thin, we further calculate the [C I] line excitation\ntemperatures, atomic carbon masses, and the mean [C I] line flux-to-H$_2$ mass\nconversion factors for our sample. The resulting $\\mathrm{H_2}$ masses using\nthese [C I]-based conversion factors roughly agree with those derived from\n$L'_\\mathrm{CO(1-0)}$ and CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor.\n", "  We present the highest spatial resolution ALMA observations to date of the\nClass I protostar WL 17 in the $\\rho$ Ophiuchus L1688 molecular cloud complex,\nwhich show that it has a 12 AU hole in the center of its disk. We consider\nwhether WL 17 is actually a Class II disk being extincted by foreground\nmaterial, but find that such models do not provide a good fit to the broadband\nSED and also require such high extinction that it would presumably arise from\ndense material close to the source such as a remnant envelope. Self-consistent\nmodels of a disk embedded in a rotating collapsing envelope can nicely\nreproduce both the ALMA 3 mm observations and the broadband SED of WL 17. This\nsuggests that WL 17 is a disk in the early stages of its formation, and yet\neven at this young age the inner disk has been depleted. Although there are\nmultiple pathways for such a hole to be created in a disk, if this hole were\nproduced by the formation of planets it could place constraints on the\ntimescale for the growth of planetesimals in protoplanetary disks.\n", "  It is rare for an $S$-wave resonance to remain narrow while approaching\nthreshold as a result of the interaction parameters being fine tuned. Such an\ninteraction is, however, realized by pion-charmed baryon system $\\pi \\Sigma_c$,\nwhich has a narrow resonance $\\Lambda_c^+(2595)$ located a few MeVs above its\nthreshold. We study the consequence of narrowly resonant inter-species\ninteraction in a three-body system composed of two identical light bosons and\nan extremely heavy particle. We concern ourselves in the present paper with\nresonances of the three-body system, as opposed to bound states. The focus is\non the technical aspects of constructing the integral equation for three-body\namplitudes and of analytically continuing the integral equation to locate the\n\"trimer\" resonance pole in the unphysical sheet of the center-of-mass energy\nplane.\n", "  Materials exhibiting large magnetoresistance may not only be of fundamental\nresearch interest, but also can lead to wide-ranging applications in magnetic\nsensors and switches. Here we demonstrate a large linear-in-field\nmagnetoresistance, $\\Delta \\rho/\\rho$ reaching as high as $\\sim$600$\\%$ at 2 K\nunder a 9 Tesla field, in the tetragonal phase of a transiton-metal stannide\n$\\beta$-RhSn$_4$. Detailed analyses show that its magnetic responses are\noverall inconsistent with the classical model based on the multiple electron\nscattering by mobility fluctuations in an inhomogenous conductor, but rather in\nline with the quantum effects due to the presence of Dirac-like dispersions in\nthe electronic structure. Our results may help guiding the future quest for\nquantum magnetoresistive materials into the family of stannides, similar to the\nrole played by PtSn$_4$ with topological node arcs.\n", "  In loop quantum cosmology, polymer quantization is applied to gravity and\nSchrodinger quantization to matter. This approach misses interesting\ncosmological dynamics coming from the polymer quantization of matter. We\ndemonstrate this in semiclassical cosmology with a scalar field and\npressureless dust: gravity is kept classical, dust is used to fix the time\ngauge, and polymer quantization effects are isolated in the scalar field. The\nresulting dynamics shows a period of inflation, both with and without a scalar\npotential, and the emergence of a classical universe at late times. Since\ngravity is not quantized, the cosmological singularity is not resolved, but our\nresults suggest that polymer quantization of both gravity and matter are\nimportant for a complete picture.\n", "  We solve the Dirac radial equation for a nucleon in a scalar Woods-Saxon\npotential well of depth $V_0$ and radius $r_0$. A sequence of values for the\ndepth and radius are considered. For shallow potentials with $-1000 MeV\\lesssim\nV_0 < 0$ the wave functions for the positive-energy states $\\Psi _+(r)$ are\ndominated by their nucleon component $g(r)$. But for deeper potentials with\n$V_0 \\lesssim -1500 MeV $ the $\\Psi_+(r)$s begin to have dominant anti-nucleon\ncomponent $f(r)$. In particular, a special intruder state enters with wave\nfunction $\\Psi_{1/2}(r)$ and energy $E_{1/2}$. We have considered several $r_0$\nvalues between 2 and 8 fm. For $V_0 \\lesssim -2000 MeV$ and the above $r_0$\nvalues, $\\Psi _{1/2}$ is the only bound positive-energy state and has its\n$g(r)$ closely equal to $-f(r)$, both having a narrow wave-packet shape\ncentered around $r_0$. The $E_{1/2}$ of this state is practically independent\nof $V_0$ for the above $V_0$ range and obeys closely the relation\n$E_{1/2}=\\frac{\\hbar c}{r_0}$.\n", "  We present Herschel spectroscopy of atomic lines arising in photodissociation\nregions as well as ionization regions of nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs),\nfocusing on the volume-limited Atlas3D sample. Our data include the [CII],\n[OI], and [NII] 122 and 205 micron lines, along with ancillary data including\nCO and HI maps. We find ETGs have [CII]/FIR ratios slightly lower than spiral\ngalaxies in the KINGFISH sample, and several ETGs have unusually large [NII]\n122/[CII] ratios. The [NII] 122/[CII] ratio is correlated with UV colors and\nthere is a strong anti-correlation of [CII]/FIR with NUV-K seen in both spirals\nand ETGs, likely due to a softer radiation field with fewer photons available\nto ionize carbon and heat the gas. The correlation thus makes a [CII] deficit\nin galaxies with redder stellar populations. The high [NII] 122/[CII] (and low\n[CII]/FIR) line ratios could also be affected by the removal of much of the\ndiffuse, low density gas, which is consistent with the low HI/H2 ratios. [CII]\nis now being used as a star formation indicator, and we find it is just as good\nfor ETGs as in spirals. The [CII]/CO ratios found are also similar to those\nfound in spiral galaxies. Through use of the [NII] 205 micron line, estimates\nof the percentage of [CII] emission arising from ionized gas indicate a\nsignificant portion could arise in ionized regions.\n", "  Most old globular clusters (GCs) in the Galaxy are observed to have internal\nchemical abundance spreads in light elements. We discuss a new GC formation\nscenario based on hierarchical star formation within fractal molecular clouds.\nIn the new scenario, a cluster of bound and unbound star clusters (`star\ncluster complex', SCC) that have a power-law cluster mass function with a slope\n(beta) of 2 is first formed from a massive gas clump developed in a dwarf\ngalaxy. Such cluster complexes and beta=2 are observed and expected from\nhierarchical star formation. The most massive star cluster (`main cluster'),\nwhich is the progenitor of a GC, can accrete gas ejected from asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) stars initially in the cluster and other low-mass clusters before\nthe clusters are tidally stripped or destroyed to become field stars in the\ndwarf. The SCC is initially embedded in a giant gas hole created by numerous\nsupernovae of the SCC so that cold gas outside the hole can be accreted onto\nthe main cluster later. New stars formed from the accreted gas have chemical\nabundances that are different from those of the original SCC. Using\nhydrodynamical simulations of GC formation based on this scenario, we show that\nthe main cluster with the initial mass as large as [2-5]x10^5 Msun can accrete\nmore than 10^5 Msun gas from AGB stars of the SCC. We suggest that merging of\nhierarchical star cluster complexes can play key roles in stellar halo\nformation around GCs and self-enrichment processes of GCs.\n", "  We study existence, uniqueness and regularity of solutions for linear\nequations in infinitely many derivatives. We develop a natural framework based\non Laplace transform as a correspondence between appropriate $L^p$ and Hardy\nspaces: this point of view allows us to interpret rigorously operators of the\nform $f(\\partial_t)$ where $f$ is an analytic function such as (the analytic\ncontinuation of) the Riemann zeta function. We find the most general solution\nto the equation \\begin{equation*} f(\\partial_t) \\phi = J(t) \\; , \\; \\; \\; t\n\\geq 0 \\; , \\end{equation*} in a convenient class of functions, we define and\nsolve its corresponding initial value problem, and we state conditions under\nwhich the solution is of class $C^k,\\, k \\geq 0$. More specifically, we prove\nthat if some a priori information is specified, then the initial value problem\nis well-posed and it can be solved using only a {\\em finite number} of local\ninitial data. Also, motivated by some intriguing work by Dragovich and\nAref'eva-Volovich on cosmology, we solve explicitly field equations of the form\n\\begin{equation*} \\zeta(\\partial_t + h) \\phi = J(t) \\; , \\; \\; \\; t \\geq 0 \\; ,\n\\end{equation*} in which $\\zeta$ is the Riemann zeta function and $h > 1$.\nFinally, we remark that the $L^2$ case of our general theory allows us to give\na precise meaning to the often-used interpretation of $f(\\partial_t)$ as an\noperator defined by a power series in the differential operator $\\partial_t$.\n", "  We produce two strings of quantum random numbers simultaneously from the\nintensity fluctuations of the twin beams generated by a nondegenerate optical\nparametric oscillator. Two strings of quantum random numbers with bit rates up\nto 60 Mb/s are extracted simultaneously with a suitable post-processing\nalgorithm. By post-selecting the identical data from two raw sequences and\nusing a suitable hash function, we also extract two strings of identical\nquantum random numbers. The obtained random numbers pass all NIST randomness\ntests. The presented scheme shows the feasibility of generating quantum random\nnumbers from the intensity of a macroscopic optical field.\n", "  Astrometric microlensing will offer in the next future a new channel for\ninvestigating the nature of both lenses and sources involved in a gravitational\nmicrolensing event. The effect, corresponding to the shift of the position of\nthe multiple image centroid with respect to the source star location, is\nexpected to occurr on scales from micro-arcoseconds to milli-arcoseconds\ndepending on the characteristics of the lens-source system. Here, we consider\ndifferent classes of events (single/binary lens acting on a single/binary\nsource) also accounting for additional effects including the finite source\nsize, the blending and orbital motion. This is particularly important in the\nera of Gaia observations which is making possible astrometric measurements with\nunprecedent quality.\n", "  We show that the dual partition function of the pure $\\mathcal N=2$ $SU(2)$\ngauge theory in the self-dual $\\Omega$-background (a) is given by Fredholm\ndeterminant of a generalized Bessel kernel and (b) coincides with the tau\nfunction associated to the general solution of the Painlev\\'e III equation of\ntype $D_8$ (radial sine-Gordon equation). In particular, the principal minor\nexpansion of the Fredholm determinant yields Nekrasov combinatorial sums over\npairs of Young diagrams.\n", "  The criticism of the experiment showing discontinuous traces of photons\npassing through a nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer is shown to be unfounded.\n", "  Here we deconstruct, and then in a reasoned way reconstruct, the concept of\n\"entropy of a system,\" paying particular attention to where the randomness may\nbe coming from. We start with the core concept of entropy as a COUNT associated\nwith a DESCRIPTION; this count (traditionally expressed in logarithmic form for\na number of good reasons) is in essence the number of possibilities---specific\ninstances or \"scenarios,\" that MATCH that description. Very natural (and\nvirtually inescapable) generalizations of the idea of description are the\nprobability distribution and of its quantum mechanical counterpart, the density\noperator.\n  We track the process of dynamically updating entropy as a system evolves.\nThree factors may cause entropy to change: (1) the system's INTERNAL DYNAMICS;\n(2) unsolicited EXTERNAL INFLUENCES on it; and (3) the approximations one has\nto make when one tries to predict the system's future state. The latter task is\nusually hampered by hard-to-quantify aspects of the original description,\nlimited data storage and processing resource, and possibly algorithmic\ninadequacy. Factors 2 and 3 introduce randomness into one's predictions and\naccordingly degrade them. When forecasting, as long as the entropy bookkeping\nis conducted in an HONEST fashion, this degradation will ALWAYS lead to an\nentropy increase.\n  To clarify the above point we introduce the notion of HONEST ENTROPY, which\ncoalesces much of what is of course already done, often tacitly, in responsible\nentropy-bookkeping practice. This notion, we believe, will help to fill an\nexpressivity gap in scientific discourse. With its help we shall prove that ANY\ndynamical system---not just our physical universe---strictly obeys Clausius's\noriginal formulation of the second law of thermodynamics IF AND ONLY IF it is\ninvertible. Thus this law is a TAUTOLOGICAL PROPERTY of invertible systems!\n", "  We report here low temperature magnetization isotherms for the single\nmolecule magnet, $(UO_2-L)_3$. By analyzing the low temperature magnetization\nin terms of $M= X_1*B + X_3*B^3$ we extract the linear susceptibility $X_1$ and\nthe leading order nonlinear susceptibility $X_3$. We find that $X_1$ exhibits a\npeak at a temperature of $T_1=10.4 K$ with $Chi_3$ also exhibiting a peak but\nat a reduced temperature $T3 = 5 K$. At the lowest temperatures the isotherms\nexhibit a critical field $B_c = 11.5 T$ marked by a clear point of inflection.\nA minimal Hamiltonian employing S=1 (pseudo) spins with only a single energy\nscale (successfully used to model the behavior of bulk f-electron metamagnets)\nis shown to provide a good description of the observed linear scaling between\n$T_1, T_3$ and $B_c$. We further show that a Heisenberg Hamiltonian previously\nemployed by Carretta et al. (2013 J. Phys.Cond. Matt. 25 486001) to model this\nsingle molecule magnet gives formulas for the angle averaged susceptibilities\n(in the Ising limit) very similar to those of the minimal model.\n", "  Most recent exciting experimental advances introduced buckled and flat\nborophene nanomembranes as new members to the advancing family of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) materials. Borophene, is the boron atom analogue of\ngraphene with interesting properties suitable for a wide variety of\napplications. In this investigation, we conducted extensive first-principles\ndensity functional theory simulations to explore the application of four\ndifferent flat borophene films as anode materials for Al, Mg, Na or Li-ion\nbatteries. In our modelling, first the strongest binding sites were predicted\nand next we gradually increased the adatoms coverage until the maximum capacity\nwas reached. Bader charge analysis was employed to evaluate the charge transfer\nbetween the adatoms and the borophene films. Nudged elastic band method was\nalso utilized to probe the ions diffusions. We calculated the average atom\nadsorption energies and open-circuit voltage profiles as a function of adatoms\ncoverage. Our findings propose the flat borophene films as electrically\nconductive and thermally stable anode materials with ultra high capacities of\n2480 mAh/g, 1640 mAh/g and 2040 mAh/g for Mg, Na or Li-ion batteries,\nrespectively, which distinctly outperform not only the buckled borophene but\nalso all other 2D materials. Our study may provide useful viewpoint with\nrespect to the possible application of flat borophene films for the design of\nhigh capacity and light weight advanced rechargeable ion batteries.\n", "  Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) represent an important milestone for\neffective generative models, which has inspired numerous variants seemingly\ndifferent from each other. One of the main contributions of this paper is to\nreveal a unified geometric structure in GAN and its variants. Specifically, we\nshow that the adversarial generative model training can be decomposed into\nthree geometric steps: separating hyperplane search, discriminator parameter\nupdate away from the separating hyperplane, and the generator update along the\nnormal vector direction of the separating hyperplane. This geometric intuition\nreveals the limitations of the existing approaches and leads us to propose a\nnew formulation called geometric GAN using SVM separating hyperplane that\nmaximizes the margin. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometric GAN\nconverges to a Nash equilibrium between the discriminator and generator. In\naddition, extensive numerical results show that the superior performance of\ngeometric GAN.\n", "  We prove that the bound-state momentum-space wave function $\\phi(p)$ for the\nquasi-one-dimensional hydrogen atom as used by Olendski in two recent\npublications (Eur. J. Phys.38, 038001(2017), arXiv : 1703.10042v1, 26 Mar2017)\nis incorrect. Further, we reconfirm that the wave function used by us in Eur.\nJ.. Phys. 38, 025103 is correct.\n", "  Using heuristic arguments alone, based on the properties of the\nwavefunctions, we obtain the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding\neigenfunctions of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. This approach is\nconsiderably simpler and is perhaps more intuitive than the traditional methods\nof solving a differential equation and manipulating operators.\n", "  We discuss the consequences of violating the no-hair theorem on magnetic\nfields surrounding a black hole. This is achieved by parametrically deforming\nthe Kerr spacetime and studying the effects of such deformations on\nasymptotically uniform magnetic fields around the black hole. We compute the\ndeformed electromagnetic field for slow spins and small deformation parameter,\nand show that the correction is of order the deformation parameter and mimics\nthe angular structure of a quadrupole.\n", "  In this work, we explore graph partitioning (GP) using quantum annealing on\nthe D-Wave 2X machine. Motivated by a recently proposed graph-based electronic\nstructure theory applied to quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) simulations, graph\npartitioning is used for reducing the calculation of the density matrix into\nsmaller subsystems rendering the calculation more computationally efficient.\nUnconstrained graph partitioning as community clustering based on the\nmodularity metric can be naturally mapped into the Hamiltonian of the quantum\nannealer. On the other hand, when constraints are imposed for partitioning into\nequal parts and minimizing the number of cut edges between parts, a quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) reformulation is required. This\nreformulation may employ the graph complement to fit the problem in the Chimera\ngraph of the quantum annealer. Partitioning into 2 parts, 2^N parts\nrecursively, and k parts concurrently are demonstrated with benchmark graphs,\nrandom graphs, and small material system density matrix based graphs. Results\nfor graph partitioning using quantum and hybrid classical-quantum approaches\nare shown to equal or out-perform current \"state of the art\" methods.\n", "  This study aims to advance hardware-level computations for travel-time\ntomography applications in which the wavelength is close to the diameter of the\ninformation that has to be recovered. Such can be the case, for example, in the\nimaging applications of (1) biomedical physics, (2) astro-geophysics and (3)\ncivil engineering. Our aim is to shed light on the effect of that preprocessing\nthe digital waveform signal has on the inversion results and to find\ncomputational solutions that guarantee robust inversion when there are\nincomplete and/or noisy measurements. We describe a hardware-level\nimplementation for integrated and thresholded travel-time computation (ITT and\nTTT). We compare the ITT and TTT approaches in inversion analysis with\nexperimental acoustic travel-time data recorded using a ring geometry for the\ntransmission and measurement points. The results obtained suggest that ITT is\nessential for maintaining the robustness of the inversion with imperfect signal\ndigitization and sparsity. In order to ensure the relevance of the results, the\nspecifications of the test setup were related to those of applications (1)-(3).\n", "  Classical field theories together with the Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches\nto continuum mechanics are embraced under a geometric setting of a fiber\nbundle. The base manifold can be either the body manifold of continuum\nmechanics, space manifold, or space-time. Differentiable sections of the fiber\nbundle represent configurations of the system and the configuration space\ncontaining them is given the structure of an infinite dimensional manifold.\nElements of the cotangent bundle of the configuration space are interpreted as\ngeneralized forces and a representation theorem implies that there exist a\nstress object representing forces, non-uniquely. The properties of stresses are\nstudies as well as the role of constitutive relations in the present general\nsetting.\n", "  The weak lensing of cosmic web filaments is investigated in modified gravity\n(MOG) and it is demonstrated that the detected galaxies and baryonic gas of\norder $5-15 \\%$ in filaments can with the enhanced value of the strength of\ngravity agree with the lensing data for filaments without dark matter.\n", "  We investigate magnetic anisotropy and magnetization reversal mechanism in\nchromium telluride thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We report\nexistence of strong perpendicular anisotropy in these thin films, along with a\nrelatively strong second order anisotropy contribution. The angular variation\nof the switching field observed from the magnetoresistance measurement is\nexplained quantitatively using a one-dimensional defect model. The model\nreveals the relative roles of nucleation and pinning in the magnetization\nreversal, depending on the applied field orientation. Micromagnetic simulations\nare performed to visualize the domain structure and switching process.\n", "  In games of friendship links and behaviors, I propose $k$-player Nash\nstability---a family of equilibria, indexed by a measure of robustness given by\nthe number of permitted link changes, which is (ordinally and cardinally)\nranked in a probabilistic sense. Application of the proposed framework to\nadolescents' tobacco smoking and friendship decisions suggests that: (a.)\nfriendship networks respond to increases of tobacco prices and this response\namplifies the intended policy effect on smoking, (b.) racially desegregating\nhigh-schools, via stimulating the social interactions of students with\ndifferent intrinsic propensity to smoke, decreases the overall smoking\nprevalence, (c.) adolescents are averse to sharing friends so that there is a\nrivalry for friendships, (d.) when data on individuals' friendship network is\nnot available, the importance of price centered policy tools is underestimated.\n", "  In intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide $Fe_xTaS_2$ (0.2 $\\leq$ x\n$\\leq$ 0.4) single crystals, large magnetic anisotropy is observed. Transport\nproperty measurements indicate that heavy Fe-doping leads to a large anisotropy\nof resistivity ($\\rho$$_{c}$/$\\rho$$_{ab}$). A sharp M-H hysteresis curve is\nobserved with magnetic field along c-axis, while a linear magnetization appears\nwith magnetic field applied in the ab-plane. The angular dependent magnetic\nsusceptibility from in-plane to out-of-plane indicates that magnetic moments\nare strongly pinned along the c-axis in an unconventional manner and the\ncoercive field reaches as large as 6 T at T = 5 K. First-principles calculation\nclearly suggests that the strong spin-orbital coupling give rise to such a\nlarge anisotropy of magnetism. The strong pinning effect of magnetic moments\nalong c-axis makes this material a very promising candidate for the development\nof spin-aligner in spintronics devices.\n", "  Time-reversal ($\\mathcal{T}$-) symmetry is fundamental to many physical\nprocesses. Typically, $\\mathcal{T}$-breaking for microscopic processes requires\nthe presence of magnetic field. However, for 2D massless Dirac billiards,\n$\\mathcal{T}$-symmetry is broken automatically by the mass confinement, leading\nto chiral quantum scars. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism of\n$\\mathcal{T}$-breaking by analyzing the local current of the scarring\neigenstates and their magnetic response to an Aharonov--Bohm flux. Our results\nunveil the complete understanding of the subtle $\\mathcal{T}$-breaking\nphenomena from both the semiclassical formula of chiral scars and the\nmicroscopic current and spin reflection at the boundaries, leading to a\ncontrolling scheme to change the chirality of the relativistic quantum scars.\nOur findings not only have significant implications on the transport behavior\nand spin textures of the relativistic pseudoparticles, but also add basic\nknowledge to relativistic quantum chaos.\n", "  GSC 4560-02157 is a new eclipsing cataclysmic variable with an orbital period\nof $0.265359$ days. By using the published $V-$ and $R-$band data together with\nour observations, we discovered that the $O-C$ curve of GSC 4560-02157 may\nshows a cyclic variation with the period of $3.51$ years and an amplitude of\n$1.40$ min. If this variation is caused by a light travel-time effect via the\nexistence of a third body, its mass can be derived as\n$M_{3}sini'\\approx91.08M_{Jup}$, it should be a low-mass star. In addition,\nseveral physical parameters were measured. The colour of the secondary star was\ndetermined as $V-R=0.77(\\pm0.03)$ which corresponds to a spectral type of K2-3.\nThe secondary star's mass was estimated as $M_{2}=0.73(\\pm0.02)M_{\\odot}$ by\ncombing the derived $V-R$ value around phase 0 with the assumption that it\nobeys the mass-luminosity relation of the main sequence stars. This mass is\nconsistent with the mass$-$period relation of CV donor stars. For the white\ndwarf, the eclipse durations and contacts of the white dwarf yield an upper\nlimit of the white dwarf's radius corresponding to a lower limit mass of\n$M_{1}\\approx0.501M_{\\odot}$. The overestimated radius and previously published\nspectral data indicate that the boundary layer may has a very high temperature.\n", "  Remarkable feature of the phase diagram of sulfur hydrides is a sharp\nincrease in critical temperature from 120K up to200K. This increase is a\nsignature of the structural transition. The study described below is concerned\nwith the nature of this phase transition. One can demonstrate that the symmetry\nanalysis along with an analysis of the impact of lattice deformations lead to\nthe conclusion that we are dealing with the first order transition. It leads to\nan abrupt appearance of small pockets on the Fermi surface and to the two-gap\nenergy spectrum.\n", "  Astrophysical and high-energy-density laboratory plasmas often have\nlarge-amplitude, sub-Larmor-scale electromagnetic fluctuations excited by\nvarious kinetic-streaming or anisotropy-driven instabilities. The Weibel (or\nthe filamentation) instability is particularly important because it can rapidly\ngenerate strong magnetic fields, even in the absence of seed fields. Particles\npropagating in collisionless plasmas with such small-scale magnetic fields\nundergo stochastic deflections similar to Coulomb collisions, with the magnetic\npitch-angle diffusion coefficient representing the effective \"collision\"\nfrequency. We show that this effect of the plasma \"quasi-collisionality\" can\nstrongly affect the growth rate and evolution of the Weibel instability in the\ndeeply nonlinear regime. This result is especially important for understanding\ncosmic-ray-driven turbulence in an upstream region of a collisionless shock of\na gamma-ray burst or a supernova. We demonstrate that the quasi-collisions\ncaused by the fields generated in the upstream suppress the instability\nslightly but can never shut it down completely. This confirms the assumptions\nmade in the self-similar model of the collisionless foreshock.\n", "  We present for the first time, a bidirectional Quantum Key Distribution\nprotocol with minimal encoding operations derived from the use of two\n`nonorthogonal' unitary transformations selected from two mutually unbiased\nunitary bases; which are indistinguishable in principle for a single use. Along\nwith its decoding procedure, it is a stark contrast to its `orthogonal\nencoding' predecessors. Defining a more relevant notion of security threshold\nfor such protocols, the current protocol outperforms its predecessor in terms\nof security as the maximal amount of information an eavesdropper can glean is\nessentially limited by the indistinguishability of the transformations. We\nfurther propose adaptations for a practical scenario and report on a proof of\nconcept experimental scheme based on polarised photons from an attenuated\npulsed laser for qubits, demonstrating the feasibility of such a protocol.\n", "  In this work, there are two parties, Alice on Earth and Bob on the satellite,\nwhich initially share an entangled state, and some open problems, which emerge\nduring quantum steering that Alice remotely steers Bob, are investigated. Our\nanalytical results indicate that all entangled pure states and maximally\nentangled evolution states (EESs) are steerable, and not every entangled\nevolution state is steerable and some steerable states are only locally\ncorrelated. Besides, quantum steering from Alice to Bob experiences a \"sudden\ndeath\" with increasing decoherence strength. However, shortly after that,\nquantum steering experiences a recovery with the increase of decoherence\nstrength in bit flip (BF) and phase flip (PF) channels. Interestingly, while\nthey initially share an entangled pure state, all EESs are steerable and obey\nBell nonlocality in PF and phase damping channels. In BF channels, all\nsteerable states can violate Bell-CHSH inequality, but some EESs are unable to\nbe employed to realize steering. However, when they initially share an\nentangled mixed state, the outcome is different from that of the pure state.\nFurthermore, the steerability of entangled mixed states is weaker than that of\nentangled pure states. Thereby, decoherence can induce the degradation of\nquantum steering, and the steerability of state is associated with the\ninteraction between quantum systems and reservoirs.\n", "  Spin, anomalous, and valley Hall effects in graphene-based hybrid structures\nare studied theoretically within the Green function formalism and linear\nresponse theory. Two different types of hybrid systems are considered in\ndetail: (i) graphene/boron nitride/cobalt(nickel), and (ii) graphene/YIG. The\nmain interest is focused on the proximity-induced exchange interaction between\ngraphene and magnetic substrate and on the proximity-enhanced spin-orbit\ncoupling. The proximity effects are shown to have a significant influence on\nthe electronic and spin transport properties of graphene. To find the spin,\nanomalous and valley Hall conductivities we employ certain effective\nHamiltonians which have been proposed recently for the hybrid systems under\nconsiderations. Both anomalous and valley Hall conductivities have universal\nvalues when the Fermi level is inside the energy gap in the electronic\nspectrum.\n", "  We propose correlated yet extremely simple single-parameter-dependent\nwave-functions with a Slater-type correlation factor, to describe excitons in\n0D, quasi-1D and quasi-2D semiconductor quantum dots. We provide closed-form\nformulas for the wave-function normalization factor, electron/hole\nsingle-particle density and the expectation value of the kinetic energy. We\nadditionally supply fast integration procedures for the Coulomb interaction in\nthe presence of dielectric mismatch with the surrounding medium for\nnanoplatelets (quasi-2D systems), and for the bare-Coulomb integral in long\nnanorods (quasi-1D systems).\n", "  Exact solutions for the elastic and thermodynamic properties for the wormlike\nchain model are elaborated in terms of Mathieu functions. The smearing of the\nclassical Euler buckling instability for clamped polymers is analyzed for the\nforce-extension relation. Interestingly, at strong compression forces the\nthermal fluctuations lead to larger elongations than for the elastic rod. The\nsusceptibility defined as the derivative of the force-extension relation\ndisplays a prominent maximum at a force that approaches the critical Euler\nbuckling force as the persistence length is increased. We also evaluate the\nexcess entropy and heat capacity induced by the compresssion and find that they\nvary non-monotonically with the load. These findings are corroborated by\npseudo-Brownian simulations.\n", "  By using the state-of-the-art microscopy and spectroscopy in\naberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes, we determine\nthe atomic arrangements, occupancy, elemental distribution, and the electronic\nstructures of dislocation cores in the 10{\\deg}tilted SrTiO3 bicrystal. We\nidentify that there are two different types of oxygen deficient dislocation\ncores, i.e., the SrO plane terminated Sr0.82Ti0.85O3-x (Ti3.67+, 0.48<x<0.91)\nand TiO2 plane terminated Sr0.63Ti0.90O3-y (Ti3.60+, 0.57<y<1). They have the\nsame Burgers vector of a[100] but different atomic arrangements and chemical\nproperties. Besides the oxygen vacancies, Sr vacancies and rocksalt-like\ntitanium oxide reconstruction are also identified in the dislocation core with\nTiO2 plane termination. Our atomic-scale study reveals the true atomic\nstructures and chemistry of individual dislocation cores, providing useful\ninsights into understanding the properties of dislocations and grain\nboundaries.\n", "  A major obstacle for the understanding of long electrical discharges is the\ncomplex dynamics of streamer coronas, formed by many thin conducting filaments.\nBuilding macroscopic models for these filaments is one approach to attain a\ndeeper knowledge of the discharge corona. Here we present a one-dimensional,\nmacroscopic model of a propagating streamer channel. We represent the streamer\nas an advancing finite-conductivity channel with a surface charge density at\nits boundary. This charge evolves self-consistently due to the electric current\nthat flows through the streamer body and within a thin layer at its surface. We\ncouple this electrodynamic evolution with a field-dependent set of chemical\nreactions that determine the internal channel conductivity. With this\none-dimensional model we investigate how key properties of a streamer affect\nthe channel's evolution. The ultimate objective of our model is to construct\nrealistic models of streamer coronas in order to understand better the physics\nof long electrical discharges.\n", "  In contrast with a gas at thermodynamic equilibrium, the mean force exerted\non a wall by a gas of active particles usually depends on the confining\npotential, thereby preventing a proper definition of mechanical pressure. In\nthis paper, we investigate numerically the properties of a gas of underdamped\nself-propelled dumbbells subject to Brownian noise of increasing intensity, in\norder to understand how the notion of pressure is recovered as noise\nprogressively masks the effects of self-propulsion and the system approaches\nthermodynamic equilibrium. The simulations performed for a mobile asymmetric\nwall separating two chambers containing an equal number of active dumbbells\nhighlight some subtle and unexpected properties of the system. First, Brownian\nnoise of moderate intensity is sufficient to let mean forces equilibrate for\nsmall values of the damping coefficient, while much stronger noise is required\nfor larger values of the damping coefficient. Moreover, the displacement of the\nmean position of the wall upon increase of the intensity of the noise is not\nnecessarily monotonous and may instead display changes of direction. Both facts\nactually reflect the existence of several mechanisms leading to the rupture of\nforce balance, which tend to displace the mean position of the wall towards\ndifferent directions and display different robustness against an increase of\nthe intensity of Brownian noise. This work therefore provides a clear\nillustration of the fact that driving an autonomous system towards (or away\nfrom) thermodynamic equilibrium may not be a straightforward process, but may\ninstead proceed through the variations of the relative weights of several\nconflicting mechanisms.\n", "  Two different dynamic decoupling strategies, the classic CPMG and the more\nrecently proposed UDD protocol are compared in the context of magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI). Both sequences were implemented on a 3T human MRI\nsystem and relaxometry was performed for a variety of tissue-mimicking agar and\nagarose gels. We find that CPMG provides moderately better decoupling than\n\\UDD. The results are consistent with experimental noise spectra obtained from\n\\textit{in vivo} spectroscopy results, which suggest that the type of noise\nspectra obtained would favor \\CPMG. Theoretical coherence pathway analysis\nfurther suggests that \\UDD\\ is more susceptible to systematic errors due to\nstatic magnetic and radio-frequency field inhomogeneity or imperfect excitation\nand refocusing pulse profiles.\n", "  Chemical compositions of giant planets provide a means to constrain how and\nwhere they form. Traditionally, super-stellar elemental abundances in giant\nplanets were thought to be possible due to accretion of metal-rich solids. Such\nenrichments are accompanied by oxygen-rich compositions (i.e. C/O below the\ndisc's value, assumed to be solar, C/O=0.54). Without solid accretion the\nplanets are expected to have sub-solar metallicity, but high C/O ratios. This\narises because the solids are dominated by oxygen-rich species, e.g. H$_2$O and\nCO$_2$, which freeze out in the disk earlier than CO, leaving the gas metal\npoor but carbon-rich. Here we demonstrate that super-solar metallicities can be\nachieved by gas accretion alone when growth and radial drift of pebbles are\nconsidered in protoplanetary discs. Through this mechanism planets may\nsimultaneously acquire super-solar metallicities and super-solar C/O ratios.\nThis happens because the pebbles transport volatile species inward as they\nmigrate through the disc, enriching the gas at snow lines where the volatiles\nsublimate. Furthermore, the planet's composition can be used to constrain where\nit formed. Since high C/H and C/O ratios cannot be created by accreting solids,\nit may be possible to distinguish between formation via pebble accretion and\nplanetesimal accretion by the level of solid enrichment. Finally, we expect\nthat Jupiter's C/O ratio should be near or above solar if its enhanced carbon\nabundance came through accreting metal rich gas. Thus Juno's measurement of\nJupiter's C/O ratio should determine whether Jupiter accreted its metals from\ncarbon rich gas or oxygen rich solids.\n", "  Spin-orbit splitting is an essential ingredient for our understanding of the\nshell structure in nuclei. One of the most important advantages of relativistic\nmean-field (RMF) models in nuclear physics is the fact that the large\nspin-orbit (SO) potential emerges automatically from the inclusion of\nLorentz-scalar and -vector potentials in the Dirac equation. It is therefore of\ngreat importance to compare the results of such models with experimental data.\nWe investigate the size of $2p$ and $1f$ splittings for the isotone chain\n$^{40}$Ca, $^{38}$Ar, $^{36}$S, and $^{34}$Si in the framework of various\nrelativistic and nonrelativistic density functionals. They are compared with\nthe results of nonrelativistic models and with recent experimental data.\n", "  Observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) allow for remote sensing of\nplasma properties in distant regions of the heliosphere. So far, most of the\nobservations have concerned only hydrogen atoms. In this paper, we present\nperspectives for observations of helium energetic neutral atoms (He ENAs). We\ncalculated the expected intensities of He ENAs created by the neutralization of\nhelium ions in the inner heliosheath and through the secondary ENA mechanism in\nthe outer heliosheath. We found that the dominant source region for He ENAs is\nthe inner heliosheath. The obtained magnitudes of intensity spectra suggest\nthat He ENAs can be observed with future ENA detectors, as those planned on\nInterstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe. Observing He ENAs is most likely\nfor energies from a few to a few tens of keV/nuc. Estimates of the expected\ncount rates show that the ratio of helium to hydrogen atoms registered in the\ndetectors can be as low as 1:10^4. Consequently, the detectors need to be\nequipped with an appropriate mass spectrometer capability, allowing for\nrecognition of chemical elements. Due to the long mean free paths of helium\nions in the inner heliosheath, He ENAs are produced also in the distant\nheliospheric tail. This implies that observations of He ENAs can resolve its\nstructure, which seems challenging from observations of hydrogen ENAs since\nenergetic protons are neutralized before they progress deeper in the\nheliospheric tail.\n", "  Both impurity- and magnetic-field-induced quasiparticle states in chiral\n$p$-wave superconductors are investigated theoretically by solving the\nBogoliubov--de Gennes equations self-consistently. At the strong scattering\nlimit, we find that a universal state bound to the impurity can be induced for\nboth a single nonmagnetic impurity and a single magnetic impurity. Furthermore,\nwe find that different chiral order parameters and the corresponding\nsupercurrents have uniform distributions around linear impurities. Calculations\nof the local density of states in the presence of an external magnetic field\nshow that the intensity peak of the zero-energy Majorana mode in the vortex\ncore can be enhanced dramatically by tuning the strength of the external\nmagnetic field or pairing interaction.\n", "  The multiple scattering of ultra relativistic electrons in an amorphous\nmatter leads to the suppression of the soft part of radiation spectrum (the\nLandau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect), and also can change essentially the angular\ndistribution of the emitted photons. A similar effect must take place in a\ncrystal for the coherent radiation of relativistic electron. The results of the\ntheoretical investigation of angular distributions and polarization of\nradiation by a relativistic electron passing through a thin (in comparison with\na coherence length) crystal at a small angle to the crystal axis are presented.\nThe electron trajectories in crystal were simulated using the binary collision\nmodel which takes into account both coherent and incoherent effects at\nscattering. The angular distribution of radiation and polarization were\ncalculated as a sum of radiation from each electron. It is shown that there are\nnontrivial angular distributions of the emitted photons and their polarization\nthat are connected to the superposition of the coherent scattering of electrons\nby atomic rows (\"doughnut scattering\" effect) and the suppression of radiation\n(similar to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in an amorphous matter). It is\nalso shown that circular polarization of radiation in the considered case is\nidentically zero.\n", "  It is proposed that Fermi-surface reconstruction in electron-doped\nLn_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_4 (Ln = Pr, Nd) and in hole-doped YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+y} and\nYBa_2Cu_4O_8 occurs when the Fermi arcs extend into the second Brillouin zone\n(BZ). The criterion employs the axial component of the Fermi-arc tips, \\hat{q}\n> 0.5, depending on both the position of the Fermi arc's center \\dot{Q} and the\nincommensurabity \\delta_c of unidirectional (striped) charge-density waves\n(CDWs). Qualitatively, the concave end-pieces of the Fermi arcs, terminated by\nBragg-reflection mirrors due to the CDWs and severed at the boundary of the\nfirst BZ by lattice Bragg reflection, are assumed to join and relax to convex\nloops. Those entities may correspond to the electron pockets attributed to the\nquantum oscillations observed in these compounds. The criterion also explains\nwhy no quantum oscillations are found in the simple hole-doped lanthanum\ncuprates, La_{2-x}Ae_xCuO_4 (Ae = Sr, Ba), and in the bismuth cuprates\nBi_2Sr_{2-x}La_xCuO_{6+y} and Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+y}. The possibility of quantum\noscillations in hole-doped, partly substituted La_{2-y-x}Ln_ySr_xCuO_4 (Ln =\nNd, Eu; y = 0.4, 0.2) in the high-end doping interval of their pseudogap phase,\n0.182 < x < 0.235, is raised. A geometric modification of Bragg-reflection\nmirrors applies to HgBa_2CuO_{4+y} where CDWs are bidirectional\n(checkerboard-like).\n", "  Within the framework of the cosmological theory of the Big Bang, F-theory\nthat unifies all four types of fundamental interactions is represented. Among\nthe most exciting predictions of physics beyond the Standard Model is the\nassumption of the space of extra dimensions that solves the hierarchy problem.\nWith the presence of this extra dimensions are connected the searches for\nKaluza-Klein partners of gravitons, gauge bosons and microscopic black holes at\nthe LHC. In the framework of F-theory, Calabi-Yau fourfold is considered as a\nspace of extra dimensions. We study the duality between the F-theory\ncompactified on the K3-surface and $E_8\\times E_8$ heterotic string\ncompactified on the torus, $T^2$. The set of BPS states corresponding to the\nCalabi-Yau fourfolds, which has either an elliptic curve or a K3-fibration as a\nlayer, is studied in the aspect of correspondence to the KK modes of the\nM-theory on $R^8\\times T^2 \\times S^1 / Z_2$. The singularities of the moduli\nspace of the Calabi-Yau fourfold make it possible to observe massive KK modes,\nthe masses of which are obtained from the M-theory of supergravity. The result\nis of interest for a theoretical understanding of the KK modes, the\nexperimental searches for which are carried out at the LHC.\n", "  A new frequency switching receiver structure is proposed for simultaneous\nwireless information and power transfer in multi-carrier communication systems.\nEach subcarrier is switched to either the energy harvesting unit or the\ninformation decoding unit, according to the optimal subcarrier allocation. To\nimplement the system, one-bit feedback is required for each subcarrier. Two\noptimization problems are defined, converted to binary knapsack problems, and\nsolved using dynamic programming approaches. Upper bounds are obtained using\ncontinuous relaxations. Power allocation is integrated to further increase the\nperformance. Numerical studies show that the proposed frequency switching based\nmodel is better than existing models in a wide range of parameters.\n", "  Solar X-ray jets are evidently made by a burst of reconnection of closed\nmagnetic field in a jet's base with ambient \"open\" field (1,2). In the\nwidely-accepted version of the \"emerging-flux\" model, that reconnection occurs\nat a current sheet between the open field and emerging closed field and also\nmakes a compact hot brightening that is usually observed at the edge of the\njet's base (1,3). Here we report on high-resolution X-ray and EUV observations\nof 20 randomly-selected X-ray jets in polar coronal holes. In each jet,\ncontrary to the emerging-flux model, a miniature version of the filament\neruptions that initiate coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (4-7) drives the\njet-producing reconnection, and the compact hot brightening is made by internal\nreconnection of the legs of the minifilament-carrying erupting closed field,\nanalogous to solar flares of larger-scale eruptions. Previous observations have\nfound that some jets are driven by base-field eruptions (8-10,12), but only one\nsuch study, of only one jet, provisionally questioned the emerging-flux model\n(13). Our observations support the view that solar filament eruptions are made\nby a fundamental explosive magnetic process that occurs on a vast range of\nscales, from the biggest CME/flare eruptions down to X-ray jets, and perhaps\ndown to even smaller jets that are candidates for powering coronal heating\n(10,14,15). A picture similar to that suggested by our observations was drawn\nbefore, inferred from different observations and based on a different origin of\nthe erupting minifilament flux rope (11) (see Methods).\n", "  A better understanding and anticipation of natural processes such as\nlandsliding or seismic fault activity requires detailed theoretical and\nexperimental analysis of rock mechanics and geomaterial dynamics. These last\ndecades, considerable progress has been made towards understanding deformation\nand fracture process in laboratory experiment on granular rock materials, as\nthe well-known shear banding experiment. One of the reasons for this progress\nis the continuous improvement in the instrumental techniques of observation.\nBut the lack of real time methods does not allow the detection of indicators of\nthe upcoming fracture process and thus to anticipate the phenomenon. Here, we\nhave performed uniaxial compression experiments to analyse the response of a\ngranular rock material sample to different shocks. We use a novel\ninterferometric laser sensor based on the nonlinear self-mixing interferometry\ntechnique to observe in real time the deformations of the sample and assess its\nusefulness as a diagnostic tool for the analysis of geomaterial dynamics. Due\nto the high spatial and temporal resolution of this approach, we observe both\nvibrations processes in response to a dynamic loading and the onset of failure.\nThe latter is preceded by a continuous variation of vibration period of the\nmaterial. After several shocks, the material response is no longer reversible\nand we detect a progressive accumulation of irreversible deformation leading to\nthe fracture process. We demonstrate that material failure is anticipated by\nthe critical slowing down of the surface vibrational motion, which may\ntherefore be envisioned as an early warning signal or predictor to the\nmacroscopic failure of the sample. The nonlinear self-mixing interferometry\ntechnique is readily extensible to fault propagation measurements. As such, it\nopens a new window of observation for the study of geomaterial deformation and\nfailure.\n", "  Active control of friction by ultrasonic vibration is a well-known effect\nwith numerous technical applications ranging from press forming to\nmicromechanical actuators. Reduction of friction is observed with vibration\napplied in any of the three possible directions (normal to the contact plane,\nin the direction of motion and in-plane transverse). In this work, we consider\nthe multi-mode active control of sliding friction, where phase-shifted\noscillations in two or more directions act at the same time. Our analysis is\nbased on a macroscopic contact-mechanical model that was recently shown to be\nwell-suited for describing dynamic frictional processes. For simplicity, we\nlimit our analysis to a constant, load-independent normal and tangential\nstiffness and two superimposed phase-shifted harmonic oscillations, one of them\nbeing normal to the plane and the other in the direction of motion. As in\nprevious works utilizing the present model, we assume a constant local\ncoefficient of friction, with reduction of the observed force of friction\narising entirely from the macroscopic dynamics of the system. Our numerical\nsimulations show that the resulting law of friction is determined by just three\ndimensionless parameters. Depending on the values of these parameters, three\nqualitatively different types of behavior are observed: (a) symmetric\nvelocity-dependence of the coefficient of friction (same for positive and\nnegative velocities), (b) asymmetric dependence with respect to the sign of the\nvelocity, but with zero force at zero velocity, and (c) asymmetric dependence\nwith non-zero force at zero velocity. The latter two cases can be interpreted\nas a \"dynamic ratchet\" (b) and an actuator (c).\n", "  If a civilization wants to maximize computation it appears rational to\naestivate until the far future in order to exploit the low temperature\nenvironment: this can produce a $10^{30}$ multiplier of achievable computation.\nWe hence suggest the \"aestivation hypothesis\": the reason we are not observing\nmanifestations of alien civilizations is that they are currently (mostly)\ninactive, patiently waiting for future cosmic eras. This paper analyzes the\nassumptions going into the hypothesis and how physical law and observational\nevidence constrain the motivations of aliens compatible with the hypothesis.\n", "  In this paper we study solutions of the critical Lane-Emden equation in\nhigher space dimensions. We show that after certain transformations the general\nsolution can be written in terms of elliptic functions. We restrict ourselves\nto real solutions which can be used in physical applications.\n", "  Path integral implementation of the quantum instanton approximation currently\nbelongs among the most accurate methods for computing quantum rate constants\nand kinetic isotope effects, but its use has been limited due to the rather\nhigh computational cost. Here we demonstrate that the efficiency of quantum\ninstanton calculations of the kinetic isotope effects can be increased by\norders of magnitude by combining two approaches: The convergence to the quantum\nlimit is accelerated by employing high-order path integral factorizations of\nthe Boltzmann operator, while the statistical convergence is improved by\nimplementing virial estimators for relevant quantities. After deriving several\nnew virial estimators for the high-order factorization and evaluating the\nresulting increase in efficiency, using $\\mathrm{\\cdot\nH_{\\alpha}+H_{\\beta}H_{\\gamma}\\rightarrow H_{\\alpha}H_{\\beta}+\\cdot H_{\\gamma\n}}$ reaction as an example, we apply the proposed method to obtain several\nkinetic isotope effects on $\\mathrm{CH_{4}+\\cdot H\\rightleftharpoons\\cdot\nCH_{3}+H_{2}}$ forward and backward reactions.\n", "  Accurate path integral Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics calculations of\nisotope effects have until recently been expensive because of the necessity to\nreduce three types of errors present in such calculations: statistical errors\ndue to sampling, path integral discretization errors, and thermodynamic\nintegration errors. While the statistical errors can be reduced with virial\nestimators and path integral discretization errors with high-order\nfactorization of the Boltzmann operator, here we propose a method for\naccelerating isotope effect calculations by eliminating the integration error.\nWe show that the integration error can be removed entirely by changing particle\nmasses stochastically during the calculation and by using a piecewise linear\numbrella biasing potential. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that this\napproach does not increase the statistical error. The resulting acceleration of\nisotope effect calculations is demonstrated on a model harmonic system and on\ndeuterated species of methane.\n", "  There has recently been growing evidence that atrial fibrillation (AF), the\nmost common cardiac arrhythmia, is independently associated with the risk of\ndementia. This represents a very recent frontier with high social impact for\nthe number of individuals involved and for the expected increase in AF\nincidence in the next 40 years. Although a number of potential haemodynamic\nprocesses, such as microembolisms, altered cerebral blood flow, hypoperfusion\nand microbleeds, arise as connecting links between the two pathologies, the\ncausal mechanisms are far from clear. An in silico approach is proposed that\ncombines in sequence two lumped-parameter schemes, for the cardiovascular\nsystem and the cerebral circulation. The systemic arterial pressure is obtained\nfrom the cardiovascular system and used as the input for the cerebral\ncirculation, with the aim of studying the role of AF on the cerebral\nhaemodynamics with respect to normal sinus rhythm (NSR), over a 5000 beat\nrecording. In particular, the alteration of the haemodynamic (pressure and\nflowrate) patterns in the microcirculation during AF is analysed by means of\ndifferent statistical tools, from correlation coefficients to autocorrelation\nfunctions, crossing times, extreme values analysis and multivariate linear\nregression models. A remarkable signal alteration, such as a reduction in\nsignal correlation (NSR, about 3 s; AF, less than 1 s) and increased\nprobability (up to three to four times higher in AF than in NSR) of extreme\nvalue events, emerges for the peripheral brain circulation. The described\nscenario offers a number of plausible cause-effect mechanisms that might\nexplain the occurrence of critical events and the haemodynamic links relating\nto AF and dementia.\n", "  The hypernuclear systems $NN\\Xi $ and $\\Xi\\Xi N$ are considered as an\nanalogue of $nnp$ ($^3$H) nuclear system (with the notation as $AAB$ system).\nWe use the recently proposed modification for the $s$-wave Malfliet-Tjon\npotential. The modification simulates the Extended-Soft-Core model (ESC08c) for\nbaryon-baryon interactions. The $\\Xi N$ spin/isospin triplet $(S, I)=(1, 1)$\npotential generates a bound state with the energy $B_2(AB)$=1.56~MeV.\nThree-body binding energy $B_3$ for the states with maximal total isospin is\ncalculated employing the configuration-space Faddeev equations. Comparison with\nthe results obtained within the integral representation for the equations is\npresented. The different types of the relation between $B_2$ and\n$B_3(V_{AA}=0)$ are discussed.\n", "  A first determination of the strong coupling $\\alpha_s(m_Z)$ in\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) from inclusive jet and dijet production\ncross sections in deep-inelastic scattering at HERA is presented. Data\ncollected by the H1 experiment in the years 1995 to 2007 covering the range of\nmomentum transfer $5.5<Q^2<15\\,000\\,{\\rm GeV}^2$ and jet transverse momenta\n$P_T>4.5\\,{\\rm GeV}$ are explored. The strong coupling is determined in a fit\nto inclusive jet and dijet data to $\\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1157\\,(6)_{\\rm\nexp}\\,(^{+31}_{-26})_{\\rm theo}$. Further studies on the phenomenological\napplication of the new NNLO calculations and on fits to the individual data\nsets are presented. The running of the strong coupling is probed in a single\nexperiment over one order of magnitude in the remormalisation scale and\nconsistency with the QCD expectations is found.\n", "  In many gravitational interactions between galaxies, gas and stars that have\nbeen torn from either or both of the precursor galaxies can collect in 'tidal\ntails'. Star formation begins anew in these regions to produce 'tidal dwarf\ngalaxies', giving insight into the process of galaxy formation through the\nwell-defined timescale of the interaction. But tracking the star formation\nprocess has proved to be difficult: the tidal dwarf galaxies with young stars\nshowed no evidence of the molecular gas out of which new stars form. Here we\nreport the discovery of molecular gas (carbon monoxide emission) in two tidal\ndwarf galaxies. In both cases, the molecular gas peaks at the same location as\nthe maximum in atomic-hydrogen density, unlike most gas-rich galaxies. We infer\nfrom this that the molecular gas formed from the HI, rather than being torn in\nmolecular form from the interacting galaxies. Star formation in the tidal\ndwarfs appears to mimic that process in normal spiral galaxies like our own.\n", "  The origin of the hard (2-10 keV) X-ray background has remained mysterious\nfor over 35 years. Most of the soft (0.5-2 keV) X-ray background has been\nresolved into discrete sources, which are primarily quasars; however, these\nsources do not have the flat spectral shape required to match the X-ray\nbackground spectrum. Here we report the results of an X-ray survey 30 times\nmore sensitive than previous studies in the hard band and four times more\nsensitive in the soft band. The sources detected in our survey account for at\nleast 75 per cent of the hard X-ray background. The mean X-ray spectrum of\nthese sources is in good agreement with that of the background. The X-ray\nemission from the majority of the detected sources is unambiguously associated\nwith either the nuclei of otherwise normal bright galaxies or optically faint\nsources, which could either be active nuclei of dust enshrouded galaxies or the\nfirst quasars at very high redshifts.\n", "  Most of the matter in the universe is not luminous and can be observed\ndirectly only through its gravitational effect. An emerging technique called\nweak gravitational lensing uses background galaxies to reveal the foreground\ndark matter distribution on large scales. Light from very distant galaxies\ntravels to us through many intervening overdensities which gravitationally\ndistort their apparent shapes. The observed ellipticity pattern of these\ndistant galaxies thus encodes information about the large-scale structure of\nthe universe, but attempts to measure this effect have been inconclusive due to\nsystematic errors. We report the first detection of this ``cosmic shear'' using\n145,000 background galaxies to reveal the dark matter distribution on angular\nscales up to half a degree in three separate lines of sight. The observed\nangular dependence of this effect is consistent with that predicted by two\nleading cosmological models, providing new and independent support for these\nmodels.\n", "  We report measurements on ultrathin (<10 nm) nanowires produced by coating\ncarbon nanotubes with a superconducting amorphous MoGe alloy. We find that\nnanowires can be superconducting or insulating depending on their normal state\nresistance $R_{N}$ compared to $R_{q}=h/(2e)^{2}$ -- the quantum resistance for\nCooper pairs. If $R_{N}< R_{q}$ the tunneling of quantum phase slips (QPS) is\nprohibited due to strong damping, and so the wires stay superconducting. The\ninsulating state, observed if $R_{N}> R_{q}$, is explained in terms of\nproliferation of quantum phase slips and corresponding localization of Cooper\npairs. The observed superconductor-insulator transition is analogous to the\ndissipative phase transition which takes place in Josephson Junctions at\n$R_{N}= R_{q}$ (Penttila et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. Vol.82, p.1004, 1999)\n", "  There is increasing evidence that inhomogeneous distributions of charge and\nspin--so-called \"striped phases\"--play an important role in determining the\nproperties of the high-temperature superconductors. For example, recent\nneutron-scattering measurements on the YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ family of\nmaterials show both spin and charge fluctuations that are consistent with the\nstriped-phase picture. But the fluctuations associated with a striped phase are\nexpected to be one-dimensional, whereas the magnetic fluctuations observed to\ndate appear to display two-dimensional symmetry. We show here that this\napparent two-dimensionality results from measurements on twinned crystals, and\nthat similar measurements on substantially detwinned crystals of\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.6}$ reveal the one-dimensional character of the magnetic\nfluctuations, thus greatly strengthening the striped-phase interpretation.\nMoreover, our results also suggest that superconductivity originates in charge\nstripes that extend along the b crystal axis, where the superfluid density is\nfound to be substantially larger than for the a direction.\n", "  The Kondo effect is a key many-body phenomenon in condensed matter physics.\nIt concerns the interaction between a localised spin and free electrons.\nDiscovered in metals containing small amounts of magnetic impurities, it is now\na fundamental mechanism in a wide class of correlated electron systems. Control\nover single, localised spins has become relevant also in fabricated structures\ndue to the rapid developments in nano-electronics. Experiments have already\ndemonstrated artificial realisations of isolated magnetic impurities at\nmetallic surfaces, nanometer-scale magnets, controlled transitions between\ntwo-electron singlet and triplet states, and a tunable Kondo effect in\nsemiconductor quantum dots. Here, we report an unexpected Kondo effect realised\nin a few-electron quantum dot containing singlet and triplet spin states whose\nenergy difference can be tuned with a magnetic field. This effect occurs for an\neven number of electrons at the degeneracy between singlet and triplet states.\nThe characteristic energy scale is found to be much larger than for the\nordinary spin-1/2 case.\n", "  We calculate the electrical resistivity due to electron-phonon scattering for\na model of A3C60 (A= K, Rb), using an essentially exact quantum Monte-Carlo\ncalculation. In agreement with experiment, we obtain exceptionally large\nmetallic resistivities at large temperatures T. This illustrates that the\napparent mean free path can be much shorter than the separation of the\nmolecules. An interpretation of this result is given. The calculation also\nexplains the linear behavior in T at small T.\n", "  The realization that electron localization in disordered systems (Anderson\nlocalization) is ultimately a wave phenomenon has led to the suggestion that\nphotons could be similarly localized by disorder. This conjecture attracted\nwide interest because the differences between photons and electrons - in their\ninteractions, spin statistics, and methods of injection and detection - may\nopen a new realm of optical and microwave phenomena, and allow a detailed study\nof the Anderson localization transition undisturbed by the Coulomb interaction.\nTo date, claims of three-dimensional photon localization have been based on\nobservations of the exponential decay of the electromagnetic wave as it\npropagates through the disordered medium. But these reports have come under\nclose scrutiny because of the possibility that the decay observed may be due to\nresidual absorption, and because absorption itself may suppress localization.\nHere we show that the extent of photon localization can be determined by a\ndifferent approach - measurement of the relative size of fluctuations of\ncertain transmission quantities. The variance of relative fluctuations\naccurately reflects the extent of localization, even in the presence of\nabsorption. Using this approach, we demonstrate photon localization in both\nweakly and strongly scattering quasi-one-dimensional dielectric samples and in\nperiodic metallic wire meshes containing metallic scatterers, while ruling it\nout in three-dimensional mixtures of aluminum spheres.\n", "  The glass transition can simply be viewed as the point at which the viscosity\nof a structurally disordered liquid reaches 10^{13} Poise [1]. This definition\nis operational but it sidesteps fundamental controversies about the glass: Is\nthe transition a purely dynamical phenomenon [2]? This would mean that\nergodicity gets broken, but that thermodynamic properties of the liquid remain\nunchanged across the transition if determined as thermodynamic equilibrium\naverages over the whole phase space. The opposite view [3-6] claims that an\nunderlying thermodynamic phase transition is responsible for the dramatic\nslowdown at the liquid-glass boundary. Such a phase transition (which shows up\nin proper equilibrium phase space averages) would trigger the dynamic\nstandstill, and then get masked by it. A recent Monte Carlo algorithm [7]\nintroduces non-local moves for hard-core systems in a way which preserves\nmicro-reversibility. Here we use this method to equilibrate a two-dimensional\nhard disc system far within its glassy phase. We show that indications of a\nthermodynamic transition are lacking up to very high densities, and that the\nglass is indistinguishable from the liquid on purely thermodynamic grounds.\n", "  World records in athletics provide a measure of physical as well as\nphysiological human performance. Here we analyse running records and show that\nthe mean speed as a function of race time can be described by two scaling laws\nthat have a breakpoint at about 150-170 seconds (corresponding to the ~1,000 m\nrace). We interpret this as being the transition time between anaerobic and\naerobic energy expenditure by athletes.\n", "  Turbulence is one of the most fascinating phenomena in nature and one of the\nbiggest challenges for modern physics. It is common knowledge that a flow of a\nsimple, Newtonian fluid is likely to be turbulent, when velocity is high,\nviscosity is low and size of the tank is large\\cite{Landau,Tritt}. Solutions of\nflexible long-chain polymers are known as visco-elastic fluids\\cite{bird}. In\nour experiments we show, that flow of a polymer solution with large enough\nelasticity can become quite irregular even at low velocity, high viscosity and\nin a small tank. The fluid motion is excited in a broad range of spatial and\ntemporal scales. The flow resistance increases by a factor of about twenty. So,\nwhile the Reynolds number, $\\boldmath{Re}$, may be arbitrary low, the observed\nflow has all main features of developed turbulence, and can be compared to\nturbulent flow in a pipe at $\\bf {Re\\simeq 10^5}$\\cite{Landau,Tritt}. This {\\it\nelastic turbulence} is accompanied by significant stretching of the polymer\nmolecules, and the resulting increase of the elastic stresses can reach two\norders of magnitude.\n", "  A photon in an arbitrary polarization state cannot be cloned perfectly. But\nsuppose that at our disposal we have several copies of an unknown photon. Is it\npossible to delete the information content of one or more of these photons by a\nphysical process? Specifically, if two photons are in the same initial\npolarization state is there a mechanism that produces one photon in the same\ninitial state and the other in some standard polarization state. If this can be\ndone, then one would create a standard blank state onto which one could copy an\nunknown state approximately, by deterministic cloning or exactly, by\nprobabilistic cloning. This might be useful in quantum computation, where one\ncould store some new information in an already computed state by deleting the\nold information. Here we show that the linearity of quantum theory does not\nallow us to delete a copy of an arbitrary quantum state perfectly. Though in a\nclassical computer information can be deleted against a copy, the same task\ncannot be accomplished with quantum information.\n"]}
