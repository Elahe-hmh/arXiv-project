The review of papers where such techniques have been\napplied to study the Fermi surface of metallic materials with showing their\nmain results is also done.\n", "  Based on a QED Lagrangian with additional photon-photon coupling an explicit\nbound state description is presented, attempting a physical correct and\nparameter free description of free particles. Applied to p-e- and e+-e-\nsystems, with a \"harmonic\" boundary condition the deduced binding energies are\nconsistent with Coulomb energies and radii in general agreement with other\nmodels. The sum of partial coupling strengths is in good agreement with\nalpha_QED sim 1/137, showing that this important constant can be deduced from\nfirst principles.\n", "  Starting from Feynman's Lagrangian description of quantum mechanics, we\npropose a method to construct explicitly the propagator for the Wigner\ndistribution function of a single system. For general quadratic Lagrangians,\nonly the classical phase space trajectory is found to contribute to the\npropagator. Inspired by Feynman's and Vernon's influence functional theory we\nextend the method to calculate the propagator for the reduced Wigner function\nof a system of interest coupled to an external system. Explicit expressions are\nobtained when the external system consists of a set of independent harmonic\noscillators. As an example we calculate the propagator for the reduced Wigner\nfunction associated with the Caldeira-Legett model.\n", "  We review and update the interpretation of the 125 GeV scalar as the lightest\nHiggs boson of the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model, allowing for CP violation in the\npotential. The detection of a charged Higgs boson would exclude the Standard\nModel. Proposed benchmarks for charged-Higgs searches in the channel pp\\to\nH^+W^-X\\to W^+W^-H_1X are reviewed and updated.\n", "  We present an analysis of both the Neutral Current (NC) and Charged Current\n(CC) Drell-Yan processes at the LHC within a 4 Dimensional realization of a\nComposite Higgs model studying the cross sections and taking into account the\npossible impact of the extra fermions present in the spectrum.\n", "  We study the phenomenology of both the Neutral Current (NC) and Charged\nCurrent (CC) Drell-Yan (DY) processes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within\na 4 Dimensional realization of a Composite Higgs model with partial\ncompositness by estimating the integrated and differential event rates and\ntaking into account the possible impact of the extra fermions present in the\nspectrum. We show that, in certain regions of the parameters space, the\nmultiple neutral resonances present in the model can be distinguishable and\nexperimentally accessible in the invariant or transverse mass distributions.\n", "  The shallow decay phase and flares in the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) is widely believed to be associated with the later activation of central\nengine. Some models of energy injection involve with a continuous energy flow\nsince the GRB trigger time, such as the magnetic dipole radiation from a\nmagnetar. However, in the scenario involving with a black hole accretion\nsystem, the energy flow from the fall-back accretion may be delayed for a\nfall-back time $\\sim t_{\\rm fb}$. Thus we propose a delayed energy injection\nmodel, the delayed energy would cause a notable rise to the Lorentz factor of\nthe external shock, which will \"generate\" a bump in the multiple band\nafterglows. If the delayed time is very short, our model degenerates to the\nprevious models. Our model can well explain the significant re-brightening in\nthe optical and infrared light curves of GRB 081029 and GRB 100621A. A\nconsiderable fall-back mass is needed to provide the later energy, this\nindicates GRBs accompanied with fall-back material may be associated with a low\nenergy supernova so that fraction of the envelope can be survived during\neruption. The fall-back time can give meaningful information of the properties\nof GRB progenitor stars.\n", "  We examine the magnitude and size evolution of bulgeless (discs with no-bulge\nor pseudo-bulge) galaxies up to z~0.9 in rest-frame B-band. Their evolution is\ncompared to that of normal-discs (discs with classical-bulge). The study is\ndone for luminous sources (M_B<=-20) in two equal-volume redshift-bins\n(0.4<=z<0.77 and 0.77<=z<1.0) and a local range (0.02<=z<0.05). The mean\nsurface-brightness, from z_{mean}=0.89 to z_{mean}=0.04, shows a dimming of\n0.79 mag for bulgeless galaxies and 1.16 mag for normal-discs. The\ncharacteristic magnitude, M_B^*, shows an increase of 0.55-mag for bulgeless\ngalaxies and 0.95-mag for normal-discs. Both dimming and faintness observed\nsince z~0.9 are more pronounced for the normal-discs by ~0.4-mag. The\nsize-distribution is log-normal and both bulgeless and normal-discs show a\nslight increase in the mean value from z_{mean}=0.89 to z_{mean}=0.04. The\nproportion of bulgeless galaxies in the full disc sample undergoes a\nconsiderable decline with decrease in redshift. This along with the larger\ndimming and faintness seen for normal-discs suggests that some fraction of the\nbulgeless sources switch to the normal-disc morphology with time. To ascertain\nthe validity of studying morphology in the optical, the properties of the\ngalaxies observed in both rest-frame B and I-band are compared. The common\nsample is more luminous in the I-band but the sizes are larger in the B-band\nfor more than 74 % of the sources. The variation in the sersic-index values of\nthe galaxies in the two rest-bands is minor enough to have any affect on the\nmorphological classification.\n", "  In this letter the phenomenon of macroscopic quantization is investigated\nusing the particle on the ring interacting with the dissipative environment as\nan example. It is shown that the phenomenon of macroscopic quantization has the\nclear physical origin in that case. It follows from the angular momentum\nconservation combined with momentum quantization for bare particle on the ring\n. The existence an observable which can take only integer values in the zero\ntemperature limit is rigorously proved. With the aid of the mapping between\nparticle on the ring and Ambegaokar-Eckern-Schon model, which can be used to\ndescribe single-electron devices, it is demonstrated that this observable is\nanalogous to the \"effective charge\" introduced by Burmistrov and Pruisken for\nthe single-electron box problem. Different consequences of the revealed physics\nare discussed, as well as a generalization of the obtained results to the case\nof more complicated systems.\n", "  The equation of motion for the reduced Wigner function of a system coupled to\nan external quantum system is presented for the specific case when the external\nquantum system can be modeled as a set of harmonic oscillators. The result is\nderived from the Wigner function formulation of the Feynman-Vernon influence\nfunctional theory. It is shown how the true self-energy for the equation of\nmotion is connected with the influence functional for the path integral.\nExplicit expressions are derived in terms of the bare Wigner propagator.\nFinally, we show under which approximations the resulting equation of motion\nreduces to the Wigner-Boltzmann equation.\n", "  Composite Higgs models provide an elegant solution to the hierarchy problem\npresent in the Standard Model (SM) and give an alternative pattern leading to\nthe mechanism of Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB). We present an analysis\nof the Higgs boson production and decay within a recently proposed realistic\nrealization of this general idea: the 4D Composite Higgs Model (4DCHM).\nComparing our results with the latest Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data we show\nthat the 4DCHM could provide an alternative explanation with respect to the SM\nof the LHC results pointing to the discovery of a Higgs-like particle at 125\nGeV.\n", "  A method is presented to obtain the linear response coefficients of a system\ncoupled to a bath. The method is based on a systematic truncation of the\nLiouville equation for the reduced distribution function. The first order\ntruncation results are expected to be accurate in the low temperature and weak\ncoupling regime. Explicit expressions for the conductivity of the Fr\\\"ohlich\npolaron are obtained, and the discrepancy between the Kadanoff and the\nFeynman-Hellwarth-Iddings-Platzmann mobility is elucidated.\n", "  In this paper we reconsider the notion of an optimal effective Hamiltonian\nfor the semiclassical propagation of the Wigner distribution in phase space. An\nexplicit expression for the optimal effective Hamiltonian is obtained in the\nshort time limit by minimizing the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the\nsemiclassical approximation and the real state of the system. The method is\nillustrated for the quartic oscillator.\n", "  We present the first order self-energy correction to the linear response\ncoefficients of polaronic systems within the truncated phase space approach\ndeveloped by the present authors. Due to the system-bath coupling, the external\npertubation induces a retarded internal field which dynamically screens the\nexternal force. Whereas the effect on the mobility is of second order,\ndynamical properties such as the effective mass and the optical absorption are\nmodified in first order. The Fr\\\"ohlich polaron is used to illustrate the\nresults.\n", "  We explore the possibility that the fundamental theory of nature does not\ncontain any scale. This implies a renormalizable quantum gravity theory where\nthe graviton kinetic term has 4 derivatives, and can be reinterpreted as\ngravity minus an anti-graviton. We compute the super-Planckian RGE of\nadimensional gravity coupled to a generic matter sector. The Planck scale and a\nflat space can arise dynamically at quantum level provided that a quartic\nscalar coupling and its $\\beta$ function vanish at the Planck scale. This is\nhow the Higgs boson behaves for $M_h\\approx 125$ GeV at $M_t\\approx 171$ GeV.\nWithin agravity, inflation is a generic phenomenon: the slow-roll parameters\nare given by the $\\beta$-functions of the theory, and are small if couplings\nare perturbative. The predictions $n_s\\approx 0.967$ and $r\\approx 0.13$ arise\nif the inflaton is identified with the Higgs of gravity. Furthermore,\nquadratically divergent corrections to the Higgs mass vanish: a small weak\nscale is natural and can be generated by agravity quantum corrections.\n", "  Re-brightening bumps are frequently observed in gamma-ray burst (GRB)\nafterglows. Many scenarios have been proposed to interpret the origin of these\nbumps, of which a blast wave encountering a density-jump in the circumburst\nenvironment has been questioned by recent works. We develop a set of\ndifferential equations to calculate the relativistic outflow encountering the\ndensity-jump by extending the work of Huang et al. (1999). This approach is a\nsemi-analytic method and is very convenient. Our results show that late\nhigh-amplitude bumps can not be produced under common conditions, only short\nplateau may emerge even when the encounter occurs at early time ($< 10^4$ s).\nIn general, our results disfavor the density-jump origin for those observed\nbumps, which is consistent with the conclusion drawn from full hydrodynamics\nstudies. The bumps thus should be due to other scenarios.\n", "  General Composite Higgs models provide an elegant solution to the hierarchy\nproblem present in the Standard Model and give an alternative pattern leading\nto the mechanism of electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking. We present an analysis\nof a realistic realization of this general idea, namely the 4DCHM, analysing\nthe Higgs production and decay modes, fitting them to the latest LHC showing\nthe compatibility with the results of the CERN machine. We then present the\nprospects of a future electron positron collider of testing this model against\nthe expected experimental accuracies in the various Higgs decay channels\naccessible herein.\n", "  We reconsider the non-equilibrium dynamics of closed quantum systems. In\nparticular we focus on the thermalization of integrable systems. Here we show\nhow the generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) can be constructed as the best\napproximation to the time dependent density matrix. Our procedure allows for a\nsystematic construction of the GGE by a constrained minimization of the\ndistance between the latter and the true state. Moreover, we show that the\nentropy of the GGE is a direct measure for the quality of the approximation. We\napply our method to a quenched hard core bose gas. In contrast to the standard\nGGE, our correlated GGE properly describes the higher order correlation\nfunctions.\n", "  We analyse the evolution of primordial magnetic fields in spatially flat\nFriedmann universes and reconsider the belief that, after inflation, these\nfields decay adiabatically on all scales. Without~abandoning classical\nelectromagnetism or standard cosmology, we demonstrate that this is not\nnecessarily the case for superhorizon-sized magnetic fields. The underlying\nreason for this is causality, which confines the post-inflationary process of\nelectric-current formation, electric-field elimination and magnetic-flux\nfreezing within the horizon. As a result, the adiabatic magnetic decay is not\na~priori guaranteed on super-Hubble scales. Instead, after inflation,\nlarge-scale magnetic fields obey a~power-law solution, where one of the modes\ndrops at a rate slower than the adiabatic. Whether this slowly decaying mode\ncan dominate and dictate the post-inflationary magnetic evolution depends on\nthe initial conditions. These are determined by the evolution of the field\nduring inflation and by the nature of the transition from the de Sitter phase\nto the reheating era and then to the subsequent epochs of radiation and dust.\nWe discuss two alternative and complementary scenarios to illustrate the role\nand the implications of the initial conditions for cosmic magnetogenesis. Our\nmain claim is that magnetic fields can be superadiabatically amplified after\ninflation, as long as they remain outside the horizon. This means that\ninflation-produced fields can reach astrophysically relevant residual strengths\nwithout breaking away from standard physics. Moreover, using the same causality\narguments, one can constrain (or in some cases assist) the non-conventional\nscenarios of primordial magnetogenesis that amplify their fields during\ninflation. Finally, we show that our results extend naturally to the marginally\nopen and the marginally closed Friedmann universes.\n", "  Strange quark matter (SQM) may be the true ground state of hadronic matter,\nindicating that the observed pulsars may actually be strange stars, but not\nneutron stars. According to this SQM hypothesis, the existence of a\nhydrostatically stable sequence of strange quark matter stars has been\npredicted, ranging from 1 --- 2 solar mass strange stars, to smaller strange\ndwarfs and even strange planets. While gravitational wave (GW) astronomy is\nexpected to open a new window to the universe, it will shed light on the\nsearching for SQM stars. Here we show that due to their extreme compactness,\nstrange planets can spiral very close to their host strange stars, without\nbeing tidally disrupted. Like inspiraling neutron stars or black holes, these\nsystems would serve as a new kind of sources for GW bursts, producing strong\ngravitational waves at the final stage. The events occurring in our local\nUniverse can be detected by the upcoming gravitational wave detectors, such as\nAdvanced LIGO and the Einstein Telescope. This effect provides a unique probe\nto SQM objects and is hopefully a powerful tool for testing the SQM hypothesis.\n", "  We study a system of N particles with logarithmic, Coulomb or Riesz pairwise\ninteractions, confined by an external potential. We examine a microscopic\nquantity, the tagged empirical field, for which we prove a large deviation\nprinciple at speed N. The rate function is the sum of an entropy term, the\nspecific relative entropy, and an energy term, the renormalized energy\nintroduced in previous works, coupled by the temperature. We deduce a\nvariational property of the sine-beta processes which arise in random matrix\ntheory. We also give a next-to-leading order expansion of the free energy of\nthe system, proving the existence of the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are newly discovered radio transient sources. Their\nhigh dispersion measures indicate an extragalactic origin. But due to the lack\nof observational data in other wavelengths, their progenitors still remain\nunclear. Here we suggest the collisions between neutron stars and\nasteroids/comets as a promising mechanism for FRBs. During the impact process,\na hot plasma fireball will form after the material of the small body penetrates\ninto the neutron star surface. The ionized matter inside the fireball will then\nexpand along the magnetic field lines. Coherent radiation from the thin shell\nat the top of the fireball will account for the observed FRBs. Our scenario can\nreasonably explain the main features of FRBs, such as their durations,\nluminosities, and the event rate. We argue that for a single neutron star, FRBs\nare not likely to happen repeatedly in a forseeable time span since such\nimpacts are of low probability. We predict that faint remnant X-ray emissions\nshould be associated with FRBs, but it may be too faint to be detected by\ndetectors at work.\n", "  The nucleon decay is a significant phenomenon to verify grand unified\ntheories (GUTs). For the precise prediction of the nucleon lifetime induced by\nthe gauge bosons associated with the unified gauge group, it is important to\ninclude the renormalization effects on the Wilson coefficients of the\ndimension-six baryon number violating operators. In this study, we have derived\nthe threshold corrections to these coefficients at the one-loop level in the\nminimal supersymmetric SU(5) GUT and the extended one with additional SU(5)\nvector-like pairs. As a result, it is found that the nucleon decay rate is\nenhanced about 5% in the minimal setup, and then the enhancement could become\nsmaller in the vector-like matter extensions.\n", "  We update the allowed parameter space of the CP-violating 2HDM with Type II\nYukawa couplings, that survives the current experimental and theoretical\nconstraints on the model. For a representative set of allowed parameter points,\nwe study the production of charged Higgs bosons, both at the LHC at 14 TeV and\nat a possible future hadronic collider at 30 TeV. Two classes of production\nmechanisms are considered, \"bosonic\" (pp\\to H^\\pm W^\\mp X) and \"fermionic\" (pp\n\\to H^+ \\bar t (b) X). After commenting on our previous H^\\pm\\to W^\\pm H_1\ninvestigation, we focus on the tauonic decay mode, H^\\pm \\to \\tau\\nu,\nperforming a detailed signal-over-background analysis at the parton level. The\nincreased features provided when considering CP violation, i.e., the extension\nof the parameter space and the mixing of the would-be CP-odd scalar boson, only\nmarginally increase the discovery prospects, which remain very challenging both\nwhen increased luminosities and higher energies are considered.\n", "  Recently, the first author has extended the definition of the zeta function\nassociated with fractal strings to arbitrary bounded subsets $A$ of the\n$N$-dimensional Euclidean space ${\\mathbb R}^N$, for any integer $N\\ge1$. It is\ndefined by $\\zeta_A(s)=\\int_{A_{\\delta}}d(x,A)^{s-N}\\,\\mathrm{d} x$ for all\n$s\\in\\mathbb{C}$ with $\\operatorname{Re}\\,s$ sufficiently large, and we call it\nthe distance zeta function of $A$. Here, $d(x,A)$ denotes the Euclidean\ndistance from $x$ to $A$ and $A_{\\delta}$ is the $\\delta$-neighborhood of $A$,\nwhere $\\delta$ is a fixed positive real number. We prove that the abscissa of\nabsolute convergence of $\\zeta_A$ is equal to $\\overline\\dim_BA$, the upper box\n(or Minkowski) dimension of $A$. Particular attention is payed to the principal\ncomplex dimensions of $A$, defined as the set of poles of $\\zeta_A$ located on\nthe critical line $\\{\\mathop{\\mathrm{Re}} s=\\overline\\dim_BA\\}$, provided\n$\\zeta_A$ possesses a meromorphic extension to a neighborhood of the critical\nline. We also introduce a new, closely related zeta function,\n$\\tilde\\zeta_A(s)=\\int_0^{\\delta} t^{s-N-1}|A_t|\\,\\mathrm{d} t$, called the\ntube zeta function of $A$. Assuming that $A$ is Minkowski measurable, we show\nthat, under some mild conditions, the residue of $\\tilde\\zeta_A$ computed at\n$D=\\dim_BA$ (the box dimension of $A$), is equal to the Minkowski content of\n$A$. More generally, without assuming that $A$ is Minkowski measurable, we show\nthat the residue is squeezed between the lower and upper Minkowski contents of\n$A$. We also introduce transcendentally quasiperiodic sets, and construct a\nclass of such sets, using generalized Cantor sets, along with Baker's theorem\nfrom the theory of transcendental numbers.\n", "  We present and analyze correlation functions of a main-chain polymer nematic\nin a continuum worm-like chain description for two types of constraints\nformalized by the tensorial and vectorial conservation laws, both originating\nin the microscopic chain integrity, i.e., the conectivity of the polymer\nchains. In particular, our aim is to identify the features of the correlation\nfunctions that are most susceptible to the differences between the two\nconstraints. Besides the density and director autocorrelations in both the\ntensorial and vectorial cases, we calculate also the density -- director\ncorrelation functions, the latter being a direct signature of the presence of a\nspecific constraint. Its amplitude is connected to the strength of the\nconstraint and is zero if none of the constraints is present, i.e., for a\nstandard non-polymeric nematic. Generally, the correlation functions with the\nconstraints differ substantially from the correlation functions in the\nnon-polymeric case, if the constraints are strong which in practice requires\nlong chains. Moreover, for the tensorial conservation law to be well\ndistinguishable from the vectorial one, the chain persistence length should be\nmuch smaller than the total length of the chain, so that hairpins (chain\nbackfolding) are numerous and the polar order is small.\n", "  We study meromorphic extensions of distance and tube zeta functions, as well\nas of geometric zeta functions of fractal strings. The distance zeta function\n$\\zeta_A(s):=\\int_{A_\\delta} d(x,A)^{s-N}\\mathrm{d}x$, where $\\delta>0$ is\nfixed and $d(x,A)$ denotes the Euclidean distance from $x$ to $A$ extends the\ndefinition of the zeta function associated with bounded fractal strings to\narbitrary bounded subsets $A$ of $\\mathbb{R}^N$. The abscissa of Lebesgue\nconvergence $D(\\zeta_A)$ coincides with $D:=\\overline\\dim_BA$, the upper box\ndimension of $A$. The complex dimensions of $A$ are the poles of the\nmeromorphic continuation of the fractal zeta function of $A$ to a suitable\nconnected neighborhood of the \"critical line\" $\\{\\Re(s)=D\\}$. We establish\nseveral meromorphic extension results, assuming some suitable information about\nthe second term of the asymptotic expansion of the tube function $|A_t|$ as\n$t\\to0^+$, where $A_t$ is the Euclidean $t$-neighborhood of $A$. We pay\nparticular attention to a class of Minkowski measurable sets, such that\n$|A_t|=t^{N-D}(\\mathcal M+O(t^\\gamma))$ as $t\\to0^+$, with $\\gamma>0$, and to a\nclass of Minkowski nonmeasurable sets, such that $|A_t|=t^{N-D}(G(\\log\nt^{-1})+O(t^\\gamma))$ as $t\\to0^+$, where $G$ is a nonconstant periodic\nfunction and $\\gamma>0$. In both cases, we show that $\\zeta_A$ can be\nmeromorphically extended (at least) to the open right half-plane\n$\\{\\Re(s)>D-\\gamma\\}$. Furthermore, up to a multiplicative constant, the\nresidue of $\\zeta_A$ evaluated at $s=D$ is shown to be equal to $\\mathcal M$\n(the Minkowski content of $A$) and to the mean value of $G$ (the average\nMinkowski content of $A$), respectively. Moreover, we construct a class of\nfractal strings with principal complex dimensions of any prescribed order, as\nwell as with an infinite number of essential singularities on the critical line\n$\\{\\Re(s)=D\\}$.\n", "  The production of $J/\\psi$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV is studied with the \\lhcb detector.\nCross-section measurements are performed as a function of the transverse\nmomentum $p_\\mathrm{T}$ and the rapidity $y$ of the $J/\\psi$ meson in the\nregion $p_\\mathrm{T}<14\\mathrm{GeV}/c$ and $2.0<y<4.5$, for both prompt\n$J/\\psi$ mesons and $J/\\psi$ mesons from $b$-hadron decays. The production\ncross-sections integrated over the kinematic coverage are $15.03\\pm 0.03\\pm\n0.94$ $\\mu$b for prompt $J/\\psi$ and $2.25\\pm 0.01\\pm 0.14$ $\\mu$b for $J/\\psi$\nfrom $b$-hadron decays, assuming zero polarization of the $J/\\psi$ meson. The\nfirst uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. The\ncross-section reported for $J/\\psi$ mesons from $b$-hadron decays is used to\nextrapolate to a total $b\\bar{b}$ cross-section. The ratios of the\ncross-sections with respect to $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV are also determined.\n", "  We study fractality of unbounded sets of finite Lebesgue measure at infinity\nby introducing the notions of Minkowski dimension and content at infinity. We\nalso introduce the Lapidus zeta function at infinity, study its properties and\ndemonstrate its use in analysis of fractal properties of unbounded sets at\ninfinity.\n", "  Although qubits are the leading candidate for the basic elements in a quantum\ncomputer, there are also a range of reasons to consider using higher\ndimensional qudits or quantum continuous variables (QCVs). In this paper we use\na general `quantum variable' formalism to propose a method of quantum\ncomputation in which ancillas are used to mediate gates on a well-isolated\n`quantum memory' register and which may be applied to the setting of qubits,\nqudits (for $d>2$) or QCVs. More specifically, we present a model in which\nuniversal quantum computation may be implemented on a register using only:\nrepeated applications of a single fixed two-body ancilla-register interaction\ngate, ancillas prepared in a single state, and local measurements of these\nancillas. In order to maintain determinism in the computation, adaptive\nmeasurements via a classical-feedforward of measurement outcomes are used, with\nthe method similar to that in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). We\nshow that our model has the same hybrid quantum-classical processing advantages\nas MBQC, including the power to implement any Clifford circuit in essentially\none layer of quantum computation. In some physical settings, high-quality\nmeasurements of the ancillas may be highly challenging or not possible, and\nhence we also present a globally unitary model which replaces the need for\nmeasurements of the ancillas with the requirement for ancillas to be prepared\nin states from a fixed orthonormal basis. Finally, we discuss settings in which\nthese models may be of practical interest.\n", "  We propose a new type of axion inflation with complex structure moduli in the\nframework of type IIB superstring theory compactified on Calabi-Yau manifold.\nThe inflaton is identified as the axion for the complex structure moduli whose\npotential is originating from instantonic corrections appearing through the\nperiod vector of mirror Calabi-Yau manifold. The axionic shift symmetry is\nbroken down to the discrete one by the inclusion of instantonic correction and\ncertain three-from fluxes. Our proposed inflation scenario is compatible with\nK\\\"ahler moduli stabilization. We also study a typical reheating temperature in\nthe case of complex structure moduli inflation.\n", "  Scaling properties of time series are usually studied in terms of the scaling\nlaws of empirical moments, which are the time average estimates of moments of\nthe dynamic variable. Nonlinearities in the scaling function of empirical\nmoments are generally regarded as a sign of multifractality in the data. We\nshow that, except for the Brownian motion, this method fails to disclose the\ncorrect monofractal nature of self-similar L\\'evy processes. We prove that for\nthis class of processes it produces apparent multifractality characterised by a\npiecewise-linear scaling function with two different regimes, which match at\nthe stability index of the considered process. This result is motivated by\nprevious numerical evidence. It is obtained by introducing an appropriate\nstochastic normalisation which is able to cure empirical moments, without\nhiding their dependence on time, when moments they aim at estimating do not\nexist.\n", "  Despite a large experimental effort, so far no evidence for flavour-violating\ndecays of charged leptons such as $l_i\\to l_j\\gamma$ and $l_i\\to l_j l_k l_k$\nhas been found. The absence of a signal puts very severe constraints on many\nextensions of the Standard Model. Here we apply a model independent approach by\nstudying such decays in the Standard Model effective field theory. Going beyond\nleading order in the Standard Model couplings and considering all dimension 6\noperators that might lead to lepton-flavour violation, we are able to extract\nlimits on a large number of Wilson coefficients of such operators. We are also\nable to compare the impact of particular searches and find, for example, that\nflavour-violating decays of the $Z$-boson $Z\\to \\mu e$ are much more\nconstrained from low-energy experiments $\\mu\\to e \\gamma$ than from the limits\nof current and future direct searches at high energy.\n", "  The study of the top quark properties will be an integral part of any\nparticle physics activity at future leptonic colliders. In this proceeding we\ndiscuss the possibility of testing composite Higgs scenarios at $e^+e^-$\nprototypes through deviations from the Standard Model predictions in $t\\bar t$\nproduction observables for various centre of mass energies, ranging from 370\nGeV up to 1 TeV. This proceedings draws from Ref. arXiv:1504.05407\n", "  Quantum correlations and coherence generated between two free spinless\nparticles in the lattice, interacting with a common quantum phonon bath, are\nstudied. The reduced density matrix is solved using the Markov approach. We\nshow that the bath induces correlations between the particles. The coherence\ninduced by the bath is studied, calculating off-diagonal elements of the\ndensity matrix, spatiotemporal dispersion, purity and quantum mutual\ninformation. We find a characteristic time-scale pointing out when this\ncoherence is maximum. In addition, a Wigner-like distribution in the\nphase-space (lattice) is introduced as an indirect indicator of the quantumness\nof total correlations and coherence induced by the thermal bath. The negative\nvolume of the Wigner function also shows a behavior which is in agreement with\nthe time-scale that we have found. A Gaussian distribution for the profile of\nparticles is not obtained, and interference patterns are observed as the result\nof bath-induced coherence. As the temperature of the bath vanishes, the\nballistic behavior of the tight-binding model is recovered. The geometric\nquantum discord is calculated, to characterize the nature of the correlations.\n", "  This paper presents an optimal control-based inverse method used to determine\nthe distribution of the electrodes for the electroosmotic micromixers with\nexternal driven flow from the inlet. Based on the optimal control method, one\nDirichlet boundary control problem is constructed to inversely find the optimal\ndistribution of the electrodes on the sidewalls of electroosmotic micromixers\nand achieve the acceptable mixing performance. After solving the boundary\ncontrol problem, the step-shaped distribution of the external electric\npotential imposed on the sidewalls can be obtained and the distribution of\nelectrodes can be inversely determined according to the obtained external\nelectric potential. Numerical results are also provided to demonstrate the\neffectivity of the proposed method.\n", "  We explore the implications of the conservation law(s) and the corresponding\n\"continuity equation(s)\", resulting from the coupling between the positional\nand the orientational order in main-chain polymer nematics, by showing that the\nvectorial and tensorial forms of these equations are in general not equivalent\nand can not be reduced to one another, but neither are they disjoint\nalternatives. We analyze the relation between them and elucidate the\nfundamental role that the chain backfolding plays in the determination of their\nrelative strength and importance. Finally, we show that the correct penalty\npotential in the effective free energy, implementing these conservation laws,\nshould actually connect both the tensorial and the vectorial constraints. We\nshow that the consequences of the polymer chains connectivity for their\nconsistent mesoscopic description are thus not only highly non-trivial but that\nits proper implementation is absolutely crucial for a consistent coarse grained\ndescription of the main-chain polymer nematics.\n", "  In this paper, we study gravitational-wave (GW) emission from a hypothetical\nsupermassive black-hole (SMBH) binary at the center of M87. The existence of a\nSMBH other than that usually identified with the central AGN is a possible\nexplanation for the observed displacement ($\\sim O(1)~{\\rm pc}$) between the\nAGN and the galactic centroid, and it is reasonable to assume consid- ering the\nevolution of SMBHs through galaxy mergers. Because the period of the binary and\nthe resulting GWs is much longer than the observational time span, we calculate\nthe variation of the GW amplitude, rather than the amplitude itself. We\ninvestigate the dependence on the orbital elements and the second BH mass\ntaking the observational constraints into account. The frequency of the GWs is\ntoo low to be detected with the conventional pulsar timing array and we propose\na new method to detect such low-frequency GWs with the distribution func- tion\nof pulsar spin-down rates. Although the GWs from a SMBH binary which explains\nthe observed displacement is extremely hard to be detected even with the new\nmethod, GWs are still a useful way to probe the M87 center.\n", "  We use local Hamiltonian torus actions to degenerate a symplectic manifold to\na normal crossings symplectic variety in a smooth one-parameter family. This\nconstruction, motivated in part by the Gross-Siebert and B. Parker's programs,\ncontains a multifold version of the usual (two-fold) symplectic cut\nconstruction and in particular splits a symplectic manifold into several\nsymplectic manifolds containing normal crossings symplectic divisors with\nshared irreducible components in one step.\n", "  Within a conventional Hamiltonian description, we find accurate closed-form\nexpressions for the oscillation probabilities of three coupled neutrinos\npropagating in matter. Subtle cancelations that occur in coefficients of our\nformulation are avoided for all transitions $\\nu_a \\to \\nu_b$ by transforming\nto a different set of coefficients presented in an appendix of this paper. The\nneutrino mass eigenvalues are easily obtained numerically as the solution of a\ncubic equation. Our methods are illustrated for flavor-changing transitions in\nthe $(\\nu_e,\\nu_\\mu)$ sector. The resulting analytic expressions oscillation\nprobabilities, which are particularly simple, are also accurate to a few\npercent over all regions of interest at present and the envisioned future\nneutrino facilities. While somewhat less accurate than numerical simulations,\nour approximate expressions are sufficiently accuracy to obviate the need for\nexact computer simulations in many circumstances.\n", "  Optical re-brightenings in the afterglows of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are\nunexpected within the framework of the simple external shock model. While it\nhas been suggested that the central engines of some GRBs are newly born\nmagnetars, we aim to relate the behaviors of magnetars to the optical\nre-brightenings. A newly born magnetar will lose its rotational energy in the\nform of Poynting-flux, which may be converted into a wind of electron-positron\npairs through some magnetic dissipation processes. As proposed by Dai (2004),\nthis wind will catch up with the GRB outflow and a long-lasting reverse shock\nwould form. By applying this scenario to GRB afterglows, we find that the\nreverse shock propagating back into the electron-positron wind can lead to an\nobservable optical re-brightening and a simultaneous X-ray plateau (or X-ray\nshallow decay). In our study, we select four GRBs, i.e., GRB 080413B, GRB\n090426, GRB 091029, and GRB 100814A, of which the optical afterglows are well\nobserved and show clear re-brightenings. We find that they can be well\ninterpreted. In our scenario, the spin-down timescale of the magnetar should be\nslightly smaller than the peak time of the re-brightening, which can provide a\nclue to the characteristics of the magnetar.\n", "  A deep connection has been recently established between soft theorems and\nsymmetries at null infinity in gravity and gauge theories, recasting the former\nas Ward identities of the latter. In particular, different orders (in the\nfrequency of the soft particle) in the soft theorems are believed to be\ncontrolled by different asymptotic symmetries. In this paper we argue that this\nneeds not be the case by focusing on the soft photon theorem. We argue that the\nsub-leading soft factor follows from the same symmetry responsible for the\nleading one, namely certain residual (large) gauge transformations of the gauge\ntheory. In particular, expanding the associated charge in inverse powers of the\nradial coordinate, the (sub-)leading charge yields the (sub-)leading soft\nfactor.\n", "  In this paper, we study in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe the\ninteraction between the viscous generalized Chaplygin gas with $f(R,T)$\ngravity, which is an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace\n$T$ of the energy-momentum tensor. Assuming that the contents of universe is\ndominated by a generalized Chaplygin gas and dark energy, we obtained the\nmodified Friedmann equations and also the time dependent energy density and\npressure of dark energy due to the shear and bulk viscosities for three\ninteracting models depending on an input parameter $Q$. Within the simple form\nof scale factor (power-law), we discuss the graphical representation of dark\nenergy density parameter and investigate the shear and bulk viscosities effects\non the accelerating expansion of the universe for each interacting model.\n", "  Motivated by recent pump-probe experiments indicating enhanced coherent\n$c$-axis transport in underdoped YBCO, we study Josephson junctions\nperiodically driven by optical pulses. We propose a mechanism for this\nobservation by demonstrating that a parametrically driven Josephson junction\nshows an enhanced imaginary part of the low-frequency conductivity when the\ndriving frequency is above the plasma frequency, implying an effectively\nenhanced Josephson coupling. We generalize this analysis to a bilayer system of\nJosephson junctions modeling YBCO. Again, the Josephson coupling is enhanced\nwhen the pump frequency is blue-detuned to either of the two plasma frequencies\nof the material. We show that the emergent driven state is a genuine,\nnon-equilibrium superconducting state, in which equilibrium relations between\nthe Josephson coupling, current fluctuations, and the critical current no\nlonger hold.\n", "  The goal of this report is to summarize the current situation and discuss\npossible search strategies for charged scalars, in non-supersymmetric\nextensions of the Standard Model at the LHC. Such scalars appear in\nMulti-Higgs-Doublet models (MHDM), in particular in the popular\nTwo-Higgs-Doublet model (2HDM), allowing for charged and additional neutral\nHiggs bosons. These models have the attractive property that electroweak\nprecision observables are automatically in agreement with the Standard Model at\nthe tree level. For the most popular version of this framework, Model~II, a\ndiscovery of a charged Higgs boson remains challenging, since the parameter\nspace is becoming very constrained, and the QCD background is very high. We\nalso briefly comment on models with dark matter which constrain the\ncorresponding charged scalars that occur in these models. The stakes of a\npossible discovery of an extended scalar sector are very high, and these\nsearches should be pursued in all conceivable channels, at the LHC and at\nfuture colliders.\n", "  We study the conditions in which we could bring a universe filled with\ndifferent $Z_3$ vacua created during the Next to Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (NMSSM) electroweak symmetry breaking at $\\textit{O} (10)^2$ GeV\nand a three dimensional three states diluted Potts model together in the same\nuniversality class. Then we use Cardy-Jacobsen conjecture to prove that there\nmight be a tri-critical point in the NMSSM electroweak epoch of early universe.\nWe prove that due to the existence of this point there would be no cosmological\ndomain wall problem. Moreover, at this point the heat capacity and correlation\nlength diverge which lead to a huge amount of energy release at constant\ntemperature and a new mechanism for cosmological structure formation. Also, the\nentropy decrease after the tri-critical phase transition could explain the\nproblem of low initial entropy in early universe. Finally, we combine\nCardy-Jacobsen and Yaffe-Svetitsky conjectures to show that there might be a\ntri-critical point for the $Z_3$ center symmetry breaking in a pure SU(3)\ntheory at $\\textit{O} (10)^2$ MeV. Near the pure SU(3) tri-critical point,\nunlike the electroweak epoch tri-critical point, entropy increases rather than\ndecrease.\n", "  The Giardin\\`a-Kurchan-Peliti algorithm is a numerical procedure that uses\npopulation dynamics in order to calculate large deviation functions associated\nto the distribution of time-averaged observables. To study the numerical errors\nof this algorithm, we explicitly devise a stochastic birth-death process that\ndescribes the time evolution of the population probability. From this\nformulation, we derive that systematic errors of the algorithm decrease\nproportionally to the inverse of the population size. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a simple interpolation technique for the better\nestimation of large deviation functions. The approach we present is detailed\nexplicitly in a two-state model.\n", "  Counter-diabatic driving protocols were proposed as a means to do fast\nchanges in the Hamiltonian without exciting transitions. Such driving in\nprinciple allows one to realize arbitrarily fast annealing protocols or\nimplement fast dissipationless driving, circumventing standard adiabatic\nlimitations requiring infinitesimally slow rates. These ideas were tested and\nused both experimentally and theoretically in small systems, but in larger\nchaotic systems it is known that exact counter-diabatic protocols do not exist.\nIn this work we develop a simple variational approach allowing one to find best\npossible counter-diabatic protocols given physical constraints like locality.\nThese protocols are easy to derive and implement both experimentally and\nnumerically. We show that, using these approximate protocols, one can\ndrastically decrease dissipation and increase fidelity of quantum annealing\nprotocols in complex many-particle systems. In the fast limit these protocols\nprovide an effective dual description of adiabatic dynamics where the coupling\nconstant plays the role of time and the counter-diabatic term plays the role of\nthe Hamiltonian.\n", "  Control of physical property in terms of external fields is essential for\ncontemporary technologies. The conductance can be controlled by a gate electric\nfield in a field effect transistor, which is a main component of the integrated\ncircuit. Optical phenomena induced by an electric field such as\nelectroluminescence and electrochromism are useful for display and other\ntechnologies. Control of microwave propagation seems also imperative for future\nwireless communication technology. Microwave properties in solids are dominated\nmostly by magnetic excitations, which cannot be easily controlled by an\nelectric field. One of the solutions for this problem is utilizing magnetically\ninduced ferroelectrics (multiferroics). Here we show that microwave\nnonreciprocity, which is difference between oppositely propagating microwaves,\ncan be reversed by the external electric field in a multiferroic helimagnet\nBa$_2$Mg$_2$Fe$_{12}$O$_{22}$. This result offers a new avenue for the\nelectrical control of microwave properties.\n", "  We characterize numerically and analytically the signatures of the spin-orbit\ninteraction in a two-electron GaAs double quantum dot in the presence of an\nexternal magnetic field. In particular, we obtain the return probability of the\nsinglet state by simulating Landau-Zener voltage detuning sweeps which traverse\nthe singlet-triplet ($S-T_+$) resonance. Our results indicate that\nnon-spin-conserving interdot tunneling processes arising from the spin-orbit\ninteraction have well defined signatures. These allow direct access to the\nspin-orbit interaction scales and are characterized by a frequency shift and\nFourier amplitude modulation of the Rabi flopping dynamics of the\nsinglet-triplet qubits $S-T_0$ and $S-T_+$. By applying the Bloch-Feshbach\nprojection formalism, we demonstrate analytically that the aforementioned\neffects originate from the interplay between spin-orbit interaction and\nprocesses driven by the hyperfine interaction between the electron spins and\nthose of the GaAs nuclei.\n", "  The prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is characterized by rapid\nvariabilities, which may be a direct reflection of the unsteady central engine.\nWe perform a series of axisymmetric 2.5-dimensional simulations to study the\npropagation of relativistic, hydrodynamic, intermittent jets through the\nenvelope of a GRB progenitor star. A realistic rapidly rotating star is\nincorporated as the background of jet propagation, and the star is allowed to\ncollapse due to the gravity of the central black hole. By modeling the\nintermittent jets with constant-luminosity pulses with equal on and off\ndurations, we investigate how the half-period, $T$, affects the jet dynamics.\nFor relatively small $T$ values (e.g. 0.2 s), the jet breakout time $t_{\\rm\nbo}$ depends on the opening angle of the jet, with narrower jets more\npenetrating and reaching the surface at shorter times. For $T \\leq 1$ s, the\nreverse shock crosses each pulse before the jet penetrates through the stellar\nenvelope. As a result, after the breakout of the first group of pulses at\n$t_{\\rm bo}$, several subsequent pulses vanish before penetrating the star,\ncausing a quiescent gap. For larger half-periods ($T=2.0, 4.0$ s), all the\npulses can successfully penetrate through the envelope, since each pulse can\npropagate through the star before the reverse shock crosses the shell. Our\nresults may interpret the existence of a weak precursor in many long GRBs,\ngiven that the GRB central engine injects intermittent pulses with half-period\n$T \\leq 1$ s. The observational data seem to be consistent with such a\npossibility.\n", "  We study the dynamical properties of the quantum Rabi model within a\nsystematic expansion method. Based on the observation that the parity symmetry\nof the Rabi model is kept during the evolution of the states, we decompose the\ninitial state and the time-dependent one into a part of a positive and a\nnegative parity expanded by the superposition of the coherent states. The\nevolutions for the corresponding positive and the negative parity are obtained,\nwhere the expansion coefficients in the dynamical equations are known from the\nrecurrence relation derived.\n", "  Effective gravity and gauge fields are emergent properties intrinsic for\nlow-energy quasiparticles in topological semimetals. Here, taking two Dirac\nsemimetals as examples, we demonstrate that applied lattice strain can generate\nwarped spacetime, with fascinating analogues in astrophysics. Particularly, we\nstudy the possibility of simulating black-hole/white-hole event horizons and\ngravitational lensing effect. Furthermore, we discover strain-induced\ntopological phase transitions, both in the bulk materials and in their thin\nfilms. Especially in thin films, the transition between the quantum spin Hall\nand the trivial insulating phases can be achieved by a small strain, naturally\nleading to the proposition of a novel piezo-topological transistor device.\nPossible experimental realizations and analogue of Hawking radiation effect are\ndiscussed. Our result bridges multiple disciplines, revealing topological\nsemimetals as a unique table-top platform for exploring interesting phenomena\nin astrophysics and general relativity; it also suggests realistic materials\nand methods to achieve controlled topological phase transitions with great\npotential for device applications.\n", "  A 3.56-hour white dwarf (WD) - M dwarf (MD) close binary system, AR Scorpii,\nwas recently reported to show pulsating emission in radio, IR, optical, and UV,\nwith a 1.97-minute period, which suggests the existence of a WD with a rotation\nperiod of 1.95 minutes. We propose a model to explain the temporal and spectral\ncharacteristics of the system. The WD is a nearly perpendicular rotator, with\nboth open field line beams sweeping the MD stellar wind periodically. A bow\nshock propagating into the stellar wind accelerates electrons in the wind.\nSynchrotron radiation of these shocked electrons can naturally account for the\nbroad-band (from radio to X-rays) spectral energy distribution of the system.\n", "  We give a non-perturbative construction of a distinguished state for the\nquantized Dirac field in Minkowski space in the presence of a time-dependent\nexternal field of the form of a plane electromagnetic wave. By explicit\ncomputation of the fermionic signature operator, it is shown that the Dirac\noperator has the strong mass oscillation property. We prove that the resulting\nfermionic projector state is a Hadamard state.\n", "  We set up a general density-operator approach to geometric steady-state\npumping through slowly driven open quantum systems. This approach applies to\nstrongly interacting systems that are weakly coupled to multiple reservoirs at\nhigh temperature, illustrated by an Anderson quantum dot, but shows potential\nfor generalization. Pumping gives rise to a nonadiabatic geometric phase that\ncan be described by a framework originally developed for classical dissipative\nsystems by Landsberg. This geometric phase is accumulated by the transported\nobservable (charge, spin, energy) and not by the quantum state. It thus differs\nradically from the adiabatic Berry-Simon phase, even when generalizing it to\nmixed states, following Sarandy and Lidar. Importantly, our geometric\nformulation of pumping stays close to a direct physical intuition (i) by tying\ngauge transformations to calibration of the meter registering the transported\nobservable and (ii) by deriving a geometric connection from a driving-frequency\nexpansion of the current. Our approach provides a systematic and efficient way\nto compute the geometric pumping of various observables, including charge,\nspin, energy and heat. Our geometric curvature formula reveals a general\nexperimental scheme for performing geometric transport spectroscopy that\nenhances standard nonlinear spectroscopies based on measurements for static\nparameters. We indicate measurement strategies for separating the useful\ngeometric pumping contribution to transport from nongeometric effects. Finally,\nwe highlight several advantages of our approach in an exhaustive comparison\nwith the Sinitsyn-Nemenmann full-counting statistics (FCS) approach to\ngeometric pumping of an observable`s first moment. We explain how in the FCS\napproach an \"adiabatic\" approximation leads to a manifestly nonadiabatic result\ninvolving a finite retardation time of the response to parameter driving.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of quantum linear systems where\nthe input signals are multi-channel multi-photon states, namely states\ndetermined by a definite number of photons superposed in multiple input\nchannels. In contrast to most existing studies on separable input states in the\nliterature, we allow the existence of quantum correlation (for example quantum\nentanglement) in these multi-channel multi-photon input states. Due to the\nprevalence of quantum correlations in the quantum regime, the results presented\nin this paper are very general. Moreover, the multi-channel multi-photon states\nstudied here are reasonably mathematically tractable. Three types of\nmulti-photon states are considered: 1) $m$ photons superposed among $m$\nchannels, 2) $N$ photons superposed among $m$ channels where $N\\geq m$, and 3)\n$N$ photons superposed among $m$ channels where $N$ is an arbitrary positive\ninteger. Formulae for intensities and states of output fields are derived.\nExamples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results.\n", "  The nuclear modification factor RAA and the azimuthal anisotropy coefficient\nv[2] of prompt and nonprompt (i.e. those from decays of b hadrons) J/psi\nmesons, measured from PbPb and pp collisions at sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV at the\nLHC, are reported. The results are presented in several event centrality\nintervals and several kinematic regions, for transverse momenta pt > 6.5 GeV/c\nand rapidity abs(y) < 2.4, extending down to pt = 3 GeV/c in the 1.6 < abs(y) <\n2.4 range. The v[2] of prompt J/psi is found to be nonzero, but with no strong\ndependence on centrality, rapidity, or pt over the full kinematic range\nstudied. The measured v[2] of nonprompt J/psi is consistent with zero. The RAA\nof prompt J/psi exhibits a suppression that increases from peripheral to\ncentral collisions but does not vary as a function of either y or pt in the\nfiducial range. The nonprompt J/psi RAA shows a suppression which becomes\nstronger as rapidity or pt increase. The v[2] and nuclear suppression of open\nand hidden charm, and of open charm and beauty, are compared.\n", "  We study quantum effects of strong driving field applied to dissipative\nhybrid qubit-cavity system which are relevant for a realization of quantum\ngates in superconducting quantum metamaterials. We demonstrate that effects of\nstrong and non-stationary drivings have significantly quantum nature and can\nnot be treated by means of mean-field approximation. This is shown from a\ncomparison of steady state solution of the standard Maxwell-Bloch equations and\nnumerical solution of Lindblad equation on a density matrix. We show that\nmean-field approach provides very good agreement with the density matrix\nsolution at not very strong drivings $f<f^*$ but at $f>f^*$ a growing value of\nquantum correlations between fluctuations in qubit and photon sectors changes a\nbehavior of the system. We show that in regime of non-adiabatic switching on of\nthe driving such a quantum correlations influence a dynamics of qubit and\nphotons even at weak $f$.\n", "  Hard spheres are an important benchmark of our understanding of natural and\nsynthetic systems. In this work, colloidal experiments and Monte Carlo\nsimulations examine the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium assembly of hard\nspheres of diameter $\\sigma$ within cylinders of diameter $\\sigma\\leq D\\leq\n2.82\\sigma$. Although in such a system phase transitions formally do not exist,\nmarked structural crossovers are observed. In simulations, we find that the\nresulting pressure-diameter structural diagram echoes the densest packing\nsequence obtained at infinite pressure in this range of $D$. We also observe\nthat the out-of-equilibrium self-assembly depends on the compression rate. Slow\ncompression approximates equilibrium results, while fast compression can skip\nintermediate structures. Crossovers for which no continuous line-slip exists\nare found to be dynamically unfavorable, which is the source of this\ndifference. Results from colloidal sedimentation experiments at high P\\'eclet\nnumber are found to be consistent with the results of fast compressions, as\nlong as appropriate boundary conditions are used. The similitude between\ncompression and sedimentation results suggests that the assembly pathway does\nnot here sensitively depend on the nature of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics.\n", "  Measurements of jet activity in top-quark pair events produced in\nproton--proton collisions are presented, using 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision\ndata at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at\nthe Large Hadron Collider. Events are chosen by requiring an opposite-charge\n$e\\mu$ pair and two $b$-tagged jets in the final state. The normalised\ndifferential cross-sections of top-quark pair production are presented as\nfunctions of additional-jet multiplicity and transverse momentum, $p_{\\mathrm\nT}$. The fraction of signal events that do not contain additional jet activity\nin a given rapidity region, the gap fraction, is measured as a function of the\n$p_{\\mathrm T}$ threshold for additional jets, and is also presented for\ndifferent invariant mass regions of the $e\\mu b\\bar{b}$ system. All\nmeasurements are corrected for detector effects and presented as particle-level\ndistributions compared to predictions with different theoretical approaches for\nQCD radiation. While the kinematics of the jets from top-quark decays are\ndescribed well, the generators show differing levels of agreement with the\nmeasurements of observables that depend on the production of additional jets.\n", "  A search for new phenomena is performed in final states containing one or\nmore jets and an imbalance in transverse momentum in pp collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The analysed data sample, recorded with the\nCMS detector at the CERN LHC, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3\ninverse femtobarns. Several kinematic variables are employed to suppress the\ndominant background, multijet production, as well as to discriminate between\nother standard model and new physics processes. The search provides sensitivity\nto a broad range of new-physics models that yield a stable weakly interacting\nmassive particle. The number of observed candidate events is found to agree\nwith the expected contributions from standard model processes, and the result\nis interpreted in the mass parameter space of fourteen simplified\nsupersymmetric models that assume the pair production of gluinos or squarks and\na range of decay modes. For models that assume gluino pair production, masses\nup to 1575 and 975 GeV are excluded for gluinos and neutralinos, respectively.\nFor models involving the pair production of top squarks and compressed mass\nspectra, top squark masses up to 400 GeV are excluded.\n", "  We investigate the $\\eta'$ photoproduction off the nucleon with a particular\ninterest in the effect of the final-state interaction (FSI) of the $\\eta'$\nmeson and nucleon $(\\eta'N)$ based on three-flavor linear sigma model. We find\nan enhancement in the cross section of the $\\eta'$ photoproduction near the\n$\\eta'N$-threshold energy owing to the $\\eta'N$ FSI. With the $\\eta'$ meson at\nforward angles, the energy dependence near the $\\eta'N$ threshold is well\nreproduced with the $\\eta'N$ FSI. The cross section at backward angles can also\nbe a good probe to investigate the strength of the $\\eta'N$ interaction.\n", "  The results of a search for new physics in final states with photons and\nmissing transverse energy are reported. The study is based on a sample of\nproton-proton collisions collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with\nthe CMS detector in 2015, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3\ninverse femtobarns. Final states with two photons and significant missing\ntransverse energy are used to search for supersymmetric particles in models of\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) with general gauge-mediated (GGM) supersymmetry breaking.\nNo excess is observed with respect to the standard model expectation, and the\nresults are used to set limits on gluino pair production and squark pair\nproduction in the GGM SUSY framework. Gluino masses below 1.65 TeV and squark\nmasses below 1.37 TeV are excluded at a 95% confidence level.\n", "  The few-layer graphene quantum dot provides a promising platform for quantum\ncomputing with both spin and valley degrees of freedom. Gate-defined quantum\ndots in particular can avoid noise from edge disorders. In connection with the\nrecent experimental efforts [Y. Song et al., Nano Lett. 16, 6245 (2016)], we\ninvestigate the bound state properties of trilayer graphene (TLG) quantum dots\n(QDs) through numerical simulations. We show that the valley degeneracy can be\nlifted by breaking the time reversal symmetry through the application of a\nperpendicular magnetic field. The spectrum under such a potential exhibits a\ntransition from one group of Landau levels to the other group, which can be\nunderstood analytically through perturbation theory. Our results provide\ninsight to the transport property of TLG QDs, with possible applications to\nstudy of spin qubits and valleytronics in TLG QDs.\n", "  We review recent experiments on the Bose-Einstein condensation of photons in\na dye-filled optical microresonator. The most well-known example of a photon\ngas, photons in blackbody radiation, does not show Bose-Einstein condensation.\nInstead of massively populating the cavity ground mode, photons vanish in the\ncavity walls when they are cooled down. The situation is different in an\nultrashort optical cavity imprinting a low-frequency cutoff on the photon\nenergy spectrum that is well above the thermal energy. The latter allows for a\nthermalization process in which both temperature and photon number can be tuned\nindependently of each other or, correspondingly, for a non-vanishing photon\nchemical potential. We here describe experiments demonstrating the\nfluorescence-induced thermalization and Bose-Einstein condensation of a\ntwo-dimensional photon gas in the dye microcavity. Moreover, recent\nmeasurements on the photon statistics of the condensate, showing Bose-Einstein\ncondensation in the grandcanonical ensemble limit, will be reviewed.\n", "  We perform pulsed optically detected electron spin resonance to measure the\nDC magnetic field sensitivity and electronic spin coherence time T_2 of an\nensemble of near-surface, high-density nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers engineered\nto have a narrow magnetic resonance linewidth. Combining pulsed spectroscopy\nwith dynamic nuclear polarization, we obtain the photon-shot-noise-limited DC\nmagnetic sensitivity of 35 nT Hz^{-0.5}. We find that T_2 is controlled by\ninstantaneous diffusion, enabling decoherence spectroscopy on residual nitrogen\nimpurity spins in the diamond lattice and a quantitative determination of their\ndensity. The demonstrated high DC magnetic sensitivity and decoherence\nspectroscopy are expected to broaden the application range for two-dimensional\nmagnetic imaging.\n", "  The interpretation of nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM) experiments is\nclouded by large theoretical uncertainties associated with nonperturbative\nmatrix elements. In various beyond-the-Standard Model scenarios nuclear and\ndiamagnetic atomic EDMs are expected to be dominated by CP-violating\npion-nucleon interactions that arise from quark chromo-electric dipole moments.\nThe corresponding CP-violating pion-nucleon coupling strengths are, however,\npoorly known. In this work we propose a strategy to calculate these couplings\nby using spectroscopic lattice QCD techniques. Instead of directly calculating\nthe pion-nucleon coupling constants, a challenging task, we use chiral symmetry\nrelations that link the pion-nucleon couplings to nucleon sigma terms and mass\nsplittings that are significantly easier to calculate. In this work, we show\nthat these relations are reliable up to next-to-next-to-leading order in the\nchiral expansion in both SU(2) and SU(3) chiral perturbation theory. We\nconclude with a brief discussion about practical details regarding the required\nlattice QCD calculations and the phenomenological impact of an improved\nunderstanding of CP-violating matrix elements.\n", "  In 2009, Banados, Silk and West (BSW) pointed out the possibility of having\nan unbounded limit of centre-of-mass collision energy for test particles in the\nfield of an extremal Kerr black hole, if one of them has fine-tuned parameters\nand the collision point is approaching the horizon. The possibility of this\n\"BSW effect\" attracted much attention: it was generalised to arbitrary\n(\"dirty\") rotating black holes and an analogy was found for collisions of\ncharged particles in the field of non-rotating charged black holes. Our work\nconsiders the unification of these two mechanisms, which have so far been\nstudied only separately. Exploring the enlarged parameter space, we find\nkinematic restrictions that may prevent the fine-tuned particles from reaching\nthe limiting collision point. These restrictions are first presented in a\ngeneral form, which can be used with an arbitrary black-hole model, and then\nvisualised for the Kerr-Newman solution by plotting the \"admissible region\" in\nthe parameter space of critical particles, reproducing some known results and\nobtaining a number of new ones. For example, we find that (marginally) bounded\ncritical particles with enormous values of angular momentum can, curiously\nenough, approach the degenerate horizon, if the charge of the black hole is\nvery small. Such \"mega-BSW\" behaviour is excluded in the case of a vacuum black\nhole, or a black hole with large charge. It may be interesting in connection\nwith the small \"Wald charge\" induced on rotating black holes in external\nmagnetic fields.\n", "  We present charged-particle distributions sensitive to the underlying event,\nmeasured by the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass\nenergy of 13 TeV, in low-luminosity Large Hadron Collider fills corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of 1.6 nb$^{-1}$. The distributions were\nconstructed using charged particles with absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.5\nand with transverse momentum greater than 500 MeV, in events with at least one\nsuch charged particle with transverse momentum above 1 GeV. These distributions\ncharacterise the angular distribution of energy and particle flows with respect\nto the charged particle with highest transverse momentum, as a function of both\nthat momentum and of charged-particle multiplicity. The results have been\ncorrected for detector effects and are compared to the predictions of various\nMonte Carlo event generators, experimentally establishing the level of\nunderlying-event activity at LHC Run 2 energies and providing inputs for the\ndevelopment of event generator modelling. The current models in use for UE\nmodelling typically describe this data to 5% accuracy, compared with data\nuncertainties of less than 1%.\n", "  We report a detailed small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) study of the\nskyrmion lattice phase of MnSi under compressive and tensile strain. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that tensile strain applied in the skyrmion lattice\nplane, perpendicular to the magnetic field, acts to destabilize the skyrmion\nlattice phase. This experiment was enabled by our development of a versatile\nstrain cell, unique in its ability to select the application of either tensile\nor compressive strain in-situ by using two independent helium-actuated copper\npressure transducers, whose design has been optimized for magnetic SANS on\nmodulated long-period magnetic structures and vortex lattices, and is compact\nenough to fit in common sample environments, such as cryostats and\nsuperconducting magnets.\n", "  We introduce a new technique for determining x-ray fluorescence line energies\nand widths, and we present measurements made with this technique of 22 x-ray L\nlines from lanthanide-series elements. The technique uses arrays of\ntransition-edge sensors, microcalorimeters with high energy-resolving power\nthat simultaneously observe both calibrated x-ray standards and the x-ray\nemission lines under study. The uncertainty in absolute line energies is\ngenerally less than 0.4 eV in the energy range of 4.5 keV to 7.5 keV. Of the\nseventeen line energies of neodymium, samarium, and holmium, thirteen are found\nto be consistent with the available x-ray reference data measured after 1990;\nonly two of the four lines for which reference data predate 1980, however, are\nconsistent with our results. Five lines of terbium are measured with\nuncertainties that improve on those of existing data by factors of two or more.\nThese results eliminate a significant discrepancy between measured and\ncalculated x-ray line energies for the terbium Ll line (5.551 keV). The line\nwidths are also measured, with uncertainties of 0.6 eV or less on the\nfull-width at half-maximum in most cases. These measurements were made with an\narray of approximately one hundred superconducting x- ray microcalorimeters,\neach sensitive to an energy band from 1 keV to 8 keV. No energy-dispersive\nspectrometer has previously been used for absolute-energy estimation at this\nlevel of accuracy. Future spectrometers, with superior linearity and energy\nresolution, will allow us to improve on these results and expand the\nmeasurements to more elements and a wider range of line energies.\n", "  This paper reports the measurement of J/psi meson production in proton-proton\n(pp) and proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon\npair of 5.02 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The data samples used in the\nanalysis correspond to integrated luminosities of 28 inverse picobarns and 35\ninverse nanobarns for pp and pPb collisions, respectively. Prompt and nonprompt\nJ/psi mesons, the latter produced from the decay of B mesons, are measured in\ntheir dimuon decay channels. Differential cross sections are measured in the\ntransverse momentum range of 2 < pt < 30 GeV/c, and center-of-mass rapidity\nranges of abs(y[CM]) < 2.4 (pp) and -2.87 < y[CM] < 1.93 (pPb). The nuclear\nmodification factor, R[pPb], is measured as functions of both pt and y[CM].\nSmall modifications of the J/psi cross sections are observed in pPb relative to\npp collisions. The ratio of J/psi production cross sections in p-going and\nPb-going directions, R[FB], studied as functions of pt and y[CM], shows a\nsignificant decrease for increasing transverse energy deposited at large\npseudorapidities. These results, which cover a wide kinematic range, provide\nnew insight on the role of cold nuclear matter effects on prompt and nonprompt\nJ/psi production.\n", "  Recent work has confirmed that the masses of supermassive black holes,\nestimated from scaling relations with global properties such as the stellar\nmasses of their host galaxies, may be biased high. Much of this may be caused\nby the requirement that the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole\nmust be resolved for the black-hole mass to be reliably estimated. We revisit\nthis issue by using a comprehensive galaxy evolution semi-analytic model, which\nself-consistently evolves supermassive black holes from high-redshift seeds via\ngas accretion and mergers, and also includes AGN feedback. Once tuned to\nreproduce the (mean) correlation of black-hole mass with velocity dispersion,\nthe model is unable to also account for the correlation with stellar mass. This\nbehaviour is independent of the model's parameters, thus suggesting an internal\ninconsistency in the data. The predicted distributions, especially at the\nlow-mass end, are also much broader than observed. However, if selection\neffects are included, the model's predictions tend to align with the\nobservations. We also demonstrate that the correlations between the residuals\nof the local scaling relations are more effective than the scaling relations\nthemselves at constraining AGN feedback models. In fact, we find that our\nsemi-analytic model, while in apparent broad agreement with the scaling\nrelations when accounting for selection biases, yields very weak correlations\nbetween their residuals at fixed stellar mass, in stark contrast with\nobservations. This problem persists when changing the AGN feedback strength,\nand is also present in the $z\\sim 0$ outputs of the hydrodynamic cosmological\nsimulation Horizon-AGN, which includes state-of-the-art treatments of AGN\nfeedback. This suggests that current AGN feedback models may be too weak or are\nsimply not capturing the effect of the black hole on the stellar velocity\ndispersion.\n", "  A variety of new and interesting correlated states have been predicted in\ngraphene monolayer doped to Van Hove singularities (VHSs) of its\ndensity-of-state (DOS). However, tuning the Fermi energy to reach a VHS of\ngraphene by either gating or chemical doping is prohibitively difficult, owning\nto their large energy distance (3 eV). Therefore, these correlated states,\nwhich arise from effects of strong electron-electron interactions at the VHSs,\nhave remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report experimental evidences of\nelectron-electron interactions around the VHSs of a twisted bilayer graphene\n(TBG) through scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. By introducing a\nsmall twisted angle between two adjacent graphene sheets, we are able to\ngenerate low-energy VHSs arbitrarily approaching the Fermi energy. The split of\nthe VHSs are observed and the symmetry breaking of electronic states around the\nVHSs are directly visualized. These results experimentally demonstrate the\nimportant effects of electron-electron interactions on electronic properties\naround the VHSs of the TBG, therefore providing motivation for further\ntheoretical and experimental studies in graphene systems with considering\nmany-body interactions.\n", "  This work introduces a novel reinterpretation of structured illumination (SI)\nmicroscopy for coherent imaging that allows three-dimensional imaging of\ncomplex refractive index (RI). To do so, we show that coherent SI is\nmathematically equivalent to a superposition of angled illuminations. It\nfollows that raw acquisitions for standard SI-enhanced quantitative-phase\nimages can be processed into complex electric-field maps describing sample\ndiffraction under angled illuminations. Standard diffraction tomography (DT)\ncomputation can then be used to reconstruct the sample 3D RI distribution at\nsub-diffraction resolutions. We demonstrate this concept by using a\nSI-quantitative-phase imaging system to computationally reconstruct 3D RI\ndistributions of human breast (MCF-7) and colorectal (HT-29) adenocarcinoma\ncells. Our experimental setup uses a spatial light modulator to generate\nstructured patterns at the sample and collects angle-dependent sample\ndiffraction using a common-path, off-axis interference configuration with no\nmoving components. Furthermore, this technique holds promise for easy pairing\nwith SI fluorescence microscopy, and important future extensions may include\nmultimodal, sub-diffraction resolution, 3D RI and fluorescent visualizations.\n", "  The tracking performance parameters of the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker\n(TRT) as part of the ATLAS inner detector are described in this paper for\ndifferent data-taking conditions in proton-proton, proton-lead and lead-lead\ncollisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The performance is studied using\ndata collected during the first period of LHC operation (Run 1) and is compared\nwith Monte Carlo simulations. The performance of the TRT, operating with two\ndifferent gas mixtures (xenon-based and argon-based) and its dependence on the\nTRT occupancy is presented. These studies show that the tracking performance of\nthe TRT is similar for the two gas mixtures and that a significant contribution\nto the particle momentum resolution is made by the TRT up to high particle\ndensities.\n", "  The ensemble properties and time-averaged observables of a memory-induced\ndiffusive-superdiffusive transition are studied. The model consists in a random\nwalker whose transitions in a given direction depend on a weighted linear\ncombination of the number of both right and left previous transitions. The\ndiffusion process is nonstationary and its probability develops the phenomenon\nof aging. Depending on the characteristic memory parameters, the ensemble\nbehavior may be normal, superdiffusive, or ballistic. In contrast, the\ntime-averaged mean squared displacement is equal to that of a normal undriven\nrandom walk, which renders the process non-ergodic. In addition, and similarly\nto Levy walks [Godec and Metzler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 020603 (2013)], for\ntrajectories of finite duration the time-averaged displacement apparently\nbecome random with properties that depend on the measurement time and also on\nthe memory properties. These features are related to the non-stationary\npower-law decay of the transition probabilities to their stationary values.\nTime-averaged response to a bias is also calculated. In contrast with Levy\nwalks [Froemberg and Barkai, Phys. Rev. E 87, 030104(R) (2013)], the response\nalways vanishes asymptotically.\n", "  The beyond-generalized Proca theories are the extension of second-order\nmassive vector-tensor theories (dubbed generalized Proca theories) with two\ntransverse vector modes and one longitudinal scalar besides two tensor\npolarizations. Even with this extension, the propagating degrees of freedom\nremain unchanged on the isotropic cosmological background without an\nOstrogradski instability. We study the cosmology in beyond-generalized Proca\ntheories by paying particular attention to the dynamics of late-time cosmic\nacceleration and resulting observational consequences. We derive conditions for\navoiding ghosts and instabilities of tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations\nand discuss viable parameter spaces in concrete models allowing the dark energy\nequation of state smaller than $-1$. The propagation speeds of those\nperturbations are subject to modifications beyond the domain of generalized\nProca theories. There is a mixing between scalar and matter sound speeds, but\nsuch a mixing is suppressed during most of the cosmic expansion history without\ncausing a new instability. On the other hand, we find that derivative\ninteractions arising in beyond-generalized Proca theories give rise to\nimportant modifications to the cosmic growth history. The growth rate of matter\nperturbations can be compatible with the redshift-space distortion data due to\nthe realization of gravitational interaction weaker than that in generalized\nProca theories. Thus, it is possible to distinguish the dark energy model in\nbeyond-generalized Proca theories from the counterpart in generalized Proca\ntheories as well as from the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  A smartphone fluorimeter capable of time-based fluorescence intensity\nmeasurements at various temperatures is reported. Excitation is provided by an\nintegrated UV LED (370 nm) and detection obtained using the in-built CMOS\ncamera. A Peltier is integrated to allow measurements of the intensity over T =\n10 to 40 C with a maximum temperature resolution of DELTA T ~ 0.1 C. All\ncomponents are controlled using a smartphone battery powered Arduino\nmicrocontroller and a customised Android application that allows sequential\nfluorescence imaging and quantification every DELTA t = 4 seconds. The\ntemperature dependence of fluorescence intensity for four emitters (Rhodamine\nB, Rhodamine 6G, 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin and\n6-(1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane)2-ethyl-naphthalimide) are characterised.\nThe normalised fluorescence intensity over time of the latter chemosensor dye\ncomplex in the presence of Zn ion is observed to accelerate with an increasing\nrate constant, k = 1.94 min-1 at T = 15 C and k = 3.64 min-1 at T = 30 C,\napproaching a factor of ~ 2 with only a change in temperature of DELTA T = 15\nC. Thermally tuning these twist and bend associated rates to optimise sensor\napproaches and device applications is proposed.\n", "  The Symmetry Improved Two-Particle-Irreducible (SI2PI) formalism is a\npowerful tool to calculate the effective potential beyond perturbation theory,\nwhereby infinite sets of selective loop-graph topologies can be resummed in a\nsystematic and consistent manner. In this paper we study the\nRenormalization-Group (RG) properties of this formalism, by proving for the\nfirst time a number of new field-theoretic results. First, the RG runnings of\nall proper 2PI couplings are found to be UV finite, in the Hartree-Fock and\nsunset approximations of the 2PI effective action. Second, the SI2PI effective\npotential is exactly RG invariant, in contrast to what happens in the ordinary\nOne-Particle-Irreducible (1PI) perturbation theory, where the effective\npotential is RG invariant only up to higher orders. Finally, we show how the\neffective potential of an O(2) theory evaluated in the SI2PI framework,\nappropriately RG improved, can reach a higher level of accuracy, even up to one\norder of magnitude, with respect to the corresponding one obtained in the 1PI\nformalism.\n", "  We study quasar proximity zones in the redshift range $5.77 \\leq z \\leq 6.54$\nby homogeneously analyzing $34$ medium resolution spectra, encompassing both\narchival and newly obtained data, and exploiting recently updated systemic\nredshift and magnitude measurements. Whereas previous studies found strong\nevolution of proximity zone sizes with redshift, and argued that this provides\nevidence for a rapidly evolving intergalactic medium (IGM) neutral fraction\nduring reionization, we measure a much shallower trend $\\propto(1+z)^{-1.44}$.\nWe compare our measured proximity zone sizes to predictions from hydrodynamical\nsimulations post-processed with one-dimensional radiative transfer, and find\ngood agreement between observations and theory irrespective of the ionization\nstate of the ambient IGM. This insensitivity to IGM ionization state has been\npreviously noted, and results from the fact that the definition of proximity\nzone size as the first drop of the smoothed quasar spectrum below the $10\\%$\nflux transmission level probes locations where the ionizing radiation from the\nquasar is an order of magnitude larger than the expected ultraviolet ionizing\nbackground that sets the neutral fraction of the IGM. Our analysis also\nuncovered three objects with exceptionally small proximity zones (two have $R_p\n< 1$proper Mpc), which constitute outliers from the observed distribution and\nare challenging to explain with our radiative transfer simulations. We consider\nvarious explanations for their origin, such as strong absorption line systems\nassociated with the quasar or patchy reionization, but find that the most\ncompelling scenario is that these quasars have been shining for $\\lesssim\n10^5$yr.\n", "  Interference enhanced wide-field nanoparticle imaging is a highly sensitive\ntechnique that has found numerous applications in labeled and label-free\nsub-diffraction-limited pathogen detection. It also provides unique\nopportunities for nanoparticle classification upon detection. More specif-\nically, the nanoparticle defocus images result in a particle-specific response\nthat can be of great utility for nanoparticle classification, particularly\nbased on type and size. In this work, we com- bine a model based supervised\nlearning algorithm with a wide-field common-path interferometric microscopy\nmethod to achieve accurate nanoparticle classification. We verify our\nclassification schemes experimentally by using gold and polystyrene\nnanospheres.\n", "  A generalized approach to Wang-Landau simulations, macroscopically\nconstrained Wang-Landau, is proposed to simulate the density of states of a\nsystem with multiple macroscopic order parameters. The method breaks a\nmultidimensional random-walk process in phase space into many separate,\none-dimensional random-walk processes in well-defined subspaces. Each of these\nrandom walks is constrained to a different set of values of the macroscopic\norder parameters. When the multi-variable density of states is obtained for one\nset of values of field-like model parameters, the density of states for any\nother values of these parameters can be obtained by a simple transformation of\nthe total system energy. All thermodynamic quantities of the system can then be\nrapidly calculated at any point in the phase diagram. We demonstrate how to use\nthe multi-variable density of states to draw the phase diagram, as well as\norder-parameter probability distributions at specific phase points, for a model\nspin-crossover material: an antiferromagnetic Ising model with ferromagnetic\nlong-range interactions. The field-like parameters in this model are an\neffective magnetic field and the strength of the long-range interaction.\n", "  We investigate the formation of hot and massive circumplanetary disks (CPDs)\nand the orbital evolution of satellites formed in these disks. Because of the\ncomparatively small size-scale of the sub-disk, quick magnetic diffusion\nprevents the magnetorotational instability (MRI) from being well-developed at\nionization levels that would allow MRI in the parent protoplanetary disk. In\nthe absence of significant angular momentum transport, continuous mass supply\nfrom the parental protoplanetary disk leads to the formation of a massive CPD.\nWe have developed an evolutionary model for this scenario and have estimated\nthe orbital evolution of satellites within the disk. We find, in a certain\ntemperature range, that inward migration of a satellite can be stopped by a\nchange in the structure due to the opacity transitions. Moreover, by capturing\nsecond and third migrating satellites in mean motion resonances, a compact\nsystem in Laplace resonance can be formed in our disk models.\n", "  Recently, a test for a sign-changing gap function in a candidate multiband\nunconventional superconductor involving quasiparticle interference data was\nproposed. The test was based on the antisymmetric, Fourier transformed\nconductance maps integrated over a range of momenta $\\bf q$ corresponding to\ninterband processes, which was argued to display a particular resonant form,\nprovided the gaps changed sign between the Fermi surface sheets connected by\n$\\bf q$. The calculation was performed for a single impurity, however, raising\nthe question of how robust this measure is as a test of sign-changing pairing\nin a realistic system with many impurities. Here we reproduce the results of\nthe previous work within a model with two distinct Fermi surface sheets, and\nshow explicitly that the previous result, while exact for a single nonmagnetic\nscatterer and also in the limit of a dense set of random impurities, can be\ndifficult to implement for a few dilute impurities. In this case, however,\nappropriate isolation of a single impurity is sufficient to recover the\nexpected result, allowing a robust statement about the gap signs to be made.\n", "  In a large class of scalar-tensor theories that are potential candidates for\ndark energy, a nonminimal coupling between the scalar and the photon is\npossible. The presence of such an interaction grants us the exciting prospect\nof directly observing dark sector phenomenology in the electromagnetic\nspectrum. This paper investigates the behavior of one-electron atoms in this\nclass of modified gravity models, exploring their viability as probes of\ndeviations from general relativity in both laboratory and astrophysical\nsettings. Building heavily on earlier studies, our main contribution is\nthreefold: A thorough analysis finds additional fine-structure corrections\npreviously unaccounted for, which now predict a contribution to the Lamb shift\nthat is larger by nearly 4 orders of magnitude. In addition, they also predict\na scalar-mediated photon-photon interaction, which now constrains the scalar's\ncoupling to the photon independently of the matter coupling. This was not\npreviously possible with atomic precision tests. Our updated constraints are\n$\\log_{10}\\beta_m \\lesssim 13.4$ and $\\log_{10}\\beta_\\gamma \\lesssim 19.0$ for\nthe matter and photon coupling, respectively, although these remain\nuncompetitive with bounds from other experiments. Second, we include the\neffects of the nuclear magnetic moment, allowing for the study of hyperfine\nstructure and the 21 cm line, which hitherto have been unexplored in this\ncontext. Finally, we also examine how a background scalar leads to equivalence\nprinciple violations.\n", "  Quantum systems of interest are typically coupled to several quantum channels\n(more generally environments). In this paper, we develop an exact stochastic\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation for an open quantum system coupled to a hybrid\nenvironment containing both bosonic and fermionic particles. Such a stochastic\ndifferential equation may be obtained directly from a microscopic model through\nemploying a classical complex Gaussian noise and a non-commutative fermionic\nnoise to simulate the hybrid bath. As an immediate application of our developed\nstochastic approach, we show that the evolution of the reduced density matrix\ncan be derived by taking the average over both the bosonic noise and the\nfermionic noise. Three specific examples are given in this paper to illustrate\nthat the hybrid quantum trajectory is fully consistent with the standard\nquantum mechanics. Our examples also shed new light on the special features\nexhibited by the fermionic bath and bosnoic bath.\n", "  We study the fragmentation of eight massive clumps using data from ATLASGAL\n870 $\\mu$m, SCUBA 850 and 450 $\\mu$m, PdBI 1.3 and 3.5 mm, and probe the\nfragmentation from 1 pc to 0.01 pc scale. We find that the masses and the sizes\nof our objects follow $M \\sim r^{1.68\\pm0.05}$. The results are in agreements\nwith the predictions of Li (2017) where $M \\sim r^{5/3}$. Inside each object,\nthe densest structures seem to be centrally condensed, with $\\rho(r)\\sim\nr^{-2}$. Our observational results support a scenario where molecular gas in\nthe Milky Way is supported by a turbulence characterized by a constant energy\ndissipation rate, and gas fragments like clumps and cores are structures which\nare massive enough to be dynamically detached from the ambient medium.\n", "  Individual, luminescent point defects in solids so called color centers are\natomic-sized quantum systems enabling sensing and imaging with nanoscale\nspatial resolution. In this overview, we introduce nanoscale sensing based on\nindividual nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We discuss two central\nchallenges of the field: First, the creation of highly-coherent, shallow NV\ncenters less than 10 nm below the surface of single-crystal diamond. Second,\nthe fabrication of tip-like photonic nanostructures that enable efficient\nfluorescence collection and can be used for scanning probe imaging based on\ncolor centers with nanoscale resolution.\n", "  We show that Zamolodchikov dynamics of a recurrent quiver has zero algebraic\nentropy only if the quiver has a weakly subadditive labeling, and conjecture\nthe converse. By assigning a pair of generalized Cartan matrices of affine type\nto each quiver with an additive labeling, we completely classify such quivers,\nobtaining $40$ infinite families and $13$ exceptional quivers. This completes\nthe program of classifying Zamolodchikov periodic and integrable quivers.\n", "  I summarize the highlights of the theory talks at the 52nd Rencontres de\nMoriond: QCD and high energy interactions.\n", "  Motivated by quantum mechanical considerations we earlier suggested an\nalternative action for discretised quantum gravity which has a dimension of\nlength. It is the so called \"linear\" action. The proposed action is a \"square\nroot\" of the classical area action in gravity and has in front of the action a\nnew constant of dimension one. Here we shall consider the continuous limit of\nthe discretised linear action. We shall demonstrate that in the modified theory\nof gravity there appear space-time regions of the Schwarzschild radius scale\nwhich are unreachable by test particles. These regions are located in the\nplaces where standard theory of gravity has singularities. We are confronted\nhere with a drastically new concept that there may exist space-time regions\nwhich are excluded from the physical scene, being physically unreachable by\ntest particles or observables. If this concept is accepted, then it seems\nplausible that the gravitational singularities are excluded from the modified\ntheory.\n", "  Trapped surface formation in general relativity can be studied through a\ncoupled set of nonlinear equations, where various terms can be neglected, as\nwas proved by a rigorous mathematical analysis of Christodoulou. This paper is\ndevoted to a pedagogical synthesis of the mathematical formalism employed in\nthis analysis, i.e. the optical structure of general relativity investigated by\nChristodoulou, Klainerman and other authors after them.\n", "  In the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram, the binary metallic compound\nMnSi exhibits three magnetic phases below Tc ~ 29 K. An unconventional\nhelicoidal phase is observed in zero field. At moderate field intensity a\nconical phase sets in. Near Tc, in an intermediate field range, a skyrmion\nlattice phase appears. Here we show the magnetic structure in the conical phase\nto strongly depend on the field direction and to deviate substantially from a\nconventional conical structure.\n", "  A Gedanken experiment is described to explore a counter-intuitive property of\nquantum mechanics. A particle is placed in a one-dimensional infinite well. The\nbarrier on one side of the well is suddenly removed and the chamber\ndramatically enlarged. At specific, periodically recurring, times the particle\ncan be found with probability one at the opposite end of the enlarged chamber\nin an interval of the same size as the initial well. With the help of symmetry\nconsiderations these times are calculated and shown to be dependent on the mass\nof the particle and the size of the enlarged chamber. Parameter ranges are\ngiven, where the non-relativistic nature of standard quantum mechanics becomes\nparticularly apparent.\n", "  From a simplified version of the mathematical structure of the strong\ncoupling limit of the exact exchange-correlation functional, we construct an\napproximation for the electronic repulsion energy at physical coupling\nstrength, which is fully non-local. This functional is self-interaction free\nand yields energy densities within the definition of the electrostatic\npotential of the exchange-correlation hole that are locally accurate and have\nthe correct asymptotic behavior. The model is able to capture strong\ncorrelation effects that arise from chemical bond dissociation, without relying\non error cancellation. These features, which are usually missed by standard DFT\nfunctionals, are captured by the highly nonlocal structure, which goes beyond\nthe Jacob's ladder framework for functional construction, by using integrals of\nthe density as the key ingredient. Possible routes for obtaining the full\nexchange-correlation functional by recovering the missing kinetic component of\nthe correlation energy are also implemented and discussed.\n", "  As far as the renormalization in perturbative QCD is concerned the n-point\none particle irreducible (1PI) proper vertex function is the basic building\nblock where the ultra-violet (UV) divergence occurs when the loop momentum\nintegration limit goes to infinity. In this paper we express the S-matrix\nelement for the $gg \\rightarrow ggg$ scattering process at all orders in\ncoupling constant in terms of 5-point, 4-point, 3-point 1PI proper vertex\nfunctions and the (full) propagator by using the path integral formulation of\nQCD.\n", "  A detailed understanding of the relation between microscopic structure and\nphonon propagation at the nan oscale is essential to design materials with\ndesired phononic and thermal properties.Here we uncover a new mechanism of\nphonon interaction in surface oxidized membranes, i.e., native oxide layers\ninteract with phonons in ultra-thin silicon membranes through local resonances.\nThe local resonances reduce the low frequency phonon group velocities and\nshorten their mean free path. This effect opens up a new strategy for ultralow\nthermal conductivity design as it complements the scattering mechanism which\nscatters higher frequency modes effectively. The combination of native oxide\nlayer and alloying with germanium in concentration as small as 5% reduces the\nthermal conductivity of silicon membranes to 100 time lower than the bulk. In\naddition, the resonance mechanism produced by native oxide surface layers is\nparticularly effective for thermal condutivity reduction even at very low\ntemperatures, at which only low frequency modes are populated.\n", "  The condition and specific features of non-dipole regime of radiation is\ndiscussed in connection with the results of recent CERN experiment NA63 on\nmeasurement of radiation power spectrum of $149\\,$GeV electrons in thin\ntantalum targets. The first experimental detection of logarithmic dependence of\nradiation yield from the target thickness is the conclusive evidence of the\neffect of radiation suppression in a thin layer of matter, which was predicted\nmany years ago, and which is the direct manifestation of radiation of\nrelativistic electron with non-equilibrium own Coulomb field. The special\nfeatures of angular distribution of radiation and its polarization in a thin\ntarget at non-dipole regime are proposed for a new experimental study.\n", "  Microscopic artificial swimmers have recently become highly attractive due to\ntheir promising potential for biomedical applications. The pioneering work of\nDreyfus et al (2005) has demonstrated the motion of a microswimmer with an\nundulating chain of superparamagnetic beads, which is actuated by an\noscillating external magnetic field. Interestingly, it has also been\ntheoretically predicted that the swimming direction of this swimmer will\nundergo a $90^\\circ$-transition when the magnetic field's oscillations\namplitude is increased above a critical value of $\\sqrt{2}$. In this work, we\nfurther investigate this transition both theoretically and experimentally by\nusing numerical simulations and presenting a novel flexible microswimmer with a\nsuperparamagnetic head. We realize the $90^\\circ$-transition in swimming\ndirection, prove that this effect depends on both frequency and amplitude of\nthe oscillating magnetic field, and demonstrate the existence of an optimal\namplitude, under which, maximal swimming speed can be achieved. By\nasymptotically analyzing the dynamic motion of microswimmer with a minimal\ntwo-link model, we reveal that the stability transitions representing the\nchanges in the swimming direction are induced by the effect of nonlinear\nparametric excitation.\n", "  A simple locus model for the space-time fabric is presented and is compared\nwith quantum foam and random walk models. The induced indeterminacies in\nmomentum are calculated and it is shown that these space-time fabric\nindeterminacies are, in most cases, negligible compared with the quantum\nmechanical indeterminacies. This result restricts the possibilities of an\nexperimental observation of the space-time fabric.\n", "  We introduce a sigma model lagrangian generalising a number of new and old\nmodels which can be thought of as chiral, including the Schild string,\nambitwistor strings, and the recently introduced tensionless AdS twistor\nstrings. This \"chiral sigma model\" describes maps from a $p$-brane worldvolume\ninto a symplectic space and is manifestly diffeomorphism- and Weyl-invariant\ndespite the absence of a worldvolume metric. Construction of the\nBatalin-Vilkovisky master action leads to a BRST operator under which the\ngauge-fixed action is BRST-exact; we discuss whether this implies that the\nchiral brane sigma model defines a topological field theory.\n", "  We address the controversy over the proximity effect between topological\nmaterials and high T$_{c}$ superconductors. Junctions are produced between\nBi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\\delta}$ and materials with different Fermi\nsurfaces (Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ \\& graphite). Both cases reveal tunneling spectra\nconsistent with Andreev reflection. This is confirmed by magnetic field that\nshifts features via the Doppler effect. This is modeled with a single parameter\nthat accounts for tunneling into a screening supercurrent. Thus the tunneling\ninvolves Cooper pairs crossing the heterostructure, showing the Fermi surface\nmis-match does not hinder the ability to form transparent interfaces, which is\naccounted for by the extended Brillouin zone and different lattice symmetries.\n", "  Quantum phase slips (QPS) may produce non-equilibrium voltage fluctuations in\ncurrent-biased superconducting nanowires. Making use of the Keldysh technique\nand employing the phase-charge duality arguments we investigate such\nfluctuations within the four-point measurement scheme and demonstrate that shot\nnoise of the voltage detected in such nanowires may essentially depend on the\nparticular measurement setup. In long wires the shot noise power decreases with\nincreasing frequency $\\Omega$ and vanishes beyond a threshold value of $\\Omega$\nat $T \\to 0$\n", "  Since Stephen Hawking's original 1975 paper on black hole evaporation, there\nhas been a consensus that the problem of \"loss of information\" is both deep and\ntroubling. It is also thought that resolution of the problem may hold some\nconceptual keys to the unification of gravity with the other forces. I argue\nthat this consensus view is mistaken. The so-called \"information loss paradox\"\narises rather from the inaccurate application of foundational principles,\ninvolving both mathematical and conceptual errors. The resources for resolving\nthe \"paradox\" are familiar and uncontroversial, as has been pointed out in the\nliterature. The problem ought to have been dismissed 40 years ago. Recent\nradical attempts to solve the problem are blind alleys, solutions in search of\na problem.\n", "  Integrating different semiconductor materials into an epitaxial device\nstructure offers additional degrees of freedom to select for optimal material\nproperties in each layer. However, interface between materials with different\nvalences (i.e. III-V, II-VI and IV semiconductors) can be difficult to form\nwith high quality. Using ZnSe/GaAs as a model system, we explore the use of UV\nillumination during heterovalent interface growth by molecular beam epitaxy as\na way to modify the interface properties. We find that UV illumination alters\nthe mixture of chemical bonds at the interface, permitting the formation of\nGa-Se bonds that help to passivate the underlying GaAs layer. Illumination also\nhelps to reduce defects in the ZnSe epilayer. These results suggest that\nmoderate UV illumination during growth may be used as a way to improve the\noptical properties of both the GaAs and ZnSe layers on either side of the\ninterface.\n", "  As modern precision cosmological measurements continue to show agreement with\nthe broad features of the standard $\\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM)\ncosmological model, we are increasingly motivated to look for small departures\nfrom the standard model's predictions which might not be detected with standard\napproaches. While searches for extensions and modifications of $\\Lambda$CDM\nhave to date turned up no convincing evidence of beyond-the-standard-model\ncosmology, the list of models compared against $\\Lambda$CDM is by no means\ncomplete and is often governed by readily-coded modifications to standard\nBoltzmann codes. Also, standard goodness-of-fit methods such as a naive\n$\\chi^2$ test fail to put strong pressure on the null $\\Lambda$CDM hypothesis,\nsince modern datasets have orders of magnitudes more degrees of freedom than\n$\\Lambda$CDM. Here we present a method of tuning goodness-of-fit tests to\ndetect potential sub-dominant extra-$\\Lambda$CDM signals present in the data\nthrough compressing observations in a way that maximizes extra-$\\Lambda$CDM\nsignal variation over noise and $\\Lambda$CDM variation. This method, based on a\nKarhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve transformation of the data, is tuned to be maximally\nsensitive to particular types of variations characteristic of the tuning model;\nbut, unlike direct model comparison, the test is also sensitive to features\nthat only partially mimic the tuning model. As an example of its use, we apply\nthis method in the context of a nonstandard primordial power spectrum compared\nagainst the $2015$ $Planck$ CMB temperature and polarization power spectrum. We\nfind weak evidence of extra-$\\Lambda$CDM physics, conceivably due to known\nsystematics in the 2015 Planck polarization release.\n", "  An extended social force model with a dynamic navigation field is proposed to\nstudy bidirectional pedestrian movement. The dynamic navigation field is\nintroduced to describe the desired direction of pedestrian motion resulting\nfrom the decision-making processes of pedestrians. The macroscopic fundamental\ndiagrams obtained using the extended model are validated against camera-based\nobservations. Numerical results show that this extended model can reproduce\ncollective phenomena in pedestrian traffic, such as dynamic multilane flow and\nstable separate-lane flow. Pedestrians' path choice behavior significantly\naffects the probability of congestion and the number of self-organized lanes.\n", "  This is an elementary introduction to infinite-dimensional probability. In\nthe lectures, we compute the exact mean values of some functionals on C[0,1]\nand L[0,1] by considering these functionals as infinite-dimensional random\nvariables. The results show that there exist the complete concentration of\nmeasure phenomenon for these mean values since the variances are all zeroes.\n", "  Community detection provides invaluable help for various applications, such\nas marketing and product recommendation. Traditional community detection\nmethods designed for plain networks may not be able to detect communities with\nhomogeneous attributes inside on attributed networks with attribute\ninformation. Most of recent attribute community detection methods may fail to\ncapture the requirements of a specific application and not be able to mine the\nset of required communities for a specific application. In this paper, we aim\nto detect the set of target communities in the target subspace which has some\nfocus attributes with large importance weights satisfying the requirements of a\nspecific application. In order to improve the university of the problem, we\naddress the problem in an extreme case where only two sample nodes in any\npotential target community are provided. A Target Subspace and Communities\nMining (TSCM) method is proposed. In TSCM, a sample information extension\nmethod is designed to extend the two sample nodes to a set of exemplar nodes\nfrom which the target subspace is inferred. Then the set of target communities\nare located and mined based on the target subspace. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method and\napplications on real-world datasets show its application values.\n", "  Social networks are typical attributed networks with node attributes.\nDifferent from traditional attribute community detection problem aiming at\nobtaining the whole set of communities in the network, we study an\napplication-oriented problem of mining an application-aware community\norganization with respect to specific concerned attributes. The concerned\nattributes are designated based on the requirements of any application by a\nuser in advance. The application-aware community organization w.r.t. concerned\nattributes consists of the communities with feature subspaces containing these\nconcerned attributes. Besides concerned attributes, feature subspace of each\nrequired community may contain some other relevant attributes. All relevant\nattributes of a feature subspace jointly describe and determine the community\nembedded in such subspace. Thus the problem includes two subproblems, i.e., how\nto expand the set of concerned attributes to complete feature subspaces and how\nto mine the communities embedded in the expanded subspaces. Two subproblems are\njointly solved by optimizing a quality function called subspace fitness. An\nalgorithm called ACM is proposed. In order to locate the communities\npotentially belonging to the application-aware community organization, cohesive\nparts of a network backbone composed of nodes with similar concerned attributes\nare detected and set as the community seeds. The set of concerned attributes is\nset as the initial subspace for all community seeds. Then each community seed\nand its attribute subspace are adjusted iteratively to optimize the subspace\nfitness. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our method and applications on real-world\nnetworks show its application values.\n", "  Graphene photonics has emerged as a promising platform for providing\ndesirable optical functionality. However, graphene's monolayer-scale thickness\nfundamentally restricts the available light matter interaction, posing a\ncritical design challenge for integrated devices, particularly in wavelength\nregimes where graphene plasmonics is untenable. While several plasmonic designs\nhave been proposed to enhance graphene light interaction in these regimes, they\nsuffer from substantial insertion loss due to metal absorption. Here we report\na non-resonant metamaterial-based waveguide platform to overcome the design\nbottleneck associated with graphene device. Such metamaterial structure enables\nlow insertion loss even though metal is being utilized. By examining waveguide\ndispersion characteristics via closed-form analysis, it is demonstrated that\nthe metamaterial approach can provide optimized optical field that overlaps\nwith the graphene monolayer. This enables graphene-based integrated components\nwith superior optical performance. Specifically, the metamaterial-assisted\ngraphene modulator can provide 5-fold improvement in extinction ratio compared\nto Si nanowire, while reducing insertion loss by one order magnitude compared\nto plasmonic structures. Such a waveguide configuration thus allows one to\nmaximize the optical potential that graphene holds in the telecom and visible\nregimes.\n", "  If the heaviest neutrino mass eigenstate is unstable, its decay modes could\ninclude lighter neutrino eigenstates. In this case part of the decay products\ncould be visible, as they would interact at neutrino detectors via mixing. At\nneutrino oscillation experiments, a characteristic signature of such\n\\emph{visible neutrino decay} would be an apparent excess of events at low\nenergies. We focus on a simple phenomenological model in which the heaviest\nneutrino decays as $\\nu_3 \\rightarrow \\nu_{1,2} + \\phi$, where $\\phi$ is a new\nlight scalar. If neutrinos are Majorana particles the helicity-flipping decays\nwould be observable (i.e., $\\nu \\to \\bar\\nu + \\phi$), leading to interesting\nobservable consequences on the event rates. We compute the sensitivities of the\nDeep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to the couplings of the new scalar\nas a function of the lightest neutrino mass. Under the assumption that only the\nheaviest neutrino is unstable, and for a normal mass ordering, we find that\nDUNE will be sensitive to values of $\\tau_3/m_3 > 1.95 - 2.6\\times\n10^{-10}$~s/eV (90\\% C.L.) (depending on the lightest neutrino mass), where\n$\\tau_3$ and $m_3$ are the lifetime and mass of $\\nu_3$, respectively.\n", "  Quantifying the variation in emission properties of fluorescent nanodiamonds\nis important for developing their wide-ranging applicability. Directed\nself-assembly techniques show promise for positioning nanodiamonds precisely\nenabling such quantification. Here we show an approach for depositing\nnanodiamonds in pre-determined arrays which are used to gather statistical\ninformation about fluorescent lifetimes. The arrays were created via a layer of\nphotoresist patterned with grids of apertures using electron beam lithography\nand then drop-cast with nanodiamonds. Electron microscopy revealed a 90%\naverage deposition yield across 3,376 populated array sites, with an average of\n20 nanodiamonds per site. Confocal microscopy, optimised for nitrogen vacancy\nfluorescence collection, revealed a broad distribution of fluorescent lifetimes\nin agreement with literature. This method for statistically quantifying\nfluorescent nanoparticles provides a step towards fabrication of hybrid\nphotonic devices for applications from quantum cryptography to sensing.\n", "  We present an experimental scheme of implementing multiple spins in a\nclassical XY model using a non-degenerate optical parametric oscillator (NOPO)\nnetwork. We built an NOPO network to simulate a one-dimensional XY Hamiltonian\nwith 5000 spins and externally controllable effective temperatures. The XY spin\nvariables in our scheme are mapped onto the phases of multiple NOPO pulses in a\nsingle ring cavity and interactions between XY spins are implemented by mutual\ninjections between NOPOs. We show the steady-state distribution of optical\nphases of such NOPO pulses is equivalent to the Boltzmann distribution of the\ncorresponding XY model. Estimated effective temperatures converged to the\nsetting values, and the estimated temperatures and the mean energy exhibited\ngood agreement with the numerical simulations of the Langevin dynamics of NOPO\nphases.\n", "  We propose a unified diffusion-mobility relation which quantifies both\nquantum and classical levels of understanding on electron dynamics in ordered\nand disordered materials. This attempt overcomes the inability of classical\nEinstein relation (diffusion-mobility ratio) to explain the quantum behaviors,\nconceptually well-settles the dimensional effect, phase transition and\nnonlinear behavior of electronic transport. Our proposed theory relies on the\nchemical potential which provides the coupling mechanism of charge-heat\ncurrent, due to electron-phonon coupling. We have derived expressions which\nexplain charge transport in both degenerate and nondegenerate materials, and\nalso provide the linear and nonlinear relationship between the charge density\nand chemical potential. Theoretically, we find that the symmetrical nature of\nelectron-hole transport in strongly correlated two-dimensional semiconductors\nindicates linear dispersion. We also observe the broken symmetry in the\nnonlinear regime. This generalized diffusion-mobility relation explains both\nthe strongly and weakly correlated systems from low temperature to high\ntemperature, in both the relativistic as well as nonrelativistic domains. In\nvanishing charge density limit of nondegenerate cases, the nonlinear transport\nreduces to linear like transport, which is the classical Einstein relation.\n", "  This paper introduces a biparametric family of Lyapunov functions for a\nnon-linear mathematical model based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations able to\nreproduce some main features of the X-ray bursting behaviour exhibited by the\nmicroquasar GRS 1915+105. These functions are useful to investigate the\nproperties of equilibrium points and allow us to demonstrate a theorem on the\nglobal stability. The transition between bursting and stable behaviour is also\nanalyzed.\n", "  Quantum optomechanics opens a possibility to mediate a physical connection of\nquantum optics and classical thermodynamics. We propose and theoretically\nanalyze a one-way chain starting from various quantum states of radiation. In\nthe chain, the radiation state is first ideally swapped to sufficiently large\nmechanical oscillator (membrane). Then the membrane mechanically pushes a\nclassical almost mass-less piston, which is pressing a gas in a small\ncontainer. As a result we observe strongly nonlinear and nonmonotonic transfer\nof the energy stored in classical and quantum uncertainty of radiation to\nmechanical work. The amount of work and even its sign depends strongly on the\nuncertainty of the radiation state. Our theoretical prediction would stimulate\nan experimental proposals for such optomechanical connection to thermodynamics.\n", "  We propose a generation of a low-noise state of optomechanical oscillator by\na temperature dependent force. We analyze the situation in which a quantum\noptomechanical oscillator (denoted as the membrane) is driven by an external\nforce (produced by the piston). Both systems are embedded in a common heat bath\nat certain temperature $T$. The driving force the piston exerts on the membrane\nis bath temperature dependent. Initially, for $T=T_0$, the piston is linearly\ncoupled to the membrane. The bath temperature is then reversibly changed to\n$T\\neq T_0$. The change of temperature shifts the membrane, but simultaneously\nalso increases its fluctuations. The resulting equilibrium state of the\nmembrane is analyzed from the point of view of mechanical, as well as of\nthermodynamic characteristics. We compare these characteristics of membrane and\nderive their intimate connection. Next, we cool down the thermal noise of the\nmembrane, bringing it out of equilibrium, still being in the contact with heat\nbath. This cooling retains the effective canonical Gibbs state with the\neffective temperature $T^\\star$. In such case we study the analogs of the\nequilibrium quantities for low-noise mechanical states of the membrane.\n", "  Two new high-precision measurements of the deuterium abundance from absorbers\nalong the line of sight to the quasar PKS1937--1009 were presented. The\nabsorbers have lower neutral hydrogen column densities (N(HI) $\\approx$\n18\\,cm$^{-2}$) than for previous high-precision measurements, boding well for\nfurther extensions of the sample due to the plenitude of low column density\nabsorbers. The total high-precision sample now consists of 12 measurements with\na weighted average deuterium abundance of D/H = $2.55\\pm0.02\\times10^{-5}$. The\nsample does not favour a dipole similar to the one detected for the fine\nstructure constant. The increased precision also calls for improved\nnucleosynthesis predictions. For that purpose we have updated the public\nAlterBBN code including new reactions, updated nuclear reaction rates, and the\npossibility of adding new physics such as dark matter. The standard Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis prediction of D/H = $2.456\\pm0.057\\times10^{-5}$ is consistent\nwith the observed value within 1.7 standard deviations.\n", "  We derive formulas for the number of polycubes of size $n$ and perimeter $t$\nthat are proper in $n-1$ and $n-2$ dimensions. These formulas complement\ncomputer based enumerations of perimeter polynomials in percolation problems.\nWe demonstrate this by computing the perimeter polynomial for $n=12$ in\narbitrary dimension $d$.\n", "  Recently several papers have been published, where \"a new mechanism\" of dark\nmatter burning and freezing is suggested. The usual two-body annihilation\nprocess is generalized to multi-body initial states, mostly three-body. These\nprocesses have quite a few interesting cosmological implications. I want to\nindicate here that such a process was studied in 1980 to determine the\ncosmological number density of the so called theta-particles. The file of the\ntranslated into English original paper and the reference to the published\nEnglish version are attached.\n", "  We present a method based on graph theory for evaluation of the inelastic\npropensity rules for molecules exhibiting complete destructive quantum\ninterference in their elastic transmission. The method uses an extended\nadjacency matrix corresponding to the structural graph of the molecule for\ncalculating the Green function between the sites with attached electrodes and\nconsequently states the corresponding conditions the electron-vibration\ncoupling matrix must meet for the observation of an inelastic signal between\nthe terminals. The method can be fully automated and we provide a functional\nwebsite running a code using Wolfram Mathematica, which returns a graphical\ndepiction of destructive quantum interference configurations together with the\nassociated inelastic propensity rules for a wide class of molecules.\n", "  Two models have been proposed for the interconnection of the defect Gibbs\nenergy g^i with bulk properties almost 60 and 30 years ago, respectively. The\none, proposed by Zener, assumes that g^i can be accounted for the work that\ngoes into straining the lattice and hence it is proportional to the shear\nmodulus of the solid. The other, considers that, since g^i corresponds to an\nisobaric and isothermal process, it should be proportional to the isothermal\nbulk modulus and the mean volume per atom. The results of these two models are\ncompared for different processes (defect formation, self-diffusion activation,\nhetero-diffusion) in a variety of solids including metals (fcc, bcc and\ntetragonal) as well as solids that exhibit superionic behavior. We find that\nthe latter model does better than the former.\n", "  We show that the values of the defect entropy and the defect enthalpy for the\nvacancy formation in diamond, have a ratio which is comparable to the one\npredicted by a model suggested four decades ago. This model, which\ninterconnects the formation Gibbs energy with the bulk elastic and expansivity\ndata, has been also recently found of value in high $T_c$-superconductors as\nwell as in glass-forming liquids.\n", "  Melting of rhombohedral boron subnitride B13N2 has been studied in situ at\npressures to 8 GPa using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electrical\nresistivity measurements. It has been found that above 2.6 GPa B13N2 melts\nincongruently, and the melting curve exhibits positive slope of 31(3) K/GPa\nthat points to a lower density of the melt as compared to the solid phase.\n", "  Self-supported electrocatalysts being generated and employed directly as\nelectrode for energy conversion has been intensively pursued in the fields of\nmaterials chemistry and energy. Herein, we report a synthetic strategy to\nprepare freestanding hierarchically structured, nitrogen-doped nanoporous\ngraphitic carbon membranes functionalized with Janus-type Co/CoP nanocrystals\n(termed as HNDCM-Co/CoP), which were successfully applied as a\nhighly-efficient, binder-free electrode in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).\nBenefited from multiple structural merits, such as high degree of\ngraphitization, three-dimensionally interconnected micro-/meso-/macropores,\nuniform nitrogen-doping, well-dispersed Co/CoP nanocrystals as well as the\nconfinement effect of the thin carbon layer on the nanocrystals, HNDCM-Co/CoP\nexhibited superior electrocatalytic activity and long-term operation stability\nfor HER under both acid and alkaline conditions. As a proof-of-concept of\npractical usage, a macroscopic piece of HNDCM-Co/CoP of 5.6 cm x 4 cm x 60 um\nin size was prepared in our laboratory. Driven by a solar cell,\nelectroreduction of water in alkaline condition (pH 14) was performed, and H2\nhas been produced at a rate of 16 ml/min, demonstrating its potential as\nreal-life energy conversion systems.\n", "  For highly interested organolead perovskite based solar cells, the\nphotoproducts are regarded as the co-existed exciton and free carriers. In this\nstudy, we carefully re-examined this conclusion with our recently developed\ndensity-resolved spectroscopic method. Heat-annealing related two photoproduct\nsystems are observed. We found that the widely accepted model is only true for\nsingle crystal and freshly made films without heat-annealing. For those\nsufficiently heat-annealed films, another system presenting significant\nemissive exciton-carrier collision (ECC) is discovered. In addition, the\nappearing of ECC indicates the emerging of an internal morphology after heat\nannealing, which is assigned to a recently discussed twinning subgrain\nstructure. We proved that such subgrain structures broadly exist in perovskite\nfilms. This finding could prove the morphological basis for high performance of\nperovskite working layers.\n", "  Generalizations of the (rank 1) Bannai-Ito algebra are obtained from a\nrefinement of the grade involution of the Lie super algebra\n$\\mathfrak{osp}(1,2)$. A hyperoctahedral extension is derived by using a\nrealization of $\\mathfrak{osp}(1,2)$ in terms of Dunkl operators associated to\nthe Weyl group $B_3$.\n", "  We present the SI and other unit systems, including cgs-em and cgs-es, in a\nframework whereby a system of fully independent and dimensionally orthogonal\nbase units is modified by conventions designed to simplify the equations that\nare used within each system. We propose that the radian can be seen as an\nindependent unit whose dimensional status is modified in the SI and other unit\nsystems for this purpose. This framework clarifies how different unit systems\nare interrelated, and identifies the key pieces of information that are needed\nto define both a unit system and the equations that are to be used with it.\nSpecifically, these are the size of the base units in the unsimplified system,\ntogether with sufficient equations to identify all the conventions adopted by\nthe particular unit system. The appropriate extra information for the revised\nSI is presented. We do not propose that the treatment of angles as\ndimensionless within the SI is changed. It is also proposed that the Gaussian\nunit system is best seen as identical to cgs-es, but with the B and H symbols\nin equations used to represent relativistic versions of B and H, which should\nproperly be treated as different quantities. These different versions of B and\nH can similarly be used within the SI, with many of the advantages of the\nHeaviside-Lorentz system.\n", "  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allow the exploration of the phase space\nof biopolymers through the integration of equations of motion of their\nconstituent atoms. The analysis of MD trajectories often relies on the choice\nof collective variables (CVs) along which the dynamics of the system is\nprojected. We developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for facilitating the\ninteractive choice of the appropriate CVs. The GUI allows: defining\ninteractively new CVs; partitioning the configurations into microstates\ncharacterized by similar values of the CVs; calculating the free energies of\nthe microstates for both unbiased and biased (metadynamics) simulations;\nclustering the microstates in kinetic basins; visualizing the free energy\nlandscape as a function of a subset of the CVs used for the analysis. A simple\nmouse click allows one to quickly inspect structures corresponding to specific\npoints in the landscape.\n", "  In this article, we introduce two kinds of Fluctuation Theorems (FT)\ncontaining information for autonomous Maxwell's demon-assisted machines. Using\nJensen's Inequality, we obtain Landauer's principle formulation of the second\nlaw for the whole process of the machine. Finally we make use of our results to\nanalyze a new information device. \\pacs{05.70.Ln, 05.40.-a, 89.70.Cf}\n", "  Multi-color ($B$ $V$ $R_c$ $I_c$) CCD photometric light curves of the contact\nbinary V502 Oph are analyzed using the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) program. The\nsolutions reveal that V502 Oph is a W-subtype contact ($f = 35.3\\,\\%$) binary\nsystem. The temperature difference between its two components is $240K$ and the\nmore massive star has a lower surface temperature. A cool spot is added in our\nmodel to account for the light curves' asymmetry (O'Connell effect) and third\nlight is detected for the first time in the light curves' modeling. Combining\nthe orbital inclination ($i = 76.4^{\\circ}$) with the published mass function\nof V502 Oph, the absolute physical parameters of the two components are\ndetermined, which are $M_1= 0.46(\\pm0.02)M_\\odot, M_2=1.37(\\pm0.02)M_\\odot,\nR_1=0.94(\\pm0.01)R_\\odot, R_2=1.51(\\pm0.01)R_\\odot, L_1=1.13(\\pm0.02)L_\\odot$\nand $L_2=2.49(\\pm0.03)L_\\odot$. The formation and evolutionary status of V502\nOph are discussed. All photoelectric and CCD times of light minimum about V502\nOph are gathered and its orbital period variations are analyzed. The results\nshow that the orbital period of V502 Oph is decreasing continuously at a rate\nof $dP/dt=-1.69\\times{10^{-7}}day\\cdot year^{-1}$, which corresponds to a\nconservative mass transfer rate of\n$\\frac{dM_{2}}{dt}=-3.01\\times{10^{-8}}M_\\odot/year$. The light-travel time\neffect (LTTE) is due to the presence of a close-in tertiary component with a\nperiod of $P_3=18.7$ years and an amplitute of 0.00402days. V502 Oph is an\nideal target to test the formation and evolution theories of binary and\nmultiple systems in which the light curves, $O - C$ curve and spectroscopic\nobservations are comprehensively researched.\n", "  Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures consisting of two dimensional materials\noffer a platform to obtain material by design and are very attractive owing to\nnovel electronic states. Research on 2D van der Waals heterostructures (vdWH)\nhas so far been focused on fabricating individually stacked atomically thin\nunary or binary crystals. Such systems include graphene (Gr), hexagonal boron\nnitride (h-BN) and member of the transition metal dichalcogenides family. Here\nwe present our experimental study of the opto-electronic properties of a\nnaturally occurring vdWH, known as Franckeite, which is a complex layered\ncrystal composed of lead, tin, antimony, iron and sulfur. We present here that\nthin film franckeite (60 nm < d < 100 nm) behave as narrow band gap\nsemiconductor demonstrating a wide band photoresponse. We have observed the\nband-edge transition at ~ 1500 nm (~830 meV) and high external quantum\nefficiency (EQE~3%) at room temperature. Laser power resolved and temperature\nresolved photocurrent measurements reveal that the photo-carrier generation and\nrecombination are dominated by continuously distributed trap states within the\nband gap. To understand wavelength resolved photocurrent, we also calculated\nthe optical absorption properties via density functional theory. Finally, we\nhave shown that the device has fast photoresponse with rise time as fast as ~ 1\nms. Our study provides a fundamental understanding of the optoelectronic\nbehavior in a complex naturally occurring vdWH and can open up the\npossibilities of producing new type of nanoscale optoelectronic devices with\ntailored properties.\n", "  We test the renormalization group procedure for effective particles (RGPEP)\non a model of fermion-scalar interaction based on the Yukawa theory. The model\nis obtained by truncating the Yukawa theory to just two Fock sectors in the\nDirac front form of Hamiltonian dynamics, a fermion, and a fermion and a boson,\nfor the purpose of simple analytic calculation that exhibits steps of the\nprocedure.\n", "  Recently, dinitriles (NC(CH2)nCN) and especially adiponitrile (ADN, n=4) have\nattracted the attention as secure electrolyte solvents due to their chemical\nstability, high boiling points, high flash points and low vapor pressure. The\ngood solvating properties of ADN toward lithium salts and its high\nelectrochemical stability (~ 6V vs. Li/Li+) make it suitable for safer Li-ions\ncells without performances loss. In this study, ADN is used as a single\nelectrolyte solvent with lithium bis(trimethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). This\nelectrolyte allows the use of aluminum collectors as almost no corrosion occurs\nat voltages up to 4.2 V. Physico-chemical properties of ADN-LiTFSI electrolyte\nsuch as salt dissolution, conductivity and viscosity were determined. The\ncycling performances of batteries using Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) as anode and\nLiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NMC) as cathode were determined. The results indicate that\nLTO/NMC batteries exhibit excellent rate capabilities with a columbic\nefficiency close to 100%. As an example, cells were able to reach a capacity of\n165 mAh.g-1 at 0.1C and a capacity retention of more than 98% after 200 cycles\nat 0.5C. In addition, electrodes analyses by SEM, XPS and electrochemical\nimpedance spectroscopy after cycling confirming minimal surface changes of the\nelectrodes in the studied battery system\n", "  The large time and length scales and, not least, the vast number of particles\ninvolved in industrial-scale simulations inflate the computational costs of the\nDiscrete Element Method (DEM) excessively. Coarse grain models can help to\nlower the computational demands significantly. However, for effects that\nintrinsically depend on particle size, coarse grain models fail to correctly\npredict the behaviour of the granular system. To solve this problem we have\ndeveloped a new technique based on the efficient combination of fine-scale and\ncoarse grain DEM models. The method is designed to capture the details of the\ngranular system in spatially confined sub-regions while keeping the\ncomputational benefits of the coarse grain model where a lower resolution is\nsufficient. To this end, our method establishes two-way coupling between\nresolved and coarse grain parts of the system by volumetric passing of boundary\nconditions. Even more, multiple levels of coarse-graining may be combined to\nachieve an optimal balance between accuracy and speedup. This approach enables\nus to reach large time and length scales while retaining specifics of crucial\nregions. Furthermore, the presented model can be extended to coupled CFD-DEM\nsimulations, where the resolution of the CFD mesh may be changed adaptively as\nwell.\n", "  Mathematical models of real life phenomena are highly nonlinear involving\nmultiple parameters and often exhibiting complex dynamics. Experimental data\nsets are typically small and noisy, rendering estimation of parameters from\nsuch data unreliable and difficult. This paper presents a study of the Bayesian\nposterior distribution for unknown parameters of two chaotic discrete dynamical\nsystems conditioned on observations of the system. The study shows how the\nqualitative properties of the posterior are affected by the intrinsic noise\npresent in the data, the representation of this noise in the parameter\nestimation process, and the length of the data-set. The results indicate that\nincreasing length of dataset does not significantly increase the precision of\nthe estimate, and this is true for both periodic and chaotic data. On the other\nhand, increasing precision of the measurements leads to significant increase in\nprecision of the estimated parameter in case of periodic data, but not in the\ncase of chaotic data. These results are highly useful in designing laboratory\nand field-based studies in biology in general, and ecology and conservation in\nparticular.\n", "  The intriguing and still open question concerning the composition law of\n$\\kappa$-entropy $S_{\\kappa}(f)=\\frac{1}{2\\kappa}\\sum_i\n(f_i^{1-\\kappa}-f_i^{1+\\kappa})$ with $0<\\kappa<1$ and $\\sum_i f_i =1$ is here\nreconsidered and solved. It is shown that, for a statistical system described\nby the probability distribution $f=\\{ f_{ij}\\}$, made up of two statistically\nindependent subsystems, described through the probability distributions $p=\\{\np_i\\}$ and $q=\\{ q_j\\}$, respectively, with $f_{ij}=p_iq_j$, the joint entropy\n$S_{\\kappa}(p\\,q)$ can be obtained starting from the $S_{\\kappa}(p)$ and\n$S_{\\kappa}(q)$ entropies, and additionally from the entropic functionals\n$S_{\\kappa}(p/e_{\\kappa})$ and $S_{\\kappa}(q/e_{\\kappa})$, $e_{\\kappa}$ being\nthe $\\kappa$-Napier number. The composition law of the $\\kappa$-entropy is\ngiven in closed form, and emerges as a one-parameter generalization of the\nordinary additivity law of Boltzmann-Shannon entropy recovered in the $\\kappa\n\\rightarrow 0$ limit.\n"]}
