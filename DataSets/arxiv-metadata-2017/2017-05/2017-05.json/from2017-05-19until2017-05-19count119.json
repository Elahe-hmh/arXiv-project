Historically, empirical\nfits such as the popular Band function have been employed with considerable\nsuccess in interpreting the observations. While extrapolations of the Band\nparameters can provide some physical insight into the emission mechanisms\nresponsible for GRBs, these inferences do not provide a unique way of\ndiscerning between models. By fitting physical models directly this degeneracy\ncan be broken, eliminating the need for empirical functions; our analysis here\noffers a first step in this direction. One of the oldest, and leading,\ntheoretical ideas for the production of the prompt signal is the synchrotron\nshock model (SSM). Here we explore the applicability of this model to a bright\n{\\it Fermi} GBM burst with a simple temporal structure, GRB {\\it 090820}A. Our\ninvestigation implements, for the first time, thermal and non-thermal\nsynchrotron emissivities in the RMFIT forward-folding spectral analysis\nsoftware often used in GBM burst studies. We find that these synchrotron\nemissivities, together with a blackbody shape, provide at least as good a match\nwith the data as the Band GRB spectral fitting function. This success is\nachieved in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectral fits.\n", "  We generalize Ringstr\\\"om's global future causal stability results\n(Ringstr\\\"om 2009) for certain expanding cosmological solutions of the\nEinstein-scalar field equations to solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar\nfield system. In particular, after noting that the power law inflationary\nspacetimes $(M^{n+1}, \\hat{g}, \\hat{\\phi})$ considered by Ringstr\\\"om in\nRingstr\\\"om (2009) are solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system\n(with exponential potential) as well as of the Einstein-scalar field system\n(with the same exponential potential), we consider (nonlinear) perturbations of\ninitial data sets of these spacetimes which include electromagnetic\nperturbations as well as gravitational and scalar perturbations. We show that\nif (as in Ringstr\\\"om, 2009) we focus on pairs of relatively scaled open sets\n$U_{R_0} \\subset U_{4R_0}$ on an initial slice of $(M^{n+1}, \\hat{g})$, and if\nwe choose a set of perturbed data which on $ U_{4R_0}$ is sufficiently close to\nthat of $(M^{n+1}, \\hat{g},\\hat{\\phi},\\hat{A}=0)$, then in the maximal globally\nhyperbolic spacetime development $(M^{n+1},g,\\phi,A)$ of this data via the\nEinstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations, all causal geodesics emanating from\n$U_{R_0}$ are future complete (just as in $(M^{n+1}, \\hat{g})$). We also verify\nthe controlled future asymptotic behavior of the fields in the spacetime\ndevelopments of the perturbed data sets.\n", "  Correlated basis function perturbation theory and the formalism of cluster\nexpansions have been recently employed to obtain an effective interaction from\na state-of-the-art nuclear Hamiltonian. We report the results of a study of the\nsuperfluid gap in pure neutron matter, associated with formation of Cooper\npairs in the $^1S_0$ sector. The calculations have been carried out using an\nimproved version of the CBF effective interaction, in which three-nucleon\nforces are taken into account using a realistic microscopic model. Our results\nshow that the superfluid transition occurs at densities corresponding to the\nneutron star inner crust, and that inclusion of three-nucleon interactions\nleads to a sizable reduction of the energy gap at the Fermi surface.\n", "  For a toric Calabi-Yau (CY) orbifold $\\mathcal{X}$ whose underlying toric\nvariety is semi-projective, we construct and study a non-toric Lagrangian torus\nfibration on $\\mathcal{X}$, which we call the Gross fibration. We apply the\nStrominger-Yau-Zaslow (SYZ) recipe to the Gross fibration of $\\mathcal{X}$ to\nconstruct its mirror with the instanton corrections coming from genus 0 open\norbifold Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants, which are virtual counts of holomorphic\norbi-disks in $\\mathcal{X}$ bounded by fibers of the Gross fibration.\n  We explicitly evaluate all these invariants by first proving an open/closed\nequality and then employing the toric mirror theorem for suitable toric\n(partial) compactifications of $\\mathcal{X}$. Our calculations are then applied\nto\n  (1) prove a conjecture of Gross-Siebert on a relation between genus 0 open\norbifold GW invariants and mirror maps of $\\mathcal{X}$ -- this is called the\nopen mirror theorem, which leads to an enumerative meaning of mirror maps, and\n  (2) demonstrate how open (orbifold) GW invariants for toric CY orbifolds\nchange under toric crepant resolutions -- an open analogue of Ruan's crepant\nresolution conjecture.\n", "  The analog to the Legendre addition theorem is found for half-integral\nangular momentum using frame transformations for rotor states.\n", "  Some preliminary evidence suggests the conjecture that the collective\nbehaviour of systems having long-range interactions may be described more\neffectively by the Tsallis rather than by the Boltzmann/Gibbs/Shannon entropy.\nTo this end, we examine consequences of the biggest difference between these\ntwo entropies: their composition properties. We rely on a metric formalism that\nestablishes the \"hyperbolic\" nature of Tsallis entropy and explore some of its\nconsequences for the underlying systems. We present some recent and some\nforthcoming results of our work\n", "  We construct a symplectic, globally defined, minimal-coordinate, equivariant\nintegrator on products of 2-spheres. Examples of corresponding Hamiltonian\nsystems, called spin systems, include the reduced free rigid body, the motion\nof point vortices on a sphere, and the classical Heisenberg spin chain, a\nspatial discretisation of the Landau-Lifschitz equation. The existence of such\nan integrator is remarkable, as the sphere is neither a vector space, nor a\ncotangent bundle, has no global coordinate chart, and its symplectic form is\nnot even exact. Moreover, the formulation of the integrator is very simple, and\nresembles the geodesic midpoint method, although the latter is not symplectic.\n", "  It has long been speculated that the Dirac or, more generally, the\nDirac-Pauli spinor in the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) representation should behave\nlike a classical relativistic spinor in the low-energy limit when the\nprobability of particle-antiparticle pair creation and annihilation is\nnegligible. In the weak-field limit of static and homogeneous electromagnetic\nfields, by applying the method of direct perturbation theory inductively on the\norders of $1/c$ in the power series, we rigorously prove that it is indeed the\ncase: the FW transformation of the Dirac-Pauli Hamiltonian is in full agreement\nwith the classical counterpart, which is the sum of the orbital Hamiltonian for\nthe Lorentz force equation and the spin Hamiltonian for the\nThomas-Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation.\n", "  We consider the problem of how to assign treatment in a randomized\nexperiment, in which the correlation among the outcomes is informed by a\nnetwork available pre-intervention. Working within the potential outcome causal\nframework, we develop a class of models that posit such a correlation structure\namong the outcomes. Then we leverage these models to develop restricted\nrandomization strategies for allocating treatment optimally, by minimizing the\nmean square error of the estimated average treatment effect. Analytical\ndecompositions of the mean square error, due both to the model and to the\nrandomization distribution, provide insights into aspects of the optimal\ndesigns. In particular, the analysis suggests new notions of balance based on\nspecific network quantities, in addition to classical covariate balance. The\nresulting balanced, optimal restricted randomization strategies are still\ndesign unbiased, in situations where the model used to derive them does not\nhold. We illustrate how the proposed treatment allocation strategies improve on\nallocations that ignore the network structure, with extensive simulations.\n", "  The field of particle physics is living very exciting times with a plethora\nof experiments looking for new physics in complementary ways. This has made\nincreasingly necessary to obtain precise predictions in new physics models in\norder to be ready for a discovery that might be just around the corner.\nHowever, analyzing new models and studying their phenomenology can be really\nchallenging. Computing mass matrices, interaction vertices and decay rates is\nalready a tremendous task. In addition, obtaining predictions for the dark\nmatter relic density and its detection prospects, computing flavor observables\nor estimating the LHC reach in certain collider signals constitutes quite a\ntechnical work due to the precision level that is currently required. For this\nreason, computer tools such as SARAH, MicrOmegas, MadGraph, SPheno or FlavorKit\nhave become quite popular, and many physicists use them on a daily basis. In\nthis course we will learn how to use these computer tools to explore new\nphysics models and get robust numerical predictions to probe them in current\nand future experiments.\n", "  D.J. Evans, et al., [Phys. Rev. Lett. 71, 2401 (1993)] discovered a relation,\nsubsequently known as the Fluctuation Theorem (FT), which quantifies the\nprobability of observing fluctuations violating the second law of\nthermodynamics in thermostatted dissipative non-equilibrium systems. The FT has\nbeen confirmed experimentally for small systems. We analyze fluctuations of the\ntotal entropy production related to the distribution of the magnetic energy\ndensity in the quiet Sun lower atmosphere inferred by means of\nspectro-polarimetric observations. We show that the magnetic energy density is\nintermittent, at non-equilibrium and has the Markov property. The applicability\nof the FT is proven for the first time in an astronomical environment in spite\nof the seemingly large scales involved. We also found a non-linear behavior of\nthe probability current, indicating that the dynamics of the magnetic field\ndepends on the field strength. On average, however, the observed\nnon-equilibrium behavior is governed by the second law of thermodynamics for\nopen systems. Our results provide novel constraints for testing the\nhypothesizes of the solar local dynamo, which should be consistent with the\ninferred statistics of the fluctuations.\n", "  In this communication we present together four distinct techniques for the\nstudy of electronic structure of solids : the tight-binding linear muffin-tin\norbitals (TB-LMTO), the real space and augmented space recursions and the\nmodified exchange-correlation. Using this we investigate the effect of random\nvacancies on the electronic properties of the carbon hexagonal allotrope,\ngraphene, and the non-hexagonal allotrope, planar T graphene. We have inserted\nrandom vacancies at different concentrations, to simulate disorder in pristine\ngraphene and planar T graphene sheets. The resulting disorder, both on-site\n(diagonal disorder) as well as in the hopping integrals (off-diagonal\ndisorder), introduces sharp peaks in the vicinity of the Dirac point built up\nfrom localized states for both hexagonal and non-hexagonal structures. These\npeaks become resonances with increasing vacancy concentration. We find that in\npresence of vacancies, graphene-like linear dispersion appears in planar T\ngraphene and the cross points form a loop in the first Brillouin zone similar\nto buckled T graphene that originates from $\\pi$ and $\\pi$* bands without\nregular hexagonal symmetry. We also calculate the single-particle relaxation\ntime, $\\tau(\\vec{q})$ of $\\vec{q}$ labeled quantum electronic states which\noriginates from scattering due to presence of vacancies, causing quantum level\nbroadening.\n", "  In this paper, we present a general method to study magnetization dynamics in\nchemically disordered alloys. This computationally feasible technique, which\nseamlessly combines three approaches : the density functional based linear\nmuffin-tin orbitals (LMTO) for self-consistently obtaining a sparse\nHamiltonian; the generalized recursion method to obtain the one and\ntwo-particle Green functions and augmented space approach to deal with disorder\naveraging. The same formalism applied to both spectral and response properties\nshould make the errors compatible in different studies. %The underlying\ncomputational routines are optimized and parallelized for ease of handling. We\nhave demonstrated a successful application to the binary chemically disordered\nFe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$ alloys to explain several experimental features in magnon\nspectra. Our study captures significant magnon softening due to magnon-electron\nscattering for chemically disordered Fe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$ alloys within linear spin\nwave regime. As a complementary study, we have done atomistic spin dynamics\nsimulations by solving Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with parameters\nobtained from ab initio multiple scattering theory to compare with the results\nobtained from augmented space approach.\n", "  The description of physical processes in accelerated frames opens a window to\nnumerous new phenomena. One can encounter these effects both in the subatomic\nworld and on a macroscale. In the present work we review our recent results on\nthe study of the electroweak interaction of particles with an accelerated\nbackground matter. In our analysis we choose the noninertial comoving frame,\nwhere matter is at rest. Our study is based on the solution of the Dirac\nequation, which exactly takes into account both the interaction with matter and\nthe nonintertial effects. First, we study the interaction of ultrarelativistic\nneutrinos, electrons and quarks with the rotating matter. We consider the\ninfluence of the matter rotation on the resonance in neutrino oscillations and\nthe generation of anomalous electric current of charged particles along the\nrotation axis. Then, we study the creation of neutrino-antineutrino pairs in a\nlinearly accelerated matter. The applications of the obtained results for\nelementary particle physics and astrophysics are discussed.\n", "  We combine new Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck with Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillation (BAO) data to constrain the Brans-Dicke (BD) theory, in\nwhich the gravitational constant $G$ evolves with time. Observations of type Ia\nsupernovae (SNeIa) provide another important set of cosmological data, as they\nmay be regarded as standard candles after some empirical corrections. However,\nin theories that include modified gravity like the BD theory, there is some\nrisk and complication when using the SNIa data because their luminosity may\ndepend on $G$. In this paper, we assume a power law relation between the SNIa\nluminosity and $G$, but treat the power index as a free parameter. We then test\nwhether the difference in distances measured with SNIa data and BAO data can be\nreduced in such a model. We also constrain the BD theory and cosmological\nparameters by making a global fit with the CMB, BAO and SNIa data set. For the\nCMB+BAO+SNIa data set, we find $0.08\\times10^{-2} < \\zeta <0.33\\times10^{-2} $\nat the 68\\% confidence level (CL) and $-0.01\\times10^{-2} <\\zeta <0.43\\times\n10^{-2} $ at the 95\\% CL, where $\\zeta$ is related to the {BD} parameter\n$\\omega$ by $\\zeta=\\ln(1+1/\\omega)$.\n", "  Morphological instability of a planar surface ([111], [011], or [001]) of an\nultra-thin metal film is studied in a parameter space formed by three major\neffects (the quantum size effect, the surface energy anisotropy and the surface\nstress) that influence a film dewetting. The analysis is based on the extended\nMullins equation, where the effects are cast as functions of the film\nthickness. The formulation of the quantum size effect (Z. Zhang et al., PRL 80,\n5381 (1998)) includes the oscillation of the surface energy with thickness\ncaused by electrons confinement. By systematically comparing the effects, their\ncontributions into the overall stability (or instability) is highlighted.\n", "  We present a general theory of spontaneous emission at exceptional points\n(EPs)---exotic degeneracies in non-Hermitian systems. Our theory extends beyond\nspontaneous emission to any light--matter interaction described by the local\ndensity of states (e.g., absorption, thermal emission, and nonlinear frequency\nconversion). Whereas traditional spontaneous-emission theories imply infinite\nenhancement factors at EPs, we derive finite bounds on the enhancement, proving\nmaximum enhancement of 4 in passive systems with second-order EPs and\nsignificantly larger enhancements (exceeding $400\\times$) in gain-aided and\nhigher-order EP systems. In contrast to non-degenerate resonances, EPs are\nassociated with non-Lorentzian emission curves, leading to enhancements that\nscale polynomially with the resonance quality factor.\n", "  We consider the special type of pseudo-bosonic systems that can be mapped to\nstandard bosons by means of generalized Bogoliubov transformation and\ndemonstrate that a pseudo-Hermitian systems can be obtained from them by means\nof a second subsequent Bogoliubov transformation. We employ these operators in\na simple model and study three different types of scenarios for the constraints\non the model parameters giving rise to a Hermitian system, a pseudo-Hermitian\nsystem in which the second the Bogoliubov transformations is equivalent to the\nassociated Dyson map and one in which we obtain D-quasi bases.\n", "  Studies of cooperation in microbes often focus on one fitness component, with\nlittle information about or attention to the ecological context, and this can\nlead to paradoxical results. The life cycle of the social amoeba Dictyostelium\ndiscoideum includes a multicellular stage in which not necessarily clonal\namoebae aggregate upon starvation to form a possibly chimeric (genetically\nheterogeneous) fruiting body made of dead stalk and spores. The lab-measured\nreproductive skew in the spores of chimeras indicates strong social antagonism;\nthis should result in low genotypic diversity, which is inconsistent with\nobservations from nature. Two studies have suggested that this inconsistency\nstems from the one-dimensional assessment of fitness (spore production) and\nthat the solution lies in tradeoffs between multiple traits, e.g.: spore size\nversus viability; and staying vegetative versus becoming dormant. We\ntheoretically explore different tradeoff-implementing mechanisms and provide a\nunifying ecological framework in which the two tradeoffs above, as well as\nnovel ones, arise collectively in response to characteristics of the\nenvironment. We find that spore production comes at the expense of vegetative\ncell production, time to development, and, depending on the experimental setup,\nspore size and viability. Furthermore, we find that all existing experimental\nresults regarding chimeric mixes can be qualitatively recapitulated without\nneeding to invoke social interactions, which allows for simple resolutions to\npreviously paradoxical results. We conclude that the complexities of life\nhistories, including social behavior and multicellularity, can only be\nunderstood in the appropriate multidimensional ecological context.\n", "  Many natural processes rely on optimizing the success ratio of a search\nprocess. We use an experimental setup consisting of a simple online game in\nwhich players have to find a target hidden on a board, to investigate the how\nthe rounds are influenced by the detection of cues. We focus on the search\nduration and the statistics of the trajectories traced on the board. The\nexperimental data are explained by a family of random-walk-based models and\nprobabilistic analytical approximations. If no initial information is given to\nthe players, the search is optimized for cues that cover an intermediate\nspatial scale. In addition, initial information about the extension of the cues\nresults, in general, in faster searches. Finally, strategies used by informed\nplayers turn into non-stationary processes in which the length of each\ndisplacement evolves to show a well-defined characteristic scale that is not\nfound in non-informed searches.\n", "  We present the design and characterization of waveguide grating devices that\ncouple visible-wavelength light at $\\lambda=674$ nm from single-mode, high\nindex-contrast dielectric waveguides to free-space beams forming micron-scale\ndiffraction-limited spots a designed distance and angle from the grating. With\na view to application in spatially-selective optical addressing, and in\ncontrast to previous work on similar devices, deviations from the main Gaussian\nlobe up to $25$ microns from the focus and down to the $5\\times10^{-6}$ level\nin relative intensity are characterized as well; we show that along one\ndimension the intensity of these weak sidelobes approaches the limit imposed by\ndiffraction from the finite field extent in the grating region. Additionally,\nwe characterize the polarization purity in the focal region, observing at the\ncenter of the focus a low impurity $< 3 \\times 10^{-4}$ in relative intensity.\nOur approach allows quick, intuitive design of devices with such performance,\nwhich may be applied in trapped-ion quantum information processing and\ngenerally in any systems requiring optical routing to or from objects 10s--100s\nof microns from a chip surface, but benefitting from the parallelism and\ndensity of planar-fabricated dielectric integrated optics.\n", "  Simple parameter-free analytic bias functions for the two-point correlation\nof densities in spheres at large separation are presented. These bias functions\ngeneralize the so-called Kaiser bias to the mildly non-linear regime for\narbitrary density contrasts. The derivation is carried out in the context of\nlarge deviation statistics while relying on the spherical collapse model. A\nlogarithmic transformation provides a saddle approximation which is valid for\nthe whole range of densities and shown to be accurate against the 30 Gpc cube\nstate-of-the-art Horizon Run 4 simulation. Special configurations of two\nconcentric spheres that allow to identify peaks are employed to obtain the\nconditional bias and a proxy to BBKS extrema correlation functions. These\nanalytic bias functions should be used jointly with extended perturbation\ntheory to predict two-point clustering statistics as they capture the\nnon-linear regime of structure formation at the percent level down to scales of\nabout 10 Mpc/h at redshift 0. Conversely, the joint statistics also provide us\nwith optimal dark matter two-point correlation estimates which can be applied\neither universally to all spheres or to a restricted set of biased (over- or\nunderdense) pairs. Based on a simple fiducial survey, this estimator is shown\nto perform five times better than usual two-point function estimators.\nExtracting more information from correlations of different types of objects\nshould prove essential in the context of upcoming surveys like Euclid, DESI,\nPFS or LSST.\n", "  Finding the optimal ordering of k-subsets with respect to an objective\nfunction is known to be an extremely challenging problem. In this paper we\nintroduce a new objective for this task, rooted in the problem of star\nidentification on spacecrafts: subsets of detected spikes are to be generated\nin an ordering that minimizes time to detection of a valid star constellation.\nWe carry out an extensive analysis of the combinatorial optimization problem,\nand propose multiple algorithmic solutions, offering different\nquality-complexity trade-offs. Three main approaches are investigated:\nexhaustive search (branch and prune), goal-driven (greedy scene elimination,\nminimally intersecting subsets), and stateless algorithms which implicitly seek\nto satisfy the problem's goals (pattern shifting, base unrank). In practical\nterms, these last algorithms are found to provide satisfactory approximations\nto the ideal performance levels, at small computational costs.\n", "  The ratio of branching fractions $R_{K/\\pi} \\equiv \\mathcal{B}(B_{c}^{+} \\to\nJ/\\psi K^{+})/\\mathcal{B}(B_{c}^{+} \\to J/\\psi\\pi^{+})$ is measured with $pp$\ncollision data collected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of 7\nTeV and 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n3${\\mbox{fb}^{-1}}$. It is found to be $ R_{K/\\pi} = 0.079\\pm0.007\\pm0.003$,\nwhere the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. This\nmeasurement is consistent with the previous LHCb result, while the\nuncertainties are significantly reduced.\n", "  Pure multiparticle quantum states are called absolutely maximally entangled\nif all reduced states obtained by tracing out at least half of the particles\nare maximally mixed. We provide a method to characterize these states for a\ngeneral multiparticle system. With that, we prove that a seven-qubit state\nwhose three-body marginals are all maximally mixed, or equivalently, a pure\n$((7,1,4))_2$ quantum error correcting code, does not exist. Furthermore, we\nobtain an upper limit on the possible number of maximally mixed three-body\nmarginals and identify the state saturating the bound. This solves the\nseven-particle problem as the last open case concerning maximally entangled\nstates of qubits.\n", "  The valley degree of freedom is intrinsic to spin qubits in Si/SiGe quantum\ndots. It has been viewed alternately as a hazard, especially when the lowest\nvalley-orbit splitting is small compared to the thermal energy, or as an asset,\nmost prominently in proposals to use the valley degree of freedom itself as a\nqubit. Here we present experiments in which microwave electric field driving\ninduces transitions between both valley-orbit and spin states. We show that\nthis system is highly nonlinear and can be understood through the use of\ndressed photon-orbital states, enabling a unified understanding of the six\nmicrowave resonance lines we observe. Some of these resonances are inter-valley\nspin transitions that arise from a non-adiabatic process in which both the\nvalley and the spin degree of freedom are excited simultaneously. For these\ntransitions, involving a change in valley-orbit state, we find a tenfold\nincrease in sensitivity to electric fields and electrical noise compared to\npure spin transitions, strongly reducing the phase coherence when changes in\nvalley-orbit index are incurred. In contrast to this non-adiabatic transition,\nthe pure spin transitions, whether arising from harmonic or subharmonic\ngeneration, are shown to be adiabatic in the orbital sector. The non-linearity\nof the system is most strikingly manifest in the observation of a dynamical\nanti-crossing between a spin-flip, inter-valley transition and a three-photon\ntransition enabled by the strong nonlinearity we find in this seemly simple\nsystem.\n", "  Inspired by the recent successes in the development of two-dimensional based\ngas sensors capable of single gas molecule detection, we investigate the\nadsorption of gas molecules such as N2, NO, NO2, NH3, CO, CO2, CH4, SO2, and\nH2S on silicene nanoribbons using density functional theory and nonequilibrium\nGreen's function methods. The most stable adsorption configurations, adsorption\nsites, adsorption energies, charge transfer, quantum conductance modulation,\nand electronic band structures of all studied gas molecules on SiNRs are\nstudied. Our results indicate that NO, NO2, and SO2 are chemisorbed on SiNRs\nvia strong covalent bonds, suggesting its potential application for disposable\ngas sensors. In addition, CO and NH3 are chemisorbed on SiNRs with moderate\nadsorption energy, alluding to its suitability as a highly sensitive gas\nsensor. The quantum conductance is detectably modulated by chemisorption of gas\nmolecules which can be attributed to the charge transfer from the gas molecule\nto the SiNR. Other studied gases are physisorbed on SiNRs via van der Waals\ninteractions. It is also found that the adsorption energies are enhanced by\ndoping SiNRs with either B or N atom. Our results suggest that SiNRs show\npromise in gas molecule sensing applications.\n", "  The ability to distribute entanglement over complex quantum networks is an\nimportant step towards a quantum internet. Recently, there has been significant\ntheoretical effort, mainly focusing on the distribution of bipartite\nentanglement via a simple quantum network composed only of bipartite quantum\nchannels. There are, however, a number of quantum information processing\nprotocols based on multipartite rather than bipartite entanglement. Whereas\nmultipartite entanglement can be distributed by means of a network of bipartite\nchannels, a more natural way is to use a more general network, that is, a\nquantum broadcast network including quantum broadcast channels. In this work,\nwe present a general frame- work for deriving upper bounds on the rates at\nwhich GHZ states or multipartite private states can be distributed among a\nnumber of different parties over an arbitrary quantum broadcast network. Our\nupper bounds are written in terms of the multipartite squashed entanglement,\ncorresponding to a generalisation of recently derived bounds [K. Azuma et al.,\nNat. Commun. 7, 13523 (2016)]. We also discuss how lower bounds can be obtained\nby combining a generalisation of an aggregated quantum repeater protocol with\ngraph theoretic concepts.\n", "  Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are typically low in\nnonpolar/hydrophobic but relatively high in polar, charged, and aromatic amino\nacid compositions. Some IDPs undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in the\naqueous milieu of the living cell. The resulting phase with enhanced IDP\nconcentration can function as a major component of membraneless organelles\nthat, by creating their own IDP-rich microenvironments, stimulate critical\nbiological functions. IDP phase behaviors are governed by their amino acid\nsequences. To make progress in understanding this sequence-phase relationship,\nwe report further advances in a recently introduced application of\nrandom-phase-approximation (RPA) heteropolymer theory to account for\nsequence-specific electrostatics in IDP phase separation. Here we examine\ncomputed variations in phase behavior with respect to block length and charge\ndensity of model polyampholytes of alternating equal-length charge blocks to\ngain insight into trends observed in IDP phase separation. As a real-life\nexample, the theory is applied to rationalize/predict binodal and spinodal\nphase behaviors of the 236-residue N-terminal disordered region of RNA helicase\nDdx4 and its charge-scrambled mutant for which experimental data are available.\nFundamental differences are noted between the phase diagrams predicted by RPA\nand those predicted by mean-field Flory-Huggins and\nOverbeek-Voorn/Debye-H\\\"uckel theories. In the RPA context, a physically\nplausible dependence of relative permittivity on protein concentration can\nproduce a cooperative effect in favor of IDP-IDP attraction and thus a\nsignificant increased tendency to phase separate. Ramifications of these\nfindings for future development of IDP phase separation theory are discussed.\n", "  A relation between gravity on Poisson manifolds proposed in arXiv:1508.05706\nand Einstein gravity is investigated. The compatibility of the Poisson and\nRiemann structures defines a unique connection, the contravariant Levi-Civita\nconnection, and leads to the idea of the contravariant gravity. The\nEinstein-Hilbert-type action yields an equation of motion which is written in\nterms of the analog of the Einstein tensor, and it includes couplings between\nthe metric and the Poisson tensor. The study of the Weyl transformation reveals\nproperties of those interactions. It is argued that this theory can have an\nequivalent description as a system of Einstein gravity coupled to matter. As an\nexample, it is shown that the contravariant gravity on a two-dimensional\nPoisson manifold can be described by a real scalar field coupled to the metric\nin a specific manner.\n", "  We show that the radial acceleration relation for rotationally-supported\ngalaxies may be explained, in the absence of cold dark matter, by a\nnon-minimally coupled scalar field, whose fifth forces are partially screened\non galactic scales by the symmetron mechanism. In addition, we show that\nsufficient energy is stored in the symmetron field to explain the dynamic\nstability of galactic disks.\n", "  Phase separation in strained and strain-free samples of Fe84.85Cr15.15\ninduced by an isothermal annealing at 402 deg C up to 3888 h was studied by\nmeans of the Mossbauer spectroscopy. The measured Fe-site spectra were analyzed\nwith two different procedures viz. a hyperfine field distribution and a\ntwo-shell superposition methods. Information relevant to the kinetics of the\nseparation process, concentration of Cr in Fe-rich phase, short-range ordering\nand magnetic texture was obtained based on values of spectral parameters. In\nparticular, the following quantities pertinent to the kinetics were found: the\nactivation energy, equal to 1666 kJ per mol for the strained sample, and to\n1388 kJ per mol for the strain-relaxed one, the Avrami exponent n=2.5(2) for\nboth samples, the rate constant equal to 0.0011(1) for the strained and to\n0.0028(1) per hour for the strained-free samples, respectively. The\nconcentration of Cr in the Fe-rich phase was revealed to be 11.6(4) at. % for\nthe strained sample, and to 13.2(4) at.% for the strain-free one. Significant\ndifferences in the values of the short-range parameters were revealed for the\ntwo samples. An average angle between the magnetization vector and the normal\nto the sample surface was equal to 52.7 deg for the strained sample, and to\n57.5 deg for the strain-relaxed one.\n", "  Based on a recently proposed $q$-dependent detrended cross-correlation\ncoefficient $\\rho_q$, we generalize the concept of minimum spanning tree (MST)\nby introducing a family of $q$-dependent minimum spanning trees ($q$MST) that\nare selective to cross-correlations between different fluctuation amplitudes\nand different time scales. They inherit this ability directly from the\ncoefficients $\\rho_q$ that are processed here to construct a distance matrix.\nConventional MST with detrending corresponds in this context to $q=2$. We apply\nthe $q$MSTs to sample empirical data from the stock market and discuss the\nresults. We show that the $q$MST graphs can complement $\\rho_q$ in\ndisentangling correlations that cannot be observed by the MST graphs based on\n$\\rho_{\\rm DCCA}$ and, therefore, they can be useful in many areas where the\nmultivariate cross-correlations are of interest. We apply our method to data\nfrom the stock market and obtain more information about correlation structure\nof the data than by using $q=2$ only. We show that two sets of signals that\ndiffer from each other statistically can give comparable trees for $q=2$, while\nonly by using the trees for $q \\ne 2$ we become able to distinguish between\nthese sets. We also show that a family of $q$MSTs for a range of $q$ express\nthe diversity of correlations in a manner resembling the multifractal analysis,\nwhere one computes a spectrum of the generalized fractal dimensions, the\ngeneralized Hurst exponents, or the multifractal singularity spectra: the more\ndiverse the correlations are, the more variable the tree topology is for\ndifferent $q$s. Our analysis exhibits that the stocks belonging to the same or\nsimilar industrial sectors are correlated via the fluctuations of moderate\namplitudes, while the largest fluctuations often happen to synchronize in those\nstocks that do not necessarily belong to the same industry.\n", "  Owing to its peculiar energy dispersion, the quantum capacitance property of\ngraphene can be exploited in a two-dimensional layered capacitor configuration.\nUsing graphene and boron nitride respectively as the electrodes and the\ninsulating dielectric, a strongly nonlinear behavior at zero bias and small\nvoltages is obtained. When the temperature is sufficiently low, the strong\nnonlinear interaction emerging from the quantum capacitance exhibits a diverse\nrange of phenomena. The proposed structure could take over the functionalities\nof nonlinear elements in many cryogenic quantum systems, and in particular,\nquantum electro-optics. It is shown that ultrastrong coupling is easily reached\nwith small number of pump photons at temperatures around 1K and capacitor areas\nof the order of $1\\mu{\\textrm{m}}^2$. A measure of anharmonicity is defined and\nas potential applications, a qubit design as well as schemes for non-reciprocal\ndevices such as an electromagnetic frequency circulator are discussed.\n", "  We show that the quantum Zeno effect gives rise to the Hall effect by\ntailoring the Hilbert space of a two-dimensional lattice system into a single\nBloch band with a nontrivial Berry curvature. Consequently, a wave packet\nundergoes transverse motion in response to a potential gradient -- a phenomenon\nwe call the Zeno Hall effect to highlight its quantum Zeno origin. The Zeno\nHall effect leads to retroreflection at the edge of the system due to an\ninterplay between the band flatness and the nontrivial Berry curvature. We\npropose an experimental implementation of this effect with ultracold atoms in\nan optical lattice.\n", "  We present firstly equation of motion for the photon coupled to Weyl tensor\nin a Kerr black hole spacetime and then study further the corresponding strong\ngravitational lensing. We find that black hole rotation makes propagation of\nthe coupled photons more complicated, which brings some new features for\nphysical quantities including the marginally circular photon orbit, the\ndeflection angle, the observational gravitational lensing variables and the\ntime delay between two relativistic images. There is a critical value of the\ncoupling parameter for existence of the marginally circular photon orbit\noutside the event horizon, which depends on the rotation parameter of black\nhole and the polarization direction of photons. As the value of coupling\nparameter is near the critical value, we find that the marginally circular\nphoton orbit for the retrograde photon increases with the rotation parameter,\nwhich modifies a common feature of the marginally circular photon orbit in a\nrotating black hole spacetime since it always decreases monotonously with the\nrotation parameter in the case without Weyl coupling. Combining with the\nsupermassive central object in our Galaxy, we estimated the observables\nincluding time delays between the relativistic images in the strong\ngravitational lensing as the photons couple to Weyl tensor.\n", "  The position of a Martian lander is affected by different aspects of Mars'\nrotational motions: the nutations, the precession, the length-of-day variations\nand the polar motion. These various motions have a different signature in a\nDoppler observable between the Earth and a lander on Mars' surface. Knowing the\ncorrelations between these signatures and the moments when these signatures are\nnot null during one day or on a longer timescale is important to identify\nstrategies that maximize the geophysical return of observations with a geodesy\nexperiment, in particular for the ones on-board the future NASA InSight or\nESA-Roscosmos ExoMars2020 missions.\n  We provide first-order formulations of the signature of the rotation\nparameters in the Doppler and range observables. These expressions are\nfunctions of the diurnal rotation of Mars, the lander position, the planet\nradius and the rotation parameter. Additionally, the nutation signature in the\nDoppler observable is proportional to the Earth declination with respect to\nMars.\n  For a lander on Mars close to the equator, the motions with the largest\nsignature in the Doppler observable are due to the length-of-day variations,\nthe precession rate and the rigid nutations. The polar motion and the liquid\ncore signatures have a much smaller amplitude. For a lander closer to the pole,\nthe polar motion signature is enhanced while the other signatures decrease.\n  We also numerically evaluate the amplitudes of the rotation parameters\nsignature in the Doppler observable for landers on other planets or moons.\n", "  We analyze theoretically the charging current into, and the transport current\nthrough, a nanoscale two-dimensional electron system with two parallel quantum\ndots embedded in a short wire placed in a photon cavity. A plunger gate is used\nto place specific many-body states of the interacting system in the bias window\ndefined by the external leads. We show how the transport phenomena active in\nthe many-level complex central system strongly depend on the gate voltage. We\nidentify a resonant transport through the central system as the two spin\ncomponents of the one-electron ground state are in the bias window. This\nresonant transport through the lowest energy electron states seems to a large\nextent independent of the detuned photon field when judged from the transport\ncurrent. This could be expected in the small bias regime, but an observation of\nthe occupancy of the states of the system reveals that this picture is not\nentirely true. The current does not reflect slower photon-active internal\ntransitions bringing the system into the steady state. The number of initially\npresent photons determines when the system reaches the real steady state. With\ntwo-electron states in the bias window we observe a more complex situation with\nintermediate radiative and nonradiative relaxation channels leading to a steady\nstate with a weak nonresonant current caused by inelastic tunneling through the\ntwo-electron ground state of the system. The presence of the radiative channels\nmakes this phenomena dependent on the number of photons initially in the\ncavity.\n", "  A unified equation of state for quark-hadron matter is presented in the\ngeneralized Beth-Uhlenbeck form. It follows from a $\\Phi-$derivable approach to\nthe thermodynamic potential where the ansatz for the $\\Phi$ functional contains\nall 2PI diagrams at two-loop order formed with quark cluster Green's functions\nfor quark, diquark, meson and baryon propagators. We present numerical results\nusing an effective model for the generic behaviour of hadron masses and phase\nshifts at finite temperature which shares basic features with recent\ndevelopments within the PNJL model for correlations in quark matter. We obtain\nthe transition between a hadron resonance gas phase and the quark gluon plasma\nwhere the Mott dissociation of hadrons is encoded in the hadronic phase shifts.\nThe resulting thermodynamics is in very good agreement with recent lattice QCD\nsimulations.\n", "  We study the functional renormalization group of a three-dimensional\ntensorial Group Field Theory (GFT) with gauge group SU(2). This model generates\n(generalized) lattice gauge theory amplitudes, and is known to be\nperturbatively renormalizable up to order 6 melonic interactions. We consider a\nseries of truncations of the exact Wetterich--Morris equation, which retain\nincreasingly many perturbatively irrelevant melonic interactions. This\ntensorial analogue of the ordinary local potential approximation allows to\ninvestigate the existence of non-perturbative fixed points of the\nrenormalization group flow. Our main finding is a candidate ultraviolet fixed\npoint, whose qualitative features are reproduced in all the truncations we have\nchecked (with up to order 12 interactions). This may be taken as evidence for\nan ultraviolet completion of this GFT in the sense of asymptotic safety.\nMoreover, this fixed point has a single relevant direction, which suggests the\npresence of two distinct infrared phases. Our results generally support the\nexistence of GFT phases of the condensate type, which have recently been\nconjectured and applied to quantum cosmology and black holes.\n", "  Free fermions form a Fermi surface, which results in non-zero spectral weight\nat low energy and finite wavevector. In this work, we find similar features in\nholographic phases dual to strongly coupled quantum superfluid matter. At zero\ntemperature, the phases we consider exhibit semi-local criticality in the IR\nand all the charge is carried by the scalar condensate outside the black hole\nhorizon. Depending on the value taken by the IR critical exponents, we find\nFermi surfaces in the transverse sector, Fermi shells in the longitudinal\nsector or no spectral weight at all. When there is non-zero transverse spectral\nweight, the IR can be subject to an instability at finite wavevector, the\nendpoint of which is likely a spatially modulated phase.\n", "  We suggest that Cobalt-Oxychalcogenide layers constructed by vertex sharing\nCoA$_2$O$_2$ (A=S,Se,Te) tetrahedra, such as BaCoAO, are strongly correlated\nmulti-orbital electron systems that can provide important clues on the cause of\nunconventional superconductivity. Differing from cuprates and iron-based\nsuperconductors, these systems lack of the C$_4$ rotational symmetry. However,\ntheir parental compounds possess antiferromagnetic(AFM) Mott insulating states\nthrough pure superexchange interactions and the low energy physics near Fermi\nsurfaces upon doping is also attributed mainly to the three t$_{2g}$ orbitals\nthat dominate the AFM interactions. We derive a low energy effective model for\nthese systems and predict that a d-wave-like superconducting state with\nreasonable high transition temperature can emerge by suppressing the AFM\nordering even if the pairing symmetry can not be classified by the rotational\nsymmetry any more.\n", "  Transport in strongly-disordered, metallic systems is governed by diffusive\nprocesses. Based on quantum mechanics, it has been conjectured that these\ndiffusivities obey a lower bound $D/v^2\\gtrsim \\hbar/k_B T$, the saturation of\nwhich provides a mechanism for the T-linear resistivity of bad metals. This\nbound features a characteristic velocity $v$, which was later argued to be the\nbutterfly velocity $v_B$, based on holographic models of transport. This\nestablishes a link between incoherent metallic transport, quantum chaos and\nPlanckian timescales. Here we study higher derivative corrections to an\neffective holographic action of homogeneous disorder. The higher derivative\nterms involve only the charge and translation symmetry breaking sector. We show\nthat they have a strong impact on the bound on charge diffusion\n$D_c/v_B^2\\gtrsim \\hbar/k_B T$, by potentially making the coefficient of its\nright-hand side arbitrarily small. On the other hand, the bound on energy\ndiffusion is not affected.\n", "  The initial mass function of the first, Population III (Pop III), stars plays\na vital role in shaping galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe.\nOne key remaining issue is the final fate of secondary protostars formed in the\naccretion disc, specifically whether they merge or survive. We perform a suite\nof hydrodynamic simulations of the complex interplay between fragmentation,\nprotostellar accretion, and merging inside dark matter minihaloes. Instead of\nthe traditional sink particle method, we employ a stiff equation of state\napproach, so that we can more robustly ascertain the viscous transport inside\nthe disc. The simulations show inside-out fragmentation because the gas\ncollapses faster in the central region. Fragments migrate on the viscous\ntimescale, over which angular momentum is lost, enabling them to move towards\nthe disc centre, where merging with the primary protostar can occur. This\nprocess depends on the fragmentation scale, such that there is a maximum scale\nof $(1 - 5) \\times 10^4$ au, inside which fragments can migrate to the primary\nprotostar. Viscous transport is active until radiative feedback from the\nprimary protostar destroys the accretion disc. The final mass spectrum and\nmultiplicity thus crucially depends on the effect of viscosity in the disc. The\nentire disc is subjected to efficient viscous transport in the primordial case\nwith viscous parameter $\\alpha \\le 1$. An important aspect of this question is\nthe survival probability of Pop III binary systems, possible gravitational wave\nsources to be probed with the Advanced LIGO detectors.\n", "  We report on the observation of magnetoresistance oscillations in graphene\np-n junctions. The oscillations have been observed for six samples, consisting\nof single-layer and bilayer graphene, and persist up to temperatures of 30 K,\nwhere standard Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are no longer discernible. The\noscillatory magnetoresistance can be reproduced by tight-binding simulations.\nWe attribute this phenomenon to the modulated densities of states in the n- and\np- regions.\n", "  In this work we study the Thermodynamics of D-dimensional Schwarzschild-anti\nde Sitter (SAdS) black holes. The minimal Thermodynamics of the SAdS spacetime\nis briefly discussed, highlighting some of its strong points and shortcomings.\nThe minimal SAdS Thermodynamics is extended within a Hamiltonian approach, by\nmeans of the introduction of an additional degree of freedom. We demonstrate\nthat the cosmological constant can be introduced in the thermodynamic\ndescription of the SAdS black hole with a canonical transformation of the\nSchwarzschild problem, closely related to the introduction of an anti-de Sitter\nthermodynamic volume. The treatment presented is consistent, in the sense that\nit is compatible with the introduction of new thermodynamic potentials, and\nrespects the laws of black hole Thermodynamics. By demanding homogeneity of the\nthermodynamic variables, we are able to construct a new equation of state that\ncompletely characterizes the Thermodynamics of SAdS black holes. The treatment\nnaturally generates phenomenological constants that can be associated with\ndifferent boundary conditions in underlying microscopic theories. A whole new\nset of phenomena can be expected from the proposed generalization of SAdS\nThermodynamics.\n", "  We present an updated study of transverse single-spin asymmetries for the\ninclusive large-$P_T$ processes $\\ell \\, p^\\uparrow \\to h\\, X$ and $\\ell\\,\np^\\uparrow \\to {\\rm jet}\\,X$, within a transverse momentum-dependent approach,\nincluding the contribution of quasireal (Weizs\\\"acker-Williams) photons. In the\nspirit of a unified transverse momentum-dependent scheme, predictions are\nobtained adopting the Sivers and transversity distributions and the Collins\nfragmentation functions as extracted from fits to the azimuthal asymmetries\nmeasured in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and $e^+e^-$ annihilation\nprocesses. The description of the available data is extremely good, showing a\nclear general improvement with respect to the previous leading-order analysis.\nPredictions for unpolarized cross sections and single-spin asymmetries for\nongoing and future experiments are also given.\n", "  Pseudocapacitors are energy-storage devices characterized by fast and\nreversible redox reactions that enable them to store large amounts of\nelectrical energy at high rates. We simulate the response of pseudocapacitive\nelectrodes under realistic conditions to identify the microscopic factors that\ndetermine their performance, focusing on ruthenia (RuO2) as a prototypical\nelectrode material. Electronic-structure methods are used together with a\nself-consistent continuum solvation (SCCS) model to build a complete dataset of\nfree energies as the surface of the charged electrode is gradually covered with\nprotons under applied voltage. The resulting dataset is exploited to compute\nhydrogen-adsorption isotherms and charge-voltage responses by means of\ngrand-canonical sampling, finding close agreement with experimental\nvoltammetry. These simulations reveal that small changes on the order of 5\n{\\mu}F/cm2 in the intrinsic double-layer capacitance of the\nelectrode-electrolyte interface can induce variations of up to 40 {\\mu}F/cm2 in\nthe overall pseudocapacitance.\n", "  In this paper, the model of interaction is studied between $f(T,\\mathcal{T})$\ngravity and modified Chaplygin gas in FRW-flat metric. We obtain the Friedmann\nequations in the framework of teleparallel gravity by vierbein field. We\nconsider that Universe dominates by components of cold matter, dark energy and\nmodified Chaplygin gas. In what follows we separately write the corresponding\ncontinuity equations for components of Universe. Also, dark energy EoS and\neffective EoS are obtained with respect to redshift, thereafter the\ncorresponding cosmological parameters are plotted in terms of redshift,\nthereinafter the accelerated expansion of the Universe is investigated.\nFinally, the stability of the model is discussed in phase plane analysis.\n", "  We modify the nonlinear shallow water equations, the Korteweg-de Vries\nequation, and the Whitham equation, to permit constant vorticity, and examine\nwave breaking, or the lack thereof. By wave breaking, we mean that the solution\nremains bounded but its slope becomes unbounded in finite time. We show that a\nsolution of the vorticity-modified shallow water equations breaks if it carries\nan increase of elevation; the breaking time decreases to zero as the size of\nvorticity increases. We propose a full-dispersion shallow water model, which\ncombines the dispersion relation of water waves and the nonlinear shallow water\nequations in the constant vorticity setting, and which extends the Whitham\nequation to permit bidirectional propagation. We show that its small amplitude\nand periodic traveling wave is unstable to long wavelength perturbations if the\nwave number is greater than a critical value, and stable otherwise, similarly\nto the Benjamin-Feir instability in the irrotational setting; the critical wave\nnumber grows unboundedly large with the size of vorticity. The result agrees\nwith that from a multiple scale expansion of the physical problem. We show that\nvorticity considerably alters the modulational stability and instability in the\npresence of the effects of surface tension.\n", "  We study the substructure content of the strong gravitational lens\nRXJ1131-1231 through a forward modelling approach that relies on generating an\nextensive suite of realistic simulations. We use a semi-analytic merger tree\nprescription that allows us to stochastically generate substructure populations\nwhose properties depend on the dark matter particle mass. These synthetic halos\nare then used as lenses to produce realistic mock images that have the same\nfeatures, e.g. luminous arcs, quasar positions, instrumental noise and PSF, as\nthe data. We then analyse the data and the simulations in the same way with\nsummary statistics that are sensitive to the signal being targeted and are able\nto constrain models of dark matter statistically using Approximate Bayesian\nComputing (ABC) techniques. In this work, we focus on the thermal relic mass\nestimate and fix the semi-analytic descriptions of the substructure evolution\nbased on recent literature. We are able, based on the HST data for\nRXJ1131-1231, to rule out a warm dark matter thermal relic mass below 2 keV at\nthe 2$\\sigma$ confidence level.\n", "  We show that the transition between a ETH phase and a many-body localized\nphase is marked by the different finite size scaling behaviour of the decay of\nthe Loschmidt Echo and its temporal fluctuations - after a quantum quench - in\nthe infinite time limit, despite the fact that the finite time behaviour of\nsuch quantities is dramatically different approach the MBL phase, so that\ntemporal fluctuations cannot be inferred from the infinite time average of the\nLoschmidt Echo. We also show the different scrambling powers of ETH and MBL\nHamiltonians as a probe to the different approaches to equilibrium.\n", "  The Hamiltonian of the quantum Calogero-Sutherland model of $N$ identical\nparticles on the circle with $1/r^{2}$ interactions has eigenfunctions\nconsisting of Jack polynomials times the base state. By use of the generalized\nJack polynomials taking values in modules of the symmetric group and the matrix\nsolution of a system of linear differential equations one constructs novel\neigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. Like the usual wavefunctions each\neigenfunction determines a symmetric probability density on the $N$-torus. The\nconstruction applies to any irreducible representation of the symmetric group.\nThe methods depend on the theory of generalized Jack polynomials due to\nGriffeth, and the Yang-Baxter graph approach of Luque and the author.\n", "  We propose an extension of the cable equation by introducing a Caputo time\nfractional derivative. The fundamental solutions of the most common boundary\nproblems are derived analitically via Laplace Transform, and result be written\nin terms of known special functions. This generalization could be useful to\ndescribe anomalous diffusion phenomena with leakage as signal conduction in\nspiny dendrites. The presented solutions are computed in Matlab and plotted.\n", "  Recently a paper on the construction of consistent Wigner functions for\ncylindrical phase spaces S^1 x R, i.e. for the canonical pair angle and angular\nmomentum, was presented (arXiv:1601.02520), main properties of those functions\nderived, discussed and their usefulness illustrated by examples. The present\npaper is a continuation which compares properties of the new Wigner functions\nfor cylindrical phase spaces with those of the well-known Wigner functions on\nplanar ones in more detail. Furthermore, the mutual (Weyl) correspondence\nbetween Hilbert space operators and their phase space functions is discussed.\nThe star product formalism is shown to be completely implementable. In addition\nbasic dynamical laws for the new Wigner and Moyal functions are derived as\ngeneralized quantum Liouville and energy equations. They are very similar to\nthose of the planar case, but also show characteristic differences.\n", "  The transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) spectra in proton-proton collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, measured by the ALICE experiment at the LHC are analyzed\nwith a thermodynamically consistent Tsallis distribution. The information about\nthe freeze-out surface in terms of freeze-out volume, temperature and the\nnon-extenisivity parameter, $q$, for $K^{0}_{S}$, $\\Lambda+\\bar{\\Lambda}$,\n$\\Xi^{-}+\\bar{\\Xi}^{+}$ and $\\Omega^{-}+\\bar{\\Omega}^{+}$ are extracted by\nfitting the $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra with Tsallis distribution function. The\nfreeze-out parameters of these particles are studied as a function of charged\nparticle multiplicity density ($dN_{ch}/d\\eta$). In addition, we also study\nthese parameters as a function of particle mass to see any possible mass\nordering. The strange and multi-strange particles show mass ordering in volume,\ntemperature, non-extensive parameter and also a strong dependence on\nmultiplicity classes. It is observed that with increase in particle\nmultiplicity, the non-extensivity parameter, $q$ decreases, which indicates the\ntendency of the produced system towards thermodynamic equilibration. The\nincrease in strange particle multiplicity is observed to be due to the increase\nof temperature and not to the size of the freeze-out volume.\n", "  We study the scalar-tensor theory of gravity profoundly in the action level\nas well as in the thermodynamic level. Contrary to the usual description in the\nliterature about the equivalence in the two conformally connected frames, this\npaper addresses several incomplete inferences regarding it and mentions some\ninequivalences which were not pointed out earlier. In the thermodynamic level,\nour analysis shows the two frames are equivalent. In that process, we identify\nthe entropy, the energy and the temperature for the thermodynamic description,\nand we find these quantities are conformally invariant even without any prior\nassumption. The same conclusion is reached from the gravitational action as\nwell as from the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term, establishing the result in\na more convincing manner.\n", "  We have computed the surface energies, work functions, and interlayer surface\nrelaxations of clean (111), (110), and (100) surfaces of Al, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd,\nAg, Pt, and Au. Many of these metallic surfaces have technological or catalytic\napplications. We compare experimental reference values to those of the local\ndensity approximation (LDA), the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized\ngradient approximation (GGA), the PBEsol (PBE for solids) GGA, the SCAN\nmeta-GGA, and SCAN+rVV10 (SCAN with a long-range van der Waals or vdW\ncorrection). The closest agreement with uncertain experimental values is\nachieved by the simplest density functional (LDA) and by the most sophisticated\ngeneral-purpose one (SCAN+rVV10). The long-range vdW interaction increases the\nsurface energies by about 10%, and the work functions by about 1%. LDA works\nfor metal surfaces through a stronger-than-usual error cancellation. PBE yields\nthe most-underestimated and presumably least accurate surface energies and work\nfunctions. Surface energies within the random phase approximation (RPA) are\nalso reported. Interlayer relaxations from different functionals are in\nreasonable agreement with one another, and usually with experiment.\n", "  In the continuation of our previous work, the transverse momentum ($p_T$)\nspectra and nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) are derived using relaxation\ntime approximation of Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). The initial\n$p_T$-distribution used to describe $p+p$ collisions has been studied with the\npQCD inspired power-law distribution, the Hagedorn's empirical formula and with\nthe Tsallis non-extensive statistical distribution. The non-extensive Tsallis\ndistribution is observed to describe the complete range of the transverse\nmomentum spectra. The Boltzmann-Gibbs Blast Wave (BGBW) distribution is used as\nthe equilibrium distribution in the present formalism, to describe the\n$p_T$-distribution and nuclear modification factor in nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions. The experimental data for Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =\n2.76 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN have been analyzed for pions,\nkaons, protons, $K^{*0}$ and $\\phi$. It is observed that the present formalism\nwhile explaining the transverse momentum spectra upto 5 GeV/c, explains the\nnuclear modification factor very well upto 8 GeV/c in $p_T$ for all these\nparticles except for protons. $R_{AA}$ is found to be independent of the degree\nof non-extensivity, $q_{pp}$ after $p_T \\sim$ 8 GeV/c.\n", "  We investigate the nature of far-infrared (70 um) and hard X-ray (3-24 keV)\nselected galaxies in the COSMOS field detected with both Spitzer and Nuclear\nSpectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). By matching the Spitzer-COSMOS catalog\nagainst the NuSTAR-COSMOS catalog, we obtain a sample consisting of a\nhyperluminous infrared galaxy with log(L_IR/L_sun) > 13, 12 ultraluminous\ninfrared galaxies with 12 < log(L_IR/L_sun) < 13, and 10 luminous infrared\ngalaxies with 11 < log(L_IR/L_sun) < 12, i.e., 23 Hy/U/LIRGs in total. Using\ntheir X-ray hardness ratios, we find that 12 sources are obscured active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) with absorption column densities of N_H > 10^22 cm^-2,\nincluding several Compton-thick (N_H ~ 10^24 cm^-2) AGN candidates. On the\nbasis of the infrared (60 um) and intrinsic X-ray luminosities, we examine the\nrelation between star-formation (SF) and AGN luminosities of the 23 Hy/U/LIRGs.\nWe find that the correlation is similar to that of optically-selected AGNs\nreported by Netzer (2009), whereas local, far-infrared selected U/LIRGs show\nhigher SF-to-AGN luminosity ratios than the average of our sample. This result\nsuggests that our Hy/U/LIRGs detected both with Spitzer and NuSTAR are likely\nsituated in a transition epoch between AGN-rising and cold-gas diminishing\nphases in SF-AGN evolutional sequences. The nature of a Compton-thick AGN\ncandidate newly detected above 8 keV with NuSTAR (ID 245 in Civano et al. 2015)\nis briefly discussed.\n", "  Observations in the solar wind suggest that the compressive component of\ninertial-range solar-wind turbulence is dominated by slow modes. The low\ncollisionality of the solar wind allows for non-thermal features to survive,\nwhich suggests the requirement of a kinetic plasma description. The\nleast-damped kinetic slow mode is associated with the ion-acoustic (IA) wave\nand a non-propagating (NP) mode. We derive analytical expressions for the\nIA-wave dispersion relation in an anisotropic plasma in the framework of\ngyrokinetics and then compare them to fully-kinetic numerical calculations,\nresults from two-fluid theory, and MHD. This comparison shows major\ndiscrepancies in the predicted wave phase speeds from MHD and kinetic theory at\nmoderate to high $\\beta$. MHD and kinetic theory also dictate that all plasma\nnormal modes exhibit a unique signature in terms of their polarization. We\nquantify the relative amplitude of fluctuations in the three lowest particle\nvelocity moments associated with IA and NP modes in the gyrokinetic limit and\ncompare these predictions with MHD results and in-situ observations of the\nsolar-wind turbulence. The agreement between the observations of the wave\npolarization and our MHD predictions is better than the kinetic predictions,\nsuggesting that the plasma behaves more like a fluid in the solar wind than\nexpected.\n", "  The SHiP experiment is designed to search for very weakly interacting\nparticles beyond the Standard Model which are produced in a 400 GeV/c proton\nbeam dump at the CERN SPS. An essential task for the experiment is to keep the\nStandard Model background level to less than 0.1 event after $2\\times 10^{20}$\nprotons on target. In the beam dump, around $10^{11}$ muons will be produced\nper second. The muon rate in the spectrometer has to be reduced by at least\nfour orders of magnitude to avoid muon-induced combinatorial background. A\nnovel active muon shield is used to magnetically deflect the muons out of the\nacceptance of the spectrometer. This paper describes the basic principle of\nsuch a shield, its optimization and its performance.\n", "  The cross section of high-energy $e^+e^-$ pair production by a heavy charged\nparticle in the atomic field is investigated in detail. We take into account\nthe interaction with the atomic field of $e^+e^-$ pair and a heavy particle as\nwell. The calculation is performed exactly in the parameters of the atomic\nfield. It is shown that, in contrast to the commonly accepted point of view,\nthe cross section differential with respect to the final momentum of a heavy\nparticle is strongly affected by the interaction of a heavy particle with the\natomic field. However, the cross section integrated over the final momentum of\na heavy particle is independent of this interaction.\n", "  We present the mid-infrared (MIR) light curves (LCs) of a tidal disruption\nevent (TDE) candidate in the center of a nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxy\n(ULIRG) F01004-2237 using archival {\\it WISE} and {\\it NEOWISE} data from 2010\nto 2016. At the peak of the optical flare, F01004-2237 was IR quiescent. About\nthree years later, its MIR fluxes have shown a steady increase, rising by 1.34\nand 1.04 mag in $3.4$ and $4.6\\mu$m up to the end of 2016. The host-subtracted\nMIR peak luminosity is $2-3\\times10^{44}$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$. We interpret the MIR\nLCs as an infrared echo, i.e. dust reprocessed emission of the optical flare.\nFitting the MIR LCs using our dust model, we infer a dust torus of the size of\na few parsecs at some inclined angle. The derived dust temperatures range from\n$590-850$\\,K, and the warm dust mass is $\\sim7\\,M_{\\odot}$. Such a large mass\nimplies that the dust cannot be newly formed. We also derive the UV luminosity\nof $4-11\\times10^{44}$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$. The inferred total IR energy is\n$1-2\\times10^{52}$\\,erg, suggesting a large dust covering factor. Finally, our\ndust model suggests that the long tail of the optical flare could be due to\ndust scattering.\n", "  Living cells use phase separation and concentration gradients to organize\nchemical compartments in space. Here, we present a theoretical study of droplet\ndynamics in gradient systems. We derive the corresponding growth law of\ndroplets and find that droplets exhibit a drift velocity and position dependent\ngrowth. As a consequence, the dissolution boundary moves through the system,\nthereby segregating droplets to one end. We show that for steep enough\ngradients, the ripening leads to a transient arrest of droplet growth that is\ninduced by an narrowing of the droplet size distribution.\n", "  As affordability pressures and tight rental markets in global cities mount,\nonline shared accommodation sites proliferate. Home sharing arrangements\npresent dilemmas for planning that aims to improve health and safety standards,\nwhile supporting positives such as the usage of dormant stock and the relieving\nof rental pressures on middle/lower income earners. Currently, no formal data\nexists on this internationally growing trend. Here, we present a first\nquantitative glance on shared accommodation practices across all major urban\ncenters of Australia enabled via collection and analysis of thousands of online\nlistings. We examine, countrywide, the spatial and short time scale temporal\ncharacteristics of this market, along with preliminary analysis on rents,\ndwelling types and other characteristics. Findings have implications for\nhousing policy makers and planning practitioners seeking to monitor and respond\nto housing policy and affordability pressures in formal and informal housing\nmarkets.\n", "  Mid infrared (MIR) photonics is a key region for molecular physics [1].\nHigh-resolution spectroscopy in the 1--10 {\\mu}m region, though, has never been\nfully tackled for the lack of widely-tunable and practical light sources.\nIndeed, all solutions proposed thus far suffer from at least one of three\nissues: they are feasible only in a narrow spectral range; the power available\nfor spectroscopy is limited; the frequency accuracy is poor. Here, we present a\nsetup for high-resolution spectroscopy that can be applied in the whole 1--10\n{\\mu}m range by combining the power of quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) and the\naccuracy achievable by difference frequency generation using an OP-GaP crystal.\nThe frequency is measured against a primary frequency standard using the\nItalian metrological fibre link network. We demonstrate the performance of the\nsetup by measuring a vibrational transition in a highly-excited metastable\nstate of CO around 6 {\\mu}m with 11 digits of precision, four orders of\nmagnitude better than the value available in the literature [2].\n", "  After the discovery of the top quark more than 20 years ago, its properties\nhave been studied in great detail both in production and in decay. Increasingly\nsophisticated experimental results from the Fermilab Tevatron and from Run 1\nand Run 2 of the LHC at CERN are complemented by very precise theoretical\npredictions in the framework of the standard model of particle physics and\nbeyond. In this article the current status of top-quark physics is reviewed,\nfocusing on experimental results, and a perspective of top-quark physics at the\nLHC and at future colliders is given.\n", "  We consider systems of $N$ bosons in a box with volume one, interacting\nthrough a repulsive two-body potential of the form $\\kappa N^{3\\beta-1}\nV(N^\\beta x)$. For all $0 < \\beta < 1$, and for sufficiently small coupling\nconstant $\\kappa > 0$, we establish the validity of Bogoliubov theory,\nidentifying the ground state energy and the low-lying excitation spectrum up to\nerrors that vanish in the limit of large $N$.\n", "  Effect of airfoil thickness on onset of dynamic stall is investigated using\nlarge eddy simulations at chord-based Reynolds number of 200,000. Four\nsymmetric NACA airfoils of thickness-to-chord ratios of 9%, 12%, 15%, and 18%\nare studied. The 3-D Navier Stokes solver, FDL3DI is used with a sixth-order\ncompact finite difference scheme for spatial discretization, second-order\nimplicit time integration, and discriminating filters to remove unresolved\nwavenumbers. A constant-rate pitch-up maneuver is studied with the pitching\naxis located at the airfoil quarter chord point. Simulations are performed in\ntwo steps. In the first step, the airfoil is kept static at a prescribed angle\nof attack ($=4^\\circ$). In the second step, a ramp function is used to smoothly\nincrease the pitch rate from zero to the selected value and then the pitch rate\nis held constant until the angle of attack goes past the lift stall point.\nComparisons against XFOIL for the static simulations show good agreement in\npredicting the transition location. FDL3DI predicts two-stage transition for\nthin airfoils (9% and 12%), which is not observed in the XFOIL results. The\ndynamic simulations show that the onset of dynamic stall is marked by the\nbursting of the laminar separation bubble (LSB) in all cases. However, for the\nthickest airfoil tested, the reverse flow region spreads over most of the\nairfoil and reaches the LSB location immediately before the LSB bursts and\ndynamic stall begins, suggesting that stall could be triggered by the separated\nturbulent boundary layer. The results suggest that the boundary between\ndifferent classifications of dynamic stall, particularly leading edge stall\nversus trailing edge stall are blurred. The dynamic stall onset mechanism\nchanges gradually from one to the other with a gradual change in some\nparameters, in this case, airfoil thickness.\n", "  MagLIF is a fairly new fusion concept using a puled-power generator as the\nmain driver. This concept uses a Z-pinch configuration where the implosion is\ndriven by the Z-machine using 27 MA of electrical current in 100 ns. Since the\nimplosion time is long compared to the heat diffusion time of a non-magnetized\nplasma, MagLIF requires an initial axial magnetic of 30T to reduce heat losses\nto the liner wall. Since the field needs to penetrate the transmission lines of\nthe pulsed-power generator, as well as the liner itself, the rise time must\nexceed tens of microseconds. Any coil capable of producing such field on that\nlong a pulse-length is inevitably bulky. The space required to house the coil\nnear the liner increase the inductance of the load, which becomes problematic\nsince the voltage at the load cannot exceed what the driver can already\nprovide. Yet, the enormous amount of current that the Z-machine can provide\ncould be used to produce the required 30 T by tilting the current posts\nsurrounding the liner. However, the field penetration is limited by the skin\neffect of the liner wall. This paper shows that when current densities are\nlarge enough, the material generate resistivity gradients which forces the\ncurrent to diffusive across the liner wall much fast than the skin time. As a\nresult, the 30T coil can be eliminated and replaced by return current posts\nwith minimal helicity.\n", "  During its active lifetime a star burns its nuclear fuel and gravitation is\nheld off by the pressure of the heated gas. Gravity should take over once this\nfuel is exhausted unless some other agency saves the star from such a fate. Low\nmass stars find peace as {\\bf \\em white dwarfs} when the electrons settle into\na Fermi degenerate phase where the pressure of degenerate electrons balance the\ngravitational pressure.\n", "  In 2013, the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency refined the\nhistorical rainfall estimates over the African Continent and produced the\nAfrican Rainfall Climate version 2.0 (ARC2) estimator. ARC2 offers a nearly\ncomplete record of daily rainfall estimates since 1983 at 0.1 x 0.1 degree\nresolution. Despite short-term anomalies in twice-yearly rainy season\nintensities in Uganda, we identify an overall decrease in average rainfall of\nabout 12% during the past 34 years. Spatiotemporally, these decreases are\ngreatest in agricultural regions of central and western Uganda, but are also\nreflective of rainfall decreases in the gorilla habitat within the Bwindi\nForest in Southwest Uganda. The findings carry significant implications for\nagriculture, food security, and wildlife habitat.\n", "  Apollonian gaskets are formed by repeatedly filling the interstices between\nfour mutually tangent circles with further tangent circles. We experimentally\nstudy the pair correlation, electrostatic energy, and nearest neighbor spacing\nof centers of circles from Apollonian gaskets. Even though the centers of these\ncircles are not uniformly distributed in any `ambient' space, after proper\nnormalization, all these statistics seem to exhibit some interesting limiting\nbehaviors.\n", "  Heterogeneous gas and solid catalyst reactions occur at the atomic level, and\nunderstanding and controlling complex catalytic reactions at this level is\ncrucial for the development of improved processes and materials. There are\npostulations that single atoms and very small clusters can act as primary\nactive sites in chemical reactions. Early applications of our novel aberration\ncorrected (AC) environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (ESTEM)\nwith single atom resolution are described. This instrument combines, for the\nfirst time, controlled operating temperatures and a continuous gas environment\naround the sample with full AC STEM capabilities for real-time in-situ analysis\nand visualization of single atoms and clusters in nano particle catalysis.\nESTEM imaging and analysis in controlled gas and temperature environments can\nprovide unique insights into catalytic reaction pathways that may involve\nmetastable intermediate states. Benefits include new knowledge and more\nenvironmentally friendly technological processes for health care and renewable\nenergy as well as improved or replacement mainstream technologies in the\nchemical and energy industries.\n", "  We study the dynamics of pairs of connected masses in the plane, when\nnonholonomic (knife-edge) constraints are realized by forces of viscous\nfriction, in particular its relation to constrained dynamics, and its\napproximation by the method of matching asymptotics of singular perturbation\ntheory when the mass to friction ratio is taken as the small parameter. It\nturns out that long term behaviors of the frictional and constrained systems\nmay differ dramatically no matter how small the perturbation is, and when this\nhappens is not determined by any transparent feature of the equations of\nmotion. The choice of effective time scales for matching asymptotics is also\nsubtle and non-obvious, and secular terms appearing in them can not be dealt\nwith by the classical methods. Our analysis is based on comparison to analytic\nsolutions, and we present a reduction procedure for plane dumbbells that leads\nto them in some cases.\n", "  We predict the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relationship for dwarf galaxies\nand their satellites residing in halos down to M$_{halo} =$ 10$^7$ M$_{\\odot}$\nwith 10$^4$ M$_{\\odot} <$ M$_{star}$($z=0$) $< 10^8$ M$_{\\odot}$, and quantify\nthe predicted scatter in the relation at the low mass end, using cosmological\nsimulations. The galaxies were drawn from a cosmological simulation of dwarf\ngalaxies, run with the N-body + SPH code, ChaNGA, at a high resolution of 60\npc. For M$_{halo} > 10^9$ M$_{\\odot}$, the simulated SMHM relationship agrees\nwith literature determinations, including exhibiting a small scatter. However,\nthe scatter in the SMHM relation increases dramatically for lower-mass halos.\nWe find that some of this scatter is due to {\\em dark dwarfs}, halos devoid of\nstars. However, even when only considering well-resolved halos that contain a\nstellar population, the scatter in stellar mass reaches nearly 1 dex for\nM$_{halo}$($z=0$) 10$^7$ M$_{\\odot}$. Much of this scatter is due to including\nsatellites of the dwarf galaxies that have had their halo masses reduced\nthrough tidal stripping. The fraction of dark dwarfs (those that contain no\nstars) increases substantially with decreasing halo mass. When these dark halos\nare considered, the true scatter in the SMHM at low masses is even larger. At\nthe faintest end of the SMHM relation probed by our simulations, a galaxy\ncannot be assigned a unique halo mass based solely on its luminosity. We\nprovide a formula to stochastically populate low-mass halos following our\nresults. Our predicted large scatter at low halo masses increases the slope of\nthe resulting stellar mass function on the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy scales\ncurrently being probed by such surveys as the Dark Energy Survey or the\nHyper-Suprime Cam Subaru Strategic Program, and in the future by the Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope.\n", "  In this essay we offer a comprehensible overview of the gravitational aether\nscenario. This is a possible extension of Einstein's theory of relativity to\nthe quantum regime via an effective approach. Quantization of gravity usually\nfaces several issues including an unexpected high vacuum energy density caused\nby quantum fluctuations. The model presented in this paper offers a solution to\nthe so-called cosmological constant problems.\n  As its name suggests, the gravitational aether introduces preferred reference\nframes, while it remains compatible with the general theory of relativity. As a\nrare feature among quantum gravity inspired theories, it can predict measurable\nastronomical and cosmological effects. Observational data disfavor the\ngravitational aether scenario at $2.6\\text{-}5\\,\\sigma$. This experimental\nfeedback gives rise to possible refinements of the theory.\n", "  We present near-infrared (0.78-2.45 {\\mu}m) reflectance spectra for nine\nmiddle and outer main belt (a > 2.5 AU) basaltic asteroids. Three of these\nobjects are spectrally distinct from all classifications in the Bus-DeMeo\nsystem and could represent spectral end members in the existing taxonomy or be\nrepresentatives of a new spectral type. The remainder of the sample are\nclassified as V- or R- type. All of these asteroids are dynamically detached\nfrom the Vesta collisional family, but are too small to be intact\ndifferentiated parent bodies, implying that they originated from differentiated\nplanetesimals which have since been destroyed or ejected from the solar system.\nThe 1- and 2-{\\mu}m band centers of all objects, determined using the Modified\nGaussian Model (MGM), were compared to those of 47 Vestoids and fifteen HED\nmeteorites of known composition. The HEDs enabled us to determine formulas\nrelating Band 1 and Band 2 centers to pyroxene ferrosilite (Fs) compositions.\nUsing these formulas we present the most comprehensive compositional analysis\nto date of middle and outer belt basaltic asteroids. We also conduct a careful\nerror analysis of the MGM-derived band centers for implementation in future\nanalyses. The six outer belt V- and R-type asteroids show more dispersion in\nparameter space than the Vestoids, reflecting greater compositional diversity\nthan Vesta and its associated bodies. The objects analyzed have Fs numbers\nwhich are, on average, between five and ten molar percent lower than those of\nthe Vestoids; however, identification and compositional analysis of additional\nouter belt basaltic asteroids would help to confirm or refute this result.\nGiven the gradient in oxidation state which existed within the solar nebula,\nthese results tentatively suggest that these objects formed at either a\ndifferent time or location than 4 Vesta.\n", "  We show that the assumption of non-zero topological susceptibility of the\nvacuum in a fermion-free version of a theory, such as gravity or QCD, suffices\nto conclude the following: Once N massless fermion flavors are added to the\ntheory, they break the chiral flavor symmetry dynamically, down to a subgroup\nthat would be anomaly-free under gauging; In both theories, the\npseudo-Goldstone corresponding to axial U(1)-symmetry becomes massive; In QCD\nas well as in gravity the massless fermions are eliminated from the low energy\nspectrum of the theory. All the above conclusions are reached without making an\nassumption about confinement. Some key methods of our approach are:\nReformulation of topological susceptibility in the language of a three-form\ngauge theory; Utilization of gravity in the role of a spectator interaction for\nthe chiral anomaly-matching in QCD; Gauging chiral symmetries and matching\ntheir anomalies using the spectator Green-Schwarz type axions. Our observations\nsuggest that breaking of chiral symmetries in QCD and in gravity can be\ndescribed in unified topological language, and seemingly-disconnected\nphenomena, such as, the generation of eta'-meson mass in QCD and breaking of\nglobal chiral symmetry by gravity may share a secret analogy. The described\nphenomenon may shed a new light - via contribution of micro black holes into\nthe gravitational topological susceptibility of the vacuum - on incompatibility\nbetween black holes and global symmetries. It appears that explicit breaking is\nnot the sole possibility, and like QCD, gravity may break global symmetries\ndynamically. As an useful byproduct, matching of gravitational anomalies\nprovides a selection tool for compositeness, eliminating possibility of\nmassless composite fermions where standard gauge anomaly matching would allow\nfor their existence.\n", "  A quantum electrodynamic calculation of the interaction of an excited-state\natom with a ground-state atom is performed. For an excited reference state and\na lower-lying virtual state, the contribution to the interaction energy\nnaturally splits into a pole term, and a Wick-rotated term. The pole term is\nshown to dominate in the long-range limit, altering the functional form of the\ninteraction from the retarded 1/R^7 Casimir-Polder form to a long-range\ntail-provided by the Wick-rotated term-proportional to cos[2 (E_m-E_n) R/(hbar\nc)]/R^2, where E_m < E_n is the energy of a virtual state, lower than the\nreference state energy E_n, and R is the interatomic separation. General\nexpressions are obtained which can be applied to atomic reference states of\narbitrary angular symmetry. Careful treatment of the pole terms in the Feynman\nprescription for the atomic polarizability is found to be crucial in obtaining\ncorrect results.\n", "  In this thesis, we study connections between metric and combinatorial graphs\nfrom a Dirichlet space point of view.\n", "  Explicitly time-dependent pseudo-Hermitian (TDPH) invariants theory systems,\nwith a time-dependent (TD) metric, is developed for a time-dependent non\nHermitian (TDNH) quantum systems. We derive a simple relation between the\neigenstates of this pseudo-Hermitien (PH) invariant and the solutions of the\nSchrodinger equation. A physical system is treated in detail: the TD Swanson\nmodel, where an explicitly TDPH invariant is derived for this system, the\neigenvalues and eigenstates of the invariant are calculated explicitly.\n", "  The superconducting phase transition in\nYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\\textit{$\\delta $}}$(YBCO) thin film samples doped with\nnon-superconducting nanodot impurities of CeO$_{2}$ are the focus of recent\nhigh-temperature superconductor studies. Non-superconducting holes of the\nsuperconducting lattice induce a bound-state of circulating paired electrons.\nThis creates a magnetic flux vortex state. Examining the flow of free-electrons\nshows that these quantized magnetic flux vortices arrange themselves in a\nself-assembled lattice. The nanodots serve to present structural properties to\nconstrict the \"creep\" of these flux vorticies under a field response in the\nform of a pinning-force enhancing the critical current density after phase\ntransition. In this work, a model for characterizing the superconducting phase\nby the work done on electron pairs and chemical potential, following the\nwell-known theories of Superconductivity (Bardeen-Cooper-Scheifer \\&\nGinzburg-Landau), is formulated and tested.A solution to the expression for the\nmagnetic flux, zero net force and pair velocity will generate a setting for the\noptimal deposition parameters of number density, growth geometry and mass\ndensity of these nanodot structures.\n", "  Neurotransmitter receptor molecules, concentrated in synaptic membrane\ndomains along with scaffolds and other kinds of proteins, are crucial for\nsignal transmission across chemical synapses. In common with other membrane\nprotein domains, synaptic domains are characterized by low protein copy numbers\nand protein crowding, with rapid stochastic turnover of individual molecules.\nWe study here in detail a stochastic lattice model of the receptor-scaffold\nreaction-diffusion dynamics at synaptic domains that was found previously to\ncapture, at the mean-field level, the self-assembly, stability, and\ncharacteristic size of synaptic domains observed in experiments. We show that\nour stochastic lattice model yields quantitative agreement with mean-field\nmodels of nonlinear diffusion in crowded membranes. Through a combination of\nanalytic and numerical solutions of the master equation governing the reaction\ndynamics at synaptic domains, together with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we\nfind substantial discrepancies between mean-field and stochastic models for the\nreaction dynamics at synaptic domains. Based on the reaction and diffusion\nproperties of synaptic receptors and scaffolds suggested by previous\nexperiments and mean-field calculations, we show that the stochastic\nreaction-diffusion dynamics of synaptic receptors and scaffolds provide a\nsimple physical mechanism for collective fluctuations in synaptic domains, the\nmolecular turnover observed at synaptic domains, key features of the observed\nsingle-molecule trajectories, and spatial heterogeneity in the effective rates\nat which receptors and scaffolds are recycled at the cell membrane. Our work\nsheds light on the physical mechanisms and principles linking the collective\nproperties of membrane protein domains to the stochastic dynamics that rule\ntheir molecular~components.\n", "  In this paper we consider the development of numerical schemes for mean-field\nequations describing the collective behavior of a large group of interacting\nagents. The schemes are based on a generalization of the classical Chang-Cooper\napproach and are capable to preserve the main structural properties of the\nsystems, namely nonnegativity of the solution, physical conservation laws,\nentropy dissipation and stationary solutions. In particular, the methods here\nderived are second order accurate in transient regimes whereas they can reach\narbitrary accuracy asymptotically for large times. Several examples are\nreported to show the generality of the approach.\n", "  OTS44 is one of only four free-floating planets known to have a disk. We have\npreviously shown that it is the coolest and least massive known free-floating\nplanet ($\\sim$12 M$_{\\rm Jup}$) with a substantial disk that is actively\naccreting. We have obtained Band 6 (233 GHz) ALMA continuum data of this very\nyoung disk-bearing object. The data shows a clear unresolved detection of the\nsource. We obtained disk-mass estimates via empirical correlations derived for\nyoung, higher-mass, central (substellar) objects. The range of values obtained\nare between 0.07 and 0.63 M$_{\\oplus}$ (dust masses). We compare the properties\nof this unique disk with those recently reported around higher-mass (brown\ndwarfs) young objects in order to infer constraints on its mechanism of\nformation. While extreme assumptions on dust temperature yield disk-mass values\nthat could slightly diverge from the general trends found for more massive\nbrown dwarfs, a range of sensible values provide disk masses compatible with a\nunique scaling relation between $M_{\\rm dust}$ and $M_{*}$ through the\nsubstellar domain down to planetary masses.\n", "  We propose a table-top method to obtain bilayer quasi-free-standing\nepitaxial-graphene (QFSEG) on SiC(0001). By applying a microwave annealing in\nair to a monolayer epitaxial graphene (EG) grown on SiC(0001), the buffer layer\nis decoupled from the SiC substrate and becomes the second EG layer as\nconfirmed by the low energy electron diffraction, high-resolution transmission\nelectron microscopy, Raman scattering spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy, and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. The most likely\nmechanism of the decoupling is given by the oxidation of the SiC surface, which\nis quite similar to what happens in conventional annealing method in air but\nwith a process time by more than one order of magnitude less.\n", "  We study enumerations of Dyck and ballot tilings, which are tilings of a\nregion determined by two Dyck or ballot paths. We give bijective proofs to two\nformulae of enumerations of Dyck tilings through Hermite histories. We show\nthat one of the formulae is equal to a certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial. For\na ballot tiling, we establish formulae which are analogues of formulae for Dyck\ntilings. Especially, the generating functions have factorized expressions. The\nkey tool is a planted plane tree and its increasing labellings. We also\nintroduce a generalized perfect matching which is bijective to an Hermite\nhistory for a ballot tiling. By combining these objects, we obtain various\nexpressions of a generating function of ballot tilings with a fixed lower path.\n", "  We introduce a new combinatorial object, semistandard increasing\ndecomposition tableau and study its relation to a semistandard decomposition\ntableau introduced by Kra\\'skiewicz and developed by Lam and Serrano. We also\nintroduce generalized Littlewood--Richardson coefficients for products of\nSchur's symmetric functions and give combinatorial descriptions in terms of\ntableau words. The insertion algorithms play central roles for proofs. A new\ndescription of shifted Littlewood--Richardson coefficients is given in terms of\nsemistandard increasing decomposition tableaux. We show that a \"big\" Schur\nfunction is expressed as a sum of products of two Schur $P$-functions, and vice\nversa. As an application, we derive two Giambelli formulae for big Schur\nfunctions: one is a determinant and the other is a Pfaffian.\n", "  Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) is one of the major AstroSat\npayloads. LAXPC instrument will provide high time resolution X-ray observations\nin 3 to 80 keV energy band with moderate energy resolution. A cluster of three\nco-aligned identical LAXPC detectors is used in AstroSat to provide large\ncollection area of more than 6000 cm2 . The large detection volume (15 cm\ndepth) filled with xenon gas at about 2 atmosphere pressure, results in\ndetection efficiency greater than 50%, above 30 keV. With its broad energy\nrange and fine time resolution (10 microsecond), LAXPC instrument is well\nsuited for timing and spectral studies of a wide variety of known and transient\nX-ray sources in the sky. We have done extensive calibration of all LAXPC\ndetectors using radioactive sources as well as GEANT4 simulation of LAXPC\ndetectors. We describe in brief some of the results obtained during the payload\nverification phase along with LXAPC capabilities.\n", "  We demonstrate simultaneous measurements of DC transport properties and flux\nnoise of a hybrid superconducting magnetometer based on the proximity effect\n(superconducting quantum interference proximity transistor, SQUIPT). The noise\nis probed by a cryogenic amplifier operating in the frequency range of a few\nMHz. In our non-optimized device, we achieve minimum flux noise $\\sim\n4\\;\\mu\\Phi_0/Hz^{1/2}$, set by the shot noise of the probe tunnel junction. The\nflux noise performance can be improved by further optimization of the SQUIPT\nparameters, primarily minimization of the proximity junction length and cross\nsection. Furthermore, the experiment demonstrates that the setup can be used to\ninvestigate shot noise in other nonlinear devices with high impedance. This\ntechnique opens the opportunity to measure sensitive magnetometers including\nSQUIPT devices with very low dissipation.\n", "  We explore the hypothesis that the classical and ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal\nsatellites of the Milky Way have been the building blocks of the Galactic halo\nby comparing their [O/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H] patterns with the ones\nobserved in Galactic halo stars. Oxygen abundances deviate substantially from\nthe observed abundances in the Galactic halo stars for [Fe/H] values larger\nthan -2 dex, while they overlap for lower metallicities. On the other hand, for\nthe [Ba/Fe] ratio the discrepancy is extended at all [Fe/H] values, suggesting\nthat the majority of stars in the halo are likely to have been formed in situ.\nTherefore, we suggest that [Ba/Fe] ratios are a better diagnostic than [O/Fe]\nratios. Moreover, we show the effects of an enriched infall of gas with the\nsame chemical abundances as the matter ejected and/or stripped from dwarf\nsatellites of the Milky Way on the chemical evolution of the Galactic halo. We\nfind that the resulting chemical abundances of the halo stars depend on the\nassumed infall time scale, and the presence of a threshold in the gas for star\nformation.\n", "  The massive evolved star Eta Carinae is the most luminous star in the Milky\nWay and has the highest steady wind mass-loss rate of any known star. Radiative\ntransfer models of the spectrum by Hillier et al. predict that H-alpha is\nmostly emitted in regions of the wind at radii of 6 to 60 AU from the star (2.5\nto 25 mas at 2.35 kpc). We present diffraction-limited images (FWHM ~25 mas)\nwith Magellan adaptive optics in two epochs, showing that Eta Carinae\nconsistently appears ~2.5 to 3 mas wider in H-alpha emission compared to the\nadjacent 643 nm continuum. This implies that the H-alpha line-forming region\nmay have a characteristic emitting radius of 12 mas or ~30 AU, in very good\nagreement with the Hillier stellar-wind model. This provides direct\nconfirmation that the physical wind parameters of that model are roughly\ncorrect, including the mass-loss rate of 10^-3 M_sun/yr, plus the clumping\nfactor, and the terminal velocity. Comparison of the H-alpha images\n(ellipticity and PA) to the continuum images reveals no significant asymmetries\nat H-alpha. Hence, any asymmetry induced by a companion or by the primary's\nrotation do not strongly influence the global H-alpha emission in the outer\nwind.\n", "  We present a unified framework for studying Coulomb interactions in arbitrary\nenvironments using macroscopic quantum electrodynamics on the basis of the\nelectromagnetic Green's function. Our theory can be used to derive the Coulomb\npotential of a single charged particle as well as that between two charges in\nthe presence of media, bodies and interfaces of arbitrary shapes. To\ndemonstrate this, we reproduce the well-known screened Coulomb force, account\nfor local-field effects and consider new cases such as a dielectric cavity and\na conducting plate with a hole.\n", "  Neuroimaging data can be represented as networks of nodes and edges that\ncapture the topological organization of the brain connectivity. Graph theory\nprovides a general and powerful framework to study these networks and their\nstructure at various scales. By way of example, community detection methods\nhave been widely applied to investigate the modular structure of many natural\nnetworks, including brain functional connectivity networks. Sparsification\nprocedures are often applied to remove the weakest edges, which are the most\naffected by experimental noise, and to reduce the density of the graph, thus\nmaking it theoretically and computationally more tractable. However, weak links\nmay also contain significant structural information, and procedures to identify\nthe optimal tradeoff are the subject of active research. Here, we explore the\nuse of percolation analysis, a method grounded in statistical physics, to\nidentify the optimal sparsification threshold for community detection in brain\nconnectivity networks. By using synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth\nmodular structure and realistic topological features typical of human brain\nfunctional connectivity networks, we show that percolation analysis can be\napplied to identify the optimal sparsification threshold that maximizes\ninformation on the networks' community structure. We validate this approach\nusing three different community detection methods widely applied to the\nanalysis of brain connectivity networks: Newman's modularity, InfoMap and\nAsymptotical Surprise. Importantly, we test the effects of noise and data\nvariability, which are critical factors to determine the optimal threshold.\nThis data-driven method should prove particularly useful in the analysis of the\ncommunity structure of brain networks in populations characterized by different\nconnectivity strengths, such as patients and controls.\n", "  Discontinuity of gauge theory in the gauge condition $n\\cdot\\partial n\\cdot\nA=0$, which emerges at $n\\cdot k=0$, is studied here. Such discontinuity is\ndifferent from that one confronts in axial gauge and can not be regularized by\nconventional analytical continuation method. The Faddeev-Popov determinate of\nthe gauge $n\\cdot\\partial n\\cdot A=0$, which is solved explicitly in the\nmanuscript, behaves like a $\\delta$-functional of gauge potentials once\nsingularities in the functional integral is neglected and the length along\n$n^{\\mu}$ direction of the space tends to infinity. As a sequence, perturbation\nseries in the gauge $n\\cdot\\partial n\\cdot A=0$ returns to that in axial gauge\nfor short-range correlated objects that are free from singularities in path\nintegral. However, the equivalence between the gauge $n\\cdot\\partial n\\cdot\nA=0$ and axil gauge is nontrivial for long-range correlated objects and\nquantities that are affected by singularities in path integral. Continuity of\ngauge links one encounter in perturbation theory and lattice calculation is\naffected by such discontinuity.\n", "  We predict a discriminatory interaction between a chiral molecule and an\nachiral molecule which is mediated by a chiral body. To achieve this, we\ngeneralize the van der Waals interaction potential between two ground-state\nmolecules with electric, magnetic and chiral response to non-trivial\nenvironments. The force is evaluated using second-order perturbation theory\nwith an effective Hamiltonian. Chiral media enhance or reduce the free\ninteraction via many-body interactions, making it possible to measure the\nchiral contributions to the van der Waals force with current technology. The\nvan der Waals interaction is discriminatory with respect to enantiomers of\ndifferent handedness and could be used to separate enantiomers. We also suggest\na specific geometric configuration where the electric contribution to the van\nder Waals interaction is zero, making the chiral component the dominant effect.\n", "  Incorporation of magnetism in graphene based compounds holds great promise\nfor potential spintronic applications. By optimizing point defects and high\nedge density of defects, we report many-fold increase in the ferromagnetic\nsaturation moment in lacey reduced graphene oxide nanoribbons (LRGONR) as\ncompared to other graphene derivatives. The samples were synthesized using\nchemical unzipping methodology. Detailed structural and morphological\ncharacterizations are discussed that include XRD, Raman, SEM, HRTEM and XPS\nmeasurements. Brilluoin function analysis to magnetization data reflects best\nfit for J = 7/2 with a saturation moment of 1.1 emu/g. The microscopic origin\nof magnetization in LRGONR is assigned to high edge defect density which has\nalso been correlated to microstructure.\n", "  The use of topological invariants to describe geometric phases of quantum\nmatter has become an essential tool in modern solid state physics. The first\ninstance of this paradigmatic trend can be traced to the study of the quantum\nHall effect, in which the Chern number underlies the quantization of the\ntransverse Hall conductivity. More recently, in the framework of time-reversal\nsymmetric topological insulators and quantum spin Hall systems, a new\ntopological classification has been proposed by Fu, Kane and Mele, where the\nlabel takes value in $\\mathbb Z_2$.\n  We illustrate how both the Chern number $c \\in \\mathbb Z$ and the\nFu-Kane-Mele invariant $\\delta \\in \\mathbb Z_2$ of 2-dimensional topological\ninsulators can be characterized as topological obstructions. Indeed, $c$\nquantifies the obstruction to the existence of a frame of Bloch states for the\ncrystal which is both continuous and periodic with respect to the crystal\nmomentum. Instead, $\\delta$ measures the possibility to impose a further\ntime-reversal symmetry constraint on the Bloch frame.\n", "  The expanding complex pattern of filaments, walls and voids build the\nevolving cosmic web with material flowing from underdense onto high density\nregions. Here we explore the dynamical behaviour of voids and galaxies in void\nshells relative to neighboring overdense superstructures, using the Millenium\nSimulation and the main galaxy catalogue in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. We\ndefine a correlation measure to estimate the tendency of voids to be located at\na given distance from a superstructure. We find voids-in-clouds (S-types)\npreferentially located closer to superstructures than voids-in-voids (R-types)\nalthough we obtain that voids within $\\sim40~\\mathrm{Mpc}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ of\nsuperstructures are infalling in a similar fashion independently of void type.\nGalaxies residing in void shells show infall towards the closest\nsuperstructure, along with the void global motion, with a differential velocity\ncomponent depending on their relative position in the shell with respect to the\ndirection to the superstructure. This effect is produced by void expansion and\ntherefore is stronger for R-types. We also find that galaxies in void shells\nfacing the superstrucure flow towards the overdensities faster than galaxies\nelsewere at the same relative distance to the superstructure.\n  The results obtained for the simulation are also reproduced for the SDSS data\nwith a linearized velocity field implementation.\n", "  We present a method to derive the density scaling relation $\\langle n\\rangle\n\\propto L^{-\\alpha}$ in regions of star formation or in their turbulent\nvicinities from straightforward binning of the column-density distribution\n($N$-pdf). The outcome of the method is studied for three types of $N$-pdf:\npower law ($7/5\\le\\alpha\\le5/3$), lognormal ($0.7\\lesssim\\alpha\\lesssim1.4$)\nand combination of lognormals. In the last case, the method of Stanchev et al.\n(2015) was also applied for comparison and a very weak (or close to zero)\ncorrelation was found. We conclude that the considered `binning approach'\nreflects rather the local morphology of the $N$-pdf with no reference to the\nphysical conditions in a considered region. The rough consistency of the\nderived slopes with the widely adopted Larson's (1981) value $\\alpha\\sim1.1$ is\nsuggested to support claims that the density-size relation in molecular clouds\nis indeed an artifact of the observed $N$-pdf.\n", "  Of late, a number of instances of neutrino flux anomalies observed at\nshort-baselines have given traction to the hypothesis of adding new neutrino\nflavours to our Standard Model set, albeit ones not associated with a partnered\nlepton. Anomalies observed at LSND, MiniBooNE and at short distances from\nnuclear reactors have suggested the existence of sterile mass states with\nmasses on the scale of $\\sim1\\text{eV}$, prompting further investigations.\nSubsequently, Fermilab is set to host a Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN)\noscillation program which will cross-check each of these anomalies by deploying\nthree state-of-the-art liquid argon detectors along the Booster Neutrino\nBeamline. Through an event-by-event Monte Carlo simulation study, this document\npresents short-baseline oscillation sensitivity predictions for SBN on a purely\nstatistical basis in the scope of a 3+1 sterile neutrino model approximated\nwith a two flavour mixing basis. As a world's first, sensitivities in parameter\nspace to 3+1 mixing angles $\\theta_{14}$ and $\\theta_{24}$ are presented, in\naddition to the sensitivities gained by combining $\\nu_\\mu$ disappearance and\n$\\nu_e$ appearance channel data. Provided also are energy spectra and 3+1\noscillation parameter sensitivity predictions for these two individual\nchannels. The results agreed with parameter space sensitivity predictions\nalready conceived by Fermilab to a satisfactory degree.\n", "  A connection, which shows the dependence of norming constants on boundary\nconditions, was found using the Gelfand-Levitan method for the solution of\ninverse Sturm-Liouville problem.\n", "  The unusually high surface tension of room temperature liquid metal is\nmolding it as unique material for diverse newly emerging areas. However, unlike\nits practices on earth, such metal fluid would display very different behaviors\nwhen working in space where gravity disappears and surface property dominates\nthe major physics. So far, few direct evidences are available to understand\nsuch effect which would impede further exploration of liquid metal use for\nspace. Here to preliminarily probe into this intriguing issue, a low cost\nexperimental strategy to simulate microgravity environment on earth was\nproposed through adopting bridges with high enough free falling distance as the\ntest platform. Then using digital cameras amounted along x, y, z directions on\noutside wall of the transparent container with liquid metal and allied solution\ninside, synchronous observations on the transient flow and transformational\nactivities of liquid metal were performed. Meanwhile, an unmanned aerial\nvehicle was adopted to record the whole free falling dynamics of the test\ncapsule from the far end which can help justify subsequent experimental\nprocedures. A series of typical fundamental phenomena were thus observed as:\n(a) A relatively large liquid metal object would spontaneously transform from\nits original planar pool state into a sphere and float in the container if\ninitiating the free falling; (b) The liquid metal changes its three-dimensional\nshape due to dynamic microgravity strength due to free falling and rebound of\nthe test capsule; and (c) A quick spatial transformation of liquid metal\nimmersed in the solution can easily be induced via external electrical fields.\nThe mechanisms of the surface tension driven liquid metal actuation in space\nwere interpreted. All these findings indicated that microgravity effect should\nbe fully treated in developing future generation liquid metal space\ntechnologies.\n", "  Astronomical observations reveal a gap in the mass spectrum of relativistic\nobjects: neither black holes nor neutron stars with 2 - 5 solar masses have\never been observed.\n  In this article I proceed in presenting the scenario which discloses a\npossible hidden connection between massive neutron stars (MANSs), dark matter\nand dark energy in cosmology. Accordingly, when the curved spacetime embedding\nMANSs compresses the nuclear matter to beyond a critical supranuclear density\n$n_{cr},$ mesons, generally transmitting the residual nuclear forces between\nneutrons, could gain energy by frequently interacting with a scalar field\n$\\phi$ at the background. When the effective energy of mesons becomes\ncomparable to the bag energy enclosing the quarks, the neutrons merge together\nand form a super-baryon (SB), whose interior is made of incompressible\ngluon-quark superfluid. It turns out that the process has a runaway-character:\nit enables the super-baryon to grow in mass and volume from inside-to-outside\nto finally metamorphose the entire object into a completely invisible dark\ngluon-quark object, practically indistinguishable from isolated stellar black\nholes. The inability of these objects to merge with other objects whilst\nagglomerating in clusters makes them excellent candidates both for black holes\nand for dark matter halos in cosmology.\n", "  Hyperspectral imaging is an ubiquitous technique in solar physics\nobservations and the recent advances in solar instrumentation enabled us to\nacquire and record data at an unprecedented rate. The huge amount of data which\nwill be archived in the upcoming solar observatories press us to compress the\ndata in order to reduce the storage space and transfer times. The correlation\npresent over all dimensions, spatial, temporal and spectral, of solar data-sets\nsuggests the use of a 3D base wavelet decomposition, to achieve higher\ncompression rates. In this work, we evaluate the performance of the recent\nJPEG2000 Part 10 standard, known as JP3D, for the lossless compression of\nseveral types of solar data-cubes. We explore the differences in: a) The\ncompressibility of broad-band or narrow-band time-sequence; I or V stokes\nprofiles in spectropolarimetric data-sets; b) Compressing data in\n[x,y,$\\lambda$] packages at different times or data in [x,y,t] packages of\ndifferent wavelength; c) Compressing a single large data-cube or several\nsmaller data-cubes; d) Compressing data which is under-sampled or super-sampled\nwith respect to the diffraction cut-off.\n", "  Understanding how nanostructure and nanomechanics influence physical material\nproperties on the micro- and macroscale is an essential goal in soft condensed\nmatter research. Mechanisms governing fragmentation and chirality inversion of\nfilamentous colloids are of specific interest because of their critical role in\nload-bearing and self-organizing functionalities of soft nanomaterials. Here we\nprovide a fundamental insight into the self-organization across several length\nscales of nanocellulose, an important bio-colloid system with wide-ranging\napplications as structural, insulating and functional material. Through a\ncombined microscopic and statistical analysis of nanocellulose fibrils at the\nsingle particle level, we show how mechanically and chemically induced\nfragmentation proceed in this system. Moreover, by studying the bottom-up\nself-assembly of fragmented carboxylated cellulose nanofibrils into cholesteric\nliquid crystals, we show via direct microscopic observations, that the\nchirality is inverted from right-handed at the nanofibril level to left-handed\nat the level of the liquid crystal phase. These results improve our fundamental\nunderstanding of nanocellulose and provide an important rationale for their\napplication in colloidal systems, liquid crystals and nanomaterials.\n", "  Studies of magnetization dynamics have incessantly facilitated the discovery\nof fundamentally novel physical phenomena, making steady headway in the\ndevelopment of magnetic and spintronics devices. The dynamics can be induced\nand detected electrically, offering new functionalities in advanced electronics\nat the nanoscale. However, its scattering mechanism is still disputed.\nUnderstanding the mechanism in thin films is especially important, because most\nspintronics devices are made from stacks of multilayers with nanometer\nthickness. The stacks are known to possess interfacial magnetic anisotropy, a\ncentral property for applications, whose influence on the dynamics remains\nunknown. Here, we investigate the impact of interfacial anisotropy by adopting\nCoFeB/MgO as a model system. Through systematic and complementary measurements\nof ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), on a series of thin films, we identify\nnarrower FMR linewidths at higher temperatures. We explicitly rule out the\ntemperature dependence of intrinsic damping as a possible cause, and it is also\nnot expected from existing extrinsic scattering mechanisms for ferromagnets. We\nascribe this observation to motional narrowing, an old concept so far neglected\nin the analyses of FMR spectra. The effect is confirmed to originate from\ninterfacial anisotropy, impacting the practical technology of spin-based\nnanodevices up to room temperature.\n", "  We introduce a weighed-loop algorithm that is applicable to any weighed graph\nnetwork. It is designed to prefer a route of energetically unfavourable bonds\nin the lattice that can then be flipped without changing the structure inside\nand outside the enclosed loop. Due to this property there are effectively no\nenergy barriers thus making this algorithm very suitable for finding low energy\nstates in very rough energy landscapes. We apply this algorithm to the random\nbond Ising model with domain walls and show that the weighed-loop algorithm can\noutperform Niedermayer's algorithm for low enough temperatures and high enough\ndisorder. We consolidate the high-temperature behaviour of the roughness of a\ndomain-wall with a low-temperature expansion presented in this paper and show\nagreement with results from our simulations. The effects of temperature,\ndisorder, and system size on the roughness of domain-walls is also\ninvestigated.\n", "  The mean axial velocity of lithium irons across the entrance of carbon\nnanotube VLi is an important factor for the charge-discharge performances of\nrechargeable Lithium battery. The molecular dynamics simulation method is\nadopted to evaluate the factors and their effects on VLi which include the\ndiameter of carbon nanotube, functional group type on the port and the number\nof a given type of functional group. The statistical analysis of the\ncalculation results shows that: In the selected carbon nanotubes of four\ndifferent diameters, VLi will gradually rise with the increase of CNT diameter\ndue to lithium irons migration resistance decreasing; as the port of CNT is\nsuccessively modified to hydrogen (-H), hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2) and\ncarboxyl (-COOH), the corresponding migration resistance of lithium ions is\nenhanced resulting in the dropping of VLi; in comparison to the effect strength\nof four types of functional groups on VLi, -COOH shows strongest, -NH2 and -OH\nperform relatively weaker, and the effect difference between -NH2 and -OH is\nvery small, -H displays weakest; When the number of a given non-hydrogen\nfunctional group on the port sequentially increases, it also shows a trend that\nlithium ion migration resistance gradually increases which makes VLi decreases\nin turn. The more influential the functional group, the greater the impact of\nfunctional group number changes on VLi. The results of this paper have some\nsignificance on the precise production of lithium-ion battery electrode\nmaterials, enhancing the overall battery cycle efficiency and charging speed.\n", "  In this letter, we study the charge response from higher derivatives over the\nbackground with homogeneous disorder introduced by axions. We first explore the\nbounds on the higher derivatives coupling from DC conductivity and the\nanomalies of causality and instabilities. Our results indicate no tighter\nconstraints on the coupling than that over Schwarzschild-AdS (SS-AdS)\nbackground. And then we study the optical conductivity of our holographic\nsystem. We find that for the case with $\\gamma_1<0$ and the disorder strength\n$\\hat{\\alpha}<2/\\sqrt{3}$, there is a crossover from a coherent to incoherent\nmetallic phase as $\\hat{\\alpha}$ increases. When $\\hat{\\alpha}$ is beyond\n$\\hat{\\alpha}=2/\\sqrt{3}$ and further amplified, a peak exhibits again at low\nfrequency. But it cannot be well fitted by the standard Drude formula and new\nformula for describing this behavior shall be called for. While for the\nholographic system with the limit of $\\gamma_1\\rightarrow 1/48$, the disorder\neffect drives the hard-gap-like at low frequency into the soft gap and\nsuppresses the pronounced peak at medium frequency.\n", "  Complex parameters in the MSSM lead to mixing and interference between the\ntwo heavier neutral CP-even and CP-odd Higgs states. These effects can become\nvery large in the case of almost degenerate states. In a CP-violating benchmark\nscenario, we investigate phenomenological implications of such interferences in\nview of the LHC searches for heavy Higgs bosons decaying to a pair of\n$\\tau$-leptons and produced in gluon fusion and in association with b-quarks.\nStrongly destructive effects leave parameter regions unconstrained that would\nbe regarded as excluded if no interference terms were taken into account.\n", "  Tokamak plasma current start-up assisted by Electron Bernstein waves (EBW)\nhas been demonstrated successfully in a number of experiments. The dynamic\nstart-up phase involves a change in field topology, as the initially open\nmagnetic field lines form closed flux surfaces (CFS) under the initiation of a\nplasma current. This change in field topology will bring about a change in the\ncurrent drive (CD) mechanism, and, although various mechanisms have been\nproposed to explain the formation of CFS, no detailed theoretical studies have\npreviously been undertaken. Here, we report on the development of a start-up\nmodel for EBW-assisted plasma current start-up in MAST. It is shown that\ncollisions are responsible for only a small part of the CD, while the open\nmagnetic field line configuration leads to an asymmetric confinement of\nelectrons, which is responsible for the greater part of the CD.\n", "  Counting formulae for general primary fields in free four dimensional\nconformal field theories of scalars, vectors and matrices are derived. These\nare specialised to count primaries which obey extremality conditions defined in\nterms of the dimensions and left or right spins (i.e. in terms of relations\nbetween the charges under the Cartan subgroup of $SO(4,2)$). The construction\nof primary fields for scalar field theory is mapped to a problem of determining\nmulti-variable polynomials subject to a system of symmetry and differential\nconstraints. For the extremal primaries, we give a construction in terms of\nholomorphic polynomial functions on permutation orbifolds, which are shown to\nbe Calabi-Yau spaces.\n", "  In this letter, we systematically explore the holographic (non-)relativistic\nfermionic spectrum without/with dipole coupling dual to Born-Infeld anti-de\nSitter (BI-AdS) black hole. For the relativistic fermionic fixed point, this\nholographic fermionic system exhibits non-Fermi liquid behavior. Also, with the\nincrease of BI parameter $\\gamma$, the non-Fermi liquid becomes even \"more\nnon-Fermi\". When the dipole coupling term is included, we find that the BI term\nmakes it a lot tougher to form the gap. While for the non-relativistic\nfermionic system with large dipole coupling in BI-AdS background, with the\nincrease of BI parameter, the gap comes into being against.\n", "  Recent studies indicate that measurements of fractal and multifractal\nparameters of active regions (ARs) are not efficient tools to discriminate ARs\non the basis of the flare activity, as well as to predict flare events.\nAttempting validation of this result on a large data set of higher spatial and\ntemporal resolution, as well as higher flux sensitivity, observations than\nemployed in previous studies, we analyzed high-cadence time series of\nline-of-sight magnetograms of 43 ARs characterized by different flare activity,\nwhich were observed with SDO/HMI from May 2010 to December 2013. On these data,\nwe estimated four parameters, the generalized fractal dimensions $D_0$ and\n$D_8$, and the multifractal parameters $C_{\\mathrm{div}}$ and\n$D_{\\mathrm{div}}$. We found distinct average values of the parameters measured\non ARs that have hosted flares of different class. However, the dispersion of\nvalues measured on ARs that have produced same class events is such that the\nparameters deduced from distinct classes of flaring regions can also largely\noverlap. Based on the results of our measurements, C- and M-class flaring ARs\nare practically indistinguishable, as well as M- and X-class flaring ARs. We\nfound consistent changes on the time series of the measured parameters only on\n$\\approx$ 50\\% of the studied ARs and $\\approx$ 50\\% of the M- and X-class\nevents considered. We show that these results hold for fractal and multifractal\nparameter estimates based on both total unsigned and signed flux data of the\nanalyzed ARs.\n", "  The dynamics of two-component solitons is studied, analytically and\nnumerically, in the framework of a system of coupled extended nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equations, which incorporate the cross-phase modulation,\npseudo-stimulated-Raman-scattering (pseudo-SRS), cross-pseudo-SRS, and\nspatially inhomogeneous second-order dispersion (SOD). The system models\nco-propagation of electromagnetic waves with orthogonal polarizations in\nplasmas. It is shown that the soliton's wavenumber downshift, caused by\npseudo-SRS, may be compensated by an upshift, induced by the inhomogeneous SOD,\nto produce stable stationary two-component solitons. The corresponding\napproximate analytical solutions for stable solitons are found. Analytical\nresults are well confirmed by their numerical counterparts. Further, the\nevolution of inputs composed of spatially even and odd components is\ninvestigated by means of systematic simulations, which reveal three different\noutcomes: formation of a breather which keeps opposite parities of the\ncomponents; splitting into a pair of separating vector solitons; and spreading\nof the weak odd component into a small-amplitude pedestal with an embedded dark\nsoliton.\n"]}
