Our choice of these algebras is motivated by the\nfact that they belong to a narrow class of algebras, which we call 'conformal\nLie algebras', which have very similar properties to the conformal algebras of\nMinkowski space-time. We give the main multiplets and the main reduced\nmultiplets of indecomposable elementary representations for n=6, including the\nnecessary data for all relevant invariant differential operators. In fact, this\ngives by reduction also the cases for n<6, since the main multiplet for fixed n\ncoincides with one reduced case for n+1.\n", "  The present day universe consists of galaxies, galaxy clusters,\none-dimensional filaments and two-dimensional sheets or pancakes, all of which\ncombine to form the cosmic web. The so called \"Zeldovich pancakes\", are very\ndifficult to observe, because their overdensity is only slightly greater than\nthe average density of the universe.\n  Falco et al (2014) presented a method to identify Zeldovich pancakes in\nobservational data, and these were used as a tool for estimating the mass of\ngalaxy clusters. Here we expand and refine that observational detection method.\nWe study two pancakes on scales of 10 Mpc, identified from spectroscopically\nobserved galaxies near the Coma cluster, and compare with twenty numerical\npancakes.\n  We find that the observed structures have velocity dispersion about 100\nkm/sec, which is relatively low compared to typical groups and filaments. These\nvelocity dispersions are consistent with those found for the numerical\npancakes. We also confirm that the identified structures are in fact\ntwo-dimensional structures. Finally, we estimate the stellar to total mass of\nthe observational pancakes to be $2 \\times 10^{-4}$, within one order of\nmagnitude, which is smaller than that of clusters of galaxies.\n", "  Equilibrium solutions are believed to structure the pathways for ergodic\ntrajectories in a dynamical system. However, equilibria are atypical for\nsystems with continuous symmetries, i.e. for systems with homogeneous spatial\ndimensions, whereas relative equilibria (traveling waves) are generic. In order\nto visualize the unstable manifolds of such solutions, a practical symmetry\nreduction method is required that converts relative equilibria into equilibria,\nand relative periodic orbits into periodic orbits. In this article we extend\nthe fixed Fourier mode slice approach, previously applied 1-dimensional PDEs,\nto a spatially 3-dimensional fluid flow, and show that is substantially more\neffective than our previous approach to slicing. Application of this method to\na minimal flow unit pipe leads to the discovery of many relative periodic\norbits that appear to fill out the turbulent regions of state space. We further\ndemonstrate the value of this approach to symmetry reduction through\nprojections (projections only possible in the symmetry-reduced space) that\nreveal the interrelations between these relative periodic orbits and the ways\nin which they shape the geometry of the turbulent attractor.\n", "  In metrological tasks, employing entanglement can quantitatively improve the\nprecision of parameter estimation. However, susceptibility of the entanglement\nto decoherence fades this capability in the realistic metrology and limits\nultimate quantum improvement. One of the most destructive decoherence-type\nnoise is uncorrelated Markovian noise which commutes with the\nparameter-encoding Hamiltonian and is modelled as a semigroup dynamics, for\nwhich the quantum improvement is constrained to a constant factor. It has been\nshown [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{109}, 233601 (2012)] that when the noisy time\nevolution is governed by a local and non-semigroup dynamics (e.g., induced by\nan uncorrelated non-Markovian dephasing), emerging the Zeno regime at short\ntimes can result in the Zeno scaling in the precision. Here, by considering the\nimpact of the correlated noise in metrology, we show that spatially correlated\nenvironments which lead to a nonlocal and non-semigroup dynamics can improve\nthe precision of a noisy frequency measurement beyond the Zeno scaling. In\nparticular, it is demonstrated that one can find decoherence-free subspaces and\nsubsequently achieve the Heisenberg precision scaling for an approximated\ndynamics induced by spatially correlated environments.\n", "  We review some theories of non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates in\npotentials, in particular of the Bose-Einstein condensate of polaritons. We\ndiscuss such condensates, which are steady-states established through a balance\nof gain and loss, in the complementary limits of a double-well potential and a\nrandom disorder potential. For equilibrium condensates, the former corresponds\nto a Josephson junction, whereas the latter is the setting for the\nsuperfluid/Bose glass transition. We explore the non-equilibrium generalization\nof these phenomena, and highlight connections with mode selection and\nsynchronization.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the modified Geodesic Deviation Equation (GDE)\nin the framework of $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity where $R$ and $T$ are the\ncurvature scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively,\nusing the FLRW background. In this way, we obtain the GR equivalent (GDE) in\n$f(R,T)$ metric formalism. We also extend our work to the generalization of the\nMatting relation and perform the numerical analysis with GDE for null vector.\n", "  For a qualitative analysis of spectra of certain two-dimensional\nrectangular-well quantum systems several rigorous methods of number theory are\nshown productive and useful. These methods (and, in particular, a\ngeneralization of the concept of Markov constant known in Diophantine\napproximation theory) are shown to provide a new mathematical insight in the\nphenomenologically relevant occurrence of anomalies in the spectra. Our results\nmay inspire methodical innovations ranging from the description of the\nstability properties of metamaterials and of certain hiddenly unitary quantum\nevolution models up to the clarification of the mechanisms of occurrence of\nghosts in quantum cosmology.\n", "  We give an overview of recent developments in the theory of dimer models. The\nviewpoint we take is inspired by mirror symmetry. After an introduction to the\ncombinatorics of dimer models, we will first look at dimers in dynamical\nsystems and statistical mechanics, which can be viewed as coming from the\nA-model in mirror symmetry. Then we will discuss the role of dimers in the\ntheory of resolutions of singularities, which is inspired by the B-model. The C\nstands for the connections that tie both subjects together: clusters,\ncategories, and stability conditions. In this final part we will give some\nideas on how these two stories fit in a broader framework.\n", "  We review our theoretical knowledge of possible toroidal high-spin isomers in\nthe light mass region in 28$\\le$$A$$\\le$52 obtained previously in cranked\nSkyrme-Hartree-Fock calculations. We report additional toroidal high-spin\nisomers in $^{56}$Ni with $I$=114$\\hbar$ and 140$\\hbar$, which follow the same\n(multi-particle)--(multi-hole) systematics as other toroidal high-spin isomers.\nWe examine the production of these exotic nuclei by fusion of various\nprojectiles on $^{20}$Ne or $^{28}$Si as an active target in\ntime-projection-chamber (TCP) experiments.\n", "  Propagation of relativistically intense azimuthally or radially polarized\nlaser pulses (RPP) in underdense plasmas is demonstrated to be unstable, via 3D\nparticle-in-cell simulation and disregarding the Kerr non-linearity. Strong\npulse filamentation occurs for RPP in transversely uniform plasma with an\nincrement, $\\Gamma$, close to the well-known one depending on acceleration,\n$\\alpha$, and modulated density gradient length, $L$, as $\\Gamma \\approx\n(\\alpha/L)^{1/2}$. In deep plasma channels the instability vanishes. Electron\nself-injection and acceleration by the resulting laser pulse wake is explored.\n", "  This paper considers the propagation of TE-modes in photonic crystal\nwaveguides. The waveguide is created by introducing a linear defect into a\nperiodic background medium. Both the periodic background problem and the\nperturbed problem are modelled by a divergence type equation. A feature of our\nanalysis is that we allow discontinuities in the coefficients of the operator,\nwhich is required to model many photonic crystals. It is shown that arbitrarily\nweak perturbations introduce spectrum into the spectral gaps of the background\noperator.\n", "  The past decade has seen atomic Bose-Einstein condensates emerge as a\npromising prototype system to explore the quantum mechanical form of\nturbulence, buoyed by a powerful experimental toolbox to control and manipulate\nthe fluid, and the amenity to describe the system from first-principles. This\narticle presents an overview of quantum turbulence in atomic condensates, from\nits history and fundamental motivations, its characteristics and key results to\ndate, and finally to some promising future directions.\n", "  We review recent results on the coherence and superfluidity of driven\ndissipative condensates, i.e., systems of weakly-interacting non-conserved\nBosons, such as polariton condensates. The presence of driving and dissipation\nhas dramatically different effects depending on dimensionality and anisotropy.\nIn three dimensions, equilibrium behaviour is recovered at large scales for\nstatic correlations, while the dynamical behaviour is altered by the\nmicroscopic driving. In two dimensions, for an isotropic system, drive and\ndissipation destroy the algebraic order that would otherwise exist, however a\nsufficiently anisotropic system can still show algebraic phase correlations. We\ndiscuss the consequences of this behaviour for recent experiments measuring\nphase coherence, and outline potential measurements that might directly probe\nsuperfluidity.\n", "  In order to provide a guaranteed precision and a more accurate judgement\nabout the true value of the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound and its scaling behavior, an\nupper bound (equivalently a lower bound on the quantum Fisher information) for\nprecision of estimation is introduced. Unlike the bounds previously introduced\nin the literature, the upper bound is saturable and yields a practical\ninstruction to estimate the parameter through preparing the optimal initial\nstate and optimal measurement. The bound is based on the underling dynamics and\nits calculation is straightforward and requires only the matrix representation\nof the quantum maps responsible for encoding the parameter. This allows us to\napply the bound to open quantum systems whose dynamics are described by either\nsemigroup or non-semigroup maps. Reliability and efficiency of the method to\npredict the ultimate precision limit are demonstrated by {three} main examples.\n", "  A new scheme for enantiomer differentiation of chiral molecules using a pair\nof linearly polarized intense ultrashort laser pulses with skewed mutual\npolarization is presented. The technique relies on the fact that the\noff-diagonal anisotropic contributions to the electric polarizability tensor\nfor two enantiomers have different signs. Exploiting this property, we are able\nto excite a coherent unidirectional rotation of two enantiomers with a {\\pi}\nphase difference in the molecular electric dipole moment. The approach is\nrobust and suitable for relatively high temperatures of molecular samples,\nmaking it applicable for selective chiral analysis of mixtures, and to chiral\nmolecules with low barriers between enantiomers. As an illustration, we present\nnanosecond laser-driven dynamics of a tetratomic non-rigid chiral molecule with\nshort-lived chirality. The ultrafast time scale of the proposed technique is\nwell suited to study parity violation in molecular systems in short-lived\nchiral states.\n", "  Some strategies for reducing energy consumption in information processing\ndevices involve the use of spin rather than charge to carry information. This\nidea is especially attractive when the spin current is a collective one carried\nby the condensate of a magnetically ordered state, rather than a quasiparticle\ncurrent carried by electrons or magnons. In this Chapter we explain how\neasy-plane magnets can be viewed as Bose-Einstein condensates of magnons,\ndefined in terms of quanta of the spin-component perpendicular to the easy\nplane, and how they can carry dissipationless spin-currents that induce\nnon-local interactions between electrically isolated conducting channels. We\ncomment specifically on important differences between superconductivity in\nnormal/superconducting/normal circuits and spin-superfluidity in\nnormal/magnetic/normal circuits.\n", "  We extend the existing theoretical model for determining the characteristic\nfeatures of magnetic deflagration in nanomagnet crystals. For the first time,\nall energy levels are accounted for calculation of the the Zeeman energy, the\ndeflagration velocity, and other parameters. It reduces the final temperature\nand significantly changes the propagation velocity of the spin-flipping front.\nWe also consider the effect of a strong transverse magnetic field, and show\nthat the latter significantly modifies the spin-state structure, leading to an\nuncertainty concerning the activation energy of the spin flipping. Our front\nvelocity prediction for a crystal of Mn$_{12}$-acetate in a longitudinal\nmagnetic field is in much better agreement with experimental data than the\nprevious reduced-model results.\n", "  A measurement of the differential branching fraction of the decay\n${B^{0}\\rightarrow K^{\\ast}(892)^{0}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}}$ is presented together with\na determination of the S-wave fraction of the $K^+\\pi^-$ system in the decay\n$B^{0}\\rightarrow K^{+}\\pi^{-}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$. The analysis is based on\n$pp$-collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3\\,fb$^{-1}$\ncollected with the LHCb experiment. The measurements are made in bins of the\ninvariant mass squared of the dimuon system, $q^2$. Precise theoretical\npredictions for the differential branching fraction of $B^{0}\\rightarrow\nK^{\\ast}(892)^{0}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decays are available for the $q^2$ region\n$1.1<q^2<6.0\\,{\\rm GeV}^2/c^4$. In this $q^2$ region, for the $K^+\\pi^-$\ninvariant mass range $796 < m_{K\\pi} < 996\\,{\\rm MeV}/c^2$, the S-wave fraction\nof the $K^+\\pi^-$ system in $B^{0}\\rightarrow K^{+}\\pi^{-}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$\ndecays is found to be \\begin{equation*}\n  F_{\\rm S} = 0.101\\pm0.017({\\rm stat})\\pm0.009 ({\\rm syst}), \\end{equation*}\nand the differential branching fraction of $B^{0}\\rightarrow\nK^{\\ast}(892)^{0}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decays is determined to be \\begin{equation*}\n  {\\rm d}\\mathcal{B}/{\\rm d} q^2 = (0.342_{\\,-0.017}^{\\,+0.017}({\\rm\nstat})\\pm{0.009}({\\rm syst})\\pm0.023({\\rm norm}))\\times 10^{-7}c^{4}/{\\rm\nGeV}^{2}. \\end{equation*} The differential branching fraction measurements\npresented are the most precise to date and are found to be in agreement with\nStandard Model predictions.\n", "  We explore the path integration -- upon the contour of hermitian\n(non-auxliary) field configurations -- of topologically twisted $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nChern-Simons-matter theory (TTCSM) on $\\mathbb{S}_2$ times a segment. In this\nway, we obtain the formula for the 3D topologically twisted index, first as a\nconvolution of TTCSM on $\\mathbb{S}_2$ times halves of $\\mathbb{S}_1$, second\nas TTCSM on $\\mathbb{S}_2$ times $\\mathbb{S}_1$ -- with a puncture --, and\nthird as TTCSM on $\\mathbb{S}_2 \\times \\mathbb{S}_1$. In contradistinction to\nthe first two cases, in the third case, the vector multiplet auxiliary field\n$D$ is constrained to be anti-hermitian.\n", "  We compute the isotropic gravitational wave (GW) background produced by\nbinary supermassive black holes (SBHs) in galactic nuclei. In our model,\nmassive binaries evolve at early times via gravitational-slingshot interaction\nwith nearby stars, and at later times by the emission of GWs. Our expressions\nfor the rate of binary hardening in the \"stellar\" regime are taken from the\nrecent work of Vasiliev et al., who show that in the non-axisymmetric galaxies\nexpected to form via mergers, stars are supplied to the center at high enough\nrates to ensure binary coalescence on Gyr timescales. We also include, for the\nfirst time, the extra degrees of freedom associated with evolution of the\nbinary's orbital plane; in rotating nuclei, interaction with stars causes the\norientation and the eccentricity of a massive binary to change in tandem,\nleading in some cases to very high eccentricities (e>0.9) before the binary\nenters the GW-dominated regime. We argue that previous studies have\nover-estimated the mean ratio of SBH mass to galaxy bulge mass by factors of 2\n- 3. In the frequency regime currently accessible to pulsar timing arrays\n(PTAs), our assumptions imply a factor 2 - 3 reduction in the characteristic\nstrain compared with the values computed in most recent studies, removing the\ntension that currently exists between model predictions and the non-detection\nof GWs.\n", "  We present a light-traces-mass (LTM) strong-lensing model of the massive\nlensing cluster MACS J2135.2-0102 ($z$=0.33; hereafter MACS2135), known in part\nfor hosting the Cosmic Eye galaxy lens. MACS2135 is also known to multiply-lens\na $z=$2.3 sub-mm galaxy near the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG), as well as a\nprominent, triply-imaged system at a large radius of $\\sim$37\" south of the\nBCG. We use the latest available Hubble imaging to construct an accurate\nlensing model for this cluster, identifying six new multiply-imaged systems\nwith the guidance of our LTM method, so that we have roughly quadrupled the\nnumber of lensing constraints. We determine that MACS2135 is amongst the top\nlensing clusters known, comparable in size to the Hubble Frontier Fields. For a\nsource at $z_{s}=2.32$, we find an effective Einstein radius of\n$\\theta_{e}=27\\pm3$\", enclosing $1.12 \\pm0.16 \\times10^{14}$ $M_{\\odot}$. We\nmake our lens model, including mass and magnification maps, publicly available,\nin anticipation of searches for high-$z$ galaxies with the James Webb Space\nTelescope for which this cluster is a compelling target.\n", "  Methods for ranking the importance of nodes in a network have a rich history\nin machine learning and across domains that analyze structured data. Recent\nwork has evaluated these methods though the seed set expansion problem: given a\nsubset $S$ of nodes from a community of interest in an underlying graph, can we\nreliably identify the rest of the community? We start from the observation that\nthe most widely used techniques for this problem, personalized PageRank and\nheat kernel methods, operate in the space of landing probabilities of a random\nwalk rooted at the seed set, ranking nodes according to weighted sums of\nlanding probabilities of different length walks. Both schemes, however, lack an\na priori relationship to the seed set objective. In this work we develop a\nprincipled framework for evaluating ranking methods by studying seed set\nexpansion applied to the stochastic block model. We derive the optimal gradient\nfor separating the landing probabilities of two classes in a stochastic block\nmodel, and find, surprisingly, that under reasonable assumptions the gradient\nis asymptotically equivalent to personalized PageRank for a specific choice of\nthe PageRank parameter $\\alpha$ that depends on the block model parameters.\nThis connection provides a novel formal motivation for the success of\npersonalized PageRank in seed set expansion and node ranking generally. We use\nthis connection to propose more advanced techniques incorporating higher\nmoments of landing probabilities; our advanced methods exhibit greatly improved\nperformance despite being simple linear classification rules, and are even\ncompetitive with belief propagation.\n", "  A large variety of interacting complex systems are characterized by\ninteractions occurring between more than two nodes. These systems are described\nby simplicial complexes. Simplicial complexes are formed by simplices (nodes,\nlinks, triangles, tetrahedra etc.) that have a natural geometric\ninterpretation. As such simplicial complexes are widely used in quantum gravity\napproaches that involve a discretization of spacetime. Here, by extending our\nknowledge of growing complex networks to growing simplicial complexes we\ninvestigate the nature of the emergent geometry of complex networks and explore\nwhether this geometry is hyperbolic. Specifically we show that an hyperbolic\nnetwork geometry emerges spontaneously from models of growing simplicial\ncomplexes that are purely combinatorial. The statistical and geometrical\nproperties of the growing simplicial complexes strongly depend on their\ndimensionality and display the major universal properties of real complex\nnetworks (scale-free degree distribution, small-world and communities) at the\nsame time. Interestingly, when the network dynamics includes an heterogeneous\nfitness of the faces, the growing simplicial complex can undergo phase\ntransitions that are reflected by relevant changes in the network geometry.\n", "  We present a new solution to the electroweak hierarchy problem. We introduce\n$N$ copies of the Standard Model with varying values of the Higgs mass\nparameter. This generically yields a sector whose weak scale is parametrically\nremoved from the cutoff by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{N}$. Ensuring that reheating\ndeposits a majority of the total energy density into this lightest sector\nrequires a modification of the standard cosmological history, providing a\npowerful probe of the mechanism. Current and near-future experiments will\nexplore much of the natural parameter space. Furthermore, supersymmetric\ncompletions which preserve grand unification predict superpartners with mass\nbelow $m_W \\times M_{\\text{pl}} / M_{\\text{GUT}} \\sim 10$ TeV.\n", "  Determining the nature of electronic states in doped Mott insulators remains\na challenging task. In the case of tetragonal La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$NiO$_{4}$, the\noccurrence of diagonal charge and spin stripe order in the ground state is now\nwell established. In contrast, the nature of the high-temperature \"disordered\"\nstate from which the stripe order develops has long been a subject of\ncontroversy, with considerable speculation regarding a polaronic liquid.\nFollowing on the recent detection of dynamic charge stripes, we use neutron\nscattering measurements on an $x=0.25$ crystal to demonstrate that the\ndispersion of the charge stripe excitations is anisotropic. This observation\nprovides compelling evidence for the presence of electronic nematic order.\n", "  Using thermodynamic relations and dimensional analysis we derive a general\nformula for the thermodynamical trace $2\\mathcal{E}-DP$ for non-relativistic\nsystems and $\\mathcal{E-DP}$ for relativistic systems, where $D$ is the number\nof spatial dimensions, in terms of the microscopic scales of the system within\nthe grand canonical ensemble. We demonstrate the formula for several cases,\nincluding anomalous systems which develop scales through dimensional\ntransmutation. Using this relation, we make explicit the connection between\ndimensional analysis and the virial theorem. This paper is focused mainly on\nthe non-relativistic aspects of this relation.\n", "  We introduce a quite large class of functions (including the exponential\nfunction and the power functions with exponent greater than one), and show that\nfor any element $f$ of this function class, a self-adjoint element $a$ of a\n$C^*$-algebra is central if and only if $a \\leq b$ implies $f(a) \\leq f(b).$\nThat is, we characterize centrality by local monotonicity of certain functions\non $C^*$-algebras. Numerous former results (including works of Ogasawara,\nPedersen, Wu, and Moln\\'ar) are apparent consequences of our result.\n", "  We present a strong-lensing (SL) analysis of the galaxy cluster MACS\nJ1319.9+7003 ($z=0.33$, also known as Abell 1722), as part of our ongoing\neffort to analyze massive clusters with archival {\\it HST} imaging. We\nspectroscopically measured with Keck/MOSFIRE two galaxies multiply-imaged by\nthe cluster. Our analysis reveals a modest lens, with an effective Einstein\nradius of $\\theta_{e}(z=2)=12\\pm1$\", enclosing $2.1\\pm0.3\\times10^{13}$\n$M_{\\odot}$. We briefly discuss the SL properties of the cluster, using two\ndifferent modeling techniques, and make the mass models\npublicly-available\\footnote{ftp://wise-ftp.tau.ac.il/pub/adiz/MACS1319/}.\nIndependently, we identified a noteworthy, young Shell Galaxy (SG) system\nforming around two likely interacting cluster members, 20\" north of the BCG.\nSGs are rare in galaxy clusters, and indeed, a simple estimate yields that they\nare only expected in roughly one in several dozen, to several hundred, massive\ngalaxy clusters (the estimate can easily change by an order-of-magnitude within\na reasonable range of characteristic values relevant for the calculation).\nTaking advantage of our lens model best-fit, mass-to-light scaling relation for\ncluster members, we infer that the total mass of the SG system is\n$\\sim1.3\\times10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$, with a host-to-companion mass ratio of\nabout 10:1. Despite being rare in high density environments, the SG constitutes\nan example to how stars of cluster galaxies are being efficiently redistributed\nto the Intra Cluster Medium. Dedicated numerical simulations for the observed\nshell configuration, perhaps aided by the mass model, might cast interesting\ninsight on the interaction history and properties of the two galaxies. An\narchival HST search in galaxy cluster images can reveal more such systems.\n", "  The axial-vector form factor of the nucleons is considered in the framework\nof hard-wall model of holographic QCD. A new interaction term between the bulk\ngauge and matter fields was included into the interaction Lagrangian. We obtain\nthe axial-vector form factor of nucleons in the boundary QCD from the bulk\naction using AdS/CFT correspondence. The momentum square dependence of the\naxial-vector form factor is analysed numerically.\n", "  We study the shear jamming of athermal frictionless soft spheres, and find\nthat in the thermodynamic limit, a shear-jammed state exists with different\nelastic properties from the isotropically-jammed state. For example,\nshear-jammed states can have a non-zero residual shear stress in the\nthermodynamic limit that arises from long-range stress-stress correlations. As\na result, the ratio of the shear and bulk moduli, which in isotropically-jammed\nsystems vanishes as the jamming transition is approached from above, instead\napproaches a constant. Despite these striking differences, we argue that in a\ndeeper sense, the shear jamming and isotropic jamming transitions actually have\nthe same symmetry, and that the differences can be fully understood by rotating\nthe six-dimensional basis of the elastic modulus tensor.\n", "  A quantum computer based on Majorana qubits would contain a large number of\nzero-energy Majorana states. This system can be modelled as a connected network\nof the Ising-Kitaev chains alternating the \"trivial\" and \"topological\" regions,\nwith the zero-energy Majorana fermions localized at their interfaces. The\nlow-energy sector of the theory describing such a network can be formulated in\nterms of leading-order couplings between the Majorana zero modes. I consider a\nminimal model exhibiting effective couplings between four Majorana zero modes -\nthe nonuniform Ising-Kitaev chain, containing two \"topological\" regions\nseparated by a \"trivial\" region. Solving the model exactly, I show that for\ngeneric values of the model parameters the four zero modes are localized at the\nfour interface points of the chain. In the special case where additional\ninversion symmetry is present, the Majorana zero modes are \"delocalized\"\nbetween two interface points. In both cases, the low-energy sector of the\ntheory can be formulated in terms of the localized Majorana fermions, but the\ncouplings between some of them are independent of their respective separations:\nthe exact solution does not support the \"nearest-neighbor\" form of the\neffective low-energy Hamiltonian.\n", "  In this paper we prove the existence of coupled K\\\"ahler-Einstein metrics on\ncomplex manifolds whose canonical bundle is ample. These metrics were\nintroduced and their existence in the said case was proven by Hultgren and\nNystr\\\"om using calculus of variations. We prove the result using the method of\ncontinuity. In the process of proving estimates, akin to the usual\nK\\\"ahler-Einstein metrics, we reduce existence in the Fano case to a C^0\nestimate.\n", "  In this paper we present quantum key distribution protocol that, instead of\nsingle qubits, uses mesoscopic coherent states of light $|\\alpha\\rangle$ to\nencode bit values of a randomly generated key. Given the reference value\n$\\alpha\\in\\mathbb C$, and a string of phase rotations each randomly taken from\na set of $2M$ equidistant phases, Alice prepares a quantum state given by a\nproduct of coherent states of light, such that a complex phase of each pulse is\nrotated by the corresponding phase rotation. The encoding of $i$-th bit of the\nkey $r=r_1 \\dots r_\\ell$ is done by further performing phase rotation $r_i \\pi$\n(with $r_i = 0,1$) on the $i$-th coherent state pulse. In order to protect the\nprotocol against the man-in-the-middle attack, we introduce a verification\nprocedure, and analyse the protocol's security using the Holevo bound. We also\nanalyse the possibility of beam splitting-like and of collective attacks,\nshowing the impossibility of the former and, in the case of our protocol, the\ninadequacy of the latter. While we cannot prove full perfect security against\nthe most general attacks allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics, our protocol\nachieves faster quantum key distribution, over larger distances and with lower\ncosts, than the single-photon counterparts, maintaining at least practical\nsecurity against the current and the near future technologies.\n", "  Topology optimization of permanent magnet systems consisting of permanent\nmagnets, high permeability iron and air is presented. An implementation of\ntopology optimization for magnetostatics is discussed and three examples are\nconsidered. First, the Halbach cylinder is topology optimized with iron and an\nincrease of 15% in magnetic efficiency is shown, albeit with an increase of 3.8\npp. in field inhomogeneity - a value compared to the inhomogeneity in a 16\nsegmented Halbach cylinder. Following this a topology optimized structure to\nconcentrate a homogeneous field is shown to increase the magnitude of the field\nby 111% for the chosen dimensions. Finally, a permanent magnet with alternating\nhigh and low field regions is considered. Here a $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{cool}$ figure\nof merit of 0.472 is reached, which is an increase of 100% compared to a\nprevious optimized design.\n", "  Since the discovery of the first charmed meson in 1976, many open-charm and\nopen-bottom hadrons were observed. In 2003 two narrow charm-strange states\n$D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ were discovered by the BaBar and CLEO\nCollaborations, respectively. After that, more excited heavy hadrons were\nreported. In this work, we review the experimental and theoretical progress in\nthis field.\n", "  Coulomb interactions that occur in electronic structure calculations are\ncorrelated by allowing basis function components of the interacting densities\nto polarize, thereby reducing the magnitude of the interaction. Exchange\nintegrals of molecular orbitals are not correlated. The modified Coulomb\ninteractions are used in single-determinant or configuration interaction\ncalculations. The objective is to account for dynamical correlation effects\nwithout explicitly introducing higher spherical harmonic functions into the\nmolecular orbital basis. Molecular orbital densities are decomposed into a\ndistribution of spherical components that conserve the charge and each of the\ninteracting components is considered as a two-electron wavefunction embedded in\nthe system acted on by an average field Hamiltonian plus . A method of avoiding\nredundancy is described. Applications to atoms, negative ions and molecules\nrepresenting different types of bonding and spin states are discussed.\n", "  We explicitly prove that the Weyl conformal symmetry solves the black hole\nsingularity problem, otherwise unavoidable in a generally covariant local or\nnon-local gravitational theory. Moreover, we yield explicit examples of local\nand non-local theories enjoying Weyl and diffeomorphism symmetry (in short\nco-covariant theories). Following the seminal paper by Narlikar and Kembhavi,\nwe provide an explicit construction of singularity-free spherically symmetric\nand axi-symmetric exact solutions for black hole spacetimes conformally\nequivalent to the Schwarzschild or the Kerr spacetime. We first check the\nabsence of divergences in the Kretschmann invariant for the rescaled metrics.\nAfterwords, we show that the new types of black holes are geodesically complete\nand linked by a Newman-Janis transformation just as in standard general\nrelativity (based on Einstein-Hilbert action). Furthermore, we argue that no\nmassive or massless particles can reach the former Schwarzschild singularity or\ntouch the former Kerr ring singularity in a finite amount of their proper time\nor of their affine parameter. Finally, we discuss the Raychaudhuri equation in\na co-covariant theory and we show that the expansion parameter for congruences\nof both types of geodesics (for massless and massive particles) never reaches\nminus infinity. Actually, the null geodesics become parallel at the $r=0$ point\nin the Schwarzschild spacetime (the origin) and the focusing of geodesics is\navoided. The arguments of regularity of curvature invariants, geodesic\ncompleteness, and finiteness of geodesics' expansion parameter ensure us that\nwe are dealing with singularity-free and geodesically-complete black hole\nspacetimes.\n", "  Cosmic baryon evolution during the Cosmic Dawn and Reionization results in\nredshifted 21-cm spectral distortions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).\nThese encode information about the nature and timing of first sources over\nredshifts 30-6 and appear at meter wavelengths as a tiny CMB distortion along\nwith the Galactic and extragalactic radio sky, which is orders of magnitude\nbrighter. Therefore, detection requires precise methods to model foregrounds.\nWe present a method of foreground fitting using maximally smooth (MS)\nfunctions. We demonstrate the usefulness of MS functions over traditionally\nused polynomials to separate foregrounds from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR)\nsignal. We also examine the level of spectral complexity in plausible\nforegrounds using GMOSS, a physically motivated model of the radio sky, and\nfind that they are indeed smooth and can be modeled by MS functions to levels\nsufficient to discern the vanilla model of the EoR signal. We show that MS\nfunctions are loss resistant and robustly preserve EoR signal strength and\nturning points in the residuals. Finally, we demonstrate that in using a\nwell-calibrated spectral radiometer and modeling foregrounds with MS functions,\nthe global EoR signal can be detected with a Bayesian approach with 90\\%\nconfidence in 10 minutes' integration.\n", "  The covariant propagator of a fermion with intrinsic magnetic moment\ninteracting with a uniform external magnetic field is presented for finite\ntemperature and baryonic density. The case of a scalar boson is also\nconsidered. The final expressions are given in terms of a four-dimensional\nmomentum representation. These results, which take account of the full effect\nof the magnetic field, are used to evaluate the modification of the pion mass\nat zero temperature as a function of the density and the magnetic intensity.\nFor this purpose a self-consistent calculation, including one- and two-pion\nvertices, is employed.\n", "  The latest experimental results from the LHC and dark matter (DM) searches\nsuggest that the parameter space allowed in supersymmetric theories is subject\nto strong reductions. These bounds are especially constraining for scenarios\nentailing light DM particles. Previous studies have shown that light neutralino\nDM in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), with parameters defined\nat the electroweak scale, is still viable when the low energy spectrum of the\nmodel features light sleptons, in which case, the relic density constraint can\nbe fulfilled. In view of this, we have investigated the viability of light\nneutralinos as DM candidates in the MSSM, with parameters defined at the grand\nunification scale. We have analysed the optimal choices of non-universalities\nin the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters for both, gauginos and scalars,\nin order to avoid the stringent experimental constraints. We show that light\nneutralinos, with a mass as low as 25 GeV, are viable in supergravity scenarios\nif the gaugino mass parameters at high energy are very non universal, while the\nscalar masses can remain of the same order. These scenarios typically predict a\nvery small cross section of neutralinos off protons and neutrons, thereby being\nvery challenging for direct detection experiments. However, a potential\ndetection of smuons and selectrons at the LHC, together with a hypothetical\ndiscovery of a gamma-ray signal from neutralino annihilations in dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies could shed light on this kind of solutions. Finally, we\nhave investigated the naturalness of these scenarios, taking into account all\nthe potential sources of tuning. Besides the electroweak fine-tuning, we have\nfound that the tuning to reproduce the correct DM relic abundance and that to\nmatch the measured Higgs mass can also be important when estimating the total\ndegree of naturalness.\n", "  We study the stability of three analytical solutions of the Einstein's field\nequations for spheres of fluid. These solutions are suitable to describe\ncompact objects including white dwarfs, neutron stars and supermassive stars\nand they have been extensively employed in the literature. We re-examine the\nrange of stability of the Tolman VII solution, we focus on the stability of the\nBuchdahl solution which is under contradiction in the literature and we examine\nthe stability of the Nariai IV solution. We found that all the mentioned\nsolutions are stable in an extensive range of the compactness parameter. We\nalso concentrate on the effect of the adiabatic index on the instability\ncondition. We found that the critical adiabatic index, depends linearly on the\nratio of central pressure over central energy density $P_c/{\\cal E}_c$, up to\nhigh values of the compactness. Finally, we examine the possibility to impose\nconstraints, via the adiabatic index, on realistic equations of state in order\nto ensure stable configurations of compact objects.\n", "  We study the implications of the premise that any new, relativistic, highly\nenergetic neutral particle that interacts with quarks and gluons would create\ncascade-like events in the IceCube (IC) detector. Such events would be\nobservationally indistinguishable from neutral current deep-inelastic\nscattering events due to neutrinos. Consequently, one reason for deviations,\nbreaks or excesses in the expected astrophysical power-law neutrino spectrum\ncould be the flux of such a particle. Motivated by features in the recent\n1347-day IceCube high energy starting event data (HESE), we focus on particular\nboosted dark matter ($\\chi$) related realizations of this premise. Here, $\\chi$\nis assumed to be much lighter than, and the result of, the slow decay of a\nmassive scalar ($\\phi$) which constitutes a major fraction of the Universe's\ndark matter. We show that this hypothesis, coupled with a standard power-law\nastrophysical neutrino flux is capable of providing very good fits to the\npresent data, along with a possible explanation of other features in the HESE\nsample. These features include a) the paucity of events beyond $\\sim 2$ PeV b)\na spectral feature resembling a dip or a spectral change in the 400 TeV--1 PeV\nregion and c) an excess in the $50-100$ TeV region. We consider two different\nboosted DM scenarios, and determine the allowed mass ranges and couplings for\nfour different types of mediators (scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and\naxial-vector) which could connect the standard and dark sectors. We consider\nconstraints from gamma-ray observations and collider searches. We find that the\ngamma-ray observations provide the most restrictive constraints, disfavouring\nthe $1\\sigma$ allowed parameter space from IC fits, while still being\nconsistent with the $3\\sigma$ allowed region. We also test our proposal and its\nimplications against IC's recent six-year through-going muon track data.\n", "  We derive constraints on feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGN) by setting\nlimits on their thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) imprint on the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB). The amplitude of any SZ signature is small and degenerate\nwith the poorly known sub-mm spectral energy distribution of the AGN host\ngalaxy and other unresolved dusty sources along the line of sight. Here we\nbreak this degeneracy by combining microwave and sub-mm data from Planck with\nall-sky far-infrared maps from the AKARI satellite. We first test our\nmeasurement pipeline using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redMaPPer\ncatalogue of galaxy clusters, finding a highly significant detection\n($>$$20\\sigma$) of the SZ effect together with correlated dust emission. We\nthen constrain the SZ signal associated with spectroscopically confirmed\nquasi-stellar objects (QSOs) from SDSS data release 7 (DR7) and the Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) DR12. We obtain a low-significance\n($1.6\\sigma$) hint of an SZ signal, pointing towards a mean thermal energy of\n$\\simeq 5 \\times 10^{60}$ erg, lower than reported in some previous studies. A\ncomparison of our results with high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations\nincluding AGN feedback suggests QSO host masses of $M_{200c} \\sim 4 \\times\n10^{12}~h^{-1}M_\\odot$, but with a large uncertainty. Our analysis provides no\nconclusive evidence for an SZ signal specifically associated with AGN feedback.\n", "  A class of tensor models were recently outlined as potentially calculable\nexamples of holography: their perturbative large-$N$ behavior is similar to the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, but they are fully quantum mechanical (in the\nsense that there is no quenched disorder averaging). These facts make them\nintriguing tentative models for quantum black holes. In this note, we\nexplicitly diagonalize the simplest non-trivial Gurau-Witten tensor model and\nstudy its spectral and late-time properties. We find parallels to (a single\nsample of) SYK where some of these features were recently attributed to random\nmatrix behavior and quantum chaos. In particular, after a running time average,\nthe spectral form factor exhibits striking qualitative similarities to SYK. But\nwe also observe that even though the spectrum has a unique ground state, it has\na huge (quasi-?)degeneracy of intermediate energy states, not seen in SYK. If\none ignores the delta function due to the degeneracies however, there is level\nrepulsion in the unfolded spacing distribution hinting chaos. Furthermore, the\nspectrum has gaps and is not (linearly) rigid. The system also has a spectral\nmirror symmetry which we trace back to the presence of a unitary operator with\nwhich the Hamiltonian anticommutes. We use it to argue that to the extent that\nthe model exhibits random matrix behavior, it is controlled not by the Dyson\nensembles, but by the BDI (chiral orthogonal) class in the Altland-Zirnbauer\nclassification.\n", "  The discovery of a topological nodal-line (TNL) semimetal phase in ZrSiS has\ninvigorated the study of other members of this family. Here, we present a\ncomparative electronic structure study of ZrSiX (where X = S, Se, Te) using\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles\ncalculations. Our ARPES studies show that the overall electronic structure of\nZrSiX materials comprises of the diamond-shaped Fermi pocket, the nearly\nelliptical-shaped Fermi pocket, and a small electron pocket encircling the zone\ncenter ($\\Gamma$) point, the M point, and the X point of the Brillouin zone,\nrespectively. We also observe a small Fermi surface pocket along the\nM-$\\Gamma$-M direction in ZrSiTe, which is absent in both ZrSiS and ZrSiSe.\nFurthermore, our theoretical studies show a transition from nodal-line to\nnodeless gapped phase by tuning the chalcogenide from S to Te in these material\nsystems. Our findings provide direct evidence for the tunability of the TNL\nphase in ZrSiX material systems by adjusting the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\nstrength via the X anion.\n", "  Inter-galactic magnetic fields can imprint their structure on the morphology\nof blazar-induced gamma ray halos. We show that the halo morphology arises\nthrough the interplay of the source's jet and a two-dimensional surface\ndictated by the magnetic field. Through extensive numerical simulations, we\ngenerate mock halos created by stochastic magnetic fields with and without\nhelicity, and study the dependence of the halo features on the properties of\nthe magnetic field. We propose a sharper version of the Q-statistics and\ndemonstrate its sensitivity to the magnetic field strength, the coherence\nscale, and the handedness of the helicity. We also identify and explain a new\nfeature of the Q-statistics that can further enhance its power.\n", "  We consider the discrete Laplacian $\\Delta$ on the cubic lattice $\\mathbb\nZ^d$, and deduce estimates on the group $e^{it\\Delta}$ and the resolvent\n$(\\Delta-z)^{-1}$, weighted by $\\ell^q(\\mathbb Z^d)$-weights for suitable\n$q\\geq 2$. We apply the obtained results to discrete Schr\\\"odinger operators in\ndimension $d\\geq 3$ with potentials from $\\ell^p(\\mathbb Z^d)$ with suitable\n$p\\geq 1$.\n", "  We study a two parameter ($u,p$) extension of the conformally invariant raise\nand peel model. The model also represents a nonlocal and biased-asymmetric\nexclusion process with local and nonlocal jumps of excluded volume particles in\nthe lattice. The model exhibits an unusual and interesting critical phase\nwhere, in the bulk limit, there are an infinite number of absorbing states. In\nspite of these absorbing states the system stays, during a time that increases\nexponentially with the lattice size, in a critical quasi-stationary state. In\nthis critical phase the critical exponents depend only on one of the parameters\ndefining the model ($u$). The endpoint of this critical phase belongs to a\ndistinct universality class, where the system changes from an active to an\ninactive frozen state. This new behavior we believe to be due to the appearance\nof Jordan cells in the Hamiltonian describing the time evolution. The\ndimensions of these cells increases with the lattice size. In a special case\n($u=0$) where the model has no adsorptions we are able to calculate\nanalytically the time evolution of some of the observables. A polynomial time\ndependence is obtained due to the Jordan cells structure of the Hamiltonian.\n", "  We investigate the influence of spatial dispersion on atom-surface quantum\nfriction. We show that for atom-surface separations shorter than the carrier's\nmean free path within the material, the frictional force can be several orders\nof magnitude larger than that predicted by local optics. In addition, when\ntaking into account spatial dispersion effects, we show that the commonly used\nlocal thermal equilibrium approximation underestimates by approximately 95% the\ndrag force, obtained by employing the recently reported nonequilibrium\nfluctuation-dissipation relation for quantum friction. Unlike the treatment\nbased on local optics, spatial dispersion in conjunction with corrections to\nlocal thermal equilibrium not only change the magnitude but also the distance\nscaling of quantum friction.\n", "  A general theory of photon-mediated energy and momentum transfer in N-body\nplanar systems out of thermal equilibrium is introduced. It is based on the\ncombination of the scattering theory and the fluctuational-electrodynamics\napproach in many-body systems. By making a Landauer-like formulation of the\nheat transfer problem, explicit formulas for the energy transmission\ncoefficients between two distinct slabs as well as the self-coupling\ncoefficients are derived and expressed in terms of the reflection and\ntransmission coefficients of the single bodies. We also show how to calculate\nlocal equilibrium temperatures in such systems. An analogous formulation is\nintroduced to quantify momentum transfer coefficients describing\nCasimir-Lifshitz forces out of thermal equilibrium. Forces at thermal\nequilibrium are readily obtained as a particular case. As an illustration of\nthis general theoretical framework, we show on three-body systems how the\npresence of a fourth slab can impact equilibrium temperatures in heat-transfer\nproblems and equilibrium positions resulting from the forces acting on the\nsystem.\n", "  We study the effect of antiferromagnetic longitudinal coupling on the\none-dimensional transverse field Ising model with nearest-neighbour couplings.\nIn the topological phase where, in the thermodynamic limit, the ground state is\ntwofold degenerate, we show that, for a finite system of N sites, the\nlongitudinal coupling induces N level crossings between the two lowest lying\nstates as a function of the field. We also provide strong arguments suggesting\nthat these N level crossings all appear simultaneously as soon as the\nlongitudinal coupling is switched on. This conclusion is based on perturbation\ntheory, and a mapping of the problem onto the open Kitaev chain, for which we\nwrite down the complete solution in terms of Majorana fermions.\n", "  We investigate the sensitivity of top-Higgs coupling by considering the\nassociated vertex as CP phase ($\\zeta_t$) dependent through the process $p\\,\ne^- \\to \\bar t \\,h \\,\\nu_e$ in the future Large Hadron electron collider. In\nparticular the decay modes are taken to be $h \\to b\\bar b$ and $\\bar t \\to$\nleptonic mode. Several distinct $\\zeta_t$ dependent features are demonstrated\nby considering observables like cross sections, top-quark polarisation,\nrapidity difference between $h$ and $\\bar t$ and different angular asymmetries.\nLuminosity ($L$) dependent exclusion limits are obtained for $\\zeta_t$ by\nconsidering significance based on fiducial cross sections at different\n$\\sigma$-levels. For electron and proton beam-energies of 60 GeV and 7 TeV\nrespectively, at $L = 100$~fb$^{-1}$, the regions above $\\pi/5 < \\zeta_t \\leq\n\\pi$ are excluded at 2$\\sigma$ confidence level, which reflects better\nsensitivity expected at the Large Hadron Collider. With appropriate error\nfitting methodology we find that the accuracy of SM top-Higgs coupling could be\nmeasured to be $\\kappa = 1.00 \\pm 0.17 (0.08)$ at $\\sqrt{s} = 1.3 (1.8)$ TeV\nfor an ultimate $L = 1 \\,\\rm{ab}^{-1}$.\n", "  Several active areas of research in novel energy storage technologies,\nincluding three-dimensional solid state batteries and passivation coatings for\nreactive battery electrode components, require conformal solid state\nelectrolytes. We describe an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process for a member\nof the lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) family, which is employed as a\nthin film lithium-conducting solid electrolyte. The reaction between lithium\ntert-butoxide (LiO$^t$Bu) and diethyl phosphoramidate (DEPA) produces\nconformal, ionically conductive thin films with a stoichiometry close to\nLi$_2$PO$_2$N between 250 and 300$^\\circ$C. The P/N ratio of the films is\nalways 1, indicative of a particular polymorph of LiPON which closely resembles\na polyphosphazene. Films grown at 300$^\\circ$C have an ionic conductivity of\n$6.51\\:(\\pm0.36)\\times10^{-7}$ S/cm at 35$^\\circ$C, and are functionally\nelectrochemically stable in the window from 0 to 5.3V vs. Li/Li$^+$. We\ndemonstrate the viability of the ALD-grown electrolyte by integrating it into\nfull solid state batteries, including thin film devices using LiCoO$_2$ as the\ncathode and Si as the anode operating at up to 1 mA/cm$^2$. The high quality of\nthe ALD growth process allows pinhole-free deposition even on rough crystalline\nsurfaces, and we demonstrate the fabrication and operation of thin film\nbatteries with the thinnest (<100nm) solid state electrolytes yet reported.\nFinally, we show an additional application of the moderate-temperature ALD\nprocess by demonstrating a flexible solid state battery fabricated on a polymer\nsubstrate.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale windings of the spin configuration that hold\ngreat promise for technology due to their topology-related properties and\nextremely reduced sizes. After the recent observation at room temperature of\nsub-100 nm skyrmions stabilized by interfacial chiral interaction in magnetic\nmultilayers, several pending questions remain to be solved, notably about the\nmeans to nucleate individual compact skyrmions or the exact nature of their\nmotion. In this study, a method leading to the formation of magnetic skyrmions\nin a micrometer-sized nanotrack using homogeneous current injection is\nevidenced. Spin-transfer-induced motion of these small\nelectricalcurrent-generated skyrmions is then demonstrated and the role of the\nout-of-plane magnetic field in the stabilization of the moving skyrmions is\nalso analysed. The results of these experimental observations of spin torque\ninduced motion are compared to micromagnetic simulations reproducing a granular\ntype, non-uniform magnetic multilayer, in order to address the particularly\nimportant role of the magnetic inhomogeneities on the current-induced motion of\nsub-100 nm skyrmions, for which the material grains size is comparable to the\nskyrmion diameter.\n", "  Since galaxy clusters sit at the high-end of the mass function, the number of\ngalaxy clusters both massive and concentrated enough to yield particularly\nlarge Einstein radii poses useful constraints on cosmological and structure\nformation models. To date, less than a handful of clusters are known to have\nEinstein radii exceeding $\\sim40$\" (for a source at $z_{s}\\simeq2$, nominally).\nHere, we report an addition to that list of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)\nselected cluster, PLCK G287.0+32.9 ($z=0.38$), the second-highest SZ-mass\n($M_{500}$) cluster from the Planck catalog. We present the first strong\nlensing analysis of the cluster, identifying 20 sets of multiply-imaged\ngalaxies and candidates in new \\emph{Hubble Space Telescope} data, including a\nlong, $l\\sim22$\" giant arc, as well as a quadruply-imaged, apparently bright\n(magnified to J$_{F110W}=$25.3 AB), likely high-redshift dropout galaxy at\n$z_{phot}=6.90$ [6.13--8.43] (95\\% C.I.). Our analysis reveals a very large\ncritical area (1.55 arcmin$^{2}$, $z_{s}\\simeq2$), corresponding to an\neffective Einstein radius of $\\theta_{E}\\sim42$\". The model suggests the\ncritical area will expand to 2.58 arcmin$^{2}$ ($\\theta_{E}\\sim54$\") for\nsources at $z_{s}\\sim10$. Our work adds to recent efforts to model very massive\nclusters towards the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, in order to\nidentify the most useful cosmic lenses for studying the early Universe.\nSpectroscopic redshifts for the multiply-imaged galaxies and additional HST\ndata will be necessary for refining the lens model and verifying the nature of\nthe $z\\sim7$ dropout.\n", "  The radiative association of C(${}^3P$) and H${}^+$ is investigated by\ncalculating cross sections for photon emission into bound ro-vibrational states\nof CH${}^+$ from the vibrational continua of initial triplet d$\\,{}^3\\Pi$ or\nb$\\,{}^3\\Sigma^-$ states. Potential energy curves and transition dipole moments\nare calculated using multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) methods\nwith AV6Z basis sets. The cross sections are evaluated using quantum-mechanical\nmethods and rate coefficients are calculated. The rate coefficients are about\n100 times larger than those for radiative association of C${}^+({}^2{P^o})$ and\nH from the A$\\,{}^1\\Pi$ state. We also confirm that the formation of CH${}^+$\nby radiative association of C${}^+({}^2{P^o})$ and H via the triplet\nc$\\,{}^3\\Sigma^+$ state is a minor process.\n", "  Donut-shaped laser radiation, carrying orbital angular momentum, namely\noptical vortex, recently was shown to provide vectorial mass transfer, twisting\ntransiently molten material and producing chiral micro-scale structures on\nsurfaces of different bulk materials upon their resolidification. In this\npaper, we show for the first time that nanosecond laser vortices can produce\nchiral nanoneedles (nanojets) of variable size on thin films of such plasmonic\nmaterials, as silver and gold films, covering thermally insulating substrates.\nMain geometric parameters of the produced chiral nanojets, such as height and\naspect ratio, were shown to be tunable in a wide range by varying metal film\nthickness, supporting substrates, and the optical size of the vortex beam.\nDonut-shaped vortex nanosecond laser pulses, carrying two vortices with\nopposite handedness, were demonstrated to produce two chiral nanojets twisted\nin opposite directions. The results provide new important insights into\nfundamental physics of the vectorial laser-beam assisted mass transfer in metal\nfilms and demonstrate the great potential of this technique for fast\neasy-to-implement fabrication of chiral plasmonic nanostructures.\n", "  We perform a general study of the relic density and LHC constraints on\nsimplified models where the dark matter coannihilates with a strongly\ninteracting particle X. In these models, the dark matter depletion is driven by\nthe self-annihilation of X to pairs of quarks and gluons through the strong\ninteraction. The phenomenology of these scenarios therefore only depends on the\ndark matter mass and the mass splitting between dark matter and X as well as\nthe quantum numbers of X. In this paper, we consider simplified models where X\ncan be either a scalar, a fermion or a vector, as well as a color triplet,\nsextet or octet. We compute the dark matter relic density constraints taking\ninto account Sommerfeld corrections and bound state formation. Furthermore, we\nexamine the restrictions from thermal equilibrium, the lifetime of X and the\ncurrent and future LHC bounds on X pair production. All constraints are\ncomprehensively presented in the mass splitting versus dark matter mass plane.\nWhile the relic density constraints can lead to upper bounds on the dark matter\nmass ranging from 2 TeV to more than 10 TeV across our models, the prospective\nLHC bounds range from 800 to 1500 GeV. A full coverage of the strongly\ncoannihilating dark matter parameter space would therefore require hadron\ncolliders with significantly higher center of mass energies.\n", "  We consider an analytically solvable model of two interacting electrons that\nallows for the calculation of the exact exchange-correlation kernel of\ntime-dependent density functional theory. This kernel, as well as the\ncorresponding density response function, is studied in the limit of large\nrepulsive interactions between the electrons and we give analytical results for\nthese quantities as an asymptotic expansion in powers of the square root of the\ninteraction strength. We find that in the strong interaction limit the three\nleading terms in the expansion of the kernel act instantaneously while memory\nterms only appear in the next orders. We further derive an alternative\nexpansion for the kernel in the strong interaction limit on the basis of the\ntheory developed in [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 18, 21092 (2016)] using the\nformalism of strictly correlated electrons in the adiabatic approximation. We\nfind that the first two leading terms in this series, corresponding to the\nstrictly correlated limit and its zero-point vibration correction, coincide\nwith the two leading terms of the exact expansion. We finally analyze the\nspatial non-locality of these terms and show when the adiabatic approximation\nbreaks down. The ability to reproduce the exact kernel in the strong\ninteraction limit indicates that the adiabatic strictly correlated electron\nformalism is useful for studying the density response and excitation properties\nof other systems with strong electronic interactions.\n", "  We apply the transformation-optics approach to the design of a metamaterial\nradome that can extend the scanning angle of a phased-array antenna. For\nmoderate enhancement of the scanning angle, via suitable parameterization and\noptimization of the coordinate transformation, we obtain a design that admits a\ntechnologically viable, robust and potentially broadband implementation in\nterms of thin-metallic-plate inclusions. Our results, validated via\nfinite-element-based numerical simulations, indicate an alternative route to\nthe design of metamaterial radomes which does not require negative-valued\nand/or extreme constitutive parameters.\n", "  We define a quaternionic extension of the Szegedy walk on a graph and study\nits right spectral properties. The condition for the transition matrix of the\nquaternionic Szegedy walk on a graph to be quaternionic unitary is given. In\norder to derive the spectral mapping theorem for the quaternionic Szegedy walk,\nwe derive a quaternionic extension of the determinant expression of the second\nweighted zeta function of a graph. Our main results determine explicitly all\nthe right eigenvalues of the quaternionic Szegedy walk by using complex right\neigenvalues of the corresponding doubly weighted matrix. We also show the way\nto obtain eigenvectors corresponding to right eigenvalues derived from those of\ndoubly weighted matrix.\n", "  This Rescaled Subset of the Alternative Data Release 1 to the Tata Institute\nof Fundamental Physics Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope Sky Survey (TGSS-RSADR1)\nmodifies the initial data release of TGSS-ADR1 (Intema et al. 2017) to bring\nthat catalogue to the same flux scale as the extragalactic catalogue from the\nGaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array survey (GLEAM:\nWayth et al. 2015; Hurley-Walker et al. 2017). In this paper we motivate the\nderivation of correct and complementary flux density scales, introduce a\nmethodology for correction based on radial basis functions, apply it to\nTGSS-ADR1, and create a modified catalogue, TGSS-RSADR1. This catalogue\ncomprises 383,589 TGSS-ADR1 sources with updated flux density and flux density\nuncertainty values, and covers $\\mathrm{Declination}\\leq+30^\\circ$,\n$|b|\\geq10^\\circ$, a sky area of 18,800 deg$^2$.\n", "  We study the inflationary perturbations in general (classically)\nscale-invariant theories. Such scenario is motivated by the hierarchy problem\nand provides natural inflationary potentials and dark matter candidates. We\nanalyse in detail all sectors (the scalar, vector and tensor perturbations)\ngiving general formulae for the potentially observable power spectra, as well\nas for the curvature spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.\nWe show that the conserved Hamiltonian for all perturbations does not feature\nnegative energies even in the presence of the Weyl-squared term if the\nappropriate quantization is performed and argue that this term does not lead to\nphenomenological problems at least in some relevant setups. The general\nformulae are then applied to a concrete no-scale model, which includes the\nhiggs and a scalar, \"the planckion\", whose vacuum expectation value generates\nthe Planck mass. Inflation can be triggered by a combination of the planckion\nand the Starobinsky scalar and we show that no tension with observations is\npresent even in the case of pure planckion-inflation, if the coefficient of the\nWeyl-squared term is large enough. In general, even quadratic inflation is\nallowed in this case. Moreover, the Weyl-squared term leads to an isocurvature\nmode, which currently satisfies the observational bounds, but may be detectable\nwith future experiments.\n", "  Motivated by the recent experiments indicating superconductivity in\nmetal-decorated graphene sheets, we investigate their quasi-particle structure\nwithin the framework of an effective tight-binding Hamiltonian augmented by\nappropriate BCS-like pairing terms for p-type order parameter. The normal state\nband structure of graphene is modified not only through interaction with\nadsorbed metal atoms, but also due to the folding of bands at Brillouin zone\nboundaries resulting from a $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}R30^{\\circ}$ reconstruction.\nSeveral different types of pairing symmetries are analyzed utilizing\nNambu-Gorkov Green's function techniques to show that $p+ip$-symmetric\nnearest-neighbor pairing yields the most enhanced superconducting gap. The\ncharacter of the order parameter depends on the nature of the atomic orbitals\ninvolved in the pairing process and exhibits interesting angular and radial\nasymmetries. Finally, we suggest a method to distinguish between singlet and\ntriplet type superconductivity in the presence of magnetic substitutional\nimpurities using scanning tunneling spectroscopy.\n", "  We present a photometric follow-up of transiting exoplanets HAT-P-3b and\nTrES-3b, observed by using several optical and near-infrared filters, with four\nsmall-class telescopes (D = 36--152cm) in the Northern Hemisphere. Two of the\nfacilities present their first scientific results. New 10 HAT-P-3b light curves\nand new 26 TrES-3b light curves are reduced and combined by filter in order to\nimprove the quality of the photometry. Combined light curves fitting is carried\nout independently by using two different analysis packages, allowing the\ncorroboration of the orbital and physical parameters in the literature. Results\nfind no differences in the relative radius with the observing filter. In\nparticular, we report for HAT-P-3b a first estimation of the planet-to-star\nradius Rp/R* = 0.1112+0.0025-0.0026 in the B band which is coherent with values\nfound in the VRIz'JH filters. Concerning TrES-3b, we derive a value for the\norbital period of P = 1.3061862+-0.0000001 days which shows no linear\nvariations over nine years of photometric observations.\n", "  We have found some analytical cosmological solutions to MOdified Gravity\n(MOG). These solutions describe different evolutionary epochs of an isotropic\nand homogeneous universe. During each epoch, the evolution of cosmological\nperturbation is studied in the Newtonian framework and compared with the\ncorresponding results of GR.\n", "  Solitons occur in many physical systems when a nonlinearity compensates wave\ndispersion. Their recent formation in microresonators opens a new research\ndirection for nonlinear optical physics and provides a platform for\nminiaturization of spectroscopy and frequency metrology systems. These\nmicroresonator solitons orbit around a closed waveguide path and produce a\nrepetitive output pulse stream at a rate set by the round-trip time. In this\nwork counter-propagating solitons that simultaneously orbit in an opposing\nsense (clockwise/counter-clockwise) are studied. Despite sharing the same\nspatial mode family, their round-trip times can be precisely and independently\ncontrolled. Furthermore, a state is possible in which both the relative optical\nphase and relative repetition rates of the distinct soliton streams are locked.\nThis state allows a single resonator to produce dual-soliton frequency-comb\nstreams having different repetition rates, but with high relative coherence\nuseful in both spectroscopy and laser ranging systems.\n", "  Enhancing the collection efficiency of single emitters via dielectric\nantennas is a common approach in research dealing with solid-state quantum\nlight sources. Current design concepts often suffer from a large footprint,\nquenching or a complex fabrication process. Here we report on another design\nwhere the Kerker effect is used to collimate emission from a nitrogen vacancy\n(NV) center. The structure discussed here is an easy to fabricate cylindrical\nprotrusion made from diamond on top of a diamond substrate with NVs\nincorporated into its center. We optimize the structure with respect to\napplication in quantum information processing and quantum sensing and find an\nup to 15 times higher photon extraction.\n", "  We carried out a pilot campaign of radio and optical band intra-day\nvariability (IDV) observations of five blazars (3C66A, S5 0716+714, OJ287,\nB0925+504, and BL Lacertae) on December 18--21, 2015 by using the radio\ntelescope in Effelsberg (Germany) and several optical telescopes in Asia,\nEurope, and America. After calibration, the light curves from both 5 GHz radio\nband and the optical R band were obtained, although the data were not smoothly\nsampled over the sampling period of about four days. We tentatively analyse the\namplitudes and time scales of the variabilities, and any possible periodicity.\nThe blazars vary significantly in the radio (except 3C66A and BL Lacertae with\nonly marginal variations) and optical bands on intra- and inter-day time\nscales, and the source B0925+504 exhibits a strong quasi-periodic radio\nvariability. No significant correlation between the radio- and optical-band\nvariability appears in the five sources, which we attribute to the radio IDV\nbeing dominated by interstellar scintillation whereas the optical variability\ncomes from the source itself. However, the radio- and optical-band variations\nappear to be weakly correlated in some sources and should be investigated based\non well-sampled data from future observations.\n", "  The Curie temperature ($T_C$) of binary alloy compounds consisting of 3$d$\ntransition-metal and 4$f$ rare-earth elements is analyzed by a machine learning\ntechnique. We first demonstrate that nonlinear regression can accurately\nreproduce $T_C$ of the compounds. The prediction accuracy for $T_C$ is\nmaximized when five to ten descriptors are selected, with the rare-earth\nconcentration being the most relevant. We then discuss an attempt to utilize a\nregression-based model selection technique to learn the relation between the\ndescriptors and the actuation mechanism of the corresponding physical\nphenomenon, i.e., $T_C$ in the present case.\n", "  The insulating pyrochlore compound Nd2Sn2O7 has been shown to undergo a\nsecond order magnetic phase transition at Tc ~ 0.91 K to a noncoplanar\nall-in--all-out magnetic structure of the Nd3+ magnetic moments. An anomalously\nslow paramagnetic spin dynamics has been evidenced from neutron backscattering\nand muon spin relaxation (muSR). In the case of muSR this has been revealed\nthrough the strong effect of a 50 mT longitudinal field on the spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate. Here, motivated by a recent successful work performed for\nYb2Ti2O7 and Yb2Sn2O7, analyzing the shape of the muSR longitudinal\npolarization function, we substantiate the existence of extremely slow\nparamagnetic spin dynamics in the microsecond time range for Nd2Sn2O7. Between\n1.7 and 7 K, this time scale is temperature independent. This suggests a double\nspin-flip tunneling relaxation mechanism to be at play, probably involving spin\nsubstructures such as tetrahedra. Unexpectedly, the standard deviation of the\nfield distribution at the muon site increases as the system is cooled. This\nexotic spin dynamics is in sharp contrast with the dynamics above 100 K which\nis driven by the Orbach relaxation mechanism involving single Nd3+ magnetic\nmoments.\n", "  We propose a novel representation of crystalline materials named\norbital-field matrix (OFM) based on the distribution of valence shell\nelectrons. We demonstrate that this new representation can be highly useful in\nmining material data. Our experiment shows that the formation energies of\ncrystalline materials, the atomization energies of molecular materials, and the\nlocal magnetic moments of the constituent atoms in transition metal--rare-earth\nmetal bimetal alloys can be predicted with high accuracy using the OFM.\nKnowledge regarding the role of coordination numbers of transition-metal and\nrare-earth metal elements in determining the local magnetic moment of\ntransition metal sites can be acquired directly from decision tree regression\nanalyses using the OFM.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions (MS) are particle-like spin structures with whirling\nconfiguration, which are promising candidates for spin-based memory. MS\ncontains alluring features including remarkably high stability, ultra low\ndriving current density, and compact size. Due to their higher stability and\nlower drive current requirement for movement, skyrmions have great potential in\nenergy efficient spintronic device applications. We propose a skyrmion-based\ncache memory where data can be stored in a long nanotrack as multiple bits.\nWrite operation (formation of skyrmion) can be achieved by injecting spin\npolarized current in a magnetic nanotrack and subsequently shifting the MS in\neither direction along the nanotrack using charge current through a spin-Hall\nmetal (SHM), underneath the magnetic layer. The presence of skyrmion can alter\nthe resistance of a magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) at the read port.\nConsidering the read and write latency along the long nanotrack cache memory, a\nstrategy of multiple read and write operations is discussed. Besides, the size\nof a skyrmion affects the packing density, current induced motion velocity, and\nreadability (change of resistance while sensing the existence of a skyrmion).\nDesign optimization to mitigate the above effects is also investigated.\n", "  This letter presents the design, manufacturing and operational performance of\na graphene-flakes based screenprinted wideband elliptical dipole antenna\noperating from 2 GHz up to 5 GHz for low cost wireless communications\napplications. To investigate radio frequency (RF) conductivity of the printed\ngraphene, a coplanar waveguide (CPW) test structure was designed, fabricated\nand tested in the frequency range from 1 GHz to 20 GHz. Antenna and CPW were\nscreen-printed on Kapton substrates using a graphene paste formulated with a\ngraphene to binder ratio of 1:2. A combination of thermal treatment and\nsubsequent compression rolling is utilized to further decrease the sheet\nresistance for printed graphene structures, ultimately reaching 4 Ohm/sq. at 10\n{\\mu}m thicknesses. For the graphene-flakes printed antenna an antenna\nefficiency of 60% is obtained. The measured maximum antenna gain is 2.3 dBi at\n4.8 GHz. Thus the graphene-flakes printed antenna adds a total loss of only 3.1\ndB to an RF link when compared to the same structure screen-printed for\nreference with a commercial silver ink. This shows that the electrical\nperformance of screen-printed graphene flakes, which also does not degrade\nafter repeated bending, is suitable for realizing low-cost wearable RF wireless\ncommunication devices.\n", "  This article provides answers to the two questions posed in the title. It is\nargued that, contrary to many statements made in the literature, neither\nentropy, nor the Second Law may be used for the entire universe. The origin of\nthis misuse of entropy and the second law may be traced back to Clausius\nhimself. More resent (erroneous) justification is also discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we have studied the Hawking radiation of massive spin-$1$\nparticles from the black holes in $(2+1)$ dimensions with non- trivial dilaton\nfields. We consider two special varities of these black holes one is static\ncharged and other is spinning electrically neutral. By applying the standard\nmethod of $WKB$ approximation and Hamilton- Jacobi ansatz we have shown the\ntunneling probability and Hawking temperature of massive bosons accordingly. In\nthe certain limit of the dilaton coupling for spinning neutral case we have\nrecovered the Hawking temperature of the $BTZ$ black holes as well.\n", "  The interpretation of so-called cosmic string in black hole spacetimes has\nsettled down to an unsatisfactory state.\n  In this article we try to provide a different model for these cosmic strings\nby explicit construction of these spacetimes from the Bonnor rocket solution.\nIt is shown that the correct stress-energy tensor is that of null dust with a\nrather strange energy density --- first derivative of Dirac delta distribution.\n  We will discuss the Schwarzschild solution and the C--metric. In the latter\ncase we will show that there is a momentum flux through the cosmic string,\ncausing the acceleration of the black hole.\n", "  We model non-stationary volume-price distributions with a log-normal\ndistribution and collect the time series of its two parameters. The time series\nof the two parameters are shown to be stationary and Markov-like and\nconsequently can be modelled with Langevin equations, which are derived\ndirectly from their series of values. Having the evolution equations of the\nlog-normal parameters, we reconstruct the statistics of the first moments of\nvolume-price distributions which fit well the empirical data. Finally, the\nproposed framework is general enough to study other non-stationary stochastic\nvariables in other research fields, namely biology, medicine and geology.\n", "  A method for calculating the meridian profile of the aspherical surface of a\nplane-convex lens excluding spherical aberration, without calculating the\ncoefficients of the series, by direct solving the compiled differential\nequation is proposed. The differential equation of an aspherical lens was\ncompiled, found its numerical solution, and got the meridian profile of an\naspherical lens. For long-focus lenses found conditions to simplify the\ndifferential equation.\n", "  The angular two-point correlation function of the temperature of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB), as inferred from nearly all-sky maps, is very close\nto zero on large angular scales. A statistic invented to quantify this feature,\n$S_{1/2}$, has a value sufficiently low that only about 7 in 1000 simulations\ngenerated assuming the standard cosmological model have lower values; i.e., it\nhas a $p$-value of 0.007. As such, it is one of several unusual features of the\nCMB sky on large scales, including the low value of the observed CMB\nquadrupole, whose importance is unclear: are they multiple and independent\nclues about physics beyond the cosmological standard model, or an expected\nconsequence of our ability to find signals in Gaussian noise? We find they are\nnot independent: using only simulations with quadrupole values near the\nobserved one, the $S_{1/2}$ $p$-value increases from 0.007 to 0.08. We also\nfind strong evidence that corrections for a \"look-elsewhere effect\" are large.\nTo do so, we use a one-dimensional generalization of the $S_{1/2}$ statistic,\nand select along the one dimension for the statistic that is most extreme.\nSubjecting our simulations to this process increases the $p$-value from 0.007\nto 0.03; a result similar to that found in Planck XVI (2016). We argue that\nthis optimization process along the one dimension provides an $underestimate$\nof the look-elsewhere effect correction for the historical human process of\nselecting the $S_{1/2}$ statistic from a very high-dimensional space of\nalternative statistics $after$ having examined the data.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), with their two-dimensional\nstructures and sizable bandgaps, are good candidates for barrier materials in\ntunneling field-effect transistor (TFET) formed from atomic precision vertical\nstacks of graphene and insulating crystals of a few atomic layers in thickness.\nWe report first-principles study of the electronic properties of the\nGraphene/WS$_2$/Graphene sandwich structure revealing strong interface effects\non dielectric properties and predicting a high ON/OFF ratio with an appropriate\nWS$_2$ thickness and a suitable range of the gate voltage. Both the band\nspin-orbit coupling splitting and the dielectric constant of the WS$_2$ layer\ndepend on its thickness when in contact with the graphene electrodes,\nindicating strong influence from graphene across the interfaces. The dielectric\nconstant is significantly reduced from the bulk WS$_2$ value. The effective\nbarrier height varies with WS$_2$ thickness and can be tuned by a gate voltage.\nThese results are critical for future nanoelectronic device designs.\n", "  On a time-oriented Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$ with non-empty boundary\nsatisfying a convexity assumption, we show that the topological,\ndifferentiable, and conformal structure of suitable subsets $S\\subset M$ of\nsources is uniquely determined by measurements of the intersection of future\nlight cones from points in $S$ with a fixed open subset of the boundary of $M$;\nhere, light rays are reflected at $\\partial M$ according to Snell's law. Our\nproof is constructive, and allows for interior conjugate points as well as\nmultiply reflected and self-intersecting light cones.\n", "  One of main events on Rapanui before the cruel war (several wars) between the\nHanau Momoko and Hanau Eepe was the annual election of the bird-man. Plainly,\nthe local priest-astronomers, the descendants of immigrants from the Andean\nregion of South America, could predict the day of the vernal equinox not only\nwith the aid of the so-called \"sun stones,\" but also counting the phases of the\nmoon. The elements of the mathematical calculations of the astronomers have\nbeen deciphered. The astronomical basis of the Ahu Atanga (A Tanga) has been\ndecoded, too.\n", "  We present the results of a search for extremely metal-poor (EMP),\ncarbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP), and cataclysmic variable (CV) stars using a\nnew exploration tool based on linked scatter plots (LSPs). Our approach is\nespecially designed to work with very large spectrum data sets such as the\nSDSS, LAMOST, RAVE, and Gaia data sets, and it can be applied to stellar,\ngalaxy, and quasar spectra. As a demonstration, we conduct our search using the\nSDSS DR10 data set. We first created a 3326-dimensional phase space containing\nnearly 2 billion measures of the strengths of over 1600 spectral features in\n569,738 SDSS stars. These measures capture essentially all the stellar atomic\nand molecular species visible at the resolution of SDSS spectra. We show how\nLSPs can be used to quickly isolate and examine interesting portions of this\nphase space. To illustrate, we use LSPs coupled with cuts in selected portions\nof phase space to extract EMP stars, CEMP stars, and CV stars. We present\nidentifications for 59 previously unrecognized candidate EMP stars and 11\npreviously unrecognized candidate CEMP stars. We also call attention to 2\ncandidate He~II emission CV stars found by the LSP approach that have not yet\nbeen discussed in the literature.\n", "  Alloying/doping in two-dimensional material has been important due to wide\nrange band gap tunability. Increasing the number of components would increase\nthe degree of freedom which can provide more flexibility in tuning the band gap\nand also reduced the growth temperature. Here, we report synthesis of\nquaternary alloys MoxW1-xS2ySe2(1-y) using chemical vapour deposition. The\ncomposition of alloys has been tuned by changing the growth temperatures. As a\nresult, we can tune the bandgap which varies from 1.73 eV to 1.84 eV. The\ndetailed theoretical calculation supports the experimental observation and\nshows a possibility of wide tunability of bandgap.\n", "  Protein folding processes are generally described statistically with the help\nof multidimensional free energy landscape, typically reduced to a 1-D free\nenergy profile along good reaction co-ordinate. There are many physical\nparameters which are responsible for protein molecule to hop between the native\nand unfolded states. The transition path region across the barrier is the\nregion corresponding to the minimum fluctuation. The extent to which this\ntransition region can extend beyond the obvious 1/2 kBT region has been a\nquestion of interest for a long time. We propose a new method to locate this\ntransition path region and to study its dependence on the asymmetry of the\ntransition state for a given free energy landscape. We have performed Brownian\ndynamics simulations with Gaussian white noise and Monte-Carlo simulation by\nsampling ten thousand successful transitions across the barrier for three\ndifferent energy landscape having fixed barrier height with asymmetry in their\ncurvatures. It was found that the transition path region increases with the\nincrease in the asymmetry of the energy landscape in the transition region. The\nrate limiting parameter diffusion constant over the diffusive barrier, rate\nconstant at particular force and transition path time for different potentials\nwere estimated directly from the landscape profile using Kramers theory for\ndiffusive barrier crossing. It was also found that the average diffusion in the\nnative state increases with the increase in the asymmetry of the transition\nstate towards the non-native state.\n", "  We describe a dispersive unit consisting of cascaded volume-phase holographic\ngratings for spectroscopic applications. Each of the gratings provides high\ndiffractive efficiency in a relatively narrow wavelength range and transmits\nthe rest of the radiation to the 0th order of diffraction. The spectral lines\nformed by different gratings are centered in the longitudal direction and\nseparated in the transverse direction due to tilt of the gratings around two\naxes. We consider a technique of design and optimization of such a scheme. It\nallows to define modulation of index of refraction and thickness of the\nholographic layer for each of the gratings as well as their fringes frequencies\nand inclination angles. At the first stage the gratings parameters are found\napproximately using analytical expressions of Kogelnik's coupled wave theory.\nThen each of the grating starting from the longwave sub-range is optimized\nseparately by using of numerical optimization procedure and rigorous coupled\nwave analysis to achieve a high diffraction efficiency profile with a steep\nshortwave edge. In parallel such targets as ray aiming and linear dispersion\nmaintenance are controlled by means of ray tracing. We demonstrate this\ntechnique on example of a small-sized spectrograph for astronomical\napplications. It works in the range of 500-650 nm and uses three gratings\ncovering 50 nm each. It has spectral resolution of 6130 - 12548. Obtaining of\nthe asymmetrical efficiency curve is shown with use of dichromated gelatin and\na photopolymer. Change of the curve shape allows to increase filling\ncoefficient for the target sub-range up to 2.3 times.\n", "  The preparation of mixed crystals of NaBr and KBr from melt as well as their\nphysical characterization have been reported. Electrical measurements were\ncarried out at various temperatures, which showed that their conductivity\nincreases with the increase in temperature and varies nonlinearly with the bulk\ncomposition. We find that for most of the compositions studied, the activation\nenergy deduced from the temperature variation of their conductivity obeys a\nthermodynamical model that interrelates the defect Gibbs energy with the bulk\nelastic and expansivity data.\n", "  We discuss the implications of the latest NO$ \\nu $A results on the\nmeasurement of $\\nu_\\mu - \\nu_e$ conversions. From a combined analysis of the\ndisappearance and appearance data, the preferred solutions reported by NO$ \\nu\n$A are normal hierarchy (NH) with two degenerate best-fit points one in the\nlower octant (LO) and $ \\delta_{CP} = 1.48\\pi$ whereas the other in the higher\noctant (HO) with $ \\delta_{CP} = 0.74\\pi$. There is also another solution with\ninverted hierarchy (IH) which is $0.46 \\sigma$ away from the best-fit. We\ndiscuss and quantify the possibility of resolving these degeneracies by\ninclusion of NO$ \\nu $A antineutrino runs. We show that if the true solution\ncorresponds to (NH, LO, $\\sim 1.48\\pi$) then future data from NO$ \\nu $A\ncomprising of 3 years of neutrino and 3 years of antineutrino run will be able\nto resolve the degenerate solutions at 95.45\\% C.L. However, if the true\nsolution corresponds to (NH, HO, $\\sim 0.74\\pi$), a wrong hierarchy-wrong $\n\\delta_{CP} $ solution remains unresolved even at 68\\% C.L. with the full\n$3\\nu+3\\bar{\\nu}$ projected run of NO$ \\nu $A. Same is the case if the IH\nsolution turns out to be the true solution. We further show that DUNE (10 kton)\nwill be able to resolve these degenerate solutions at 99.73\\% C.L. with only 1\nyear of neutrino and one year of antineutrino run [1+1] while 5+5 years of DUNE\ndata can resolve the degeneracies at 99.99\\% C.L.\n", "  We argue that the curvature generated by a gravitational field can be used to\ncalculate the corresponding metric which determines the trajectories of freely\nfalling test particles. To this end, we present a method to compute the metric\nfrom a given curvature tensor. We use Petrov's classification to handle the\nstructure and properties of the curvature tensor, and Cartan's structure\nequations in an orthonormal tetrad to investigate the differential equations\nthat relate the curvature with the metric. The second structure equation is\nintegrated to obtain the explicit expression for the connection $1-$form from\nwhich the components of the orthonormal tetrad are obtained by using the first\nstructure equation. This opens the possibility of using the curvature of\nastrophysical objects like the Earth to determine the position of freely\nfalling satellites that are used in modern navigation systems.\n", "  In heterogeneous solids such as rocks and concrete, the speed of sound\ndiminishes with the strain amplitude of a dynamic loading (softening). This\ndecrease known as \"slow dynamics\" occurs at time scales larger than the period\nof the forcing. Also, hysteresis is observed in the steady-state response. The\nphenomenological model by Vakhnenko et al. is based on a variable that\ndescribes the softening of the material [Phys. Rev. E 70-1, 2004]. However,\nthis model is 1D and it is not thermodynamically admissible. In the present\narticle, a 3D model is derived in the framework of the finite strain theory. An\ninternal variable that describes the softening of the material is introduced,\nas well as an expression of the specific internal energy. A mechanical\nconstitu-tive law is deduced from the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Moreover, a\nfamily of evolution equations for the internal variable is proposed. Here, an\nevolution equation with one relaxation time is chosen. By construction, this\nnew model of continuum is thermodynamically admissible and dissipative\n(inelas-tic). In the case of small uniaxial deformations, it is shown\nanalytically that the model reproduces qualitatively the main features of real\nexperiments.\n", "  Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently gained a strong interest as a\nstrategic component in engineering van der Waals heterostructures built with\ntwo dimensional crystals such as graphene. This work reports micro-Raman\nmeasurements on hBN flakes made of a few atomic layers, prepared by mechanical\nexfoliation. The temperature dependence of the Raman scattering in hBN is\ninvestigated first such as to define appropriate measurements conditions\nsuitable for thin layers avoiding undesirable heating induced effects. We\nfurther focus on the low frequency Raman mode corresponding to the rigid\nshearing oscillation between adjacent layers, found to be equal to 52.5 cm-1 in\nbulk hBN. For hBN sheets with thicknesses below typically 4 nm, the frequency\nof this mode presents discrete values, which are found to decrease down to\n46.0(5) cm-1 for a three-layer hBN, in good agreement with the linear-chain\nmodel. This makes Raman spectroscopy a relevant tool to quantitatively\ndetermine the number of layers in ultra thin hBN sheets, below 8L.\n", "  The demand for faster magnetization switching speeds and lower energy\nconsumption has driven the field of spintronics in recent years. The magnetic\ntunnel junction is the most developed spintronic memory device in which the\nmagnetization of the storage layer is switched by spin-transfer-torque or\nspin-orbit torque interactions. Whereas these novel spin-torque interactions\nexemplify the potential of electron-spin-based devices and memory, the\nswitching speed is limited to the ns regime by the precessional motion of the\nmagnetization. All-optical magnetization switching, based on the inverse\nFaraday effect, has been shown to be an attractive method for achieving\nmagnetization switching at ps speeds. Successful magnetization reversal in thin\nfilms has been demonstrated by using circularly polarized light. However, a\nmethod for all-optical switching of on-chip nanomagnets in high density memory\nmodules has not been described. In this work we propose to use plasmonics, with\nCMOS compatible plasmonic materials, to achieve on-chip magnetization reversal\nin nanomagnets. Plasmonics allows light to be confined in dimensions much\nsmaller than the diffraction limit of light. This in turn, yields higher\nlocalized electromagnetic field intensities. In this work, through simulations,\nwe show that using localized surface plasmon resonances, it is possible to\ncouple light to nanomagnets and achieve significantly higher opto-magnetic\nfield values in comparison to free space light excitation.\n", "  We derive out naturally some important distributions such as high order\nnormal distributions and high order exponent distributions and the Gamma\ndistribution from a geometrical way. Further, we obtain the exact mean-values\nof integral form functionals in the balls of continuous functions space with\n$p-$norm, and show the complete concentration of measure phenomenon which means\nthat a functional takes its average on a ball with probability 1, from which we\nhave nonlinear exchange formula of expectation.\n", "  We systematically investigated the superstructure evolution of Te atoms on\nAu(111) substrate at different coverages. As revealed by low temperature\nscanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, Te atoms form one-dimensional\nroot3 R30{\\deg} chains near 0.10 monolayer (ML). Two two-dimensional chiral\nstructures, (root111*root111)R4.7{\\deg} and (3root21*3root21)R10.9{\\deg}, can\nbe formed and their stability can be tuned by slightly adjusting the Te coverge\nnear 1/3 ML. A honeycomb-like superstructure is observed by further increasing\nthe coverage to 4/9 ML. An interfacial state emerges at ~-0.65 eV due to Te\nadsorption on Au(111). The formation of these Te-induced high-order\nsuperstructures is accompanied by relaxation of gold atoms in the surface\nlayer, indicating the strong Te-Au interaction.\n", "  The non-linear parameters of spin-torque oscillators based on a synthetic\nferrimagnet free layer (two coupled layers) are computed. The analytical\nexpressions are compared to macrospin simulations in the case of a synthetic\nferrimagnet excited by a current spin-polarized by an external fixed layer. It\nis shown that, of the two linear modes, acoustic and optical, only one is\nexcited at a time, and therefore the self-sustained oscillations are similar to\nthe dynamics of a single layer. However, the non-linear parameters values can\nbe controlled by the parameters of the synthetic ferrimagnet. With a strong\ncoupling between the two layers and asymmetric layers (different thicknesses),\nit is demonstrated that the non-linear frequency shift can be reduced, which\nresults in the reduction of the linewidth of the power spectral density. For a\nparticular applied field, the non-linear parameter can even vanish; this\ncorresponds to a transition between a red-shift and a blue-shift frequency\ndependence on the current and a linewidth reduction to the linear linewidth\nvalue.\n", "  Chimera states, which consist of coexisting domains of spatially coherent and\nincoherent dynamics, have been widely found in nonlocally coupled oscillatory\nsystems. We demonstrate for the first time that chimera states can emerge from\nexcitable systems under nonlocal coupling in which isolated units only allow\nfor the equilibrium. We theoretically reveal that nonlocal coupling induced\ncollective oscillation is behind the occurrence of the chimera states. We find\ntwo different types of chimera states, phase-chimera state and\nexcitability-chimera states, depending on the coupling strength. At weak\ncoupling strength where collective oscillation is localized around the unstable\nhomogeneous equilibrium, the chimera states are similar to the ones in\nnonlocally coupled phase oscillators. For the chimera states at strong coupling\nstrength, the dynamics of both coherent units and incoherent units shift back\nand forth between low amplitude oscillation induced by collective oscillation\nand high amplitude oscillation induced by excitability of local units.\n", "  In a recent paper [arXiv:1703.11003] on this journal Stephen Boughn argued\nthat quantum mechanics does not require nonlocality of any kind and that the\ncommon interpretation of Bell theorem as a nonlocality result is based on a\nmisunderstanding. In this note I argue that the Boughn arguments, that\nsummarize views widespread in certain areas of the foundations of quantum\nmechanics, are based on an incorrect reading of the presuppositions of the EPR\nargument and the Bell theorem and, as a consequence, are totally unfounded.\n", "  The optical memory effect is a well-known type of wave correlation that is\nobserved in coherent fields that scatter through thin and diffusive materials,\nlike biological tissue. It is a fundamental physical property of scattering\nmedia that can be harnessed for deep-tissue microscopy or 'through-the-wall'\nimaging applications. Here we show that the optical memory effect is a special\ncase of a far more general class of wave correlation. Our new theoretical\nframework explains how waves remain correlated over both space and angle when\nthey are jointly shifted and tilted inside scattering media of arbitrary\ngeometry. We experimentally demonstrate the existence of such coupled\ncorrelations and describe how they can be used to optimize the scanning range\nin adaptive optics microscopes.\n", "  We report on a theoretical analysis of the phase-shift in compact atomic\nclocks working either with cold or thermal atoms. It is well known that in a\nmicrowave cavity with electromagnetic losses, a traveling wave adds to the\nstanding wave of a given resonant mode. We calculate the spatial varying phase\nrelated to this travelling wave for two geometries of interest in clock\napplications, the cylindrical cavity and the spherical cavity. Due to their\nmotion, the atoms probe different regions of the cavity and then experience\ndifferent phases of the interrogating microwave field. We show that this\ncombination of atomic motion and spatial changing phase results in a\nphase-shift of the clock frequency, well known in primary frequency standards,\nthat can affect the metrological performances also of vapor cell and compact\ncold-atom clocks. In the latter case, we evaluate the phase-shift for a space\nclock and a ground clock.\n", "  Un-gated thermionic cathode RF guns are well known as a robust source of\nelectrons for many accelerator applications. These sources are in principle\nscalable to high currents without degradation of the transverse emittance due\nto control grids but they are also known for being limited by back-bombardment.\nWhile back-bombardment presents a significant limitation, there is still a lack\nof general understanding on how emission over the whole RF period will affect\nthe nature of the beams produced from these guns. In order to improve our\nunderstanding of how these guns can be used in general we develop analytical\nmodels that predict the transmission efficiency as a function of the design\nparameters, study how bunch compression and emission enhancement caused by\nSchottky barrier lowering affect the output current profile in the gun, and\nstudy the onset of space-charge limited effects and the resultant virtual\ncathode formation leading to a modulation in the output current distribution.\n", "  We present a new method to study harmonic waves in the low ionosphere (60 -\n90 km) by detecting their effects on reflection of very low frequency (VLF)\nradio waves. Our procedure is based on amplitude analysis of reflected VLF\nradio waves recorded in real time, which yields an insight into the dynamics of\nthe ionosphere at heights where VLF radio waves are being reflected. The method\nwas applied to perturbations induced by the solar terminator motions at\nsunrises and sunsets. The obtained results show that typical perturbation\nfrequencies found to exist in higher regions of the atmosphere are also present\nin the lower ionosphere, which indicates a global nature of the considered\noscillations. In our model atmosphere, they turn out to be the acoustic and\ngravity waves with comparatively short and long periods, respectively.\n", "  In this paper we consider an acoustic problem of wave propagation through a\ndiscontinuous medium. The problem is reduced to the dissipative wave equation\nwith distributional dissipation. We show that this problem has a so-called very\nweak solution, we analyse its properties and illustrate the theoretical results\nthrough some numerical simulations by approximating the solutions to the full\ndissipative model for a particular synthetic piecewise continuous medium. In\nparticular, we discover numerically a very interesting phenomenon of the\nappearance of a new wave at the singular point. For the acoustic problem this\ncan be interpreted as an echo effect at the discontinuity interface of the\nmedium.\n", "  As the interface between human and machine becomes blurred, hydrogel\nincorporated electronics and devices have emerged to be a new class of\nflexible/stretchable electronic and ionic devices due to their extraordinary\nproperties, such as soft, mechanically robust and biocompatible. However, heat\ndissipation in these devices could be a critical issue and remains unexplored.\nHere, we report the experimental measurements and equilibrium molecular dynamic\n(EMD) simulations of thermal conduction in polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels at\nroom temperature. The thermal conductivity of the PAAm hydrogels can be\nmodulated from 0.33 to 0.51 Wm-1K-1 by changing the crosslinking density. The\ncrosslinking density dependent thermal conductivity in hydrogels is explained\nby the competition between the increased conduction pathways and the enhanced\nphonon scattering effect. The assumption is further supported by both the\nequilibrium swelling ratio measurement and molecular simulation of hydrogels.\nOur study offers fundamental understanding of thermal transport in soft\nmaterials and provides design guidance for hydrogel-based devices.\n", "  The Wightman function i.e. vacuum two-point function, for a massless free\nscalar field in Fock quantization is inversely proportional to the invariant\ndistance squared between the corresponding spacetime points. Naturally it\ndiverges when these two points are taken to be infinitesimally close to each\nother. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show that\nthe Wightman function is bounded from above in polymer quantization of scalar\nfield. The bounded value of the Wightman function is governed by the polymer\nscale and its bounded nature can be viewed as if the spacetime has a zero-point\nlength. This emergence of effective discreteness in spacetime appears from\npolymer quantization of matter field alone as the geometry is treated\nclassically. It also demonstrates that the polymer quantization of matter field\nitself can capture certain aspects of the effective discrete geometry. We\ndiscuss the implications of the result on the response function of a\nUnruh-DeWitt detector that depends on the properties of the Wightman function.\n", "  We consider stable mass transfer from the secondary to the primary of an\nextreme mass ratio binary system. We show that when the mass transfer is\nsufficiently fast, mass leakage occurs through the outer Lagrange point L2, in\naddition to the usual transfer through L1. We provide an analytical estimate\nfor the mass leakage rate through L2 and find the conditions in which it is\ncomparable to the mass transfer rate through L1. Focusing on a binary system of\na main-sequence star and a super-massive black hole, driven by the emission of\ngravitational radiation, we show that it may sustain stable mass transfer,\nalong with mass loss through L2. If such a mass-transferring system occurs at\nour Galactic Centre, it produces a gravitational wave signal detectable by\nfuture detectors, such as eLISA. The signal evolves according to the star's\nadiabatic index and cooling time. For low mass stars, the evolution is faster\nthan the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling rate driving the star out of the\nmain-sequence. In some cases, the frequency and amplitude of the signal may\nboth decrease with time, contrary to the standard chirp of a coalescing binary.\nMass loss through L2, when occurs, decreases the evolution timescale of the\nemitted gravitational wave signal by up to a few tens of per cent. We conclude\nthat L2 mass ejection is a crucial factor in analyzing gravitational waves\nsignals produced by such systems.\n", "  The Riemann-Hilbert correspondence is an isomorphism between the de Rham\nmoduli space and the Betti moduli space, defined by associating to each\nFuchsian system its monodromy representation class. In 1997 Hitchin proved that\nthis map is a symplectomorphism. In this paper, we address the question of what\nhappens to this theory if we extend the de Rham moduli space by allowing\nconnections with higher order poles. In our previous paper arXiv:1511.03851,\nbased on the idea of interpreting higher order poles in the connection as\nboundary components with bordered cusps (vertices of ideal triangles in the\nPoincar\\'e metric) on the Riemann surface, we introduced the notion of\ndecorated character variety to generalize the Betti moduli space. This\ndecorated character variety is the quotient of the space of representations of\nthe fundamental groupid of arcs by a product of unipotent Borel sub-groups (one\nper bordered cusp). Here we prove that this representation space is endowed\nwith a Poisson structure induced by the Fock--Rosly bracket and show that the\nquotient by unipotent Borel subgroups giving rise to the decorated character\nvariety is a Poisson reduction. We deal with the Poisson bracket and its\nquantization simultaneously, thus providing a quantisation of the decorated\ncharacter variety. In the case of dimension 2, we also endow the representation\nspace with explicit Darboux coordinates. We conclude with a conjecture on the\nextended Riemann-Hilbert correspondence in the case of higher order poles.\n", "  The topological non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory with a boundary is shown to\nrequire a scalar field companion in order to preserve overall gauge-invariance\nboth in the 3 dimensional manifold, as well as on its boundary. This scalar\nfield, originally being a pure-gauge Chern-Simons excitation that indicates the\nmost general topological gauge structure in the bulk, is found to be crucial\nfor dynamic scalar excitation on the 2 dimensional generic boundary manifold,\nthe latter naturally representing a conformal mode. This gauge/CFT\ncorrespondence is general, for a compact gauge group.\n", "  We start with reviewing the origin of the idea that entropy and the Second\nLaw are associated with the Arrow of Time. We then introduced a new definition\nof entropy based on Shannons Measure of Information, SMI. The SMI may be\ndefined on any probability distribution, and therefore it is a very general\nconcept. On the other hand entropy is defined on a very special set of\nprobability distributions. More specifically the entropy of a thermodynamic\nsystem is related the probability distribution of locations and velocities or\nmomenta of all the particles, which maximized the Shannon Measure of\nInformation. As such, entropy is not a function of time. We also show that the\nH function, as defined by Boltzmann is an SMI but not entropy. Therefore, while\nthe H-function, as an SMI may change with time, Entropy, as a limit of the SMI\ndoes not change with time.\n", "  Using spin polarized density functional theory (DFT) based calculations,\ncombined with ab-initio molecular dynamics simulation, we carry out a\nsystematic investigation of the bimetallic Ni$_{13-n}$Ag$_n$ nano clusters, for\nall compositions. This includes prediction of the geometry, mixing behavior,\nand electronic properties. Our study reveals a tendency towards formation of a\ncore-shell like structures, following the rule of putting Ni in high\ncoordination site and Ag in low coordination site. Our calculations predict\nnegative mixing energies for the entire composition range, indicating mixing to\nbe favored for the bimetallic small sized Ni-Ag clusters, irrespective of the\ncompositions. The magic composition with the highest stability is found for the\nNiAg$_{12}$ alloy cluster. We investigate the microscopic origin of core-shell\nlike structure with negative mixing energy, in which the Ni-Ag inter-facial\ninteraction is found to play role. We also study the magnetic properties of the\nNi-Ag alloy clusters. The Ni dominated magnetism, consists of parallel\nalignment of Ni moments while the tiny moments on Ag align in anti-parallel to\nNi moments. The hybridization with Ag environment causes reduction of Ni\nmoment.\n", "  We study random unitary channels which reproduce the action of the twirling\nchannel corresponding to the representation of the symmetric groupon an n-fold\ntensor product. We derive upper andlower bounds on the randomness cost of\nimplementing such a map which depend exponentially on the number of systems.\nConsequently, symmetrictwirling can be regarded as a reasonable Shannon\ntheoretic protocol. On the other hand, such protocols are disqualified by their\nresource-inefficiency in situations where randomness is a costly resource.\n", "  Quantum network coding on the butterfly network has been studied as a typical\nexample of quantum multiple cast network. We propose secure quantum network\ncoding on the butterfly network in the multiple unicast setting based on a\nsecure classical network coding. This protocol certainly transmits quantum\nstates when there is no attack. We also show the secrecy even when the\neavesdropper wiretaps one of the channels in the butterfly network.\n", "  We propose a protocol which utilises radio frequency magnetic pulses in order\nto tune the effective two-particle scattering amplitudes for alkali atoms in\nthe $F=1$ hyperfine ground state. Unlike the Feshbach resonance method, the\nproposed protocol preserves with controllable accuracy the global rotational\nsymmetry in the spin space offering access to a broad region of the phase\ndiagram of the rotationally-symmetric spinor Bose condensate. Examples of\n$^{41}$K and $^{7}$Li are considered and it is shown that for these atoms\nsufficient variation in the effective coupling constants can be achieved in\norder to explore phase transitions between different symmetry-broken phases of\nthe condensate.\n", "  This editorial from the PASP Special Focus Issue \"Techniques and Methods for\nAstrophysical Data Visualization\" summarizes contributions from authors, their\nsoftware and tutorials, video abstracts, and 3D content. PASP and IOP have made\nthis Focus Issue an ongoing project and will continue accepting submissions\nthroughout 2017.

For these values of $n$, electric-dipole transitions between\nthe Rydberg states that evolve adiabatically to the $|ns\\rangle$ and\n$|np\\rangle$ states in zero electric field can be tuned into resonance with the\nground-state inversion transitions in NH$_3$ using electric fields, with energy\ntransfer occurring via F\\\"orster resonance. In the experiments the Rydberg He\natoms, traveling in pulsed supersonic beams, were prepared by resonant\ntwo-photon excitation from the metastable $1s2s\\,^3S_1$ level and crossed an\neffusive beam of NH$_3$ before being detected by state-selective\npulsed-electric-field ionization. The resonant-energy-transfer process was\nidentified by monitoring changes in the ionization signal from the $|ns\\rangle$\nand $|np\\rangle$ Rydberg states for each value of $n$. The electric field\ndependence of the experimental data is in good agreement with the results of\ncalculations in which the resonant dipole-dipole coupling between the collision\npartners was accounted for.\n", "  Fermilab is committed to upgrading its accelerator complex towards the\nintensity frontier to pursue HEP research in the neutrino sector and beyond.\nThe upgrade has two steps: 1) the Proton Improvement Plan (PIP), which is\nunderway, has its primary goal to start providing 700 kW beam power on NOvA\ntarget by the end of 2017 and 2) the foreseen PIP-II will replace the existing\nLINAC, a 400 MeV injector to the Booster, by an 800 MeV superconducting LINAC\nby the middle of next decade, with output beam intensity from the Booster\nincreased significantly and the beam power on the NOvA target increased to <1.2\nMW. In any case, the Fermilab Booster is going to play a very significant role\nfor the next two decades. In this context, we have recently developed and\ncommissioned an innovative beam injection scheme for the Booster called \"early\ninjection scheme.\" This scheme is already in operation and has a potential to\nincrease the Booster beam intensity from the PIP design goal by a considerable\namount with a reduced beam emittance and beam loss. In this paper, we will\npresent results from our experience from the new scheme in operation, current\nstatus and future plans.\n", "  Superconductivity with an ultra low Tc $\\sim$ 0.5 mK was discovered recently\nin bismuth, a semimetal. To develop a model and scenario for Bi we begin with a\ncubic reference lattice, close to A7 (dimerized cubic) structure of Bi. Three\nvalence electrons hop among 6p$_x$, 6p$_y$ and 6p$_z$ orbitals and form\n\\textit{quasi one dimensional chains at half filling}. An interesting interplay\nfollows: i) Mott localization tendency in the chains, ii) metallization by\ninterchain hopping and iii) lattice dimerization by electron-phonon coupling.\nIn our proposal, a potential high Tc superconductivity from RVB mechanism is\nlost in the game. However some superconducting fluctuations survive. Tiny fermi\npockets seen in Bi are viewed as remnant \\textit{evanescent Bogoliubov quasi\nparticles} in an anomalous normal state. Multi band character admits\npossibility of PT violating \\textit{chiral singlet superconductivity}. Bi has a\nstrong spin orbit coupling; Kramers theorem protects our proposal for the bulk\nby replacing real spin by Kramer pair. Control of chain dimerization might\nresurrect high Tc superconductivity in Bi, Sb and As.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics simulations, we study computational self-assembly of\none-component three-dimensional dodecagonal (12-fold) quasicrystals in systems\nwith two-length-scale potentials. Existing criteria for three-dimensional\nquasicrystal formation are quite complicated and rather inconvenient for\nparticle simulations. So to localize numerically the quasicrystal phase, one\nshould usually simulate over a wide range of system parameters. We show how to\nuniversally localize the parameters values at which dodecagonal quasicrystal\norder may appear for a given particle system. For that purpose, we use a\ncriterion recently proposed for predicting decagonal quasicrystal formation in\none-component two-length-scale systems. The criterion is based on two\ndimensionless effective parameters describing the fluid structure which are\nextracted from radial distribution function. The proposed method allows\nreducing the time spent for searching the parameters favoring certain solid\nstructure for a given system. We show that the method works well for\ndodecagonal quasicrystals; this results is verified on four systems with\ndifferent potentials: Dzugutov potential, oscillating potential which mimics\nmetal interactions, repulsive shoulder potential describing effective\ninteraction for core/shell model of colloids and embedded-atom model potential\nfor aluminum. Our results suggest that mechanism of dodecagonal quasicrystal\nformation is universal for both metallic and soft-matter systems and it is\nbased on competition between interparticle scales.\n", "  We present mini-proceedings of the international workshop on \"Chiral Forces\nin Low Energy Nuclear Physics - the LENPIC Meeting\" held at the Jagiellonian\nUniversity, Krakow, Poland from February 10 to 11, 2017. The workshop focused\non the new generation of chiral forces with the semi-local regularization and\ntheir applications to few- and many-nucleon systems. Included short\ncontributions summarize talks given by E.Epelbaum, K.Hebeler, R.Roth, H.Witala,\nA.Calci, P.Reinert, J.P.Vary, H.Kamada, I.Ciepal, H.Krebs, H.Le, K.Topolnicki,\nK.Vobig and Yu.Volkotrub.\n"]}
