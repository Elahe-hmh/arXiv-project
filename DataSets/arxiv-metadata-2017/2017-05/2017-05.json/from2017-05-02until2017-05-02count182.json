The approach is based on a recursion method analysis\nof the Liouvillian. From this we derive the lifetime of a vibrational mode in\nterms of moments of the power spectrum of the Liouvillian as projected onto the\nrelevant subspace of phase space. In practical terms, the moments are evaluated\nas ensemble averages of well-defined operators, meaning that the entire\ncalculation is to be done with Monte Carlo. These insights should lead to\nsignificantly shorter calculations compared to current methods. A companion\npiece presents numerical results.\n", "  We study the effective parameters of QED near the decoupling temperature and\nshow that the QED perturbation theory works perfectly fine at temperatures,\nbelow the decoupling temperature. Temperature dependent selfmass of electron,\nat T=m gives two different values, if approached to the same overlapping point.\nIt ia shown that at $T=m$, change in thermal contribution of the electron\nselfmass is 1/3 of the low temperature value and 1/2 of the high temperature\nvalue. The difference of behavior measures the electron background\ncontributions at T=m. These electrons are emitted through beta decay. This rise\nin mass affects the QED parameters and change the electromagnetic properties of\nthe medium with temperature also. However, these contributions are ignorable\nnear the decoupling temperature.\n", "  These are lecture notes for a mini-course given at the Cornell Probability\nSummer School in July 2013. Topics include lozenge tilings of polygons and\ntheir representation theoretic interpretation, the (q,t)-deformation of those\nleading to the Macdonald processes, nearest neighbor dynamics on Macdonald\nprocesses, their limit to semi-discrete Brownian polymers, and large time\nasymptotic analysis of polymer's partition function.\n", "  Although the present paper looks upon the formal apparatus of quantum\nmechanics as a calculus of correlations, it goes beyond a purely operationalist\ninterpretation. Having established the consistency of the correlations with the\nexistence of their correlata (measurement outcomes), and having justified the\ndistinction between a domain in which outcome-indicating events occur and a\ndomain whose properties only exist if their existence is indicated by such\nevents, it explains the difference between the two domains as essentially the\ndifference between the manifested world and its manifestation. A single,\nintrinsically undifferentiated Being manifests the macroworld by entering into\nreflexive spatial relations. This atemporal process implies a new kind of\ncausality and sheds new light on the mysterious nonlocality of quantum\nmechanics. Unlike other realist interpretations, which proceed from an\nevolving-states formulation, the present interpretation proceeds from Feynman's\nformulation of the theory, and it introduces a new interpretive principle,\nreplacing the collapse postulate and the eigenvalue--eigenstate link of\nevolving-states formulations. Applied to alternatives involving distinctions\nbetween regions of space, this principle implies that the spatiotemporal\ndifferentiation of the physical world is incomplete. Applied to alternatives\ninvolving distinctions between things, it warrants the claim that,\nintrinsically, all fundamental particles are identical in the strong sense of\nnumerical identical. They are the aforementioned intrinsically undifferentiated\nBeing, which manifests the macroworld by entering into reflexive spatial\nrelations.\n", "  Ca2Co2O5 in the brownmillerite form was synthesized using a high-pressure\noptical-image floating zone furnace, and single crystals with dimensions up to\n1.4x0.8x0.5 mm3 were obtained. At room temperature, Ca2Co2O5 crystallizes as a\nfully ordered brownmillerite variant in the orthorhombic space group Pcmb (No.\n57) with unit cell parameters a=5.28960(10) {\\AA}, b=14.9240(2) {\\AA}, and\nc=10.9547(2) {\\AA}. With decreasing temperature, it undergoes a re-entrant\nsequence of first-order structural phase transitions (Pcmb to P2/c11 to P121/m1\nto Pcmb) that is unprecedented among brownmillerites, broadening the family of\nspace groups available to these materials and challenging current approaches\nfor sorting the myriad variants of brownmillerite structures. Magnetic\nsusceptibility data indicate antiferromagnetic ordering in Ca2Co2O5 occurs near\n240 K, corroborated by neutron powder diffraction. Below 140 K, the specimen\nexhibits a weak ferromagnetic component directed primarily along the b axis\nthat shows a pronounced thermal and magnetic history dependence.\n", "  We attempt to analyze a one-dimensional space-inhomogeneous quantum walk (QW)\nwith one defect at the origin, which has two different quantum coins in\npositive and negative parts. We call the QW \"the two-phase QW\", which we\ntreated concerning localization theorems [10]. The two-phase QW has been\nexpected to be a mathematical model of the topological insulator [16] which is\nan intense issue both theoretically and experimentally [3,5,11]. In this paper,\nwe derive the weak limit theorem describing the ballistic spreading, and as a\nresult, we obtain the mathematical expression of the whole picture of the\nasymptotic behavior. Our approach is based mainly on the generating function of\nthe weight of the passages. We emphasize that the time-averaged limit measure\nis symmetric for the origin [10], however, the weak limit measure is\nasymmetric, which implies that the weak limit theorem represents the asymmetry\nof the probability distribution.\n", "  Current understanding of correlations and quantum phase transitions in\nmany-body systems has significantly improved thanks to the recent intensive\nstudies of their entanglement properties. In contrast, much less is known about\nthe role of quantum non-locality in these systems. On the one hand, standard,\n\"theorist- and experimentalist-friendly\" many-body observables involve\ncorrelations among only few (one, two, rarely three...) particles. On the other\nhand, most of the available multipartite Bell inequalities involve correlations\namong many particles. Such correlations are notoriously hard to access\ntheoretically, and even harder experimentally. Typically, there is no Bell\ninequality for many-body systems built only from low-order correlation\nfunctions. Recently, however, it has been shown in [J. Tura et al., Science\n344, 1256 (2014)] that multipartite Bell inequalities constructed only from\ntwo-body correlation functions are strong enough to reveal non-locality in some\nmany-body states, in particular those relevant for nuclear and atomic physics.\nThe purpose of this lecture is to provide an overview of the problem of quantum\ncorrelations in many-body systems - from entanglement to nonlocality - and the\nmethods for their characterization.\n", "  The physical nature of a frequency shift of hydrogen valence vibrations in a\nwater molecule due to its interaction with neighbor molecules has been studied.\nElectrostatic forces connected with the multipole moments of molecules are\nsupposed to give a dominating contribution to the intermolecular interaction.\nThe frequency shift was calculated in the case where two neighbor molecules\nform a dimer. The obtained result is in qualitative agreement with the\nfrequency shifts observed for water vapor, hexagonal ice, and liquid water, as\nwell as for aqueous solutions of alcohols. This fact testifies to the\nelectrostatic nature of H-bonds used to describe both the specific features of\nthe intermolecular interaction in water and the macroscopic properties of the\nlatter.\n", "  Recently an antiferromagnetic metal phase has been proposed in double\nperovskites materials like Sr$_{2}$FeMoO$_{6}$ (SFMO), when electron doped.\nThis material has been found to change from half-metallic ferromagnet to\nantiferromagnetic metal (AFM) upon La-overdoping. The original proposition of\nsuch an AFM phase was made for clean samples, but the experimental realization\nof La-overdoped SFMO has been found to contain a substantial fraction of\nantisite defects. A phase segregation into alternate Fe and Mo rich regions was\nobserved. In this paper we propose a possible scenario in which this type of\nstrong antisite concentration can still result in an antiferromagnetic metal\nphase, by a novel hopping driven mechanism. Using variational calculations, we\nfind that proliferation of such phase segregated domain regions can also result\nin the stabilization of an A-type AFM over the G-type AFM based on kinetic\nenergy considerations.\n", "  A solid state mechanism for cooling high-current cables is proposed based on\nthe Ettingshausen effect, i.e. the transverse thermoelectric cooling generated\nin magnetic fields. The intense current running in the cable generates a strong\nmagnetic field around it, that can be exploited by a small current running in a\ncoating layer made out of a strong \"thermomagnetic\" material to induce a\ntemperature difference between the cable core and the environment. Both\nanalytical calculations and realistic numerical simulations for Bismuth\ncoatings in typical magnetic fields are presented. The latter yield temperature\ndrops ~60K and >100K for a single- and double-layer coating respectively. These\nencouraging results should stimulate the search for better thermomagnetic\nmaterials, in view of applications such as self-cooled superconducting cables\nworking at room temperature.\n", "  The speed of growth for a particular stochastic growth model introduced by\nBorodin and Ferrari in [Comm. Math. Phys. 325 (2014), 603-684], which belongs\nto the KPZ anisotropic universality class, was computed using multi-time\ncorrelations. The model was recently generalized by Toninelli in\n[arXiv:1503.05339] and for this generalization the stationary measure is known\nbut the time correlations are unknown. In this note, we obtain algebraic and\ncombinatorial proofs for the expression of the speed of growth from the\nprescribed dynamics.\n", "  In this contribution, the first results of HAWC, searching for VHE gamma-ray\nemission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) reported by $\\mathit{Swift}$, are\npresented. The HAWC gamma-ray observatory is operating in central Mexico at an\naltitude of 4,100 m above sea level. With an instantaneous field of view of\napproximately 2 sr and over 95% duty cycle (up time fraction), HAWC is an ideal\ndetector to perform ground-based gamma-ray observations of GRBs. Though\noptimised for TeV observations, HAWC has significant sensitivity to short\ntransients of energies as small as 50 GeV. The analysis method used for fast\nonline and offline HAWC follow up of GRBs reported by satellites is described.\n", "  The intriguing role of nematicity in iron-based superconductors, defined as\nbroken rotational symmetry below a characteristic temperature, is an intensely\ninvestigated contemporary subject. Nematicity is closely connected to the\nstructural transition, however, it is highly doubtful that the lattice degree\nof freedom is responsible for its formation, given the accumulating evidence\nfor the observed large anisotropy. Here we combine molecular beam epitaxy,\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy\ntogether to study the nematicity in multilayer FeSe films on SrTiO3. Our\nresults demonstrate direct connection between electronic anisotropy in momentum\nspace and standing waves in real space at atomic scale. The lifting of orbital\ndegeneracy of dxz/dyz bands gives rise to a pair of Dirac cone structures near\nthe zone corner, which causes energy-independent unidirectional interference\nfringes, observed in real space as standing waves by scattering electrons off\nC2 domain walls and Se-defects. On the other hand, the formation of C2 nematic\ndomain walls unexpectedly shows no correlation with lattice strain pattern,\nwhich is induced by the lattice mismatch between the film and substrate. Our\nresults establish a clean case that the nematicity is driven by electronic\nrather than lattice degrees of freedom in FeSe films.\n", "  Fault-tolerant quantum error correction is a necessity for any quantum\narchitecture destined to tackle interesting, large-scale problems. Its\ntheoretical formalism has been well founded for nearly two decades. However, we\nstill do not have an appropriate compiler to produce a fault-tolerant, error\ncorrected description from a higher level quantum circuit for state of the art\nhardware models. There are many technical hurdles, including dynamic circuit\nconstructions that occur when constructing fault-tolerant circuits with\ncommonly used error correcting codes. We introduce a package that converts high\nlevel quantum circuits consisting of commonly used gates into a form employing\nall decompositions and ancillary protocols needed for fault-tolerant error\ncorrection. We call this form the (I)initialisation, (C)NOT, (M)measurement\nform (ICM) and consists of an initialisation layer of qubits into one of four\ndistinct states, a massive, deterministic array of CNOT operations and a series\nof time ordered $X$- or $Z$-basis measurements. The form allows a more flexbile\napproach towards circuit optimisation. At the same time, the package outputs a\nstandard circuit or a canonical geometric description which is a necessity for\noperating current state-of-the-art hardware architectures using topological\nquantum codes.\n", "  Mandelbrot set is a closure of the set of zeroes of $resultant_x(F_n,F_m)$\nfor iterated maps $F_n(x)=f^{\\circ n}(x)-x$ in the moduli space of maps $f(x)$.\nThe wonderful fact is that for a given $n$ all zeroes are not chaotically\nscattered around the moduli space, but lie on smooth curves, with just a few\ncusps, located at zeroes of $discriminant_x(F_n)$. We call this phenomenon the\nMandelbrot property. If approached by the cabling method, symmetrically-colored\nHOMFLY polynomials $H^{\\cal K}_n(A|q)$ can be considered as linear forms on the\n$n$-th \"power\" of the knot ${\\cal K}$, and one can wonder if zeroes of\n$resultant_{q^2}(H_n,H_m)$ can also possess the Mandelbrot property. We present\nand discuss such resultant-zeroes patterns in the complex-$A$ plane. Though $A$\nis hardly an adequate parameter to describe the moduli space of knots, the\nMandelbrot-like structure is clearly seen -- in full accord with the vision of\narXiv:hep-th/0501235, that concrete slicing of the Universal Mandelbrot set is\nnot essential for revealing its structure.\n", "  Early dark energy (EDE) models are a class of quintessence dark energy with a\ndynamically evolving scalar field which display a small but non-negligible\namount of dark energy at the epoch of matter-radiation equality. Compared with\na cosmological constant, the presence of dark energy at early times changes the\ncosmic expansion history and consequently the shape of the linear theory power\nspectrum and potentially other observables. We constrain the cosmological\nparameters in the EDE cosmology using recent measurements of the cosmic\nmicrowave background and baryon acoustic oscillations. The best-fitting models\nfavour no EDE; here we consider extreme examples which are in mild tension with\ncurrent observations in order to explore the observational consequences of a\nmaximally allowed amount of EDE. We study the non-linear evolution of cosmic\nstructure in EDE cosmologies using large volume N-body simulations. Many\nlarge-scale structure statistics are found to be very similar between the\n$\\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) and EDE models. We find that the most\npromising way to distinguish EDE from $\\Lambda$CDM is to measure the power\nspectrum on large scales, where differences of up to 15% are expected.\n", "  We study the combined effect of interactions and disorder on topological\norder in one dimension. To this end we consider a generalized Kitaev chain\nincluding fermion-fermion interactions and disorder in the chemical potential.\nWe determine the phase diagram by performing density-matrix renormalization\ngroup calculations on the corresponding spin-1/2 chain. We find that moderate\ndisorder or repulsive interactions individually stabilize the topological\norder, which remains valid for their combined effect. However, both repulsive\nand attractive interactions lead to a suppression of the topological phase at\nstrong disorder.\n", "  The theory of symmetric functions has been extended to the case where each\nvariable is paired with an anticommuting one. The resulting expressions, dubbed\nsuperpolynomials, provide the natural N=1 supersymmetric version of the\nclassical bases of symmetric functions. Here we consider the case where two\nindependent anticommuting variables are attached to each ordinary variable. The\nN=2 super-version of the monomial, elementary, homogeneous symmetric functions,\nas well as the power sums, are then constructed systematically (using an\nexterior-differential formalism for the multiplicative bases), these functions\nbeing now indexed by a novel type of superpartitions. Moreover, the scalar\nproduct of power sums turns out to have a natural N=2 generalization which\npreserves the duality between the monomial and homogeneous bases. All these\nresults are then generalized to an arbitrary value of N. Finally, for N=2, the\nscalar product and the homogenous functions are shown to have a one-parameter\ndeformation, a result that prepares the ground for the yet-to-be-defined N=2\nJack superpolynomials.\n", "  We revisit a class of Z' explanations of the anomalies found by the LHCb\ncollaboration in $B$ decays, and show that the scenario is tightly constrained\nby a combination of constraints: (i) LHC searches for di-muon resonances, (ii)\npertubativity of the Z' couplings; (iii) the $B_s$ mass difference, and (iv)\nand electro-weak precision data. Solutions are found by suppressing the Z'\ncoupling to electrons and to light quarks and/or by allowing for a Z' decay\nwidth into dark matter. We also present a simplified framework where a\nTeV-scale Z' gauge boson that couples to standard leptons as well as to new\nheavy vector-like leptons, can simultaneously accommodate the LHCb anomalies\nand the muon g-2 anomaly.\n", "  A quantum computing system is typically represented by a set of\nnon-interacting (local) two-state systems - qubits. Many physical systems can\nnaturally have more accessible states, both local and non-local. We show that\nthe resulting non-local network of states connecting qubits can be efficiently\naddressed via continuous time quantum random walks, leading to substantial\nspeed-up of multiqubit entanglement manipulations. We discuss a three-qubit\nToffoli gate and a system of superconducting qubits as an illustration.\n", "  Non-local higher-energy auxiliary states have been successfully used to\nentangle pairs of qubits in different quantum computing systems. Typically a\nlonger-span non-local state or sequential application of few-qubit entangling\ngates are needed to produce a non-trivial multiqubit gate. In many cases a\nsingle non-local state that span over the entire system is difficult to use due\nto spectral crowding or impossible to have. At the same time, many multiqubit\nsystems can naturally develop a network of multiple non-local higher-energy\nstates that span over few qubits each. We show that continuous time quantum\nwalks can be used to address this problem by involving multiple such states to\nperform local and entangling operations concurrently on many qubits. This\nintroduces an alternative approach to multiqubit gate compression based on\navailable physical resources. We formulate general requirements for such walks\nand discuss configurations of non-local auxiliary states that can emerge in\nquantum computing architectures based on self-assembled quantum dots, defects\nin diamond, and superconducting qubits, as examples. Specifically, we discuss a\nscalable multiqubit quantum register constructed as a single chain with\nnearest-neighbor interactions. We illustrate how quantum walks can be\nconfigured to perform single-, two- and three-qubit gates, including Hadamard,\nControl-NOT, and Toffoli gates. Continuous time quantum walks on graphs\ninvolved in these gates are investigated.\n", "  Large-scale digital quantum simulations require thousands of fundamental\nentangling gates to construct the simulated dynamics. Despite success in a\nvariety of small-scale simulations, quantum information processing platforms\nhave hitherto failed to demonstrate the combination of precise control and\nscalability required to systematically outmatch classical simulators. We\nanalyse how fast gates could enable trapped-ion quantum processors to achieve\nthe requisite scalability to outperform classical computers without error\ncorrection. We analyze the performance of a large-scale digital simulator, and\nfind that fidelity of around 70% is realizable for pi-pulse infidelities below\n$10^{-5}$ in traps subject to realistic rates of heating and dephasing. This\nscalability relies on fast gates: entangling gates faster than the trap period.\n", "  The elastic $\\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering at low energies is studied employing\nan effective field theory in which the $\\alpha$ and $^{12}$C states are treated\nas elementary-like fields. We discuss scales of the theory at stellar energy\nregion that the ${}^{12}$C($\\alpha$, $\\gamma$)$^{16}$O process occurs, and then\nobtain an expression of the elastic scattering amplitudes in terms of effective\nrange parameters. Using experimental data of the phase shifts for $l=0,1,2$\nchannels at low energies, for which the resonance regions are avoided, we fix\nvalues of the parameters and find that the phase shifts at the low energies are\nwell reproduced by using three effective range parameters for each channel.\nFurthermore, we discuss problems and uncertainties of the present approach when\nthe amplitudes are extrapolated to the stellar energy region.\n", "  The magnetic and nematic properties of the iron chalcogenides have recently\nbeen the subject of intense interest. Motivated by the proposed\nantiferroquadrupolar and Ising-nematic orders for the bulk FeSe, we study the\nphase diagram of an $S=1$ generalized bilinear-biquadratic model with\nmulti-neighbor interactions. We find a large parameter regime for a ($\\pi$,0)\nantiferroquadrupolar phase, showing how quantum fluctuations stabilize it by\nlifting an infinite degeneracy of certain semiclassical states. Evidence for\nthis C$_4$-symmetry-breaking quadrupolar phase is also provided by an unbiased\ndensity matrix renormalization group analysis. We discuss the implications of\nour results for FeSe and related iron-based superconductors.\n", "  The observed stellar kinematics of dispersion-supported galaxies are often\nused to measure dynamical masses. Recently, several analytical relationships\nbetween the stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion, the projected (2D) or\ndeprojected (3D) half-light radius, and the total mass enclosed within the\nhalf-light radius, relying on the spherical Jeans equation, have been proposed.\nHere, we make use of the APOSTLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the\nLocal Group to test the validity and accuracy of such mass estimators for both\ndispersion and rotation-supported galaxies, for field and satellite galaxies,\nand for galaxies of varying masses, shapes, and velocity dispersion\nanisotropies. We find that the mass estimators of Walker et al. and Wolf et al.\nare able to recover the masses of dispersion-dominated systems with little\nsystematic bias, but with a 1-sigma scatter of 25 and 23 percent, respectively.\nThe error on the estimated mass is dominated by the impact of the 3D shape of\nthe stellar mass distribution, which is difficult to constrain observationally.\nThis intrinsic scatter becomes the dominant source of uncertainty in the masses\nestimated for galaxies like the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Milky\nWay, where the observational errors in their sizes and velocity dispersions are\nsmall. Such scatter may also affect the inner density slopes of dSphs derived\nfrom multiple stellar populations, relaxing the significance with which\nNavarro-Frenk-White profiles may be excluded, depending on the degree to which\nthe relevant properties of the different stellar populations are correlated.\nFinally, we derive a new optimal mass estimator that removes the residual\nbiases and achieves a statistically significant reduction in the scatter to 20\npercent overall for dispersion-dominated galaxies, allowing more precise and\naccurate mass estimates.\n", "  Combining experiment and theory, we investigate how the naturally created\nheterojunction at a graphene and metallic contact is modulated via interaction\nwith molecular hydrogen (H2). Due to electrostatic interaction, a Cr/Au\nelectrode induces a pn junction in graphene, leading to an asymmetrical\nresistance between the charge carriers (electron and hole). This asymmetry is\nwell modeled by considering the preferential charge scattering at the pn\njunction, and we show that it can be modulated in a reversible, selective and\nasymmetrical manner by exposing H2 to the metal-graphene interface. Our results\nare valuable for understanding the nature of the metal-graphene interfaces and\ndemonstrate a novel route towards hydrogen sensor application. KEYWORDS:\ngraphene, contact resistance,\n", "  In this work we investigate the thermodynamic properties of conformal gravity\nin four dimensions. We compute the \\emph{area(or entropy) functional} relation\nfor this black hole. We consider both de-Sitter (dS) and anti de-Sitter (AdS)\ncases. We derive the \\emph{Cosmic-Censorship-Inequality} which is an important\nrelation in general relativity that relates the total mass of a spacetime to\nthe area of all the black hole horizons. Local thermodynamic stability is\nstudied by computing the specific heat. The second order phase transition\noccurs at a certain condition. Various type of second order phase structure has\nbeen given for various values of $a$ and the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ in\nthe Appendix. When $a=0$, one obtains the result of Schwarzschild-dS and\nSchwarzschild-AdS cases. In the limit $aM<<1$, one obtains the result of\nGrumiller space-time. Where $a$ is non-trivial Rindler parameter or Rindler\nacceleration and $M$ is the mass parameter. The \\emph{thermodynamic volume\nfunctional} relation is derived in the \\emph{extended phase space}, where the\ncosmological constant treated as a thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate\nvariable as a thermodynamic volume. The \\emph{mass-independent} area (or\nentropy) functional relation and thermodynamic volume functional relation that\nwe have derived could turn out to be a \\emph{universal} quantity.\n", "  This study is motivated by the previous work [14]. We treat 3 types of the\none-dimensional quantum walks (QWs), whose time evolutions are described by\ndiagonal unitary matrix, and diagonal unitary matrices with one defect. In this\npaper, we call the QW defined by diagonal unitary matrices, \"the diagonal QW\",\nand we consider the stationary distributions of generally 2-state diagonal QW\nwith one defect, 3-state space-homogeneous diagonal QW, and 3-state diagonal QW\nwith one defect. One of the purposes of our study is to characterize the QWs by\nthe stationary measure, which may lead to answer the basic and natural\nquestion, \"What the stationary measure is for one-dimensional QWs ?\". In order\nto analyze the stationary distribution, we focus on the corresponding\neigenvalue problems and the definition of the stationary measure.\n", "  A 2.5-3 sigma discrepancy has been reported between the baryonic acoustic\noscillation peak (BAO) in the Lyman $\\alpha$ forest at $z\\sim 2.34$ and the\nbest fit Planck $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. To isolate the origin of the tension,\nwe consider unanchored BAO, in which the standard BAO ruler is not calibrated,\neliminating any dependence on cosmology before redshift $z\\sim 2.34$. We\nconsider BOSS BAO measurements at $z\\sim 0.32$, 0.57 and 2.34, using the full\n2-dimensional constraints on the angular and line of sight BAO scale, as well\nas isotropic BAO measurements by 6dF and SDSS at $z\\sim 0.106$ and $z\\sim\n0.15$. We find that the $z>0.43$ data alone is in 2.9 sigma of tension with\n$\\Lambda$CDM with or without the Planck best fit values of the mass fraction\n$\\Omega_m$ and the BAO scale $r_d H_0$, indicating that the tension arises not\nfrom the $\\Lambda$CDM parameters but from the dark energy evolution itself at\n0.57<z<2.34. This conclusion is supported when the acoustic scale measured by\nthe CMB is included, which further increases the tension and excludes a\nsolution with a constant dark energy equation of state. Including the low $z$\nBAO data, which is itself consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM, reduces the tension to\njust over 2 sigma, however in this case a CPL parametrization of the dark\nenergy evolution yields only a modest improvement.\n", "  We examine the cosmological sector of a gauge theory of gravity based on the\nSO(4,2) conformal group of Minkowski space. We allow for conventional matter\ncoupled to the spacetime metric as well as matter coupled to the field that\ngauges special conformal transformations. An effective cosmological constant is\ngenerated dynamically via solution of the equations of motion, and this allows\nus to recover the late time acceleration of the universe. Furthermore,\ngravitational fields sourced by ordinary cosmological matter (i.e. dust and\nradiation) are significantly weakened in the very early universe, which has the\neffect of replacing the big bang with a big bounce. Finally, we find that this\nbounce is followed by a period of nearly-exponential slow roll inflation that\ncan last long enough to explain the large scale homogeneity of the cosmic\nmicrowave background.\n", "  Toeplitz matrices have entries that are constant along diagonals. They model\ndirected transport, are at the heart of correlation function calculations of\nthe two-dimensional Ising model, and have applications in quantum information\nscience. We derive their eigenvalues and eigenvectors when the symbol is\nsingular Fisher-Hartwig. We then add diagonal disorder and study the resulting\neigenpairs. We find that there is a \"bulk\" behavior that is well captured by\nsecond order perturbation theory of non-Hermitian matrices. The\nnon-perturbative behavior is classified into two classes: Runaways type I leave\nthe complex-valued spectrum and become completely real because of eigenvalue\nattraction. Runaways type II leave the bulk and move very rapidly in response\nto perturbations. These have high condition numbers and can be predicted.\nLocalization of the eigenvectors are then quantified using entropies and\ninverse participation ratios . Eigenvectors corresponding to Runaways type II\nare most localized (i.e., super-exponential), whereas Runaways type I are less\nlocalized than the unperturbed counterparts and have most of their probability\nmass in the interior with algebraic decays. The results are corroborated by\napplying free probability theory and various other supporting numerical\nstudies.\n", "  We present a scheme to perform an iterative variational optimization with\ninfinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS), a tensor network ansatz for a\ntwo-dimensional wave function in the thermodynamic limit, to compute the ground\nstate of a local Hamiltonian. The method is based on a systematic summation of\nHamiltonian contributions using the corner transfer-matrix method. Benchmark\nresults for challenging problems are presented, including the 2D Heisenberg\nmodel, the Shastry-Sutherland model, and the t-J model, which show that the\nvariational scheme yields considerably more accurate results than the\npreviously best imaginary time evolution algorithm, with a similar\ncomputational cost and with a faster convergence towards the ground state.\n", "  The semiclassical kinetic theory of Dirac particles in the presence of\nexternal electromagnetic fields and global rotation is established. To provide\nthe Hamiltonian formulation of Dirac particles a symplectic two-form which is a\nmatrix in spin indices is proposed. The particle number and current densities\nfor the Dirac particles are acquired in the helicity basis. Following a similar\nprocedure, semiclassical kinetic theory of the Weyl particles is accomplished.\nIt is shown that the phase-space dynamics of the Weyl and Dirac particles is\ndirectly linked. The anomalous chiral effects due to the external\nelectromagnetic fields and angular velocity of the frame are calculated.\n", "  We study partition functions of 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ U(N) gauge theories on\ncompact manifolds which are $S^1$ fibrations over $S^2$. We show that the\npartition functions are free field correlators of vertex operators and\nscreening charges of the $q$-Virasoro modular double, which we define. The\ninclusion of supersymmetric Wilson loops in arbitrary representations allows us\nto show that the generating functions of Wilson loop vacuum expectation values\nsatisfy two SL(2,$\\mathbb{Z}$)-related commuting sets of $q$-Virasoro\nconstraints. We generalize our construction to 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ unitary\nquiver gauge theories and as an example we give the free boson realization of\nthe ABJ(M) model.\n", "  CP violation in $B^0_s$-$\\bar B^0_s$ oscillations is expected at the\n$10^{-5}$ level in the Standard Model but could be enhanced by New Physics.\nUsing $B^0_s\\to D_s^-\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$ decays, LHCb has recently reported the new\nresult $(0.39\\pm0.33)\\times10^{-2}$ of the corresponding observable $a^s_{\\rm\nsl}$. We point out that other current $B$ decay data imply $a^s_{\\rm sl} =\n(0.004 \\pm 0.075)\\times10^{-2}$. In view of this strong constraint, we propose\nto use $B^0_s\\to D_s^-\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$ and similar flavor-specific decays as a\nnew tool to determine both the production asymmetry between $B^0_s$ and $\\bar\nB^0_s$ mesons, and the CP asymmetry in the subsequent $D^\\pm_s$ decays. The\nformer serves as input for analyses of CP violation in $B^0_s$ channels, with\nsignificant room for improvement, while the latter offers an exciting\nlaboratory for New Physics.\n", "  Thermodynamically, bosons and fermions differ by their statistics only. A\ngeneral entropy functional is proposed by superposition of entropic terms,\ntypical for different quantum gases. The statistical properties of the\ncorresponding Janus particles are derived by variation of the weight of the\nboson/fermion fraction. It is shown that di-bosons and anti-fermions separate\nin gas and liquid phases, while three-phase equilibrium appears for\npoly-boson/fermion Janus particles.\n", "  Photometric redshift uncertainties are a major source of systematic error for\nongoing and future photometric surveys. We study different sources of redshift\nerror caused by choosing a suboptimal redshift histogram bin width and propose\nmethods to resolve them. The selection of a too large bin width is shown to\noversmooth small scale structure of the radial distribution of galaxies. This\nsystematic error can significantly shift cosmological parameter constraints by\nup to $6 \\, \\sigma$ for the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$.\nCareful selection of bin width can reduce this systematic by a factor of up to\n6 as compared with commonly used current binning approaches. We further discuss\na generalised resampling method that can correct systematic and statistical\nerrors in cosmological parameter constraints caused by uncertainties in the\nredshift distribution. This can be achieved without any prior assumptions about\nthe shape of the distribution or the form of the redshift error. Our\nmethodology allows photometric surveys to obtain unbiased cosmological\nparameter constraints using a minimum number of spectroscopic calibration data.\nFor a DES-like galaxy clustering forecast we obtain unbiased results with\nrespect to errors caused by suboptimal histogram bin width selection, using\nonly 5k representative spectroscopic calibration objects per tomographic\nredshift bin.\n", "  The decay of spin-valley states is studied in a suspended carbon nanotube\ndouble quantum dot via leakage current in Pauli blockade and via dephasing and\ndecoherence of a qubit. From the magnetic field dependence of the leakage\ncurrent, hyperfine and spin-orbit contributions to relaxation from blocked to\nunblocked states are identified and explained quantitatively by means of a\nsimple model. The observed qubit dephasing rate is consistent with the\nhyperfine coupling strength extracted from this model and inconsistent with\ndephasing from charge noise. However, the qubit coherence time, although longer\nthan previously achieved, is probably still limited by charge noise in the\ndevice.\n", "  We present a method to show that low-energy states of quantum many-body\ninteracting systems in one spatial dimension are nonlocal. We assign a Bell\ninequality to the Hamiltonian of the system in a natural way and we efficiently\nfind its classical bound using dynamic programming. The Bell inequality is such\nthat its quantum value for a given state, and for appropriate observables,\ncorresponds to the energy of the state. Thus, the presence of nonlocal\ncorrelations can be certified for states of low enough energy. The method can\nalso be used to optimize certain Bell inequalities: in the translationally\ninvariant (TI) case, we provide an exponentially faster computation of the\nclassical bound and analytically closed expressions of the quantum value for\nappropriate observables and Hamiltonians. The power and generality of our\nmethod is illustrated through four representative examples: a tight TI\ninequality for 8 parties, a quasi TI uniparametric inequality for any even\nnumber of parties, ground states of spin-glass systems, and a non-integrable\ninteracting XXZ-like Hamiltonian. Our work opens the possibility for the use of\nlow-energy states of commonly studied Hamiltonians as multipartite resources\nfor quantum information protocols that require nonlocality.\n", "  In this work, we consider a generalization of quantum electrodynamics\nincluding Lorentz violation and torsional-gravity, in the context of general\nspinor fields as classified in the Lounesto scheme. Singular spinor fields will\nbe shown to be less sensitive to the Lorentz violation, as far as couplings\nbetween the spinor bilinear covariants and torsion are regarded. In addition,\nwe prove that flagpole spinor fields do not admit minimal coupling to the\ntorsion. In general, mass dimension four couplings are deeply affected when\nsingular flagpole spinors are considered, instead of the usual Dirac spinors.\nWe also construct a mapping between spinors in the covariant framework and\nspinors in Lorentz symmetry breaking scenarios, showing how one may\ntransliterate spinors of different classes between the two cases. Specific\nexamples concerning the mapping of Dirac spinor fields in Lorentz violating\nscenarios into flagpole and flag-dipole spinors with full Lorentz invariance\n(including the cases of Weyl and Majorana spinors) are worked out.\n", "  Using a combination of first-principles density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations and exact diagonalization studies of a first-principles derived\nmodel, we carry out a microscopic analysis of the magnetic properties of the\nhalf-metallic double perovskite compound, Sr$_2$CrMoO$_6$, a sister compound of\nthe much discussed material Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$. The electronic structure of\nSr$_2$CrMoO$_6$, though appears similar to Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$ at first glance,\nshows non trivial differences with that of Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$ on closer\nexamination. In this context, our study highlights the importance of charge\ntransfer energy between the two transition metal sites. The change in charge\ntransfer energy due to shift of Cr $d$ states in Sr$_2$CrMoO$_6$ compared to Fe\n$d$ in Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$ suppresses the hybridization between Cr $t_{2g}$ and Mo\n$t_{2g}$. This strongly weakens the hybridization-driven mechanism of magnetism\ndiscussed for Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$. Our study reveals that, nonetheless, the\nmagnetic transition temperature of Sr$_2$CrMoO$_6$ remains high since\nadditional superexchange contribution to magnetism arises with a finite\nintrinsic moment developed at the Mo site. We further discuss the situation in\ncomparison to another related double perovskite compound, Sr$_2$CrWO$_6$. We\nalso examine the effect of correlation beyond DFT, using dynamical mean field\ntheory (DMFT).\n", "  The onset of thermalization in a closed finite system of randomly interacting\nbosons, at the level of a single eigenstate, is discussed. The main interest is\nin the emergence of the Bose-Einstein distribution of single-particle\noccupation numbers, establishing a global and local criterion for\nthermalization. We show how to define the temperature of a given eigenstate,\nprovided that it has a chaotic structure in the basis defined by\nsingle-particle states. The analytical expression for the eigenstate\ntemperature as a function of the inter-particle interaction and energy is\ncomplemented by numerical data.\n", "  We propose a framework for the systematic and quantitative generalization of\nBell's theorem using causal networks. We first consider the multi-objective\noptimization problem of matching observed data while minimizing the causal\neffect of nonlocal variables and prove an inequality for the optimal region\nthat both strengthens and generalizes Bell's theorem. To solve the optimization\nproblem (rather than simply bound it), we develop a novel genetic algorithm\ntreating as individuals causal networks. By applying our algorithm to a\nphotonic Bell experiment, we demonstrate the trade-off between the quantitative\nrelaxation of one or more local causality assumptions and the ability of data\nto match quantum correlations.\n", "  Axion stars, gravitationally bound states of low-energy axion particles, have\na maximum mass allowed by gravitational stability. Weakly bound states\nobtaining this maximum mass have sufficiently large radii such that they are\ndilute, and as a result, they are well described by a leading-order expansion\nof the axion potential. Heavier states are susceptible to gravitational\ncollapse. Inclusion of higher-order interactions, present in the full\npotential, can give qualitatively different results in the analysis of\ncollapsing heavy states, as compared to the leading-order expansion. In this\nwork, we find that collapsing axion stars are stabilized by repulsive\ninteractions present in the full potential, providing evidence that such\nobjects do not form black holes. In the last moments of collapse, the binding\nenergy of the axion star grows rapidly, and we provide evidence that a large\namount of its energy is lost through rapid emission of relativistic axions.\n", "  We determine the discrete gauge symmetries that arise in F-theory\ncompactifications on examples of genus-one fibered Calabi-Yau 4-folds without a\nsection. We construct genus-one fibered Calabi-Yau 4-folds using Fano\nmanifolds, cyclic 3-fold covers of Fano 4-folds, and Segre embeddings of\nproducts of projective spaces. Discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_5$, $\\mathbb{Z}_4$,\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries arise in these constructions. We\nintroduce a general method to obtain multisections for several constructions of\ngenus-one fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds. The pullbacks of hyperplane classes\nunder certain projections represent multisections to these genus-one\nfibrations. We determine the degrees of these multisections by computing the\nintersection numbers with fiber classes. As a result, we deduce the discrete\ngauge symmetries that arise in F-theory compactifications. This method applies\nto various Calabi-Yau genus-one fibrations.\n", "  Describing finite-temperature nonequilibrium dynamics of interacting\nmany-particle systems is a notoriously challenging problem in quantum many-body\nphysics. Here we provide an exact solution to this problem for a system of\nstrongly interacting bosons in one dimension in the Tonks-Girardeau regime of\ninfinitely strong repulsive interactions. Using the Fredholm determinant\napproach and the Bose-Fermi mapping we show how the problem can be reduced to a\nsingle-particle basis, wherein the finite-temperature effects enter the\nsolution via an effective \"dressing\" of the single-particle wavefunctions by\nthe Fermi-Dirac occupation factors. We demonstrate the utility of our approach\nand its computational efficiency in two nontrivial out-of-equilibrium\nscenarios: collective breathing mode oscillations in a harmonic trap and\ncollisional dynamics in the Newton's cradle setting involving real-time\nevolution in a periodic Bragg potential.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a transmon qubit that is capacitively coupled to an\nopen multimode superconducting resonator. Our effective equations are derived\nby eliminating resonator degrees of freedom while encoding their effect in the\nGreen's function of the electromagnetic background. We account for the\ndissipation of the resonator exactly by employing a spectral representation for\nthe Green's function in terms of a set of non-Hermitian modes and show that it\nis possible to derive effective Heisenberg-Langevin equations without resorting\nto the rotating wave, two level or Markov approximations. A well-behaved time\ndomain perturbation theory is derived to systematically account for the\nnonlinearity of the transmon. We apply this method to the problem of\nspontaneous emission, capturing accurately the non-Markovian features of the\nqubit dynamics, valid for any qubit-resonator coupling strength.\n", "  We compute the entanglement and R\\'enyi entropy growth after a global quench\nin various dimensions in free scalar field theory. We study two types of\nquenches: a boundary state quench and a global mass quench. Both of these\nquenches are investigated for a strip geometry in 1, 2, and 3 spatial\ndimensions, and for a spherical geometry in 2 and 3 spatial dimensions. We\ncompare the numerical results for massless free scalars in these geometries\nwith the predictions of the analytical quasiparticle model based on EPR pairs,\nand find excellent agreement in the limit of large region sizes. At subleading\norder in the region size, we observe an anomalous logarithmic growth of\nentanglement coming from the zero mode of the scalar.\n", "  We consider a one-frequency, quasi-periodic, block Jacobi operator, whose\nblocks are generic matrix-valued analytic functions. We establish Anderson\nlocalization for this type of operator under the assumption that the coupling\nconstant is large enough but independent of the frequency. This generalizes a\nresult of J. Bourgain and S. Jitomirskaya on localization for band lattice,\nquasi-periodic Schroedinger operators.\n", "  One alternative to the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm is the scalar field\ndark matter (SFDM) model, which assumes dark matter is a spin-0 ultra-light\nscalar field (SF) with a typical mass $m\\sim10^{-22}\\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ and\npositive self-interactions. Due to the ultra-light boson mass, the SFDM could\nform Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in the very early Universe, which are\ninterpreted as the dark matter haloes. Although cosmologically the model\nbehaves as CDM, they differ at small scales: SFDM naturally predicts fewer\nsatellite haloes, cores in dwarf galaxies and the formation of massive galaxies\nat high redshifts. The ground state (or BEC) solution at zero temperature\nsuffices to describe low-mass galaxies but fails for larger systems. A possible\nsolution is adding finite-temperature corrections to the SF potential which\nallows combinations of excited states. In this work, we test the\nfinite-temperature multistate SFDM solution at galaxy cluster scales and\ncompare our results with the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and BEC profiles. We\nachieve this by fitting the mass distribution of 13 \\textit{Chandra} X-ray\nclusters of galaxies, excluding the region of the brightest cluster galaxy. We\nshow that the SFDM model accurately describes the clusters' DM mass\ndistributions offering an equivalent or better agreement than the NFW profile.\nThe complete disagreement of the BEC model with the data is also shown. We\nconclude that the theoretically motivated multistate SFDM profile is an\ninteresting alternative to empirical profiles and ad hoc fitting-functions that\nattempt to couple the asymptotic NFW decline with the inner core in SFDM.\n", "  Since its first isolation in 2004, graphene has been found to host a plethora\nof unusual electronic transport phenomena, making it a fascinating system for\nfundamental studies in condensed-matter physics as well as offering tremendous\nopportunities for future electronic and sensing devices. However, to fully\nrealise these goals a major challenge is the ability to non-invasively image\ncharge currents in monolayer graphene structures and devices. Typically,\nelectronic transport in graphene has been investigated via resistivity\nmeasurements, however, such measurements are generally blind to spatial\ninformation critical to observing and studying landmark transport phenomena\nsuch as electron guiding and focusing, topological currents and viscous\nelectron backflow in real space, and in realistic imperfect devices. Here we\nbring quantum imaging to bear on the problem and demonstrate high-resolution\nimaging of current flow in graphene structures. Our method utilises an\nengineered array of near-surface, atomic-sized quantum sensors in diamond, to\nmap the vector magnetic field and reconstruct the vector current density over\ngraphene geometries of varying complexity, from mono-ribbons to junctions, with\nspatial resolution at the diffraction limit and a projected sensitivity to\ncurrents as small as 1 {\\mu}A. The measured current maps reveal strong spatial\nvariations corresponding to physical defects at the sub-{\\mu}m scale. The\ndemonstrated method opens up an important new avenue to investigate fundamental\nelectronic and spin transport in graphene structures and devices, and more\ngenerally in emerging two-dimensional materials and thin film systems.\n", "  We describe an open-source implementation of the continuous-time\nhybridization-expansion quantum Monte Carlo method for impurity models with\ngeneral instantaneous two-body interactions and complex hybridization\nfunctions. The code is built on the ALPS libraries (Applications and Libraries\nfor Physics Simulations).\n", "  We revisit Walds analysis in the context of spin-one fields in three\ndimensions. A key technical difference from Walds is the role played by the\nthree dimensional completely antisymmetric tensor. We show how this changes the\nanalysis as well as the result.\n", "  We present a simple method to accurately infer line of sight (LOS) integrated\nlensing effects for galaxy scale strong lens systems through image\nreconstruction. Our approach enables us to separate weak lensing LOS effects\nfrom the main strong lens deflector. We test our method using mock data and\nshow that strong lens systems can be accurate probes of cosmic shear with a\nprecision on the shear terms of $\\pm 0.003$ (statistical error) for an HST-like\ndataset. We apply our formalism to reconstruct the lens COSMOS 0038+4133 and\nits LOS. In addition, we estimate the LOS properties with a halo-rendering\nestimate based on the COSMOS field galaxies and a galaxy-halo connection. The\ntwo approaches are independent and complementary in their information content.\nWe find that when estimating the convergence at the strong lens system,\nperforming a joint analysis improves the measure by a factor of two compared to\na halo model only analysis. Furthermore the constraints of the strong lens\nreconstruction lead to tighter constraints on the halo masses of the LOS\ngalaxies. Joint constraints of multiple strong lens systems may add valuable\ninformation to the galaxy-halo connection and may allow independent weak\nlensing shear measurement calibrations.\n", "  I discuss how to impose causality on spin-foam models, separating forward and\nbackward propagation, turning a given triangulation to a 'causal set', and\ngiving asymptotically the exponential of the Regge action, not a cosine. I show\nthe equivalence of the prescriptions which have been proposed to achieve this.\nEssential to the argument is the closure condition for the 4-simplices, all\nmade of space-like tetrahedra.\n", "  Chemically or optically powered active matter plays an increasingly important\nrole in materials design but its computational potential has yet to be explored\nsystematically. The competition between energy consumption and dissipation\nimposes stringent physical constraints on the information transport in active\nflow networks, facilitating global optimization strategies that are not well\nunderstood. Here, we combine insights from recent microbial experiments with\nconcepts from lattice-field theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to\nintroduce a generic theoretical framework for active matter logic (AML).\nHighlighting conceptual differences with classical and quantum computation, we\ndemonstrate how the inherent non-locality of incompressible active flow\nnetworks can be utilized to construct universal logical operations, Fredkin\ngates and memory storage in SR latches through the synchronized\nself-organization of many individual network components. Our work lays the\nconceptual foundation for developing autonomous microfluidic transport devices\ndriven by bacterial fluids, active liquid crystals or chemically engineered\nmotile colloids.\n", "  I review the concept of a {\\em disorder operator}, introduced originally by\nKadanoff in the context of the two-dimensional Ising model. Disorder operators\nacquire an expectation value in the disordered phase of the classical spin\nsystem. This concept has had applications and implications to many areas of\nphysics ranging from quantum spin chains to gauge theories to topological\nphases of matter. In this paper I describe the role that disorder operators\nplay in our understanding of ordered, disordered and topological phases of\nmatter. The role of disorder operators, and their generalizations, and their\nconnection with dualities in different systems, as well as with Majorana\nfermions and parafermions, is discussed in detail. Their role in recent\nfermion-boson and boson-boson dualities is briefly discussed.\n", "  Spin-driven nematicity, or the breaking of the point-group symmetry of the\nlattice without long-range magnetic order, is clearly quite important in\niron-based superconductors. From a symmetry point of view, nematic order can be\ndescribed as a coherent locking of spin fluctuations in two interpenetrating\nN\\'eel sublattices with ensuing nearest-neighbor bond order and an absence of\nstatic magnetism. Here, we argue that the low-temperature state of the recently\ndiscovered superconductor BaTi$_2$Sb$_2$O is a strong candidate for a more\nexotic form of spin-driven nematic order, in which fluctuations occurring in\nfour N\\'eel sublattices promote both nearest- and next-nearest neighbor bond\norder. We develop a low-energy field theory of this state and show that it can\nhave, as a function of temperature, up to two separate bond-order phase\ntransitions -- namely, one that breaks rotation symmetry and one that breaks\nreflection and translation symmetries of the lattice. The resulting state has\nan orthorhombic lattice distortion, an intra-unit-cell charge density wave, and\nno long-range magnetic order, all consistent with reported measurements of the\nlow-temperature phase of BaTi$_2$Sb$_2$O. We then use density functional theory\ncalculations to extract exchange parameters to confirm that the model is\napplicable to BaTi$_2$Sb$_2$O.\n", "  Computationally, low-resolution coarse-grained models provide the most viable\nmeans for simulating the large length and time scales associated with\nmesoscopic phenomena. Moreover, since lyotropic phases in solution may contain\nhigh solvent to amphiphile ratio, implicit solvent models are appropriate for\nmany purposes. By modifying the well-known Gay-Berne potential with an imposed\nuni-directionality and a longer range, we have come to a simple single-site\nmodel amphiphile that can rapidly self-assemble to give diverse lyotropic\nphases without the explicit incorporation of solvent particles. The model\nrepresents a tuneable packing parameter that manifests in the spontaneous\ncurvature of amphiphile aggregates. Apart from large scale simulations (e.g.\nthe study of self-assembly, amphiphile mixing, domain formation etc.) this\nnovel, non-specific model may be useful for suggestive pilot projects with\nmodest computational resources. No such self-assembling, single-site amphiphile\nmodel has been reported previously in the literature to the best of our\nknowledge.\n", "  In this paper, dye sensitized solar cell based on nano dye molecule N3 are\ninvestigated by using density functional computations. The main focus is on the\nN3 dye molecule and corresponding complexes formed at the interface between\nelectrolyte and dye, during the regeneration process. The optimizaed geometry\nand electronic structure of the molecule and complexs are calculated by using\nthe pseudopotential as well as full-potential techniques. The absorption\nspectra of metalliferous dye molecule, N3, and its complexes are computed in\nthe framework of time dependent density functional theory. We determine the\nreaction path of dye regeneration by Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method. IR\nspectrum of the N3 dye molecule were also calculated. We found that complexes\nof N3 dye molecule and transition states formed in reactions, are magnetic.\n", "  Future data from galaxy redshift surveys, combined with high-resolutions maps\nof the cosmic microwave background, will enable measurements of the pairwise\nkinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal with unprecedented statistical\nsignificance. This signal probes the matter-velocity correlation function,\nscaled by the average optical depth ($\\tau$) of the galaxy groups and clusters\nin the sample, and is thus of fundamental importance for cosmology. However, in\norder to translate pairwise kSZ measurements into cosmological constraints,\nexternal constraints on $\\tau$ are necessary. In this work, we present a new\nmodel for the intra-cluster medium, which takes into account star-formation,\nfeedback, non-thermal pressure, and gas cooling. Our semi-analytic model is\ncomputationally efficient and can reproduce results of recent hydrodynamical\nsimulations of galaxy cluster formation. By calibrating the model using recent\nX-ray measurements of gas density profiles of clusters and $M_{\\mathrm{gas}}-M$\nrelations of groups and clusters, we show that the integrated $\\tau$ is\nconstrained to better than 6% (with a confidence level of 95%), which sets the\ntightest constraints on the external prior on the optical depth of groups and\nclusters reported in the literature to date. Our strong prior on $\\tau$ should\nsignificantly improve cosmological constraints derived from future pairwise kSZ\nmeasurements and shed new insights into the nature of dark energy, modified\ngravity, and neutrino mass.\n", "  A symmetry broken phase of a system with internal degrees of freedom often\nfeatures a complex order parameter, which generates a rich variety of\ntopological excitations and imposes topological constraints on their\ninteraction (topological influence); yet the very complexity of the order\nparameter makes it difficult to treat topological excitations and topological\ninfluence systematically. To overcome this problem, we develop a general method\nto calculate homotopy groups and derive decomposition formulas which express\nhomotopy groups of the order parameter manifold $G/H$ in terms of those of the\nsymmetry $G$ of a system and those of the remaining symmetry $H$ of the state.\nBy applying these formulas to general monopoles and three-dimensional\nskyrmions, we show that their textures are obtained through substitution of the\ncorresponding $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$-subalgebra for the $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$-spin. We\nalso show that a discrete symmetry of $H$ is necessary for the presence of\ntopological influence and find topological influence on a skyrmion\ncharacterized by a non-Abelian permutation group of three elements in the\nground state of an SU(3)-Heisenberg model.\n", "  In its simplest form, decoherence occurs when a quantum state is entangled\nwith a second state, but the results of measurements made on the second state\nare not accessible. As the second state has effectively \"measured\" the first,\nin this paper we argue that the quantum Fisher information is the relevant\nmetric for predicting and quantifying this kind of decoherence. The quantum\nFisher information is usually used to determine an upper bound on how precisely\nmeasurements on a state can be used to estimate a classical parameter, and as\nsuch it is an important resource. Quantum enhanced metrology aims to create\nnon-classical states with large quantum Fisher information and utilise them in\nprecision measurements. In the process of doing this it is possible for states\nto undergo decoherence, for instance atom-light interactions used to create\ncoherent superpositions of atomic states may result in atom-light entanglement.\nHighly non-classical states, such as spin-cat states (Schr\\\"odinger cat states\nconstructed from superpositions of collective spins) are shown to be highly\nsusceptible to this kind of decoherence. We also investigate the required field\noccupation of the second state, such that this decoherence is negligible.\n", "  We apply the modern technique of approximation of multivariate functions -\ntensor train cross approximation - to the problem of the description of\nphysical interactions between complex-shaped bodies in a context of\ncomputational nanomechanics. In this note we showcase one particular example -\nvan der Waals interactions between two cylindrical bodies - relevant to\nmodeling of carbon nanotube systems. The potential is viewed as a tensor\n(multidimensional table) which is represented in compact form with the help of\ntensor train decomposition. The described approach offers a universal solution\nfor the description of van der Waals interactions between complex-shaped\nnanostructures and can be used within the framework of such systems of\nmesoscale modeling as recently emerged mesoscopic distinct element method\n(MDEM).\n", "  We study the von Neumann and R\\'enyi entanglement entropy (EE) of\nscale-invariant theories defined on tori in 2+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions.\nWe focus on spatial bi-partitions of the torus into two cylinders, and allow\nfor twisted boundary conditions along the non-contractible cycles. Various\nanalytical and numerical results are obtained for the universal EE of the\nrelativistic boson and Dirac fermion conformal field theories (CFTs), and for\nthe fermionic quadratic band touching and the boson with $z=2$ Lifshitz\nscaling. The shape dependence of the EE clearly distinguishes these theories,\nalthough intriguing similarities are found in certain limits. We also study the\nevolution of the EE when a mass is introduced to detune the system from its\nscale-invariant point, by employing a renormalized EE that goes beyond a naive\nsubtraction of the area law. In certain cases we find non-monotonic behavior of\nthe torus EE under RG flow, which distinguishes it from the EE of a disk.\n", "  If neutrinos are Dirac fermions, certain new physics beyond the standard\nmodel should exist to account for the smallness of neutrino mass. With two\nadditional scalars and a heavy intermediate fermion, in this paper, we\nsystematically study the general mechanism that can natrally generate the tiny\nDirac neutrino mass at tree and in one-loop level. For tree level models, we\nfocus on natural ones, in which the additional scalars develop small vacuum\nexpectation values without fine-tuning. For one-loop level models, we explore\nthose having dark matter candidates under $Z_2^D$ symmetry. In both cases, we\nconcentrate on $SU(2)_L$ multiplet scalars no larger than quintuplet, and\nderive the complete sets of viable models. Phenomenologies, such as lepton\nflavor violation, leptogenesis, and LHC signatures are briefly discussed.\n", "  Standard big bang cosmology predicts a cosmic neutrino background at $T_\\nu\n\\simeq 1.95~$K. Given the current neutrino oscillation measurements, we know\nmost neutrinos move at large, but non-relativistic, velocities. Therefore, dark\nmatter haloes moving in the sea of primordial neutrinos form a neutrino wake\nbehind them, which would slow them down, due to the effect of {\\it dynamical\nfriction}. In this paper, we quantify this effect for realistic haloes, in the\ncontext of the halo model of structure formation, and show that it scales as\n$m_\\nu^4$ $\\times$ relative velocity, and monotonically grows with the halo\nmass. Galaxy redshift surveys can be sensitive to this effect (at $>3\\sigma$\nconfidence level, depending on survey properties, neutrino mass and hierarchy)\nthrough redshift space distortions (RSD) of distinct galaxy populations.\n", "  We study two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric nodal superconductors under\nZeeman field and clarify the field angle dependence of topological properties.\nIt has been shown that the nodal excitation acquires an excitation gap due to\nthe Zeeman field perpendicular to anti-symmetric spin-orbit coupling, and then\ngapful topological superconductivity is realized. We show that the system\nundergoes gapful-gapless transition against tilting of the field. The gapless\nphase remains to show a finite band gap and unusual Majorana edge states in\nbetween the bulk bands. The Majorana edge states naturally propagate in a same\ndirection between oppositely-oriented edges. We elucidate relations of such\nunidirectional Majorana edge states with chiral edge states in the gapful\ntopological superconducting phase and previously studied Majorana flat bands at\nzero Zeeman field. A compact formula of topological invariants characterizing\nthe edge states is given. The gapful-gapless topological phase transition and\nassociated evolution of Majorana states are demonstrated in a model for\n$D+p$-wave superconductivity. Experimental realization in recently fabricated\ncuprate heterostructures and heavy fermion thin films is discussed.\n", "  The new class of hybrid organic-inorganic semiconductor (HOIS) materials,\nbased on halide perovskites, is constantly being pursued for applications such\nas Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and solar cells, due to their momentous\noptoelectronic properties. In this work, we present a single layer LED that\noperates due to energy transfer effects as well as a simple, instant and low\ncost method for its fabrication. A LED device based on a mixture of zero\ndimensional (OD) (CH 3 NH 3 ) 4 PbI 6, two dimensional (2D) (F- C 6 H 4 CH 2 CH\n2 NH 2 ) 2 PbI 4 and three dimensional (3D) (CH 3 NH 3 )PbI 3 HOIS, is\npresented for the first time. The final composite material manifests simple,\nyet unique energy transfer optical effects, while its electroluminescence\nexhibits excitonic recombination bright yellow light, peaked at 592 nm. LED\ndevice fabricated under ambient air, readily functions at room temperature and\nlow voltages. As for the active layer, it exhibited substantial film continuity\nin any form of deposition. Finally, with appropriate mixtures, it is possible\nto create films containing phase changes that exhibit dual color emission, here\npresented as yellow-green.\n", "  We connect the theories of the deformation of elastic surfaces and phase\nsurfaces arising in the description of almost periodic patterns. In particular,\nwe show parallels between asymptotic expansions for the energy of elastic\nsurfaces in powers of the thickness $h$ and the free energy for almost periodic\npatterns expanded in powers of $\\epsilon$, the inverse aspect ratio of the\npattern field. For sheets as well as patterns, the resulting energy can be\nexpressed in terms of natural geometric invariants, the first and second\nfundamental forms of the elastic surface, respectively the phase surface. We\ndiscuss various results for these energies and also address some of the\noutstanding questions.\n  We extend previous work on point (in 2D) and loop (in 3D) disclinations and\nconnect their topological indices with the condensation of Gaussian curvature\nof the phase surface. Motivated by this connection with the charge and spin of\npattern quarks and leptons, we lay out an ambitious program to build a\nmulti-scale universe inspired by patterns in which the short (spatial and\ntemporal) scales are given by a nearly periodic microstructure and whose\nmacroscopic/slowly varying/averaged behaviors lead to a hierarchy of structures\nand features on much longer scales including analogues to quarks and leptons,\ndark matter, dark energy and inflationary cosmology. One of our new findings is\nan interpretation of dark matter as the energy density in a pattern field. The\nassociated gravitational forces naturally result in galactic rotation curves\nthat are consistent with observations, while simultaneously avoiding some of\nthe small-scale difficulties of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm in\ncosmology.\n", "  The chiral clock spin-glass model with q=5 states, with both competing\nferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic and left-right chiral frustrations, is studied\nin d=3 spatial dimensions by renormalization-group theory. The global phase\ndiagram is calculated in temperature, antiferromagnetic bond concentration p,\nrandom chirality strength, and right-chirality concentration c. The system has\na ferromagnetic phase, a multitude of different chiral phases, a chiral\nspin-glass phase, and a critical (algebraically) ordered phase. The\nferromagnetic and chiral phases accumulate at the disordered phase boundary and\nform a spectrum of devil's staircases, where different ordered phases\ncharacteristically intercede at all scales of phase-diagram space. Shallow and\ndeep reentrances of the disordered phase, bordered by fragments of regular and\ntemperature-inverted devil's staircases, are seen. The extremely rich phase\ndiagrams are presented as continuously and qualitatively changing videos.\n", "  We present a weakly coupled map lattice model for patterning that explores\nthe effects exerted by weakening the local dynamic rules on model biological\nand artificial networks composed of two-state building blocks (cells). To this\nend, we use two cellular automata models based on: (i) a smooth majority rule\n(model I) and (ii) a set of rules similar to those of Conway's Game of Life\n(model II). The normal and abnormal cell states evolve according with local\nrules that are modulated by a parameter $\\kappa$. This parameter quantifies the\neffective weakening of the prescribed rules due to the limited coupling of each\ncell to its neighborhood and can be experimentally controlled by appropriate\nexternal agents. The emergent spatio-temporal maps of single-cell states should\nbe of significance for positional information processes as well as for\nintercellular communication in tumorigenesis where the collective normalization\nof abnormal single-cell states by a predominantly normal neighborhood may be\ncrucial.\n", "  Attempts to reproduce theoretically the relatively small width,\n$\\Gamma_{d^{\\ast}}=80\\pm 10$ MeV, of the $I(J^P)=0(3^+)$ $d^{\\ast}$(2380)\ndibaryon resonance established by the WASA-at-COSY Collaboration are discussed.\nThe validity of associating the $d^{\\ast}$(2380) in quark-based models\nprimarily with a tightly bound $\\Delta\\Delta$ configuration is questioned. The\n$d^{\\ast}$(2380) width and decay branching ratios into $NN\\pi\\pi$, $NN\\pi$ and\n$NN$ final states are studied within the Gal-Garcilazo hadronic model in which\nthe $d^{\\ast}$(2380) is a $\\pi N\\Delta$ resonance embedded in the $NN\\pi\\pi$\ncontinuum some 80 MeV below the $\\Delta\\Delta$ threshold. In particular,\npredictions are made for the branching ratios of the unobserved yet\n$d^{\\ast}(2380)\\to NN\\pi$ decays which are suppressed in a\npurely-$\\Delta\\Delta$ dibaryon model. Comments are also made on a possible\nconnection of the ABC effect observed in the $pn\\to d^{\\ast}\\to d\\pi^0\\pi^0$\nresonance reaction to the $d^{\\ast}$(2380) dibaryon.\n", "  We describe the new version (v2.73y) of the code HFODD which solves the\nnuclear Skyrme Hartree-Fock or Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov problem by using\nthe Cartesian deformed harmonic-oscillator basis. In the new version, we have\nimplemented the following new features: (i) full proton-neutron mixing in the\nparticle-hole channel for Skyrme functionals, (ii) the Gogny force in both\nparticle-hole and particle-particle channels, (iii) linear multi-constraint\nmethod at finite temperature, (iv) fission toolkit including the constraint on\nthe number of particles in the neck between two fragments, calculation of the\ninteraction energy between fragments, and calculation of the nuclear and\nCoulomb energy of each fragment, (v) the new version 200d of the code HFBTHO,\ntogether with an enhanced interface between HFBTHO and HFODD, (vi) parallel\ncapabilities, significantly extended by adding several restart options for\nlarge-scale jobs, (vii) the Lipkin translational energy correction method with\npairing, (viii) higher-order Lipkin particle-number corrections, (ix) interface\nto a program plotting single-particle energies or Routhians, (x) strong-force\nisospin-symmetry-breaking terms, and (xi) the Augmented Lagrangian Method for\ncalculations with 3D constraints on angular momentum and isospin. Finally, an\nimportant bug related to the calculation of the entropy at finite temperature\nand several other little significant errors of the previous published version\nwere corrected.\n", "  The static electric polarization of a holographic field theory dual to the\nEinstein-Maxwell theory in the background of $AdS_4$ with a\nReissner-Nordst\\\"{o}m (AdS-RN) black hole is investigated. We prove that the\nholographic polarization is a meromorphic functions in complex momentum plane\nand locate analytically the asymptotic distribution of the poles along two\nstraight lines parallel to the imaginary axis for a large momentum magnitude.\nThe results are compared with the numerical result on Friedel-like poles of the\nsame holographic model reported in the literature and with the momentum\nsingularities of the one-loop polarization in weak-coupling spinor QED$_3$ and\nscalar QED$_3$ with the similarities and differences discussed.\n", "  This paper presents two methods to compute scale anomaly coefficients in\nconformal field theories (CFTs), such as the c anomaly in four dimensions, in\nterms of the CFT data. We first use Euclidean position space to show that the\nanomaly coefficient of a four-point function can be computed in the form of an\noperator product expansion (OPE), namely a weighted sum of OPE coefficients\nsquared. We compute the weights for scale anomalies associated with scalar\noperators and show that they are not positive. We then derive a different sum\nrule of the same form in Minkowski momentum space where the weights are\npositive. The positivity arises because the scale anomaly is the coefficient of\na logarithm in the momentum space four-point function. This logarithm also\ndetermines the dispersive part, which is a positive sum over states by the\noptical theorem. The momentum space sum rule may be invalidated by UV and/or IR\ndivergences, and we discuss the conditions under which these singularities are\nabsent. We present a detailed discussion of the formalism required to compute\nthe weights directly in Minkowski momentum space. A number of explicit checks\nare performed, including a complete example in an 8-dimensional free field\ntheory.\n", "  Complex Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) is introduced as a novel approach to\nphase retrieval enabled control of monochromatic light transmission through\nhighly scattering media. In a simple optical setup, a spatial light modulator\nis used to generate a random sequence of phase-modulated wavefronts, and the\nresulting intensity speckle patterns in the transmitted light are acquired on a\ncamera. The SDP algorithm allows computation of the complex transmission matrix\nof the system from this sequence of intensity-only measurements, without need\nfor a reference beam. Once the transmission matrix is determined, optimal\nwavefronts are computed that focus the incident beam to any position or\nsequence of positions on the far side of the scattering medium, without the\nneed for any subsequent measurements or wavefront shaping iterations. The\nnumber of measurements required and the degree of enhancement of the intensity\nat focus is determined by the number of pixels controlled by the spatial light\nmodulator.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of a one-dimensional balls-in-boxes (BIB) model\nthat has been proposed as an effective model for the spatial-volume dynamics of\n(2+1)-dimensional causal dynamical triangulations (CDT). The latter is a\nstatistical model of random geometries and a candidate for a nonperturbative\nformulation of quantum gravity, and it is known to have an interesting phase\ndiagram, in particular including a phase of extended geometry with classical\nproperties. Our results corroborate a previous analysis suggesting that a\nparticular type of potential is needed in the BIB model in order to reproduce\nthe droplet condensation typical of the extended phase of CDT. Since such a\npotential can be obtained by a minisuperspace reduction of a (2+1)-dimensional\ngravity theory of the Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz type, our result strengthens the link\nbetween CDT and Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity.\n", "  We study the excited $B$ mesons' contributions to the coupled-channel effects\nunder the framework of ${}^3P_0$ model for the bottomonium. Contrary to what\nhas been widely accepted, the contributions of $P$ wave $B$ mesons are\ngenerally the largest and this result is independent of the potential\nparameters to some extent. We also push the calculation beyond $B(1P)$ and\ncarefully analyze the contributions of $B(2S)$. A form factor is a key\ningredient to suppress the contributions of $B(2S)$ for low lying bottomonia.\nHowever, this suppression mechanism is not efficient for highly excited\nbottomonia such as $\\Upsilon(5S)$ and $\\Upsilon(6S)$. We give explanations why\nthis difficulty happens to ${}^3P_0$ model and suggest analyzing flux-tube\nbreaking model for the full calculation of coupled-channel effects.\n", "  A renormalization method that introduces an auxiliary field to represent a\nthree-body bound state is studied in a three-boson system with a triboson\nfield. A cutoff dependence in the three-boson system emerges as a limit cycle,\nand the cyclic singularity is renormalized by employing two methods: a standard\nmethod and the auxiliary field method. For each method, different sets of\ndiagrams are involved for renormalization, and thus we numerically study three\nquantities: counter term for renormalization, scattering length of $s$-wave\nboson-diboson scattering, and normalized wavefunction. We confirm that the two\nmethods would lead to the same result.\n", "  A hyperlink is a finite set of non-intersecting simple closed curves in\n$\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. We compute the Wilson Loop observable using a\npath integral with an Einstein-Hilbert action. Using axial-gauge fixing, we can\nwrite this path integral as the limit of a sequence of Chern-Simons integrals,\nstudied earlier in our previous work on the Chern-Simons path integrals in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$. We will show that the Wilson Loop observable can be computed\nfrom a link diagram of a hyperlink, projected on a plane. Only crossings in the\ndiagram will contribute to the path integral. Furthermore, we will show that it\nis invariant under an equivalence relation defined on the set of hyperlinks.\n", "  Chemotaxis is the response of a particle to a gradient in the chemical\ncomposition of the environment. While it was originally observed for biological\norganisms, it is of great interest in the context of synthetic active particles\nsuch as nanomotors. Experimental demonstration of chemotaxis for\nchemically-powered colloidal nanomotor was reported in the literature in the\ncontext of chemo-attraction in a still fluid or in a microfluidic channel where\nthe gradient is sustained by a specific inlet geometry. In this work, we use\nmesoscopic particle-based simulations of the colloid and solvent to demonstrate\nchemotaxis in a microfluidic channel. On the basis of this particle-based\nmodel, we evaluate the chemical concentration profiles in the presence of\npassive or chemically active colloids, compute the chemotactic force acting\nupon them and propose a stochastic model that rationalises our findings on\ncolloidal chemotaxis. Our model is also able to explain the results of an\nearlier simulation work that uses a simpler geometry and to extend its\ninterpretation.\n", "  We present a comprehensive Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) and Neutron\nSpin Echo Spectroscopy (NSE) study of the structural and dynamical aspects of\nthe helimagnetic transition in Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si with $x$ = 0.30. In contrast\nto the sharp transition observed in the archetype chiral magnet MnSi, the\ntransition in Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si is gradual and long-range helimagnetic\nordering coexists with short-range correlations over a wide temperature range.\nThe dynamics are more complex than in MnSi and involve long relaxation times\nwith a stretched exponential relaxation which persists even under magnetic\nfield. These results in conjunction with an analysis of the hierarchy of the\nrelevant length scales show that the helimagnetic transition in\nFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si differs substantially from the transition in MnSi and\nquestion the validity of a universal approach to the helimagnetic transition in\nchiral magnets.\n", "  In this paper, we study the destruction of heavy quarkonium due to the\nentropic force in a deformed $AdS_5$ model. The effects of the deformation\nparameter on the inter-distance and the entropic force are investigated. The\ninfluence of the deformation parameter on the quarkonium dissociation is\nanalyzed. It is shown that the inter-distance increases in the presence of the\ndeformation parameter. In addition, the deformation parameter has the effect of\ndecreasing the entropic force. This results imply that the quarkonium\ndissociates harder in a deformed AdS background than that in an usual AdS\nbackground, in agreement with earlier findings.\n", "  Layered 5$d$ transition iridium oxides, Sr$_2$(Ir,Rh)O$_4$, are described as\nunconventional Mott insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling. The undoped\ncompound, Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, is a nearly ideal two-dimensional pseudospin-$1/2$\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet, similarly to the insulating parent compound of\nhigh-temperature superconducting copper oxides. Using polarized neutron\ndiffraction, we here report a hidden magnetic order in pure and doped\nSr$_2$(Ir,Rh)O$_4$, distinct from the usual antiferromagnetic pseudo-spin\nordering. We find that time-reversal symmetry is broken while the lattice\ntranslation invariance is preserved in the hidden order phase. The onset\ntemperature matches that of the odd-parity hidden order recently highlighted\nusing optical second harmonic generation experiments. The novel magnetic order\nand broken symmetries can be explained by the loop-current model, previously\npredicted for the copper oxide superconductors.\n", "  Working in relativistic quantum field theory, we derive the quantization\ncondition satisfied by coupled two- and three-particle systems of identical\nscalar particles confined to a cubic spatial volume with periodicity $L$. This\ngives the relation between the finite-volume spectrum and the infinite-volume\n$\\textbf 2 \\to \\textbf 2$, $\\textbf 2 \\to \\textbf 3$ and $\\textbf 3 \\to \\textbf\n3$ scattering amplitudes for such theories. The result holds for relativistic\nsystems composed of scalar particles with nonzero mass $m$, whose center of\nmass energy lies below the four-particle threshold, and for which the\ntwo-particle $K$ matrix has no singularities below the three-particle\nthreshold. The quantization condition is exact up to corrections of the order\n$\\mathcal{O}(e^{-mL})$ and holds for any choice of total momenta satisfying the\nboundary conditions.\n", "  Propagation losses in micro-ring resonator waveguides can be determined from\nthe shape of individual resonances in their transmission spectrum. The losses\nare typically extracted by fitting these resonances to an idealized model that\nis derived using scattering theory. Reflections caused by waveguide boundaries\nor stitching errors, however, cause the resonances to become asymmetric,\nresulting in poor fits and unreliable propagation loss coefficients. We derive\na model that takes reflections into account and, by performing full-wave\nsimulations, we show that this model accurately describes the asymmetric\nresonances that result from purely linear effects, yielding accurate\npropagation loss coefficients.\n", "  Merging binary neutron stars (BNSs) represent the ultimate targets for\nmultimessenger astronomy, being among the most promising sources of\ngravitational waves (GWs), and, at the same time, likely accompanied by a\nvariety of electromagnetic counterparts across the entire spectrum, possibly\nincluding short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and kilonova/macronova transients.\nNumerical relativity simulations play a central role in the study of these\nevents. In particular, given the importance of magnetic fields, various aspects\nof this investigation require general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics\n(GRMHD). So far, most GRMHD simulations focused the attention on BNS mergers\nleading to the formation of a hypermassive NS, which, in turn, collapses within\nfew tens of ms into a black hole surrounded by an accretion disk. However,\nrecent observations suggest that a significant fraction of these systems could\nform a long-lived NS remnant, which will either collapse on much longer\ntimescales or remain indefinitely stable. Despite the profound implications for\nthe evolution and the emission properties of the system, a detailed\ninvestigation of this alternative evolution channel is still missing. Here, we\nfollow this direction and present a first detailed GRMHD study of BNS mergers\nforming a long-lived NS. We consider magnetized binaries with different mass\nratios and equations of state and analyze the structure of the NS remnants, the\nrotation profiles, the accretion disks, the evolution and amplification of\nmagnetic fields, and the ejection of matter. Moreover, we discuss the\nconnection with the central engine of SGRBs and provide order-of-magnitude\nestimates for the kilonova/macronova signal. Finally, we study the GW emission,\nwith particular attention to the post-merger phase.\n", "  The paper presents a computational study of the ground-state magnetic phases\nof a selected bilayer graphene nanoflake in external electric field and\nmagnetic field. The electric field has parallel and perpendicular component\nwhile the magnetic field is oriented in plane. The system consists of two\nrectangular layers having armchair edges and zigzag terminations with Bernal\nstacking. The theoretical model is based on a tight binding Hamiltonian with\nHubbard term. The magnetic phase diagram involving the total spin is\nconstructed, showing the stability areas of phases with total spin values equal\nto 0 and 1. A significant stability range of antiferromagnetic, layer-like\narrangements is found and extensively discussed. The possibility of switching\nbetween nonmagnetic, antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic phases with both\ncomponents of external electric field is demonstrated, being a manifestation of\na magnetoelectric effect. The influence of magnetic field on the phase diagrams\nis analysed.\n", "  The isolation of graphene and transition metal dichalcongenides has opened a\nveritable world to a great number of layered materials which can be exfoliated,\nmanipulated, and stacked or combined at will. With continued explorations\nexpanding to include other layered materials with unique attributes, it is\nbecoming clear that no one material will fill all the post-silicon era\nrequirements. Here we review the properties and applications of layered,\nquasi-one dimensional transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs) as novel\nmaterials for next generation electronics and optoelectronics. The TMTCs\npresent a unique chain-like structure which gives the materials their quasi-one\ndimensional properties such as high anisotropy ratios in conductivity and\nlinear dichroism. The range of band gaps spanned by this class of materials\n(0.2 eV- 2 eV) makes them suitable for a wide variety of applications including\nfield-effect transistors, infrared, visible and ultraviolet photodetectors, and\nunique applications related to their anisotropic properties which opens another\ndegree of freedom in the development of next generation electronics. In this\nreview we survey the historical development of these remarkable materials with\nan emphasis on the recent activity generated by the isolation and\ncharacterization of atomically thin titanium trisulfide (TiS3).\n", "  Sub-diffraction resolution imaging has played a pivotal role in biological\nresearch by visualizing key, but previously unresolvable, sub-cellular\nstructures. Unfortunately, applications of far-field sub-diffraction resolution\nare currently divided between fluorescent and coherent-diffraction regimes, and\na multimodal sub-diffraction technique that bridges this gap has not yet been\ndemonstrated. Here we report that structured illumination (SI) allows\nmultimodal sub-diffraction imaging of both coherent quantitative-phase (QP) and\nfluorescence. Due to the conventional fluorescent applications of SI, we first\ndemonstrated the principle of SI-enabled three-dimensional (3D) QP\nsub-diffraction imaging with calibration microspheres. Image analysis confirmed\nenhanced lateral and axial resolutions over diffraction-limited QP imaging, and\nestablished striking parallels between coherent SI and conventional optical\ndiffraction tomography. We next introduce an optical system utilizing SI to\nachieve 3D sub-diffraction, multimodal QP/fluorescent visualization of A549\nbiological cells fluorescently tagged for F-actin. Our results suggest that SI\nhas unique utility in studying biological phenomena with significant molecular,\nbiophysical, and biochemical components.\n", "  Here we reveal details of the interaction between human lysozyme proteins,\nboth native and fibrils, and their water environment by intense terahertz time\ndomain spectroscopy. With the aid of a rigorous dielectric model, we determine\nthe amplitude and phase of the oscillating dipole induced by the THz field in\nthe volume containing the protein and its hydration water. At low\nconcentrations, the amplitude of this induced dipolar response decreases with\nincreasing concentration. Beyond a certain threshold, marking the onset of the\ninteractions between the extended hydration shells, the amplitude remains fixed\nbut the phase of the induced dipolar response, which is initially in phase with\nthe applied THz field, begins to change. The changes observed in the THz\nresponse reveal protein-protein interactions me-diated by extended hydration\nlayers, which may control fibril formation and may have an important role in\nchemical recognition phenomena.\n", "  By developing a molecular dynamics model of bacterial chemotaxis, we present\nthe first investigation of tracer statistics in bacterial suspensions where\nchemotactic effects are considered. We demonstrate that the non-Gaussian\nstatistics of full-coated tracer arises from the athermal bacterial noise.\nMoreover, Janus (half-coated) tracer performs a composite random walk combining\npower-law-tail distributed L\\'{e}vy flights with Brownian jiggling at low\ncoating concentration, but turns to an enhanced directional transport (EDT)\nwhen coating concentration is high. Unlike conventional self-propelled\nparticles, upon increasing coating concentration, the direction of EDT\ncounterintuitively reverses from along to against the tracer orientation. Both\nthese transitions are identified to be second-order, with the phase boundaries\nmeeting at a triple point. A theoretical modeling that reveals the origin of\nsuch anomalous transport behaviors is proposed. Our findings reveal the\nfundamental nonequilibrium physics of active matter under external stimuli, and\nunderscore the crucial role of asymmetrical environment in regulating the\ntransport processes in biological systems.\n", "  We explicitly describe an expansion of $e^{A+B}$ as an infinite sum of the\nproducts of $B$ multiplied by the exponential function of $A$. This is the\nexplicit description of the Zassenhaus formula. We also express the\nBaker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula in a different manner.\n", "  Research on black phosphorus (BP) has been experiencing a renaissance over\nthe last few years, after the demonstration that few-layer BP exhibits high\ncarrier mobility and a thickness-dependent band gap. For a long time, bulk BP\nis also known to be a superconductor under high pressure exceeding 10 GPa. The\nsuperconductivity is due to a structural transformation into another allotrope\nof phosphorous and accompanied by a semiconductor-metal transition. No\nsuperconductivity could be achieved for BP itself (that is, in its normal\northorhombic form) despite several attempts reported in the literature. Here we\ndescribe successful intercalation of BP by several alkali metals (Li, K, Rb,\nCs) and alkali-earth Ca. All the intercalated compounds are found to be\nsuperconducting, exhibiting the same (within our experimental accuracy)\ncritical temperature of 3.8+-0.1 K and practically identical characteristics in\nthe superconducting state. Such universal superconductivity, independent of the\nchemical composition, is highly unusual. We attribute it to intrinsic\nsuperconductivity of heavily-doped individual phosphorene layers, while the\nintercalated layers of metal atoms mostly play a role of charge reservoirs.\n", "  This study addresses the effect of the magnetic hyperfine interaction on the\nrelativistic H1s wave functions. These are used to calculate the electric,\nmagnetic, and confinement force densities acting on the 1s electron. The\nmagnetic field couples Dirac equations for different angular momenta. These are\nsolved numerically for the hyperfine singlet and triplet, as well as for a\nclassical magnetic dipole. In the singlet ground state the hyperfine\ninteraction shifts the electron density toward the proton. A similar shift is\nfound for the classical dipole, and an opposite shift for the triplet. The\ncross-over between charge accumulation and depletion occurs at 1.325 times the\nBohr radius. The behavior of the wave functions is investigated down to\ndistances smaller than the proton radius, including the incorporation of\nvirtual positrons. The force densities are determined and balanced against each\nother.\n", "  We develop a new scheme for determining molecular partial atomic charges\n(PACs) with external electrostatic potential (ESP) closely mimicking that of\nthe molecule. The PACs are the \"minimal corrections\" to a reference-set of PACs\nnecessary for reproducing exactly the tensor components of the Cartesian zero-\nfirst- and second- molecular electrostatic multipoles. We evaluate the quality\nof ESP reproduction when \"minimally correcting\" (MC) Mulliken, Hirshfeld or\niterated-Hirshfeld reference PACs. In all these cases the MC-PACs significantly\nimprove the ESP while preserving the reference PACs' invariance under the\nmolecular symmetry operations. When iterative-Hirshfeld PACs are used as\nreference the MC-PACs yield ESPs of comparable quality to those of the ChElPG\ncharge fitting method.\n", "  In this third paper of a series dedicated to a dispersive treatment of the\nhadronic light-by-light (HLbL) tensor, we derive a partial-wave formulation for\ntwo-pion intermediate states in the HLbL contribution to the anomalous magnetic\nmoment of the muon $(g-2)_\\mu$, including a detailed discussion of the\nunitarity relation for arbitrary partial waves. We show that obtaining a final\nexpression free from unphysical helicity partial waves is a subtle issue, which\nwe thoroughly clarify. As a by-product, we obtain a set of sum rules that could\nbe used to constrain future calculations of $\\gamma^*\\gamma^*\\to\\pi\\pi$. We\nvalidate the formalism extensively using the pion-box contribution, defined by\ntwo-pion intermediate states with a pion-pole left-hand cut, and demonstrate\nhow the full known result is reproduced when resumming the partial waves. Using\ndispersive fits to high-statistics data for the pion vector form factor, we\nprovide an evaluation of the full pion box,\n$a_\\mu^{\\pi\\text{-box}}=-15.9(2)\\times 10^{-11}$. As an application of the\npartial-wave formalism, we present a first calculation of $\\pi\\pi$-rescattering\neffects in HLbL scattering, with $\\gamma^*\\gamma^*\\to\\pi\\pi$ helicity partial\nwaves constructed dispersively using $\\pi\\pi$ phase shifts derived from the\ninverse-amplitude method. In this way, the isospin-$0$ part of our calculation\ncan be interpreted as the contribution of the $f_0(500)$ to HLbL scattering in\n$(g-2)_\\mu$. We argue that the contribution due to charged-pion rescattering\nimplements corrections related to the corresponding pion polarizability and\nshow that these are moderate. Our final result for the sum of pion-box\ncontribution and its $S$-wave rescattering corrections reads\n$a_\\mu^{\\pi\\text{-box}} + a_{\\mu,J=0}^{\\pi\\pi,\\pi\\text{-pole LHC}}=-24(1)\\times\n10^{-11}$.\n", "  We present a mixed-dimensional atomic gas system to unambiguously detect and\nsystematically probe mediated interactions. In our scheme, fermionic atoms are\nconfined in two parallel planes and interact via exchange of elementary\nexcitations in a three-dimensional background gas. This interaction gives rise\nto a frequency shift of the out-of-phase dipole oscillations of the two clouds,\nwhich we calculate using a strong coupling theory taking the two-body\nmixed-dimensional scattering into account exactly. The shift is shown to be\neasily measurable for strong interactions and can be used as a probe for\nmediated interactions.\n", "  The recent discovery of superconductivity in BaFe$_2$S$_3$ [Takahashi {\\it et\nal.}, Nat. Mater. {\\bf 14}, 1008 (2015)] has stimulated considerable interest\nin 123-type iron chalcogenides. This material is the first reported iron-based\ntwo-leg ladder superconductor, as opposed to the prevailing two-dimensional\nlayered structures of the iron superconductors family. Once the hydrostatic\npressure exceeds $11$ GPa, BaFe$_2$S$_3$ changes from a semiconductor to a\nsuperconductor below $24$~K. Although previous calculations correctly explained\nits ground state magnetic state and electronic structure, the pressure induced\nphase transition was not successfully reproduced. In this work, our first\nprinciples calculations find that with increasing pressure the lattice\nconstants as well as local magnetic moments are gradually suppressed, followed\nby a first-order magnetic transition at a critical pressure, with local\nmagnetic moments dropping to zero suddenly. Our calculations suggests that the\nself-doping caused by electrons transferred from S to Fe may play a key role in\nthis transition. The development of a nonmagnetic metallic phase at high\npressure may pave the way to superconductivity. As extensions of this effort,\ntwo other 123-type iron chalcogenides, KFe$_2$S$_3$ and KFe$_2$Se$_3$, have\nalso been investigated. KFe$_2$S$_3$ also displays a first-order transition\nwith increasing pressure, but KFe$_2$Se$_3$ shows instead a second-order, or\nweakly first-order, transition. The required pressures for KFe$_2$S$_3$ and\nKFe$_2$Se$_3$ to quench the magnetism are higher than for BaFe$_2$S$_3$.\nFurther experiments can confirm the predicted first-order nature of the\ntransition in BaFe$_2$S$_3$ and KFe$_2$S$_3$, as well as the possible\nmetallic/superconductivity state in other 123-type iron chalcogenides under\nhigh pressure.\n", "  A fundamental process in astrophysics is the matching of two photometric\ncatalogues. It is crucial that the correct objects be paired, and that their\nphotometry does not suffer from any spurious additional flux. We compare the\npositions of sources in WISE, IPHAS, 2MASS, and APASS with Gaia DR1 astrometric\npositions. We find that the separations are described by a combination of a\nGaussian distribution, wider than naively assumed based on their quoted\nuncertainties, and a large wing, which some authors ascribe to proper motions.\nWe show that this is caused by flux contamination from blended stars not\ntreated separately. We provide linear fits between the quoted Gaussian\nuncertainty and the core fit to the separation distributions.\n  We show that at least one in three of the stars in the faint half of a given\ncatalogue will suffer from flux contamination above the 1% level when the\ndensity of catalogue objects per PSF area is above approximately 0.005. This\nhas important implications for the creation of composite catalogues. It is\nimportant for any closest neighbour matches as there will be a given fraction\nof matches that are flux contaminated, while some matches will be missed due to\nsignificant astrometric perturbation by faint contaminants. In the case of\nprobability-based matching, this contamination affects the probability density\nfunction of matches as a function of distance. This effect results in up to 50%\nfewer counterparts being returned as matches, assuming Gaussian astrometric\nuncertainties for WISE-Gaia matching in crowded Galactic plane regions,\ncompared with a closest neighbour match.\n", "  This paper proposes that cognitive humor can be modeled using the\nmathematical framework of quantum theory. We begin with brief overviews of both\nresearch on humor, and the generalized quantum framework. We show how the\nbisociation of incongruous frames or word meanings in jokes can be modeled as a\nlinear superposition of a set of basis states, or possible interpretations, in\na complex Hilbert space. The choice of possible interpretations depends on the\ncontext provided by the set-up vs. the punchline of a joke. We apply the\napproach to a verbal pun, and consider how it might be extended to frame\nblending. An initial study of that made use of the Law of Total Probability,\ninvolving 85 participant responses to 35 jokes (as well as variants), suggests\nthat the Quantum Theory of Humor (QTH) proposed here provides a viable new\napproach to modeling humor.\n", "  Nonlinear systems can exhibit a rich set of dynamics that are inherently\nsensitive to their initial conditions. One such example is modulational\ninstability, which is believed to be one of the most prevalent instabilities in\nnature. By exploiting a shallow zero-crossing of a Feshbach resonance, we\ncharacterize modulational instability and its role in the formation of\nmatter-wave soliton trains from a Bose-Einstein condensate. We examine the\nuniversal scaling laws exhibited by the system, and through real-time imaging,\naddress a long-standing question of whether the solitons in trains are created\nwith effectively repulsive nearest neighbor interactions, or rather, evolve\ninto such a structure.\n", "  It has been long hoped that the realization of long-range ferromagnetic order\nin two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals, combined with their rich\nelectronic and optical properties, would open up new possibilities for\nmagnetic, magnetoelectric and magneto-optic applications. However, in 2D\nsystems, the long-range magnetic order is strongly hampered by thermal\nfluctuations which may be counteracted by magnetic anisotropy, according to the\nMermin-Wagner theorem. Prior efforts via defect and composition engineering,\nand proximity effect only locally or extrinsically introduce magnetic\nresponses. Here we report the first experimental discovery of intrinsic\nlong-range ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 atomic layers by scanning\nmagneto-optic Kerr microscopy. In such a 2D vdW soft ferromagnet, for the first\ntime, an unprecedented control of transition temperature of ~ 35% - 57%\nenhancement is realized via surprisingly small fields (<= 0.3 Tesla in this\nwork), in stark contrast to the stiffness of the transition temperature to\nmagnetic fields in the three-dimensional regime. We found that the small\napplied field enables an effective anisotropy far surpassing the tiny\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy, opening up a sizable spin wave excitation gap.\nConfirmed by renormalized spin wave theory, we explain the phenomenon and\nconclude that the unusual field dependence of transition temperature\nconstitutes a hallmark of 2D soft ferromagnetic vdW crystals. Our discovery of\n2D soft ferromagnetic Cr2Ge2Te6 presents a close-to-ideal 2D Heisenberg\nferromagnet for studying fundamental spin behaviors, and opens the door for\nexploring new applications such as ultra-compact spintronics.\n", "  Ab initio quantum mechanics, classical molecular dynamics and two-temperature\nmodel integrated multiscale simulation is carried out to study the film\nthickness dependent the femtosecond laser heating of silver. As an interval of\n130.7296 nm, five silver films with increasing thickness from 392.1888 nm to\n915.1072 nm are simulated. The absorbed laser fluence of 0.1 J/cm^2 and 0.3\nJ/cm^2 are chosen to observe the laser spallation and ablation. The simulation\nresults show that film thickness has close correlation with the Kelvin degree\nof heating of the laser irradiated silver films, which further affects the\nlaser spallation and ablation. Thicker film prolongs the time cost of the laser\ninduced compressive thermal stress propagating through silver film and the rear\nsurface reflection of compressive thermal stress into tensile thermal stress,\nwhich delays the tensile stress spallation. Suggestions for precise\nmicromachining are proposed in this paper.\n", "  Background: Component-based modeling language Modelica (OpenModelica is open\nsource implementation) is used for the numerical simulation of complex\nprocesses of different nature represented by ODE system. However, in\nOpenModelica standard library there is no routines for pseudo-random numbers\ngeneration, which makes it impossible to use for stochastic modeling processes.\nPurpose: The goal of this article is a brief overview of a number of algorithms\nfor generation a sequence of uniformly distributed pseudo random numbers and\nquality assessment of the sequence given by them, as well as the ways to\nimplement some of these algorithms in OpenModelica system. Methods: All the\nalgorithms are implemented in C language, and the results of their work tested\nusing open source package DieHarder. For those algorithms that do not use bit\noperations, we describe there realisation using OpwnModelica. The other\nalgorithms can be called in OpenModelica as C functions Results: We have\nimplemented and tested about nine algorithms. DieHarder testing revealed the\nhighest quality pseudo-random number generators. Also we have reviewed\nlibraries Noise and AdvancedNoise, who claim to be adding to the Modelica\nStandard Library. Conclusions: In OpenModelica system can be implemented\ngenerators of uniformly distributed pseudo-random numbers, which is the first\nstep towards to make OpenModelica suitable for simulation of stochastic\nprocesses.\n", "  A modified Hayward black hole is a nonsingular black hole. It is proposed to\nform when the pressure generated by quantum gravity can stop matter's collapse\nas the matter reaches Planck density. Strong deflection gravitational lensing\nhappening nearby its event horizon might provide some clues of these quantum\neffects in its central core. We investigate observables of the strong\ndeflection lensing, including angular separations, brightness differences and\ntime delays between its relativistic images, and estimate their values for the\nsupermassive black hole in the Galactic center. We find that it is possible to\ndistinguish the modified Hayward black hole from a Schwarzschild one, but it\ndemands very high resolution beyond current stage.\n", "  We present a generalized (2+1)-dimensional Boussinesq equation, including two\ncases which are called the plus Boussinesq equation and the minus one. To\ninvestigate these equations, we apply the $\\bar{\\partial}$ approach to a\ncoupled (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear equation, which reduces to the Boussinesq\nequation. For the plus equation, we give the line-solitons and rational\nsolutions, for the minus one, we give some freak solutions.\n", "  Gravitationally focused wind accretion in binary systems consisting of an\nevolved star with a gaseous envelope and a compact accreting companion is a\npossible mechanism to explain mass transfer in symbiotic binaries. We study the\nmass accretion around the secondary caused by the strong wind from the primary\nlate-type component using global three-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical\nsimulations during quiescence and outburst stages. In particular, the\ndependence of the mass accretion rate on the mass-loss rate, wind parameters\nand phases of wind outburst development is considered. For a typical wind from\nan asymptotic giant branch star with a mass-loss rate of 1e-6 Msun/year and\nwind speeds of 20-50 km/s, the mass transfer through a focused wind results in\nefficient infall on to the secondary. Accretion rates onto the secondary of\n5-20 per cent of the mass-loss from the primary are obtained during quiescence\nand outburst periods where the wind velocity and mass-loss rates are varied,\nabout 20-50 per cent larger than in the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton\napproximation. This mechanism could be an important method for explaining\nobserved accretion luminosities and periodic modulations in the accretion rates\nfor a broad range of interacting binary systems.\n", "  The creep behaviour of a creep-resistant AE42 magnesium alloy reinforced with\nSaffil short fibres and SiC particulates in various combinations has been\nexamined in the longitudinal direction, i.e., the plane containing random fibre\norientation was parallel to the loading direction, in the temperature range of\n175-300 C at the stress levels ranging from 60 to 140 MPa using impression\ncreep test technique. At 175 C, normal creep behaviour, i.e., strain rate\ndecreasing with strain and then reaching a steady state, is observed at all the\nstresses employed. At 240 C, normal creep behaviour is observed up to 80 MPa\nand reverse creep behaviour, i.e., strain rate increasing with strain, then\nreaching a steady state and again decreasing, is observed above that stress. At\n300 C, reverse creep behaviour is observed at all the stresses employed. This\npattern remains the same for all the composites. The reverse creep behaviour is\nfound to be associated with the fibre breakage. The stress exponent is found to\nbe very high for all the composites. However, after taking the threshold stress\ninto account, the stress exponent varies from 3.9 to 7.0, which suggests\nviscous glide and dislocation climb being the dominant creep mechanisms. The\napparent activation energy Qc was not calculated due to insufficient data at\nany stress level either for normal or reverse creep behaviour. The creep\nresistance of the hybrid composites is found to be comparable to that of the\ncomposite reinforced with 20% Saffil short fibres at all the temperatures and\nstress levels investigated.\n", "  We consider the three most important equations of hypergeometric type,\n${}_2F_1$, ${}_1F_1$ and ${}_1F_0$, in the so-called degenerate case. In this\ncase one of the parameters, usually denoted $c$, is an integer and the standard\nbasis of solutions consists of a hypergeometric-type function and a function\nwith a logarithmic singularity. This article is devoted to a thorough analysis\nof the latter solution to all three equations.\n", "  A commonly noted feature of the population of multi-planet extrasolar systems\nis the rarity of planet pairs in low-order mean-motion resonances. We revisit\nthe physics of resonance capture via convergent disk-driven migration. We point\nout that for planet spacings typical of stable configurations for Kepler\nsystems, the planets can routinely maintain a small but nonzero eccentricity\ndue to gravitational perturbations from their neighbors. Together with the\nupper limit on the migration rate needed for capture, the finite eccentricity\ncan make resonance capture difficult or impossible in Sun-like systems for\nplanets smaller than ~Neptune-sized. This mass limit on efficient capture is\nbroadly consistent with observed exoplanet pairs that have mass determinations:\nof pairs with the heavier planet exterior to the lighter planet -- which would\nhave been undergoing convergent migration in their disks -- those in or nearly\nin resonance are much more likely to have total mass greater than two Neptune\nmasses than to have smaller masses. The agreement suggests that the observed\npaucity of resonant pairs around sun-like stars may simply arise from a small\nresonance capture probability for lower-mass planets. Planet pairs that thereby\navoid resonance capture are much less likely to collide in an eventual close\napproach than to simply migrate past one another to become a divergently\nmigrating pair with the lighter planet exterior. For systems around M stars we\nexpect resonant pairs to be much more common, since there the minimum mass\nthreshhold for efficient capture is about an Earth mass.\n", "  We present in this work a new reconstruction scheme, so-called\nMUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme, to solve the five-equation model for interfacial two\nphase flows. This scheme employs the traditional shock capturing MUSCL\n(Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Law) scheme as well as the\ninterface sharpening THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing)\nscheme as two building-blocks of spatial reconstruction using the BVD (boundary\nvariation diminishing) principle that minimizes the variations (jumps) of the\nreconstructed variables at cell boundaries, and thus effectively reduces the\nnumerical dissipations in numerical solutions. The MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme is\nimplemented to all state variables and volume fraction, which realizes the\nconsistency among volume fraction and other physical variables. Benchmark tests\nare carried out to verify the capability of the present method in capturing the\nmaterial interface as a well-defined sharp jump in volume fraction, as well as\nsignificant improvement in solution quality. The proposed scheme is a simple\nand effective method of practical significance for simulating compressible\ninterfacial multiphase flows.\n", "  In this thesis we present research into linear perturbations in\nLemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) and Assisted Coupled Quintessence (ACQ)\nCosmologies. First we give a brief overview of the standard model of cosmology.\nWe then introduce Cosmological Perturbation Theory (CPT) at linear order for a\nflat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology. Next we study linear\nperturbations to a Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) background spacetime. Studying\nthe transformation behaviour of the perturbations under gauge transformations,\nwe construct gauge invariant quantities in LTB. We show, using the perturbed\nenergy conservation equation, that there is a conserved quantity in LTB which\nis conserved on all scales. We then briefly extend our discussion to the\nLemaitre spacetime, and construct gauge-invariant perturbations in this\nextension of LTB spacetime. We also study the behaviour of linear perturbations\nin assisted coupled quintessence models in a FRW background. We provide the\nfull set of governing equations for this class of models, and solve the system\nnumerically. The code written for this purpose is then used to evolve growth\nfunctions for various models and parameter values, and we compare these both to\nthe standard $\\Lambda$CDM model and to current and future observational bounds.\nWe also examine the applicability of the \"small scale approximation\", often\nused to calculate growth functions in quintessence models, in light of upcoming\nexperiments such as SKA and Euclid. We find the results of the full equations\ndeviates from the approximation by more than the experimental uncertainty for\nthese future surveys. The construction of the numerical code, PYESSENCE,\nwritten in Python to solve the system of background and perturbed evolution\nequations for assisted coupled quintessence, is also discussed.\n", "  Deep observations of nearby galaxy clusters with Chandra have revealed\nconcave 'bay' structures in a number of systems (Perseus, Centaurus and Abell\n1795), which have similar X-ray and radio properties. These bays have all the\nproperties of cold fronts, where the temperature rises and density falls\nsharply, but are concave rather than convex. By comparing to simulations of gas\nsloshing, we find that the bay in the Perseus cluster bears a striking\nresemblance in its size, location and thermal structure, to a giant\n($\\approx$50 kpc) roll resulting from Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. If true,\nthe morphology of this structure can be compared to simulations to put\nconstraints on the initial average ratio of the thermal and magnetic pressure,\n$\\beta= p_{\\rm th} / p_{\\rm B}$, throughout the overall cluster before the\nsloshing occurs, for which we find $\\beta=200$ to best match the observations.\nSimulations with a stronger magnetic field ($\\beta=100$) are disfavoured, as in\nthese the large Kelvin-Helmholtz rolls do not form, while in simulations with a\nlower magnetic field ($\\beta=500$) the level of instabilities is much larger\nthan is observed. We find that the bay structures in Centaurus and Abell 1795\nmay also be explained by such features of gas sloshing.\n", "  We suggest that ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) may be accelerated\nin ultra-relativistic flows via a one-shot mechanism, the \"espresso\"\nacceleration, in which already-energetic particles are generally boosted by a\nfactor of $\\sim\\Gamma^2$ in energy, where $\\Gamma$ is the flow Lorentz factor.\nMore precisely, we consider blazar-like jets with $\\Gamma\\gtrsim 30$\npropagating into a halo of \"seed\" CRs produced in supernova remnants, which can\naccelerate UHECRs up to $10^{20}$\\,eV. Such a re-acceleration process naturally\naccounts for the chemical composition measured by the Pierre Auger\nCollaboration, which resembles the one around and above the knee in the CR\nspectrum, and is consistent with the distribution of potential sources in the\nlocal universe, particularly intriguing is the coincidence of the powerful\nblazar Mrk 421 with the hotspot reported by the Telescope Array Collaboration.\n", "  In this study we map out the large-scale structure of citation networks of\nscience journals and follow their evolution in time by using stochastic block\nmodels (SBMs). The SBM fitting procedures are principled methods that can be\nused to find hierarchical grouping of journals into blocks that show similar\nincoming and outgoing citations patterns. These methods work directly on the\ncitation network without the need to construct auxiliary networks based on\nsimilarity of nodes. We fit the SBMs to the networks of journals we have\nconstructed from the data set of around 630 million citations and find a\nvariety of different types of blocks, such as clusters, bridges, sources, and\nsinks. In addition we use a recent generalization of SBMs to determine how much\na manually curated classification of journals into subfields of science is\nrelated to the block structure of the journal network and how this relationship\nchanges in time. The SBM method tries to find a network of blocks that is the\nbest high-level representation of the network of journals, and we illustrate\nhow these block networks (at various levels of resolution) can be used as maps\nof science.\n", "  This paper presents a novel method for the reconstruction of interaction\nvertices in particle collision data. The algorithm is an agglomerative\nclustering technique designed for high-luminosity environments in current and\nfuture proton-proton colliders. Studies are presented in benchmark scenarios\nreproducing the LHC data-taking conditions and showing the performance as a\nfunction of the number of interactions per bunch crossing. Particular focus\nwill be given to the foreseen data-taking conditions at the Run 3 of the LHC.\nThe proposed algorithm is found to significantly improve the position\nresolution on the hard-scatter interaction by limiting the contamination of\ntracks from additional interactions in the vertex fit.\n", "  Collective motion of cells is common in many physiological processes,\nincluding tissue development, repair, and tumor formation. Recent experiments\nhave shown that certain malignant cancer cells form clusters in a\nchemoattractant gradient, which display three different phases of motion:\ntranslational, rotational, and random. Intriguingly, all three phases are\nobserved simultaneously, with clusters spontaneously switching between these\nmodes of motion. The origin of this behavior is not understood at present,\nespecially the robust appearance of cluster rotations. Guided by experiments on\nthe motion of two-dimensional clusters in-vitro, we developed an agent based\nmodel in which the cells form a cohesive cluster due to attractive and\nalignment interactions but with potentially different behaviors based on their\nlocal environment. We find that when cells at the cluster rim are more motile,\nall three phases of motion coexist, in excellent agreement with the\nobservations. Using the model we can identify that the transitions between\ndifferent phases are driven by a competition between an ordered rim and a\ndisordered core accompanied by the creation and annihilation of topological\ndefects in the velocity field. The model makes definite predictions regarding\nthe dependence of the motility phase of the cluster on its size and external\nchemical gradient, which agree with our experimental data. Our results suggest\nthat heterogeneous behavior of individuals, based on local environment, can\nlead to novel, experimentally observed phases of collective motion.\n", "  We investigate the effect of periodic and disordered distributions of pairing\ncenters in a one-dimensional itinerant system to obtain the microscopic\nconditions required to achieve an end Majorana mode and the topological phase\ndiagram. Remarkably, the topological invariant can be generally expressed in\nterms of the physical parameters for any pairing center configuration. Such a\nfundamental relation allows us to unveil hidden local symmetries and to\nidentify trajectories in the parameter space that preserve the non-trivial\ntopological character of the ground state. We identify the phase diagram with\ntopologically non-trivial domains where Majorana modes are completely\nunaffected by the spatial distribution of the pairing centers. These results\nare general and apply to several systems where inhomogeneous perturbations\ngenerate stable Majorana modes.\n", "  Free energy is energy that is available to do work. Maximizing the free\nenergy gain and the gain in work that can be extracted from a system is\nimportant for a wide variety of physical and technological processes, from\nenergy harvesting processes such as photosynthesis to energy storage systems\nsuch as fuels and batteries. This paper extends recent results from\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamics and quantum resource theory to derive\nclosed-form solutions for the maximum possible gain in free energy and\nextractable work that can be obtained by varying the initial states of\nclassical and quantum stochastic processes. Simple formulae allow the\ncomparison the free energy increase for the optimal procedure with that for a\nsub-optimal procedure. The problem of finding the optimal free-energy\nharvesting procedure is shown to be convex and solvable via gradient descent.\n", "  Current searches for a dark photon in the mass range below 1 GeV require an\nelectron-positron collider with a luminosity at the level of at least $10^{34}$\ncm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. The challenge is that, at such low energies, the collider\nluminosity rapidly drops off due to increase in the beam sizes, strong mutual\nfocusing of the colliding beams, and enhancement of collective effects. Using\nrecent advances in accelerator technology such as the nano-beam scheme of\nSuperKEK-B, high-current Energy Recovery Linacs (ERL), and magnetized beams, we\npropose a new configuration of an electron-positron collider based on a\npositron storage ring and an electron ERL. It allows one to achieve a\nluminosity of $>10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at the center of momentum energy of\n<1 GeV. We present general considerations and a specific example of such a\nfacility using the parameters of the SuperKEK-B positron storage ring and\nCornell ERL project.\n", "  Using recently available GaN FETs, a 600 Volt three-stage, multi-FET switch\nhas been developed having 2 nanosecond rise time driving a 200 Ohm load with\nthe potential of approaching 30 MHz average switching rates. Possible\napplications include driving particle beam choppers kicking bunch-by-bunch and\nbeam deflectors where the rise time needs to be custom tailored. This paper\nreports on the engineering issues addressed, the design approach taken and some\nperformance results of this switch.\n", "  In this paper we prove the Hardy inequalities for the quadratic form of the\nLaplacian with the Landau Hamiltonian magnetic field. Moreover, we obtain\nPoincar\\'e type inequality and inequalities with more general families of\nweights, all with estimates for the remainder terms of these inequalities.\nFurthermore, we establish weighted Hardy inequalities for the quadratic form of\nthe magnetic Baouendi-Grushin operator for the magnetic field of Aharonov-Bohm\ntype. For these, we show refinements of the known Hardy inequalities for the\nBaouendi-Grushin operator involving radial derivatives in some of the\nvariables. The corresponding uncertainty type principles are also obtained.\n", "  An interlock system has been designed for the Fermilab Cryo-module Test Stand\n(CMTS), a test bed for the cryomodules to be used in the upcoming Linac\nCoherent Light Source 2 (LCLS-II) project at SLAC. The interlock system\nfeatures 8 independent subsystems, one per superconducting RF cavity and solid\nstate amplifier (SSA) pair. Each system monitors several devices to detect\nfault conditions such as arcing in the waveguides or quenching of the SRF\nsystem. Additionally each system can detect fault conditions by monitoring the\nRF power seen at the cavity coupler through a directional coupler. In the event\nof a fault condition, each system is capable of removing RF signal to the\namplifier (via a fast RF switch) as well as turning off the SSA. Additionally,\neach input signal is available for remote viewing and recording via a Fermilab\ndesigned digitizer board and MVME 5500 processor.\n", "  The Illinois Accelerator Research Center (IARC) hosts a new accelerator\ndevelopment program at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. IARC provides\naccess to Fermi's state-of-the-art facilities and technologies for research,\ndevelopment and industrialization of particle accelerator technology. In\naddition to facilitating access to available existing Fermi infrastructure, the\nIARC Campus has a dedicated 36,000 ft2 heavy assembly building (HAB) with all\nthe infrastructure needed to develop, commission and operate new accelerators.\nConnected to the HAB is a 47,000 ft2 Office, Technology and Engineering (OTE)\nbuilding, paid for by the state, that has office, meeting, and light technical\nspace. The OTE building, which contains the Accelerator Physics Center, and\nnearby Accelerator and Technical divisions provide IARC collaborators with\nunique access to world class expertise in a wide array of accelerator\ntechnologies. At IARC scientists and engineers from Fermilab and academia work\nside by side with industrial partners to develop breakthroughs in accelerator\nscience and translate them into applications for the nation's health, wealth\nand security.\n", "  In the present work we address the issue concerning the relation mass versus\nradius for bosonic stars, all this in the context of the theory of ultra-cold\ngases in the dilute regime and within the realm of Newtonian gravity. It will\nbe shown that this model predicts a minimum and a maximum for the mass of this\nkind of stars, contrary to the current belief present in some results in this\ndirection.\n", "  Any simulation of the r-process is affected by uncertainties in our present\nknowledge of nuclear physics quantities and astrophysical conditions. It is\ncommon to quantify the impact of these uncertainties through a global\nsensitivity metric, which is then used to identify specific nuclides that would\nbe most worthwhile to measure experimentally. Using descriptive statistics, we\nassess a set of metrics used in previous sensitivity studies, as well as a new\nlogarithmic measure. For certain neutron-rich nuclides lying near the r-process\npath for the typical hot-wind scenario, we find opposing conclusions on their\nrelative sensitivity implied by different metrics, although they all generally\nagree which ones are the most sensitive nuclei. The underlying reason is that\nsensitivity metrics which simply sum over variations in the r-process\ndistribution depend on the scaling used in the baseline, which often varies\nbetween simulations. We show that normalization of the abundances causes\nchanges in the reported sensitivity factors and recommend reporting a minimized\nF statistic in addition to a scale estimation for rough calibration to be used\nwhen comparing tables of sensitivity factors from different studies.\n", "  We describe how to construct a dodecahedron, tetrahedron, cube, and\noctahedron out of pvc pipes using standard fittings.\n", "  In this technical note we show how to reach a remarkable speed up when\nsolving elliptic partial differential equations with finite differences thanks\nto the joint use of the Chebyshev-Jacobi method with high order discretizations\nand its parallel implementation over GPUs.\n", "  Finding accurate reduced descriptions for large, complex, dynamically\nevolving networks is a crucial enabler to their simulation, analysis, and,\nultimately, design. Here we propose and illustrate a systematic and powerful\napproach to obtaining good collective coarse-grained observables-- variables\nsuccessfully summarizing the detailed state of such networks. Finding such\nvariables can naturally lead to successful reduced dynamic models for the\nnetworks. The main premise enabling our approach is the assumption that the\nbehavior of a node in the network depends (after a short initial transient) on\nthe node identity: a set of descriptors that quantify the node properties,\nwhether intrinsic (e.g. parameters in the node evolution equations) or\nstructural (imparted to the node by its connectivity in the particular network\nstructure). The approach creates a natural link with modeling and\n\"computational enabling technology\" developed in the context of Uncertainty\nQuantification. In our case, however, we will not focus on ensembles of\ndifferent realizations of a problem, each with parameters randomly selected\nfrom a distribution. We will instead study many coupled heterogeneous units,\neach characterized by randomly assigned (heterogeneous) parameter value(s). One\ncould then coin the term Heterogeneity Quantification for this approach, which\nwe illustrate through a model dynamic network consisting of coupled oscillators\nwith one intrinsic heterogeneity (oscillator individual frequency) and one\nstructural heterogeneity (oscillator degree in the undirected network). The\ncomputational implementation of the approach, its shortcomings and possible\nextensions are also discussed.\n", "  The dark matter search project by means of ultra high purity NaI(Tl)\nscintillator is now underdevelopment. An array of large volume NaI(Tl)\ndetectors whose volume is 12.7 cm$\\phi\\times$12.7 cm is applied to search for\ndark matter signal. To remove radioactive impurities in NaI(Tl) crystal is one\nof the most important task to find small number of dark matter signals. We have\ndeveloped high purity NaI(Tl) crystal which contains small amounts of\nradioactive impurities, $<4$ ppb of $^{nat}$K, 0.3 ppt of Th chain, 58\n$\\mu$Bq/kg of $^{226}$Ra and 30 $\\mu$Bq/kg of $^{210}$Pb. Future prospects to\nsearch for dark matter by means of a large volume and high purity NaI(Tl)\nscintillator is discussed.\n", "  Wear resistant coatings were produced on a permanent mould cast MRI 230D Mg\nalloy by (a) PEO in silicate based electrolyte, (b) PEO in phosphate based\nelectrolyte, (c) hybrid coatings of silicate PEO followed by laser surface\nalloying (LSA) with Al and Al2O3, and (d) hybrid coatings of phosphate PEO\nfollowed by LSA with Al and Al2O3. Microstructural characterization of the\ncoatings was carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X(ray\ndiffraction. The tribological behavior of the coatings was investigated under\ndry sliding condition using linearly reciprocating ball-on-flat wear test. Both\nthe PEO coatings exhibited a friction coefficient of about 0.8 and hybrid\ncoatings exhibited a value of about 0.5 against the AISI 52100 steel ball as\nthe friction partner, which were slightly reduced with the increase in applied\nload. The PEO coatings sustained the test without failure at 2 N load but\nfailed at 5 N load due to micro-fracture caused by high contact stresses. The\nhybrid coatings did not get completely worn off at 2 N load but were completely\nremoved exposing the substrate at 5 N load. The PEO coatings exhibited better\nwear resistance than the hybrid coatings and silicate PEO coatings exhibited\nbetter wear resistance than the phosphate PEO coatings. Both the PEO coatings\nmelted/decomposed on laser irradiation and all the hybrid coatings exhibited\nsimilar microstructure and wear behavior irrespective of the nature of the\nprimary PEO coating or laser energies. SEM examination of worn surfaces\nindicated abrasive wear combined with adhesive wear for all the specimens. The\nsurface of the ball exhibited a discontinuous transfer layer after the wear\ntest.\n", "  We present GADRAD, a Python module that adopts heuristic search techniques in\nthe form of genetic algorithms, to efficiently model post-asymptotic giant\nbranch (post- AGB) disc environments. GADRAD systematically constructs the\nmulti-dimensional pa- parameter probability density functions that arise from\nthe fitting of radiative transfer and geometric models to optical\ninterferometric data products. The result provides unbiased descriptions of the\nobject's potential morphology, component luminosities and temperatures, dust\ncomposition, disc density profiles and mass. Correlation in the estimated\nparameters as well as potential degeneracies are revealed. Estimated\nprobability distributions of the post-AGB environment parameters provide\ninsight into the shaping processes that may occur in the transition from the\npost-AGB to the planetary nebula phase. We test parameter recovery on simulated\nartificial data products of a typical post-AGB environment. We then use GADRAD\nto model the mid-infrared spectrum and visibilities of the Ant nebula (Mz3),\ntaken with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer's instrument MIDI. Our\nresult is consistent with a large dusty disc with similar parameter values to\nthose previously found by Chesneau et al., except for a larger dust mass of\n$3.5^{+7.5}_{-2.2}\\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$. The parameter confidence\nintervals determined by GADRAD, can however be relied upon to impose additional\nconstraints on all disc and system parameters. Based on our analysis and other\nconsiderations, we tentatively suggest that Mz3 is a pre-PN ejected during a\nmagnetic (polar) common envelope interaction, where the binary may or may not\nhave survived at the core of the nebula.\n", "  We present coarse-grained simulation results for enhanced ion diffusion in a\ncharged nanopore grafted with ionomer sidechains. The pore surface is\nhydrophobic and its diameter is varied from 2.0 nm to 3.7 nm. The sidechains\nhave from 2 to 16 monomers (united atom units) and contain sulfonate terminal\ngroups.\n  Our simulation results indicate a strong dependence of the ion diffusion\nalong the pore axis on the pore parameters. In the case of short sidechains and\nlarge pores the ions mostly occupy the pore wall area, where their distribution\nis strongly disturbed by their host sulfonates. In the case of short sidechains\nand narrow pores, the mobility of ions is strongly affected by the structuring\nand polarization effects of the water molecules. In the case of long\nsidechains, and when the sidechain sulfonates reach the pore center, a radial\ncharge separation occurs in the pore. Such charge separation suppresses the ion\ndiffusion along the pore axis.\n  An enhanced ion diffusion was found in the pores grafted with medium-size\nsidechains provided that the ions do not enter the central pore area, and the\nwater is less structured around the ions and sulfonates. In this case, the 3D\ndensity of the ions has a hollow-cylinder type shape with a smooth and\nuninterrupted surface. We found that the maximal ion diffusion has a linear\ndependence on the number of sidechain monomers. It is suggested that the\nmaximal ion diffusion along the pore axis is attained if the effective length\nof the sidechain extension into the pore center (measured as twice the gyration\nradius of the sidechain with the Flory exponent 1/4) is about 1/3 of the pore\nradius.\n", "  The challenges of precision neutrino physics require measurements of absolute\nneutrino cross sections at the GeV scale with exquisite (1%) precision. This\nprecision is presently limited by the uncertainties on neutrino flux at the\nsource; their reduction by one order of magnitude can be achieved monitoring\nthe positron production in the decay tunnel originating from the $K_{e3}$\ndecays of charged kaons in a sign and momentum selected narrow band beam. This\nnovel technique enables the measurement of the most relevant cross sections for\nCP violation ($\\nu_e$ and $\\overline{\\nu}_e$) with a precision of 1% and\nrequires a special instrumented beam-line. Such non-conventional beam-line will\nbe developed in the framework of the ENUBET Horizon-2020 Consolidator Grant,\nrecently approved by the European Research Council. The project, the first\nexperimental results on ultra-compact calorimeters that can be embedded in the\ninstrumented decay tunnel and the advances on the simulation of the beamline\nare presented. We also discuss the detector and accelerator activities that are\nplanned in 2016-2021.\n", "  We use a kinetic condition to predict the chemical freeze-out parameters for\nhadronic species produced in heavy ion collisions. The resulting freeze-out\nlines for different hadrons lie close to one another in the temperature and\nbaryochemical potential plane, defining a universal, narrow region. The\nchemical freeze-out is driven by the localization of hadrons due to the chiral\nsymmetry breaking and confining aspects of the QCD transition.\n", "  Theories that are used to extract energy-landscape information from\nsingle-molecule pulling experiments in biophysics are all invariably based on\nKramers' theory of thermally-activated escape rate from a potential well. As is\nwell known, this theory recovers the Arrhenius dependence of the rate on the\nbarrier energy, and crucially relies on the assumption that the barrier energy\nis much larger than $k_{B}T$ (limit of comparatively low thermal fluctuations).\nAs was already shown in Dudko, Hummer, Szabo Phys. Rev. Lett. (2006), this\napproach leads to the unphysical prediction of dissociation time increasing\nwith decreasing binding energy when the latter is lowered to values comparable\nto $k_{B}T$ (limit of large thermal fluctuations). We propose a new theoretical\nframework (fully supported by numerical simulations) which amends Kramers'\ntheory in this limit, and use it to extract the dissociation rate from\nsingle-molecule experiments where now predictions are physically meaningful and\nin agreement with simulations over the whole range of applied forces (binding\nenergies). These results are expected to be relevant for a large number of\nexperimental settings in single-molecule biophysics.\n", "  In this paper, the effectiveness utilization of agriculture wastes and\nindustrial wastes in the composites cement has been studied in terms of\nphysical and mechanical properties. Twenty weight percent of fly ash and eighty\nweight percent of sand were added to the composite cement. The different weight\npercent of coconut fiber (3 wt. %, 6 wt. %, 9 wt. %, 12 wt. % and 15 wt. %) was\nadded in the composition as reinforcement for cement composites. Water to\ncement ratio ranging from 0.55 to 0.70 was added into the cement composites\naccordingly to maintain its workability. Then the cement composites were cured\nin water for 7, 14 and 28 days respectively. Results for physical properties\n(density, moisture content, water absorption) and mechanical properties\n(compressive strength, modulus of rupture) are presented.\n", "  We report an observation of room temperature magnetodielectric (RTMD) effect\nin Mn doped LaGaO3. Results of frequency dependent magnetoresistance (FDMR)\nmeasurements discards the possibility of any magnetoresistive contribution in\nthe observed MD effect. The intrinsic nature of MD coupling has been\nvalidated/evidenced by means of magnetic field dependent Raman spectroscopy and\nexplained in terms of modified volume strain governed by magnetic field induced\nrerotation of spin coupled Mn-orbitals. Ultimately, present RTMD effect is\nattributed to magneto-compression/magnetostriction associated with spin-phonon\ncoupling as evidenced in the form of magnetic field induced hardening of\nsymmetric stretching (SS) MnO6 octahedral Raman modes. Presently studied Mn\ndoped LaGaO3 can be a candidate for magnetodielectric applications.\n", "  The complex electric modulus and the ac conductivity of carbon\nnanoonion/polyaniline composites were studied from 1 mHz to 1 MHz at isothermal\nconditions ranging from 15 K to room temperature. The temperature dependence of\nthe electric modulus and the dc conductivity analyses indicate a couple of\nhopping mechanisms. The distinction between thermally activated processes and\nthe determination of cross-over temperature were achieved by exploring the\ntemperature dependence of the fractional exponent of the dispersive ac\nconductivity and the bifurcation of the scaled ac conductivity isotherms. The\nresults are analyzed by combining the granular metal model(inter-grain charge\ntunneling of extended electron states located within mesoscopic highly\nconducting polyaniline grains) and a 3D Mott variable range hopping model\n(phonon assisted tunneling within the carbon nano-onions and clusters).\n", "  We study the low-energy magnon spectrum of the skyrmion crystal (SkX) ground\nstate, appearing in two-dimensional ferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction and magnetic field. We approximate SkX hexagonal superlattice by a\nset of overlapping disks, and find the lattice period by minimizing the\nclassical energy density. The determined spectrum of magnons on the disc of\noptimal radius is stable and only two lowest energy levels can be considered as\nlocalized. The subsequent hybridization of these levels in the SkX lattice\nleads to tight-binding spectrum. The localized character of the lowest magnon\nstates is lost at small and at high fields, which is interpreted as melting of\nSkX. The classical energy of SkX is slightly above the energy of a single\nconical spiral, and a consideration of quantum corrections can favor the\nskyrmion ground state. Extending our analysis to three-dimensional case, we\nargue that these quantum corrections become more important at finite\ntemperatures, when the average spin value is decreased.\n", "  We report a computational study, using the \"moments method\" [Y. Gao and M.\nDaw, Modelling Simul. Mater. Sci. Eng. 23 045002 (2015)], of the anharmonicity\nof the vibrational modes of single-walled carbon nanotubes. We find that modes\nwith displacements largely within the wall are more anharmonic than modes with\ndominantly radial character, except for a set of modes that are related to the\nradial breathing mode which are the most anharmonic of all. We also find that\nperiodicity of the calculation along the tube length does not strongly affect\nthe anharmonicity of the modes, but that the tubes with larger diameter show\nmore anharmonicity. Comparison is made with available experiments and other\ncalculations.\n", "  We report a computational study of the anharmonicity of the vibrational modes\nof various individual fullerenes using the \"moments method\" [Y. Gao and M. Daw,\nModelling Simul. Mater. Sci. Eng. 23 045002 (2015)] with a Tersoff-style\npotential for carbon. We find that the frequencies of all vibrational modes\ndrop systematically with temperature and the sizes of the individual fullerenes\ndo not affect strongly the anharmonicity of the modes. Comparison is made with\navailable experiments.\n", "  We develop a novel next generation light-weight highly flexible pediatric\ncoil array, combine it with a high-density pediatric posterior array or\nconventional posterior phased array, and determine feasibility of pediatric\nclinical use. A highly flexible 16 element MRI receiver coil was constructed\nwith low-profile noise controlling preamplifiers that minimized reactive and\nresistive coupling. Element decoupling was assessed in flat and highly flexed\nstates. With IRB approval and informed consent and assent, 24 consecutive\nsubjects undergoing torso or extremity MRI were prospectively recruited. Care\nteam members were surveyed on preference for the coil versus conventional coils\nand diagnostic acceptability of the images was recorded. Confidence interval of\nproportion of diagnostic exams was calculated. The array without cable weighed\n480 grams, demonstrated good flexibility while maintaining element decoupling.\nThe coil was preferred by all nurses and anesthesiologists involved in the care\nof the patients. Technologists preferred the coil in 96 percent of cases, and\n23 of 24 exams were diagnostically adequate with 85 percent confidence interval\nof 90-100 percent. Light-weight highly flexible coil arrays can be constructed\nthat maintain element decoupling. Pediatric clinical image quality is likely to\nbe diagnostic, with acceptance by members of the care team.\n", "  In this note, we discuss recent updates to a previous scan for the Inert\nDoublet Model, a two Higgs doublet model with a dark matter candidate. We\nexplicitly show the inclusion of updated constraints on direct detection\nreduces the allowed parameter space significantly. We furthermore discuss the\nIDMS - an extension of the IDM with a complex singlet.\n", "  The present study reports interesting findings in regard to emotional arousal\nbased activities while listening to two Hindustani classical ragas of contrast\nemotion. EEG data was taken on 5 naive listeners while they listened to two\nragas Bahar and Mia ki Malhar which are conventionally known to portray\ncontrast emotions. The EEG data were analyzed with the help of two robust non\nlinear tools viz. Adaptive Fractal Analysis (AFA) and Detrended Fluctuation\nAnalysis (DFA). A comparative study of the Hurst Exponents obtained from the\ntwo methods have been shown which shows that DFA provides more rigorous results\ncompared to AFA when it comes to the scaling analysis of biosignal data. The\nresults and implications have been discussed in detail.\n", "  We simulate boron on Pb(110) surface by using ab initio evolutionary\nmethodology. Interestingly, the two-dimensional (2D) Dirac Pmmn boron can be\nformed because of good lattice matching. Unexpectedly, by increasing the\nthickness of 2D boron, a three-bonded graphene-like structure (P2_1/c boron)\nwas revealed to possess double anisotropic Dirac cones. It is 20 meV/atom lower\nin energy than the Pmmn structure, indicating the most stable 2D boron with\nparticular Dirac cones. The puckered structure of P2_1/c boron results in the\npeculiar Dirac cones, as well as substantial mechanical anisotropy. The\ncalculated Young's modulus is 320 GPa.nm along zigzag direction, which is\ncomparable with graphene.\n", "  The relationship of scientific knowledge development to technological\ndevelopment is widely recognized as one of the most important and complex\naspects of technological evolution. This paper adds to our understanding of the\nrelationship through use of a more rigorous structure for differentiating among\ntechnologies based upon technological domains (defined as consisting of the\nartifacts over time that fulfill a specific generic function using a specific\nbody of technical knowledge).\n", "  Following the method in Ref.(1), this paper introduces a fundamental\nLagrangian 1-form on the particle's coordinates, which determines the dynamics\nof all ions and electrons of the magnetized plasma with low-frequency magnetic\nperturbations. An Ampere-Vlasov model is utilized to model this fundamental\nLagrangian 1-form based on a kind of coarse-grained scheme. With the\nCary-Littlejohn single-parameter Lie transform method, a new fundamental\nLagrangian 1-form on the gyrocenter coordinates is derived through transforming\nthe one on particle's coordinates. This new 1-form determines the dynamics of\nall ions and electrons on the gyrocenter coordinates. A new Ampere-Vlasov model\ntotally defined on the gyrocenter coordinates is developed to model the new\nLagrangian 1-form. By incorporating the electrostatic perturbation into the\nLagrangian 1-form, we eventually derived an Ampere-Poisson-Vlasov model defined\non the gyrocenter coordinates.\n", "  Planetary nebulae are traditionally considered to represent the final\nevolutionary stage of all intermediate-mass stars ($\\sim$0.7-8Msol). Recent\nevidence seems to contradict this picture. In particular, since the launch of\nthe Hubble Space Telescope it has become clear that planetary nebulae display a\nwide range of striking morphologies which cannot be understood in a single star\nscenario, instead pointing towards a binary evolution in a majority of systems.\nHere, we summarise our current understanding of the importance of binarity in\nthe formation and shaping of planetary nebulae, as well as the surprises that\nrecent observational studies have revealed with respect to our understanding of\nbinary evolution in general. These advances have critical implications,\nincluding for the understanding of mass transfer processes in binary stars -\nparticularly the all-important but ever-so poorly understood `common envelope\nphase' - as well as the formation of cosmologically important type Ia\nsupernovae.\n", "  We obtain a new set of analytical solutions for the evolution of a\nself-gravitating accretion disc by holding the Toomre parameter close to its\nthreshold, and obtaining the stress parameter from the cooling rate. In\nagreement with the previous numerical solutions, furthermore, the accretion\nrate is assumed to be independent of the disc radius. Extreme situations where\nthe entire disc is either optically thick or optically thin are studied\nindependently and the obtained solutions can be used for exploring the early or\nthe final phases of a protoplanetary disc evolution. Our solutions exhibit\ndecay of the accretion rate as a power-law function of the age of the system\nwith the exponent -0.75 and -1.04 for optically thick and thin cases,\nrespectively. Our calculations permit us to explore evolution of the snow line\nanalytically. Location of the snow line in the optically thick regime evolves\nas a power-law function of time with the exponent -0.16, however, when the disc\nis optically thin, location of the snow line as a function of time with the\nexponent -0.7 has a stronger dependence on time. It means that in an optically\nthin disc inward migration of the snow line is faster than an optically thick\ndisc.\n", "  AdS/CFT is a conjectured equivalence between a field theory without gravity\n(conformal field theory) and a string theory in a special curved background\n(anti de-Sitter space), where theories on both sides of the equivalence is\nsupersymmetric. Since the nature as we observe at low energy is\nnon-supersymmetric, it will be very useful if we can have this conjecture in\nthe non-supersymmetric case. Here we will give some evidence that AdS/CFT type\nduality must work for non-supersymmetric system. We will indicate some\ncalculation which leads us to such conclusion.\n", "  We first revisit the multi-allelic mutation-fitness balance problem,\nespecially when mutations obey a house of cards condition, where the\ndiscrete-time deterministic evolutionary dynamics of the allelic frequencies\nderives from a Shahshahani potential. We then consider multi-allelic\nWright-Fisher stochastic models whose deviation to neutrality is from the\nShahsha-hani mutation/selection potential. We next focus on the weak selection,\nweak mutation cases and, making use of a Gamma calculus, we compute the\nnormalizing partition functions of the invariant probability densities\nappearing in their Wright-Fisher diffusive approximations. Using these results,\nGeneralized Ewens sampling formulae (ESF) from the equilibrium distributions\nare derived. We start treating the ESF in the mixed mutation/selection\npotential case and then we restrict ourselves to the ESF in the simpler\nhouse-of-cards mutations only situation. We also address some issues concerning\nsampling problems from infinitely-many alleles weak limits.\n", "  Recently, a number of nonlocal integrable equations, such as the PT-symmetric\nnonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation and PT-symmetric Davey-Stewartson\nequations, were proposed and studied. Here we show that many of such nonlocal\nintegrable equations can be converted to local integrable equations through\nsimple variable transformations. Examples include these nonlocal NLS and\nDavey-Stewartson equations, a nonlocal derivative NLS equation, the reverse\nspace-time complex modified Korteweg-de Vries (CMKdV) equation, and many\nothers. These transformations not only establish immediately the integrability\nof these nonlocal equations, but also allow us to construct their analytical\nsolutions from solutions of the local equations. These transformations can also\nbe used to derive new nonlocal integrable equations. As applications of these\ntransformations, we use them to derive rogue wave solutions for the partially\nPT-symmetric Davey-Stewartson equations and the nonlocal derivative NLS\nequation. In addition, we use them to derive multi-soliton and quasi-periodic\nsolutions in the reverse space-time CMKdV equation. Furthermore, we use them to\nconstruct many new nonlocal integrable equations such as nonlocal short pulse\nequations, nonlocal nonlinear diffusion equations, and nonlocal Sasa-Satsuma\nequations.\n", "  We investigate the stability of the solutions of the BCS model with the\nexternal pair potential formulated in a work K.V. Grigorishin arXiv:1605.07080.\nIt has been shown that the cause of superconductivity in this model is the\nelectron-electron interaction only and the potential cannot impose\nsuperconductivity since the superconducting ordering will be destroyed by phase\nfluctuations in a form of quantum turbulence (vortexes, vortex rings, vortex\ntangles etc.). The external pair potential renormalizes the order parameter in\ninitial superconducting matter and the bosonic scenario of transition to normal\nstate in a clear 3D superconductor occurs unlike BCS theory where the fermionic\nscenario takes place.\n", "  The influence of superheat treatment on the microstructure and dynamic\nmechanical properties of A357 alloys has been investigated. The study of\nmicrostructure was performed by the optical microscope. Dynamic mechanical\nproperties (storage modulus, loss modulus, and damping capacity) were measured\nby the dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA). Microstructure showed coarser and\nangular eutectic Si particles with larger {\\alpha}-Al dendrites in the\nnon-superheated A357 alloy. In contrast, finer and rounded eutectic Si\nparticles together with smaller and preferred oriented {\\alpha}-Al dendrites\nhave been observed in the superheated A357 alloy. Dynamic mechanical properties\nshowed an increasing trend of loss modulus and damping capacity meanwhile a\ndecreasing trend of storage modulus at elevated temperatures for superheated\nand non-superheated A357 alloys. The high damping capacity of superheated A357\nhas been ascribed to the grain boundary damping at elevated temperatures.\n", "  The MiniBooNE experiment reported results from the analysis of $\\nu_e$ and\n$\\overline{\\nu}_e$ appearance searches, which showed an excess of signal-like\nevents at low reconstructed neutrino energies with respect to the expected\nbackground. A proposed explanation for this anomaly is based on the existence\nof a heavy ($\\sim 50$~MeV) sterile neutrino. These $\\nu_h$ would be produced by\n$\\nu_\\mu$ electromagnetic and neutral current interactions. A fraction of them\ndecays radiatively inside the detector. The emitted photon is misidentified as\nan electron or positron in MiniBooNE. We have investigated the $\\nu_h$\nproduction by coherent and incoherent electroweak interactions at the MiniBooNE\nand MicroBooNE targets, CH$_2$ and Ar, respectively. Studying the $\\nu_h$\npropagation inside the detector, we obtain the energy and angular distributions\nof emitted photons for a choice of model parameters. The distinctive shape and\ntotal number of photon events from this mechanism at MicroBooNE makes its\nexperimental investigation possible.\n", "  SNO+ is a neutrinoless double beta decay and low energy neutrino experiment\nlocated in Sudbury, Canada. To improve our understanding of the detector energy\nresolution and systematics, calibration systems have been developed to\ncontinuously monitor the optical properties of the detector, such as:\nabsorption, re-emission, scattering and timing. A part of this in-situ optical\ncalibration system is the Embedded LED/Laser Light Injection Entity (ELLIE). It\nconsists of three subsystems: AMELLIE, SMELLIE, TELLIE. The attenuation module\n(AMELLIE) is designed to monitor the total optical attenuation, whereas the\noptical scattering over a wavelength range of 375nm -- 700nm will be\ncharacterized by the scattering module (SMELLIE). The timing module (TELLIE)\naims to measure the timing characteristics of the photomultiplier tubes. We\npresent the planned commissioning of these three systems, the running of which\nbegan early 2017.\n", "  CMS-HF Calorimeters have been undergoing a major upgrade for the last couple\nof years to alleviate the problems encountered during Run I, especially in the\nPMT and the readout systems. In this poster, the problems caused by the old\nPMTs installed in the detectors and their solutions will be explained.\nInitially, regular PMTs with thicker windows, causing large Cherenkov\nradiation, were used. Instead of the light coming through the fibers from the\ndetector, stray muons passing through the PMT itself produce Cherenkov\nradiation in the PMT window, resulting in erroneously large signals. Usually,\nlarge signals are the result of very high-energy particles in the calorimeter\nand are tagged as important. As a result, these so-called window events\ngenerate false triggers. Four-anode PMTs with thinner windows were selected to\nreduce these window events. Additional channels also help eliminate such\nremaining events through algorithms comparing the output of different PMT\nchannels. During the EYETS 16/17 period in the LHC operations, the final\ncomponents of the modifications to the readout system, namely the two-channel\nfront-end electronics cards, are installed. Complete upgrade of the HF\nCalorimeter, including the preparations for the Run II will be discussed in\nthis poster, with possible effects on the eventual data taking.\n", "  We advance Machine Learning Control (MLC), a recently proposed model-free\ncontrol framework which explores and exploits strongly nonlinear dynamics in an\nunsupervised manner. The assumed plant has multiple actuators and sensors and\nits performance is measured by a cost functional. The control problem is to\nfind a control logic which optimizes the given cost function. The corresponding\nregression problem for the control law is solved by employing linear genetic\nprogramming as an easy and simple regression solver in a high-dimensional\ncontrol search space. This search space comprises open-loop actuation,\nsensor-based feedback and combinations thereof, thus generalizing former MLC\nstudies. This methodology is denoted as linear genetic programming control\n(LGPC). Focus of this study is the frequency crosstalk between unforced\nunstable oscillation and the actuation at different frequencies. LGPC is first\napplied to the stabilization of a forced nonlinearly coupled three-oscillator\nmodel comprising open- and closed-loop frequency crosstalk mechanisms. LGPC\nperformance is then demonstrated in a turbulence control experiment, achieving\n22% drag reduction for a simplified car model. For both cases, LGPC identifies\nthe best nonlinear control achieving the optimal performance by exploiting\nfrequency crosstalk. Our control strategy is suited to complex control problems\nwith multiple actuators and sensors featuring nonlinear actuation dynamics.\n", "  In this summary of my talk at Strings 2016, I explain how classical dynamics\non an infinite tree graph can be dual to a conformal field theory defined over\nthe $p$-adic numbers. An informal introduction to $p$-adic numbers is followed\nby a presentation of results on holographic three- and four-point functions.\nThe simplicity of $p$-adic field theories and their similarity to ordinary\nfield theories are illustrated through comparisons of holographic correlators\nand computations of simple loop diagrams on the field theory side. I close with\na discussion of challenges and directions for future work.\n", "  Recent availability of high quality infrared (IR) data for diffuse regions in\nthe Galaxy and external galaxies have added to our understanding of\ninterstellar dust. A comparison of ultraviolet (UV) and IR observations may be\nused to estimate absorption, scattering and thermal emission from interstellar\ndust. In this paper, we report IR and UV observations for selective diffuse\nsources in the Galaxy. Using archival mid-infrared (MIR) and far-infrared (FIR)\nobservations from Spitzer Space Telescope, we look for counterparts of diffuse\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) sources observed by the Voyager, Far Ultraviolet\nSpectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) telescopes\nin the Galaxy. IR emission features at 8micron are generally attributed to\nPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules, while emission at 24micron are\nattributed to Very Small Grains (VSGs). The data presented here is unique and\nour study tries to establish a relation between various dust populations. By\nstudying the FUV-IR correlations separately at low and high latitude locations,\nwe have identified the grain component responsible for the diffuse FUV\nemission.\n", "  We propose two schemes to generate four-photon polarization-entangled states\nfrom the second-order emission of the spontaneous parametric down-conversion\nprocess. By using linear optical elements and the coincidence-detection, the\nfour indistinguishable photons emitted from parametric down-conversion source\nresult in the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state or the superposition of\ntwo orthogonal GHZ states. For this superposition state, under particular phase\nsettings we analyze the quantum correlation function and the local hidden\nvariable (LHV) correlation. As a result, the Bell inequality derived from the\nLHV correlation is violated with the visibility larger than 0.442. It means\nthat the present four-photon entangled state is therefore suitable for testing\nthe LHV theory.\n", "  Classical and quantum annealing are two heuristic optimization methods that\nsearch for an optimal solution by slowly decreasing thermal or quantum\nfluctuations. Optimizing annealing schedules is important both for performance\nand fair comparisons between classical annealing, quantum annealing, and other\nalgorithms. Here we present a heuristic approach for the optimization of\nannealing schedules for quantum annealing and apply it to 3D Ising spin glass\nproblems. We find that if both classical and quantum annealing schedules are\nsimilarly optimized, classical annealing outperforms quantum annealing for\nthese problems when considering the residual energy obtained in slow annealing.\nHowever, when performing many repetitions of fast annealing, simulated quantum\nannealing is seen to outperform classical annealing for our benchmark problems.\n", "  We study the KMS states and $KMS_{\\infty}$ states of generalized gauge\nactions on the $C^*$-algebra of a pointed Cayley graph. Our results provide\ninformation for any finitely generated group, but they are only complete for\nnilpotent groups.\n", "  We study the possibility of the spinodal decomposition in the induction\nperiod of the polymer crystallization. This phenomenon was first reported in an\nX-ray scattering experiment, and has still been controversial due to various\nexperiments and theories that support or deny the phenomenon. In this article,\nwe explain the condition for the spinodal decomposition to occur in polymer\nmelts by deriving a Ginzburg-Landau model of the free energy as a functional of\nthe density and the orientation of the segments, where we introduce the\nexcluded volume and the nematic interactions through a combination of the\nrandom phase approximation and the transfer matrix for the polymer\nconformation. We show that, upon elimination of the degrees of freedom of the\norientation, the nematic interaction reduces to an effective attraction whose\nstrength increases with the stiffness of the polymer chain. Such an attraction\ninduces spinodal decomposion especially for stiff polymer chain case.\n", "  Bose-Einstein condensate of exciton polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity\nis a macroscopically populated coherent quantum state subject to concurrent\npumping and decay. Debates about the fundamental nature of the condensed phase\nin this open quantum system still persist. Here, we gain a new insight into the\nspontaneous condensation process by imaging long-lifetime exciton polaritons in\na high-quality inorganic microcavity in the single-shot optical excitation\nregime, without averaging over multiple condensate realisations. In this highly\nnon-stationary regime, a condensate is strongly influenced by the `hot'\nincoherent reservoir, and reservoir depletion is critical for the transition to\nthe ground energy and momentum state. Condensates formed by more photonic\nexciton polaritons exhibit dramatic reservoir-induced density filamentation and\nshot-to-shot fluctuations. In contrast, condensates of more excitonic\nquasiparticles display smooth density and are second-order coherent. Our\nobservations show that the single-shot measurements offer a unique opportunity\nto study formation of macroscopic phase coherence during a quantum phase\ntransition in a solid state system.\n", "  In the work presented here, we have studied the impact of right handed\nneutrinos, which are introduced to account for the evidence of neutrino masses,\non charged lepton flavour violating observables. In particular, we have focused\non the loop induced decays of the Z boson into two leptons of different\nflavour. We have performed a numerical study of the rates predicted for these\nprocesses within the Inverse Seesaw model, specifically considering scenarios\nwhere $ \\mu -e $ transitions are suppressed. Our conclusion, after comparison\nwith the most relevant experimental constraints, is that branching ratios as\nlarge as $ 10^{-7} $ can be predicted in the $ \\tau -\\mu $ or $ \\tau -e $\nchannels, together with heavy neutrinos having masses of the TeV order. Such\nrates could be accessible at next generation colliders.\n", "  The interplay between cosmology and earth based experiments is crucial in\norder to pin down neutrino physics. Indeed cosmology can provide very tight,\nyet model dependent, constraints on some neutrino properties. Here we focus on\nthe neutrino mass sum, reviewing the up to date current bounds and showing the\nresults of our forecast of the sensitivity of future experiments. Finally, we\ndiscuss the case for sterile neutrinos, explaining how non standard sterile\nneutrino self-interactions can reconcile the oscillation anomalies with\ncosmology.\n", "  We prove in the multimode scenario a fundamental relation between the Wehrl\nand the von Neumann entropy, stating that the minimum Wehrl entropy among all\nthe quantum states with a given von Neumann entropy is achieved by thermal\nGaussian states. We also prove that thermal Gaussian input states minimize the\noutput von Neumann entropy of multimode quantum Gaussian attenuators,\namplifiers and phase-contravariant channels among all the input states diagonal\nin some product basis and with a given entropy. This result constitutes a major\nstep towards the proof of the same property for generic input states, which is\nstill an open conjecture. This conjecture is necessary to determine the maximum\ncommunication rates for the triple trade-off coding and broadcast communication\nwith the Gaussian quantum-limited attenuator. Finally, we prove that the tensor\nproduct of n identical geometric input probability distributions minimizes the\noutput Shannon entropy of the n-mode thinning among all the input probability\ndistributions with a given entropy.\n", "  We present a hydrodynamic model of spreading epithelial monolayers as polar\nviscous fluids, with active contractility and traction on the substrate. The\ncombination of both active forces generate an instability that leads to\nnonlinear traveling waves, which propagate in the direction of polarity with\ncharacteristic time scales that depend on contact forces. We show that a\nviscous fluid model explains a variety of observations on the slow dynamics of\nepithelial monolayers, in particular those that had been interpreted before as\nsignatures of elasticity. The non-elastic nature of the waves can be tested on\nthe basis of simple predictions of the model. Our theoretical framework\nprovides new insights such as the interpretation of plithotaxis as a result of\na strong flow-polarity coupling, and the quantification of collective\nforce-transmission of cells in terms of the non-locality of interactions. In\naddition, we study the nonlinear regime of those waves deriving an exact map of\nthe model into the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, which provides a complete\nclassification of possible nonlinear scenarios. In particular, we predict the\ntransition to different forms of weak turbulence, which in turn could explain\nthe very unstable and irregular dynamics often observed in epithelia.\n", "  The groundwater flow system in the Culebra Dolomite Member (Culebra) of the\nPermian Rustler Formation is a potential radionuclide release pathway from the\nWaste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), the only deep geological repository for\ntransuranic waste in the United States. In early conceptual models of the\nCulebra, groundwater levels were not expected to fluctuate markedly, except in\nresponse to long-term climatic changes, with response times on the order of\nhundreds to thousands of years. Recent groundwater pressures measured in\nmonitoring wells record more than 25 m of drawdown. The fluctuations are\nattributed to pumping activities at a privately-owned well that may be\nassociated with the demand of the Permian Basin hydrocarbon industry for water.\nThe unprecedented magnitude of drawdown provides an opportunity to\nquantitatively assess the influence of unplanned anthropogenic forcings near\nthe WIPP. Spatially variable realizations of Culebra saturated hydraulic\nconductivity and storativity were used to develop groundwater flow models to\nestimate a pumping rate for the private well and investigate its effect on\nadvective transport. Simulated drawdown shows reasonable agreement with\nobservations (average Model Efficiency coefficient = 0.7). Steepened hydraulic\ngradients associated with the pumping reduce estimates of conservative particle\ntravel times across the domain by one-half and shift the intersection of the\naverage particle track with the compliance boundary by more than two\nkilometers. The value of the transient simulations conducted for this study lie\nin their ability to (i) improve understanding of the Culebra groundwater flow\nsystem and (ii) challenge the notion of time-invariant land use in the vicinity\nof the WIPP.\n", "  Flavons are crucial for understanding lepton mixing in models with\nnon-Abelian discrete symmetries. They also result in charged lepton flavour\nviolation (CLFV) via the couplings with leptons. I emphasise that the\nflavon-triggered CLFV succeeds strong connections with lepton flavour mixing.\nRelations between branching ratios of CLFV decays and mixing angles are\ndiscussed, and CLFV sum rules are obtained. Flavons with masses around hundreds\nof GeV are consistent by current CLFV measurements.\n", "  Adsorption is one important way applied to water decontamination, where\ncarbon is commonly used as highly effective absorbent. Carbon of different\nmorphologies and structures normally demonstrate distinct capabilities to\nadsorption-typed decontaminations. Graphene oxide is regarded as the oxidative\nderivative of graphene, maintaining its 2D morphology-featuring structure while\nlocation-dependently immobilized with a large amount of various\noxygen-involving functional moieties on both sides. Free-standing graphene\noxide tends to fully unfold in water and behave in macromolecular-like Brownian\nmotion. Therefore, high-performance adsorption occurs during the process of\ninteracting with large amount of sorbates, during which an unevenness of\neffective adsorptive site distribution turns out for targeted matter due to\nfunctional group-to-sorbate interaction mechanism differentiation as well as\ngroups'inherent location specifications. Thus, oriented manipulation of\nsurficial functional moieties and their site distribution is potentially a way\nto further enhance the adsorptive performances, and this could go even better\nif considering combining adsorption and an in-situ manipulation at the same\ntime.\n", "  Zinc oxide and Aluminum Ferrite were prepared Chemical route. The samples\nwere characterized by XRD and VSM. Simulation of M-H plots of Co/CoO thin films\nwere performed. Effect of parameters was observed on saturation magnetization.\n", "  It is reported on growth of mm-sized single-crystals of the low-dimensional S\n= 1/2 spin compound Cu6(Ge,Si)6O18.6H2O by a diffusion technique in aqueous\nsolution. A route to form Si-rich crystals down to possibly dioptase, the pure\nsilicate, is discussed. Further, the assignment of dd excitations from UV-VIS\nspectra of the hexahydrate and the fully dehydrated compound is proposed in\ncomparison to dioptase and selected Cu(II) oxo-compounds using bond strength\nconsiderations. Non-doped cuprates as layer compounds show higher excitation\nenergies than the title compound. However, when the antiferromagnetic\ninteraction energy as Jzln(2) is taken into account for cuprates, a single\nlinear relationship between the Dqe excitation energy and equatorial Cu(II)-O\nbond strength is confirmed for all compounds. A linear representation is also\nconfirmed between 2A1g energies and a function of axial and equatorial Cu-O\nbond distances, when auxiliary axial bonds are used for four-coordinated\ncompounds. The quotient Dt/Ds of experimental orbital energies deviating from\nthe general trend to smaller values indicates the existence of H2O respectively\nCl1- axial ligands in comparison to oxo-ligands, whereas larger Dt/Dqe values\nindicate missing axial bonds. The quotient of the excitation energy 2A1g by\n2x2Eg-2B2g allows to check for correctness of the assignment and to distinguish\nbetween axial oxo-ligands and others like H2O or Cl1-. Some assignments\npreviously reported were corrected.\n", "  Nonlinear dynamics on graphs has rapidly become a topical issue with many\nphysical applications, ranging from nonlinear optics to Bose-Einstein\ncondensation. Whenever in a physical experiment a ramified structure is\ninvolved, it can prove useful to approximate such a structure by a metric\ngraph, or network. For the Schroedinger equation it turns out that the sixth\npower in the nonlinear term of the energy is critical in the sense that below\nthat power the constrained energy is lower bounded irrespectively of the value\nof the mass (subcritical case). On the other hand, if the nonlinearity power\nequals six, then the lower boundedness depends on the value of the mass: below\na critical mass, the constrained energy is lower bounded, beyond it, it is not.\nFor powers larger than six the constrained energy functional is never lower\nbounded, so that it is meaningless to speak about ground states (supercritical\ncase). These results are the same as in the case of the nonlinear Schrodinger\nequation on the real line. In fact, as regards the existence of ground states,\nthe results for systems on graphs differ, in general, from the ones for systems\non the line even in the subcritical case: in the latter case, whenever the\nconstrained energy is lower bounded there always exist ground states (the\nsolitons, whose shape is explicitly known), whereas for graphs the existence of\na ground state is not guaranteed. For the critical case, our results show a\nphenomenology much richer than the analogous on the line.\n", "  Conventional wireless power transfer systems consist of a microwave power\ngenerator and transmitter located at one place and a microwave power receiver\nlocated at a distance. Here we show that wireless power transfer can be\nrealized as a single distributed microwave generator with an over-the-air\nfeedback, so that the microwave power is generated directly at the place where\nthe energy needs to be delivered. We demonstrate that the use of this paradigm\nincreases efficiency and dramatically reduces sensitivity to misalignments,\nvariations in load and power, and possible presence of obstacles between the\nsource and receiver.\n", "  Low-profile patterned plasmonic surfaces are synergized with a broad class of\nsilicon microstructures to greatly enhance near-field nanoscale imaging,\nsensing, and energy harvesting coupled with far-field free-space detection.\nThis concept has a clear impact on several key areas of interest for the MEMS\ncommunity, including but not limited to ultra-compact microsystems for\nsensitive detection of small number of target molecules, and surface devices\nfor optical data storage, micro-imaging and displaying. In this paper, we\nreview the current state-of-the-art in plasmonic theory as well as derive\ndesign guidance for plasmonic integration with microsystems, fabrication\ntechniques, and selected applications in biosensing, including refractive-index\nbased label-free biosensing, plasmonic integrated lab-on-chip systems,\nplasmonic near-field scanning optical microscopy and plasmonics on-chip systems\nfor cellular imaging. This paradigm enables low-profile conformal surfaces on\nmicrodevices, rather than bulk material or coatings, which provide clear\nadvantages for physical, chemical and biological-related sensing, imaging, and\nlight harvesting, in addition to easier realization, enhanced flexibility, and\ntunability.\n", "  In this paper, global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) have been applied to the problem of natural convection (NC)\nin a porous square cavity. This problem is widely used to provide physical\ninsights into the processes of fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media. It\nintroduces however several parameters whose values are usually uncertain. We\nherein explore the effect of the imperfect knowledge of the system parameters\nand their variability on the model quantities of interest (QoIs) characterizing\nthe NC mechanisms. To this end, we use GSA in conjunction with the polynomial\nchaos expansion (PCE) methodology. In particular, GSA is performed using Sobol'\nsensitivity indices. Moreover, the probability distributions of the QoIs\nassessing the flow and heat transfer are obtained by performing UQ using PCE as\na surrogate of the original computational model. The results demonstrate that\nthe temperature distribution is mainly controlled by the longitudinal thermal\ndispersion coefficient. The variability of the average Nusselt number is\ncontrolled by the Rayleigh number and transverse dispersion coefficient. The\nvelocity field is mainly sensitive to the Rayleigh number and permeability\nanisotropy ratio. The heterogeneity slightly affects the heat transfer in the\ncavity and has a major effect on the flow patterns. The methodology presented\nin this work allows performing in-depth analyses in order to provide relevant\ninformation for the interpretation of a NC problem in porous media at low\ncomputational costs.\n", "  The sciences of complexity present some recurrent themes: the emergence of\nqualitatively new behaviors in dissipative systems out of equilibrium, the\naparent tendency of complex system to lie at the border of phase transitions\nand bifurcation points, a historical dynamics which present punctuated\nequilibrium, a tentative of complementing Darwinian evolution with certain\nideas of progress (understood as increase of computational power) etc. Such\nthemes, indeed, belong to a long scientific and philosophical tradiction and,\ncuriously, appear already in the work of Frederick Engels at the 70's of the\nXIX century. So, the apparent novelity of the sciences of complexity seems to\nbe not situated in its fundamental ideas, but in the use of mathematical and\ncomputational models for illustrate, test and develop such ideas. Since\npoliticians as the candidate Al Gore recently declared that the sciences of\ncomplexity have influenced strongly their worldview, perhaps it could be\ninteresting to know better the ideas and the ideology related to the notion of\ncomplex adaptive systems.\n"]}
