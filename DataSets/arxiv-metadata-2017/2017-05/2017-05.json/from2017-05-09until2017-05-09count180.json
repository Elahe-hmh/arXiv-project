We\nreport on SETs made by registered in-plane growth utilizing tailored nanoscale\ncatalyst patterns and chemical vapor deposition. Metallic SWCNTs have been\nremoved by an electrical burn-in technique and the common gate hysteresis was\nremoved using PMMA and baking, leading to field effect transistors with large\non/off ratios up to 10^5. Further segmentation into 200 nm short semiconducting\nSWCNT devices created quantum dots which display conductance oscillations in\nthe Coulomb blockade regime. The demonstrated utilization of registered\nin-plane growth opens possibilities to create novel SET device geometries which\nare more complex, i.e. laterally ordered and scalable, as required for advanced\nquantum electronic devices.\n", "  This paper proposes a neuronal circuitry layout and synaptic plasticity\nprinciples that allow the (pyramidal) neuron to act as a \"combinatorial\nswitch\". Namely, the neuron learns to be more prone to generate spikes given\nthose combinations of firing input neurons for which a previous spiking of the\nneuron had been followed by a positive global reward signal. The reward signal\nmay be mediated by certain modulatory hormones or neurotransmitters, e.g., the\ndopamine. More generally, a trial-and-error learning paradigm is suggested in\nwhich a global reward signal triggers long-term enhancement or weakening of a\nneuron's spiking response to the preceding neuronal input firing pattern. Thus,\nrewards provide a feedback pathway that informs neurons whether their spiking\nwas beneficial or detrimental for a particular input combination. The neuron's\nability to discern specific combinations of firing input neurons is achieved\nthrough a random or predetermined spatial distribution of input synapses on\ndendrites that creates synaptic clusters that represent various permutations of\ninput neurons. The corresponding dendritic segments, or the enclosed individual\nspines, are capable of being particularly excited, due to local sigmoidal\nthresholding involving voltage-gated channel conductances, if the segment's\nexcitatory and absence of inhibitory inputs are temporally coincident. Such\nnonlinear excitation corresponds to a particular firing combination of input\nneurons, and it is posited that the excitation strength encodes the\ncombinatorial memory and is regulated by long-term plasticity mechanisms. It is\nalso suggested that the spine calcium influx that may result from the\nspatiotemporal synaptic input coincidence may cause the spine head actin\nfilaments to undergo mechanical (muscle-like) contraction, with the ensuing\ncytoskeletal deformation transmitted to the axon initial segment where it\nmay...\n", "  We report on a search for heavy neutrinos in B-meson decays. The results are\nobtained using a data sample that contains 772x10^6 BB-bar pairs collected at\nthe Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy\ne+e- collider. No signal is observed and upper limits are set on mixing of\nheavy neutrinos with left-handed neutrinos of the Standard Model in the mass\nrange 0.5 - 5.0 GeV/c^2.\n", "  It has been hypothesized that the rather small number of crossings in real\nsyntactic dependency trees is a side-effect of pressure for dependency length\nminimization. Here we answer a related important research question: what would\nbe the expected number of crossings if the natural order of a sentence was lost\nand replaced by a random ordering? We show that this number depends only on the\nnumber of vertices of the dependency tree (the sentence length) and the second\nmoment about zero of vertex degrees. The expected number of crossings is\nminimum for a star tree (crossings are impossible) and maximum for a linear\ntree (the number of crossings is of the order of the square of the sequence\nlength).\n", "  The bright exciton emission of semiconducting carbon nanotubes is appealing\nfor optoelectronic and quantum photonic devices as well as fundamental studies\nof light-matter interaction in one-dimensional nanostructures. The photophysics\nof excitons in carbon nanotubes till date is however largely affected by\nextrinsic effects of the dielectric environment. Here we carried out\ntime-resolved photoluminescence measurements over 14 orders of magnitude for\nultra-clean carbon nanotubes bridging an airgap over pillar posts. Our\nmeasurements demonstrate a new regime of intrinsic exciton photophysics with\nprolonged spontaneous emission times up to T1=18 ns, between one to two orders\nof magnitude better than prior measurements and in agreement with values first\nhypothesized by theorists about a decade ago. Further we establish for the\nfirst time the exciton decoherence times of individual nanotubes in the\ntime-domain and found four-fold prolonged values up to T2=2.1 ps compared to\nensemble measurements. These first observations motivate new discussions about\nthe magnitude of the intrinsic dephasing mechanism while the prolonged exciton\ndynamics is promising for device applications.\n", "  We recover some recent results by Dotsenko, Shadrin and Vallette on the\nDeligne groupoid of a pre-Lie algebra, showing that they follow naturally by a\npre-Lie variant of the PBW Theorem. As an application, we show that Kapranov's\n$L_\\infty$ algebra structure on the Dolbeault complex of a K\\\"ahler manifold is\nhomotopy abelian and independent on the choice of K\\\"ahler metric up to an\n$L_\\infty$ isomorphism, by making the trivializing homotopy and the $L_\\infty$\nisomorphism explicit.\n", "  Whenever several quantum light emitters are brought in proximity with one\nanother, their interaction with common electromagnetic fields couples them,\ngiving rise to cooperative shifts in their resonance frequency. Such collective\nline shifts are central to modern atomic physics, being closely related to\nsuperradiance on one hand and the Lamb shift on the other. Although collective\nshifts have been theoretically predicted more than fifty years ago, the effect\nhas not been observed yet in a controllable system of a few isolated emitters.\nHere, we report a direct spectroscopic observation of the cooperative shift of\nan optical electric dipole transition in a system of up to eight Sr ions\nsuspended in a Paul trap. We study collective resonance shift in the previously\nunexplored regime of far-field coupling, and provide the first observation of\ncooperative effects in an array of quantum emitters. These results pave the way\ntowards experimental exploration of cooperative emission phenomena in\nmesoscopic systems.\n", "  This is the handbook for the KONECT project, the \\emph{Koblenz Network\nCollection}, a scientific project to collect, analyse, and provide network\ndatasets for researchers in all related fields of research, by the Namur Center\nfor Complex Systems (naXys) at the University of Namur, Belgium, with web\nhosting provided by the Institute for Web Science and Technologies (WeST) at\nthe University of Koblenz--Landau, Germany.\n", "  Is it possible to identify individuals who are highly central in a community\nwithout gathering any network information, simply by asking a few people? If we\nuse people's nominees as seeds for a diffusion process, will it be successful?\nWe explore these questions theoretically, via surveys, and via field\nexperiments. We show via a model of information flow how members of a community\ncan, just by tracking gossip about others, identify highly central individuals\nin their network. Asking villagers in rural Indian villages to name good seeds\nfor diffusion, we find that they accurately nominate those who are central\naccording to a measure tailored for diffusion - not just those with many\nfriends or in powerful positions. Finally, we run a randomized field experiment\nin 213 other villages that tests how effective it is to use such nominations as\nseeds for a diffusion process. Relative to random seeds or those with high\nsocial status, hitting at least one seed nominated by villagers leads to more\nthan a 65% increase in the spread of information.\n", "  We investigate linearized gauge theories on globally hyperbolic spacetimes in\nthe BRST formalism. A consistent definition of the classical phase space and of\nits Cauchy surface analogue is proposed. We prove that it is isomorphic to the\nphase space in the subsidiary condition approach of Hack and Schenkel in the\ncase of Maxwell, Yang-Mills, and Rarita-Schwinger fields. Defining Hadamard\nstates in the BRST formalism in a standard way, their existence in the Maxwell\nand Yang-Mills case is concluded from known results in the subsidiary condition\n(or Gupta-Bleuler) formalism. Within our framework, we also formulate criteria\nfor non-degeneracy of the phase space in terms of BRST cohomology and discuss\nspecial cases. These include an example in the Yang-Mills case, where\ndegeneracy is not related to a non-trivial topology of the Cauchy surface.\n", "  In this paper we introduce and analyze a new system design for\nquantum-dot-based qubits that simultaneously supports scalable one-qubit and\ntwo-qubit gates, and single-shot qubit measurement. All three key processes\n(one-qubit gates, two-qubit gates, and qubit measurement) rely on the\ninteraction between the electron in each quantum dot and exciton-polaritons\nformed in a quantum well situated near the quantum dots. A key novel feature of\nour proposed system is the use of polariton traps, which we show enhances the\nquantum-dot--quantum-well interaction by a factor of 10 and consequently\nresults in $100 \\times$ faster two-qubit gates. We also introduce a novel\none-qubit gate that is based on a combination of optical and microwave control,\nwhich is supported in the same device and system configuration as the other\noperations, in contrast to the conventional one-qubit gate that is based on\nall-optical control.\n", "  The hexagonal superconductor SrPtAs exhibits time-reversal-symmetry breaking\nbelow $T_c$, hinting at an unconventional pairing state. Therefore, the\nsymmetry of the underlying crystal is important for the classification of\npossible gap structures and their mixing. Here, we use the generating point\ngroup D$_{6h}$ of SrPtAs for a comprehensive classification of the gap\nfunctions and to construct a tight-binding model. Our work clarifies questions\nof symmetry and topology in this non-symmorphic material and allows for better\ncomparison with other hexagonal systems.\n", "  In general relativity, the picture of spacetime assigns an ideal clock to\neach worldline. Being ideal, gravitational effects due to these clocks are\nignored and the flow of time according to one clock is not affected by the\npresence of clocks along nearby worldlines. However, if time is defined\noperationally, as a pointer position of a physical clock that obeys the\nprinciples of general relativity and quantum mechanics, such a picture is at\nmost a convenient fiction. Specifically, we show that the general relativistic\nmass-energy equivalence implies gravitational interaction between the clocks,\nwhile the quantum mechanical superposition of energy eigenstates leads to a\nnon-fixed metric background. Based only on the assumption that both principles\nhold in this situation, we show that the clocks necessarily get entangled\nthrough time dilation effect, which eventually leads to a loss of coherence of\na single clock. Hence, the time as measured by a single clock is not\nwell-defined. However, the general relativistic notion of time is recovered in\nthe classical limit of clocks.\n", "  MXenes are a set of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides\nthat offer many potential applications in energy storage and electronic\ndevices. As an important parameter to design new electronic devices, we\ninvestigate the work functions of bare MXenes and their functionalized ones\nwith F, OH, and O chemical groups using first-principles calculations. From our\ncalculations, it turns out that the OH terminated MXenes attain ultralow work\nfunctions between 1.6 and 2.8 eV. Moreover, depending on the type of the\ntransition metal, the F or O functionalization affects increasing or decreasing\nthe work functions. We show that the changes in the work functions upon\nfunctionalizations are linearly correlated with the changes in the surface\ndipole moments. It is shown that the work functions of the F or O terminated\nMXenes are controlled by two factors: the induced dipole moments by the charge\ntransfers between F/O and the substrate, and the changes in the total surface\ndipole moments caused by surface relaxation upon the functionalization.\nHowever, in the cases of the OH terminated MXenes, in addition to these two\nfactors, the intrinsic dipole moments of the OH groups play an important role\nin determining the total dipole moments and consequently justify their ultralow\nwork functions.\n", "  A class of dynamical dark energy models is constructed through an extended\nversion of fermion fields corresponding to phantom dark ghost spinors, which\nare spin one half with mass dimension one. We find that if these spinors\ninteract with torsion fields in a homogeneous and isotropic universe, then it\ndoes not imply any future dark energy singularity or any abrupt event, though\nthe fermion has a negative kinetic energy. In fact, the equation of state of\nthis dark energy model will asymptotically approach the value $w=-1$ from above\nwithout crossing the phantom divide and inducing therefore a de Sitter state.\nConsequently, we expect the model to be stable because no real phantom fields\nwill be created. At late time, the torsion fields will vanish as the\ncorresponding phantom dark ghost spinors dilute. As would be expected,\nintuitively, this result is unaffected by the presence of cold dark matter\nalthough the proof is not as straightforward as in general relativity.\n", "  We report on the morphological effects induced by the inhomogeneous\nabsorption of radially polarized femtosecond laser irradiation of nickel (Ni)\nin sub-ablation conditions. A theoretical prediction of the morphology profile\nis performed and the role of surface plasmon excitation in the production of\nself-formed periodic ripples structures is evaluated. Results indicate a\nsmaller periodicity of the ripples profile compared to that attained under\nlinearly polarized irradiation conditions. A combined hydrodynamical and\nthermoelastic model is presented in laser beam conditions that lead to material\nmelting. The simulation results are presented to be in good agreement with the\nexperimental findings. The ability to control the size of the morphological\nchanges via modulating the beam polarization may provide an additional route\nfor controlling and optimizing the outcome of laser micro-processing\n", "  Technology is a complex system, with technologies relating to each other in a\nspace that can be mapped as a network. The technology network's structure can\nreveal properties of technologies and of human behavior, if it can be mapped\naccurately. Technology networks have been made from patent data, using several\nmeasures of proximity. These measures, however, are influenced by factors of\nthe patenting system that do not reflect technologies or their proximity. We\nintroduce a method to precisely normalize out multiple impinging factors in\npatent data and extract the true signal of technological proximity, by\ncomparing the empirical proximity measures with what they would be in random\nsituations that remove the impinging factors. With this method, we created\ntechnology networks, using data from 3.9 million patents. After normalization,\ndifferent measures of proximity became more correlated with each other,\napproaching a single dimension of technological proximity. The normalized\ntechnology networks were sparse, with few pairs of technology domains being\nsignificantly related. The normalized network corresponded with human behavior:\nwe analyzed the patenting histories of 2.8 million inventors and found they\nwere more likely to invent in two different technology domains if the pair was\nclosely related in the technology network. We also analyzed 250 thousand firms'\npatents and found that, in contrast, firms' inventive activities were only\nmodestly associated with the technology network; firms' portfolios combined\npairs of technology domains about twice as often as inventors. These results\nsuggest that controlling for impinging factors provides meaningful measures of\ntechnological proximity for patent-based mapping of the technology space, and\nthat this map can be used to aid in technology innovation planning and\nmanagement.\n", "  In this work, we show that a giant spin current can be injected into a nodal\ntopological superconductor, using a normal paramagnetic lead, through a large\nnumber of zero energy Majorana fermions at the superconductor edge. The giant\nspin current is caused by the selective equal spin Andreev reflections (SESAR)\ninduced by Majorana fermions. In each SESAR event, a pair of electrons with\ncertain spin polarization are injected into the nodal topological\nsuperconductor, even though the pairing in the bulk of the nodal superconductor\nis spin-singlet s-wave. We further explain the origin of the spin current by\nshowing that the pairing correlation at the edge of a nodal topological\nsuperconductor is predominantly equal spin-triplet at zero energy. The\nexperimental consequences of SESAR in nodal topological superconductors are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We consider a flat Universe filled with a vacuum energy coupled to matter and\nradiation by respectively positive coupling functions $Q_m$ and $Q_r$. We\nrequire that these functions be such as Universe exits from inflation to go to\na radiation dominated epoch and allow to reproduce the observed $\\Lambda CDM$\nexpansion after this last epoch. These requirements lead to some necessary\nconstraints on the coupling functions. We then look at one of the simplest\nforms of $Q_m$ and $Q_r$ able to satisfy them. The cosmological model thus\ndefined describes a Universe with an initial singularity and endless alternated\nperiods of accelerated and decelerated expansion (one of them being our\n$\\Lambda CDM$ Universe) unifying inflation and present time expansion\nacceleration.\n", "  Probing vacuum structures deformed by high intense fields is of great\ninterest in general. In the context of quantum electrodynamics (QED), the\nvacuum exposed by a linearly polarized high-intensity laser field is expected\nto show birefringence. We consider the combination of a 10 PW laser system to\npump the vacuum and 1 GeV photons to probe the birefringent effect. The vacuum\nbirefringence can be measured via the polarization flip of the probe\n$\\gamma$-rays which can also be interpreted as phase retardation of probe\nphotons. We provide theoretically how to extract phase retardation of GeV probe\nphotons via pair-wise topology of the Bethe-Heitler process in a polarimeter\nand then evaluate the measurability of the vacuum birefringence via phase\nretardation given a concrete polarimeter design with a realistic set of laser\nparameters and achievable pulse statistics.\n", "  We investigate the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the in-gap bound states\nlocalized at magnetic impurities in multi-band superconductors with\nunconventional (sign-changed) and conventional (sign-unchanged) $s$-wave\npairing symmetry, which may be relevant to iron-based superconductors. Without\nspin-orbit coupling, for spin-singlet superconductors it is known that such\nbound states cross zero energy at a critical value of the impurity scattering\nstrength and acquire a finite spin-polarization. Moreover, the degenerate,\nspin-polarized, zero energy bound states are unstable to applied Zeeman fields\nas well as deviation of the impurity scattering strength away from criticality.\nUsing a T-matrix formalism as well as analytical arguments, we show that, in\nthe presence of spin-orbit coupling, the zero-energy bound states localized at\nmagnetic impurities in unconventional, sign-changed, $s$-wave superconductors\nacquire surprising robustness to applied Zeeman fields and variation in the\nimpurity scattering strength, an effect which is absent in the conventional,\nsign-unchanged, $s$-wave superconductors. Given that the iron-based multi-band\nsuperconductors may possess a substantial spin-orbit coupling as seen in recent\nexperiments, our results may provide one possible explanation to the recent\nobservation of surprisingly robust zero bias scanning tunneling microscope\npeaks localized at magnetic impurities in iron-based superconductors provided\nthe order parameter symmetry is sign changing $s_{+-}$-wave.\n", "  In this paper, we develop a numerical resolution of the space-time fractional\nadvection-dispersion equation. After time discretization, we utilize\ncollocation technique and implement a product integration method in order to\nsimplify the evaluation of the terms involving spatial fractional order\nderivatives. Then utilizing Bernstein polynomials as basis, the problem is\ntransformed into a linear system of algebraic equations. Error analysis and\norder of convergence for the proposed method are also discussed. Some numerical\nexperiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod and to confirm the analytic results.\n", "  We summarize some previous work on SU(4) describing hadron representations\nand transformations as well as its noncompact 'counterpart' SU$*$(4) being the\ncomplex embedding of SL(2,$\\mathbb{H}$). So after having related the 16-dim\nDirac algebra to SU$*$(4), on the one hand we have access to real, complex and\nquaternionic Lie group chains and their respective algebras, on the other hand\nit is of course possible to relate physical descriptions to the respective\nrepresentations. With emphasis on the common maximal compact subgroup USp(4),\nwe are led to projective geometry of real 3-space and various transfer\nprinciples which we use to extend previous work on the rank 3-algebras above.\nOn real spaces, such considerations are governed by the groups SO($n$,$m$) with\n$n+m=6$. The central thread, however, focuses here on line and Complex geometry\nwhich finds its well-known counterparts in descriptions of electromagnetism and\nspecial relativity as well as - using transfer principles - in Dirac, gauge and\nquantum field theory. We discuss a simple picture where Complexe of second\ngrade play the major and dominant r\\^{o}le to unify (real) projective geometry,\ncomplex representation theory and line/Complex representations in order to\nproceed to dynamics.\n", "  The quantization scheme based on reduction of the physical states\n\\cite{Park:2014tia} is extended to two gravity-matter systems and pure dS\ngravity. For the gravity-matter systems we focus on quantization in a flat\nbackground for simplicity, and renormalizability is established through\ngauge-fixing of matter degrees of freedom. Quantization of pure dS gravity has\nseveral new novel features. It is noted that the infrared divergence does not\narise in the present scheme of quantization. The lapse function constraint\nplays a crucial role.\n", "  A distance between von Neumann algebras is introduced, depending on a further\nnorm inducing the $w^*$-topology on bounded sets. Such notion is related both\nwith the Gromov-Hausdorff distance for quantum metric spaces of Rieffel and\nwith the Effros-Marechal topology on the von Neumann algebras acting on a\nHilbert space. This construction is tested on the local algebras of free\nquantum fields endowed with norms related with the Buchholz-Wichmann nuclearity\ncondition, showing the continuity of such algebras w.r.t. the mass parameter.\n", "  Gravitational lensing of invisible streaming matter towards the Sun could be\nthe explanation of the puzzling solar flares and the unexplained solar emission\nin the EUV. Assuming that this invisible matter has some form of interaction\nwith normal matter and that there exist preferred directions in its flow, then\none would expect a more pronounced solar activity at certain planetary\nheliocentric longitudes. This is best demonstrated in the case of the Earth and\nthe two inner planets. We have analyzed the solar flares as well as the EUV\nemission. We observe statistically significant signals when one or more planets\nhave heliocentric longitudes mainly between 230o and 300o. We also analyzed\ndaily data of the global ionization degree of the Earth atmosphere. We observe\na correlation between the total atmospheric electron content and the orbital\nposition of the inner three planets. Remarkably, the strongest correlation is\nappearing with the phase of the Moon.\n", "  We present a generalization of the theory of quantum symmetric pairs as\ndeveloped by Kolb and Letzter. We introduce a class of generalized Satake\ndiagrams that give rise to (not necessarily involutive) automorphisms of the\nsecond kind of symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras $\\mathfrak{g}$. These lead to\nright coideal subalgebras $B_{\\mathbf{c},\\mathbf{s}}$ of quantized enveloping\nalgebras $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$. In the case that $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a twisted or\nuntwisted affine Lie algebra of classical type Jimbo found intertwiners\n(equivariant maps) of the vector representation of $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$ yielding\ntrigonometric solutions to the parameter-dependent quantum Yang-Baxter\nequation. In the present paper we compute intertwiners of the vector\nrepresentation restricted to the subalgebras $B_{\\mathbf{c},\\mathbf{s}}$ when\n$\\mathfrak{g}$ is of type ${\\rm A}^{(1)}_n$, ${\\rm B}^{(1)}_n$, ${\\rm\nC}^{(1)}_n$ and ${\\rm D}^{(1)}_n$. These intertwiners are matrix solutions to\nthe parameter-dependent quantum reflection equation known as trigonometric\nreflection matrices. They are symmetric up to conjugation by a diagonal matrix\nand in many cases satisfy a certain sparseness condition: there are at most two\nnonzero entries in each row and column. Conjecturally, this classifies all such\nsolutions in vector spaces carrying this representation. A group of Hopf\nalgebra automorphisms of $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$ acts on these reflection matrices,\nallowing us to show that each reflection matrix found is equivalent to one with\nat most two additional free parameters. Additional characteristics of the\nreflection matrices such as eigendecompositions and affinization relations are\nalso obtained. The eigendecompositions suggest that for all these matrices\nthere should be a natural interpretation in terms of representations of\nHecke-type algebras.\n", "  We consider two-way continuous-variable quantum key distribution, studying\nits security against general eavesdropping strategies. Assuming the asymptotic\nlimit of many signals exchanged, we prove that two-way Gaussian protocols are\nimmune to coherent attacks. More precisely we show the general superadditivity\nof the two-way security thresholds, which are proven to be higher than the\ncorresponding one-way counterparts in all cases. We perform the security\nanalysis first reducing the general eavesdropping to a two-mode coherent\nGaussian attack, and then showing that the superadditivity is achieved by\nexploiting the random on/off switching of the two-way quantum communication.\nThis allows the parties to choose the appropriate communication instances to\nprepare the key, accordingly to the tomography of the quantum channel. The\nrandom opening and closing of the circuit represents, in fact, an additional\ndegree of freedom allowing the parties to convert, a posteriori, the two-mode\ncorrelations of the eavesdropping into noise. The eavesdropper is assumed to\nhave no access to the on/off switching and, indeed, cannot adapt her attack. We\nexplicitly prove that this mechanism enhances the security performance, no\nmatter if the eavesdropper performs collective or coherent attacks.\n", "  Ultra-cold atom-ion mixtures are gaining increasing interest due to their\npotential applications in quantum chemistry, quantum computing and many-body\nphysics. Here, we studied the dynamics of a single ground-state cooled ion\nduring few, to many, Langevin (spiraling) collisions with ultra-cold atoms. We\nmeasured the ion's energy distribution and observed a clear deviation from\nMaxwell-Boltzmann to a Tsallis characterized by a power-law tail of high\nenergies. Unlike previous experiments, the energy scale of atom-ion\ninteractions is not determined by either the atomic cloud temperature or the\nion's trap residual excess-micromotion energy. Instead, it is determined by the\nforce the atom exerts on the ion during a collision which is then amplified by\nthe trap dynamics. This effect is intrinsic to ion Paul traps and sets the\nlower bound of atom-ion steady-state interaction energy in these systems.\nDespite the fact that our system is eventually driven out of the ultra-cold\nregime, we are capable of studying quantum effects by limiting the interaction\nto the first collision.\n", "  Using the recent observation of gravitational waves (GW) produced by a\nblack-hole merger, we place a lower bound on the energy above which a\nmultifractal spacetime would display an anomalous geometry and, in particular,\nviolations of Lorentz invariance. In the so-called multifractional theory with\n$q$-derivatives, we show that the deformation of dispersion relations is much\nstronger than in generic quantum-gravity approaches (including loop quantum\ngravity) and, contrary to the latter, present observations on GWs can place\nvery strong bounds on the characteristic scales at which spacetime deviates\nfrom standard Minkowski. The energy at which multifractal effects should become\napparent is $E_*>10^{14}\\,{\\rm GeV}$ (thus improving previous bounds by 12\norders of magnitude) when the exponents in the measure are fixed to their\ncentral value $1/2$. We also estimate, for the first time, the effect of\nlogarithmic oscillations in the measure (corresponding to a discrete spacetime\nstructure) and find that they do not change much the bounds obtained in their\nabsence, unless the amplitude of the oscillations is fine tuned. This feature,\nunavailable in known quantum-gravity scenarios, may help the theory to avoid\nbeing ruled out by gamma-ray burst (GRB) observations, for which $E_*>\n10^{17}\\,{\\rm GeV}$ or greater.\n", "  As gaseous detectors are operated at high rates of primary ionisation, ions\ncreated in the detector have a considerable impact on the performance of the\ndetector. The upgraded ALICE Time Projection Chamber (TPC) will operate during\nLHC Run$\\,3$ with a substantial space charge density of positive ions in the\ndrift volume. In order to properly simulate such space charges, knowledge of\nthe ion mobility $K$ is necessary.\n  To this end, a small gaseous detector was constructed and the ion mobility of\nvarious gas mixtures was measured. To validate the corresponding signal\nanalysis, simulations were performed.\n  Results are shown for several argon and neon based mixtures with different\n$\\textrm{CO}_2$ fractions. A decrease of $K$ was measured for increasing water\ncontent.\n", "  Recently, the novel system of linear carbon chains inside of double-walled\ncarbon nanotubes has extended the length of $sp^1$ hybridized carbon chains\nfrom 44 to thousands of atoms [L. Shi et al., Nat. Mater. 15, 634 (2016)]. The\noptoelectronic properties of these ultra-long chains are poorly described by\ncurrent theoretical models, which are based on short chain experimental data\nand assume a constant environment. As such, a physical understanding of the\nsystem in terms of charge transfer and van der Waals interactions is widely\nmissing. We provide a reference for the intrinsic Raman frequency of polyynes\nin vacuo and explicitly describe the interactions between polyynes and carbon\nnanotubes. We find that van der Waals interactions strongly shift the Raman\nfrequency, which has been neither expected nor addressed before. As a\nconsequence of charge transfer from the tube to the chain, the Raman response\nof long chains is qualitatively different from the known phonon dispersion of\npolymers close to the $\\Gamma$-point. Based on these findings we show how to\ncorrectly interpret the Raman data, considering the nanotube's properties. This\nis essential for its use as an analytical tool to optimize the growth process\nfor future applications.\n", "  In the assessment of wood charring, it was believed for a long time that\nphysicochemical processes were responsible for the creation of cracking\npatterns on the charring wood surface. This implied no possibility to\nrigorously explain the crack topology. In this paper we show instead that below\nthe pyrolysis temperatures, a primary global macro-crack pattern is already\ncompletely established by means of a thermomechanical instability phenomenon.\nFirst we report experimental observations of the crack patterns on orthotropic\n(wood) and isotropic (Medium Density Fibreboard) materials in inert atmosphere.\nThen we solve the 3D thermomechanical buckling problem numerically by using the\nFinite Element Method, and show that the different crack topologies can be\nexplained qualitatively by the simultaneous thermal expansion and softening,\ntaking into account the directional dependence of the elastic properties.\nFinally, we formulate a 2D model for a soft layer bonded to an elastic\nsubstrate, and find an equation predicting the inter-crack distance in the main\ncrack-pattern for the orthotropic case. We also derive a formula for the\ncritical thermal stress above which the plane surface will wrinkle and buckle.\nThe results can be used for finding new ways to prevent or delay the crack\nformation, leading to improved fire safety of wood-based products.\n", "  The spatial evolution of the Rydberg blockade is studied taking into account\nStark-split energy levels across several manifolds. We find that the unexpected\nrestoration of a blockaded Rydberg excitation at small interatomic distances,\ne.g., experimentally observed by P.Schauss, et al. [Nature 491, 87 (2012)], can\nbe explained by the perturbed energy levels from neighboring manifolds that\nenter the energy window of excitation defined by the bandwidth of the exciting\nlaser. The same mechanism can also explain why the pair correlation function of\nRydberg atoms remains nonzero in the entire region of Rydberg blockade.\n", "  Photoemission and tunneling spectroscopies measure the energies at which\nsingle electrons can be added to or removed from an electronic system. Features\nobserved in such spectra have revealed electrons coupling to vibrational modes\nof ions both in solids and in individual molecules. Here we report the\ndiscovery of a sharp resonance in the tunneling spectrum of a 2D electron\nsystem. Its behavior suggests that it originates from vibrational modes, not\ninvolving ionic motion, but instead arising from vibrations of spatial ordering\nof the electrons themselves. In a two-dimensional electronic system at very low\ntemperatures and high magnetic fields, electrons can either condense into a\nvariety of quantum Hall phases or arrange themselves into a highly ordered\nWigner crystal lattice. Such spatially ordered phases of electrons are often\nelectrically insulating and delicate and have proven very challenging to probe\nwith conventional methods. Using a unique pulsed tunneling method capable of\nprobing electron tunneling into insulating phases, we observe a sharp peak with\ndependencies on energy and other parameters that fit to models for vibrations\nof a Wigner crystal. The remarkable sharpness of the structure presents strong\nevidence of the existence of a Wigner crystal with long correlation length.\n", "  Odd-frequency superconductivity, originally proposed by Berezinskii in 1974,\nis an exotic phase of matter in which Cooper pairing between electrons is\nentirely dynamical in nature. The pair potential is an odd function of\nfrequency, leading to a vanishing static superconducting order parameter and\nexotic types of pairing seemingly inconsistent with Fermi statistics. Motivated\nby recent experimental progress in the realization of Majorana zero modes in\nsemiconducting nanowires, we show that odd-frequency superconductivity\ngenerically appears in a spin-polarized nanowire coupled to Majorana zero\nmodes. We explicitly calculate the superfluid response and show that it is\ncharacterized by a paramagnetic Meissner effect.\n", "  Controlled syntheses in nanoscale structures should be expected and\nphosphorous nanotubes with predefined chiralities are important in electronic\ndevices with tunable bandgap. Here, incorporating molecular dynamics\nsimulations with theoretical analyses, we show that a zigzag phosphorene\nnanoribbon can self-assemble and form a corresponding chiral phosphorous\nnanotube surrounding a template armchair phosphorous nanotube. The van der\nWaals potential between the nanoribbon and the nanotube is transformed to the\nintrinsic deformed and chemical bonding energies of the synthesized tube\ntogether with partial kinetic energy. The self-assembly process has an apparent\ntemperature dependence and size effect and the formed chiral tube is\nthermodynamically stable. Also, the chirality and measurement can be tuned by\nthe radius of template tube and the aspect ratio of raw ribbon. The study\nsuggests a novel and feasible approach for controlled synthesis of phosphorous\nnanotubes and thus is of great interest for semiconductor device applications.\n", "  The observation of objects located in inaccessible regions is a recurring\nchallenge in a wide variety of important applications. Recent work has shown\nthat indirect diffuse light reflections can be used to reconstruct objects and\ntwo-dimensional (2D) patterns around a corner. However, these prior methods\nalways require some specialized setup involving either ultrafast detectors or\nnarrowband light sources. Here we show that occluded objects can be tracked in\nreal time using a standard 2D camera and a laser pointer. Unlike previous\nmethods based on the backprojection approach, we formulate the problem in an\nanalysis-by-synthesis sense. By repeatedly simulating light transport through\nthe scene, we determine the set of object parameters that most closely fits the\nmeasured intensity distribution. We experimentally demonstrate that this\napproach is capable of following the translation of unknown objects, and\ntranslation and orientation of a known object, in real time.\n", "  Determining the masses of new physics particles appearing in decay chains is\nan important and longstanding problem in high energy phenomenology. Recently it\nhas been shown that these mass measurements can be improved by utilizing the\nboundary of the allowed region in the fully differentiable phase space in its\nfull dimensionality. Here we show that the practical challenge of identifying\nthis boundary can be solved using techniques based on the geometric properties\nof the cells resulting from Voronoi tessellations of the relevant data. The\nrobust detection of such phase space boundaries in the data could also be used\nto corroborate a new physics discovery based on a cut-and-count analysis.\n", "  The QCD axion is an hypothetical particle introduced to solve the strong CP\nproblem of standard model of particle physics and is of interest as a possible\ncomponent of cold dark matter. In the axion scenario, J.E. Moody and F. Wilczek\nshowed that a new macroscopic long-range force, mediated by axion exchange,\nacts on electron spins, and that such force can be described in terms of an\neffective magnetic field. The QUAX-g$_p$g$_s$ experiment, carried out at INFN\nLaboratori Nazionali di Legnaro, is designed to search for the effects on\nmagnetized samples of the effective field produced by unpolarized mass sources.\nAs this field is macroscopic, it can be detected by measuring the change of\nmagnetization of a paramagnetic Gadolinium silicate (GSO) crystal cooled at\nliquid helium temperature. The axion effective field induced magnetization can\nbe detected with a SQUID magnetometer. By varying the position of the of source\nmasses, the induced GSO magnetization is modulated at acoustic frequencies.\nAlthough the full QUAX-g$_p$g$_s$ sensitivity has not been yet exploited, we\nare able to measure a magnetization of $10^{-17}~$T at few tens of Hz. With\nthis sensitivity we expect to further improve the upper limit of the coupling\nof the predicted long-range force in the $10^{-3}$ to $1~$m interval.\n", "  We apply deep recurrent neural networks, which are capable of learning\ncomplex sequential information, to classify supernovae\\footnote{Code available\nat\n\\href{https://github.com/adammoss/supernovae}{https://github.com/adammoss/supernovae}}.\nThe observational time and filter fluxes are used as inputs to the network, but\nsince the inputs are agnostic additional data such as host galaxy information\ncan also be included. Using the Supernovae Photometric Classification Challenge\n(SPCC) data, we find that deep networks are capable of learning about light\ncurves, however the performance of the network is highly sensitive to the\namount of training data. For a training size of 50\\% of the representational\nSPCC dataset (around $10^4$ supernovae) we obtain a type-Ia vs. non-type-Ia\nclassification accuracy of 94.7\\%, an area under the Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic curve AUC of 0.986 and a SPCC figure-of-merit $F_1=0.64$. When\nusing only the data for the early-epoch challenge defined by the SPCC we\nachieve a classification accuracy of 93.1\\%, AUC of 0.977 and $F_1=0.58$,\nresults almost as good as with the whole light-curve. By employing\nbidirectional neural networks we can acquire impressive classification results\nbetween supernovae types -I,~-II and~-III at an accuracy of 90.4\\% and AUC of\n0.974. We also apply a pre-trained model to obtain classification probabilities\nas a function of time, and show it can give early indications of supernovae\ntype. Our method is competitive with existing algorithms and has applications\nfor future large-scale photometric surveys.\n", "  Recently, aLIGO has announced the first direct detections of gravitational\nwaves, a direct manifestation of the propagating degrees of freedom of gravity.\nThe detected signals GW150914 and GW151226 have been used to examine the basic\nproperties of these gravitational degrees of freedom, particularly setting an\nupper bound on their mass. It is timely to review what the mass of these\ngravitational degrees of freedom means from the theoretical point of view,\nparticularly taking into account the recent developments in constructing\nconsistent massive gravity theories. Apart from the GW150914 mass bound, a few\nother observational bounds have been established from the effects of the Yukawa\npotential, modified dispersion relation and fifth force that are all induced\nwhen the fundamental gravitational degrees of freedom are massive. We review\nthese different mass bounds and examine how they stand in the wake of recent\ntheoretical developments and how they compare to the bound from GW150914.\n", "  We analyze the coupled quintessence in the light of the linear dynamical\nsystems theory, with two different interactions: i) proportional to the energy\ndensity of the dark energy and ii) proportional to the sum of the energy\ndensities of the dark matter and dark energy. The results presented here\nenlarge the previous analyses in the literature, wherein the interaction has\nbeen only proportional to the energy density of the dark matter. In the first\ncase it is possible to get the well-known sequence of cosmological eras. For\nthe second interaction only the radiation and the dark energy era can be\ndescribed by the fixed points. Therefore, from the point-of-view of the\ndynamical system theory, the interaction proportional to the sum of the energy\ndensities of the dark matter and dark energy does not describe the universe we\nlive in.\n", "  We calculate for the first time the phonon excitation rate in the outer crust\nof a neutron star due to scattering from light dark matter (LDM) particles\ngravitationally boosted into the star. We consider dark matter particles in the\nsub-GeV mass range scattering off a periodic array of nuclei through an\neffective scalar-vector interaction with nucleons. We find that LDM effects\ncause a modification of the net number of phonons in the lattice as compared to\nthe standard thermal result. In addition, we estimate the contribution of LDM\nto the ion-ion thermal conductivity in the outer crust and find that it can be\nsignificantly enhanced at large densities. Our results imply that for\nmagnetized neutron stars the LDM-enhanced global conductivity in the outer\ncrust will tend to reduce the anisotropic heat conduction between perpendicular\nand parallel directions to the magnetic field.\n", "  We propose a measure of macroscopic coherence based on the degree of\ndisturbance caused by a coarse-grained measurement. Based on our measure, we\npoint out that recently proposed criteria of macroscopic coherence may lead to\ninconsistent results when considering certain states such as a product of\nmicroscopic superpositions. An inequality relation is proved that relates the\nWigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information and the measurement disturbance, providing\narguments as to why our approach is able to rule out such inconsistencies. We\nshow that our measure can also quantify the fragility of a quantum state to a\ncertain type of decoherence. Our work provides a general framework of\nquantifying macroscopic coherence from an operational point of view, based on\nthe relationship between the precision of the measurement and disturbance of\nthe quantum state.\n", "  Harnessing artificial optical magnetism requires rather complex two- and\nthree-dimensional structures, examples include split-ring and fishnet\nmetamaterials and nanoparticles with non-trivial magnetic properties. By\ncontrast, dielectric properties can be tailored even in planar and\npattern-free, one-dimensional (1D) arrangements, for example metal/dielectric\nmultilayer metamaterials. These systems are extensively investigated due to\ntheir hyperbolic and plasmonic response, which, however, is considered to be\nlimited to TM polarization, based on the general consensus that they do not\npossess interesting magnetic properties. In this work, we tackle these two\nseemingly unrelated issues simultaneously, by proposing conceptually and\ndemonstrating experimentally a mechanism for artificial magnetism in planar, 1D\nmetamaterials. We show experimentally that the magnetic response of\nmetal/high-index dielectric hyperbolic metamaterials can be anisotropic,\nleading to frequency regimes of magnetic hyperbolic dispersion. We investigate\nthe implications of our results for TE polarization and show that such systems\ncan support TE interface-bound states, analogous to their TM counterparts,\nsurface plasmon polaritons. Our results simplify the structural complexity for\ntailoring artificial magnetism in lithography-free systems and generalize the\nconcept of plasmonic and hyperbolic properties to encompass both TE and TM\npolarizations at optical frequencies.\n", "  We examine theoretically the spreading of a viscous liquid drop over a thin\nfilm of uniform thickness, assuming the liquid's viscosity is regulated by the\nconcentration of a solute that is carried passively by the spreading flow. The\nsolute is assumed to be initially heterogeneous, having a spatial distribution\nwith prescribed statistical features. To examine how this variability\ninfluences the drop's motion, we investigate spreading in a planar geometry\nusing lubrication theory, combining numerical simulations with asymptotic\nanalysis. We assume diffusion is sufficient to suppress solute concentration\ngradients across but not along the film. The solute field beneath the bulk of\nthe drop is stretched by the spreading flow, such that the initial solute\nconcentration immediately behind the drop's effective contact lines has a\nlong-lived influence on the spreading rate. Over long periods, solute swept up\nfrom the precursor film accumulates in a short region behind the contact line,\nallowing patches of elevated viscosity within the precursor film to hinder\nspreading. A low-order model provides explicit predictions of the variances in\nspreading rate and drop location, which are validated against simulations.\n", "  We generalize the hierarchical equations of motion method to study electron\ntransport through a quantum dot or molecule coupled to one-dimensional\ninteracting leads that can be described as Luttinger liquids. Such leads can be\nrealized, for example, by quantum wires or fractional quantum Hall edge states.\nIn comparison to noninteracting metallic leads, Luttinger liquid leads involve\nmany-body correlations and the single-particle tunneling density of states\nshows a power-law singularity at the chemical potential. Using the generalized\nhierarchical equations of motion method, we assess the importance of the\nsingularity and the next-to-leading order many-body correlations. To this end,\nwe compare numerically converged results with second and first-order results of\nthe hybridization expansion that is inherent to our method. As a test case, we\nstudy transport through a single-level quantum dot or molecule that can be\ndescribed by an Anderson impurity model. Cotunneling effects turn out to be\nmost pronounced for attractive interactions in the leads or repulsive ones if\nan excitonic coupling between the dot and the leads is realized. We also find\nthat an interaction-induced negative differential conductance near the Coulomb\nblockade thresholds is slightly suppressed as compared to a first-order and/or\nrate equation result. Moreover, we find that the two-particle ($n$-particle)\ncorrelations enter as a second-order ($n$-order) effect and are, thus, not very\npronounced at the high temperatures and parameters that we consider.\n", "  We consider circular motion in the NUT (Newman-Unti-Tamburino) space-time.\nAmong other things, we determine the location of circular time-like geodesic\norbits, in particular of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and of the\nmarginally bound circular orbit. Moreover, we discuss the von Zeipel cylinders\nwith respect to the stationary observers and with respect to the Zero Angular\nMomentum Observers (ZAMOs). We also investigate the relation of von Zeipel\ncylinders to inertial forces, in particular in the ultra-relativistic limit.\nFinally, we generalise the construction of thick accretion tori (\"Polish\ndoughnuts\") which are well known on the Schwarzschild or Kerr background to the\ncase of the NUT metric. We argue that, in principle, a NUT source could be\ndistinguished from a Schwarzschild or Kerr source by observing the features of\ncircular matter flows in its neighbourhood.\n", "  We consider the secret key capacity of the thermal loss channel, which is\nmodeled by a beam splitter mixing an input signal mode with an environmental\nthermal mode. This capacity is the maximum value of secret bits that two remote\nparties can generate by means of the most general adaptive protocols assisted\nby unlimited and two-way classical communication. To date, only upper and lower\nbounds are known. The present work improves the lower bound by resorting to\nGaussian protocols based on suitable trusted-noise detectors.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of a quantized vortex and a nuclear impurity\nimmersed in a neutron superfluid within a fully microscopic time-dependent\nthree-dimensional approach. The magnitude and even the sign of the force\nbetween the quantized vortex and the nuclear impurity have been a matter of\ndebate for over four decades. We determine that the vortex and the impurity\nrepel at neutron densities, 0.014 fm$^{-3}$ and 0.031 fm$^{-3}$, which are\nrelevant to the neutron star crust and the origin of glitches, while previous\ncalculations have concluded that the force changes its sign between these two\ndensities and predicted contradictory signs. The magnitude of the force\nincreases with the density of neutron superfluid, while the magnitude of the\npairing gap decreases in this density range.\n", "  A measurement of the $t$-channel single-top-quark and single-top-antiquark\nproduction cross-sections in the lepton+je ts channel is presented, using 3.2\nfb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\nTeV, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015. Events are selected\nby requiring one charged lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse\nmomentum, and two jets with high transverse momentum, exactly one of which is\nrequired to be $b$-tagged. Using a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the\ndiscriminant distribution of a neural network, the cross-sections are\ndetermined to be $\\sigma(tq) = 156 \\pm 5 \\, (\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm 27 \\,\n(\\mathrm{syst.}) \\pm 3\\,(\\mathrm{lumi.})$ pb for single top-quark production\nand $\\sigma(\\bar{t}q) = 91 \\pm 4 \\, (\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm 18 \\, (\\mathrm{syst.})\n\\pm 2\\,(\\mathrm{lumi.})$ pb for single top-antiquark production, assuming a\ntop-quark mass of 172.5 GeV. The cross-section ratio is measured to be $R_t =\n\\sigma(tq)/\\sigma(\\bar{t}q) = 1.72 \\pm 0.09 \\, (\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm 0.18 \\,\n(\\mathrm{syst.})$.\n", "  The properties of $(d-1)$-dimensional $s$-wave holographic superconductor in\nthe presence of power-Maxwell field is explored. We study the probe limit in\nwhich the scalar and gauge fields do not backreact on the background geometry.\nOur study is based on the matching of solutions on the boundary and on the\nhorizon at some intermediate point. At first, the case without external\nmagnetic field is considered, and the critical temperature is obtained in terms\nof the charge density, the dimensionality, and the power-Maxwell exponent.\nThen, a magnetic field is turned on in the $d$-dimensional bulk which can\ninfluence the $(d-1)$-dimensional holographic superconductor at the boundary.\nThe phase behavior of the corresponding holographic superconductor is obtained\nby computing the upper critical magnetic field in the presence of power-Maxwell\nelectrodynamics, characterized by the power exponent $q$. Interestingly, it is\nobserved that in the presence of magnetic field, the physically acceptable\nphase behavior of the holographic superconductor is obtained for $q={d}/{4}$,\nwhich guaranties the conformal invariance of the power-Maxwell Lagrangian. The\ncase of physical interest in five spacetime dimensions ($d=5$, and $q=5/4$) is\nconsidered in detail, and compared with the results obtained for the usual\nMaxwell electrodynamics $q=1$ in the same dimensions.\n", "  We review the properties of Majorana fermions in particle physics and point\nout that Majorana modes in solid state systems are significantly different. The\nkey reason is the concept of anti-particle in solid state systems is different\nfrom its counterpart in particle physics. We define Majorana modes as the\neigenstates of Majorana operators and find that they can exist both at edges\nand in the bulk. According to our definition, only one single Majorana mode can\nexist in a system no matter at edges or in the bulk. Kitaev's spinless $p$-wave\nsuperconductor is used to illustrate our results and the dynamical behavior of\nthe Majorana modes.\n", "  Optoelectronic devices based on graphene and other two-dimensional (2D)\nmaterials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are the focus of\nwide research interest. The characterization these emerging atomically thin\nmaterials and devices strongly relies on a set of measurements involving both\noptical and electronic instrumentation ranging from scanning photocurrent\nmapping to Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Furthermore,\nproof-of-concept devices are usually fabricated from micro-meter size flakes,\nrequiring microscopy techniques to characterize them. Current state-of-the-art\ncommercial instruments offer the ability to characterize individual properties\nof these materials with no option for the in situ characterization of a wide\nenough range of complementary optical and electrical properties. Presently, the\nrequirement to switch atomically-thin materials from one system to another\noften radically affects the properties of these uniquely sensitive materials\nthrough atmospheric contamination. Here, we present an integrated,\nmulti-purpose instrument dedicated to the optical and electrical\ncharacterization of devices based on 2D materials which is able to perform low\nfrequency electrical measurements, scanning photocurrent mapping, Raman,\nabsorption and PL spectroscopy in one single set-up. We characterize this\napparatus by performing multiple measurements on graphene, transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) and Si. The performance and resolution of each\nindividual measurement technique is found to be equivalent to that of\ncommercially available instruments. Contrary to nowadays commercial systems, a\nsignificant advantage of the developed instrument is that for the first time\nthe integration of a wide range of complementary opto-electronic and\nspectroscopy characterization techniques is demonstrated in a single compact\nunit.\n", "  Electron beam probe (EBP) is a new principle detector, which makes use of a\nlow-intensity and low-energy electron beam to measure the transverse profile,\nbunch shape, beam neutralization and beam wake field of an intense beam with\nsmall dimensions. While can be applied to many aspects, we limit our analysis\nto beam distribution reconstruction. This kind of detector is almost\nnon-interceptive for all of the beam and does not disturb the machine\nenvironment. In this paper, we present the theoretical aspects behind this\ntechnique for beam distribution measurement and some simulation results of the\ndetector involved. First, a method to obtain parallel electron beam is\nintroduced and a simulation code is developed. And then, EBP as a profile\nmonitor for dense beam is simulated using fast scan method under various target\nbeam profile, such as KV distribution, waterbag distribution, parabolic\ndistribution, Gaussian distribution and halo distribution. Profile\nreconstruction from the deflected electron beam trajectory is implemented and\ncompared with the actual one, and an expected agreement is achieved.\nFurthermore, Instead of fast scan, a slow scan, i.e. step-by-step scan, is\nconsidered, which lows the requirement for hardware, i.e. Radio Frequency\ndeflector. we calculate the three dimensional electric field of Gaussian\ndistribution and simulate the electron motion under this field. In addition,\nfast scan along the target beam direction and slow scan across the beam is also\npresented, and can provide a measurement of longitudinal distribution as well\nas transverse profile simultaneously. Final, simulation results for China\nAccelerator Driven Sub-critical System (CADS) and High Intensity Heavy Ion\nAccelerator Facility (HIAF) are given to investigate the quantitative behavior\nof EBP.\n", "  Periodic Anderson model (PAM), where local electron orbitals interplay with\nitinerant electronic carriers, plays an essential role in our understanding on\nheavy fermion materials. Motivated by recent proposal of simulating Kondo\nlattice model (KLM) in terms of alkaline-earth metal atoms, we make a further\nstep toward simulation of PAM, which includes crucial charge/valence\nfluctuation of local f-electron beyond purely low-energy spin fluctuation in\nKLM. To realize PAM, transition induced by suitable laser between electronic\nexcited and ground state of alkaline-earth metal atoms\n($^{1}S_{0}$$\\rightleftharpoons$$^{3}P_{0}$) is introduced, and it leads to\neffective hybridization between local electron and conduction electron in PAM.\nGenerally, the $SU(N)$ version of PAM can be realized by our proposal, which\ngives a unique opportunity to detect large-$N$ physics without complexity in\nrealistic materials. In the present work, high temperature physical feature of\nstandard ($SU(2)$) PAM with harmonic trapping potential is detailed analyzed by\nquantum Monte Carlo and dynamic mean-field theory. Indications for near-future\nexperiments are provided. We expect our theoretical proposal and (hopefully)\nforthcoming experiment will deepen our understanding on heavy fermion systems\nand at the same time triggers further studies on related Mott physics, quantum\ncriticality and non-trivial topology in both inhomogeneous and nonequilibrium\nrealm.\n", "  Is it possible to reverse the low total fertility rate (TFR) in the developed\nworld? Using a hypothetical model of population we have analysed the decline of\nthe TFR which have took place in the background of ongoing global economic\nchanges, and a liberalization process after the end of the Cold War. These\nphenomena have affected more than 110 millions of inhabitants of Central Europe\nand the Baltics and approximately 80 millions of inhabitants in Germany. The\nmodel has features of complex and evolving system of interacting individuals,\nand it enables to investigate a broad spectrum of input factors on individual\ndecisions to limit the offspring. In the case of the TFR <1.5, our initial\nanalysis show a need of radical changes of the global economy that will\nstimulate series of self-regulations of demographic processes and evolution\ntoward the safe TFR>2.1. The changes should stimulate more uniform spatial\ndistribution of wealth, capital and usage. They will increase a number of\nself-sufficient and cooperative territories, to decrease the income inequality,\nto decrease labour and social mobilities. Societies should investigate the\nimpacts of economic regulations and actions on the TFR trends in advance and\ntake into account a biological nature of women more responsible.\n", "  Using conservation of energy - a fundamental property of closed classical and\nquantum mechanical systems - we develop an efficient gradient-domain machine\nlearning (GDML) approach to construct accurate molecular force fields using a\nrestricted number of samples from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)\ntrajectories. The GDML implementation is able to reproduce global potential\nenergy surfaces of intermediate-sized molecules with an accuracy of 0.3 kcal\n$\\text{mol}^{-1}$ for energies and 1 kcal $\\text{mol}^{-1}$ $\\text{\\AA}^{-1}$\nfor atomic forces using only 1000 conformational geometries for training. We\ndemonstrate this accuracy for AIMD trajectories of molecules, including\nbenzene, toluene, naphthalene, ethanol, uracil, and aspirin. The challenge of\nconstructing conservative force fields is accomplished in our work by learning\nin a Hilbert space of vector-valued functions that obey the law of energy\nconservation. The GDML approach enables quantitative molecular dynamics\nsimulations for molecules at a fraction of cost of explicit AIMD calculations,\nthereby allowing the construction of efficient force fields with the accuracy\nand transferability of high-level ab initio methods.\n", "  Determining the equilibrium configuration and shape of curved two-dimensional\nfilms with (generalized) liquid crystalline (LC) order is a difficult infinite\ndimensional problem of direct relevance to the study of generalized\npolymersomes, soft matter and the fascinating problem of understanding the\norigin and formation of shape (morphogenesis). The symmetry of the free energy\nof the LC film being considered and the topology of the surface to be\ndetermined often requires that the equilibrium configuration possesses singular\nstructures in the form of topological defects such as disclinations for nematic\nfilms. The precise number and type of defect plays a fundamental role in\nrestricting the space of possible equilibrium shapes. Flexible closed vesicles\nwith spherical topology and nematic or smectic order, for example, inevitably\npossess four elementary strength $+1/2$ disclination defects positioned at the\nfour vertices of a tetrahedral shell. Here we address the problem of\ndetermining the equilibrium shape of flexible vesicles with generalized LC\norder. The order parameter in these cases is an element of $S^1/Z_p$, for any\npositive integer $p$. We will focus on the case $p =3$, known as triatic LCs.\nWe construct the appropriate order parameter for triatics and find the\nassociated free energy. We then describe the structure of the elementary\ndefects of strength $+1/3$ in flat space. Finally, we prove that sufficiently\nfloppy triatic vesicles with the topology of the 2-sphere equilibrate to\noctahedral shells with strength $+1/3$ defects at each of the six vertices,\nindependently of scale.\n", "  An in-situ nanoscopic investigation of the prototypical surface alloying\nsystem Ag/Pt(111) is reported. The morphology and the structure of the\nultrathin Ag-Pt film is studied using Low Energy Electron Microscopy during\ngrowth at about 800 K. An amazingly rich dynamic behaviour is uncovered in\nwhich stress relieve plays a governing role. Initial growth leads to surface\nalloying with prolonged and retarded nucleation of ad-islands. Beyond 50%\ncoverage de-alloying proceeds, joined by partial segregation of Pt towards the\ncentre of large islands in violent processes. Upon coalescence the irregularly\nshaped vacancy clusters are filled by segregating Pt, which then take a compact\nshape (black spots). As a result at around 85% coverage the strain of the\ninitially pseudo-morphological film is almost completely relieved and\nPt-segregation is at its maximum. Further deposition of Ag leads to transient\nre-entrant alloying and recovery of the pseudo-morphological layer. The black\nspots persist even in/on several layers thick films. Ex-situ atomic force\nmicroscopy data confirm that these are constituted by probably amorphous\nPt(-rich) structures. The (sub-)monolayer films are very much heterogeneous.\n", "  The canonical approach, which was developed for solving the sign problem, may\nsuffer from a new type of sign problem. In the canonical approach, the grand\npartition function is written as a fugacity expansion: $Z_G(\\mu,T) = \\sum_n\nZ_C(n,T) \\xi^n$, where $\\xi=\\exp(\\mu/T)$ is the fugacity, and $Z_C(n,T)$ are\ngiven as averages over a Monte Carlo update, $\\langle z_n\\rangle$. We show that\nthe complex phase of $z_n$ is proportional to $n$ at each Monte Carlo step.\nAlthough $\\langle z_n\\rangle$ take real positive values, the values of $z_n$\nfluctuate rapidly when $n$ is large, especially in the confinement phase, which\ngives a limit on $n$. We discuss possible remedies for this problem.\n", "  We develop methods to deal with non-dynamical contributions to event-by-event\nfluctuation measurements of net-particle numbers in relativistic nuclear\ncollisions. These contributions arise from impact parameter fluctuations and\nfrom the requirement of overall net-baryon number or net-charge conservation\nand may mask the dynamical fluctuations of interest, such as those due to\ncritical endpoints in the QCD phase diagram. Within a model of independent\nparticle sources we derive formulae for net-particle fluctuations and develop a\nrigorous approach to take into account contributions from participant\nfluctuations in realistic experimental environments and at any cumulant order.\nInterestingly, contributions from participant fluctuations to the second and\nthird cumulants of net-baryon distributions are found to vanish at mid-rapidity\nfor LHC energies while higher cumulants of even order are non-zero even when\nthe net-baryon number at mid-rapidity is zero. At lower beam energies the\neffect of participant fluctuations increases and induces spurious higher\nmoments. The necessary corrections become large and need to be carefully taken\ninto account before comparison to theory. We also provide a procedure for\nselecting the optimal phase-space coverage of particles for fluctuation\nanalyses and discuss quantitatively the necessary correction due to global\ncharge conservation.\n", "  The energetics of vicinal SrTiO$_3$(001) and DyScO$_3$(110), prototypical\nperovskite vicinal surfaces, has been studied using topographic atomic force\nmicroscopy imaging. The kink formation and strain relaxation energies are\nextracted from a statistical analysis of the step meandering. Both perovskite\nsurfaces have very similar kink formation energies and exhibit a similar\ntriangular step undulation. Our experiments suggest that the energetics of\nperovskite oxide surfaces is mainly governed by the local oxygen coordination.\n", "  The symmetry of single-molecule magnets dictates their spin quantum dynamics,\ninfluencing how such systems relax via quantum tunneling of magnetization\n(QTM). By reducing a system's symmetry, through the application of a magnetic\nfield or uniaxial pressure, these dynamics can be modified. We report\nmeasurements of the magnetization dynamics of a crystalline sample of the\nhigh-symmetry [Mn12O12(O2CMe)16(MeOH)4]MeOH single-molecule magnet as a\nfunction of uniaxial pressure applied either parallel or perpendicular to the\nsample's \"easy\" magnetization axis. At temperatures between 1.8 and 3.3 K,\nmagnetic hysteresis loops exhibit the characteristic steplike features that\nsignal the occurrence of QTM. After applying uniaxial pressure to the sample in\nsitu, both the magnitude and field position of the QTM steps changed. The step\nmagnitudes were observed to grow as a function of pressure in both arrangements\nof pressure, while pressure applied along (perpendicular to) the sample's easy\naxis caused the resonant-tunneling fields to increase (decrease). These\nobservations were compared with simulations in which the system's Hamiltonian\nparameters were changed. From these comparisons, we determined that parallel\npressure induces changes to the second-order axial anisotropy parameter as well\nas either the fourth-order axial or fourth-order transverse parameter, or to\nboth. In addition, we find that pressure applied perpendicular to the easy axis\ninduces a rhombic anisotropy E ~ D/2000 per kbar that can be understood as\nderiving from a symmetry-breaking distortion of the molecule.\n", "  The XENON1T experiment aims for the direct detection of dark matter in a\ncryostat filled with 3.3 tons of liquid xenon. In order to achieve the desired\nsensitivity, the background induced by radioactive decays inside the detector\nhas to be sufficiently low. One major contributor is the $\\beta$-emitter\n$^{85}$Kr which is an intrinsic contamination of the xenon. For the XENON1T\nexperiment a concentration of natural krypton in xenon $\\rm{^{nat}}$Kr/Xe < 200\nppq (parts per quadrillion, 1 ppq = 10$^{-15}$ mol/mol) is required. In this\nwork, the design of a novel cryogenic distillation column using the common\nMcCabe-Thiele approach is described. The system demonstrated a krypton\nreduction factor of 6.4$\\cdot$10$^5$ with thermodynamic stability at process\nspeeds above 3 kg/h. The resulting concentration of $\\rm{^{nat}}$Kr/Xe < 26 ppq\nis the lowest ever achieved, almost one order of magnitude below the\nrequirements for XENON1T and even sufficient for future dark matter experiments\nusing liquid xenon, such as XENONnT and DARWIN.\n", "  Recent SPH simulations by Martin et al. (2014) suggest a circumstellar\ngaseous disk may exhibit coherent eccentricity-inclination oscillations due to\nthe tidal forcing of an inclined binary companion, in a manner that resembles\nLidov-Kozai oscillations in hierarchical triple systems. We carry out linear\nstability analysis for the eccentricity growth of circumstellar disks in\nbinaries, including the effects of gas pressure and viscosity and secular\n(orbital-averaged) tidal force from the inclined companion. We find that the\ngrowth of disk eccentricity depends on the dimensionless ratio ($S$) between\n$c_{\\rm s}^2$ (the disk sound speed squared) and the tidal torque acting on the\ndisk (per unit mass) from the companion. For $S\\ll 1$, the standard Lidov-Kozai\nresult is recovered for a thin disk annulus: eccentricity excitation occurs\nwhen the mutual inclination $I$ between the disk and binary lies between\n$39^\\circ$ and $141^\\circ$. As $S$ increases, the inclination window for\neccentricity growth generally becomes narrower. For $S\\gtrsim$ a few,\neccentricity growth is suppressed for all inclination angles. Surprisingly, we\nfind that for $S\\sim 1$ and certain disk density/pressure profiles,\neccentricity excitation can occur even when $I$ is much less than $39^\\circ$.\n", "  Eddy-current problems occur in a wide range of industrial and metallurgical\napplications where conducting material is processed inductively. Motivated by\nrealising coupled multi-physics simulations, we present a new method for the\nsolution of such problems in the finite volume framework of foam-extend, an\nextended version of the very popular OpenFOAM software. The numerical procedure\ninvolves a semi-coupled multi-mesh approach to solve Maxwell's equations for\nnon-magnetic materials by means of the Coulomb gauged magnetic vector potential\nand the electric scalar potential. The concept is further extended on the basis\nof the impressed and reduced magnetic vector potential and its usage in\naccordance with Biot-Savart's law to achieve a very efficient overall modelling\neven for complex three-dimensional geometries. Moreover, we present a special\ndiscretisation scheme to account for possible discontinuities in the electrical\nconductivity. To complement our numerical method, an extensive validation is\ncompleting the paper, which provides insight into the behaviour and the\npotential of our approach.\n", "  In this paper we construct several new families of quantum codes with good\nand asymptotically good parameters. These new quantum codes are derived from\n(classical) algebraic geometry (AG) codes by applying the\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction. Many of these codes have large\nminimum distances when compared with its code length and they have relatively\nsmall Singleton defect. For example, we construct a family [[46; 2(t_2 - t1);\nd]]_25 of quantum codes, where t_1, t_2 are positive integers such that 1 < t_1\n< t_2 < 23 and d >= min {46 - 2t_2, 2t_1-2}, of length n = 46, with minimum\ndistance in the range 2 =< d =< 20, having Singleton defect four. Additionally,\nby utilizing t-point AG codes, with t >= 2, we show how to obtain sequences of\nasymptotically good quantum codes.\n", "  The quasi-probabilistic Wigner distributions are the quantum mechanical\nanalog of the classical phase-space distributions. We investigate quark Wigner\ndistributions for a quark state dressed with a gluon, which can be thought of\nas a simple composite and relativistic spin-1/2 state with a gluonic degree of\nfreedom. We calculate various polarization configurations, namely unpolarized,\nlongitudinally polarized and transversely polarized quark and the target state\nusing light-front wave functions in this model. At leading twist, one can\ndefine 16 quark Wigner distributions, however, we obtain only 8 independent\nnon-zero Wigner distributions in our model. We compare our results with other\nmodel calculations for the proton.\n", "  The present panorama of HPC architectures is extremely heterogeneous, ranging\nfrom traditional multi-core CPU processors, supporting a wide class of\napplications but delivering moderate computing performance, to many-core GPUs,\nexploiting aggressive data-parallelism and delivering higher performances for\nstreaming computing applications. In this scenario, code portability (and\nperformance portability) become necessary for easy maintainability of\napplications; this is very relevant in scientific computing where code changes\nare very frequent, making it tedious and prone to error to keep different code\nversions aligned. In this work we present the design and optimization of a\nstate-of-the-art production-level LQCD Monte Carlo application, using the\ndirective-based OpenACC programming model. OpenACC abstracts parallel\nprogramming to a descriptive level, relieving programmers from specifying how\ncodes should be mapped onto the target architecture. We describe the\nimplementation of a code fully written in OpenACC, and show that we are able to\ntarget several different architectures, including state-of-the-art traditional\nCPUs and GPUs, with the same code. We also measure performance, evaluating the\ncomputing efficiency of our OpenACC code on several architectures, comparing\nwith GPU-specific implementations and showing that a good level of\nperformance-portability can be reached.\n", "  The discovery of lepton flavour violating interactions will be striking\nevidence for physics beyond the Standard Model. Focusing on the three decays\n$\\tau^\\mp \\to \\mu^\\pm \\mu^\\mp \\mu^\\mp$, $\\tau^\\mp \\to e^\\pm \\mu^\\mp \\mu^\\mp$\nand $\\tau^\\mp \\to e^\\mp \\mu^\\mp \\mu^\\pm$, we evaluate the discovery potential\nof current and future high-energy colliders to probe lepton flavour violation\nin the $\\tau$ sector. Based on this potential we determine the expected\nconstraints on parameters of new physics in the context of the Type-II Seesaw\nModel, the Left-Right Symmetric Model, and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel. The existing and ongoing 13 TeV run of the Large Hadron Collider has the\npotential to produce constraints that outperform the existing $e^+ e^-$\ncollider limits for the $\\tau^\\mp \\to \\mu^\\pm \\mu^\\mp \\mu^\\mp$ decay and\nachieve a branching fraction limit of $\\lesssim 10^{-8}$. With a future\ncircular $e^+ e^-$ collider, constraints on the $\\tau \\to l \\mu \\mu$ branching\nfractions could reach as low as a few times $10^{-12}$.\n", "  We study a multi-parametric family of quadratic algebras in four generators,\nwhich includes coordinate algebras of noncommutative four-planes and, as\nquotient algebras, noncommutative three spheres. Particular subfamilies\ncomprise Sklyanin algebras and Connes--Dubois-Violette planes. We determine\nquantum groups of symmetries for the general algebras and construct\nfinite-dimensional covariant differential calculi.\n", "  We study the tensor-optimized antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (TOAMD) as a\nsuccessive variational method in many-body systems with strong interaction for\nnuclei. In TOAMD, the correlation functions for the tensor force and the\nshort-range repulsion and their multiples are operated to the AMD state as the\nvariational wave function. The total wave function is expressed as the sum of\nall the components and the variational space can be increased successively with\nthe multiple correlation functions to achieve convergence. All the necessary\nmatrix elements of many-body operators, consisting of the multiple correlation\nfunctions and the Hamiltonian, are expressed analytically using the Gaussian\nintegral formula. In this paper we show the results of TOAMD with up to the\ndouble products of the correlation functions for the s-shell nuclei, 3H and\n4He, using the nucleon-nucleon interaction AV8'. It is found that the energies\nand Hamiltonian components of two nuclei converge rapidly with respect to the\nmultiple of correlation functions. This result indicates the efficiency of\nTOAMD for the power series expansion in terms of the tensor and short-range\ncorrelation functions.\n", "  A double-rephasing photon-echo (DRPE) scheme inherently satisfies\nno-population inversion condition for quantum memory applications, while the\nresultant absorptive coherence prohibits echo radiation out of the medium. To\nsolve the absorptive echo problem in the DRPE scheme, a controlled\ndouble-rephasing echo protocol has been presented and discussed for the\ncollective atom phase control. In the DRPE scheme, however, a typical Gaussian\nlight can cause imperfect rephasing processes resulting in a partial emission\nof photon echoes. Here, the rephasing process of individual ensemble atoms is\nthoroughly investigated to discuss the unpermitted echo observations in the\nDRPE scheme, where its maximum efficiency is as high as 26% in amplitude.\n", "  It is pointed out that a bino-dominated well-tempered bino-higgsino in the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with heavy non-SM- like scalars\ncan satisfy the 2016 LUX constraints on the scattering cross-section of dark\nmatter on nuclei only if $\\tan\\beta$ is smaller than about 3. This, together\nwith the Higgs mass constraint, sets a lower bound on the stops masses of about\n25 TeV. The LUX constraints can be satisfied for larger $\\tan\\beta$ if the\nnon-SM-like Higgs bosons are light enough. However, this region of parameter\nspace is strongly constrained by recent LHC results of the Higgs boson\nsearches. Satisfying both the LUX and LHC constraints requires the non-SM-like\nHiggs bosons to be lighter than about 400 GeV and $\\tan\\beta$ below about 8.\nThis implies a lower bound on the stop masses of about 1.5 TeV. This small\ncorner of the parameter space will be probed in the near future by the direct\ndetection experiments, the LHC Higgs searches and precision Higgs coupling\nmeasurements. The recent LUX constraints improved also the lower mass limit on\nhiggsino-dominated well-tempered neutralino to about 950 (900) GeV with heavy\n(light) MSSM-like Higgs doublet, assuming the stop masses below 10 TeV.\n", "  We investigate the Wigner distributions for $u$ and $d$ quarks in a\nlight-front quark-diquark model of a proton to unravel the spatial and spin\nstructure. The light-front wave functions are modeled from the soft-wall\nAdS/QCD prediction. We consider the contributions from both the scalar and the\naxial vector diquarks. The Wigner distributions for unpolarized, longitudinally\npolarized, and transversely polarized protons are presented in the transverse\nmomentum plane as well as in the transverse impact parameter plane. The Wigner\ndistributions satisfy a Soffer-bound-type inequality. We also evaluate all the\nleading twist GTMDs and show their scale evolution. The spin-spin correlations\nbetween the quark and the proton are investigated\n", "  We present cosmological constraints on the scalar-tensor theory of gravity by\nanalyzing the angular power spectrum data of the cosmic microwave background\nobtained from the Planck 2015 results together with the baryon acoustic\noscillations (BAO) data. We find that the inclusion of the BAO data improves\nthe constraints on the time variation of the effective gravitational constant\nby more than $10\\%$, that is, the time variation of the effective gravitational\nconstant between the recombination and the present epochs is constrained as\n$G_{\\rm rec}/G_0-1 <1.9\\times 10^{-3}\\ (95.45\\%\\ {\\rm C.L.})$ and $G_{\\rm\nrec}/G_0-1 <5.5\\times 10^{-3}\\ (99.99 \\%\\ {\\rm C.L.})$. We also discuss the\ndependence of the constraints on the choice of the prior.\n", "  Right-handed sneutrinos are natural components of left-right symmetric\nsupersymmetric models where the gauge sector is extended to include\nright-handed weak interactions. Unlike in other models where right-handed\nsneutrinos are gauge singlets, here the right sneutrino is part of a doublet\nand could be a dark matter candidate whose annihilation proceeds via gauge\ninteractions. We investigate this possibility, and find that relic density,\nlow-energy observable and direct supersymmetry search constraints can be\nsatisfied when the lightest supersymmetric particle is a right-handed\nsneutrino. We introduce benchmarks for left-right supersymmetric realizations\nwhere either a sneutrino or a neutralino is the lightest superpartner. We then\nstudy the LHC signals arising through resonant right-handed slepton production\nvia a $W_R$ gauge-boson exchange that lead to final states enriched in leptons,\nadditionally containing a large amount of missing transverse momentum, and\nfeaturing a low jet multiplicity. We find that such a resonant production would\nboost the chances of discovering these weakly interacting supersymmetric\nparticles for a mass range extending beyond 1 TeV already with a luminosity of\n100 fb$^{-1}$. Finally, we compare sneutrino versus neutralino scenarios, and\ncomment on differences with other sneutrino dark matter models.\n", "  Magnetic nanoparticles are important building blocks for future technologies\nranging from nano-medicine to spintronics. Many related applications require\nnanoparticles with tailored magnetic properties. However, despite significant\nefforts undertaken towards this goal, a broad and poorly-understood dispersion\nof magnetic properties is reported, even within mono-disperse samples of the\ncanonical ferromagnetic 3d transition metals. We address this issue by\ninvestigating the magnetism of a large number of size- and shape-selected,\nindividual nanoparticles of Fe, Co, and Ni using a unique set of complementary\ncharacterization techniques. At room temperature only superparamagnetic\nbehavior is observed in our experiments for all Ni nanoparticles within the\ninvestigated sizes, which range from 8 to 20 nm. However, Fe and Co\nnanoparticles can exist in two distinct magnetic states at any size in this\nrange: (i) a superparamagnetic state as expected from the bulk and surface\nanisotropies known for the respective materials and as observed for Ni; and\n(ii) a state with unexpected stable magnetization at room temperature. This\nstriking state is assigned to significant modifications of the magnetic\nproperties arising from metastable lattice defects in the core of the\nnanoparticles as concluded by calculations and atomic structural\ncharacterization. Also related with the structural defects, we find that the\nmagnetic state of Fe and Co nanoparticles can be tuned by thermal treatment\nenabling one to tailor their magnetic properties for applications. This work\ndemonstrates the importance of complementary single particle investigations for\na better understanding of nanoparticle magnetism and for full exploration of\ntheir potential for applications.\n", "  For ultrarelativistic proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, we perform\nan exploratory study of the contribution to the elliptic flow $v_2$ coming from\nthe orientation of the momentum of the produced particles with respect to the\nreaction plane. Via the CGC factorization valid at high energies, this\ncontribution is related to the orientation of a color dipole with respect to\nits impact parameter, which in turn probes the transverse inhomogeneity in the\ntarget. Using the McLerran-Venugopalan model (with impact-parameter dependence)\nas an effective description for the soft gluon distribution in the (proton or\nnuclear) target, we present a semi-analytic calculation of the dipole\nscattering amplitude, including its angular dependence. We find that the\nangular dependence is controlled by soft gluon exchanges and hence is genuinely\nnon-perturbative. The effects of multiple scattering turn out to be essential\n(in particular, they change the sign of $v_2$). We find that sizable values for\n$v_2$, comparable to those observed in the LHC data and having a similar\ndependence upon the transverse momenta of the produced particles, can be easily\ngenerated via peripheral collisions. In particular, $v_2$ develops a peak at a\ntransverse momentum which scales with the saturation momentum in the target.\n", "  The main difficulty for path integral Monte Carlo studies of Fermi systems\nresults from the requirement of antisymmetrization of the density matrix and is\nknown in literature as the 'sign problem'. To overcome this issue the new\nnumerical version of the %{\\large {\\tiny {\\Huge }}} Wigner approach to quantum\nmechanics for treatment thermodynamic properties of degenerate systems of\nfermions has been developed. The new path integral representation of quantum\nWigner function in the phase space has been obtained for canonical ensemble.\nExplicit analytical expression of the Wigner function accounting for Fermi\nstatistical effects by effective pair pseudopotential has been proposed.\nDerived pseudopotential depends on coordinates, momenta and degeneracy\nparameter of fermions and takes into account Pauli blocking of fermions in\nphase space. The new quantum Monte-Carlo method for calculations of average\nvalues of arbitrary quantum operators has been proposed. To test the developed\napproach calculations of the momentum distribution function of the degenerate\nideal system of Fermi particles has been carried out in a good agreement with\nanalytical Fermi distributions. Generalization of this approach for studies\ninfluence of interparticle interaction on momentum distribution functions of\nstrongly coupled Fermi system is in progress.\n", "  Density-wave fronts in a vibrofluidized wet granular layer undergoing a\ngas-liquid-like transition are investigated experimentally. The threshold of\nthe instability is governed by the amplitude of the vertical vibrations.\nFronts, which are curved into a spiral shape, propagate coherently along the\ncircular rim of the container with leading edges. They are stable beyond a\ncritical distance from the container center. Based on an analysis of the\nemerging time and length scales, we propose a model for the pattern formation\nby considering the competition between the time scale for the condensation of\nwet granular particles from a gas-like state and that of the energy injection\nresisting this process.\n", "  Rocky planets orbiting M-dwarf stars in the habitable zone tend to be driven\nto synchronous rotation by tidal dissipation, potentially causing difficulties\nfor maintaining a habitable climate on the planet. However, the planet may be\ncaptured into asynchronous spin-orbit resonances, and this capture may be more\nlikely if the planet has a sufficiently large intrinsic triaxial deformation.\nWe derive the analytic expression for the maximum triaxiality of a rocky\nplanet, with and without a liquid envelope, as a function of the planet's\nradius, density, rigidity and critical strain of fracture. The derived maximum\ntriaxiality is consistent with the observed triaxialities for terrestrial\nplanets in the solar system, and indicates that rocky planets in the habitable\nzone of M-dwarfs can in principle be in a state of asynchronous spin-orbit\nresonances.\n", "  Recent chemical exfoliation of layered MAX phase compounds to novel\ntwo-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, so called MXenes, has\nbrought new opportunity to materials science and technology. This review\nhighlights the computational attempts that have been made to understand the\nphysics and chemistry of this very promising family of advanced two-dimensional\nmaterials, and to exploit their novel and exceptional properties for electronic\nand energy harvesting applications.\n", "  It is shown that the serious problem on the cosmological tension between the\ndirect measurements of the Hubble constant at present and the constant derived\nfrom the Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies can be solved by\nconsidering the renormalized model parameters. They are deduced by taking the\nspatial average of second-order perturbations in the flat Lambda-CDM model,\nwhich includes random adiabatic fluctuations.\n", "  We study model-theoretical structures for prototypical physical systems.\nFirst, a summary of the model theory of sheaves, adapted to the metric case, is\npresented. In particular, we provide conditions for a generalization of the\ngeneric model theorem to metric sheaves. The essentials of the model theory of\nmetric sheaves appeared in the form of Conference Proceedings. We provide a\nversion of those results, for the sake of completeness, and then build metric\nsheaves for physical systems in the second part of the paper. Specifically,\nmetric sheaves for quantum mechanical systems with pure point and continuous\nspectra are constructed. In the former case, every fiber is a finite projective\nHilbert space determined by the family of invariant subspaces of a given\noperator with pure point spectrum, and we also consider unitary transformations\nin a finite-dimensional space. For an operator with continuous spectrum, every\nfiber is a two sorted structure of subsets of the Schwartz space of rapidly\ndecreasing functions that includes imperfect representations of position and\nmomentum states. The imperfection character is parametrically determined by the\nelements on the base space and refined in the generic model. Position and\nmomentum operators find a simple representation in every fiber as well as their\ncorresponding unitary operators. These results follow after recasting the\nalgebraic properties of the integral transformations frequently invoked in the\ndescription of quantum mechanical systems with continuous spectra. Finally, we\nillustrate how this construction permits the calculation of the quantum\nmechanical propagator for a free particle.\n", "  A novel and simple superbunching pseudothermal light source is introduced\nbased on common instruments such as laser, lens, pinhole and groundglass.\n$g^{(2)}(0)=3.66 \\pm 0.02$ is observed in the suggested scheme by employing two\nrotating groundglass. Quantum and classical theories are employed to interpret\nthe observed superbunching effect. It is predicted that $g^{(2)}(0)$ can reach\n$2^N$ if $N$ rotating groundglass were employed. These results are helpful to\nunderstand the physics of superbunching. The proposed superbunching\npseudothermal light may serve as a new type of light to study the second- and\nhigher-order coherence of light and have potential application in improving the\nvisibility of thermal light ghost imaging.\n", "  The remarkable properties of graphene are inherent to its 2D honeycomb\nlattice structure. Its low dimensionality, which makes it possible to rearrange\nthe atoms by applying an external force, offers the intriguing prospect of\nmechanically controlling the electronic properties. In the presence of strain,\ngraphene develops a pseudo-magnetic field (PMF) which reconstructs the band\nstructure into pseudo Landau levels (PLLs). However, a feasible route to\nrealizing, characterizing and controlling PMFs is still lacking. Here we report\non a method to generate and characterize PMFs in a graphene membrane supported\non nano-pillars. A direct measure of the local strain is achieved by using the\nmagnifying effect of the Moir\\'e pattern formed against a hexagonal Boron\nNitride (hBN) substrate under scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We quantify\nthe strain induced PMF through the PLLs spectra observed in scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy (STS). This work provides a pathway to strain induced engineering\nand electro-mechanical graphene based devices.\n", "  Thrombosis is a common complication following the surgical implantation of\nblood contacting devices, and is strongly influenced by the phenomenon of\nnear-wall enrichment of platelets. This paper describes a multi-constituent\ncontinuum approach to study this phenomenon. A mixture-theory model is used to\ndescribe the motion of the plasma and the red blood cells (RBCs) and the\ninteractions between the two components. A transport model is developed to\nstudy the influence of the RBC field on the platelets. The model is used to\nstudy blood flow in a rectangular micro-channel, a sudden expansion\nmicro-channel, and a channel containing micro crevices (representing a\npractical problem encountered in most blood-wetted devices). The simulations\nshow that in the rectangular channel the concentration of platelets near the\nwalls is about five times higher than the concentration near the centerline of\nthe channel. It is also noticed that in the channel with crevices, extremely a\nlarge number of platelets accumulate in the deep part of the crevices and this\nmay serve as the nidus for thrombosis occurring in medical devices.\n  Keywords: Platelets; Blood flow; RBCs; Micro-channel; Mixture theory;\nTwo-fluids; Thrombosis\n", "  We study the non-linear realisation of E11 originally proposed by West with\nparticular emphasis on the issue of linearised gauge invariance. Our analysis\nshows even at low levels that the conjectured equations can only be invariant\nunder local gauge transformations if a certain section condition that has\nappeared in a different context in the E11 literature is satisfied. This\nsection condition also generalises the one known from exceptional field theory.\nEven with the section condition, the E11 duality equation for gravity is known\nto miss the trace component of the spin connection. We propose an extended\nscheme based on an infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebra, called the tensor\nhierarchy algebra, that incorporates the section condition and resolves the\nabove issue. The tensor hierarchy algebra defines a generalised differential\ncomplex, which provides a systematic description of gauge invariance and\nBianchi identities. It furthermore provides an E11 representation for the field\nstrengths, for which we define a twisted first order self-duality equation\nunderlying the dynamics.\n", "  The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding of a qubit within an oscillator\nprovides a number of advantages when used in a fault-tolerant architecture for\nquantum computing, most notably that Gaussian operations suffice to implement\nall single- and two-qubit Clifford gates. The main drawback of the encoding is\nthat the logical states themselves are challenging to produce. Here we present\na method for generating optical GKP-encoded qubits by coupling an atomic\nensemble to a squeezed state of light. Particular outcomes of a subsequent spin\nmeasurement of the ensemble herald successful generation of the resource state\nin the optical mode. We analyze the method in terms of the resources required\n(total spin and amount of squeezing) and the probability of success. We propose\na physical implementation using a Faraday-based quantum non-demolition\ninteraction.\n", "  We study a model of quantum mechanical fermions with matrix-like index\nstructure (with indices $N$ and $L$) and quartic interactions, recently\nintroduced by Anninos and Silva. We compute the partition function exactly with\n$q$-deformed orthogonal polynomials (Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials), for\ndifferent values of $L$ and arbitrary $N$. From the explicit evaluation of the\nthermal partition function, the energy levels and degeneracies are determined.\nFor a given $L$, the number of states of different energy is quadratic in $N$,\nwhich implies an exponential degeneracy of the energy levels. We also show that\nat high-temperature we have a Gaussian matrix model, which implies a symmetry\nthat swaps $N$ and $L$, together with a Wick rotation of the spectral\nparameter. In this limit, we also write the partition function, for generic $L$\nand $N,$ in terms of a single generalized Hermite polynomial.\n", "  Over the past decade, extensive studies have been undertaken to search for\nphoton signals from dark matter annihilation or decay for dark matter particle\nmasses above $\\sim1$ GeV. However, due to the lacking sensitivity of current\nexperiments at MeV-GeV energies, sometimes dubbed the 'MeV gap', dark matter\nmodels with MeV to sub-GeV particle masses have received little attention so\nfar. Various proposed MeV missions (like, e.g., e-ASTROGAM or AMEGO) are aimed\nat closing this gap in the mid- or long-term future. This, and the absence of\nclear dark matter signals in the GeV-TeV range, makes it relevant to carefully\nreconsider the expected experimental instrumental sensitivities in this mass\nrange. The most common two-body annihilation channels for sub-GeV dark matter\nare to neutrinos, electrons, pions or directly to photons. Among these, only\nthe electron channel has been extensively studied, and almost exclusively in\nthe context of the 511 keV line. In this work, we study the prospects for\ndetecting MeV dark matter annihilation in general in future MeV missions, using\ne-ASTROGAM as reference, and focusing on dark matter masses in the range 1\nMeV-3 GeV. In the case of leptonic annihilation, we emphasise the importance of\nthe often overlooked bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation spectral\nfeatures, which in many cases provide the dominant gamma-ray signal in this\nregime.\n", "  In this contribution, we discuss the cosmological scenario where unstable\ndomain walls are formed in the early universe and their late-time annihilation\nproduces a significant amount of gravitational waves. After describing\ncosmological constraints on long-lived domain walls, we estimate the typical\namplitude and frequency of gravitational waves observed today. We also review\npossible extensions of the standard model of particle physics that predict the\nformation of unstable domain walls and can be probed by observation of relic\ngravitational waves. It is shown that recent results of pulser timing arrays\nand direct detection experiments partially exclude the relevant parameter\nspace, and that a much wider parameter space can be covered by the next\ngeneration of gravitational wave observatories.\n", "  We report on quantum frequency conversion of near-infrared photons from a\nwavelength of 854nm to the telecommunication O-band at 1310nm with 8% overall\nconversion efficiency. Entangled photon pairs at 854nm are generated via\ntype-II spontaneous parametric down conversion. One photon is mixed with a\nstrong pump field in a nonlinear ridge waveguide for its conversion to 1310nm.\nWe demonstrate preservation of first and second order coherence of the photons\nin the conversion process. Based on this we infer the coherence function of the\ntwo-photon state and compare it with the actual measured one. This measurement\ndemonstrates preservation of time-energy entanglement of the pair. With 88%\nvisibility we violate a Bell inequality.\n", "  Two-Line Elements (TLEs) continue to be the sole public source of orbiter\nobservations. The accuracy of TLE propagations through the Simplified General\nPerturbations-4 (SGP4) software decreases dramatically as the propagation\nhorizon increases, and thus the period of validity of TLEs is very limited. As\na result, TLEs are gradually becoming insufficient for the growing demands of\nSpace Situational Awareness (SSA). We propose a technique, based on the hybrid\npropagation methodology, aimed at extending TLE validity with minimal changes\nto the current TLE-SGP4 system in a non-intrusive way. It requires that the\ninstitution in possession of the osculating elements distributes hybrid TLEs,\nHTLEs, which encapsulate the standard TLE and the model of its propagation\nerror. The validity extension can be accomplished when the end user processes\nHTLEs through the hybrid SGP4 propagator, HSGP4, which comprises the standard\nSGP4 and an error corrector.\n", "  In this work we investigate the potential of tetragonal L1$_0$ ordered FeNi\nas candidate phase for rare earth free permanent magnets taking into account\nanisotropy values from recently synthesized, partially ordered FeNi thin films.\nIn particular, we estimate the maximum energy product ($BH$)$_\\mathrm{max}$ of\nL1$_0$-FeNi nanostructures using micromagnetic simulations. The maximum energy\nproduct is limited due to the small coercive field of partially ordered\nL1$_0$-FeNi. Nano-structured magnets consisting of 128 equi-axed, platelet-like\nand columnar-shaped grains show a theoretical maximum energy product of 228\nkJ/m$^3$, 208 kJ/m$^3$, 252 kJ/m$^3$, respectively.\n", "  This article proposes a process to reconstruct a Riemann surface with\nboundary equipped with a conductivity tensor from its boundary and its\nDirichlet-Neumann operator. When initial data comes from a two dimensional real\nRiemannian oriented surface equipped with a conductivity tensor, this process\nrecover the whole of what can be determined from this data.\n", "  Group I elements - alkali metals Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs - are examples of\nsimple metals with one s electron in the valence band. Under pressure these\nelements display unusually complex structural behaviour transforming from\nclose-packed to low symmetry open structures. Unexpectedly complex form was\nfound for melting curves of alkalis under compression with initial increasing\nin accordance to Lindemann criterion and further decreasing to very low melting\npoint. To understand complex and low symmetry structures in compressed alkalis\na transformation of the electron energy levels was suggested which involves an\noverlap between the valence band and outer core electrons. Within the model of\nthe Fermi sphere - Brillouin zone interaction one can understand the complex\nmelting curve of alkalis.\n", "  We consider a modification to the standard cosmological history consisting of\nintroducing a new species $\\phi$ whose energy density red-shifts with the scale\nfactor $a$ like $\\rho_\\phi \\propto a^{-(4+n)}$. For $n>0$, such a red-shift is\nfaster than radiation, hence the new species dominates the energy budget of the\nuniverse at early times while it is completely negligible at late times. If\nequality with the radiation energy density is achieved at low enough\ntemperatures, dark matter can be produced as a thermal relic during the new\ncosmological phase. Dark matter freeze-out then occurs at higher temperatures\ncompared to the standard case, implying that reproducing the observed abundance\nrequires significantly larger annihilation rates. Here, we point out a\ncompletely new phenomenon, which we refer to as $\\textit{relentless}$ dark\nmatter: for large enough $n$, unlike the standard case where annihilation ends\nshortly after the departure from thermal equilibrium, dark matter particles\nkeep annihilating long after leaving chemical equilibrium, with a significant\ndepletion of the final relic abundance. Relentless annihilation occurs for $n\n\\geq 2$ and $n \\geq 4$ for s-wave and p-wave annihilation, respectively, and it\nthus occurs in well motivated scenarios such as a quintessence with a kination\nphase. We discuss a few microscopic realizations for the new cosmological\ncomponent and highlight the phenomenological consequences of our calculations\nfor dark matter searches.\n", "  We present constraints on the annihilation cross section of WIMP dark matter\nbased on the joint statistical analysis of four dwarf galaxies with VERITAS.\nThese results are derived from an optimized photon weighting statistical\ntechnique that improves on standard imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope\n(IACT) analyses by utilizing the spectral and spatial properties of individual\nphoton events. We report on the results of $\\sim$230 hours of observations of\nfive dwarf galaxies and the joint statistical analysis of four of the dwarf\ngalaxies. We find no evidence of gamma-ray emission from any individual dwarf\nnor in the joint analysis. The derived upper limit on the dark matter\nannihilation cross section from the joint analysis is $1.35\\times 10^{-23}\n{\\mathrm{ cm^3s^{-1}}}$ at 1 TeV for the bottom quark ($b\\bar{b}$) final state,\n$2.85\\times 10^{-24}{\\mathrm{ cm^3s^{-1}}}$ at 1 TeV for the tau lepton\n($\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$) final state and $1.32\\times 10^{-25}{\\mathrm{\ncm^3s^{-1}}}$ at 1 TeV for the gauge boson ($\\gamma\\gamma$) final state.\n", "  We extend the idea of mimetic gravity to a Randall-Sundrum II braneworld\nmodel. As for the 4-dimensional mimetic gravity, we isolate the conformal\ndegree of freedom of 5-dimensional gravity in a covariant manner. We assume the\nbulk metric to be made up of a non-dynamical scalar field $\\Phi$ and an\nauxiliary metric $\\tilde{{\\cal{G}}}_{AB}$ so that ${\\cal{G}}_{AB}=\n\\tilde{{\\cal{G}}}^{CD}\\,\\Phi_{,C}\\,\\Phi_{,D}\\,\\tilde{{\\cal{G}}}_{AB}$ where $A,\nB, ...$ are the bulk spacetime indices. Then we show that the induced conformal\ndegree of freedom on the brane as an induced scalar field, plays the role of a\nmimetic field on the brane. In fact, we suppose that the scalar degree of\nfreedom which mimics the dark sectors on the brane has its origin on the bulk\nscalar field, $\\Phi$. By adopting some suitable mimetic potentials on the\nbrane, we show that this brane mimetic field explains the late time cosmic\nexpansion in the favor of observational data: the equation of state parameter\nof this field crosses the cosmological constant line in near past from\nquintessence to phantom phase in a redshift well in the range of observation.\nWe show also that this induced mimetic scalar field has the capability to\nexplain initial time cosmological inflation. We study parameter space of the\nmodels numerically in order to constraint the models with Planck2015 data set.\n", "  Large-area ($\\sim$cm$^2$) films of vertical heterostructures formed by\nalternating graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenide(TMD) alloys are\nobtained by wet chemical routes followed by a thermal treatment at low\ntemperature (300 $^\\circ$C). In particular, we synthesized stacked graphene and\nW$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ alloy phases that were used as hydrogen evolution\ncatalysts. We observed a Tafel slope of 38.7 mV dec$^{-1}$ and 96 mV onset\npotential (at current density of 10 mA cm$^{-2}$) when the heterostructure\nalloy is annealed at 300 $^o$C. These results indicate that heterostructure\nformed by graphene and W$_{0.4}$Mo$_{0.6}$S$_2$ alloys are far more efficient\nthan WS$_2$ and MoS$_2$ by at least a factor of two, and it is superior than\nany other reported TMD system. This strategy offers a cheap and low temperature\nsynthesis alternative able to replace Pt in the hydrogen evolution reaction\n(HER). Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the alloy is stable over time,\ni.e. the catalytic activity does not experience a significant change even after\n1000 cycles. Using density functional theory calculations, we found that this\nenhanced hydrogen evolution in the W$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ alloys is mainly due to\nthe lower energy barrier created by a favorable overlap of the d-orbitals from\nthe transition metals and the s-orbitals of H$_2$, with the lowest energy\nbarrier occurring for W$_{0.4}$Mo$_{0.6}$S$_2$ alloy. Thus, it is now possible\nto further improve the performance of the \"inert\" TMD basal plane via metal\nalloying, in addition to the previously reported strategies of creation of\npoint defects, vacancies and edges. The synthesis of\ngraphene/W$_{0.4}$Mo$_{0.6}$S$_2$ produced at relatively low temperatures is\nscalable and could be used as an effective low cost Pt-free catalyst.\n", "  We study the problem of distinguishing maximally entangled quantum states by\nusing local operations and classical communication (LOCC). A question of\nfundamental interest is whether any three maximally entangled states in\n$\\mathbb{C}^d\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^d (d\\geq 4)$ are distinguishable by LOCC. In\nthis paper, we restrict ourselves to consider the generalized Bell states. And\nwe prove that any three generalized Bell states in\n$\\mathbb{C}^d\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^d (d\\geq 4)$ are locally distinguishable.\n", "  Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are silicon sensors with a built-in\ncharge multiplication layer providing a gain of typically 10 to 50. Due to the\ncombination of high signal-to-noise ratio and short rise time, thin LGADs\nprovide good time resolutions.\n  LGADs with an active thickness of about 45 $\\mu$m were produced at CNM\nBarcelona. Their gains and time resolutions were studied in beam tests for two\ndifferent multiplication layer implantation doses, as well as before and after\nirradiation with neutrons up to $10^{15}$ n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$.\n  The gain showed the expected decrease at a fixed voltage for a lower initial\nimplantation dose, as well as for a higher fluence due to effective acceptor\nremoval in the multiplication layer. Time resolutions below 30 ps were obtained\nat the highest applied voltages for both implantation doses before irradiation.\nAlso after an intermediate fluence of $3\\times10^{14}$ n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$, similar\nvalues were measured since a higher applicable reverse bias voltage could\nrecover most of the pre-irradiation gain. At $10^{15}$ n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$, the\ntime resolution at the maximum applicable voltage of 620 V during the beam test\nwas measured to be 57 ps since the voltage stability was not good enough to\ncompensate for the gain layer loss. The time resolutions were found to follow\napproximately a universal function of gain for all implantation doses and\nfluences.\n", "  Using axisymmetric simulations coupling special relativistic MHD, an\napproximate post-Newtonian gravitational potential and two-moment neutrino\ntransport, we show different paths for the formation of either protomagnetars\nor stellar mass black holes. The fraction of prototypical stellar cores which\nshould result in collapsars depends on a combination of several factors, among\nwhich the structure of the progenitor star and the profile of specific angular\nmomentum are probably the foremost. Along with the implosion of the stellar\ncore, we also obtain supernova-like explosions driven by neutrino heating and\nhydrodynamic instabilities or by magneto-rotational effects in cores of\nhigh-mass stars. In the latter case, highly collimated, mildly relativistic\noutflows are generated. We find that after a rather long post-collapse phase\n(lasting >~ 1 sec) black holes may form in cases both of successful and failed\nsupernovalike explosions. A basic trend is that cores with a specific angular\nmomentum smaller than that obtained by standard, one-dimensional stellar\nevolution calculations form black holes (and eventually collapsars).\nComplementary, protomagnetars result from stellar cores with the standard\ndistribution of specific angular momentum obtained from prototypical stellar\nevolution calculations including magnetic torques and moderate to large mass\nloss rates.\n", "  Recent observations show that the electromagnetic fine-structure constant,\n$\\alpha_e$, may vary with space and time. In the framework of Finsler\nspacetime, we propose here an anisotropic cosmological model, in which both the\nspatial and temporal variations of $\\alpha_e$ are allowed. Our model naturally\nleads to the dipole structure of $\\alpha_e$, and predicts that the dipole\namplitude increases with time. We fit our model to the most up-to-date\nmeasurements of $\\alpha_e$ from the quasar absorption lines. It is found that\nthe dipole direction points towards\n$(l,b)=(330.2^\\circ\\pm7.3^\\circ,-13.0^\\circ\\pm5.6^\\circ)$ in the galactic\ncoordinates, and the anisotropic parameter is $b_0=(0.47\\pm 0.09)\n\\times10^{-5}$, which corresponds to a dipole amplitude $(7.2\\pm 1.4)\\times\n10^{-8}$ at redshift $z=0.015$. This is well consistent with the upper limit of\nthe variation of $\\alpha_e$ measured in the Milky Way. We also fit our model to\nthe Union2.1 type Ia supernovae, and find that the preferred direction of\nUnion2.1 is well consistent with the dipole direction of $\\alpha_e$.\n", "  L\\'evy flights and L\\'evy walks serve as two paradigms of random walks\nresembling common features but also bearing fundamental differences. One of the\nmain dissimilarities are discontinuity versus continuity of their trajectories\nand infinite versus finite propagation velocity. In consequence, well developed\ntheory of L\\'evy flights is associated with their pathological physical\nproperties, which in turn are resolved by the concept of L\\'evy walks. Here, we\nexplore L\\'evy flights and L\\'evy walks models on bounded domains examining\ntheir differences and analogies. We investigate analytically and numerically\nwhether and under which conditions both approaches yield similar results in\nterms of selected statistical observables characterizing the motion: the\nsurvival probability, mean first passage time and stationary PDFs. It is\ndemonstrated that similarity of models is affected by the type of boundary\nconditions and value of the stability index defining asymptotics of the jump\nlength distribution.\n", "  Neutrino mass sum rules have recently gained again more attention as a\npowerful tool to discriminate and test various flavour models in the near\nfuture. A related question which was not yet discussed fully satisfactorily was\nthe origin of these sum rules and if they are related to any residual or\naccidental symmetry. We will address this open issue here systematically and\nfind previous statements confirmed. Namely, that the sum rules are not related\nto any enhanced symmetry of the Lagrangian after family symmetry breaking but\nthat they are simply the result of a reduction of free parameters due to\nskillful model building.\n", "  It is a longstanding debate concerning the absence of threshold for the\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible spreading model on networks with localized\nstate. The key to resolve this controversy is the dynamical interaction\npattern, which has not been uncovered. Here we show that the interaction\ndriving the localized-endemic state transition is not the global interaction\nbetween a node and all the other nodes on the network, but exists at the level\nof super node composed of highly connected node and its neighbors. The internal\ninteractions within a super node induce localized state with limited lifetime,\nwhile the interactions between neighboring super nodes via a path of two hops\nenable them to avoid trapping in the absorbing state, marking the onset of\nendemic state. The hybrid interactions render highly connected nodes\nexponentially increasing infection density, which truly account for the null\nthreshold. These results are crucial for correctly understanding diverse\nrecurrent contagion phenomena\n", "  The simplest gauge gravitation theory in Riemann-Cartan space-time leading to\nthe solution of the problem of cosmological singularity and dark energy problem\nis investigated with purpose to solve the dark matter problem. It is shown that\nthe interaction of the vacuum torsion field with proper angular moments of\ngravitating objects can lead to appearance at astrophysical scale (galaxies,\ngalactic clusters) additional force of gravitational attraction, which in the\nframe of standard theory is connected with dark matter.\n", "  This thesis presents our results on Liouville integrable systems of\nCalogero-Ruijsenaars type: 1. We prove an explicit formula providing canonical\nspectral coordinates for the rational Calogero-Moser system. 2. We explore\naction-angle duality for the trigonometric BC(n) Sutherland system using\nHamiltonian reduction. 3. We derive a Poisson-Lie deformation of the\ntrigonometric BC(n) Sutherland system using Hamiltonian reduction. 4. We\nconstruct a Lax pair for the hyperbolic Ruijsenaars-Schneider system with two\ncouplings. 5. We present an explicit construction of compactified trigonometric\nand elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider systems.\n", "  The conversion of other forms of energy into mechanical work through the\ngeometrical extension and retraction of nanomaterials has a wide variety of\npotential applications, including for mimicking biomotors. Here, using\nmolecular dynamic simulations, we demonstrate that there exists an intrinsic\nenergy conversion mechanism between thermal energy and mechanical work in the\ntelescopic motions of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). A DWCNT can\ninherently convert heat into mechanical work in its telescopic extension\nprocess, while convert mechanical energy into heat in its telescopic retraction\nprocess. These two processes are thermodynamically reversible. The underlying\nmechanism for this reversibility is that the entropy changes with the\ntelescopic overlapping length of concentric individual tubes. We find also that\nthe entropy effect enlarges with the decreasing intertube space of DWCNTs. As a\nresult, the spontaneously telescopic motion of a condensed DWCNT can be\nswitched to extrusion by rising the system temperature above a critical value.\nThese findings are important for fundamentally understanding the mechanical\nbehavior of concentric nanotubes, and may have general implications in the\napplication of DWCNTs as linear motors in nanodevices.\n", "  We combine samples of nearby galaxies with Herschel photometry selected on\ntheir dust, metal, HI, and stellar mass content, and compare these to chemical\nevolution models in order to discriminate between different dust sources. In a\ncompanion paper, we used a HI-selected sample of nearby galaxies to reveal a\nsub-sample of very gas rich (gas fraction > 80 per cent) sources with dust\nmasses significantly below predictions from simple chemical evolution models,\nand well below $M_d/M_*$ and $M_d/M_{gas}$ scaling relations seen in dust and\nstellar-selected samples of local galaxies. We use a chemical evolution model\nto explain these dust-poor, but gas-rich, sources as well as the observed star\nformation rates (SFRs) and dust-to-gas ratios. We find that (i) a delayed star\nformation history is required to model the observed SFRs; (ii) inflows and\noutflows are required to model the observed metallicities at low gas fractions;\n(iii) a reduced contribution of dust from supernovae (SNe) is needed to explain\nthe dust-poor sources with high gas fractions. These dust-poor, low stellar\nmass galaxies require a typical core-collapse SN to produce 0.01 - 0.16\n$M_{\\odot}$ of dust. To match the observed dust masses at lower gas fractions,\nsignificant grain growth is required to counteract the reduced contribution\nfrom dust in SNe and dust destruction from SN shocks. These findings are\nstatistically robust, though due to intrinsic scatter it is not always possible\nto find one single model that successfully describes all the data. We also show\nthat the dust-to-metals ratio decreases towards lower metallicity.\n", "  Electrons of dark current (DC), generated in high-gradient superconducting RF\ncavities (SRF) due to field emission, can be accelerated up to very high\nenergies-19 GeV in the case of the International Linear Collider (ILC) main\nlinac-before they are removed by focusing and steering magnets. Electromagnetic\nand hadron showers generated by such electrons can represent a significant\nradiation threat to the linac equipment and personnel. In our study, an\noperational scenario is analysed which is believed can be considered as the\nworst case scenario for the main linac regarding the DC contribution to the\nradiation environment in the main linac tunnel. A detailed modeling is\nperformed for the DC electrons which are emitted from the surface of the SRF\ncavities and can be repeatedly accelerated in the high-gradient fields in many\nSRF cavities. Results of MARS15 Monte Carlo calculations, performed for the\ncurrent main linac tunnel design, reveal that the prompt dose design level of\n25 {\\mu}Sv/hr in the service tunnel can be provided by a 2.3-m thick concrete\nwall between the main and service tunnels.\n", "  A comprehensive review of current analytical models, experimental techniques,\nand influencing factors is carried out to highlight the current challenges in\nthis area. The study of fluid-solid boundary conditions has been ongoing for\nmore than a century, starting from gas-solid interfaces and progressing to that\nof the more complex liquid-solid case. Breakthroughs have been made on the\ntheoretical and experimental fronts but the mechanism behind the phenomena\nremains a puzzle. This paper provides a review of the theoretical models, and\nnumerical and experimental investigations that have been carried out till date.\nProbable mechanisms and factors that affect the interfacial discontinuity are\nalso documented.\n", "  Some properties of defect modes of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLC) are\npresented. It is shown that when the CLC layer is thin the density of states\nand emission intensity are maximum for the defect mode, whereas when the CLC\nlayer is thick, these peaks are observed at the edges of the photonic band gap.\nSimilarly, when the gain is low, the density of states and emission intensity\nare maximum for the defect mode, whereas at high gains these peaks are also\nobserved at the edges of the photonic band gap. The possibilities of\nlow-threshold lasing and obtaining high-Q microcavities have been investigated.\n", "  We present the next step in a series of papers devoted to connecting the\ncomposition of the atmospheres of forming planets with the chemistry of their\nnatal evolving protoplanetary disks. The model presented here computes the\ncoupled chemical and dust evolution of the disk and the formation of three\nplanets per disk model. Our three canonical planet traps produce a Jupiter near\n1 AU, a Hot Jupiter and a Super-Earth. We study the dependency of the final\norbital radius, mass, and atmospheric chemistry of planets forming in disk\nmodels with initial disk masses that vary by 0.02 $M_\\odot$ above and below our\nfiducial model ($M_{disk,0} = 0.1 ~M_\\odot$). We compute C/O and C/N for the\natmospheres formed in our 3 models and find that C/O$_{\\rm planet}\\sim$\nC/O$_{\\rm disk}$, which does not vary strongly between different planets formed\nin our model. The nitrogen content of atmospheres can vary in planets that grow\nin different disk models. These differences are related to the formation\nhistory of the planet, the time and location that the planet accretes its\natmosphere, and are encoded in the bulk abundance of NH$_3$. These results\nsuggest that future observations of atmospheric NH$_3$ and an estimation of the\nplanetary C/O and C/N can inform the formation history of particular planetary\nsystems.\n", "  As the precursors to stellar clusters, it is imperative that we understand\nthe distribution and physical properties of dense molecular gas clouds and\nclumps. Such a study has been done with the ground-based Bolocam Galactic Plane\nSurvey (BGPS). Now the Herschel infrared GALactic plane survey (Hi-GAL) allows\nus to do the same with higher quality data and complete coverage of the\nGalactic plane. We have made a pilot study comparing dense molecular gas clumps\nidentified in the Hi-GAL and BGPS surveys, using six $2^\\circ \\times 2^\\circ$\nregions centered at Galactic longitudes of $\\ell = 11^\\circ$, 30$^\\circ$,\n41$^\\circ$, 50$^\\circ$, 202$^\\circ$, and $217^\\circ$. We adopted the BGPS\nmethodology for identifying clumps and estimating distances, leading to 6198\nclumps being identified in our substudy, with 995 of those having\nwell-constrained distances. These objects were evenly distributed with Galactic\nlongitude, a consequence of Hi-GAL being source confusion limited. These clumps\nrange in mass from 10$^{-2}$ M$_\\odot$ to 10$^{5}$ M$_\\odot$, and have\nheliocentric distances of up to 16 kpc. When clumps found in both surveys are\ncompared, we see that distances agree within 1 kpc and ratios of masses are of\norder unity. This serves as an external validation for BGPS and instills\nconfidence as we move forward to cataloging the clumps from the entirety of\nHi-GAL. In addition to the sources that were in common with BGPS, Hi-GAL found\nmany additional sources, primarily due to the lack of atmospheric noise. We\nexpect Hi-GAL to yield $2\\times10^5$ clumps, with 20% having well-constrained\ndistances, an order of magnitude above what was found in BGPS.\n", "  In practical combustion systems, the high nonlinearity of the turbulent\ncombustion process can result in unexpected behavior even for nominal operating\nconditions. This includes flame flashback in premixed gas turbines, engine\nunstart in scramjets, and failure of engines to ignite at high altitudes. Many\nof these events have catastrophic consequences. Hence, understanding the nature\nof such irregular excursions of combustion systems is important to ensure\nrobust operation. The focus of this work is to identify the sources of such\nrare excursions from a dynamical systems perspective. Specifically, such\nanomalous behavior can be explained in terms of three different classes based\non the trajectories that the system traverses in its phase-space. For each\nclass, computational algorithms and validation exercises are briefly discussed.\n", "  Based on Wheeler-DeWitt equation derived from general relativity, it had been\nfound that only dark energy can lead to a normalizable cosmological wave\nfunction. It is shown in the present work that, for dRGT gravity,\nEddington-inspired-Born-Infeld gravity and Ho$\\check{\\text{r}}$ava-Lifshitz\ngravity, the previous conclusion can also stand well in quantum cosmology\ninduced from these modified gravities. This observation implies that there\nmight be a universal relation between dark energy and normalizability of the\ncosmological wave function.\n", "  We present a novel type of three-dimensional dark focus optical trapping\npotential for ultra-cold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates. This 'optical\nbottle' is created with blue-detuned laser light exploiting the phenomenon of\nconical refraction occurring in biaxial crystals. We present experiments on\nconfining a Rb87 Bose-Einstein condensate in this potential and derive the\ntrapping frequencies and potential barriers under the harmonic approximation\nand the conical refraction theory.\n", "  Measurement Independence is an assumption used in foundational arguments\nsince the EPR thought experiment in 1935, and assumed in a majority of hidden\nvariable models of QM. In this thesis we review the crucial role of this\nassumption in several ontological theorems, develop new measurement dependent\nmodels having interesting properties, and a protocol for classical simulation\nof quantum channels using such a model. In particular, a maximally\npsi-epistemic model is given which is valid for any dimension of Hilbert\nspace(by violating preparation independence assumption).\n", "  The OPERA experiment reached its main goal by proving the appearance of\n$\\nu_{\\tau}$ in the CNGS $\\nu_{\\mu} $ beam. A sample of five $\\nu_{\\tau}$\ncandidates was collected allowing to reject the null hypothesis at $5.1\n\\sigma$. The estimation of $\\Delta m^2_{23}$ in \"appearance mode\" has been\nobtained. Updates on the search for $\\nu_{\\mu} \\to \\nu_e$ oscillations and on\nthe search for sterile neutrino mixing in the $\\nu_{\\mu} \\to \\nu_e$ and\n$\\nu_{\\mu} \\to \\nu_\\tau$ channels are also reported.\n", "  This article provides answers to the questions posed in the title. Contrary\nto the most common views, we show that neither the entropy, nor the Second Law\nmay be used for either living systems, or to life phenomenon.\n", "  Unprecedented bright and intense synchrotron X-rays have been widely used to\nunravel numerous compelling electronic and structural properties using a large\nvariety of physical techniques, while the puzzling phenomenon is the\nuncertainties of measurements due to X-ray induced considerable electronic and\nstructural changes of a matter under study. Here, we report an X-ray driven\nfirst-order tetrahedral-octahedral phase transition in GeO2 glass at high\npressure using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) with a\nnano-polycrystalline diamond anvil (NPD) cell. Upon X-ray irradiation from an\nundulator device, the XAFS spectrum at 5.4 GPa, which is below the threshold\npressure of tetrahedral to pentahedral transition, starts to progressively\napproach the spectrum of octahedral GeO2 at 20.4 GPa. Detailed analysis\nindicates that both the nearest distance and coordination number of GeO2 glass\nat 5.4 GPa increase to those of a fully octahedral glass above 20 GPa, while\nnegligible changes were found at other low pressures. These observations\ndemonstrate that X-ray irradiation can be served as an alternative stimulus for\nforming dense matter under pressure, as the well-known external stimuli of\npressure and temperature. Dense matter formed under external stimuli is crucial\nfor understanding the formation, differentiation and evolution of planet and\nEarth. Attention for the X-ray induced structural uncertainties is called,\nespecially for addressing metastable states under extreme conditions which may\nbecome undetectable in terms of intense synchrotron X-rays as structural tools.\n", "  Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenide materials emerged as a new\nmaterial class to study excitonic effects in solid state, since they benefit\nfrom enormous coulomb correlations between electrons and holes. Especially in\nWSe2, sharp emission features have been observed at cryogenic temperatures,\nwhich act as single photon sources . Tight exciton localization has been\nassumed to induce an anharmonic excitation spectrum, however, the evidence of\nthe hypothesis, namely the demonstration of a localized biexciton, is elusive.\nHere, we unambiguously demonstrate the existence of a localized biexciton in a\nmonolayer of WSe2, which triggers an emission cascade of single photons. The\nbiexciton is identified by its time-resolved photoluminescence, superlinearity\nand distinct polarization in micro-photoluminescence experiments. We evidence\nthe cascaded nature of the emission process in a cross-correlation experiment,\nwhich yields a strong bunching behavior. Our work paves the way to a new\ngeneration of quantum optics experiments with two-dimensional semiconductors.\n", "  We estimate the electron density, n_e, and its spatial variation in quiescent\nprominences from the observed emission ratio of the resonance lines Na I 5890\n(D2) and Sr II 4078. For a bright prominence (tau_alpha ~ 25) we obtain a mean\nn_e ~ 2*10^10 /cm^3; for a faint one (tau_alpha ~ 4) n_e ~ 4*10^10 /cm^3 on two\nconsecutive days with moderate internal fluctuation and no systematic variation\nwith height above the solar limb. The thermal and non-thermal contributions to\nthe line broadening, T_kin and V_nth, required to deduce n_e from the emission\nratio NaI/SrII cannot be unambiguously determined from observed widths of lines\nfrom atoms of different mass. The reduced widths, Delta-lambda_D / lambda_0, of\nSr II 4078 show an excess over those from NaD2 and H-delta, assuming the same\nT_kin and V_nth. We attribute this excess broadening to higher non-thermal\nbroadening induced by interaction of ions with the prominence magnetic field.\nThis is suggested by the finding of higher macro-shifts of SrII4078 as compared\nto those from NaD2.\n", "  In this paper we highlight peculiar features of the radiating Vaidya's metric\nbeing the result of algebraic deduction from the Einstein equations rather than\nof their proper integration. Thus, the standard \"first integral\" $f(m)$ proves\nto be not arbitrary but a constrained function, and the choice\n$f(m)=\\pm\\dot{m}$ sometimes used in literature does not satisfy the entire\nsystem of the Einstein equations. But still, the general Vaidya algorithm as a\nshortcut to catch underlying symmetries may be successfully applied, in\nparticular, to the problems of imbedding (e.g. Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime) or\nto the case of non-null (time-like or space-like) radial dust emission.\n", "  Si Li and author suggested in that, in some cases, the AdS/CFT correspondence\ncan be formulated in terms of the algebraic operation of Koszul duality. In\nthis paper this suggestion is checked explicitly for $M2$ branes in an\n$\\Omega$-background. The algebra of supersymmetric operators on a stack of $K$\n$M2$ branes is shown to be Koszul dual, in large $K$, to the algebra of\nsupersymmetric operators of $11$-dimensional supergravity in an\n$\\Omega$-background (using the formulation of supergravity in an\n$\\Omega$-background presented in arXiv:1610.04144).\n  The twisted form of supergravity that is used here can be quantized to all\norders in perturbation theory. We find that the Koszul duality result holds to\nall orders in perturbation theory, in both the gravitational theory and the\ntheory on the $M2$. (However, there is a certain non-linear identification of\nthe coupling constants on each side which I was unable to determine\nexplicitly).\n  It is also shown that the algebra of operators on $K$ $M2$ branes, as $K \\to\n\\infty$, is a quantum double-loop algebra (a two-variable analog of the\nYangian). This algebra is also the Koszul dual of the algebra of operators on\nthe gravitational theory. An explicit presentation for this algebra is\npresented, and it is shown that this algebra is the unique quantization of its\nclassical limit. Some conjectural applications to enumerative geometry of\nCalabi-Yau threefolds are also presented.\n", "  In the context of rough path theory (RPT), the theories of Hairer (2014) and\nGubinelli--Imkeller--Perkowski (2015) (GIP theory) gave new methods for\nconstruction of $\\Phi_{3}^{4}$ model. Roughly, their results state that a\nquantum field in a $\\Phi_{3}^{4}$ model can be smoothly approximated. Consider\nthe following question: Can RPT be applied to quantum Yang--Mills (YM) gauge\nfield theories to show that any YM theory can be smoothly approximated? In this\npaper we consider this problem in the simplest case of Euclidean YM theory,\ni.e. YM on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the usual Euclidean metric, as a test case. We\nprove that a (quantum) $SU(n)$ YM theory on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ in axial gauge can\nbe smoothly approximated for some class of Wilson loops.\n  While our study is inspired by the theories of Hairer and GIP, instead we use\nthe RPT framework of Friz--Victoir (2010) in proving the theorem.\n", "  It was experimentally demonstrated that short-period metamorphic\nInAs1-xSbx/InAs1-ySby superlattices with ultra low bandgap have properties of a\nDirac material. Cyclotron resonance and interband magneto-absorption peaks in\nsuperlattices with ultra-low bandgaps demonstrate a square root dependence on\nthe magnetic field for a range up to 16 T (energy range up to 300meV). This\ndirectly indicates the linearity of the electron dispersion. The Fermi velocity\ncan be controlled by varying the overlap between electron and hole states in\nthe superlattice. The dependence of the cyclotron resonance energy on the\nmagnetic field parallel to the superlattice plane demonstrates that the\nelectron dispersion in the growth direction can be characterized by an\neffective mass of 0.028m0 in a superlattice with a period of 6 nm and 0.045m0\nin a superlattice with a period of 7.5 nm. Extreme design flexibility makes the\nshort-period metamorphic InAs1-xSbx/InAs1-ySby superlattice a new prospective\nplatform for studying the effects of charge carrier chirality and topologically\nnontrivial states in structures with the inverted bandgaps.\n", "  Recovering the position of a source from the fluxes of diffusing particles\nthrough small receptors allows a biological cell to determine its relative\nposition, spatial localization and guide it to a final target. However, how a\nsource can be recovered from point fluxes remains unclear. Using the Narrow\nEscape Time approach for an open domain, we compute the diffusion fluxes of\nBrownian particles generated by a steady-state gradient from a single source\nthrough small holes distributed on a surface in two dimensions. {We find that\nthe location of a source can be recovered when there are at least 3 receptors\nand the source is positioned no further than 10 cell radii away}, but this\ncondition is not necessary in a narrow strip. The present approach provides a\ncomputational basis for the first step of direction sensing of a gradient at a\nsingle cell level.\n", "  We investigate the heterogeneous dynamics in a model, where chemical gelation\nand glass transition interplay, focusing on the dynamical susceptibility. Two\nindependent mechanisms give raise to the correlations, which are manifested in\nthe dynamical susceptibility: one is related to the presence of permanent\nclusters, while the other is due to the increase of particle crowding as the\nglass transition is approached. The superposition of these two mechanisms\noriginates a variety of different behaviours. We show that these two mechanisms\ncan be unentangled considering the wave vector dependence of the dynamical\nsusceptibility.\n", "  A fluid-structure interaction problem with the melting of water around a\nheated horizontal circular cylinder is analysed with numerical simulations.\nDynamic meshing was used for evolving the flow domain in time as the melting\nfront extended radially outward from the cylinder; a node shuffle algorithm was\nused to retain mesh quality across the significant mesh deformation. We\nsimulated one case above the density inversion point of water and one case\nbelow, yielding pear-shaped melting fronts due to thermal plumes either rising\nor falling from the cylinder, respectively. Results were compared with previous\nexperimental studies and the melting front profiles matched reasonably well and\nmelting rates were in agreement. We confirm that natural convection plays a\nsignificant role in the transport of energy as the melt zone increases, and\nneeds to be considered for accurately modelling phase change under these\nconditions.\n", "  The magnetic fields in the solar corona are generally neither force-free nor\naxisymmetric and have complex dynamics that are difficult to characterize. Here\nwe simulate the topological evolution of solar coronal magnetic field lines\n(MFLs) using a magnetohydrodynamic model. The simulation is initialized with a\nnon-axisymmetric non-force-free magnetic field that best correlates with the\nobserved vector magnetograms of solar active regions (ARs). To focus on these\nideas, simulations are performed for the flaring AR 11283 noted for its\ncomplexity and well-documented dynamics. The simulated dynamics develops as the\ninitial Lorentz force pushes the plasma and facilitates successive magnetic\nreconnections at the two X-type null lines present in the initial field.\nImportantly, the simulation allows for the spontaneous development of mass\nflow, unique among contemporary works, that preferentially reconnects field\nlines at one of the X-type null lines. Consequently, a flux rope consisting of\nlow-lying twisted MFLs, which approximately traces the major polarity inversion\nline, undergoes an asymmetric monotonic rise. The rise is attributed to a\nreduction in the magnetic tension force at the region overlying the rope,\nresulting from the reconnection. A monotonic rise of the rope is in conformity\nwith the standard scenario of flares. Importantly, the simulated dynamics leads\nto bifurcations of the flux rope, which, being akin to the observed filament\nbifurcation in AR 11283, establishes the appropriateness of the initial field\nin describing ARs.\n", "  We demonstrate temporal measurements of subpicosecond optical pulses via\ntime-to-frequency conversion in a 45cm long CMOS compatible high index glass\nspiral waveguide. The measurements are based on efficient four wave mixing in\nthe C-band, using around 1W of peak pump power. We achieve a resolution of\n400fs over a time window of 100ps, representing a time-bandwidth product > 250.\n", "  Prosocial punishment has been proved to be a powerful mean to promote\ncooperation. Recent studies have found that social exclusion, which indeed can\nbe regarded as a kind of punishment, can also support cooperation. However, if\nprosocial punishment and exclusion are both present, it is still unclear which\nstrategy is more advantageous to curb free-riders. Here we first study the\ndirect competition between different types of punishment and exclusion. We find\nthat pool (peer) exclusion can always outperform pool (peer) punishment both in\nthe optional and in the compulsory public goods game, no matter whether\nsecond-order sanctioning is considered or not. Furthermore, peer exclusion does\nbetter than pool exclusion both in the optional and in the compulsory game, but\nthe situation is reversed in the presence of second-order exclusion. Finally,\nwe extend the competition among all possible sanctioning strategies and find\nthat peer exclusion can outperform all other strategies in the absence of\nsecond-order exclusion and punishment, while pool exclusion prevails when\nsecond-order sanctioning is possible. Our results demonstrate that exclusion is\na more powerful strategy than punishment for the resolution of social dilemmas.\n", "  We consider two body relaxation in a spherical system with a loss cone.\nConsidering two-dimensional angular momentum space, we focus on \"empty loss\ncone\" systems, where the typical scattering during a dynamical time $j_{d}$ is\nsmaller than the size of the loss cone $j_{\\rm lc}$. As a result, the\noccupation number within the loss cone is significantly smaller than outside.\nClassical diffusive treatment of this regime predict exponentially small\noccupation number deep in the loss cone. We revisit this classical derivation\nof occupancy distribution of objects in the empty loss cone regime. We\nemphasize the role of the rare large scatterings and show that the occupancy\ndoes not decay exponentially within the loss cone, but it is rather flat, with\na typical value $\\sim [(j_d/j_{\\rm lc})]^2\\ln^{-2}(j_{\\rm lc}/j_{\\min})$\ncompared to the occupation in circular angular momentum (where $j_{\\min}$ is\nthe smallest possible scattering). Implication are that although the loss cone\nfor tidal break of Giants or binaries is typically empty, tidal events which\noccurs significantly inside the loss cone ($\\beta\\gtrsim 2$), are almost as\ncommon as those with $\\beta\\cong 1$ where $\\beta$ is the ratio between the\ntidal radius and the periastron. The probability for event with penetration\nfactor $>\\beta$ decreases only as $\\beta^{-1}$ rather than exponentially. This\neffect has no influence on events characterized by full loss cone, such as\ntidal disruption event of $\\sim 1m_\\odot$ main sequence star.\n", "  Consider the problem: Alice wishes to send the same key to $n-1$ users (Bob,\nCarol,. . . , Nathan), while preventing eavesdropper Eve from acquiring\ninformation without being detected. The problem has no solution in the\nclassical cryptography but in quantum telecommunication there are some codes to\nsolve the problem. In the paper \\cite{zengetall}, Guo-Jyun Zeng, Kuan-Hung\nChen, Zhe-Hua Chang, Yu-Shan Yang, and Yao-Hsin Chou from one side and Cabello\nin \\cite{cabello} from other side, used Hadamard gates, Pauli gates in\nproviding the quantum communication code for two-partity telecommunication with\n3 persons and then generalized it to the case of arbitrary number of\nparticipants, indicating the position of measurements of participants. We\nremark that the Hadamard gate with precising the position of measurement is the\nsame as Fourier transform for two qubits and hence use the general Fourier\ntransform for $n$ entangled qubits, in place of Hadamard gates. The result is\nmore natural for arbitrary $n$ qudits.\n", "  Advanced chain-growth computer simulation methodologies have been employed\nfor a systematic statistical analysis of the critical behavior of a polymer\nadsorbing at a substrate. We use finitesize scaling techniques to investigate\nthe solvent-quality dependence of critical exponents, critical temperature, and\nthe structure of the phase diagram. Our study covers all solvent effects from\nthe limit of super-self-avoiding walks, characterized by effective\nmonomer-monomer repulsion, to poor solvent conditions that enable the formation\nof compact polymer structures. The results significantly benefit from taking\ninto account corrections to scaling.\n", "  One of the primary goals of the STAR spin program is to determine the\ncontribution of the gluon spin ($\\Delta G$) to that of the proton. Recent\nmeasurements of the longitudinal double-helicity asymmetry, $A_{LL}$, from\ninclusive jets place strong constraints on the spin-dependent gluon\ndistribution $\\Delta g(x)$ and, for the first time, find evidence for non-zero\ngluon polarization values for partonic momentum fraction $x$ greater than 0.05.\nIn contrast to inclusive jets, di-jet correlation measurements provide access\nto partonic kinematics, at leading order, and thus give tighter constraints on\nthe behavior of $\\Delta g$ as a function of gluon momentum fraction.\nFurthermore, di-jet measurements at forward rapidity probe the lower $x$ values\nwhere $\\Delta g(x)$ is poorly constrained. Preliminary $A_{LL}$ results for\ndi-jets with $-0.8 < \\eta_1 < 0.8$ and $0.8 < \\eta_2 < 1.8$, from polarized\n$pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV, are presented.\n", "  For the prototypical diatomic-molecule - diatomic molecule interactions H2-HX\nand H2-X2, where X = F, Cl, Br, quantum-chemical ab initio calculations are\ncarried out on grids of the configuration space, which permit a\nspherical-harmonics representation of the potential energy surfaces (PESs).\nDimer geometries are considered for sets of representative leading\nconfigurations, and the PESs are analyzed in terms of isotropic and anisotropic\ncontributions. The leading configurations are individuated by selecting a\nminimal set of mutual orientations of molecules needed to build the\nspherical-harmonic expansion on geometrical and symmetry grounds. The terms of\nthe PESs corresponding to repulsive and bonding dimer geometries and the\naveraged isotropic term, for each pair of interacting molecules, are compared\nwith representations in terms of a potential function proposed by Pirani et al.\n(see Chem. Phys. Lett. 2004, 394, 37-44 and references therein). Connections of\nthe involved parameters with molecular properties provide insight into the\nnature of the interactions.\n", "  Nano--metal/semiconductor junction dependent porosification of silicon (Si)\nhas been studied here. The silicon (Si) nanostructures (NS) have been textured\non n-- and p-- type silicon wafers using Ag and Au metal nano particles induced\nchemical etching. The combinations of n--Si/Ag and p--Si/Au form ohmic contact\nand result in the same texturization on the Si surface on porosification where\ntent--shaped morphology has been observed consistently with n-- and p--type Si.\nWhereas, porosification result in different surface texturization for other two\ncombinations (p--Si/Ag and n--Si/Au) where Schottkey contacts are formed.\nQuantitative analysis have been done using ImageJ to process the SEM images of\nSiNS, which confirms that the tent like SiNS are formed when etching of silicon\nwafer is done by AgNPs and AuNPs on n and p type Si wafer respectively. These\neasily prepared sharp tent--shaped Si NSs can be used for enhanced field\nemission applications.\n", "  We present data on the gas phase abundances for 9 different elements in the\ninterstellar medium of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), based on the strengths\nof ultraviolet absorption features over relevant velocities in the spectra of\n18 stars within the SMC. From this information and the total abundances defined\nby the element fractions in young stars in the SMC, we construct a general\ninterpretation on how these elements condense into solid form onto dust grains.\nAs a group, the elements Si, S, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn exhibit depletion sequences\nsimilar to those in the local part of our Galaxy defined by Jenkins (2009). The\nelements Mg and Ti deplete less rapidly in the SMC than in the Milky Way, and\nMn depletes more rapidly. We speculate that these differences might be\nexplained by the different chemical affinities to different existing grain\nsubstrates. For instance, there is evidence that the mass fractions of\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the SMC are significantly lower than\nthose in the Milky Way. We propose that the depletion sequences that we\nobserved for the SMC may provide a better model for interpreting the element\nabundances in low metallicity Damped Lyman Alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA absorption\nsystems that are recorded in the spectra of distant quasars and gamma ray burst\nafterglows.\n", "  We demonstrated a 2D helical chiral metamaterial that exhibits broadband\nstrong optical activity resulting nonresonant Drude-like response. The strong\nchirality leads to broadband negative refractive index with high figure of\nmerit (>90) and extremely low loss (<2% per layer). The optical activity are\ninsensitive to the angles of incident electromagnetic waves, thereby enabling\nmore flexibility in polarization manipulation applicaitons.\n", "  We demonstrate that the metamaterial perfect absorber behaves as a\nmeta-cavity bounded between a resonant metasurface and a metallic thin-film\nreflector. The perfect absorption is achieved by the Fabry-Perot cavity\nresonance via multiple reflections between the \"quasi-open\" boundary of\nresonator and the \"closed\" boundary of reflector. The characteristic features\nincluding angle independence, ultra-thin thickness and strong field\nlocalization can be well explained by this model. With this model, metamaterial\nperfect absorber can be redefined as a meta-cavity exhibiting high Q-factor,\nstrong field enhancement and extremely high photonic density of states, thereby\npromising novel applications for high performance sensor, infrared\nphotodetector and cavity quantum electrodynamics devices.\n", "  We consider light propagation through a twisted nematic liquid crystal. At\nfirst, an expression for light transmission is obtained using a rather\nintuitive approach. Secondly, an accurate solution for light transmission based\non Maxwell's equations is derived and compared with the previous one. Both\napproaches show that when changes in the orientation of the liquid crystal\noptical axis are small on the scale defined by the optical wavelength (Mauguin\nlimit), the polarization of light approximately follows the optical axis. At\nthe same time, even in this limit, the simple formula for the light\ntransmittance mentioned in some monographs on liquid crystal displays is not\nnecessary accurate. Conditions under which the two approaches give the same\nexpression for the light transmission are found. In addition, two numerical\nmethods for finding the light transmittance are considered. It is demonstrated\nthat the Gauss-Seidel method has much faster convergence rate than the Euler\nmethod.\n", "  Rare decays of heavy-flavoured particles provide an ideal laboratory to look\nfor deviations from the Standard Model, and explore energy regimes beyond the\nLHC reach. Decays proceeding via electroweak penguin diagrams are excellent\nprobes to search for New Physics, and $b \\to s \\ell^{+}\\ell^{-}$ processes are\nparticularly interesting since they give access to many observables such as\nbranching fractions, asymmetries and angular observables. Recent results from\nthe LHCb experiment are reviewed.\n", "  We construct the molecular model and the tensor model for the dynamics of the\nnematic phases of bent-core molecules and star molecules in incompressible\nfluid. We start from the molecular interaction and the molecule--fluid\nfriction, and write down a general formulation based on the molecular shape and\nthe free energy. Then we incorporate an Onsager-theory-based static tensor\nmodel that is determined by the molecular shape. In this way, the terms in the\nmolecular model are fully determined by the molecular shape and expressed by\nphysical parameters. For bent-core molecules and star molecules, the model\nshares the same form, but is different in the coefficients. With the polar\ninteraction and elastic energy taken into account, and the convection and\ndiffusion included both spatially and orientationally, the model is suitable\nfor inhomogeneous flows. We adopt the quasi-equilibrium approximation to derive\nthe tensor model with energy dissipation maintained. Numerical simulation is\ncarried out focusing on the shear flow problem using both the molecular and the\ntensor models. We choose the parameters near the transition region of different\nequilibrium nematic phases and examine the effect of molecular shape on the\nflow modes. The tensor model proves to exhibit all the flow modes found in the\nmolecular model.\n", "  We demonstrate that the approximation for the number of inflationary e-folds\ncommonly used in the literature can lead to highly inaccurate predictions for\nthe amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. We show that such an\napproximation can lead to perfectly viable inflation models being falsely ruled\nout by direct or indirect gravitational-wave measurements. We illustrate this\npoint using a new class of inflation models which include the power-law\npotential as the simplest limit. These models are simple to construct without\nusing the slow-roll approximation, and are consistent with constraints from\nPlanck. Crucially, these models may suffer from an order-of-magnitude error in\nthe prediction for the gravitational-wave amplitude if the common definition of\ne-folding is used. Our findings have strong implications for the classes of\ninflation models that can be ruled out by future space-based laser\ninterferometers such as BBO and DECIGO.\n", "  A quantum communication network can be constructed by distributing a\nmultipartite entangled state to space-separated nodes. Entangled optical beams\nwith highest flying speed and measurable brightness can be used as carriers to\nconvey information in quantum communication networks. Losses and noises\nexisting in real communication channels will reduce or even totally destroy\nentanglement. The phenomenon of disentanglement will result in the complete\nfailure of quantum communication. Here, we present the experimental\ndemonstrations on the disentanglement and the entanglement revival of\ntripartite entangled optical beams used in a quantum network. We discover that\nsymmetric tripartite entangled optical beams are robust in pure lossy but\nnoiseless channels. While in a noisy channel the excess noise will lead to the\ndisentanglement and the destroyed entanglement can be revived by the use of a\ncorrelated noisy channel (non-Markovian environment). The presented results\nprovide useful technical references for establishing quantum networks.\n", "  We analyse nonlinear evolution of torsional Alfv\\'en waves in a straight\nmagnetic flux tube filled in with a low-$\\beta$ plasma, and surrounded with a\nplasma of lower density. Such magnetic tubes model, in particular, a segment of\na coronal loop or a polar plume. The wavelength is taken comparable to the tube\nradius. We perform numerical simulation of the wave propagation using ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics. We find that a torsional wave nonlinearly induces three\nkinds of compressive flows: the parallel flow at the Alfv\\'en speed, that\nconstitutes a bulk plasma motion along the magnetic field, the tube wave, and\nalso transverse flows in the radial direction, associated with sausage fast\nmagnetoacoustic modes. In addition, nonlinear torsional wave steepens and its\npropagation speed increases. The latter effect leads to the progressive\ndistortion of torsional wave front, i.e. nonlinear phase mixing. Because of the\nintrinsic non-uniformity of the torsional wave amplitude across the tube\nradius, the nonlinear effects are more pronounced in regions with higher wave\namplitude. They are always absent at the axes of the flux tube. In the case of\na linear radial profile of the wave amplitude, the nonlinear effects are\nlocalised in an annulus region near the tube boundary. Thus, the parallel\ncompressive flows driven by torsional Alfv\\'en waves in the solar and stellar\ncoronae, are essentially non-uniform in the perpendicular direction. The\npresence of additional sinks for the wave energy reduces the efficiency of the\nnonlinear parallel cascade in torsional Alfv\\'en waves.\n", "  Line-doubled Fresnel zone plates provide nanoscale, high aspect ratio\nstructures required for efficient high resolution imaging in the multi-keV\nx-ray range. For the fabrication of such optics a high aspect ratio HSQ resist\ntemplate is produced by electron-beam lithography and then covered with Ir by\natomic layer deposition (ALD).\n", "  The dynamics of non-autonomous bright matter-wave solitons in Rabi coupled\nbinary Bose-Einstein condensates is explored. By performing a unitary and\nsimilarity/lens-type transformation, we reduce the non-autonomous\nGross-Pitaevskii equation into the celebrated Manakov model. Then, we construct\nthe exact bright solitons of the non-autonomous Gross-Pitaevskii system in the\npresence of time dependent nonlinearities for two specific forms, namely\nhyperbolic nonlinearities, which are of physical interest. The experimental\npossibilities of realizing the forms of temporally modulated potentials\ncorresponding to these time dependent nonlinearities and supporting such\nlocalized structures are explored. Our study on the propagation of one soliton\nshows that the amplitude, velocity and shape of the bright soliton are altered\nby the time-dependent scattering length. We also analyse the non-trivial energy\nsharing collision of Manakov solitons in the presence of Rabi coupling and\naforementioned nonlinearities. We find that breathers arise in two-soliton\ncollisions and the nature of energy sharing collisions is altered from that of\nManakov system due to Rabi coupling only. Further in the presence of\ntime-dependent nonlinearities the collision scenario is again altered\nsignificantly. Finally, the stability of these localized structures is examined\nusing a recently developed powerful analytic method by Quintero et. al., [Phys.\nRev. E 91, 012905 (2015)] and it is shown that the non- autonomous bright\nsolitons are indeed stable. The evolution of position and velocity is also\nstudied.\n", "  Chemiluminescence in 1,2-dioxetane occurs through a thermally activated\ndecomposition reaction into two formaldehyde molecules. Both ground-state and\nnonadiabatic dynamics (including singlet excited states) of the decomposition\nreaction have been simulated, starting from the first O-O bond-breaking\ntransition structure. The ground-state dissociation occurs between t = 30 fs\nand t = 140 fs. The so-called entropic trap leads to frustrated dissociations,\npostponing the decomposition reaction. Specific geometrical conditions are\nnecessary for the trajectories to escape from the entropic trap and for\ndissociation to be possible. The singlet excited states participate as well in\nthe trapping of the molecule: dissociation including the nonadiabatic\ntransitions to singlet excited states now occurs from t = 30 fs to t = 250 fs\nand later. Specific regions of the seam of the S0/S1 conical intersections that\nwould \"retain\" the molecule for longer on the excited state have been\nidentified.\n", "  Keeping current interests to identify materials with intrinsic\nmagnetodielectric behavior near room temperature and with novel pyroelectric\ncurrent anomalies, we report temperature and magnetic-field dependent behavior\nof complex dielectric permittivity and pyroelectric current for an oxide,\nLi2Ni2Mo3O12, containing magnetic ions with (distorted) honey-comb and chain\narrangement and ordering magnetically below 8 K. The dielectric data reveal the\nexistence of relaxor ferroelectricity behavior in the range 160-240 K and there\nare corresponding Raman mode anomalies as well in that temperature range.\nPyrocurrent behavior is also consistent with this interpretation, with the\npyrocurrent peak-temperature interestingly correlating with the poling\ntemperature. 7Li NMR offer an evidence for crystallographic disorder intrinsic\nto this compound and we therefore conclude that such a disorder is apparently\nresponsible for the randomness of local electric field leading to relaxor\nferroelectric property. Another observation of emphasis is that there is a\nnotable decrease in the dielectric constant with the application of magnetic\nfield to the tune of about -2.4% at 300 K, with the magnitude varying\nmariginally with temperature. Small loss factor values validate intrinsic\nbehavior of the magnetodielectric effect at room temperature.\n", "  We have developed a recently proposed Josephson traveling-wave parametric\namplifier with three-wave mixing [A. B. Zorin, Phys. Rev. Applied 6, 034006,\n2016]. The amplifier consists of a microwave transmission line formed by a\nserial array of nonhysteretic one-junction SQUIDs. These SQUIDs are flux-biased\nin a way that the phase drops across the Josephson junctions are equal to 90\ndegrees and the persistent currents in the SQUID loops are equal to the\nJosephson critical current values. Such a one-dimensional metamaterial\npossesses a maximal quadratic nonlinearity and zero cubic (Kerr) nonlinearity.\nThis property allows phase matching and exponential power gain of traveling\nmicrowaves to take place over a wide frequency range. We report the\nproof-of-principle experiment performed at a temperature of T = 4.2 K on Nb\ntrilayer samples, which has demonstrated that our concept of a practical\nbroadband Josephson parametric amplifier is valid and very promising for\nachieving quantum-limited operation.\n", "  The demands on optical components to tolerate high radiation dose and\nmanipulate hard x-ray beams that can fit the experiment requirements, are\nconstantly increasing due to the advancements in the available x-ray sources.\nHere we have successfully fabricated the transmission type gratings using\ndiamond, with structure sizes ranging from few tens of nanometres up to\nmicrometres, and aspect ratio of up to 20. The efficiencies of the gratings\nwere measured over a wide range of photon energies and their radiation\ntolerance was confirmed using the most intense x-ray source in the world. The\nfidelity of these grating structures was confirmed by the quality of the\nmeasured experimental results.\n", "  We report the results of neutron diffraction, ac and dc magnetization,\nheat-capacity, complex permittivity, and pyrocurrent measurements on an oxide,\nLi3NiRuO5, hitherto not paid much attention in the literature, except for a\nprevious report on its promising electrochemical performance. We emphasize on\nthe following findings: (i) Observation of re-entrant spin-glass behavior; that\nis, this oxide undergoes ferrilmagnetic ordering below 8- K, entering\nspin-glass regime around 12 K. (ii) There is no prominent feature in the\ncomplex dielectric permittivity (in particular, at the magnetic transitions) in\nthe absence of external magnetic field, indicative of the absence of\nferroelectricity. However, there is a distinct evidence for magneto-dielectric\n(MDE) coupling. The sign of MDE coupling also changes as the sample is cooled\nfrom ferrimagnetic state to spin-glass regime. (iii) There are pyroelectric\nanomalies in the vicinity of 30-70 K, presumably from thermally stimulated\ndepolarization current.\n", "  We study the diffusive transport of magnons through the compensated\nferrimagnetic insulator Gd3Fe5O12 (GdIG). The magnons are injected and detected\nelectrically in a non-local measurement configuration via two parallel Pt\nstrips deposited on top of the ferrimagnet. GdIG exhibits a rich magnon\nspectrum, with several thermally populated magnon bands at room temperature. We\nobserve a strong temperature and field dependence of the non-local voltage in\nthe detector strip. Just below the magnetization compensation temperature we\nfind that the increasing magnetic field causes an unexpected enhancement of the\nnon-local signal. A comparison with GdIG spin wave spectra obtained from\natomistic modeling indicates that the thermal magnon population is important\nfor understanding the non-local voltage signal.\n", "  The turbulent boundary layer scaling parameters for the velocity profile are\nusually associated with either the inner viscous region or the outer boundary\nlayer region. It has been a long-held view that complete similarity of the\nvelocity profile can only occur if the inner and outer region scaling\nparameters change proportionally as one moves from station to station along the\nwall. However, it appears that complete similarity is not possible for the\nwall-bounded turbulent boundary layer. Hence, the outer/inner ratio would seem\nto be of little use. However, recent revelations revive the need for\nidentifying likely experimental datasets that display outer region similarity.\nIt is our contention that likely datasets can be identified by finding datasets\nin which the inner-outer thickness ratio is almost constant. This inner-outer\nthickness ratio is usually associated with the Rotta scaling ratio.\nUnfortunately, the Rotta ratio proportional change condition has never been\nshown to be a similarity requirement. In contrast, we show that a recently\ndeveloped thickness ratio based on the integral moment method must change\nproportionately from station to station if similarity is present.\n", "  A systematic review is made for the AA-, AB- and ABC-stacked graphites. The\ngeneralized tight-binding model, accompanied with the effective-mass\napproximation and the Kubo formula, is developed to investigate electronic and\noptical properties in the presence/absence of a uniform magnetic field. The\nunusual electronic properties cover the stacking-dependent Dirac-cone\nstructures, the significant energy widths along the stacking direction, the\nLandau subbands (LSs) crossing the Fermi level, the $B_0$-dependent LS energy\nspectra with crossings and anti-crossings, and the monolayer- or bilayer-like\nLandau wavefunctions. There exist the configuration-created special structures\nin density of states and optical spectra. Three kinds of graphites quite differ\nfrom one another in the available inter-LS excitation channels, including the\nnumber, frequency, intensity and structures of absorption peaks. The\ndimensional crossover presents the main similarities and differences between\ngraphites and graphenes; furthermore, the quantum confinement enriches the\nmagnetic quantization phenomena in carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons.\nThe cooperative/competitive relations among the interlayer atomic interactions,\ndimensions and magnetic quantization are responsible for the diversified\nessential properties. Part of theoretical predictions are consistent with the\nexperimental measurements.\n", "  We present 15 GHz stacked VLBA images of 373 jets associated with active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) having at least five observing epochs within a 20 yr time\ninterval 1994-2015 from the MOJAVE programme and/or its precursor, the 2 cm\nVLBA Survey. These data are supplemented by 1.4 GHz single-epoch VLBA\nobservations of 135 MOJAVE AGNs to probe larger scale jet structures. The\ntypical jet geometry is found to be close to conical on scales from hundreds to\nthousands of parsecs, while a number of galaxies show quasi-parabolic\nstreamlines on smaller scales. A true jet geometry in a considerable fraction\nof AGNs appears only after stacking epochs over several years. The jets with\nsignificant radial accelerated motion undergo more active collimation. We have\nanalysed total intensity jet profiles transverse to the local jet ridgeline and\nderived both apparent and intrinsic opening angles of the flows, with medians\nof $21.5\\deg$ and $1.3\\deg$, respectively. The Fermi LAT-detected gamma-ray\nAGNs in our sample have, on average, wider apparent and narrower intrinsic\nopening angle, and smaller viewing angle than non LAT-detected AGNs. We have\nestablished a highly significant correlation between the apparent opening angle\nand gamma-ray luminosity, driven by Doppler beaming and projection effects.\n", "  Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods have revolutionised mathematical computation\nand enabled statistical inference within many previously intractable models. In\nthis context, Hamiltonian dynamics have been proposed as an efficient way of\nbuilding chains which can explore probability densities efficiently. The method\nemerges from physics and geometry and these links have been extensively studied\nby a series of authors through the last thirty years. However, there is\ncurrently a gap between the intuitions and knowledge of users of the\nmethodology and our deep understanding of these theoretical foundations. The\naim of this review is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the geometric\ntools used in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo at a level accessible to statisticians,\nmachine learners and other users of the methodology with only a basic\nunderstanding of Monte Carlo methods. This will be complemented with some\ndiscussion of the most recent advances in the field which we believe will\nbecome increasingly relevant to applied scientists.\n", "  Nonlinear effects of the trapping of resonant particles by the combined\naction of the electric field and the magnetic mirror force is studied using a\ngyrokinetic description that includes the finite Larmor radius effects. A\ngeneral nonlinear solution is found that is supported by the nonlinearity\narising from the resonant particles, trapped by the combined action of the\nparallel electric field and the magnetic mirror force. Applying these results\nto the space plasma conditions, we demonstrate that in the magnetosheath\nplasma, coherent nonlinear magnetic depression may be created associated with\nthe nonlinear mirror mode and supported by the population of trapped ions\nforming a hump in the distribution function. These objects may appear either\nisolated or as the train of weakly correlated structures (the cnoidal wave). In\nthe Solar wind and in the Earths magnetopause, characterized with anisotropic\nelectron and ion temperatures that are of the same order of magnitude, we find\ncoherent magnetic holes of the same form that are attributed to the two\nbranches of the nonlinear magnetosonic mode, the electron mirror and the field\nswelling mode, including also the kinetic Alfven mode, and supported by the\npopulation of trapped electrons. The localized magnetic holes may have the form\nof a moving oblique slab or of an ellipsoid parallel to the magnetic field and\nstrongly elongated along it, that propagates along the magnetic field and may\nbe convected in the perpendicular direction by a plasma flow. While the ion\nmirror structures are purely compressional magnetic, featuring negligible\nmagnetic torsion and electric field, the magnetosonic and kinetic Alfven\nstructures possess a finite electrostatic potential, magnetic compression, and\nmagnetic torsion, but the ratio of the perpendicular and parallel magnetic\nfields remains small.\n", "  With purely classical tools a model for a bouncer-walker system of an\nelementary particle will be derived in this work which reflects the old idea of\nde Broglie's particle-wave duality. This model contains, on the one hand, a\npossible explanation of the work-energy exchange between the two separated\nmotions, thereby providing an energy quantisation as originally postulated by\nMax Planck. On the other hand, the system perfectly obeys the Bohmian-type law\nof motion in full accordance with quantum mechanics.\n  For the calculation of elementary particles' trajectories a ballistic\ndiffusion equation will be derived which is a special case of a diffusion\nequation with a time-dependent diffusivity. Therewith the simulation of\nspreading of an elementary Gaussian is made easy as will be shown herein.\n  With these tools one also accounts for Born's rule for multi-slit systems and\ndevelops a set of current rules that directly leads to a new formulation of the\nguiding equation equivalent to the original one of the de Broglie-Bohm theory.\nAs will be shown in this thesis, this tool reproduces Talbot patterns and\nTalbot distance for an arbitrary multi-slit system.\n  Moreover, the sweeper effect is shown to arise when the intensity relation of\ntwo beams of a double-slit experiment exhibit a big difference. Then, the\nlow-intensity beam is pushed aside in a sense that its initial propagation\nstraight out of the slit is bent towards the side. A sideways screen as an\nalternative measurement method is proposed.\n", "  This technical note describes the application of the Valencia RPA\nmulti-nucleon effect and its uncertainty to QE reactions from the GENIE\nneutrino event generator. The analysis of MINERvA neutrino data in Rodrigues et\nal. PRL 116 071802 (2016) paper makes clear the need for an RPA suppression,\nespecially at very low momentum and energy transfer. That published analysis\ndoes not constrain the magnitude of the effect; it only tests models with and\nwithout the effect against the data. Other MINERvA analyses need an expression\nof the model uncertainty in the RPA effect. A well-described uncertainty can be\nused for systematics for unfolding, for model errors in the analysis of non-QE\nsamples, and as input for fitting exercises for model testing or constraining\nbackgrounds. This prescription takes uncertainties on the parameters in the\nValencia RPA model and adds a (not-as-tight) constraint from muon capture data.\nFor MINERvA we apply it as a 2D ($q_0$,$q_3$) weight to GENIE events, in lieu\nof generating a full beyond-Fermi-gas quasielastic events. Because it is a\nweight, it can be applied to the generated and fully Geant4 simulated events\nused in analysis without a special GENIE sample. For some limited uses, it\ncould be cast as a 1D $Q^2$ weight without much trouble. This procedure is a\nsuitable starting point for NOvA and DUNE where the energy dependence is\nmodest, but probably not adequate for T2K or MicroBooNE.\n", "  Single layers of WS2 are direct gap semiconductors with high\nphotoluminescence (PL) yield holding great promise for emerging applications in\noptoelectronics. The spatial confinement in a 2D monolayer together with the\nweak dielectric screening lead to huge binding energies for the neutral\nexcitons as well as other excitonic complexes, such as trions and biexcitons\nwhose binding energies scale accordingly. Here, we report on the existence of\nbiexcitons in mechanically exfoliated WS2 flakes from 78 K up to room\ntemperature. Performing temperature and power dependent PL measurements, we\nidentify the biexciton emission channel through the superlinear behavior of the\nintegrated PL intensity as a function of the excitation power density. On the\ncontrary, neutral and charged excitons show a linear to sublinear dependence in\nthe whole temperature range. From the energy difference between the emission\nchannels of the biexciton and neutral exciton, a biexciton binding energy of\n65-70 meV is determined.\n", "  We endeavor to assess site response exploiting ambient noise measurements\nwhich we carried out at 70 sites in different parts of Shillong City, one of\nthe seismically active regions. We estimate the spectral ratio from these\nrecordings. The spectral ratios reveal the resonant frequency for Shillong City\nin the range of 3 to 8 Hz. Short scale spatial variation in the resonant\nfrequencies suggests that there is prominent lateral heterogeneity in the\nunderlying layers. Besides, a non-linear earthquake site response analysis is\nalso attempted using available geotechnical data. A good correlation is\nobserved between site response analysis and HVSR results constrained by wide\nvariation of resonant frequency at short distances. The results are found to be\ntallying well with the geological data.\n", "  Various frameworks have been proposed to predict mechanical system responses\nby combining data from different fidelities for design optimization and\nuncertainty quantification as reviewed by Fern\\'andez-Godino et al. and\nPeherstorfer et al.. Among all frameworks, the Bayesian framework based on\nGaussian processes has the potential of highest accuracy. However, the Bayesian\nframework requires optimization for estimating hyper-parameters, and there is a\nrisk of estimating inappropriate hyper-parameters as Kriging surrogate often\ndoes, especially in the presence of noisy data. We propose an easy and yet\npowerful framework for practical design and applications. In this technical\nnote, we revised a heuristic framework which minimizes the prediction errors at\nhigh-fidelity samples using optimization. The system behavior (high-fidelity\nbehavior) is approximated by a linear combination of the low-fidelity\npredictions and a polynomial-based discrepancy function. The key idea is to\nconsider the low-fidelity model as a basis function in the multi-fidelity model\nwith the scale factor as a regression coefficient. The design matrix for\nleast-square estimation consists of both the low-fidelity model and discrepancy\nfunction. Then the scale factor and coefficients of the basis functions are\nobtained simultaneously using linear regression, which guarantees the\nuniqueness of fitting process. Besides enabling efficient estimation of the\nparameters, the proposed least-squares multi-fidelity surrogate (LS-MFS) can be\napplicable to other regression models by simply replacing the design matrix.\nTherefore, the LS-MFS is expected to be easily applied to various applications\nsuch as prediction variance, D-optimal designs, uncertainty propagation and\ndesign optimization.\n", "  There is widespread agreement that ice sheets flowed into the ocean in\ntropical latitudes at sea level during the Earth's past. Whether these extreme\nice ages were snowball Earth events, with the entire surface covered in ice, or\nwhether ocean water remained ice free in regions about the equator, continues\nto be controversial. For the latter situation to occur, the effect of positive\nice albedo feedback would have to be damped to stabilize an advancing ice sheet\nshy of the equator. In this paper we analyze a conceptual model comprised of a\nzonally averaged surface temperature equation coupled to a dynamic ice line\nequation. This difference equation model is aligned with the cold world of\nthese great glacial episodes through an appropriately chosen albedo function.\nUsing the spectral method, the analysis leads to a nonsmooth singular\nperturbation problem. The Hadamard graph transform method is applied to prove\nthe persistence of an invariant manifold, thereby providing insight into model\nbehavior. A stable climate state with the ice line resting in tropical\nlatitudes, but with open water about the equator, is shown to exist. Also\npresented are local smooth and nonsmooth bifurcations as parameters related to\natmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations and the efficiency of meridional heat\ntransport, respectively, are varied.\n", "  In this paper we obtain the entropy of the Kerr black hole for a number of\nmodified theories of gravity. We show that as long as the deviation from\nEinstein Hilbert term consists purely of terms involving scalar curvature and\nRicci tensor, the entropy is solely given by the area law. However, the area\nlaw will be modified by appropriate corrections when we consider terms\ninvolving Riemann tensor explicitly.\n", "  We present the implementation of a Bayesian formalism within the\nStochastically Lighting Up Galaxies (SLUG) stellar population synthesis code,\nwhich is designed to investigate variations in the initial mass function (IMF)\nof star clusters. By comparing observed cluster photometry to large libraries\nof clusters simulated with a continuously varying IMF, our formalism yields the\nposterior probability distribution function (PDF) of the cluster mass, age, and\nextinction, jointly with the parameters describing the IMF. We apply this\nformalism to a sample of star clusters from the nearby galaxy NGC 628, for\nwhich broad-band photometry in five filters is available as part of the Legacy\nExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). After allowing the upper-end slope of the IMF\n($\\alpha_3$) to vary, we recover PDFs for the mass, age, and extinction that\nare broadly consistent with what is found when assuming an invariant Kroupa\nIMF. However, the posterior PDF for $\\alpha_3$ is very broad due to a strong\ndegeneracy with the cluster mass, and it is found to be sensitive to the choice\nof priors, particularly on the cluster mass. We find only a modest improvement\nin the constraining power of $\\alpha_3$ when adding H$\\alpha$ photometry from\nthe companion H$\\alpha$-LEGUS survey. Conversely, H$\\alpha$ photometry\nsignificantly improves the age determination, reducing the frequency of\nmulti-modal PDFs. With the aid of mock clusters we quantify the degeneracy\nbetween physical parameters, showing how constraints on the cluster mass that\nare independent of photometry can be used to pin down the IMF properties of\nstar clusters.\n", "  A utility theory of entanglement is formulated, based on the von\nNeumann--Morgenstern theorem. As a specific example, a protocol for\nmeasurement--induced entanglement is studied, in which the amount of\nentanglement obtained depends on the random result of a measurement on an\nancilla. It is shown that the maximization of the utility requires a\nnon--trivial strategy. The results are especially useful when the interaction\nbetween the ancilla and the systems to be entangled is weak.\n", "  Encoding of spectral information onto monochrome imaging cameras is of\ninterest for wavelength multiplexing and hyperspectral imaging applications.\nHere, the complex spatio-spectral response of a disordered material is used to\ndemonstrate retrieval of a number of discrete wavelengths over a wide spectral\nrange. Strong, diffuse light scattering in a semiconductor nanowire mat is used\nto achieve a highly compact spectrometer of micrometer thickness, transforming\ndifferent wavelengths into distinct speckle patterns with nanometer\nsensitivity. Spatial multiplexing is achieved through the use of a microlens\narray, allowing simultaneous imaging of many speckles, ultimately limited by\nthe size of the diffuse spot area. The performance of different information\nretrieval algorithms is compared. A compressive sensing algorithm exhibits\nefficient reconstruction capability in noisy environments and with only a few\nmeasurements.\n", "  We investigate the statistical behavior of the eigenvalues and diameter of\nrandom Cayley graphs of ${\\rm SL}_2[\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}]$ %and the Symmetric\ngroup $S_n$ as the prime number $p$ goes to infinity. We prove a density\ntheorem for the number of exceptional eigenvalues of random Cayley graphs i.e.\nthe eigenvalues with absolute value bigger than the optimal spectral bound. Our\nnumerical results suggest that random Cayley graphs of ${\\rm\nSL}_2[\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}]$ and the explicit LPS Ramanujan projective graphs\nof $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})$ have optimal spectral gap and\ndiameter as the prime number $p$ goes to infinity.\n", "  The use of resonant depolarization has been suggested for precise beam energy\nmeasurements (better than 100 keV) in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ Future Circular Collider\n(FCC-$e^{+}e^{-}$) for Z and WW physics at 45 and 80 GeV beam energy\nrespectively. Longitudinal beam polarization would benefit the Z peak physics\nprogram; however it is not essential and therefore it will be not investigated\nhere. In this paper the possibility of self-polarized leptons is considered.\nPreliminary results of simulations in presence of quadrupole misalignments and\nbeam position monitors (BPMs) errors for a simplified FCC-$e^{+}e^{-}$ ring are\npresented.\n", "  We derive a characterization of the spectrum of the Sinh-Gordon model in\nterms of certain nonlinear integral equations. There exists a large class of\nsolutions to these equations which allows a continuation between the infrared\nand the ultraviolet limits, respectively. We present nontrivial evidence for\nthe claim that the class of solutions in question describes the spectrum of the\nSinh-Gordon model completely in both of these limits. The evidence includes\nsome nontrivial relations to Liouville theory.\n"]}
