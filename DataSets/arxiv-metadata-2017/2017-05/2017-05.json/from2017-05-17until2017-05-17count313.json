Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful imaging tool that has\nfound broad application in materials science, nanoscience and biology(1-3).\nWith the introduction of aberration-corrected electron lenses, both the spatial\nresolution and image quality in TEM have been significantly improved(4,5) and\nresolution below 0.5 {\\AA} has been demonstrated(6). To reveal the 3D structure\nof thin samples, electron tomography is the method of choice(7-11), with\nresolutions of ~1 nm^3 currently achievable(10,11). Recently, discrete\ntomography has been used to generate a 3D atomic reconstruction of a silver\nnanoparticle 2-3 nm in diameter(12), but this statistical method assumes prior\nknowledge of the particle's lattice structure and requires that the atoms fit\nrigidly on that lattice. Here we report the experimental demonstration of a\ngeneral electron tomography method that achieves atomic scale resolution\nwithout initial assumptions about the sample structure. By combining a novel\nprojection alignment and tomographic reconstruction method with scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy, we have determined the 3D structure of a ~10\nnm gold nanoparticle at 2.4 {\\AA} resolution. While we cannot definitively\nlocate all of the atoms inside the nanoparticle, individual atoms are observed\nin some regions of the particle and several grains are identified at three\ndimensions. The 3D surface morphology and internal lattice structure revealed\nare consistent with a distorted icosahedral multiply-twinned particle. We\nanticipate that this general method can be applied not only to determine the 3D\nstructure of nanomaterials at atomic scale resolution(13-15), but also to\nimprove the spatial resolution and image quality in other tomography\nfields(7,9,16-20).\n", "  For an integral cohomology class H of degree n+2 on a space X, we define\ntwisted Morava K-theory K(n)(X; H) at the prime 2, as well as an integral\nanalogue. We explore properties of this twisted cohomology theory, study a\ntwisted Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, and give a universal coefficient\ntheorem (in the spirit of Khorami). We extend the construction to define\ntwisted Morava E-theory, and provide applications to string theory and\nM-theory.\n", "  We present an electron tomography method that allows for the identification\nof hundreds of electrocatalyst nanoparticles with one-to-one correspondence\nbefore and after electrochemical aging. This method allows us to track, in\nthree-dimensions (3-D), the trajectories and morphologies of each Pt-Co\nnanocatalyst on a fuel cell carbon support. The use of atomic-scale electron\nenergy loss spectroscopic imaging enables the correlation of performance\ndegradation of the catalyst with changes in particle/inter-particle\nmorphologies, particle-support interactions and the near-surface chemical\ncomposition. We found that, aging of the catalysts under normal fuel cell\noperating conditions (potential scans from +0.6 V to +1.0 V for 30,000 cycles)\ngives rise to coarsening of the nanoparticles, mainly through coalescence,\nwhich in turn leads to the loss of performance. The observed coalescence events\nwere found to be the result of nanoparticle migration on the carbon support\nduring potential cycling. This method provides detailed insights into how\nnanocatalyst degradation occurs in proton exchange membrane fuel cells\n(PEMFCs), and suggests that minimization of particle movement can potentially\nslow down the coarsening of the particles, and the corresponding performance\ndegradation.\n", "  We introduce a minimalistic notion of semiclassical quantization and use it\nto prove that the convex hull of the semiclassical spectrum of a quantum system\ngiven by a collection of commuting operators converges to the convex hull of\nthe spectrum of the associated classical system. This gives a quick alternative\nsolution to the isospectrality problem for quantum toric systems. If the\noperators are uniformly bounded, the convergence is uniform. Analogous results\nhold for non-commuting operators.\n", "  We determine all complete projective special real surfaces. By the\nsupergravity r-map, they give rise to complete projective special K\\\"ahler\nmanifolds of dimension 6, which are distinguished by the image of their scalar\ncurvature function. By the supergravity c-map, the latter manifolds define in\nturn complete quaternionic K\\\"ahler manifolds of dimension 16.\n", "  We consider a family of nonlinear recurrences with the Laurent property.\nAlthough these recurrences are not generated by mutations in a cluster algebra,\nthey fit within the broader framework of Laurent phenomenon algebras, as\nintroduced recently by Lam and Pylyavskyy. Furthermore, each member of this\nfamily is shown to be linearisable in two different ways, in the sense that its\niterates satisfy both a linear relation with constant coefficients and a linear\nrelation with periodic coefficients. Associated monodromy matrices and first\nintegrals are constructed, and the connection with the dressing chain for\nSchrodinger operators is also explained.\n", "  We construct a finite element method (FEM) for the infinity Laplacian.\nSolutions of this problem may be singular, which has prompted us to conduct an\na posteriori analysis of the method deriving residual based estimators to drive\nan adaptive algorithm. It is numerically shown that the optimal convergence\nrates are regained upon using the adaptive procedure.\n", "  We study the flow forced by precession in rigid non-axisymmetric ellipsoidal\ncontainers. To do so, we revisit the inviscid and viscous analytical models\nthat have been previously developed for the spheroidal geometry by,\nrespectively, Poincar\\'e (Bull. Astronomique, vol. XXVIII, 1910, pp. 1-36) and\nBusse (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 33, 1968, pp. 739-751), and we report the first\nnumerical simulations of flows in such a geometry. In strong contrast with\naxisymmetric spheroids, where the forced flow is systematically stationary in\nthe precessing frame, we show that the forced flow is unsteady and periodic.\nComparisons of the numerical simulations with the proposed theoretical model\nshow excellent agreement for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric containers.\nFinally, since the studied configuration corresponds to a tidally locked\ncelestial body such as the Earth's Moon, we use our model to investigate the\nchallenging but planetary-relevant limit of very small Ekman numbers and the\nparticular case of our Moon.\n", "  We employ a variational method, in the framework of the Thomas-Fermi\napproximation, to study the effect of the symmetry energy on the neutron skin\nthickness and the symmetry energy coefficients of various neutron rich nuclei.\nWe concentrate our interest on $^{208}$Pb, $^{124}$Sn, $^{90}$Zr, and\n$^{48}$Ca, although the method can be applied in the totality of medium and\nheavy neutron rich nuclei. Our approach has the advantage that the isospin\nasymmetry function $\\alpha(r)$, which is the key quantity to calculate\nisovector properties of various nuclei, is directly related with the symmetry\nenergy as a consequence of the variational principle. Moreover, the Coulomb\ninteraction is included in a self-consistent way and its effects can be\nseparated easily from the nucleon-nucleon interaction. We confirm, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively, the strong dependence of the symmetry energy\non the various isovector properties for the relevant nuclei, using possible\nconstraints between the slope and the value of the symmetry energy at the\nsaturation density.\n", "  In this work we investigate the possibility of using the reflection algebra\nas a source of functional equations. More precisely, we obtain functional\nrelations determining the partition function of the six-vertex model with\ndomain-wall boundary conditions and one reflecting end. The model's partition\nfunction is expressed as a multiple-contour integral that allows the\nhomogeneous limit to be obtained straightforwardly. Our functional equations\nare also shown to give rise to a consistent set of partial differential\nequations for the partition function.\n", "  In this paper, we establish the Knizhnik--Polyakov--Zamolodchikov (KPZ)\nformula of Liouville quantum gravity, using the heat kernel of Liouville\nBrownian motion. This derivation of the KPZ formula was first suggested by F.\nDavid and M. Bauer in order to get a geometrically more intrinsic way of\nmeasuring the dimension of sets in Liouville quantum gravity. We also provide a\ncareful study of the (no)-doubling behaviour of the Liouville measures in the\nappendix, which is of independent interest.\n", "  Let $P_{n}(x)= \\sum_{i=0}^n \\xi_i x^i$ be a Kac random polynomial where the\ncoefficients $\\xi_i$ are iid copies of a given random variable $\\xi$. Our main\nresult is an optimal quantitative bound concerning real roots repulsion. This\nleads to an optimal bound on the probability that there is a double root.\n  As an application, we consider the problem of estimating the number of real\nroots of $P_n$, which has a long history and in particular was the main subject\nof a celebrated series of papers by Littlewood and Offord from the 1940s. We\nshow, for a large and natural family of atom variables $\\xi$, that the expected\nnumber of real roots of $P_n(x)$ is exactly $\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\log n +C +o(1)$,\nwhere $C$ is an absolute constant depending on the atom variable $\\xi$. Prior\nto this paper, such a result was known only for the case when $\\xi$ is\nGaussian.\n", "  We report the observation of a magnetic field assisted transient\nsuperconducting state in the two dimensional electron gas existing at the\ninterface of LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures. This metastable state\ndepends critically on the density of charge carriers in the system. It appears\nconcomitantly with a Lifshitz transition as a consequence of the interplay\nbetween ferromagnetism and superconductivity and the finite relaxation time of\nthe in-plane magnetization. Our results clearly demonstrate the inherently\nmetastable nature of the superconducting state competing with a magnetic order\nin these systems. The co-existence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in\nthe conducting electronic layer formed at the interface of insulating oxides\nhas thrown up several intriguing and as yet unanswered questions. An open\nquestion in this field is the energetics of the interplay between these two\ncompeting orders and the present observation goes a long way in understanding\nthe underlying mechanism.\n", "  We construct monopoles in any asymptotically conical (AC) $3$-manifold $X$\nwith $b^2(X)=0$. For sufficiently large mass, our construction covers an open\nset in the moduli space of monopoles. We also give a more general construction\nof Dirac monopoles in any AC manifold, which may be useful for generalizing our\nresult to the case when $b^2(X) \\neq 0$.\n", "  It follows from the review on classical wave models that the asymmetry of\ncrest and trough is the direct cause for wave drift. Based on this, a new model\nof Lagrangian form is constructed. Relative to the Gerstner model, its\nimprovement is reflected in the horizontal motion which includes an explicit\ndrift term. On the one hand, the depth-decay factor for the new drift accords\nwell with that of the particle's horizontal velocity. It is more rational than\nthat of Stokes drift. On the other hand, the new formula needs no Taylor\nexpansion as for Stokes drift and is applicable for the waves with big slopes.\nIn addition, the new formula can also yield a more rational magnitude for the\nsurface drift than that of Stokes.\n", "  This article reviews the 2008 quantum algorithm for linear systems of\nequations due to Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd, as well as some of the followup\nand related work. It was submitted to the Springer Encyclopedia of Algorithms.\n", "  We theoretically investigate magnetic properties of Sr$_2$TcO$_4$, a 4d\ntransition-metal layered perovskite of the K$_2$NiF$_4$-type with half-filled\nt$_{2g}$ states. The effect of local Coulomb repulsion between the t$_{2g}$\norbitals is included within the density-functional theory (DFT)+U and\nDFT+dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) methods. The DFT+DMFT predicts\nparamagnetic Sr$_2$TcO$_4$ to be close to the Mott insulator-to-metal\ntransition, similarly to the cubic compound SrTcO$_3$. The inter-site exchange\ninteractions computed within the DFT+DMFT framework point to a strong\nantiferromagnetic coupling between the neighboring Tc sites within the layer.\nWe then evaluate the N\\'eel temperature $T_N$ within a classical Monte Carlo\napproach including dipolar interactions, which stabilize the magnetic order in\nthe frustrated K$_2$NiF$_4$ lattice structure. Our approach is applied to a set\nof layered and cubic perovskites. The obtained $T_N$ are in fair agreement with\nexperiment. Within the same approach we predict $T_N$ of Sr$_2$TcO$_4$ to be in\nthe 500-600K range.\n", "  A new estimation of the isotropic diffuse gamma-ray background (IGRB)\nobserved by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space\nTelescope (Fermi) has been presented for 50 months of data, in the energy range\n100 MeV-820 GeV and for different modelings of the Galactic foreground. We\nattempt here the interpretation of the Fermi-LAT IGRB data in terms of the\ngamma-ray unresolved emission from different extragalactic populations. We find\nvery good fits to the experimental IGRB, obtained with theoretical predictions\nfor the emission from active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies. In\naddition, we probe a possible emission coming from the annihilation of weakly\ninteracting dark matter (DM) particles in the halo of our Galaxy. We set\nstringent limits on its annihilation cross section into gamma rays, which are\nabout the thermal relic value for a wide range of DM masses. We also identify\nregions in the DM mass and annihilation cross section parameter space which can\nsignificantly improve the fit to the IGRB data. Our analysis is conducted\nwithin the different IGRB data sets obtained from different models for the\nGalactic emission, which is shown to add a significant ambiguity on the IGRB\ninterpretation.\n", "  We compare the stellar motion around a spiral arm created in two different\nscenarios, transient/co-rotating spiral arms and density-wave-like spiral arms.\nWe generate Gaia mock data from snapshots of the simulations following these\ntwo scenarios using our stellar population code, SNAPDRAGONS, which takes into\naccount dust extinction and the expected Gaia errors. We compare the observed\nrotation velocity around a spiral arm similar in position to the Perseus arm,\nand find that there is a clear difference in the velocity features around the\nspiral arm between the co-rotating spiral arm and the density-wave-like spiral\narm. Our result demonstrates that the volume and accuracy of the Gaia data are\nsufficient to clearly distinguish these two scenarios of the spiral arms.\n", "  We study a coherent-classical estimation scheme for a class of linear quantum\nsystems, where the estimator is a mixed quantum-classical system that may or\nmay not involve coherent feedback. We show that when the quantum plant or the\nquantum part of the estimator (coherent controller) is an annihilation operator\nonly system, coherent-classical estimation without coherent feedback can\nprovide no improvement over purely-classical estimation. Otherwise,\ncoherent-classical estimation without feedback can be better than\nclassical-only estimation for certain homodyne detector angles, although the\nformer is inferior to the latter for the best choice of homodyne detector\nangle. Moreover, we show that coherent-classical estimation with coherent\nfeedback is no better than classical-only estimation, when both the plant and\nthe coherent controller are annihilation operator only systems. Otherwise,\ncoherent-classical estimation with coherent feedback can be superior to\npurely-classical estimation, and in this case, the former is better than the\nlatter for the optimal choice of homodyne detector angle.\n", "  In this paper we discuss two constructions of an effective field theory\nstarting from a local interaction functional. One relies on the\nwell-established graphical combinatorics of the BPHZ algorithm to renormalize\ndivergent Feynman amplitudes. The other, more recent and due to Costello,\nrelies on an inductive construction of local counterterms that uses no\ngraphical combinatorics whatsoever. We show that these two constructions\nproduce the same effective field theory.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate a nonlinear non-autonomous elliptic difference\nequation, which was constructed by Ramani, Carstea and Grammaticos by\nintegrable deautonomization of a periodic reduction of the discrete\nKrichever-Novikov equation, or Q4. We show how to construct it as a birational\nmapping on a rational surface blown up at eight points in $\\mathbb P^1\\times\n\\mathbb P^1$, and find its affine Weyl symmetry, placing it in the geometric\nframework of the Painlev\\'e equations. The initial value space is\nell-$A_0^{(1)}$ and its symmetry group is $W(F_4^{(1)})$. We show that the\ndeautonomization is consistent with the lattice-geometry of Q4 by giving an\nalternative construction, which is a reduction from Q4 in the usual sense. A\nmore symmetric reduction of the same kind provides another example of a\nsecond-order integrable elliptic difference equation.\n", "  A new subtraction procedure for removal both ultraviolet and infrared\ndivergences in Feynman integrals is proposed. This method is developed for\ncomputation of QED corrections to the electron anomalous magnetic moment. The\nprocedure is formulated in the form of a forest formula with linear operators\nthat are applied to Feynman amplitudes of UV-divergent subgraphs. The\ncontribution of each Feynman graph that contains propagators of electrons and\nphotons is represented as a finite Feynman-parametric integral. Application of\nthe developed method to the calculation of 2-loop and 3-loop contributions is\ndescribed.\n", "  Aim of the paper is study weak gravitational lensing of quantum (perturbed)\n(QLBHL) and classical (CLBHL) Lukewarm black hole in presence of cosmological\nparameter $\\Lambda$. We apply numerical method to evaluate deflection angle of\nbending light rays, images locations $\\theta$ of sample source\n$\\beta=-\\frac{\\pi}{4},$ and corresponding magnifications $\\mu.$\n  There is not obtained real values for Einstein rings locations\n$\\theta_E(\\beta=0)$ for CLBHL but we calculate them for QLBHL. As experimental\ntest of our calculations, we choose mass $M$ of 60 type of most massive\nobserved galactic black holes as gravitational lens and study quantum matter\nfields effects on the angle of bending light rays in presence of the\ncosmological constant effects. We calculate locations of non-relativistic\nimages and corresponding magnifications. Numerical diagrams show that the\nquantum matter effects cause to be reduce absolute values of the quantum\ndeflection angle with respect to the classical ones. Sign of the quantum\ndeflection angle is changed with respect to the classical values in presence of\nthe cosmological constant. This means dominance of anti-gravity counterpart of\nthe cosmological horizon on the bending light rays angle with respect to\nabsorbing effects of local 60 type of observed most massive black holes.\nVariations of the image positions and magnifications are negligible by\nincreasing dimensionless cosmological constant $\\epsilon=\\frac{16\\Lambda\nM^2}{3}.$ Deflection angle takes positive (negative) values for CLBHL (QLBHL)\nand they decrease very fast (slow) by increasing closest distance $x_0$ of\nbending light ray and/or dimensionless cosmological parameter for sample giant\nblack holes $0.001<\\epsilon<0.01$.\n", "  The interaction between polymer brush and colloidal particles has been\nintensively studied in the last two decades. Here we consider a flat\nchain-grafted substrate immersed in a bath of active particles. Simulations\nshow that an increase in the self-propelling force causes an increase in the\nnumber of particles that penetrate into the brush. Anomalously, the particle\ndensity inside the main body of the brush eventually becomes higher than that\noutside the brush at very large self-propelling force. The grafted chains are\nfurther stretched due to the steric repulsion from the intruded particles. Upon\nthe increase of the self-propelling force, distinct stretching behaviors of\nchains were observed for low and high grafting densities. Surprisingly, we\nfound a weak descent of the end-to-end distance of chains for high grafting\ndensity and very large force which is reminiscent of the compression effect of\na chain in the active bath.\n", "  Field-theoretical method is efficient in predicting the assembling structures\nof polymeric systems. However, for the polymer/nanoparticle mixture, the\ncontinuous density description is not suitable to capture the realistic\nassembly of particles, especially when the size of particle is much larger than\nthe polymer segment. Here, we developed a field-based model, in which the\nparticles are eventually discrete and hence it can overcome the drawbacks of\nthe conventional field descriptions, e.g., inadequate and crude treatment on\nthe polymer-particle interface and the excluded-volume interaction. We applied\nthe model to study the simplest system of nanoparticles immersed in dense\nhomopolymer solution. Our model can address the depletion effect and\ninterfacial interaction in a more delicate way. Insights into the enthalpic\nand/or entropic origin of the structural variation due to the competition\nbetween depletion and interfacial interaction are obtained. New phenomena such\nas depletion-enhanced bridging aggregation are observed in the case of strong\ninterfacial attraction and large depletion length. This approach is readily\nextendable to studying more complex polymer-based nanocomposites or\nbiology-related systems, such as dendrimer/drug encapsulation and\nmembrane/particle assembly.\n", "  The oriented attachment (OA) of nanoparticles is an important mechanism for\nthe synthesis of the crystals of inorganic functional materials, and the\nformation of natural minerals. For years it has been generally acknowledged\nthat OA is a physical process, i.e., particle alignments and interface fusion\nvia mass diffusion, not involving the formation of new substances. Hence, the\nobtained crystals maintain identical crystallographic structures and chemical\nconstituents to those of the precursor particles. Here we report a chemical\nreaction directed OA growth, through which Y2(CO3)3.2H2O nanoparticles are\nconverted to single-crystalline double-carbonates (e.g., NaY(CO3)2.6H2O). The\ndominant role of OA growth is supported by our first-principles calculations.\nSuch a new OA mechanism enriches the aggregation-based crystal growth theory.\n", "  We consider tunneling of spinless electrons from a single channel emitter\ninto an empty collector through an interacting resonant level of the quantum\ndot. When all Coulomb screening of sudden charge variations of the dot during\nthe tunneling is realized by the emitter channel, the system is described with\nan exactly solvable model of a dissipative qubit. We derive the correspondent\nBloch equation for its quantum evolution. We further use it to specify the\nqubit transient dynamics towards its stationary quantum state after sudden\nchange of the level position. We demonstrate that the time-dependent tunneling\ncurrent characterizing this dynamics exhibits an oscillating behavior for a\nwide range of the model parameters.\n", "  The non-equilibrium thermodynamics of a gas inside a piston is a conceptually\nsimple problem where analytic results are rare. For example, it is hard to find\nin the literature analytic formulas that describe the heat exchanged with the\nreservoir when the system either relaxes to equilibrium or is compressed over a\nfinite time. In this paper we derive such kind of analytic formulas. To achieve\nthis result, we take the equations derived by Cerino \\textit{et al.} [Phys.\nRev. E \\textbf{91}, 032128] describing the dynamic evolution of a gas-piston\nsystem, we cast them in a dimensionless form and we solve the dimensionless\nequations with the multiple scales expansion method. With the approximated\nsolutions we obtained, we express in a closed form the heat exchanged by the\ngas-piston system with the reservoir for a large class of relevant\nnon-equilibrium situations.\n", "  We analyse the trapping of eigenspinors of the charge conjugation operator\nwith dual helicity (Elko), in thin and thick string-like models with\ncodimension-2. Elko spinor fields describe mass dimension one fermions in four\ndimensions (and, correspondingly, mass dimension two fermions in six\ndimensions), that represent natural dark matter prime candidates. This dark\nspinor has many applications, from particle physics to cosmology. On the other\nhand, six-dimensional brane-world models have, among other prominent features,\nthe spontaneous confinement of free spin 1 fields and a mechanism that explains\nthe mass hierarchy of fundamental fermions. In this paper, we use scalar\ncouplings in order to confine the zero mode of Elko in six dimensions.\nMoreover, we use the Elko dark spinor features to propose an exotic coupling in\norder to remove the complex-valued terms in the massive Kaluza-Klein modes.\nHence, we show that six dimensional models can resolve the main issues of Elko\nfields confinement presented in five dimensions.\n", "  We propose a new type of radiative neutrino model with global hidden $U(1)$\nsymmetry, in which neutrino masses are induced at the four loop level. Then we\ndiscuss the muon anomalous magnetic moment to solve the discrepancy between\nobservation and the standard model prediction, and estimate the relic density\nof a fermion or boson DM candidate in the model. We also discuss the diphoton\nresonance $R$ by considering a process $pp \\to R \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ as a\npossible signal of our model.\n", "  In this work, we propose a method for calculating the free energy of\nanisotropic quantum spin systems. We use the Hubbard-Stratonovich\ntransformation to express the partition function of a generic bilinear\nsuper-exchange Hamiltonian in terms of a functional integral over classical\ntime-dependent fields. In the general case the result is presented as an\ninfinite series. The series may be summed up in the case of Ising-type models.\nFor any ordered state we derive a compact expression for the contribution of\nGaussian spin fluctuations to the free energy.\n", "  We report quantitative experimental measurements of the Abraham force\nassociated with a propagating optical wave. We isolate this force using a\nguided light wave undergoing an adiabatic mode transformation (AMT) along a\nliquid-filled hollow optical fiber (HOF). Utilizing this light intensity\ndistribution within the liquid, we were able to generate a time-averaged\nnon-vanishing Abraham force density, while simultaneously suppressing the\nAbraham-Minkowski force density. The incident laser field induced a linear\naxial displacement of the air-liquid interface inside the HOF, which provided a\ndirect experimental measure of the Abraham force density. We find good\nagreement between the experimental results and theoretical determinations of\nthe Abraham force density\n", "  We have modeled hydrodynamical tori in the Klu{\\'z}niak-Lee pseudo-Newtonian\npotential. The tori in equilibrium were perturbed with uniform sub-sonic\nvelocity fields: vertical, radial and diagonal respectively, and allowed to\nevolve in time. We identify the eigenmodes corresponding to those of slender\ntori. The results of our simulations are relevant to the investigation of\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in stellar-mass black hole\nbinaries.\n", "  Dissipation tends to wash out dynamical features observed at early evolution\ntimes. In this paper we analyze a resonant single--atom two--photon quantum\noptical amplifier both dynamically and thermodynamically. A detailed\nthermodynamic balance shows that the non--linear amplifier is thermodynamically\nequivalent to the linear amplifier discussed in (Phys. Rev. A, 74 (2006),\n063822). However, by calculating the Wigner quasi--probability distribution for\nvarious initial field states, we show that unique quantum features in optical\nphase space, absent from the linear amplifier, are maintained for extended\ntimes. These features are related to the discrete nature of the two--photon\nmatter--field interaction, and fingerprint the initial field state at\nthermodynamic times.\n", "  We study the Fermi-Hubbard model in the strongly correlated Mott phase under\nthe influence of a harmonically oscillating electric field, e.g., a pump laser.\nIn the Peierls representation, this pump field can be represented as an\noscillating phase of the hopping rate $J(t)$, such that the effective\ntime-averaged rate $\\bar J$ is reduced, i.e., switching the pump laser suddenly\nis analogous to a quantum quench. Apart from this time-averaged rate $\\bar J$,\nit is well known that the oscillating component of $J(t)$ can resonantly create\nparticle-hole pairs if the pump frequency $\\omega_{\\rm pump}$ equals (or a\nlittle exceeds) the Mott gap. In addition, we find that it is possible to\ncreate multiple pairs if $\\omega_{\\rm pump}$ is near an integer multiple of the\ngap. These findings should be relevant for pump-probe experiments.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the effect of transverse magnetic anisotropy on\nspin-flip assisted tunneling through atomic spin chains. Using a\nphenomenological approach and first-order perturbation theory, we analytically\ncalculate the inelastic tunneling current, differential conductance and atomic\nspin transition rates. We predict the appearance of additional steps in the\ndifferential conductance and a pronounced increase in the spin-flip transition\nrate which at low voltages scale quadratically with the ratio of the transverse\nanisotropy energy and the sum of the longitudinal anisotropy energy and the\nexchange energy. Our results provide intuitive quantitative insight in the role\nplayed by transverse anisotropy in inelastic tunneling spectroscopy of atomic\nchains and can be observed under realistic experimental conditions.\n", "  In recent years, superconducting qubits show great potential in quantum\ncomputation. Hence, microwave photons become very interesting qubits for\nquantum information processing assisted by superconducting quantum computation.\nHere, we present the first protocol for the entanglement concentration on\nmicrowave photons, resorting to the cross-Kerr effect in circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED). Two superconducting transmission line resonators (TLRs)\ncoupled to superconducting molecule with the N-type level structure induce the\neffective cross-Kerr effect for realizing the quantum nondemolition (QND)\nmeasurement on microwave photons. With this device, we present a two-qubit\npolarization parity QND detector on the photon states of the superconducting\nTLRs, which can be used to concentrate efficiently the nonlocal non-maximally\nentangled states of microwave photons assisted by several linear microwave\nelements. This protocol has a high efficiency and it may be useful for\nsolid-state quantum information processing assisted by microwave photons.\n", "  The curse of dimensionality associated with the Hilbert space of spin systems\nprovides a significant obstruction to the study of condensed matter systems.\nTensor networks have proven an important tool in attempting to overcome this\ndifficulty in both the numerical and analytic regimes.\n  These notes form the basis for a seven lecture course, introducing the basics\nof a range of common tensor networks and algorithms. In particular, we cover:\nintroductory tensor network notation, applications to quantum information,\nbasic properties of matrix product states, a classification of quantum phases\nusing tensor networks, algorithms for finding matrix product states, basic\nproperties of projected entangled pair states, and multiscale entanglement\nrenormalisation ansatz states.\n  The lectures are intended to be generally accessible, although the relevance\nof many of the examples may be lost on students without a background in\nmany-body physics/quantum information. For each lecture, several problems are\ngiven, with worked solutions in an ancillary file.\n", "  Luttinger holes with strong Zeemann and spin-orbit interactions in a wire\nproximity-coupled to a superconductor is a promising system for observation of\nMajorana fermions. Earlier treatments of confined Luttinger holes in wires\nignored a mutual transformation of heavy and light holes upon reflection from\nthe heteroboundaries. This effect is crucial for Zeemann and spin-orbit\ncoupling in the ground subband of holes with several spin-orbit terms linear in\nmomentum. We discuss the criterion for realizing Majorana modes in charge\ncarrier hole systems. GaAs or InSb hole wires shall exhibit stronger\ntopological superconducting pairing compared to InSb electron systems in\nsimilar or weaker magnetic fields.\n", "  In this paper we consider a layered heterostructure of an Abelian\ntopologically ordered state (TO), such as a fractional Chern insulator/quantum\nHall state with an s-wave superconductor in order to explore the existence of\nnon-Abelian defects. In order to uncover such defects we must augment the\noriginal TO by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory sector coming from the s-wave SC.\nWe first determine the extended TO for a wide variety of fractional quantum\nHall or fractional Chern insulator heterostructures. We prove the existence of\na general anyon permutation symmetry (AS) that exists in any fermionic Abelian\nTO state in contact with an s-wave superconductor. Physically this permutation\ncorresponds to adding a fermion to an odd flux vortices (in units of $h/2e$) as\nthey travel around the associated topological (twist) defect. As such, we call\nit a fermion parity flip AS. We consider twist defects which mutate anyons\naccording to the fermion parity flip symmetry and show that they can be\nrealized at domain walls between distinct gapped edges or interfaces of the TO\nsuperconducting state. We analyze the properties of such defects and show that\nfermion parity flip twist defects are always associated with Majorana zero\nmodes. Our formalism also reproduces known results such as\nMajorana/parafermionic bound states at superconducting domain walls of\ntopological/Fractional Chern insulators when twist defects are constructed\nbased on charge conjugation symmetry. Finally, we briefly describe more exotic\ntwist liquid phases obtained by gauging the AS where the twist defects become\ndeconfined anyonic excitations.\n", "  We derive a general dimensionless form for granular locomotion, which is\nvalidated in experiments and Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. The\nform instructs how to scale size, mass, and driving parameters in order to\nrelate dynamic behaviors of different locomotors in the same granular media.\nThe scaling can be derived by assuming intrusion forces arise from Resistive\nForce Theory (RFT) or equivalently by assuming the granular material behaves as\na continuum obeying a frictional yield criterion. The scalings are\nexperimentally confirmed using pairs of wheels of various shapes and sizes\nunder many driving conditions in a common sand bed. We discuss why the two\nmodels provide such a robust set of scaling laws even though they neglect a\nnumber of the complexities of granular rheology. Motivated by potential\nextra-planetary applications, the dimensionless form also implies a way to\npredict wheel performance in one ambient gravity based on tests in a different\nambient gravity. We confirm this using DEM simulations, which show that scaling\nrelations are satisfied over an array of driving modes even when gravity\ndiffers between scaled tests.\n", "  Altering the optics in one section of a linear accelerator beamline will in\ngeneral cause an alteration of the optics in all downstream sections. In\ncircular accelerators, changing the optical properties of any beamline element\nwill have an impact on the optical functions throughout the whole machine. In\nmany cases, however, it is desirable to change the optics in a certain beamline\nsection without disturbing any other parts of the machine. Such a local optics\nmanipulation can be achieved by adjusting a number of additional corrector\nmagnets that restore the initial optics after the manipulated section. In that\ncase, the effect of the manipulation is confined in the region between the\nmanipulated and the correcting beamline elements. Introducing a manipulation\ncontinuously, while the machine is operating, therefore requires continuous\ncorrection functions to be applied to the correcting quadrupole magnets.\n  In this paper we present an analytic approach to calculate such continuous\ncorrection functions for six quadrupole magnets by means of a homotopy method.\nBesides a detailed derivation of the method, we present its application to an\nalgebraic example, as well as its implementation at the seeding experiment\nsFLASH at the free-electron laser FLASH located at DESY in Hamburg.\n", "  Weyl fermions can be created in materials with both time reversal and\ninversion symmetry by applying a magnetic field, as evidenced by recent\nmeasurements of anomalous negative magnetoresistance. Here, we do a thorough\nanalysis of the Weyl points in these materials: by enforcing crystal\nsymmetries, we classify the location and monopole charges of Weyl points\ncreated by fields aligned with high-symmetry axes. The analysis applies\ngenerally to materials with band inversion in the $T_d$, $D_{4h}$ and $D_{6h}$\npoint groups. For the $T_d$ point group, we find that Weyl nodes persist for\nall directions of the magnetic field. Further, we compute the anomalous\nmagnetoresistance of field-created Weyl fermions in the semiclassical regime.\nWe find that the magnetoresistance can scale non-quadratically with magnetic\nfield, in contrast to materials with intrinsic Weyl nodes. Our results are\nrelevant to future experiments in the semi-classical regime.\n", "  We propose an arbitrary driven spin as the working fluid of a quantum Otto\ncycle in the presence of internal friction. The role of total allocated time to\nthe adiabatic branches of the cycle, generated by different control field\nprofiles, on the extractable work and the thermal efficiency are analyzed in\ndetail. The internal friction is characterized by the excess entropy production\nand quantitatively determined by studying the closeness of an actual unitary\nprocess to an infinitely long one via quantum relative entropy. It is found\nthat the non-ideal, finite-time adiabatic transformations negatively effect the\nwork output and the thermal efficiency of the quantum heat engine. The\nnon-monotone dependence of the work output, thermal efficiency, entropy\nproduction and the internal friction on the total adiabatic time are\nelucidated. It is also found that almost frictionless adiabatic transformations\nwith small entropy production can be obtained in a short adiabatic time.\n", "  Time-varying community structures widely exist in various real-world\nnetworks. However, the spreading dynamics on this kind of network has not been\nfully studied. To this end, we systematically study the effects of time-varying\ncommunity structures on social contagions. We first propose a non-Markovian\nsocial contagion model on time-varying community networks based on the activity\ndriven network model, in which an individual adopts a behavior if and only if\nthe accumulated behavioral information it has ever received reaches a\nthreshold. Then, we develop a mean-field theory to describe the proposed model.\nFrom theoretical analyses and numerical simulations, we find that behavior\nadoption in the social contagions exhibits a hierarchical feature, i.e., the\nbehavior first quickly spreads in one of the communities, and then outbreaks in\nthe other. Moreover, under different behavioral information transmission rates,\nthe final behavior adoption proportion in the whole network versus the\ncommunity strength shows one of the patterns, which are a monotone increasing\npattern, a non-monotonic changing pattern, and a monotone decreasing pattern.\nAn optimal community strength maximizing the final behavior adoption can be\nfound in a suitable range of behavioral information transmission rate. Finally,\nfor a given average degree, increasing the number of edges generated by active\nnodes is more beneficial to the social contagions than increasing the average\nactivity potential.\n", "  The structure of the initial system-environment state is fundamental to\ndetermining the nature and characteristics of the evolution of such an open\nquantum system. The usual assumption is to consider that the initial\nsystem-environment state is separable. Here, we go beyond this simple case and\nderive the evolution equations, up to second order in a weak-coupling\nexpansion, that describe the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the\nsystem for any arbitrary system-environment initial state. The structure of\nthese equations allows us to determine the initial conditions for which a\nLindblad form can be recovered once applying the Markov and secular\napproximations.\n", "  In supervised learning, an inductive learning algorithm extracts general\nrules from observed training instances, then the rules are applied to test\ninstances. We show that this splitting of training and application arises\nnaturally, in the classical setting, from a simple independence requirement\nwith a physical interpretation of being non-signalling. Thus, two seemingly\ndifferent definitions of inductive learning happen to coincide. This follows\nfrom the properties of classical information that break down in the quantum\nsetup. We prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for quantum channels, which shows\nthat in the quantum case, the equivalence holds in the asymptotic setting, that\nis, for large number of test instances. This reveals a natural analogy between\nclassical learning protocols and their quantum counterparts, justifying a\nsimilar treatment, and allowing to inquire about standard elements in\ncomputational learning theory, such as structural risk minimization and sample\ncomplexity.\n", "  Our understanding of the Universe is known to be incomplete and new gauge\nforces beyond those of the Standard Model might be crucial to describing its\nobserved properties. A minimal and well-motivated possibility is a pure\nYang-Mills non-Abelian dark gauge force with no direct connection to the\nStandard Model. We determine here the relic abundances of the glueball bound\nstates that arise in such theories and investigate their cosmological effects.\nGlueballs are first formed in a confining phase transition, and their relic\ndensities are set by a network of annihilation and transfer reactions. The\nlightest glueball has no lighter states to annihilate into, and its yield is\nset mainly by 3 to 2 number-changing processes which persistently release\nenergy into the glueball gas during freeze-out. The abundances of the heavier\nglueballs are dominated by 2 to 2 transfer reactions, and tend to be much\nsmaller than the lightest state. We also investigate potential connectors\nbetween the dark force and the Standard Model that allow some or all of the\ndark glueballs to decay. If the connection is weak, the lightest glueball can\nbe very long-lived or stable and is a viable dark matter candidate. For\nstronger connections, the lightest glueball will decay quickly but other\nheavier glueball states can remain stable and contribute to the dark matter\ndensity.\n", "  Topological phases of matter are one of the hallmarks of quantum condensed\nmatter physics. One of their striking features is a bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence wherein the topological nature of the bulk manifests itself on\nboundaries via exotic massless phases. In classical wave phenomena analogous\neffects may arise; however, these cannot be viewed as equilibrium phases of\nmatter. Here we identify a set of rules under which robust equilibrium\nclassical topological phenomena exist. We write down simple and analytically\ntractable classical lattice models of spins and rotors in two and three\ndimensions which, at suitable parameter ranges, are paramagnetic in the bulk\nbut nonetheless exhibit some unusual long-range or critical order on their\nboundaries. We point out the role of simplicial cohomology as a means of\nclassifying, writing-down, and analyzing such models. This opens a new\nexperimental route for studying strongly interacting topological phases of\nspins.\n", "  Reliable and validated assessments of introductory physics have been\ninstrumental in driving curricular and pedagogical reforms that lead to\nimproved student learning. As part of an effort to systematically improve our\nsophomore-level Classical Mechanics and Math Methods course (CM 1) at CU\nBoulder, we have developed a tool to assess student learning of CM 1 concepts\nin the upper-division. The Colorado Classical Mechanics/Math Methods Instrument\n(CCMI) builds on faculty consensus learning goals and systematic observations\nof student difficulties. The result is a 9-question open-ended post-test that\nprobes student learning in the first half of a two-semester classical mechanics\n/ math methods sequence. In this paper, we describe the design and development\nof this instrument, its validation, and measurements made in classes at CU\nBoulder and elsewhere.\n", "  We introduce a cluster DMFT (Dynamical Mean Field Theory) approach to study\nthe normal state of the iron pnictides and chalcogenides. In the regime of\nmoderate mass renormalizations, the self-energy is very local, justifying the\nsuccess of single site DMFT for these materials and for other Hunds metals. We\nsolve the corresponding impurity model with CTQMC (Continuous Time Quantum\nMonte-Carlo) and find that the minus sign problem is not severe in regimes of\nmoderate mass renormalization.\n", "  We propose a theoretical principle to measure the mass, spin and direction of\nspin axis of Kerr black holes (BHs) through observing 2 quantities of the\nspinning strong gravitational lens effect of BHs. Those observable quantities\nare generated by 2 light rays emitted at the same time by a source near the BH:\nthe primary and secondary rays that reach a distant observer, respectively, the\nearliest and secondary temporally. The time delay between detection times and\nthe ratio of observed specific fluxes of those rays are the observable\nquantities. Rigorously, our proposal is applicable to a single burst-like\n(short duration) isotropic emission by the source. An extension of our\nprinciple to cases of complicated emissions may be constructed by summing up\nappropriately the result of this paper, which will be treated in future works.\n", "  Using the test-particle method to solve the transport equation derived from\nthe Nambu-Jona-Lasino (NJL) model, we study how phase separation occurs in an\nexpanding quark matter like that in a heavy ion collision. To test our method,\nwe first investigate the growth rates of unstable modes of quark matter in a\nstatic cubic box and find them to agree with the analytical results that were\npreviously obtained using the linear response theory. In this case, we also\nfind the higher-order scaled density moments to increase with time and saturate\nat values significantly larger than one, which corresponds to a uniform density\ndistribution, after the phase separation. The skewness of the quark number\nevent-by-event distribution in a small sub-volume of the system is also found\nto increase, but this feature disappears if the sub-volume is large. For the\nexpanding quark matter, two cases are considered with one using a blast-wave\nmodel for the initial conditions and the other using initial conditions from a\nmulple-phase transport (AMPT) model. In both cases, we find the expansion of\nthe quark matter is slowed down by the presence of a first-order phase\ntransition. Also, density clumps appear in the system and the momentum\ndistribution of partons becomes anisotropic , which can be characterized by\nlarge scaled density moments and non-vanishing anisotropic elliptic and\nquadrupolar flows, respectively. The large density fluctuations further lead to\nan enhancement in the dilepton yield. In the case with the AMPT initial\nconditions, the presence of a first-order phase transition also results in a\nnarrower rapidity distribution of partons after their freeze out. These effects\nof density fluctuations can be regarded as possible signals for a first-order\nphase transition that occurs in the baryon-rich quark matter formed in\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions.\n", "  We show that if the $\\alpha$-attractor model is realized by the spontaneous\nbreaking of the scale symmetry, then the stability and the dynamics of the\nvector field that gauges the scale symmetry can severely constrain the\n$\\alpha$-parameter as $5/6 < \\alpha < 1$ restricting the inflationary\npredictions in a very tiny region in the $n_s - r$ plane that are in great\nagreement with the latest Planck data. Although the different values of\n$\\alpha$ do not make a tangible difference for $n_s$ and $r$, they provide\nradically different scenarios for the post-inflationary dynamics which\ndetermines the standard BBN processes and the large scale isotropy of the\nuniverse.\n", "  We probe the relaxation dynamics of the full three-level spin system of\nnear-surface nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to define a $T_{1}$\nrelaxation time that helps resolve the $T_{2} \\leq 2T_{1}$ coherence limit of\nthe NV's subset qubit superpositions. We find that double-quantum spin\nrelaxation via electric field noise dominates $T_{1}$ of near-surface NVs at\nlow applied magnetic fields. Furthermore, we differentiate $1/f^{\\alpha}$\nspectra of electric and magnetic field noise using a novel noise-spectroscopy\ntechnique, with broad applications in probing surface-induced decoherence at\nmaterial interfaces.\n", "  A (Quantum) Random Access Code ((Q)RAC) is a scheme that encodes $n$ bits\ninto $m$ (qu)bits such that any of the $n$ bits can be recovered with a worst\ncase probability $p>\\frac{1}{2}$. Such a code is denoted by the triple\n$(n,m,p)$. It is known that $n<4^m$ for all QRACs and $n<2^m$ for classical\nRACs. These bounds are also known to be tight, as explicit constructions exist\nfor $n=4^m-1$ and $n=2^m-1$ for quantum and classical codes respectively. We\ngeneralize (Q)RACs to a scheme encoding $n$ $d$-levels into $m$ (qu)-$d$-levels\nsuch that any $d$-level can be recovered with the probability for every wrong\noutcome value being less than $\\frac{1}{d}$. We construct explicit solutions\nfor all $n\\leq \\frac{d^{2m}-1}{d-1}$. For $d=2$, the constructions coincide\nwith those previously known. We show that the (Q)RACs are $d$-parity-oblivious,\ngeneralizing ordinary parity-obliviousness. We further investigate optimization\nof the success probabilities. For $d=2$, we use the measure operators of the\npreviously best known solutions, but improve the encoding states to give a\nhigher success probability. We conjecture that for maximal $(n=4^m-1,m,p)$\nQRACs, $p=\\frac{1+\\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{3}+1)^m-1}}{2}$ is possible and show that it\nis an upper bound for the measure operators that we use. When we compare\n$(n,m,p_q)$ QRACs with classical $(n,2m,p_c)$ RACs, we can always find $p_q\\geq\np_c$, but the classical code gives information about every input bit\nsimultaneously, while the QRAC only gives information about a subset. For\nseveral different $(n,2,p)$ QRACs, we see the same trade-off, as the best $p$\nvalues are obtained when the number of bits that can be obtained simultaneously\nis as small as possible. The trade-off is connected to parity-obliviousness,\nsince high certainty information about several bits can be used to calculate\nprobabilities for parities of subsets.\n", "  We prove the existence of an infinite number of internal (shape) modes of\nsine-Gordon solitons in the presence of some inhomogeneous long-range forces,\nprovided some conditions are satisfied.\n", "  We demonstrate a SWAP gate between laser-cooled ions in a segmented microtrap\nvia fast physical swapping of the ion positions. This operation is used in\nconjunction with qubit initialization, manipulation and readout, and with other\ntypes of shuttling operations such as linear transport and crystal separation\nand merging. Combining these operations, we perform quantum process tomography\nof the SWAP gate, obtaining a mean process fidelity of 99.5(5)\\%. The swap\noperation is demonstrated with motional excitations below 0.05(1)~quanta for\nall six collective modes of a two-ion crystal, for a process duration of\n42~$\\mu$s. Extending these techniques to three ions, we reverse the order of a\nthree-ion crystal and reconstruct the truth table for this operation, resulting\nin a mean process fidelity of 99.96(13)\\% in the logical basis.\n", "  We study the static cosmological solutions and their stability at background\nlevel in the framework of massive bigravity theory with\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metrics. By the modification proposed in the\ncosmological equations subject to a perfect fluid we obtain new solutions\ninterpreted as the Einstein static universe. It turns out that the\nnon-vanishing size of initial scale factor of Einstein static universe depends\non the non-vanishing three-dimensional spatial curvature of FRW metrics and\nalso the graviton's mass. By dynamical system approach and numerical analysis,\nwe find that the extracted solutions for closed and open universes can be\nstable for some viable ranges of equation of state parameter, viable values of\nfraction of two scale factors, and viable values of graviton's mass obeying the\nhierarchy $m << M_Pl$ which is more cosmologically motivated.\n", "  When quantum fields are coupled to gravitational fields, spontaneous particle\ncreation may occur similarly to when they are coupled to external\nelectromagnetic fields. Gravitational fields can be incorporated as background\nspacetime if the back-action of matter on it can be neglected, yielding\nmodified Dirac or Klein-Gordon equations for elementary fermions and bosons\nrespectively. The semi-classical description predicts particle creation in many\nscenarios including expanding universe, near the event horizon of a black hole\n(the Hawking effect), and an accelerating observer in flat spacetime (the Unruh\neffect). In this work, we give a pedagogical introduction to the Dirac equation\nin a general 2D spacetime and show examples of spinor wave packet dynamics in\nsome background spacetimes. In particular, we cover the phenomenon of particle\ncreation in a time-dependent metric. Photonic analogs of these effects are then\nproposed, where classical light propagating in an array of coupled waveguides\nprovides a visualisation of the Dirac spinor propagating in curved 2D\nspacetime. The extent to which such a single-particle description can be said\nto mimic particle creation is discussed.\n", "  We present a new method to close the Master Equation representing the\ncontinuous time dynamics of Ising interacting spins. The method makes use of\nthe the theory of Random Point Processes to derive a master equation for local\nconditional probabilities. We analytically test our solution studying two known\ncases, the dynamics of the mean field ferromagnet and the dynamics of the one\ndimensional Ising system. We then present numerical results comparing our\npredictions with Monte Carlo simulations in three different models on random\ngraphs with finite connectivity: the Ising ferromagnet, the Random Field Ising\nmodel, and the Viana-Bray spin-glass model.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the relation of particle number cumulants and\ncorrelation functions. It is argued that measuring couplings of the genuine\nmulti-particle correlation functions could provide cleaner information on\npossible non-trivial dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. We extract integrated\nmulti-proton correlation functions from the presently available experimental\ndata on proton cumulants. We find that the STAR data contain significant\nfour-proton correlations, at least at the lower energies, with indication of\nchanging dynamics in central collisions. We also find that these correlations\nare rather long-ranged in rapidity. Finally, using the Ising model, we\ndemonstrate how the signs of the multi-proton correlation functions may be used\nto exclude certain regions of the phase diagram close to the critical point.\n", "  Emission of high-order harmonics from solids provides a new avenue in\nattosecond science. On one hand, it allows to investigate fundamental processes\nof the non-linear response of electrons driven by a strong laser pulse in a\nperiodic crystal lattice. On the other hand, it opens new paths toward\nefficient attosecond pulse generation, novel imaging of electronic wave\nfunctions, and enhancement of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) intensity. A\nkey feature of HHG in a solid (as compared to the well-understood phenomena of\nHHG in an atomic gas) is the delocalization of the process, whereby an electron\nionized from one site in the periodic lattice may recombine with any other.\nHere, we develop an analytic model, based on the localized Wannier wave\nfunctions in the valence band and delocalized Bloch functions in the conduction\nband. This Wannier-Bloch approach assesses the contributions of individual\nlattice sites to the HHG process, and hence addresses precisely the question of\nlocalization of harmonic emission in solids. We apply this model to investigate\nHHG in a ZnO crystal for two different orientations, corresponding to wider and\nnarrower valence and conduction bands, respectively. Interestingly, for\nnarrower bands, the HHG process shows significant localization, similar to\nharmonic generation in atoms. For all cases, the delocalized contributions to\nHHG emission are highest near the band-gap energy. Our results pave the way to\ncontrolling localized contributions to HHG in a solid crystal, with hard to\noverestimate implications for the emerging area of atto-nanoscience.\n", "  Hydrodynamic interactions in systems comprised of self-propelled particles,\nsuch as swimming microorganisms, and passive tracers have a significant impact\non the tracer dynamics compared to the equivalent \"dry\" sample. However, such\ninteractions are often difficult to take into account in simulations due to\ntheir computational cost. Here, we perform a systematic investigation of\nswimmer-tracer interaction using an efficient force/counter-force based\nlattice-Boltzmann (LB) algorithm [J. de Graaf~\\textit{et al.}, J. Chem.\nPhys.~\\textbf{144}, 134106 (2016)] in order to validate its ability to capture\nthe relevant low-Reynolds-number physics. We show that the LB algorithm\nreproduces far-field theoretical results well, both in a system with periodic\nboundary conditions and in a spherical cavity with no-slip walls, for which we\nderive expressions here. The force-lattice coupling of the LB algorithm leads\nto a \"smearing out\" of the flow field, which strongly perturbs the tracer\ntrajectories at close swimmer-tracer separations, and we analyze how this\neffect can be accurately captured using a simple renormalized hydrodynamic\ntheory. Finally, we show that care must be taken when using LB algorithms to\nsimulate systems of self-propelled particles, since its finite momentum\ntransport time can lead to significant deviations from theoretical predictions\nbased on Stokes flow. These insights should prove relevant to the future study\nof large-scale microswimmer suspensions using these methods.\n", "  We investigate the behaviour of the eigenvalues of two-dimensional Pauli\noperators with nonconstant magnetic fields perturbed by a sign-indefinite\ndecaying electric potential V. We prove new eigenvalues asymptotics.\n", "  We apply Feshbach-Krein-Schur renormalization techniques in the hierarchical\nAnderson model to establish a criterion on the single-site distribution which\nensures exponential dynamical localization as well as positive inverse\nparticipation ratios and Poisson statistics of eigenvalues. Our criterion\napplies to all cases of exponentially decaying hierarchical hopping strengths\nand holds even for spectral dimension $d > 2$, which corresponds to the regime\nof transience of the underlying hierarchical random walk. This challenges\nrecent numerical findings that the spectral dimension is significant as far as\nthe Anderson transition is concerned.\n", "  Plasma high harmonics generation from an extremely intense short-pulse laser\nis explored by including the effects of ion motion, electron-ion collisions and\nradiation reaction force in the plasma dynamics. The laser radiation pressure\ninduces plasma ion motion through the hole-boring effect resulting into the\nfrequency shifting and widening of the harmonic spectra. Classical radiation\nreaction force slightly mitigates the frequency broadening caused by the ion\nmotion. Based on the results and physical considerations, parameter maps\nhighlighting optimum regions for generating a single intense attosecond pulse\nand coherent XUV radiations are presented.\n", "  The isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change for the\nexactly solved spin-1/2 Fisher's super-exchange antiferromagnet are rigorously\ncalculated in order to examine magnetocaloric properties of the model in a\nvicinity of the second-order phase transition. It is shown that the large\ninverse magnetocaloric effect occurs around the temperature interval\n$T_c(h\\neq0) < T < T_c(h=0)$ for any magnetic-field change $\\Delta h: 0 \\to h$.\nThe most pronounced inverse magnetocaloric effect can be found for the\nmagnetic-field change, which coincides with the critical field of a\nzero-temperature phase transition from the antiferromagnetically ordered ground\nstate to the paramagnetic one.\n", "  Long-term sunspot observations are key to understand and predict the solar\nactivities and its effects on the space weather.Consistent observations which\nare crucial for long-term variations studies,are generally not available due to\nupgradation/modifications of observatories over the course of time. We present\nthe data for a period of 90 years acquired from persistent observation at the\nKodaikanal observatory in India. We use an advanced semi-automated algorithm to\ndetect the sunspots form each calibrated white-light image. Area, longitude and\nlatitude of each of the detected sunspots are derived. Implementation of a\nsemi-automated method is very necessary in such studies as it minimizes the\nhuman bias in the detection procedure. Daily, monthly and yearly sunspot area\nvariations obtained from the Kodaikanal, compared well with the Greenwich\nsunspot area data. We find an exponentially decaying distribution for the\nindividual sunspot area for each of the solar cycles. Analyzing the histograms\nof the latitudinal distribution of the detected sunspots, we find Gaussian\ndistributions, in both the hemispheres, with the centers at $\\sim$15$^{\\circ}$\nlatitude. The height of the Gaussian distributions are different for the two\nhemispheres for a particular cycle. Using our data, we show clear presence of\nWaldmeier effect which correlates the rise time with the cycle amplitude. Using\nthe wavelet analysis, we explored different periodicities of different time\nscales present in the sunspot area times series.\n", "  Coherently scattered light from a single quantum system promises to get a\nvaluable quantum resource. In this letter an external laser field is\nefficiently coupled to a single nitrogen vacancy (NV-)center in diamond. By\nthis it is possible to detect a direct extinction signal and estimate the NV's\nextinction cross-section. The exact amount of coherent and incoherent photons\nis determined against the saturation parameter, and reveals the optimal point\nof generating coherently scattered photons and an optimal point of excitation.\nA theoretical model of spectral diffusion allows to explain the deviation to an\natom in free-space. The introduced experimental techniques are used to\ndetermine the properties of the tight focusing in an interference experiment,\nand allow for a direct determination of the Gouy-phase in a strongly focused\nbeam.\n", "  We analyze a photon transport through an 1D open waveguide side coupled to\nthe $N$-photon microwave cavity with embedded artificial two- level atom\n(qubit). The qubit state is probed by a weak signal at the fundamental\nfrequency of the waveguide. Within the formalism of projection operators and\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach we develop a one-photon approximation scheme\nto obtain the photon wavefunction which allows for the calculation of the\nprobability amplitudes of the spontaneous transitions between the levels of two\nRabi doublets in $N$- photon cavity. We obtain analytic expressions for the\ntransmission and reflection factors of the microwave signal through a\nwaveguide, which contain the information of the qubit parameters. We show that\nfor small number of cavity photons the Mollow spectrum consists of four\nspectral lines which is a direct manifestation of quantum nature of light. The\nresults obtained in the paper are of general nature and can be applied to any\ntype of qubits. The specific properties of the qubit are only encoded in the\ntwo parameters: the energy $\\Omega$ of the qubit and its coupling $\\lambda$ to\nthe cavity photons.\n", "  We investigate the effect of resonance decays on the three-particle\ncorrelator charge separation observable in search for the chiral magnetic\neffect, using a simple simulation with realistic inputs. We find that resonance\ndecays can largely account for the measured signal. We suppress the elliptic\nflow ($v_2$) background by using zero event-by-event $v_2$ (or via the\nmixed-event technique). We find that the background is suppressed, but not\neliminated as naively anticipated. We identify the reason to be the\nnon-identicalness of the resonance and final-state particle's $v_2$ and the\ninduced correlation between the transverse momentum dependent resonance $v_2$\nand decay angle. We make predictions for the charge separation signal due to\nresonance decays in 200~GeV Au+Au collisions.\n", "  Recent research suggests that the supercritical state consists of liquidlike\nand gaslike states where particle dynamics and key system properties are\nqualitatively different. We report experimental evidence of the structural\ncrossover in supercritical neon at pressure and temperature conditions\nsignificantly exceeding the critical point values: 250$\\,P_c$ and 6.6$\\,T_c$.\nThe experimental results show a crossover of the medium-range order structure\nevidenced by the change of the structure factor with pressure. We also observe\nthe crossover of the short-range order structure indicated by changes in the\ncoordination number. The relative width of the crossover is fairly narrow and\nis smaller than 10-12 \\% in pressure and temperature. By comparing our\nexperimental results with molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest that the\nobserved crossover can be attributed to the Frenkel line and discuss the\nrelationship between the structural crossover and qualitative changes of\ndynamical and thermodynamic properties of supercritical matter.\n", "  Quantum mechanics is known to provide significant improvements in information\nprocessing tasks when compared to classical models. These advantages range from\ncomputational speeds-up to security improvements. A key question is where these\nadvantages come from. The toy model developed by Spekkens [R. W. Spekkens PRA\n75, 032110 (2012)] mimics many of the features of quantum mechanics, such as\nentanglement and no-cloning, regarded as being important in this regard,\ndespite being a local hidden variable theory. In this work we study several\nprotocols within Spekkens' toy model where we see it can also mimic the\nadvantages and limitations shown in the quantum case. We first provide explicit\nproofs for the impossibility of toy bit-commitment and the existence of a toy\nerror correction protocol and consequent $k-$threshold secret sharing. Then,\ndefining a toy computational model based on the quantum one-way computer we\nprove the existence of blind and verified protocols. Importantly, these two\nlast quantum protocols are known to achieve a better-than-classical security.\nOur results suggest that such quantum improvements need not arise from any\nBell-type non locality or contextuality, but rather as a consequence of\nsteering correlations.\n", "  Oxygen-containing yttrium hydride thin films exhibit a photochromic behavior:\ntransparent thin films switch from a transparent state to a photodarkened state\nafter being illuminated with UV or blue light. This feature has attracted much\nattention in recent years due to its potential applications in smart\nfenestration or in any device in which a response to intense light radiation is\nneeded. However, the process responsible for the reversible change of the\noptical properties upon illumination is still not well understood. The\nobjective of the present work is to shed some light on the photochromic\nmechanism by using an optical approach. On this basis, the optical properties\nof oxygen-containing yttrium hydride thin films have been studied by optical\nspectrophotometry and ellipsometry before (transparent state) and after UV\nillumination (dark state). According to the observed results, the photochromic\noptical change of the films can be explained quantitatively by the gradual\ngrowth, under illumination, of metallic phases within the initial wide-band gap\nsemiconducting lattice.\n", "  We propose a tensor network encoding the set of all eigenstates of a fully\nmany-body localized system in one dimension. Our construction, conceptually\nbased on the ansatz introduced in Phys. Rev. B 94, 041116(R) (2016), is built\nfrom two layers of unitary matrices which act on blocks of $\\ell$ contiguous\nsites.\n  We argue this yields an exponential reduction in computational time and\nmemory requirement as compared to all previous approaches for finding a\nrepresentation of the complete eigenspectrum of large many-body localized\nsystems with a given accuracy. Concretely, we optimize the unitaries by\nminimizing the magnitude of the commutator of the approximate integrals of\nmotion and the Hamiltonian, which can be done in a local fashion. This further\nreduces the computational complexity of the tensor networks arising in the\nminimization process compared to previous work. We test the accuracy of our\nmethod by comparing the approximate energy spectrum to exact diagonalization\nresults for the random field Heisenberg model on 16 sites. We find that the\ntechnique is highly accurate deep in the localized regime and maintains a\nsurprising degree of accuracy in predicting certain local quantities even in\nthe vicinity of the predicted dynamical phase transition. To demonstrate the\npower of our technique, we study a system of 72 sites and we are able to see\nclear signatures of the phase transition. Our work opens a new avenue to study\nproperties of the many-body localization transition in large systems.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to further explore the usefulness of the\ntwo-dimensional complexity-entropy causality plane as a texture image\ndescriptor. A multiscale generalization is introduced in order to distinguish\nbetween different roughness features of images at small and large spatial\nscales. Numerically generated two-dimensional structures are initially\nconsidered for illustrating basic concepts in a controlled framework. Then,\nmore realistic situations are studied. Obtained results allow us to confirm\nthat intrinsic spatial correlations of images are successfully unveiled by\nimplementing this multiscale symbolic information-theory approach.\nConsequently, we conclude that the proposed representation space is a versatile\nand practical tool for identifying, characterizing and discriminating image\ntextures.\n", "  A proposed phase-estimation protocol based on measuring the parity of a\ntwo-mode squeezed-vacuum state at the output of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer\nshows that the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao sensitivity is sub-Heisenberg [Phys.\\ Rev.\\\nLett.\\ {\\bf104}, 103602 (2010)]. However, these measurements are problematic,\nmaking it unclear if this sensitivity can be obtained with a finite number of\nmeasurements. This sensitivity is only for phase near zero, and in this region\nthere is a problem with ambiguity because measurements cannot distinguish the\nsign of the phase. Here, we consider a finite number of parity measurements,\nand show that an adaptive technique gives a highly accurate phase estimate\nregardless of the phase. We show that the Heisenberg limit is reachable, where\nthe number of trials needed for mean photon number $\\bar{n}=1$ is approximately\none hundred. We show that the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao sensitivity can be achieved\napproximately, and the estimation is unambiguous in the interval ($-\\pi/2,\n\\pi/2$).\n", "  By developing the hydrodynamic theory of spinor superfluids we calculate the\nmoment of inertia of a harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate with\nspin-orbit coupling. We show that the velocity field associated with the\nrotation of the fluid exhibits diffused vorticity, in contrast to the\nirrotational behavior characterizing a superfluid. Both Raman-induced and\nRashba spin-orbit couplings are considered. In the first case the moment of\ninertia takes the rigid value at the transition between the plane wave and the\nsingle minimum phase, while in the latter case the rigid value is achieved in\nthe limit of isotropic Rashba coupling. A procedure to generate the rigid\nrotation of the fluid and to measure the moment of inertia is proposed. The\nquenching of the quantum of circulation $h/m$, caused by Raman induced\nspin-orbit coupling in a toroidal geometry, is also discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we present an accurate and robust scaling operator based on\nmaterial optical thickness (OT) for the least-squares spherical harmonics\n(LSP$_N$) method for solving neutron transport problems. LSP$_N$ without proper\nscaling is known to be erroneous in highly scattering medium, if the optical\nthickness of the material is large. A previously presented scaling developed by\nManteuffel, et al.\\ does improve the accuracy of LSP$_N$, in problems where the\nmaterial is optically thick. With the method, however, essentially no scaling\nis applied in optically thin materials, which can lead to an erroneous solution\nwith presence of highly scattering medium. Another scaling approach, called the\nreciprocal-removal (RR) scaled LSP$_N$, which is equivalent to the self-adjoint\nangular flux (SAAF) equation, has numerical issues in highly-scattering\nmaterials due to a singular weighting. We propose a scaling based on optical\nthickness that improves the solution in optically thick media while avoiding\nthe singularity in the SAAF formulation.\n", "  Controlling electric and magnetic properties of matter by laser beams is\nactively explored in the broad region of condensed matter physics, including\nspintronics and magneto-optics. Here we theoretically propose an application of\noptical and electron vortex beams carrying intrinsic orbital angular momentum\nto chiral ferro- and antiferro- magnets. We analyze the time evolution of spins\nin chiral magnets under irradiation of vortex beams, by using the stochastic\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We show that beam-driven nonuniform\ntemperature lead to a class of ring-shaped magnetic defects, what we call\nskyrmion multiplex, as well as conventional skyrmions. We discuss the proper\nbeam parameters and the optimal way of applying the beams for the creation of\nthese topological defects. Our findings provide an ultrafast scheme of\ngenerating topological magnetic defects in a way applicable to both metallic\nand insulating chiral (anti-) ferromagnets.\n", "  This is a work in two parts in which we show how to solve a large class of\nLindblad master equations for non-interacting particles on $L$ sites. In part I\nwe concentrate on bosonic particles. We show how to reduce the problem to\ndiagonalizing an $L \\times L$ non-Hermitian matrix. In particular, for boundary\ndissipative driving of a uniform chain, the matrix is a tridiagonal bordered\nToeplitz matrix which can be solved analytically for the normal master modes\nand their relaxation rates (rapidities). In the regimes in which an analytical\nsolution cannot be found, our approach can still provide a speed-up in the\nnumerical evaluation. We use this numerical method to study the relaxation gap\nat non-equilibrium phase transitions in a boundary driven bosonic ladder with\nsynthetic gauge fields. We conclude by showing how to construct the\nnon-equilibrium steady state.\n", "  In this paper we consider (2+1)-dimensional SU(N)-symmetric gauge theory\nwithin light front perturbation theory, regularized by the method analogous to\nPauli-Villars regularization. This enables us to construct correct renormalized\nlight front Hamiltonian.\n", "  We study the implementation of quantum channels with quantum computers while\nminimizing the experimental cost, measured in terms of the number of\nControlled-NOT (C-NOT) gates required (single-qubit gates are free). We\nconsider three different models. In the first, the Quantum Circuit Model (QCM),\nwe consider sequences of single-qubit and C-NOT gates and allow qubits to be\ntraced out at the end of the gate sequence. In the second (RandomQCM), we also\nallow external classical randomness. In the third (MeasuredQCM) we also allow\nmeasurements followed by operations that are classically controlled on the\noutcomes. We prove lower bounds on the number of C-NOT gates required and give\nnear-optimal decompositions in almost all cases. Our main result is a\nMeasuredQCM circuit for any channel from m qubits to n qubits that uses at most\none ancilla and has a low C-NOT count. We give explicit examples for small\nnumbers of qubits that provide the lowest known C-NOT counts.\n", "  In the weak field regime, gravitational waves can be considered as being made\nup of collisionless, relativistic tensor modes that travel along null geodesics\nof the perturbed background metric. We work in this geometric optics picture to\ncalculate the anisotropies in gravitational wave backgrounds resulting from\nastrophysical and cosmological sources. Our formalism yields expressions for\nthe angular power spectrum of the anisotropies. We show how the anisotropies\nare sourced by intrinsic, Doppler, Sachs-Wolfe, and Integrated Sachs-Wolfe\nterms in analogy with Cosmic Microwave Background photons.\n", "  In this work we show that a relativistic spinning particle can be described\nat the classical and the quantum level as being composed of two physical\nconstituents which are entangled and separated by a fixed distance. This\nbilocal model for spinning particles allows for a natural description of\nparticle interactions as a local interaction at each of the constituents. This\nform of the interaction vertex provides a resolution to a long standing issue\non the nature of relativistic interactions for spinning objects in the context\nof the worldline formalism. It also potentially brings a dynamical explanation\nfor why massive fundamental objects are naturally of lowest spin. We analyze\nfirst a non-relativistic system where spin is modeled as an entangled state of\ntwo particles with the entanglement encoded into a set of constraints. It is\nshown that these constraints can be made relativistic and that the resulting\ndescription is isomorphic to the usual description of the phase space of\nmassive relativistic particles with the restriction that the quantum spin has\nto be an integer.\n", "  There is considerable long-term interest in understanding the dynamics of\ncollaboration networks, and how these networks form and evolve over time. Most\nof the work done on the dynamics of social networks focuses on well-established\ncommunities. Work examining emerging social networks is rarer, simply because\ndata is difficult to obtain in real time. In this paper, we use thirty years of\ndata from an emerging scientific community to look at that crucial early stage\nin the development of a social network. We show that when the field was very\nyoung, islands of individual researchers labored in relative isolation, and the\ncoauthorship network was disconnected. Thirty years later, rather than a\ncluster of individuals, we find a true collaborative community, bound together\nby a robust collaboration network. However, this change did not take place\ngradually\\textemdash the network remained a loose assortment of isolated\nindividuals until the mid-2000s, when those smaller parts suddenly knit\nthemselves together into a single whole. In the rest of this paper, we consider\nthe role of three factors in these observed structural changes: growth, changes\nin social norms, and the introduction of institutions such as field-specific\nconferences and journals. We have data from the very earliest years of the\nfield, a period which includes the introduction of two different institutions:\nthe first field-specific conference, and the first field-specific journals. We\nalso identify two relevant behavioral shifts: a discrete increase in\ncoauthorship coincident with the first conference, and a shift among\nestablished authors away from collaborating with outsiders, towards\ncollaborating with each other. The interaction of these factors gives us\ninsight into the formation of collaboration networks more broadly.\n", "  Using the latest AMS-02 cosmic ray antiproton flux data, we search for\npotential dark matter annihilation signal. The background parameters about the\npropagation, source injection, and solar modulation are not assumed {\\it a\npriori}, but based on the results inferred from the recent B/C ratio and proton\ndata measurements instead. The possible dark matter signal is incorporated into\nthe model self-consistently under a Bayesian framework. Compared with the\nastrophysical background only hypothesis, we find that a dark matter signal is\nfavored. The rest mass of the dark matter particles is $\\sim 20-80$ GeV and the\nvelocity-averaged hadronic annihilation cross section is about $(0.2-5)\\times\n10^{-26}$ cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$, in agreement with that needed to account for the\nGalactic center GeV excess and/or the weak GeV emission from dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies Reticulum 2 and Tucana III. Tight constraints on the dark matter\nannihilation models are also set in a wide mass region.\n", "  Differential and double-differential cross sections for the production of top\nquark pairs in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV are measured as a function of\njet multiplicity and of kinematic variables of the top quarks and the top\nquark-antiquark system. This analysis is based on data collected by the CMS\nexperiment at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse\nfemtobarns. The measurements are performed in the lepton+jets decay channels\nwith a single muon or electron in the final state. The differential cross\nsections are presented at particle level, within a phase space close to the\nexperimental acceptance, and at parton level in the full phase space. The\nresults are compared to several standard model predictions.\n", "  Chained correlation inequalities involving pairwise correlations of qubit\nobservables in the equatorial plane are constructed based on the positivity of\na sequence of moment matrices. When a jointly measurable set of fuzzy POVMs is\nemployed in first measurement of every pair of sequential measurements, the\nchained pairwise correlations do not violate the classical bound imposed by the\nmoment matrix positivity. We identify that incompatibility of measurements is\nonly necessary, but not sufficient, in general, for the violation of the\ninequality. On the other hand, there exists a one-to-one equivalence between\nthe degree of incompatibility (which quantifies the joint measurability) of the\nequatorial qubit observables and the optimal violation of a non-local steering\ninequality, proposed by Jones and Wiseman (Phys. Rev. A, 84, 012110 (2011)). To\nthis end, we construct a local analogue of this steering inequality in a single\nqubit system and show that its violation is a mere reflection of measurement\nincompatibility of equatorial qubit POVMs, employed in first measurements in\nthe sequential unsharp-sharp scheme.\n", "  Interfacing superconductors with strongly spin-polarized magnetic materials\nopens the possibility to discover new spintronic devices in which spin-triplet\nCooper pairs play a key role. Motivated by the recent derivation of\nspin-polarized quasiclassical boundary conditions capable of describing such a\nscenario in the diffusive limit, we consider the emergent physics in hybrid\nstructures comprised of a conventional s-wave superconductor (e.g. Nb, Al) and\neither strongly spin-polarized ferromagnetic insulators (e.g. EuO, GdN) or\nhalfmetallic ferromagnets (e.g. CrO2, LCMO). In contrast to most previous\nworks, we focus on how the superconductor itself is influenced by the proximity\neffect, and how the generated triplet Cooper pairs manifest themselves in the\nself-consistently computed density of states (DOS) and the superconducting\ncritical temperature Tc. We provide a comprehensive treatment of how the\nsuperconductor and its properties are affected by the triplet pairs,\ndemonstrating that our theory can reproduce the recent observation of an\nunusually large zero-energy peak in a superconductor interfaced with a\nhalf-metal, which even exceeds the normal-state DOS. We also discuss the recent\nobservation of a large superconducting spin-valve effect with a Tc change ~1K\nin superconductor/half-metal structures, in which case our results indicate\nthat the experiment cannot be explained fully by a long-ranged triplet\nproximity effect.\n", "  Dynamical systems may host a number of remarkable symmetry-protected phases\nthat are qualitatively different from their static analogs. In this work, we\nconsider the phase space of symmetry-respecting unitary evolutions in detail\nand identify several distinct classes of evolution that host novel dynamical\norder. Using ideas from group cohomology, we construct a set of interacting\nFloquet drives that generate dynamical symmetry-protected topological order for\neach nontrivial cohomology class in every dimension, illustrating our\nconstruction with explicit two-dimensional examples. We also identify a set of\nsymmetry-protected Floquet drives that lie outside of the group cohomology\nconstruction, and a further class of symmetry-respecting topological drives\nwhich host chiral edge modes. We use these special drives to define a notion of\nphase (stable to a class of local perturbations in the bulk) and the concepts\nof relative and absolute topological order, which can be applied to many\ndifferent classes of unitary evolutions. These include fully many-body\nlocalized unitary evolutions and time crystals.\n", "  The Sturm oscillation property, i.e. that the $n$-th eigenfunction of a\nSturm-Liouville operator on an interval has $n -1$ zeros (nodes), has been well\nstudied. This result is known to hold when the interval is replaced by a metric\n(quantum) tree graph. We prove that the solutions of the real stationary\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation on an interval satisfy a nonlinear version of\nthe Sturm oscillation property. However, we show that unlike the linear theory,\nthe nonlinear version of the Sturm oscillation breaks down already for a star\ngraph. We point out conditions under which this violation can be assured.\n", "  Motivated by the normal state of the cuprates in which the f-sum rule\nincreases faster than a linear function of the particle density, we derive a\nconductivity sum rule for a system in which the kinetic energy operator in the\nHamiltonian is a general function of the momentum squared. Such a kinetic\nenergy arises in scale invariant theories and can be derived within the context\nof holography. Our derivation of the f-sum rule is based on the gauge couplings\nof a non-local Lagrangian in which the kinetic operator is a fractional\nLaplacian of order $\\alpha$. We find that the f-sum rule in this case deviates\nfrom the standard linear dependence on the particle density. We find two\nregimes. At high temperatures and low densities, the sum rule is proportional\nto $nT^{\\frac{\\alpha-1}{\\alpha}}$ where $T$ is the temperature. At low\ntemperatures and high densities, the sum rule is proportional to\n$n^{1+\\frac{2(\\alpha-1)}{d}}$ with $d$ being the number of spatial dimensions.\nThe result in the low temperature and high density limit, when $\\alpha < 1$,\ncan be used to qualitatively explain the behavior of the effective number of\ncharge carriers in the cuprates at various doping concentrations.\n", "  We describe an ab-initio disordered local moment theory for long period\nmagnetic phases and investigate the temperature and magnetic field dependence\nof the magnetic states in the heavy rare earth elements (HRE), namely\nparamagnetic, conical and helical anti-ferromagnetic(HAFM), fan and\nferromagnetic (FM) states. We obtain a generic HRE magnetic phase diagram which\nis consequent on the response of the common HRE valence electronic structure to\nf-electron magnetic moment ordering. The theory directly links the first order\nHAFM-FM transition to the loss of Fermi surface nesting as well as providing a\ntemplate for analysing the other phases and exposing where f-electron\ncorrelation effects are particularly intricate. Gadolinium, for a range of\nhexagonal, close-packed lattice constants, c and a, is the prototype and\napplications to other HREs are made straightforwardly by scaling the pair and\nquartic local moment interactions with de Gennes factors and choosing\nappropriate lanthanide contracted c and $a$ values.\n", "  The band gaps of a few selected semiconductors/insulators are obtained from\nthe self-consistent solution of the Hedin's equations. Two different schemes to\ninclude the vertex corrections are studied: (i) the vertex function of the\nfirst-order (in the screened interaction $W$) is applied in both the\npolarizability $P$ and the self-energy $\\Sigma$, and (ii) the vertex function\nobtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation is used in $P$ whereas the vertex of\nthe first-order is used in $\\Sigma$. Both schemes show considerable improvement\nin the accuracy of the calculated band gaps as compared to the self-consistent\n$GW$ approach (sc$GW$) and to the self-consistent quasi-particle $GW$ approach\n(QS$GW$). To further distinguish between the performances of two\nvertex-corrected schemes one has to properly take into account the effect of\nthe electron-phonon interaction on the calculated band gaps which appears to be\nof the same magnitude as the difference between schemes i) and ii).\n", "  A linear Josephson junction mediated by the surface states of a\ntime-reversal-invariant Weyl or Dirac semimetal localizes Majorana flat bands\nprotected by the time-reversal symmetry. We show that as a result, the\nJosephson current exhibits a discontinuous jump at $\\pi$ phase difference which\ncan serve as an experimental signature of the Majorana bands. The magnitude of\nthe jump scales proportionally to the junction width and the momentum space\ndistance between the Weyl nodes. It also exhibits a characteristic dependence\non the junction orientation. We demonstrate that the jump is robust against the\neffects of non-zero temperature and weak non-magnetic disorder.\n", "  The work distribution is a fundamental quantity in nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics mainly due to its connection with fluctuations theorems. Here we\ndevelop a semiclassical approximation to the work distribution for a quench\nprocess in chaotic systems. The approach is based on the dephasing\nrepresentation of the quantum Loschmidt echo and on the quantum ergodic\nconjecture, which states that the Wigner function of a typical eigenstate of a\nclassically chaotic Hamiltonian is equidistributed on the energy shell. We show\nthat our semiclassical approximation is accurate in describing the quantum\ndistribution as we increase the temperature. Moreover, we also show that this\nsemiclassical approximation provides a link between the quantum and classical\nwork distributions.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the $d^4$ (Cr$^{2+}$) compound BaCr$_2$As$_2$\nand show that, despite non-negligible differences in the electronic structure,\nits many-body physics mirrors that of BaFe$_2$As$_2$, which has instead a $d^6$\n(Fe$^{2+}$) configuration. This reflects a symmetry of the electron correlation\neffects around the half-filled $d^5$ Mott insulating state. The experimentally\nknown metallic antiferromagnetic phase is correctly modeled by dynamical\nmean-field theory, and for realistic values of the interaction it shows a\nmoderate mass enhancement of order $\\sim$2. This value decreases if the ordered\nmoment grows as a result of a stronger interaction. The antiferromagnetic phase\ndiagram for this $d^4$ shows similarities with that calculated for the $d^6$\nsystems. Correspondingly, in the paramagnetic phase the influence of the\nhalf-filled Mott insulator shows up as a crossover from a weakly correlated to\nan orbitally differentiated \"Hund's metal\" phase which reflects an analogous\nphenomenon in $d^6$ iron compounds including a strong enhancement of the\ncompressibility in a zone just inside the frontier between the normal and the\nHund's metal. The experimental evidence and our theoretical description place\nBaCr$_2$As$_2$ at interaction strength slightly below the crossover which\nimplies that negative pressures and/or electron doping (e.g. Cr $\\rightarrow$\nMn,Fe or Ba $\\rightarrow$ Sc,Y,La) might strongly enhance the compressibility,\nthereby possibly inducing a pairing instability in this non-superconducting\ncompound.\n", "  A framework is presented for including second-order perturbative corrections\nto the radiation patterns of parton showers. The formalism allows to combine\nO(alphaS^2)-corrected iterated 2->3 kernels for \"ordered\" gluon emissions with\ntree-level 2->4 kernels for \"unordered\" ones. The combined Sudakov evolution\nkernel is thus accurate to O(alphaS^2). As a first step towards a full-fledged\nimplementation of these ideas, we develop an explicit implementation of 2->4\nshower branchings in this letter.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of a bistable phase in an open many-body\nsystem. To this end we discuss the microscopic dynamics of a continuously\noff-resonantly driven Rydberg lattice gas in the regime of strong decoherence.\nOur experimental results reveal a prolongation of the temporal correlations\nwith respect to the lifetime of a single Rydberg excitation and show strong\nevidence for the formation of finite-sized Rydberg excitation clusters in the\nsteady state. We simulate our data using a simplified and a full many-body\nrate-equation model. The results are compatible with the formation of\nmetastable states associated with a bimodal counting distribution as well as\ndynamic hysteresis. A scaling analysis reveals however, that the correlation\ntimes remain finite for all relevant system parameters. This suggest that the\nRydberg aggregate is composed of many small clusters and all correlation\nlengths remain finite. This is a strong indication for the absence of a global\nbistable phase, previously suggested to exist in this system.\n", "  We present a unified theory to treat conservation laws in light-matter\ninteractions. It can be used to describe and engineer the transfer of any\nmeasurable property from the electromagnetic field to any object. The theory\nallows to explicitly characterize and separately compute the transfer due to\nasymmetry of the object and the transfer due to field absorption by the object.\nIt also allows to compute the upper bound of the transfer rate of any given\nproperty to any given object, together with the corresponding most efficient\nillumination which achieves the bound. Due to its algebraic nature, the\napproach is inherently suited for computer implementation.\n", "  The relative modification of the prompt psi(2S) and J/psi yields from pp to\nPbPb collisions, at the center of mass energy of 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair, is\npresented. The analysis is based on pp and PbPb data samples collected by the\nCMS experiment at the LHC in 2015, corresponding to integrated luminosities of\n28.0 inverse picobarns and 464 inverse microbarns, respectively. The double\nratio of measured yields of prompt charmonia reconstructed through their decays\ninto muon pairs, (N[psi(2S)]/N[J/psi])[PbPb] / (N[psi(2S)]/N[J/psi])[pp], is\ndetermined as a function of PbPb collision centrality and charmonium transverse\nmomentum pt, in two kinematic intervals: abs(y) < 1.6 covering 6.5 < pt < 30\nGeV/c and 1.6 < abs(y) < 2.4 covering 3 < pt < 30 GeV/c. The\ncentrality-integrated double ratios are 0.36 +/- 0.08 (stat) +/-0.05 (syst) in\nthe first interval and 0.24 +/- 0.22 (stat) +/- 0.09 (syst) in the second. The\ndouble ratio is lower than unity in all the measured bins, suggesting that the\npsi(2S) yield is more suppressed than the J/psi yield in the explored phase\nspace.\n", "  The relation of topological insulators and superconductors and the field of\nnonlinear dynamics is widely unexplored. To address this subject, we adopt the\nlinear coupling geometry of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, a paradigmatic\nexample for a topological insulator, and render it nonlinearly in the context\nof superconducting circuits. As a consequence, the system exhibits\ntopologically-enforced bifurcations as a function of the topological control\nparameter, which finally gives rise to chaotic dynamics, separating phases\nwhich exhibit clear topological features.\n", "  A canonical analysis for general relativity is performed on a null surface\nwithout fixing the diffeomorphism gauge, and the canonical pairs of\nconfiguration and momentum variables are derived. Next to the well-known spin-2\npair, also spin-1 and spin-0 pairs are identified. The boundary action for a\nnull boundary segment of spacetime is obtained, including terms on codimension\ntwo corners.\n", "  We study analytically and numerically the interaction potentials between a\npair of quark an anti-quark on D3, M2 and M5 branes. These potentials are\nobtained using Maldacena's method involving Wilson loops and present confining\nand non-confining behaviours in different situations that we explore in this\nwork. In particular, at the near horizon geometry the potentials are\nnon-confining in agreement with conformal field theory expectations. On the\nother side, far from horizon, the dual field theories are no longer conformal\nand the potentials present confinement. This is in agreement with the behaviour\nof strings in flat space where the string mimics the expected flux tube of QCD.\nA study of the transition between the confining/non-confining regimes in the\nthree different scenarios (D3, M2, M5) is also performed.\n", "  We show that the previously predicted Fermion particle that has no analogue\nin the standard model of particle theory - the cubically dispersed Dirac\nsemimetal (CDSM) - is realized in a specific, stable solid state system that\nhas been made years ago, but was not appreciated to host such a unique Fermion,\ncomposed of six Weyl Fermions, 3 with left-handed and 3 with right-handed\nchirality. We identified the crystal symmetry constraints and found the space\ngroup P63/m as one of the two that can support a CDSM, of which the\ncharacteristic band crossing has linear dispersion along the principle axis but\ncubic dispersion in the plane perpendicular to it. We then conducted a material\nsearch using density functional theory identifying a group of\nquasi-one-dimensional molybdenum mono-chalcogenide compounds A(MoX)3 (A = Na,\nK, Rb, In, Tl, X = S, Se, Te) as ideal CDSM candidates. Studying the stability\nof the A(MoX)3 family reveals a few candidates such as Rb(MoTe)3 and Tl(MoTe)3\nthat are predicted to be resilient to Peierls distortion, thus retaining the\nmetallic character. The combination of one-dimensionality and metallic nature\nin this family provides a platform for unusual optical signature - polarization\ndependent metallic vs insulating response.\n", "  Similar to nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and impurity atoms in silicon,\ninterstitial gallium deep paramagnetic centers in GaAsN have been proven to\nhave useful characteristics for the development of spintronic devices. Among\nother interesting properties, under circularly polarized light, gallium centers\nin GaAsN act as spin filters that dynamically polarize free and bound electrons\nreaching record spin polarizations (100\\%). Furthermore, the recent observation\nof the amplification of the spin filtering effect under a Faraday configuration\nmagnetic field has suggested that the hyperfine interaction that couples bound\nelectrons and nuclei permits the optical manipulation of its nuclear spin\npolarization. Even though the mechanisms behind the nuclear spin polarization\nin gallium centers are fairly well understood, the origin of nuclear spin\nrelaxation and the formation of an Overhauser-like magnetic field remain\nelusive. In this work we develop a model based on the master equation approach\nto describe the evolution of electronic and nuclear spin polarizations of\ngallium centers interacting with free electrons and holes. Our results are in\ngood agreement with existing experimental observations. In regard to the\nnuclear spin relaxation, the roles of nuclear dipolar and quadrupolar\ninteractions are discussed. Our findings show that, besides the hyperfine\ninteraction, the spin relaxation mechanisms are key to understand the\namplification of the spin filtering effect and the appearance of the\nOverhauser-like magnetic field. Based on our model's results we propose an\nexperimental protocol based on time resolved spectroscopy. It consists of a\npump-probe photoluminescence scheme that would allow the detection and the\ntracing of the electron-nucleus flip-flops through time resolved PL\nmeasurements.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the lifetime of optical spectral holes due to\npopulation storage in Zeeman sublevels of Nd$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$. The lifetime\nis measured as a function of magnetic field strength and orientation,\ntemperature and Nd$^{3+}$ doping concentration. At the lowest temperature of 3\nK we find a general trend where the lifetime is short at low field strengths,\nthen increases to a maximum lifetime at a few hundreds of mT, and then finally\ndecays rapidly for high field strengths. This behaviour can be modelled with a\nrelaxation rate dominated by Nd$^{3+}$-Nd$^{3+}$ cross relaxation at low fields\nand spin lattice relaxation at high magnetic fields. The maximum lifetime\ndepends strongly on both the field strength and orientation, due to the\ncompetition between these processes and their different angular dependencies.\nThe cross relaxation limits the maximum lifetime for concentrations as low as\n30 ppm of Nd$^{3+}$ ions. By decreasing the concentration to less than 1 ppm we\ncould completely eliminate the cross relaxation, reaching a lifetime of 3.8 s\nat 3~K. At higher temperatures the spectral hole lifetime is limited by the\nmagnetic-field independent Raman and Orbach processes. In addition we show that\nthe cross relaxation rate can be strongly reduced by creating spectrally large\nholes of the order of the optical inhomogeneous broadening. Our results are\nimportant for the development and design of new rare-earth-ion doped crystals\nfor quantum information processing and narrow-band spectral filtering for\nbiological tissue imaging.\n", "  The Principle of Maximal Conformality (PMC) provides a systematic way to set\nthe renormalization scales order-by-order for any perturbative QCD process. The\nresulting predictions are independent of the choice of renormalization scheme,\na requirement of renormalization group invariance. The Crewther relation, which\nwas originally derived for conformal theory, provides a remarkable connection\nbetween two observables when the $\\beta$ function vanishes. The \"Generalized\nCrewther Relation\" relates these two observables for physical QCD with nonzero\n$\\beta$ function; specifically, it connects the non-singlet Adler function\n($D^{\\rm ns}$) to the Bjorken sum rule coefficient for polarized deep-inelastic\nelectron scattering ($C_{\\rm Bjp}$) at leading twist. A scheme-dependent\n$\\Delta_{\\rm CSB}$-term appears in the analysis in order to compensate for the\nconformal symmetry breaking (CSB) terms from perturbative QCD. In conventional\nanalyses, this normally leads to unphysical dependence in both the choice of\nthe renormalization scheme and the choice of the initial scale at any finite\norder. However, by applying PMC scale-setting, we can fix the scales of the QCD\ncoupling unambiguously at every order of pQCD. ...... Thus one obtains a new\ngeneralized Crewther relation for QCD which connects two effective charges,\n$\\widehat{\\alpha}_d(Q)= \\sum_{i\\geq1} \\widehat{\\alpha}^{i}_{g_1}(Q_i)$, at\ntheir respective physical scales. This identity is independent of the choice of\nthe renormalization scheme at any finite order, and the dependence on the\nchoice of the initial scale is negligible. Similar scale-fixed commensurate\nscale relations also connect other physical observables at their physical\nmomentum scales, thus providing convention-independent, fundamental precision\ntests of QCD.\n", "  We analyse the kinematics of cosmological spacetimes with nonzero torsion, in\nthe framework of the classical Einstein-Cartan gravity. After a brief\nintroduction to the basic features of spaces with non-vanishing torsion, we\nconsider a family of observers moving along timelike worldlines and focus on\ntheir kinematic behaviour. In so doing, we isolate the irreducible variables\nmonitoring the observers' motion and derive their evolution formulae and\nassociated constraint equations. Our aim is to identify the effects of\nspacetime torsion, and the changes they introduce into the kinematics of the\nstandard, torsion-free, cosmological models. We employ a fully geometrical\napproach, imposing no restrictions on the material content, or any a priori\ncouplings between torsion and spin. Also, we do not apply the familiar\nsplitting of the equations, into a purely Riemannian component plus a\ntorsion/spin part, at the start of our study, but only introduce it at the very\nend. With the general formulae at hand, we use the Einstein-Cartan field\nequations to incorporate explicitly the spin of the matter. The resulting\nformulae fully describe the kinematics of dynamical spacetimes within the\nframework of the Einstein-Cartan gravity, while in the special case of the\nso-called Weyssenhoff fluid, they recover results previously reported in the\nliterature.\n", "  We generalize the string-net construction to multiple flavors of strings,\neach of which is labeled by the elements of an abelian group $G_i$. The same\nflavor of strings can branch while different flavors of strings can cross one\nanother and thus they form intersecting string-nets. We systematically\nconstruct the exactly soluble lattice Hamiltonians and the ground state wave\nfunctions for the intersecting string-net condensed phases. We analyze the\nbraiding statistics of the low energy quasiparticle excitations and find that\nour model can realize all the topological phases as the string-net model with\ngroup $G=\\prod_i G_i$. In this respect, our construction suggests several ways\nof building lattice models which realize topological order $G$. They correspond\nto intersecting string-net models with various choices of flavors of strings\nassociated with different decomposition of $G$. In fact, our construction\nconcretely demonstrates the K\\text{\\\"u}nneth formula by constructing various\nlattice models with the same topological order. As an example, we construct the\n$G=\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 $ string-net model which\nrealizes a non-abelian topological phase by properly intersecting three copies\nof toric codes.\n", "  We analyze the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified particles\n($\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, $p$, and $\\bar p$) produced in gold-gold (Au-Au) and\nlead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions over a $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ (center-of-mass energy per\nnucleon pair) range from 14.5 GeV [one of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider\n(RHIC) energies] to 2.76 TeV [one of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies].\nFor the spectra with a narrow $p_T$ range, an improved Tsallis distribution\nwhich is in fact the Tsallis distribution with radial flow is used. For the\nspectra with a wide $p_T$ range, a superposition of the improved Tsallis\ndistribution and an inverse power-law is used. Both the extracted kinetic\nfreeze-out temperature ($T_0$) and radial flow velocity ($\\beta_T$) increase\nwith the increase of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, which indicates a higher excitation and\nlarger expansion of the interesting system at the LHC. Both the values of $T_0$\nand $\\beta_T$ in central collisions are slightly larger than those in\nperipheral collisions, and they are independent of isospin and slightly\ndependent on mass.\n", "  We use the long-wavelength formalism to investigate the level of bispectral\nnon-Gaussianity produced in two-field inflation models with standard kinetic\nterms. Even though the Planck satellite has so far not detected any primordial\nnon-Gaussianity, it has tightened the constraints significantly, and it is\nimportant to better understand what regions of inflation model space have been\nruled out, as well as prepare for the next generation of experiments that might\nreach the important milestone of Delta f_NL(local) = 1. We derive an\nalternative formulation of the previously derived integral expression for f_NL,\nwhich makes it easier to physically interpret the result and see which types of\npotentials can produce large non-Gaussianity. We apply this to the case of a\nsum potential and show that it is very difficult to satisfy simultaneously the\nconditions for a large f_NL and the observational constraints on the spectral\nindex n_s. In the case of the sum of two monomial potentials and a constant we\nexplicitly show in which small region of parameter space this is possible, and\nwe show how to construct such a model. Finally, the new general expression for\nf_NL also allows us to prove that for the sum potential the explicit\nexpressions derived within the slow-roll approximation remain valid even when\nthe slow-roll approximation is broken during the turn of the field trajectory\n(as long as only the epsilon slow-roll parameter remains small).\n", "  We show that the bulk winding number characterizing one-dimensional\ntopological insulators with chiral symmetry can be detected from the\ndisplacement of a single particle, observed via losses. Losses represent the\neffect of repeated weak measurements on one sublattice only, which interrupt\nthe dynamics periodically. When these do not detect the particle, they realize\nnegative measurements. Our repeated measurement scheme covers both\ntime-independent and periodically driven (Floquet) topological insulators, with\nor without spatial disorder. In the limit of rapidly repeated, vanishingly weak\nmeasurements, our scheme describes non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, as the lossy\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model of Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 065703 (2009). We find,\ncontrary to intuition, that the time needed to detect the winding number can be\nmade shorter by decreasing the efficiency of the measurement. We illustrate our\nresults on a discrete-time quantum walk, and propose ways of testing them\nexperimentally.\n", "  Within the framework of the dinuclear system model, production cross sections\nof proton-rich nuclei with charged numbers of Z=84-90 are investigated\nsystematically. Possible combinations with the $^{28}$Si, $^{32}$S, $^{40}$Ar\nbombarding the target nuclides $^{165}$Ho, $^{169}$Tm, $^{170-174}$Yb,\n$^{175,176}$Lu, $^{174,176-180}$Hf and $^{181}$Ta are analyzed thoroughly. The\noptimal excitation energies and evaporation channels are proposed to produce\nthe proton-rich nuclei. The systems are feasible to be constructed in\nexperiments. It is found that the neutron shell closure of N=126 is of\nimportance during the evaporation of neutrons. The experimental excitation\nfunctions in the $^{40}$Ar induced reactions can be nicely reproduced. The\ncharged particle evaporation is comparable with neutrons in cooling the excited\nproton-rich nuclei, in particular for the channels with $\\alpha$ and proton\nevaporation. The production cross section increases with the mass asymmetry of\ncolliding systems because of the decrease of the inner fusion barrier. The\nchannels with pure neutron evaporation depend on the isotopic targets. But it\nis different for the channels with charged particles and more sensitive to the\nodd-even effect.\n", "  We analyze the power counting of the peripheral singlet partial waves in\nnucleon-nucleon scattering. In agreement with conventional wisdom, we find that\npion exchanges are perturbative in the peripheral singlets. We quantify from\nthe effective field theory perspective the well-known suppression induced by\nthe centrifugal barrier in the pion-exchange interactions. By exploring\nperturbation theory up to fourth order, we find that the one-pion-exchange\npotential in these channels is demoted from leading to subleading order by a\ngiven power of the expansion parameter that grows with the orbital angular\nmomentum. We discuss the implications of these demotions for few-body\ncalculations: though higher partial waves have been known for a long time to be\nirrelevant in these calculations (and are hence ignored), here we explain how\nto systematize the procedure in a way that is compatible with the effective\nfield theory expansion.\n", "  We investigate the spin-transfer torque in a magnetic multilayer structure by\nmeans of a spin-diffusion model. The torque in the considered system,\nconsisting of two magnetic layers separated by a conducting layer, is caused by\na perpendicular-to-plane current. We compute the strength of the field-like and\nthe damping-like torque for different material parameters and geometries. Our\nstudies suggest that the field-like torque highly depends on the exchange\ncoupling strength of the itinerant electrons with the magnetization both in the\npinned and the free layer. While a low coupling leads to very high field-like\ntorques, a high coupling leads to low or even negative field-like torques. The\ndependence of the different torque terms on system parameters is considered\nvery important for the development of applications such as STT MRAM and\nspin-torque oscillators.\n", "  Working within the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation to General Relativity,\nwe use the effective field theory (EFT) framework to study the conservative\ndynamics of the two-body motion at fourth PN order, at fifth order in the\nNewton constant. This is one of the missing pieces preventing the computation\nof the full Lagrangian at fourth PN order using EFT methods. We exploit the\nanalogy between diagrams in the EFT gravitational theory and 2-point functions\nin massless gauge theory, to address the calculation of 4-loop amplitudes by\nmeans of standard multi-loop diagrammatic techniques. For those terms which can\nbe directly compared, our result confirms the findings of previous studies,\nperformed using different methods.\n", "  $^{75}$As Nuclear Magnetic (NMR) and Quadrupolar (NQR) Resonance were used,\ntogether with M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy, to investigate the magnetic state\ninduced by Mn for Fe substitutions in F-doped LaFe$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$AsO\nsuperconductors. The results show that $0.5$% of Mn doping is enough to\nsuppress the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ from 27 K to zero and\nto recover the magnetic structure observed in the parent undoped LaFeAsO. Also\nthe tetragonal to orthorhombic transition of the parent compound is recovered\nby introducing Mn, as evidenced by a sharp drop of the NQR frequency. The NQR\nspectra also show that a charge localization process is at play in the system.\nTheoretical calculations using a realistic five-band model show that\ncorrelation-enhanced RKKY exchange interactions between nearby Mn ions\nstabilize the observed magnetic order, dominated by $Q_1=(\\pi,0)$ and\n$Q_2=(0,\\pi)$ ordering vectors. These results give compelling evidence that\nF-doped LaFeAsO is a strongly correlated electron system at the verge of an\nelectronic instability.\n", "  We investigate the quantum dynamics of a single transmon qubit coupled to\nsurface acoustic waves (SAWs) via two distant connection points. Since the\nacoustic speed is five orders of magnitude slower than the speed of light, the\ntravelling time between the two connection points needs to be taken into\naccount. Therefore, we treat the transmon qubit as a giant atom with a\ndeterministic time delay. We find that the spontaneous emission of the system,\nformed by the giant atom and the SAWs between its connection points, initially\ndecays polynomially in the form of pulses instead of a continuous exponential\ndecay behaviour, as would be the case for a small atom. We obtain exact\nanalytical results for the scattering properties of the giant atom up to\ntwo-phonon processes by using a diagrammatic approach. We find that two peaks\nappear in the inelastic (incoherent) power spectrum of the giant atom, a\nphenomenon which does not exist for a small atom. The time delay also gives\nrise to novel features in the reflectance, transmittance, and second-order\ncorrelation functions of the system. Furthermore, we find the short-time\ndynamics of the giant atom for arbitrary drive strength by a numerically exact\nmethod for open quantum systems with a finite-time-delay feedback loop.\n", "  We perform a detailed comparison between the Logotropic model [P.H. Chavanis,\nEur. Phys. J. Plus 130 (2015) 130] and the $\\Lambda$CDM model. These two models\nbehave similarly at large (cosmological) scales up to the present. Differences\nwill appear only in the far future, in about $25\\, {\\rm Gyrs}$, when the\nLogotropic Universe becomes phantom while the $\\Lambda$CDM Universe enters in\nthe de Sitter era. However, the Logotropic model differs from the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel at small (galactic) scales, where the latter encounters serious problems.\nHaving a nonvanishing pressure, the Logotropic model can solve the cusp problem\nand the missing satellite problem of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. In addition, it\nleads to dark matter halos with a constant surface density $\\Sigma_0=\\rho_0\nr_h$, and can explain its observed value $\\Sigma_0=141 \\, M_{\\odot}/{\\rm pc}^2$\nwithout adjustable parameter. This makes the logotropic model rather unique\namong all the models attempting to unify dark matter and dark energy. In this\npaper, we compare the Logotropic and $\\Lambda$CDM models at the cosmological\nscale where they are very close to each other in order to determine\nquantitatively how much they differ. This comparison is facilitated by the fact\nthat these models depend on only two parameters, the Hubble constant $H_0$ and\nthe present fraction of dark matter $\\Omega_{\\rm m0}$. Using the latest\nobservational data from Planck 2015+Lensing+BAO+JLA+HST, we find that the best\nfit values of $H_0$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm m0}$ are $H_0=68.30\\, {\\rm km}\\, {\\rm\ns}^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm m0}=0.3014$ for the Logotropic model,\nand $H_0=68.02\\, {\\rm km}\\, {\\rm s}^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm\nm0}=0.3049$ for the $\\Lambda$CDM model. The difference between the two models\nappears at the percent level.\n", "  By exploiting the similarity between Bloch's theorem for electrons in\ncrystalline solids and the problem of Landau gauge-fixing in Yang-Mills theory\non a \"replicated\" lattice, one is able to obtain essentially infinite-volume\nresults from numerical simulations performed on a relatively small lattice.\nThis approach, proposed by D. Zwanziger in \\cite{Zwanziger:1993dh}, corresponds\nto taking the infinite-volume limit for Landau-gauge field configurations in\ntwo steps: firstly for the gauge transformation alone, while keeping the\nlattice volume finite, and secondly for the gauge-field configuration itself.\nThe solutions to the gauge-fixing condition are then given in terms of Bloch\nwaves. Applying the method to data from Monte Carlo simulations of pure SU(2)\ngauge theory in two and three space-time dimensions, we are able to evaluate\nthe Landau-gauge gluon propagator for lattices of linear extent up to sixteen\ntimes larger than that of the simulated lattice. The approach is reminiscent of\nFisher and Ruelle's construction of the thermodynamic limit in classical\nstatistical mechanics.\n", "  We report measurements of the frequency and temperature dependence of\nferromagnetic resonance (FMR) for a 15-nm-thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film\ngrown by off-axis sputtering. Although the FMR linewidth is narrow at room\ntemperature (corresponding to a damping coefficient $\\alpha$ = (9.0 $\\pm$ 0.2)\n$\\times 10^{-4}$), comparable to previous results for high-quality YIG films of\nsimilar thickness, the linewidth increases strongly at low temperatures, by a\nfactor of almost 30. This increase cannot be explained as due to two-magnon\nscattering from defects at the sample interfaces. We argue that the increased\nlow-temperature linewidth is due to impurity relaxation mechanisms that have\nbeen investigated previously in bulk YIG samples. We suggest that the\nlow-temperature linewidth is a useful figure of merit to guide the optimization\nof thin-film growth protocols because it is a particularly sensitive indicator\nof impurities.\n", "  Applying the connection between the parton Wigner distribution and orbital\nangular momentum (OAM), we investigate the probe of the gluon OAM in hard\nscattering processes at the planned electron-ion collider. We show that the\nsingle longitudinal target-spin asymmetry in the hard diffractive dijet\nproduction is very sensitive to the gluon OAM distribution. The associated spin\nasymmetry leads to a characteristic azimuthal angular correlation of\n$\\sin(\\phi_q -\\phi_\\Delta)$, where $\\phi_\\Delta$ and $\\phi_q$ are the azimuthal\nangles of the proton momentum transfer and the relative transverse momentum\nbetween the quark-antiquark pair. This study will enable a first measurement of\nthe gluon OAM in the proton spin sum rule.\n", "  The correspondence between the edge theory and the entanglement spectrum is\nfirmly established for the chiral topological phases. We study gapped,\ntopologically ordered, non-chiral states with a conserved $U(1)$ charge and\nshow that the entanglement Hamiltonian contains not only the information about\ntopologically distinct edges such phases may admit, but also which of them will\nbe realized in the presence of symmetry breaking/conserving perturbations. We\nintroduce an exactly solvable, charge conserving lattice model of a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid and derive its edge theory and the entanglement\nHamiltonian, also in the presence of perturbations. We construct a field theory\nof the edge and study its RG flow. We show the precise extent of the\ncorrespondence between the information contained in the entanglement\nHamiltonian and the edge theory.\n", "  Using $(223.7\\pm1.4)\\times10^6$ J/$\\psi$ events accumulated with the BESIII\ndetector, we study $\\eta_c$ decays to $\\phi\\phi$ and $\\omega\\phi$ final states.\nThe branching fraction of $\\eta_c\\to\\phi\\phi$ is measured to be\n$Br(\\eta_c\\to\\phi\\phi)=(2.5\\pm0.3^{+0.3}_{-0.7}\\pm0.6)\\times10^{-3}$, where the\nfirst uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is\nfrom the uncertainty of $Br(J/\\psi\\to\\gamma\\eta_c)$. No significant signal for\nthe double OZI-suppressed decay of $\\eta_c\\to\\omega\\phi$ is observed, and the\nupper limit on the branching fraction is determined to be\n$Br(\\eta_c\\to\\omega\\phi)<2.5\\times 10^{-4}$ at the 90\\% confidence level.\n", "  With the experimental evidences of $\\overline B {}^0\\to p \\overline{p}$ and\n$B^-\\to\\Lambda\\overline p$ decays, it is now possible to extract both tree and\npenguin amplitudes of the charmless two-body baryonic $B$ decays for the first\ntime. The extracted penguin-tree ratio agrees with the expectation. Using the\ntopological amplitude approach with the experimental results on $\\overline B\n{}^0\\to p \\overline{p}$ and $B^-\\to\\Lambda\\bar p$ decay rates as input,\npredictions on all other $\\overline B_q\\to {\\cal B} \\overline {\\cal B}$, ${\\cal\nB} \\overline {\\cal D}$, ${\\cal D} \\overline {\\cal B}$ and ${\\cal D} \\overline\n{\\cal D}$ decay rates, where ${\\mathcal B}$ and ${\\cal D}$ are the low lying\noctet and decuplet baryons, respectively, are given. It is non-trivial that the\nresults do not violate any existing experimental upper limit. From the analysis\nit is understandable that why $\\overline B {}^0\\to p \\overline{p}$ and\n$B^-\\to\\Lambda\\bar p$ modes are the first two modes with experimental\nevidences. Relations on rates are verified using the numerical results. We note\nthat the predicted $B^-\\to p\\overline{\\Delta^{++}}$ rate is close to the\nexperimental bound, which has not been updated in the last ten years. Direct\n$CP$ asymmetries of all $\\overline B_q\\to {\\cal B} \\overline {\\cal B}$, ${\\cal\nB} \\overline {\\cal D}$, ${\\cal D} \\overline {\\cal B}$ and ${\\cal D} \\overline\n{\\cal D}$ modes are explored. Relations on $CP$ asymmetries are examined using\nthe numerical results. The direct $CP$ asymmetry of $\\overline B {}^0\\to p\n\\overline{p}$ decay can be as large as $\\pm 50\\%$. The $CP$ asymmetries of\n$\\Delta S=-1$ pure penguin modes are constrained to be of few $\\%$. These modes\nare expected to be sensitive to New Physics contributions and are good\ncandidates to be added to the list of the tests of the Standard Model.\n", "  We show that two quantities in quantum metrology that were thought to be the\nsame, the quantum Fisher information matrix and the Bures metric, are not the\nsame. They differ at points at which the rank of the density matrix changes.\nThe quantum Fisher information matrix is discontinuous at these points.\nHowever, these discontinuities are removable in some sense. We show that the\nexpression given by the Bures metric represents the continuous version of the\nquantum Fisher information matrix. We also derive an explicit formula for the\nBures metric for both singular and non-singular density matrices.\n", "  Variational methods are a common approach for computing properties of ground\nstates but have not yet found analogous success in finite temperature\ncalculations. In this work we develop a new variational finite temperature\nalgorithm (VAFT) which combines ideas from minimally entangled typical thermal\nstates (METTS), variational Monte Carlo (VMC) optimization and path integral\nMonte Carlo (PIMC). This allows us to define an implicit variational density\nmatrix to estimate finite temperature properties in two and three dimensions.\nWe benchmark the algorithm on the bipartite Heisenberg model and compare to\nexact results.\n", "  Magnetoelectric materials have generated wide technological and scientific\ninterest because of the rich phenomena these materials exhibit, including the\ncoexistence of magnetic and ferroelectric orders, magnetodielectric behavior,\nand exotic hybrid excitations such as electromagnons. The multiferroic spinel\nmaterial, CoCr$_2$O$_4$, is a particularly interesting example of a\nmultiferroic material, because evidence for magnetoelectric behavior in the\nferrimagnetic phase seems to conflict with traditional noncollinear-spin-driven\nmechanisms for inducing a macroscopic polarization. This paper reports an\ninelastic light scattering study of the magnon and phonon spectrum of\nCoCr$_2$O$_4$ as simultaneous functions of temperature, pressure, and magnetic\nfield. Below the Curie temperature ($T_C \\sim 94$ K) of CoCr$_2$O$_4$ we\nobserve a $\\omega \\sim 16 \\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ $\\boldsymbol q=0$ magnon having\nT$_{1g}$-symmetry, which has the transformation properties of an axial vector.\nThe anomalously large Raman intensity of the T$_{1g}$-symmetry magnon is\ncharacteristic of materials with a large magneto-optical response and likely\narises from large magnetic fluctuations that strongly modulate the dielectric\nresponse in CoCr$_2$O$_4$. The Raman susceptibility of the T$_{1g}$-symmetry\nmagnon exhibits a strong magnetic-field dependence that is consistent with the\nmagnetodielectric response observed in CoCr$_2$O$_4$, suggesting that\nmagnetodielectric behavior in CoCr$_2$O$_4$ primarily arises from the\nfield-dependent suppression of magnetic fluctuations that are strongly coupled\nto long-wavelength phonons. Increasing the magnetic anisotropy in CoCr$_2$O$_4$\nwith applied pressure decreases the magnetic field-dependence of the\nT$_{1g}$-symmetry magnon Raman susceptibility in CoCr$_2$O$_4$, suggesting that\nstrain can be used to control the magnetodielectric response in CoCr$_2$O$_4$.\n", "  We discuss the implementation of leading-order photon production in\nnonequilibrium partonic transport simulations. In this framework photons are\nproduced by microscopic scatterings, where we include the exact matrix elements\nof Compton scattering, quark-antiquark annihilation, and bremsstrahlung\nprocesses. We show how the hard-thermal loop inspired screening of propagators\nhas to be modified such that the microscopic production rate agrees well with\nthe analytically known resummed leading-order rate. We model the complete\nquark-gluon plasma phase of heavy-ion collisions by using the partonic\ntransport approach called the Boltzmann approach to multiparton scatterings\n(BAMPS), which solves the ultrarelativistic Boltzmann equation with Monte Carlo\nmethods. We show photon spectra and elliptic flow of photons from BAMPS and\ndiscuss nonequilibrium effects. Due to the slow quark chemical equilibration in\nBAMPS, the yield is lower than the results from other groups; in turn we see a\nstrong effect from scatterings of energetic jet-like partons with the medium.\nThis nonequilibrium photon production can dominate the thermal emission, such\nthat the spectra are harder and the photonic elliptic flow of the quark-gluon\nplasma becomes negative.\n", "  We revisit cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints on primordial black\nhole dark matter. Spectral distortion limits from COBE/FIRAS do not impose a\nrelevant constraint. Planck CMB anisotropy power spectra imply that primordial\nblack holes with $m_{BH}\\gtrsim 5~M_{\\odot}$ are disfavored. However, this is\nsusceptible to sizeable uncertainties due to the treatment of the black hole\naccretion process. These constraints are weaker than those quoted in earlier\nliterature for the same observables.\n", "  Solving the challenging problem of the amplification and generation of an\nelectromagnetic field in nanostructures enables to implement many properties of\nthe electromagnetic field at the nanoscale in novel practical applications. A\nfirst-principles quantum mechanical consideration of such a problem is\nsufficiently restricted by the exponentially large number of degrees of\nfreedom, and does not allow the electromagnetic field dynamics to be described\nif it involves a high number of interacting atoms and modes of the\nelectromagnetic field. Conversely, the classical description of electromagnetic\nfields is incorrect at the nanoscale due to the high level of quantum\nfluctuations connected to high dissipation and noise levels. In this paper, we\ndevelop the framework with a significantly reduced number of degrees of\nfreedom, which describes the quantum spatial dynamics of electromagnetic fields\ninteracting with atoms. As an example, we consider the interaction between\natoms placed in a metallic subwavelength groove, and demonstrate that a\nspontaneously excited electromagnetic pulse propagates with the group velocity.\nThe developed approach may be exploited to describe non-uniform amplification\nand propagation of electromagnetic fields in arbitrary dispersive dissipative\nsystems.\n", "  Synthetic biology sets out to implement new functions in cells, and to\ndevelop a deeper understanding of biological design principles. In 2000,\nElowitz and Leibler showed that by rational design of the reaction network, and\nusing existing biological components, they could create a network that exhibits\nperiodic gene expression, dubbed the repressilator (Elowitz and Leibler,\nNature, 2000). More recently, Stricker et al. presented another synthetic\noscillator, called the dual-feedback oscillator (Stricker et al., 2008), which\nis more stable. How the stability of these oscillators is affected by the\nintrinsic noise of the interactions between the components and the stochastic\nexpression of their genes, has been studied in considerable detail. However, as\nall biological oscillators reside in growing and dividing cells, an important\nquestion is how these oscillators are perturbed by the cell cycle. In previous\nwork we showed that the periodic doubling of the gene copy numbers due to DNA\nreplication can couple not only natural, circadian oscillators to the cell\ncycle (Paijmans et al., PNAS, \\textbf{113}, 4063, (2016)), but also these\nsynthetic oscillators. Here we expand this study. We find that the strength of\nthe locking between oscillators depends not only on the positions of the genes\non the chromosome, but also on the noise in the timing of gene replication:\nnoise tends to weaken the coupling. Yet, even in the limit of high levels of\nnoise in the replication times of the genes, both synthetic oscillators show\nclear signatures of locking to the cell cycle. This work enhances our\nunderstanding of the design of robust biological oscillators inside growing and\ndiving cells.\n", "  We study the relationship between the shape of the electronic band structure\nand the thermoelectric properties. In order to study the band shape dependence\nof the thermoelectric properties generally, we first adopt models with band\nstructures having the dispersion $E({\\bf k}) \\sim |{\\bf k}|^n$ with $n = 2, 4$\nand 6. We consider one, two- and three dimensional systems, and calculate the\nthermoelectric properties using the Boltzmann equation approach within the\nconstant quasi-particle lifetime approximation. $n = 2$ corresponds to the\nusual parabolic band structure, while the band shape for $n = 4, 6$ has a flat\nportion at the band edge, so that the density of states diverges at the bottom\nof the band. We call this kind of band structure the \"pudding mold type band\".\n$n \\ge 4$ belong to the pudding mold type band, but since the density of states\ndiverges even for $n= 2$ in one dimensional system, this is also categorized as\nthe pudding mold type. Due to the large density of states and the rapid change\nof the group velocity around the band edge, the spectral conductivity of the\npudding mold type band structures becomes larger than that of the usual\nparabolic band structures. It is found that the pudding mold type band has a\ncoexistence of large Seebeck coefficient and large electric conductivity, and\nsmall Lorenz number in the Wiedemann--Franz law due to the specific band shape.\nWe also find that the low dimensionality of the band structure can contribute\nto large electronic conductivity and hence a small Lorenz number. We conclude\nthat the pudding mold type band, especially in low dimensional systems, can\nenhance not only the power factor but also the dimensionless figure of merit\ndue to stronger violation of the Wiedemann--Franz law.\n", "  We report on the observation of a circular photogalvanic current excited by\nterahertz (THz) laser radiation in helical edge channels of HgTe-based 2D\ntopological insulators (TIs). The direction of the photocurrent reverses by\nswitching the radiation polarization from right-handed to left-handed one and,\nfor fixed photon helicity, is opposite for the opposite edges. The photocurrent\nis detected in a wide range of gate voltages. With decreasing the Fermi level\nbelow the conduction band bottom, the current emerges, reaches a maximum,\ndecreases, changes its sign close to the charge neutrality point (CNP), and\nagain rises. Conductance measured over a 7 $\\mu$m distance at CNP approaches\n2e2/h, the value characteristic for ballistic transport in 2D TIs. The data\nreveal that the photocurrent is caused by photoionization of helical edge\nelectrons to the conduction band. We discuss the microscopic model of this\nphenomenon and compare calculations with the experimental data.\n", "  We present for the first time an explicit exposition of quantum corrections\nwithin the cubic Galileon theory including the effect of quantum gravity, in a\nbackground- and gauge-invariant manner, employing the field-reparametrisation\napproach of the covariant effective action at 1-loop. We show that the\nconsideration of gravitational effects in combination with the non-linear\nderivative structure of the theory reveals new interactions at the perturbative\nlevel, which manifest themselves as higher-operators in the associated\neffective action, which' relevance is controlled by appropriate ratios of the\ncosmological vacuum and the Galileon mass scale. The significance and concept\nof the covariant approach in this context is discussed, while all calculations\nare explicitly presented.\n", "  We perform an in-depth analysis of the Higgs sector in the Minimal Left-Right\nSymmetric Model and compute the scalar mass spectrum and associated mixings,\noffering simple physical and symmetry arguments in support of our findings. We\nidentify the tree-level quartic and cubic potential couplings in terms of the\nphysical states and compute the quantum corrections for the latter ones. The\ndeviations from the Standard Model prediction of the cubic Higgs doublet\ncoupling are considered. Moreover we discuss the possible implications\nconcerning the stability of the potential under the\nrenormalization-group-equations evolution. In particular we examine three\npossible energy scales of parity restoration: LHC reach, next hadronic collider\nand very high energy relevant for grand unification.\n", "  A spin liquid is a new state of matter with topological order where the spin\nmoments continue to fluctuate coherently down to the lowest temperatures rather\nthan develop static long-range magnetic order as found in conventional magnets.\nFor spin liquid behavior to arise in a material the magnetic Hamiltonian must\nbe \"frustrated\" where the combination of lattice geometry, interactions and\nanisotropies gives rise to competing spin arrangements in the ground state.\nTheoretical Hamiltonians which produce spin liquids are spin ice, the Kitaev\nhoneycomb model and the Heisenberg kagome antiferromagnet. Spin liquid behavior\nhowever in real materials is rare because they can only approximate these\nHamiltonians and often have weak higher order terms that destroy the spin\nliquid state. Ca10Cr7O28 is a new quantum spin liquid with magnetic Cr5+ ions\nthat possess quantum spin number S=1/2. The spins are entirely dynamic in the\nground state and the excitation spectrum is broad and diffuse as is typical of\nspinons which are the excitations of a spin liquid. In this paper we determine\nthe Hamiltonian of Ca10Cr7O28 using inelastic neutron scattering under high\nmagnetic field to induce a ferromagnetic ground state and spin-wave excitations\nthat can be fitted to extract the interactions. We further explore the phase\ndiagram by using inelastic neutron scattering and heat capacity measurements\nand establish the boundaries of the spin liquid phase as a function of magnetic\nfield and temperature. Our results show that Ca10Cr7O28 consists of distorted\nkagome bilayers with several isotropic ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic\ninteractions where unexpectedly the ferromagnetic interactions are stronger\nthan the antiferromagnetic ones. This complex Hamiltonian does not correspond\nto any known spin liquid model and points to new directions in the search for\nquantum spin liquid behavior.\n", "  If the scale invariance exists in nature, the so-called unparticle physics\nmay become part of reality. The only way to refute or confirm this idea is\nthrough the experiments one of which is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). One of\nthe peculiar properties of the unparticle stuff is that it gives striking\nmulti-photon signals which has been studied through only the unparticle\nself-interactions. By considering not only the self-interactions of unparticles\nbut also all the other possible contributions, which are dominant, a detailed\nstudy of the processes, within a scalar unparticle scenario, $pp\\to 4\\gamma$,\n$pp\\to 2\\gamma 2g$, $pp\\to 2\\gamma 2\\ell$, $pp\\to 4e$, $pp\\to 4\\mu$ and $pp\\to\n2e2\\mu$ at $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV at the LHC is carried out. We use basic selection\ncuts and analyze various distributions to discriminate the signals over the\nStandard Model backgrounds and discuss what seems to be the most likely channel\namong the above ones for an indirect manifestation of unparticle effects. We\nfollow a new approach to tackle the issue with the three-point correlation\nfunction for the scalar unparticle self-interactions. We also obtain the\nexclusion region in the unparticle parameter space from the available\ntwo-photon data of the LHC.\n", "  Motivated by Buscemi's semi-quantum nonlocal game [PRL 108, 200401(2012)], We\npropose an entanglement witness game, a quantum game based on entanglement\nwitness. Similar as the semi-quantum nonlocal game, the existence of\nentanglement shared by the players is necessary and sufficient for obtaining a\npositive average payoff in our entanglement witness game. Two explicit examples\nare constructed to demonstrate how to play our entanglement witness game and\nits relations with the CHSH nonlocal game.\n", "  Short-period super-Earths and Neptunes are now known to be very frequent\naround solar-type stars. Improving our understanding of these mysterious\nplanets requires the detection of a significant sample of objects suitable for\ndetailed characterization. Searching for the transits of the low-mass planets\ndetected by Doppler surveys is a straightforward way to achieve this goal.\nIndeed, Doppler surveys target the most nearby main-sequence stars, they\nregularly detect close-in low-mass planets with significant transit\nprobability, and their radial velocity data constrain strongly the ephemeris of\npossible transits. In this context, we initiated in 2010 an ambitious Spitzer\nmulti-Cycle transit search project that targeted 25 low-mass planets detected\nby radial velocity, focusing mainly on the shortest-period planets detected by\nthe HARPS spectrograph. We report here null results for 19 targets of the\nproject. For 16 planets out of 19, a transiting configuration is strongly\ndisfavored or firmly rejected by our data for most planetary compositions. We\nderive a posterior probability of 83% that none of the probed 19 planets\ntransits (for a prior probability of 22%), which still leaves a significant\nprobability of 17% that at least one of them does transit. Globally, our\nSpitzer project revealed or confirmed transits for three of its 25 targeted\nplanets, and discarded or disfavored the transiting nature of 20 of them. Our\nlight curves demonstrate for Warm Spitzer excellent photometric precisions: for\n14 targets out of 19, we were able to reach standard deviations that were\nbetter than 50ppm per 30 min intervals. Combined with its Earth-trailing orbit,\nwhich makes it capable of pointing any star in the sky and to monitor it\ncontinuously for days, this work confirms Spitzer as an optimal instrument to\ndetect sub-mmag-deep transits on the bright nearby stars targeted by Doppler\nsurveys.\n", "  Here we have shown that asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in\nthe Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (GB) theory are unstable under linear perturbations\nof spacetime in some region of parameters. This (eikonal) instability develops\nat high multipole numbers. We found the exact parametric regions of the eikonal\ninstability and extended this consideration to asymptotically flat and de\nSitter cases. The approach to the threshold of instability is driven by purely\nimaginary quasinormal modes, which are similar to those found recently in [5]\nfor the higher curvature corrected black hole with the planar horizon. The\nfound instability may indicate limits of holographic applicability of the\nGB-AdS backgrounds. Recently, through the analysis of critical behavior in AdS\nspace-time in the presence of Gauss-Bonnet term, it was shown [19] that that,\nif the total energy content of the AdS space-time is small, then no black holes\ncan be formed with mass less than some critical value. A similar mass gap was\nalso found when considering collapse of mass shells in asymptotically flat\nGauss-Bonnet theories [20]. The found instability of all sufficiently small\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet-AdS, -dS and asymptotically flat black holes may explain\nthe existing mass gaps in their formation.\n", "  Ellerman bombs (EBs) seem to be a part of a whole spectrum of phenomena that\nmight have the same underlying physical mechanism, but with observed\ncharacteristics which pose a considerable challenge to models. The aim of this\nstudy is to investigate whether the proposed mechanism, applied to the\ncircumstances of EBs, produce the observed characteristics. For this, realistic\n3D MHD simulations are used. Two different cases are presented: the quiet Sun\nand an active region. Both runs confirm that EB-like brightenings coincide with\nhot and dense plasma which is in agreement with predictions of 1D and 2D\nmodellings. The simulated EB-like phenomena assume the observed flame-like\nform, which depends on the complexity of the ongoing reconnection and the\nviewing angle. At the layers sampled by H$\\alpha$-wings, near temperature\nminimum and below, the magnetic field topology seem to be always the same. The\nfield lines there trace the base of the current sheet and the reconnected\n$\\cap$-loops. So, the EB features are caused by reconnection of strong-field\npatches of opposite polarity in the regions where the surface flows are the\nstrongest. The weakest cases among them can be reproduced quantitatively by the\ncurrent simulations.\n", "  The chromium arsenides BaCr2As2 and BaCrFeAs2 with ThCr2Si2 type structure\n(space group I4/mmm; also adopted by '122' iron arsenide superconductors) have\nbeen suggested as mother compounds for possible new superconductors. DFT-based\ncalculations of the electronic structure evidence metallic antiferromagnetic\nground states for both compounds. By powder neutron diffraction we confirm for\nBaCr2As2 a robust ordering in the antiferromagnetic G-type structure at T_N =\n580 K with mu_Cr = 1.9 mu_B at T = 2K. Anomalies in the lattice parameters\npoint to magneto-structural coupling effects. In BaCrFeAs2 the Cr and Fe atoms\nrandomly occupy the transition-metal site and G-type order is found below 265 K\nwith mu_Cr/Fe = 1.1 mu_B. 57Fe Moessbauer spectroscopy demonstrates that only a\nsmall ordered moment is associated with the Fe atoms, in agreement with\nelectronic structure calculations with mu_Fe ~ 0. The temperature dependence of\nthe hyperfine field does not follow that of the total moments. Both compounds\nare metallic but show large enhancements of the linear specific heat\ncoefficient gamma with respect to the band structure values. The metallic state\nand the electrical transport in BaCrFeAs2 is dominated by the atomic disorder\nof Cr and Fe and partial magnetic disorder of Fe. Our results indicate that\nNeel-type order is unfavorable for the Fe moments and thus it is destabilized\nwith increasing iron content.\n", "  Establishing the security of continuous-variable quantum key distribution\nagainst general attacks in a realistic finite-size regime is an outstanding\nopen problem in the field of theoretical quantum cryptography if we restrict\nour attention to protocols that rely on the exchange of coherent states.\nIndeed, techniques based on the uncertainty principle are not known to work for\nsuch protocols, and the usual tools based on de Finetti reductions only provide\nsecurity for unrealistically large block lengths. We address this problem here\nby considering a new type of Gaussian de Finetti reduction, that exploits the\ninvariance of some continuous-variable protocols under the action of the\nunitary group $U(n)$ (instead of the symmetric group $S_n$ as in usual de\nFinetti theorems), and by introducing generalized $SU(2,2)$ coherent states.\nOur reduction shows that it is sufficient to prove the security of these\nprotocols against Gaussian collective attacks in order to obtain security\nagainst general attacks, thereby confirming rigorously the widely held belief\nthat Gaussian attacks are indeed optimal against such protocols.\n", "  A long elastic cylinder, radius $a$ and shear-modulus $\\mu$, becomes unstable\ngiven sufficient surface tension $\\gamma$. We show this instability can be\nsimply understood by considering the energy, $E(\\lambda)$, of such a cylinder\nsubject to a homogenous longitudinal stretch $\\lambda$. Although $E(\\lambda)$\nhas a unique minimum, if surface tension is sufficient\n($\\Gamma\\equiv\\gamma/(a\\mu)>\\sqrt{32}$) it looses convexity in a finite region.\nWe use a Maxwell construction to show that, if stretched into this region, the\ncylinder will phase separate into two segments with different stretches\n$\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$. Our model thus explains why the instability has\ninfinite wavelength, and allows us to calculate the instability's sub-critical\nhysteresis loop (as a function of imposed stretch), showing that instability\nproceeds with constant amplitude and at constant (positive) tension as the\ncylinder is stretched between $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$. We use full\nnonlinear finite-element calculations to verify these predictions, and to\ncharacterize the interface between the two phases. Near $\\Gamma=\\sqrt{32}$ the\nlength of such an interface diverges introducing a new length-scale and\nallowing us to construct a 1-D effective theory. This treatment yields an\nanalytic expression for the interface itself, revealing its characteristic\nlength grows as $l_{wall}\\sim a/\\sqrt{\\Gamma-\\sqrt{32}}$.\n", "  Based on $e^+e^-$ annihilation data samples collected with the BESIII\ndetector at the BEPCII collider at 13 center of mass energies from 4.008 to\n4.600 GeV, measurements of the Born cross section of $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow p\n\\bar{p} \\pi^{0}$ are performed. No significant resonant structure is observed\nin the measured energy-dependent cross section. The upper limit on the Born\ncross section of $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow Y(4260) \\rightarrow p \\bar{p} \\pi^{0}$\nat the 90\\% C.L. is determined to be 0.01 pb.\n", "  We present here predictions for the spatial distribution of 21 cm brightness\ntemperature fluctuations from high-dynamic-range simulations for AGN-dominated\nreionization histories that have been tested against available Lyman-alpha and\nCMB data. We model AGN by extrapolating the observed M-sigma relation to high\nredshifts and assign them ionizing emissivities consistent with recent UV\nluminosity function measurements. We assess the observability of the predicted\nspatial 21 cm fluctuations by ongoing and upcoming experiments in the late\nstages of reionization in the limit in which the hydrogen 21 cm spin\ntemperature is significantly larger than the CMB temperature. Our AGN-dominated\nreionization histories increase the variance of the 21 cm emission by a factor\nof up to ten compared to similar reionization histories dominated by faint\ngalaxies, to values close to 100 mK^2 at scales accessible to experiments (k <\n1 h/cMpc). This is lower than the sensitivity claimed to have been already\nreached by ongoing experiments by only a factor of about two or less. When\nreionization is dominated by AGN, the 21 cm power spectrum is enhanced on all\nscales due to the enhanced bias of the clustering of the more massive haloes\nand the peak in the large scale 21 cm power is strongly enhanced and moved to\nlarger scales due to bigger characteristic bubble sizes. AGN dominated\nreionization should be easily detectable by LOFAR (and later HERA and SKA1) at\ntheir design sensitivity, assuming successful foreground subtraction and\ninstrument calibration. Conversely, these could become the first non-trivial\nreionization scenarios to be ruled out by 21 cm experiments, thereby\nconstraining the contribution of AGN to reionization.\n", "  The origin and life-cycle of molecular clouds are still poorly constrained,\ndespite their importance for understanding the evolution of the interstellar\nmedium. We have carried out a systematic, homogeneous, spectroscopic survey of\nthe inner Galactic plane, in order to complement the many continuum Galactic\nsurveys available with crucial distance and gas-kinematic information. Our aim\nis to combine this data set with recent infrared to sub-millimetre surveys at\nsimilar angular resolutions. The SEDIGISM survey covers 78 deg^2 of the inner\nGalaxy (-60 deg < l < +18 deg, |b| < 0.5 deg) in the J=2-1 rotational\ntransition of 13CO. This isotopologue of CO is less abundant than 12CO by\nfactors up to 100. Therefore, its emission has low to moderate optical depths,\nand higher critical density, making it an ideal tracer of the cold, dense\ninterstellar medium. The data have been observed with the SHFI single-pixel\ninstrument at APEX. The observational setup covers the 13CO(2-1) and C18O(2-1)\nlines, plus several transitions from other molecules. The observations have\nbeen completed. Data reduction is in progress, and the final data products will\nbe made available in the near future. Here we give a detailed description of\nthe survey and the dedicated data reduction pipeline. Preliminary results based\non a science demonstration field covering -20 deg < l < -18.5 deg are\npresented. Analysis of the 13CO(2-1) data in this field reveals compact clumps,\ndiffuse clouds, and filamentary structures at a range of heliocentric\ndistances. By combining our data with data in the (1-0) transition of CO\nisotopologues from the ThrUMMS survey, we are able to compute a 3D realization\nof the excitation temperature and optical depth in the interstellar medium.\nUltimately, this survey will provide a detailed, global view of the inner\nGalactic interstellar medium at an unprecedented angular resolution of ~30\".\n", "  We determine the finite temperature phase diagram of two dimensional bosons\nwith two hyperfine (pseudo-spin) states coupled via Rashba-Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit interaction using classical field Monte Carlo calculations. For\nanisotropic spin-orbit coupling, we find a transition to a\nBerenzinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless superfluid phase with quasi-long range order.\nWe show that the spin-order of the quasi-condensate is driven by the anisotropy\nof interparticle interaction, favoring either a homogeneous plane wave state or\nstripe phase with broken translational symmetry. Both phases show\ncharacteristic behavior in the algebraically decaying spin density correlation\nfunction. For fully isotropic interparticle interaction, our calculations\nindicate a fractionalized quasi-condensate where the mean-field degeneracy of\nplane wave and stripe phase remains robust against critical fluctuations. In\nthe case of fully isotropic spin-orbit coupling, the circular degeneracy of the\nsingle particle ground state destroys the algebraic ordered phase in the\nthermodynamic limit, but a cross-over remains for finite size systems.\n", "  Caldeira and Leggett (CL) in a seminal paper derived a master equation\ndescribing Markovian Quantum Brownian motion. Such an equation suffered of not\nbeing completely positive, and many efforts have been made to solve this issue.\nWe show that, when a careful mathematical analysis is performed, the model\nconsidered by CL leads to a non dissipative master equation. We argue that the\ncorrect way to understand the master equation derived in the CL regime is to\nconsider it non-Markovian. Moreover, we show that if one wants to provide a\nmicroscopic description of Quantum Brownian motion with the CL model, one\nalways needs to consider a non-Markovian dynamics. We conclude that dissipation\nis a genuinely non-Markovian feature.\n", "  Recent classical-statistical numerical simulations have established the\n\"bottom-up\" thermalization scenario of Baier et al. as the correct weak\ncoupling effective theory for thermalization in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions. We perform a parametric study of photon production in the various\nstages of this bottom-up framework to ascertain the relative contribution of\nthe off-equilibrium \"Glasma\" relative to that of a thermalized Quark-Gluon\nPlasma. Taking into account the constraints imposed by the measured charged\nhadron multiplicities at RHIC and the LHC, we find that Glasma contributions\nare important especially for large values of the saturation scale at both\nenergies. These non-equilibrium effects should therefore be taken into account\nin studies where weak coupling methods are employed to compute photon yields.\n", "  The production of $J/\\psi$ mesons in jets is studied in the forward region of\nproton-proton collisions using data collected with the LHCb detector at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The fraction of the jet transverse momentum\ncarried by the $J/\\psi$ meson, $z \\equiv p_{\\rm T}(J/\\psi)/p_{\\rm T}({\\rm\njet})$, is measured using jets with $p_{\\rm T}({\\rm jet}) > 20$ GeV in the\npseudorapidity range $2.5 < \\eta({\\rm jet}) < 4.0$. The observed $z$\ndistribution for $J/\\psi$ mesons produced in $b$-hadron decays is consistent\nwith expectations. However, the results for prompt $J/\\psi$ production do not\nagree with predictions based on fixed-order non-relativistic QCD. This is the\nfirst measurement of the $p_{\\rm T}$ fraction carried by prompt $J/\\psi$ mesons\nin jets at any experiment.\n", "  The one-body density matrix (OBDM) of a strongly interacting spinor quantum\ngas in one dimension can be written as a summation of products of spatial and\nspin parts. We find that there is a remarkable connection between the spatial\npart and the OBDM of a spinless hard-core anyon gas. This connection allows us\nto efficiently calculate the OBDM of the spinor system with particle numbers\nmuch larger than what was previously possible. Given the OBDM, we can easily\ncalculate the momentum distribution of the spinor system, which again is\nrelated to the momentum distribution of the hard-core ayone gas.\n", "  Recent advances have attracted attention to non-standard Josephson junctions\nin which a supercurrent can flow despite zero phase difference between the\nconstituent superconducting leads. Here, we propose a zero-phase-difference\nnanoelectromechanical junction which, in contrast to other considered systems,\nexhibits symmetry between leftward and rightward tunneling through the\njunction. We show that a supercurrent is nevertheless possible as a result of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking. In the suggested junction, the supercurrent is\nmediated by tunneling via a superconducting Cooper-pair box on a bendable\ncantilever. An alternating electric potential parametrically excites mechanical\noscillations which are synchronized with charge oscillations of the box. This\nleads to coherent transfer of Cooper pairs through the junction. The direction\nof the supercurrent is a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking and thus it\ncan be reversed without changing the parameters.\n", "  The ability to manipulate ferroelectrics at ultrafast speeds has long been an\nelusive target for materials research. Coherently exciting the ferroelectric\nmode with ultrashort optical pulses holds the promise to switch the\nferroelectric polarization on femtosecond timescale, two orders of magnitude\nfaster compared to what is possible today with pulsed electric fields. Here, we\nreport on the demonstration of ultrafast optical reversal of the ferroelectric\npolarization in LiNbO3. Rather than driving the ferroelectric mode directly, we\ncouple to it indirectly by resonant excitation of an auxiliary high-frequency\nphonon mode with femtosecond mid-infrared pulses. Due to strong anharmonic\ncoupling between these modes, the atoms are directionally displaced along the\nferroelectric mode and the polarization is transiently reversed, as revealed by\ntime-resolved, phase-sensitive second-harmonic generation. This reversal can be\ninduced in both directions, a key pre-requisite for practical applications.\n", "  Here, we present a study on Si(111)/\\-Ta($150$\\AA )/\\-IrMn($150$\\AA\n)/\\-NiFe($50$\\AA )/\\-Nb($x$)/\\-NiFe($50$\\AA )/\\-Ta($50$\\AA ) and\nSi(111)/\\-Ta($150$\\AA )/\\-NiFe($50$\\AA )/\\-Nb($x$)/\\-NiFe($50$\\AA\n)/\\-IrMn($150$\\AA )/\\-Ta($50$\\AA ) spin-valves with $x=100$ to $500$\\AA . For\nboth sample families, above a specific critical thickness of the Nb-layer and\nbelow $T_c$, the superconducting Nb-layer contributes strongly to the\nmagnetization. These systems show an anomalous hysteresis loop in the\nmagnetization of the superconducting layer; the hysteresis loop is similar to\nwhat is generally expected from hard superconductors and many\nsuperconductor/ferromagnet hybrid systems, but the direction of the hysteresis\nloop is inverted, compared to what is generally observed (paramagnetic for up\nsweeping fields and diamagnetic for down sweeping fields). This means that the\nrespective samples exhibit a magnetization, which is contrary to what should be\nexpected from the Lenz' rule.\n", "  The massive neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) accretion disk resulting\nfrom NS--NS or NS--BH mergers is dense in neutrinos. We present the first study\non the role of angular distributions in the neutrino flavor conversion above\nthe remnant disk. In particular, we focus on \"fast\" pairwise conversions whose\nrate depends on the local angular intensity of the electron lepton number\ncarried by neutrinos. Because of the emission geometry and the flux density of\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$ being larger than that of $\\nu_e$, fast conversions prove to be a\ngeneric phenomenon in NS--NS and NS--BH mergers for physically motivated\ndisturbances in the mean field of flavor coherence. Our findings suggest that,\ndifferently from the core-collapse supernova case, fast flavor conversions seem\nto be unavoidable in compact mergers and could have major consequences for the\njet dynamics and the synthesis of elements above the remnant disk.\n", "  The aim of these notes is to give an accessible and self-contained\nintroduction to the theory of gravitational waves as the theory of a\nrelativistic symmetric tensor field in a Minkowski background spacetime. This\nis the approach of a particle physicist: the graviton is identified with a\nparticular irreducible representation of the Poincar\\'e group, corresponding to\nvanishing mass and spin two. It is shown how to construct an action functional\ngiving the linear dynamics of gravitons, and how General Relativity can be\nobtained from it. The Hamiltonian formulation of the linear theory is examined\nin detail. We study the emission of gravitational waves and apply the results\nto the simplest case of a binary Newtonian system.\n", "  We investigate the formation and dynamics of spin textures in\nantiferromagnetic insulators adjacent to a heavy-metal substrate with strong\nspin-orbit interactions. Exchange coupling to conduction electrons engenders an\neffective anisotropy, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and a magnetoelectric\neffect for the N\\'{e}el order, which can conspire to produce nontrivial\nantiferromagnetic textures. Current-driven spin transfer enabled by the heavy\nmetal, furthermore, triggers ultrafast (THz) oscillations of the N\\'{e}el order\nfor dc currents exceeding a critical threshold, opening up the possibility of\nTerahertz spin-torque self-oscillators. For a commonly invoked\nantidamping-torque geometry, however, the instability current scales with the\nenergy gap of the antiferromagnetic insulator and, therefore, may be\nchallenging to reach experimentally. We propose an alternative generic geometry\nfor inducing ultrafast autonomous antiferromagnetic dynamics.\n", "  In the present contribution, we study the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation\nwith two versions of structural derivatives recently proposed: the scale\n$q-$derivative in the non-extensive statistical mechanics and the axiomatic\nmetric derivative, which presents Mittag-Leffler functions as eigenfunctions.\nThe use of structural derivatives aims to take into account long-range forces,\npossible non-manifest or hidden interactions and the dimensionality of space.\nHaving this purpose in mind, we build up an evolution operator and a deformed\nversion of the LLG equation. Damping in the oscillations naturally show up\nwithout an explicit Gilbert damping term.\n", "  This work is motivated by the long-standing question about the internal\nstability of the electron. While one cannot investigate internal properties of\na point-like particle, it is fair to analyze the response of the Dirac sea to\nan electron. For this purpose the concept of an exchange hole is generalized\nfrom the Fermi sea of condensed matter physics to the Dirac sea of quantum\nelectrodynamics. In order to conserve charge and angular momentum, an exchange\nelectron is added to the exchange hole, forming a neutral exchange exciton.\nConsequently, the pair correlation defining the exchange hole is generalized to\na three-fermion correlation. An approximation by sequential pair correlations\nprovides analytic results for charge densities, average distances, and force\ndensities of the exchange hole and electron. The analysis is supported by\nanalogies to the negative ion of positronium.\n", "  We theoretically investigate a spin-orbit coupled $s$-wave superfluid Fermi\ngas, to examine the time evolution of the system, after an $s$-wave pairing\ninteraction is replaced by a $p$-wave one at $t=0$. In our recent paper, we\nproposed that this manipulation may realize a $p$-wave superfluid Fermi gas,\nbecause the $p$-wave pair amplitude that is induced in the $s$-wave superfluid\nstate by a parity-broken antisymmetric spin-orbit interaction gives a\nnon-vanishing $p$-wave superfluid order parameter, immediately after the\n$p$-wave interaction is turned on. In this paper, using a time-dependent\nBogoliubov-de Gennes theory, we assess this idea under various conditions with\nrespect to the $s$-wave and $p$-wave interaction strengths, as well as the\nspin-orbit coupling strength. From these, we clarify that the momentum\ndistribution of Fermi atoms in the initial $s$-wave state ($t<0$) is a key to\nproduce a large $p$-wave superfluid order parameter. Since the realization of a\n$p$-wave superfluid state is one of the most exciting and difficult challenges\nin cold Fermi gas physics, our results may provide a possible way to accomplish\nthis.\n", "  In the present work, we study the largest structures of the CMB temperature\nmeasured by Planck in terms of the most prominent peaks on the sky, which, in\nparticular, are located in the southern galactic hemisphere. Besides these\nlarge-scale features, the well-known Cold Spot anomaly is included in the\nanalysis. All these peaks would contribute significantly to some of the CMB\nlarge-scale anomalies, as the parity and hemispherical asymmetries, the dipole\nmodulation, the alignment between the quadrupole and the octopole, or in the\ncase of the Cold Spot, to the non-Gaussianity of the field. The analysis of the\npeaks is performed by using their multipolar profiles, which characterize the\nlocal shape of the peaks in terms of the discrete Fourier transform of the\nazimuthal angle. In order to quantify the local anisotropy of the peaks, the\ndistribution of the phases of the multipolar profiles is studied by using the\nRayleigh random walk methodology. Finally, a direct analysis of the\n2-dimensional field around the peaks is performed in order to take into account\nthe effect of the galactic mask. The results of the analysis conclude that,\nonce the peak amplitude and its first and second order derivatives at the\ncentre are conditioned, the rest of the field is compatible with the standard\nmodel. In particular, it is observed that the Cold Spot anomaly is caused by\nthe large value of curvature at the centre.\n", "  Machine learning based on convolutional neural networks can be used to study\njet images from the LHC. Top tagging in fat jets offers a well-defined\nframework to establish our DeepTop approach and compare its performance to\nQCD-based top taggers. We first optimize a network architecture to identify top\nquarks in Monte Carlo simulations of the Standard Model production channel.\nUsing standard fat jets we then compare its performance to a multivariate\nQCD-based top tagger. We find that both approaches lead to comparable\nperformance, establishing convolutional networks as a promising new approach\nfor multivariate hypothesis-based top tagging.\n", "  We discuss the Dirac CP violating phase $\\delta_{CP}$ in the Froggatt-Nielsen\nmodel for a neutrino mass matrix $M_\\nu$ imposing a condition ${\\rm det}\n[M_\\nu]=0$. This additional condition restricts the CP violating phase\n$\\delta_{CP}$ drastically. We find that the phase $\\delta_{CP}$ is predicted in\nthe region of $\\pm (0.4- 2.9)$ radian, which is consistent with the recent T2K\nand NO$\\nu$A data. There is a remarkable correlation between $\\delta_{CP}$ and\n$\\sin^2\\theta_{23}$. The phase $\\delta_{CP}$ converges on $\\sim \\pm \\pi/2$ if\n$\\sin^2\\theta_{23}$ is larger than $0.5$. Thus, accurate measurements of\n$\\sin^2\\theta_{23}$ are important for a test of our model. The effective mass\n$m_{ee}$ for the neutrinoless double beta decay is predicted in the rage of\n$3.3-4.0$ meV.\n", "  We study a one-dimensional topological superconductor, the Kitaev chain,\nunder the influence of a non-Hermitian but $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric potential.\nThis potential introduces gain and loss in the system in equal parts. We show\nthat the stability of the topological phase is influenced by the gain/loss\nstrength and explicitly derive the bulk topological invariant in a bipartite\nlattice as well as compute the corresponding phase diagram using analytical and\nnumerical methods. Furthermore we find that the edge state is exponentially\nlocalized near the ends of the wire despite the presence of gain and loss of\nprobability amplitude in that region.\n", "  In Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) and other similar applications of\nsuperconducting microresonators, both the large and small-signal behaviour of\nthe device may be affected by electrothermal feedback. Microwave power applied\nto read out the device is absorbed by and heats the superconductor\nquasiparticles, changing the superconductor conductivity and hence the readout\npower absorbed in a positive or negative feedback loop. In this work, we\nexplore numerically the implications of an extensible theoretical model of a\ngeneric superconducting microresonator device for a typical KID, incorporating\nrecent work on the power flow between superconductor quasiparticles and\nphonons. This model calculates the large-signal (changes in operating point)\nand small-signal behaviour of a device, allowing us to determine the effect of\nelectrothermal feedback on device responsivity and noise characteristics under\nvarious operating conditions. We also investigate how thermally isolating the\ndevice from the bath, for example by designing the device on a membrane only\nconnected to the bulk substrate by thin legs, affects device performance. We\nfind that at a typical device operating point, positive electrothermal feedback\nreduces the effective thermal conductance from the superconductor\nquasiparticles to the bath, and so increases responsivity to signal\n(pair-breaking) power, increases noise from temperature fluctuations, and\ndecreases the Noise Equivalent Power (NEP). Similarly, increasing the thermal\nisolation of the device while keeping the quasiparticle temperature constant\ndecreases the NEP, but also decreases the device response bandwidth.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model\nwith spin-dependent anisotropic hopping at half-filling. The system develops\nIsing antiferromagnetic long-range order already at infinitesimal repulsive\ninteraction strength in the ground state. Outside the perturbative regime,\nunbiased predictions for the critical temperatures of the Ising antiferromagnet\nare made for representative interaction values by a variety of state-of-the-art\nquantum Monte Carlo methods, including the diagrammatic Monte Carlo,\ncontinuous-time determinantal Monte Carlo and path-integral Monte Carlo\nmethods. Our findings are relevant to ultracold atom experiments in the\np-orbital or with spin-dependent optical lattices.\n", "  In the context of quantum tomography, we recently introduced a quantity\ncalled a partial determinant \\cite{jackson2015detecting}. PDs (partial\ndeterminants) are explicit functions of the collected data which are sensitive\nto the presence of state-preparation-and-measurment (SPAM) correlated errors.\nAs such, PDs bypass the need to estimate state-preparation or measurement\nparameters individually. In the present work, we suggest a theoretical\nperspective for the PD. We show that the PD is a holonomy and that the notions\nof state, measurement, and tomography can be generalized to non-holonomic\nconstraints. To illustrate and clarify these abstract concepts, direct\nanalogies are made to parallel transport, thermodynamics, and gauge field\ntheory. This paper is the first of a two part series where the second paper [2]\nis about scalable applications of the PD to multiqudit systems.\n", "  We study the impact of non-zero (and apparently large) value of the nucleon\nmass $M$ on the shape of parton quasi-distributions $Q(y,p_3)$, in particular\non its change with the change of the nucleon momentum $p_3$. We observe that\nthe usual target-mass corrections induced by the $M$-dependence of the twist-2\noperators are rather small. Moreover, we show that within the framework based\non parametrizations by transverse momentum dependent distribution functions\n(TMDs) these corrections are canceled by higher-twist contributions. We\nidentify a novel source of kinematic target-mass dependence of TMDs and build\nmodels corrected for such dependence. We find that resulting changes may be\nsafely neglected for $p_3 \\gtrsim 2M$.\n", "  We demonstrate experimental implementation of robust phase estimation (RPE)\nto learn the phases of X and Y rotations on a trapped $\\textrm{Yb}^+$ ion\nqubit. We estimate these phases with uncertainties less than $4\\cdot10^{-4}$\nradians using as few as 176 total experimental samples per phase, and our\nestimates exhibit Heisenberg scaling. Unlike standard phase estimation\nprotocols, RPE neither assumes perfect state preparation and measurement, nor\nrequires access to ancillae. We cross-validate the results of RPE with the more\nresource-intensive protocol of gate set tomography.\n", "  Disk-integrated photometric data of asteroids do not contain accurate\ninformation on shape details or size scale. Additional data such as\ndisk-resolved images or stellar occultation measurements further constrain\nasteroid shapes and allow size estimates. We aim to use all available\ndisk-resolved images of about forty asteroids obtained by the Near-InfraRed\nCamera (Nirc2) mounted on the W.M. Keck II telescope together with the\ndisk-integrated photometry and stellar occultation measurements to determine\ntheir volumes. We can then use the volume, in combination with the known mass,\nto derive the bulk density. We download and process all asteroid disk-resolved\nimages obtained by the Nirc2 that are available in the Keck Observatory Archive\n(KOA). We combine optical disk-integrated data and stellar occultation profiles\nwith the disk-resolved images and use the All-Data Asteroid Modeling (ADAM)\nalgorithm for the shape and size modeling. Our approach provides constraints on\nthe expected uncertainty in the volume and size as well. We present shape\nmodels and volume for 41 asteroids. For 35 asteroids, the knowledge of their\nmass estimates from the literature allowed us to derive their bulk densities.\nWe clearly see a trend of lower bulk densities for primitive objects\n(C-complex) than for S-complex asteroids. The range of densities in the\nX-complex is large, suggesting various compositions. Moreover, we identified a\nfew objects with rather peculiar bulk densities, which is likely a hint of\ntheir poor mass estimates. Asteroid masses determined from the Gaia astrometric\nobservations should further refine most of the density estimates.\n", "  Past UV and optical observations of stars hosting hot Jupiters have shown\nthat some of these stars present an anomalously low chromospheric activity,\nsignificantly below the basal level. For WASP-13, observations have shown that\nthe apparent lack of activity is possibly caused by absorption from the\nintervening ISM. Inspired by this result, we study the effect of ISM absorption\non activity measurements (S and logR'$_{\\rm HK}$ indices) for main-sequence\nlate-type stars. To this end, we employ synthetic stellar photospheric spectra\ncombined with varying amounts of chromospheric emission and ISM absorption. We\npresent the effect of ISM absorption on activity measurements by varying\nseveral instrumental, stellar, and ISM parameters. We find that for relative\nvelocities between the stellar and ISM lines smaller than 30-40 km/s and for\nISM CaII column densities logN$_{\\rm CaII}$>12, the ISM absorption has a\nsignificant influence on activity measurements. Direct measurements and three\ndimensional maps of the Galactic ISM absorption indicate that an ISM CaII\ncolumn density of logN$_{\\rm CaII}$=12 is typically reached by a distance of\nabout 100 pc along most sight lines. In particular, for a Sun-like star lying\nat a distance greater than 100 pc, we expect a depression (bias) in the\nlogR'$_{\\rm HK}$ value larger than 0.05-0.1 dex, about the same size as the\ntypical measurement and calibration uncertainties on this parameter. This work\nshows that the bias introduced by ISM absorption must always be considered when\nmeasuring activity for stars lying beyond 100 pc. We also consider the effect\nof multiple ISM absorption components. We discuss the relevance of this result\nfor exoplanet studies.\n", "  Massless Dirac fermions in graphene provide unprecedented opportunities to\nrealize the Klein paradox, which is one of the most exotic and striking\nproperties of relativistic particles. In the seminal theoretical work\n[Katsnelson et al., Nat. Phys. 2 620 (2006)], it was predicted that the\nmassless Dirac fermions can pass through one-dimensional (1D) potential\nbarriers unimpededly at normal incidence. Such a result seems to preclude\nconfinement of the massless Dirac fermions in graphene by using 1D potential\nbarriers. Here, we demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that\nmassless Dirac fermions can be trapped in quasi-1D npn junction of a continuous\ngraphene monolayer. Because of highly anisotropic transmission of the massless\nDirac fermions at n-p junction boundaries (the so-called Klein tunneling in\ngraphene), charge carries incident at large oblique angles will be reflected\nfrom one edge of the junction with high probability and continue to bounce from\nthe opposite edge. Consequently, these electrons are trapped for a finite time\nto form quasi-bound states in the quasi-1D npn junction. The quasi-bound states\nseen as pronounced resonances are probed and the quantum interference patterns\narising from these states are directly visualized in our scanning tunneling\nmicroscope measurements.\n", "  We measure the homogeneous excitation linewidth of regioregular\npoly(3-hexylthiophene), a model semicrystalline polymeric semiconductor, by\nmeans of two-dimensional coherent photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. At\na temperature of 8\\,K, we find a linewidth that is always $\\gtrsim 110$\\,meV\nfull-width-at-half-maximum, which is a significant fraction of the total\nlinewidth. It displays a spectral dependence and is minimum near the 0--0\norigin peak. We interpret this spectral dependence of the homogeneous\nexcitation linewidth within the context of a weakly coupled aggregate model.\n", "  We add a prescription to the Newman-Janis algorithm in order to use it as a\nmeans of finding new extended (`through r<0') rotating black hole spacetimes\nfrom static spherically symmetric ones. Then, we apply the procedure to a\nquantum improved black hole spacetime coming from Quantum Einstein Gravity. The\ngoal is to get a maximally extended spacetime corresponding to a non-singular\nrotating black hole emulating the standard maximally extended Kerr black hole\nin regions where quantum effects are negligible. We rigourously check for the\nexistence of scalar curvature singularities in the quantum improved rotating\nspacetime and we show that it is devoid of them. We also analyze the horizons\nand causal structure of the rotating black hole and provide Penrose diagrams\nfor the maximally extended spacetime.\n", "  We analyze the charge- and spin response functions of rare-earth nickelates\nRNiO3 and their heterostructures using random-phase approximation in a two-band\nHubbard model. The inter-orbital charge fluctuation is found to be the driving\nmechanism for the rock-salt type bond order in bulk RNiO3, and good agreement\nof the ordering temperature with experimental values is achieved for all RNiO3\nusing realistic crystal structures and interaction parameters. We further show\nthat magnetic ordering in bulk is not driven by the spin fluctuation and should\nbe instead explained as ordering of localized moments. This picture changes for\nlow-dimensional heterostructures, where the charge fluctuation is suppressed\nand overtaken by the enhanced spin instability, which results in a\nspin-density-wave ground state observed in recent experiments. Predictions for\nspectroscopy allow for further experimental testing of our claims.\n", "  Context. Distinguishing between a signal induced by either stellar activity\nor a planet is currently the main challenge in radial velocity searches for\nlow-mass exoplanets. Even when the presence of a transiting planet and hence\nits period are known, stellar activity can be the main barrier to measuring the\ncorrect amplitude of the radial velocity signal. Several tools are being used\nto help understand which signals come from stellar activity in the data. Aims.\nWe aim to present a new tool that can be used for the purpose of identifying\nperiodicities caused by stellar activity, and show how it can be used to track\nthe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the detection over time. The tool is based\non the principle that stellar activity signals are variable and incoherent.\nMethods. We calculate the Bayesian general Lomb-Scargle periodogram for subsets\nof data and by adding one extra data point we track what happens to the\npresence and significance of periodicities in the data. Publicly available\ndatasets from HARPS and HARPS-N were used for this purpose. Additionally, we\nanalysed a synthetic dataset that we created with SOAP2.0 to simulate pure\nstellar activity and a mixture of stellar activity and a planet. Results. We\nfind that this tool can easily be used to identify unstable and incoherent\nsignals, such as those introduced by stellar activity. The SNR of the detection\ngrows approximately as the square root of the number of data points, in the\ncase of a stable signal. This can then be used to make decisions on whether it\nis useful to keep observing a specific object. The tool is relatively fast and\neasy to use, and thus lends itself perfectly to a quick analysis of the data.\n", "  The mechanism responsible for the warp of our Galaxy, as well as its\ndynamical nature, continues to remain unknown. With the advent of high\nprecision astrometry, new horizons have been opened for detecting the\nkinematics associated with the warp and constraining possible warp formation\nscenarios for the Milky Way. The aim of this contribution is to establish\nwhether the first Gaia data release (DR1) shows significant evidence of the\nkinematic signature expected from a long-lived Galactic warp in the kinematics\nof distant OB stars. As the first paper in a series, we present our approach\nfor analyzing the proper motions and apply it to the sub-sample of Hipparcos\nstars. We select a sample of 989 distant spectroscopically-identified OB stars\nfrom the New Reduction of Hipparcos, of which 758 are also in Gaia DR1,\ncovering distances from 0.5 to 3 kpc from the Sun. We develop a model of the\nspatial distribution and kinematics of the OB stars from which we produce the\nprobability distribution functions of the proper motions, with and without the\nsystematic motions expected from a long-lived warp. A likelihood analysis is\nused to compare the expectations of the models with the observed proper motions\nfrom both Hipparcos and Gaia DR1. We find that the proper motions of the nearby\nOB stars are consistent with the signature of a warp, while those of the more\ndistant stars (parallax<1 mas) are not. The kinematics of our sample of young\nOB stars suggests that systematic vertical motions in the disk cannot be\nexplained by a simple model of a stable long-lived warp. The Galactic warp may\neither be a transient feature, or additional phenomena are acting on the\ngaseous component of the Milky Way, causing systematic vertical motions that\nare masking the expected warp signal. A larger and deeper sample of stars with\nGaia astrometry will be needed to constrain the dynamical nature of the\nGalactic warp.\n", "  A combined analysis of the reactions $\\pi^+p\\to \\pi^+p$, $\\pi^-p\\to \\pi^-p$\nand $\\pi^-p\\to \\pi^0n$ is carried out with a chiral quark model. The\nobservations are reasonably described from the $\\Delta(1232)$ resonance region\nup to the $N(1440)$ resonance region. Besides the $\\Delta(1232)P_{33}$, a\nconfirmed role of $N(1440)P_{11}$ is found in the polarizations of the\n$\\pi^-p\\to \\pi^-p$ and $\\pi^-p\\to\\pi^0n$ reactions. It is found that the\n$N(1440)N\\pi$ and $\\Delta(1232)N\\pi$ couplings are about $1.7$ and $4.8$ times\nlarger than the expectations from the simple quark model, respectively, which\nmay suggest the unusual property of $N(1440)P_{11}$ and deficiency of the\nsimple quark model in the description of $N(1440)P_{11}$ and\n$\\Delta(1232)P_{33}$. The $t$- and $u$-channel backgrounds have notable\ncontributions to the $\\pi^+ p\\rightarrow\\pi^+ p$ reaction, while in the\n$\\pi^-p\\rightarrow \\pi^- p,\\pi^0 n$ reactions, the $s$-channel nucleon and $t$-\nand $u$-channel backgrounds play crucial roles.\n", "  We analyze the pressure and density equations of state of unpolarized\nnon-relativistic fermions at finite temperature in one spatial dimension. For\nattractively interacting regimes, we perform a third-order lattice perturbation\ntheory calculation, assess its convergence properties by comparing with hybrid\nMonte Carlo results (there is no sign problem in this regime), and demonstrate\nagreement with real Langevin calculations. For repulsive interactions, we\npresent lattice perturbation theory results as well as complex Langevin\ncalculations, with a modified action to prevent uncontrolled excursions in the\ncomplex plane. Although perturbation theory is a common tool, our\nimplementation of it is unconventional; we use a Hubbard-Stratonovich\ntransformation to decouple the system and automate the application of Wick's\ntheorem, thus generating the diagrammatic expansion, including symmetry\nfactors, at any desired order. We also present an efficient technique to tackle\nnested Matsubara frequency sums without relying on contour integration, which\nis independent of dimension and applies to both relativistic and\nnon-relativistic systems, as well as all energy-independent interactions. We\nfind exceptional agreement between perturbative and non-perturbative results at\nweak couplings, and furnish predictions based on complex Langevin at strong\ncouplings. We additionally present perturbative calculations of up to the\nfifth-order virial coefficient for repulsive and attractive couplings. Both the\nlattice perturbation theory and complex Langevin formalisms can easily be\nextended to a variety of situations including polarized systems, bosons, and\nhigher dimension.\n", "  The power of robotic telescopes to transform science education has been\nvoiced by multiple sources, since the 1980s. Since then, much technical\nprogress has been made in robotic telescope provision to end users via a\nvariety of different approaches. The educational transformation hoped for by\nthe provision of this technology has, so far, yet to be achieved on a scale\nmatching the technical advancements. In this paper, the history, definition,\nrole and rationale of optical robotic telescopes with a focus on their use in\neducation is provided. The current telescope access providers and educational\nprojects and their broad uses in traditional schooling, undergraduate and\noutreach are then outlined. From this background, the current challenges to the\nfield, which are numerous, are then presented. This review is concluded with a\nseries of recommendations for current and future projects that are apparent and\nhave emerged from the literature.\n", "  The free energy at zero temperature of Coulomb gas systems in generic\ndimension is considered as a function of a volume constraint. The transition\nbetween the 'pulled' and the 'pushed' phases is characterised as a third-order\nphase transition, in all dimensions and for a rather large class of isotropic\npotentials. This suggests that the critical behaviour of the free energy at the\n'pulled-to-pushed' transition may be universal, i.e., to some extent\nindependent of the dimension and the details of the pairwise interaction.\n", "  We perform a numerical study of the F-model with domain-wall boundary\nconditions. Various exact results are known for this particular case of the\nsix-vertex model, including closed expressions for the partition function for\nany system size as well as its asymptotics and leading finite-size corrections.\nTo complement this picture we use a full lattice multi-cluster algorithm to\nstudy equilibrium properties of this model for systems of moderate size, up to\nL=512. We compare the energy to its exactly known large-L asymptotics. We\ninvestigate the model's infinite-order phase transition by means of finite-size\nscaling for an observable derived from the staggered polarization in order to\ntest the method put forward in our recent joint work with Duine and Barkema. In\naddition we analyse local properties of the model. Our data are perfectly\nconsistent with analytical expressions for the arctic curves. We investigate\nthe structure inside the temperate region of the lattice, confirming the\noscillations in vertex densities that were first observed by Sylju{\\aa}sen and\nZvonarev, and recently studied by Lyberg et al. We point out\n'(anti)ferroelectric' oscillations close to the corresponding frozen regions as\nwell as 'higher-order' oscillations forming an intricate pattern with\nsaddle-point-like features.\n", "  We investigate the deflection of light by a rotating global monopole\nspacetime and a rotating Letelier spacetime in the weak deflection\napproximation. To this end, we apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to the\ncorresponding osculating optical geometries and show that the deflection of\nlight increases due to the presence of the global monopole parameter and the\nstring cloud parameter, respectively. The results obtained for the deflection\nangle in the equatorial plane generalize known results for the corresponding\nnon-rotating global monopole and Letelier spacetimes as well as the Kerr\nsolution.\n", "  We calculate radiative corrections to the quark quasidistribution in lattice\nperturbation theory at one loop to leading orders in the lattice spacing. We\nalso consider one-loop corrections in continuum Euclidean space. We find the\ninfrared behavior of the corrections in Euclidean and Minkowski space are\ndifferent. We explore features of momentum loop integrals and demonstrate why\nloop corrections from the lattice perturbation theory and Euclidean continuum\ndo not correspond with their Minkowski brethren, and comment on a recent\nsuggestion for transcending the differences in the results. Further, we examine\nthe role of the lattice spacing $a$ and of the $r$ parameter in the Wilson\naction in these radiative corrections.\n", "  The time-dependent generator coordinate method with the gaussian overlap\napproximation (TDGCM+GOA) formalism is applied to describe the fission of\n$^{252}$Cf. We perform analysis of fission from the initial states laying in\nthe energetic range from the ground state to the state located 4 MeV above the\nfission barrier. The fission fragment mass distributions, obtained for\ndifferent parity, energy of levels and types of mixed states, are calculated\nand compared with experimental data. The impact of the total time of wave\npacket propagation on the final results is studied as well. The weak dependence\nof obtained mass yields on the initial conditions is shown.\n", "  In kinetic theory, a system is usually described by its one-particle\ndistribution function $f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t)$, such that\n$f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t)d\\mathbf{r} d\\mathbf{v}$ is the fraction of\nparticles with positions and velocities in the intervals $(\\mathbf{r},\n\\mathbf{r}+d\\mathbf{r})$ and $(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{v}+d\\mathbf{v})$,\nrespectively. Therein, global stability and the possible existence of an\nassociated Lyapunov function or $H$-theorem are open problems when\nnon-conservative interactions are present, as in granular fluids. Here, we\naddress this issue in the framework of a lattice model for granular-like\nvelocity fields. For a quite general driving mechanism, including both boundary\nand bulk driving, we show that the steady state reached by the system in the\nlong time limit is globally stable. This is done by proving analytically that a\ncertain $H$-functional is non-increasing in the long time limit. Moreover, for\ntwo specific energy injection mechanisms, we are able to demonstrate that the\nproposed $H$-functional is non-increasing for all times. Also, we put forward a\nproof that clearly illustrates why the \"classical\" Boltzmann functional\n$H_{B}[f]=\\int\\! d\\mathbf{r} \\, d\\mathbf{v} f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t) \\ln\nf(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t)$ is inadequate for systems with non-conservative\ninteractions. Not only is this done for the simplified kinetic description that\nholds in the lattice models analysed here but also for a general kinetic\nequation, like Boltzmann's or Enskog's.\n", "  We use Gaia-ESO Survey iDR4 data to explore the Mg-Al anti-correlation in\nglobular clusters, that were observed as calibrators, as a demonstration of the\nquality of Gaia-ESO Survey data and analysis. The results compare well with the\navailable literature, within 0.1 dex or less, after a small (compared to the\ninternal spreads) offset between the UVES and the GIRAFFE data of 0.10-0.15 dex\nwas taken into account. In particular, we present for the first time data for\nNGC 5927, one of the most metal-rich globular clusters studied in the\nliterature so far with [Fe/H]=-0.49 dex, that was included to connect with the\nopen cluster regime in the Gaia-ESO Survey internal calibration. The extent and\nshape of the Mg-Al anti-correlation provide strong constraints on the multiple\npopulation phenomenon in globular clusters. In particular, we studied the\ndependency of the Mg-Al anti-correlation extension with metallicity,\npresent-day mass, and age of the clusters, using GES data in combination with a\nlarge set of homogenized literature measurements. We find a dependency with\nboth metallicity and mass, that is evident when fitting for the two parameters\nsimultaneously, but no significant dependency with age. We confirm that the\nMg-Al anti-correlation is not seen in all clusters, but disappears for the less\nmassive or most metal-rich ones. We also use our dataset to see whether a\nnormal anti-correlation would explain the low [Mg/$\\alpha$] observed in some\nextragalactic globular clusters, but find that none of the clusters in our\nsample can reproduce it, and more extreme chemical compositions (like the one\nof NGC 2419) would be required. We conclude that GES iDR4 data already meet the\nrequirements set by the main survey goals, and can be used to study in detail\nglobular clusters even if the analysis procedures were not specifically\ndesigned for them.\n", "  In the context of quantum tomography, quantities called a partial\ndeterminants\\cite{jackson2015detecting} were recently introduced. PDs (partial\ndeterminants) are explicit functions of the collected data which are sensitive\nto the presence of state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) correlations. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate further applications of the PD and its\ngeneralizations. In particular we construct methods for detecting various types\nof SPAM correlation in multiqudit systems | e.g. measurement-measurement\ncorrelations. The relationship between the PDs of each method and the\ncorrelations they are sensitive to is topological. We give a complete\nclassification scheme for all such methods but focus on the explicit details of\nonly the most scalable methods, for which the number of settings scale as\n$\\mathcal{O}(d^4)$. This paper is the second of a two part series where the\nfirst paper[2] is about theoretical perspectives of the PD and its\ninterpretation as a holonomy.\n", "  Employing a 10-orbital tight binding model, we present a new set of hopping\nparameters fitted directly to our latest high resolution angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data for the high temperature tetragonal\nphase of FeSe. Using these parameters we predict a large 10 meV shift of the\nchemical potential as a function of temperature. In order to confirm this large\ntemperature dependence, we performed ARPES experiments on FeSe and observed a\n$\\sim$25 meV rigid shift to the chemical potential between 100 K and 300 K.\nThis unexpectedly strong shift has important implications for theoretical\nmodels of superconductivity and of nematic order in FeSe materials.\n", "  We study quantum spin Hall insulators with local Coulomb interactions in the\npresence of boundaries using dynamical mean field theory. We investigate the\ndifferent influence of the Coulomb interaction on the bulk and the edge states.\nInterestingly, we discover an edge reconstruction driven by electronic\ncorrelations. The reason is that the helical edge states experience Mott\nlocalization for an interaction strength smaller than the bulk one. We argue\nthat the significance of this edge reconstruction can be understood by\ntopological properties of the system characterized by a local Chern marker.\n", "  We present the first detection of the nearby (z=0.084) low-luminosity BL Lac\nobject 1ES 1741+196 in the very high energy (VHE: E$>$100 GeV) band. This\nobject lies in a triplet of interacting galaxies. Early predictions had\nsuggested 1ES 1741+196 to be, along with several other high-frequency BL Lac\nsources, within the reach of MAGIC detectability. Its detection by MAGIC, later\nconfirmed by VERITAS, helps to expand the small population of known TeV BL\nLacs. The source was observed with the MAGIC telescopes between 2010 April and\n2011 May, collecting 46 h of good quality data. These observations led to the\ndetection of the source at 6.0 $\\sigma$ confidence level, with a steady flux\n$\\mathrm{F}(> 100 {\\rm GeV}) = (6.4 \\pm 1.7_{\\mathrm{stat}}\\pm\n2.6_{\\mathrm{syst}}) \\cdot 10^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and a differential\nspectral photon index $\\Gamma = 2.4 \\pm 0.2_{\\mathrm{stat}} \\pm\n0.2_{\\mathrm{syst}}$ in the range of $\\sim$80 GeV - 3 TeV. To study the\nbroad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) simultaneous with MAGIC\nobservations, we use KVA, Swift/UVOT and XRT, and Fermi/LAT data. One-zone\nsynchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) modeling of the SED of 1ES 1741+196 suggests\nvalues for the SSC parameters that are quite common among known TeV BL Lacs\nexcept for a relatively low Doppler factor and slope of electron energy\ndistribution. A thermal feature seen in the SED is well matched by a giant\nelliptical's template. This appears to be the signature of thermal emission\nfrom the host galaxy, which is clearly resolved in optical observations.\n", "  Based on the experimental data released recently by the CLAS Collaboration,\nthe $f_{1}(1285)$ photoproduction off a proton target is investigated in an\neffective Lagrangian approach. In our model, $s$-channel, $u$-channel, and\n$t$-channel Born terms are included to calculate the differential cross\nsections, which are compared with the recent CLAS experiment. An interpolating\nReggeized treatment is applied to the $t$ channel, and it is found that the\n$t$-channel contribution is dominant in the $f_1(1285)$ photoproduction and the\n$u$-channel contribution is responsible for the enhancement at backward angles.\nThe present calculation does not take into account any explicit $s$-channel\nnucleon-resonance contribution; nevertheless, our model provides a good\ndescription of the main features of the data. It suggests small couplings of\nthe $f_1(1285)$ and the nucleon resonances in this energy region.\n", "  We present a thermodynamically consistent method by which equations of state\nbased on nonrelativistic potential models can be modified so that they respect\ncausality at high densities, both at zero and finite temperature (entropy). We\nillustrate the application of the method using the high density phase\nparametrization of the well known APR model in its pure neutron matter\nconfiguration as an example. We also show that, for models with only contact\ninteractions, the adiabatic speed of sound is independent of the temperature in\nthe limit of very large temperature. This feature is approximately valid for\nmodels with finite-range interactions as well, insofar as the temperature\ndependence they introduce to the Landau effective mass is weak. In addition,\nour study reveals that in first principle nonrelativistic models of hot and\ndense matter, contributions from higher than two-body interactions must be\nscreened at high density to preserve causality.\n", "  Context. GX 1+4 belongs to a rare class of X-ray binaries with red giant\ndonors, symbiotic X-ray binaries. The system has a history of complicated\nvariability on multiple timescales in the optical light and X-rays. The nature\nof this variability remains poorly understood. Aims. We study variability of GX\n1+4 on long time-scale in X-ray and optical bands. Methods. The presented X-ray\nobservations are from INTEGRAL Soft Gamma-Ray Imager and RXTE All Sky Monitor.\nThe optical observations are from INTEGRAL Optical Monitoring Camera. Results.\nThe variability of GX 1+4 both in optical light and hard X-ray emission (>17\nkeV) is dominated by ~50-70d quasi-periodic changes. The amplitude of this\nvariability is highest during the periastron passage, while during the\npotential neutron star eclipse the system is always at minimum, which confirms\nthe 1161d orbital period that has had been proposed for the system based on\nradial velocity curve. Neither the quasi-periodic variability or the orbital\nperiod are detected in soft X-ray emission (1.3-12.2 keV), where the binary\nshows no apparent periodicity.\n", "  The data from all observations of RX J0720.4-3125 conducted by XMM-Newton\nEPIC-pn with the same instrumental setup in 2000-2012 were reprocessed to form\na homogenous data set of solar barycenter corrected photon arrival times\nregistered from RX J0720.4-3125. A Bayesian method for the search, detection,\nand estimation of the parameters of an unknown-shaped periodic signal was\nemployed as developed by Gregory & Loredo (1992).\n  A number of complex models (single and double peaked) of light curves from\npulsating neutron stars were statistically analyzed. The distribution of phases\nfor the registered photons was calculated by folding the arrival times with the\nderived spin-period and the resulting distribution of phases approximated with\na mixed von Mises distribution, and its parameters were estimated by using the\nExpected Maximization method. Spin phase-resolved spectra were extracted, and a\nnumber of highly magnetized atmosphere models of an INS were used to fit\nsimultaneously, the results were verified via an MCMC approach. The\nphase-folded light curves in different energy bands with high S/N ratio show a\nhigh complexity and variations depending on time and energy.\n  They can be parameterized with a mixed von Mises distribution, i.e. with\ndouble-peaked light curve profile showing a dependence of the estimated\nparameters (mean directions, concentrations, and proportion) upon the energy\nband, indicating that radiation emerges from at least two emitting areas.\n  The genuine spin-period of the isolated neutron star RX J0720-3125 derived as\nmore likely is twice of that reported in the literature (16.78s instead of\n8.39s).\n  The gravitational redshift of RX J0720.4-3125 was determined to\n$z=0.205_{-0.003}^{+0.006}$ and the compactness was estimated to\n$(M/M_{Sun})/R(km)=0.105 \\pm 0.002 $.\n", "  Influencing various aspects of human activity, migration is associated also\nwith language formation. To examine the mutual interaction of these processes,\nwe study a Naming Game with migrating agents. The dynamics of the model leads\nto formation of low-mobility clusters, which turns out to break the symmetry of\nthe model: although the Naming Game remains symmetric, low-mobility languages\nare favoured. High-mobility languages are gradually eliminated from the system\nand the dynamics of language formation considerably slows down. Our model is\ntoo simple to explain in detail language competition of migrating human\ncommunities, but it certainly shows that languages of settlers are favoured\nover nomadic ones.\n", "  The Nambu Jona-Lasinio model of chiral symmetry breaking predicts a second\norder chiral phase transition. If the fermions in addition have non-abelian\ngauge interactions then the transition is expected to become a crossover as the\nNJL term enhances the IR chiral symmetry breaking of the gauge theory. We study\nthis behaviour in the holographic Dynamic AdS/QCD description of a non-abelian\ngauge theory with the NJL interaction included using Witten's multi-trace\nprescription. We study the behaviour of the mesonic spectrum as a function of\nthe NJL coupling and the ratio of the UV cut off scale to the dynamical scale\nof the gauge theory.\n", "  We consider the photon-assisted tunneling (PAT) and the\nLandau-Zener-Stueckelberg (LZS) interference for double quantum dots induced\nelectrostatically along a semiconducting carbon nanotube. An atomistic\ntight-binding approach and the time-dependent configuration interaction method\nare employed for description of the systems of a few confined electrons and\nholes. We reproduce the patterns of the LZS interference recently observed for\nthe quantum double dots describing transport across hole-localized states.\nMoreover, we indicate that for charge configurations for which the ground-state\nis Pauli blocked PAT can be used for resolution of the transitions that involve\nspin-flip or intervalley transitions without the spin-valley conserving\nbackground signal.\n", "  The history of the dark matter problem can be traced back to at least the\n1930s, but it was not until the early 1970s that the issue of 'missing matter'\nwas widely recognized as problematic. In the latter period, previously separate\nissues involving missing mass were brought together in a single anomaly. We\nargue that reference to a straightforward 'accumulation of evidence' alone is\ninadequate to comprehend this episode. Rather, the rise of cosmological\nresearch, the accompanying renewed interest in the theory of relativity and\nchanges in the manpower division of astronomy in the 1960s are key to\nunderstanding how dark matter came to matter. At the same time, this story may\nalso enlighten us on the methodological dimensions of past practices of physics\nand cosmology.\n", "  We simulate the creation and evolution of non-boost-invariant Glasma in the\nearly stages of heavy ion collisions within the color glass condensate\nframework. This is accomplished by extending the McLerran-Venugopalan model to\ninclude a parameter for the Lorentz-contracted but finite width of the nucleus\nin the beam direction. We determine the rapidity profile of the Glasma energy\ndensity, which shows deviations from the boost-invariant result. Varying the\nparameters both broad and narrow profiles can be produced. We compare our\nresults to experimental data from RHIC and find surprising agreement.\n", "  We examine the shape of droplets atop deformable thin elastomeric films\nprepared with an anisotropic tension. As the droplets generate a deformation in\nthe taut film through capillary forces, they assume a shape that is elongated\nalong the high tension direction. By measuring the contact line profile, the\ntension in the membrane can be completely determined. Minimal theoretical\narguments lead to predictions for the droplet shape and membrane deformation\nthat are in excellent agreement with the data. On the whole, the results\ndemonstrate that droplets can be used as probes to map out the stress field in\na membrane.\n", "  Bumblebee models are effective field theories describing a vector field with\na nonzero vacuum expectation value that spontaneously breaks Lorentz\ninvariance. They provide an alternative way of exploring the similarities\nbetween theories with spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking and gauge theories.\nThe equivalence between bumblebee models with suitable conditions and standard\nelectrodynamics in a non-linear gauge $A_\\mu A^\\mu-b^2=0$ is taken for granted;\nhowever, this point is very subtle and has not yet been fully addressed. The\nmain goal of this paper is to fill in this gap. More precisely, here we study\nthe relation between a bumblebee model, with a smooth potential of the form\n$V(B _{\\mu}) = V (B _{\\mu} B ^{\\mu} - b ^{2})$, and standard electrodynamics in\nthe non-linear gauge $A _{\\mu} A ^{\\mu} - b ^{2} = 0$, both at the classical\nand quantum levels. Using the Dirac's method we show that after introducing\nDirac brackets with suitable initial conditions, the classical dynamics of the\nbumblebee model corresponds to that of standard electrodynamics in the\naforementioned non-linear gauge. In the quantum case we demonstrate that\nperturbative calculations of Feynman amplitudes to any physical process in each\nmodel are indistinguishable. To do this, we show that the Feynman rules and\npropagators of standard electrodynamics in the non-linear gauge and those\ndescribing the bumblebee model are the same.\n", "  In the Fock representation, we propose a framework to construct the\ngeneralized matrix product states (MPS) for topological phases with $\\mathbb{\nZ}_{p}$ parafermions. Unlike the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Majorana fermions, the $%\n\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ parafermions form intrinsically interacting systems. Here we\nexplicitly construct two topologically distinct classes of irreducible $%\n\\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ parafermionic MPS wave functions, characterized by one or two\nparafermionic zero modes at each end of an open chain. Their corresponding\nparent Hamiltonians are found as the fixed point models of the single\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ parafermion chain and two-coupled parafermion chains with\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{3}\\times \\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ symmetry. Our results thus pave the road\nto investigate all possible topological phases with $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$\nparafermions within the matrix product representation in one dimension.\n", "  In a conformational nonequilibrium steady state (cNESS), enzyme turnover is\nmodulated by the underlying conformational dynamics. Based on a discrete\nkinetic network model, we use the integrated probability flux balance method to\nderive the cNESS turnover rate for a conformation-modulated enzymatic reaction.\nThe traditional Michaelis-Menten (MM) rate equation is extended to a\ngeneralized form, which includes non-MM corrections induced by conformational\npopulation currents within combined cyclic kinetic loops. When conformational\ndetailed balance is satisfied, the turnover rate reduces to the MM functional\nform, explaining its validity for many enzymatic systems. For the first time, a\none-to-one correspondence is established between non-MM terms and combined\ncyclic loops with unbalanced conformational currents. Cooperativity resulting\nfrom nonequilibrium conformational dynamics has been observed in enzymatic\nreactions, and we provide a novel, rigorous means of predicting and\ncharacterizing such behavior. Our generalized MM equation affords a systematic\napproach for exploring cNESS enzyme kinetics.\n", "  The step-wise growth of epitaxial Fe on Cu(001)/Si(001), investigated by\nin-situ polarized neutron reflectometry is presented. A sputter deposition\nsystem was integrated into the neutron reflectometer AMOR at the Swiss neutron\nspallation source SINQ, which enables the analysis of the microstructure and\nmagnetic moments during all deposition steps of the Fe layer. We report on the\nprogressive evolution of the accessible parameters describing the\nmicrostructure and the magnetic properties of the Fe film, which reproduce\nknown features and extend our knowledge on the behavior of ultrathin iron\nfilms.\n", "  In astrophysical systems with partially ionized plasma the motion of ions is\ngoverned by the magnetic field while the neutral particles can only feel the\nmagnetic field's Lorentz force indirectly through collisions with ions. The\ndrift in the velocity between ionized and neutral species plays a key role in\nmodifying important physical processes like magnetic reconnection, damping of\nmagnetohydrodynamic waves, transport of angular momentum in plasma through the\nmagnetic field, and heating. This paper investigates the differences between\nDoppler velocities of calcium ions and neutral hydrogen in a solar prominence\nto look for velocity differences between the neutral and ionized species. We\nsimultaneously observed spectra of a prominence over an active region in H I\n397 nm, H I 434 nm, Ca II 397 nm, and Ca II 854 nm using a high dispersion\nspectrograph of the Domeless Solar Telescope at Hida observatory, and compared\nthe Doppler velocities, derived from the shift of the peak of the spectral\nlines presumably emitted from optically-thin plasma. There are instances when\nthe difference in velocities between neutral atoms and ions is significant,\ne.g. 1433 events (~ 3 % of sets of compared profiles) with a difference in\nvelocity between neutral hydrogen atoms and calcium ions greater than 3sigma of\nthe measurement error. However, we also found significant differences between\nthe Doppler velocities of two spectral lines emitted from the same species, and\nthe probability density functions of velocity difference between the same\nspecies is not significantly different from those between neutral atoms and\nions. We interpreted the difference of Doppler velocities as a result of\nmotions of different components in the prominence along the line of sight,\nrather than the decoupling of neutral atoms from plasma.\n", "  Assembling different two-dimensional (2D) crystals, covering a very broad\nrange of properties, into van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures enables the\nunprecedented possibilities for combining the best of different ingredients in\none objective material. So far, metallic, semiconducting, and insulating 2D\ncrystals have been used successfully in making functional vdW heterostructures\nwith properties by design. Here, we expand 2D superconducting crystals as a\nbuilding block of the vdW hererostructures. A one-step growth of large-scale\nhigh-quality vdW heterostructures of graphene and 2D superconducting a-Mo2C by\nusing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is reported. The superconductivity\nand its 2D nature of the heterostructures are characterized by our scanning\ntunneling microscopy (STM) measurements. This adds the 2D superconductivity,\nthe most attractive property of condensed matter physics, to the vdW\nheterostructures.\n", "  We study the global stability of a self-gravitating disk in the context of\nModified Gravity (MOG) using N-body simulations. This theory is a relativistic\nscalar-tensor-vector theory of gravity and presented to address the dark matter\nproblem. In the weak field limit MOG possesses two free parameters $\\alpha$ and\n$\\mu_0$ which have been already determined using rotation curve data of spiral\ngalaxies. The evolution of a stellar self-gravitating disk and more\nspecifically the bar instability in MOG is investigated and compared to a\nNewtonian case. Our models have exponential and Mestel-like surface densities\nas $\\Sigma\\propto \\exp(-r/h)$ and $\\Sigma\\propto 1/r$. It is found out that,\nsurprisingly, the disks are more stable against the bar mode in MOG than in\nNewtonian gravity. In other words, the bar growth rate is effectively slower\nthan the Newtonian disks. Also we show that both free parameters, i.e. $\\alpha$\nand $\\mu_0$, have stabilizing effects. In other words, increase in these\nparameters will decrease the bar growth rate.\n", "  Paying attention to conformal invariance as the invariance under local\ntransformations of units of measure, we take a conformal invariant quantum\nfield as a quantum matter theory in which one has the freedom to choose the\nvalues of units of mass, length and time arbitrarily at each point. To be able\nto have this view, it is necessary that the background on which the quantum\nfield is based be conformal invariant as well. Consequently, defining the\nunambiguous expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of such a quantum\nfield through the Wald renormalizing prescription necessitates breaking down\nthe conformal symmetry of the background. Then, noticing the field equations\nsuitable for describing the back-reaction effect, we show that the existence of\ntrace anomaly, known for indicating the brokenness of conformal symmetry in\nquantum field theory, can also indicate the above gravitational conformal\nsymmetry brokenness\n", "  The baryon electromagnetic form factors are expressed in terms of\ntwo-dimensional densities describing the distribution of charge and\nmagnetization in transverse space at fixed light-front time. We calculate the\ntransverse densities of the spin-1/2 flavor-octet baryons at peripheral\ndistances b = O(M_\\pi^{-1}) using methods of relativistic chiral effective\nfield theory (\\chi EFT) and dispersion analysis. The densities are represented\nas dispersive integrals over the imaginary parts of the form factors in the\ntimelike region (spectral functions). The isovector spectral functions on the\ntwo-pion cut t > 4 M_\\pi^2 are calculated using relativistic \\chi EFT including\noctet and decuplet baryons. The \\chi EFT calculations are extended into the\n\\rho meson mass region using an N/D method that incorporates the pion\nelectromagnetic form factor data. The isoscalar spectral functions are modeled\nby vector meson poles. We compute the peripheral charge and magnetization\ndensities in the octet baryon states, estimate the uncertainties, and determine\nthe quark flavor decomposition. The approach can be extended to baryon form\nfactors of other operators and the moments of generalized parton distributions.\n", "  We present a systematic derivation of relativistic lattice kinetic equations\nfor finite-mass particles, reaching close to the zero-mass ultra-relativistic\nregime treated in the previous literature. Starting from an expansion of the\nMaxwell-Juettner distribution on orthogonal polynomials, we perform a\nGauss-type quadrature procedure and discretize the relativistic Boltzmann\nequation on space-filling Cartesian lattices. The model is validated through\nnumerical comparison with standard benchmark tests and solvers in relativistic\nfluid dynamics such as Boltzmann approach multiparton scattering (BAMPS) and\nprevious relativistic lattice Boltzmann models. This work provides a\nsignificant step towards the formulation of a unified relativistic lattice\nkinetic scheme, covering both massive and near-massless particles regimes.\n", "  We investigate the effect of the redshift drift in strong gravitational\nlensing. The redshift drift produces a time variation of $i)$ the apparent\nposition of a lensed source and $ii)$ the time delay among incoming signals\nfrom different images. We dub these effects as angular drift and time delay\ndrift, respectively, and analyze their relevance in cosmology.\n", "  Phase-mixing of Alfv\\'en waves in the solar corona has been identified as one\npossible candidate to explain coronal heating. While this scenario is supported\nby observations of ubiquitous oscillations in the corona carrying sufficient\nwave energy and by theoretical models that have described the concentration of\nenergy in small scale structures, it is still unclear whether this wave energy\ncan maintain the million degree solar corona. The aim of this work is to assess\nhow much energy can be converted by a phase-mixing process triggered by the\npropagation of Alfv\\'enic waves in a cylindric coronal structure, such as a\ncoronal loop, and to estimate the impact on the coronal heating. To this end,\nwe run 3D MHD simulations of a magnetised cylinder where the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries through a boundary shell and a footpoint driver is set to trigger kink\nmodes which mode couple to torsional Alfv\\'en modes in the boundary shell.\nThese Alfv\\'en waves are expected to phase-mix and the system allows us to\nstudy the subsequent thermal energy deposition. We run a reference simulation\nto explain the main process and then we vary simulation parameters. When we\ntake into consideration high values of magnetic resistivity and strong\nfootpoint drivers, we find i) that phase-mixing leads to a temperature increase\nof the order of $10^5$ K or less, depending on the structure of the boundary\nshell, ii) that this energy is able to balance the radiative losses only in the\nlocalised region involved in the heating, iii) and how the boundary layer and\nthe persistence of the driver influence the thermal structure of the system.\nOur conclusion is that due to the extreme physical parameters we adopted and\nthe moderate impact on the heating of the system, it is unlikely that\nphase-mixing can contribute on a global scale to the heating of the solar\ncorona.\n", "  We present a non-perturbative analysis of the power-spectrum of energy level\nfluctuations in fully chaotic quantum structures. Focussing on systems with\nbroken time-reversal symmetry, we employ a finite-$N$ random matrix theory to\nderive an exact multidimensional integral representation of the power-spectrum.\nThe $N\\rightarrow \\infty$ limit of the exact solution furnishes the main result\nof this study -- a universal, parameter-free prediction for the power-spectrum\nexpressed in terms of a fifth Painlev\\'e transcendent. Extensive numerics lends\nfurther support to our theory which, as discussed at length, invalidates a\ntraditional assumption that the power-spectrum is merely determined by the\nspectral form factor of a quantum system.\n", "  Space photometric time series of the most massive members of the young open\ncluster NGC 2264 allow us to study their different sources of variability down\nto the millimagnitude level and permits a search for Slowly Pulsating B (SPB)\ntype pulsation among objects that are only a few million years old. Our goal is\nto conduct a homogeneous study of young B type stars in the cluster NGC 2264\nusing photometric time series from space in combination with high-resolution\nspectroscopy and spectropolarimetry obtained from the ground. The latter will\nbe presented in a separate follow-up article. We performed frequency analyses\nfor eleven B stars in the field of the young cluster NGC 2264 using photometric\ntime series from the MOST, CoRoT and Spitzer space telescopes and the routines\nPeriod04 and SigSpec. We employ the MESA stellar evolution code in combination\nwith the oscillation code GYRE to identify the pulsation modes for two SPB\nstars which exhibit short period spacing series. From our analysis we identify\nfour objects that show SPB pulsations, five stars that show rotational\nmodulation of their light curves caused by spots, one star that is identified\nto be a binary, and one object in the field of the cluster that is found to be\na non-member Be star. In two SPB stars we detect a number of regularly spaced\npulsation modes that are compatible with being members of a g mode period\nseries. Despite NGC 2264's young age, our analysis illustrates that its B type\nmembers have already arrived on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). Our\nasteroseismic analysis yields masses between 4 and 6 Msun and ages between 1\nand 6 million years, which agree well to the overall cluster age.\n", "  An analytical discontinuity is reported in what was thought to be the\ndiscontinuity-free exact nonparaxial vortex beam phasor obtained within the\ncomplex source/sink model. This discontinuity appears for all odd values of the\norbital angular momentum mode. Such discontinuities in the phasor lead to\nnonphysical discontinuities in the real electromagnetic field components. We\nidentify the source of the discontinuities, and provide graphical evidence of\nthe discontinuous real electric fields for the first and third orbital angular\nmomentum modes. A simple means of avoiding these discontinuities is presented.\n", "  Increasing interest in energetic particle effects on weather and climate has\nmotivated development of a miniature scintillator-based detector intended for\ndeployment on meteorological radiosondes or unmanned airborne vehicles. The\ndetector was calibrated with laboratory gamma sources up to 1.3 MeV, and known\ngamma peaks from natural radioactivity of up to 2.6 MeV. The specifications of\nour device in combination with the performance of similar devices suggest that\nit will respond to up to 17 MeV gamma rays. Laboratory tests show the detector\ncan measure muons at the surface, and it is also expected to respond to other\nionizing radiation including, for example, protons, electrons (>100 keV) and\nenergetic helium nuclei from cosmic rays or during space weather events. Its\nestimated counting error is about 10%. Recent tests, when the detector was\nintegrated with a meteorological radiosonde system, and carried on a balloon to\n~25 km altitude, identified the transition region between energetic particles\nnear the surface, which are dominated by terrestrial gamma emissions, to\nhigher-energy particles in the free troposphere.\n", "  Aims. We investigate the effect of chemistry on the stability of starless\ncores against gravitational collapse.\n  Methods. We combine chemical and radiative transfer simulations in the\ncontext of a modified Bonnor-Ebert sphere to model the effect of chemistry on\nthe gas temperature, and study the effect of temperature changes on core\nstability.\n  Results. We find that chemistry has in general very little effect on the\nnondimensional radius $\\xi_{\\rm out}$ which parametrizes the core stability.\nCores that are initially stable or unstable tend to stay near their initial\nstates, in terms of stability (i.e., $\\xi_{\\rm out} \\sim$ constant), as the\nchemistry develops. This result is independent of the initial conditions. We\ncan however find solutions where $\\xi_{\\rm out}$ decreases at late times ($t\n\\gtrsim 10^6 \\, \\rm yr$) which correspond to increased stabilization caused by\nthe chemistry. Even though the core stability is unchanged by the chemistry in\nmost of the models considered here, we cannot rule out the possibility that a\ncore can evolve from an unstable to a stable state owing to chemical evolution.\nThe reverse case, where an initially stable core becomes ultimately unstable,\nseems highly unlikely.\n  Conclusions. Our results indicate that chemistry should be properly accounted\nfor in studies of star-forming regions, and that further investigations of core\nstability especially with hydrodynamical models are warranted.\n", "  We investigate time-dependent spherically symmetric solutions of the\nfour-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-axion-dilaton system, with the dilaton\ncoupling that occurs in low-energy effective heterotic string theory. A class\nof dilaton-electrovacuum radiating solutions with a trivial axion, previously\nfound by G\\\"uven and Y\\\"or\\\"uk, is re-derived in a simpler manner and its\ncausal structure is clarified. It is shown that such dynamical spacetimes\nfeaturing apparent horizons do not possess a regular light-like past null\ninfinity or future null infinity, depending on whether they are radiating or\naccreting. These solutions are then extended in two ways. First we consider a\nVaidya-like generalisation, which introduces a null dust source. Such\nspacetimes are used to test the status of cosmic censorship in the context of\nlow-energy string theory. We prove that - within this family of solutions -\nregular black holes cannot evolve into naked singularities by accreting null\ndust, unless standard energy conditions are violated. Secondly, we employ\nS-duality to derive new time-dependent dyon solutions with a nontrivial axion\nturned on. Although they share the same causal structure as their\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton counterparts, these solutions possess both electric\nand magnetic charges.\n", "  The Jeans analysis is studied in the first post-Newtonian limit. In other\nwords, the relativistic effects on the local gravitational instability are\nconsidered for systems where characteristic velocity of the system and\ncorresponding gravitational field are higher than what permitted in Newtonian\nlimit. The dispersion relation for propagation of small perturbations is found\nin the post-Newtonian approximation using two different techniques. A new Jeans\nmass is derived and compared to the standard Jeans mass. In this limit, the\nrelativistic effects make the new Jeans mass to be smaller than the Newtonian\nJeans mass. Furthermore, the fractional difference between these two masses\nincreases when temperature/pressure of the system increases. Interestingly, in\nthis limit pressure can help the gravitational instability instead of\npreventing it. Finally the results are applied to high temperature\nastrophysical systems and the possibility of local fragmentations in some\nrelativistic systems is investigated.\n", "  Measurements of $D^{*}(2010)$ meson production in diffractive deep inelastic\nscattering $(5<Q^{2}<100~{\\rm GeV}^{2})$ are presented which are based on HERA\ndata recorded at a centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s} = 319{\\rm~GeV}$ with an\nintegrated luminosity of $287$ pb$^{-1}$. The reaction $ep \\rightarrow eXY$ is\nstudied, where the system $X$, containing at least one $D^{*}(2010)$ meson, is\nseparated from a leading low-mass proton dissociative system $Y$ by a large\nrapidity gap. The kinematics of $D^{*}$ candidates are reconstructed in the\n$D^{*}\\rightarrow K \\pi\\pi$ decay channel. The measured cross sections compare\nfavourably with next-to-leading order QCD predictions, where charm quarks are\nproduced via boson-gluon fusion. The charm quarks are then independently\nfragmented to the $D^{*}$ mesons. The calculations rely on the collinear\nfactorisation theorem and are based on diffractive parton densities previously\nobtained by H1 from fits to inclusive diffractive cross sections. The data are\nfurther used to determine the diffractive to inclusive $D^{*}$ production ratio\nin deep inelastic scattering.\n", "  We study the diffusion of a Brownian probe particle of size $R$ in a dilute\ndispersion of active Brownian particles (ABPs) of size $a$, characteristic swim\nspeed $U_0$, reorientation time $\\tau_R$, and mechanical energy $k_s T_s =\n\\zeta_a U_0^2 \\tau_R /6$, where $\\zeta_a$ is the Stokes drag coefficient of a\nswimmer. The probe has a thermal diffusivity $D_P = k_B T/\\zeta_P$, where $k_B\nT$ is the thermal energy of the solvent and $\\zeta_P$ is the Stokes drag\ncoefficient for the probe. When the swimmers are inactive, collisions between\nthe probe and the swimmers sterically hinder the probe's diffusive motion. In\ncompetition with this steric hindrance is an enhancement driven by the activity\nof the swimmers. The strength of swimming relative to thermal diffusion is set\nby $Pe_s = U_0 a /D_P$. The active contribution to the diffusivity scales as\n$Pe_s^2$ for weak swimming and $Pe_s$ for strong swimming, but the transition\nbetween these two regimes is nonmonotonic. When fluctuations in the probe\nmotion decay on the time scale $\\tau_R$, the active diffusivity scales as $k_s\nT_s /\\zeta_P$: the probe moves as if it were immersed in a solvent with energy\n$k_s T_s$ rather than $k_B T$.\n", "  The discovery of clear criteria that can deterministically describe the\neruptive state of a solar active region would lead to major improvements on\nspace weather predictions. Using series of numerical simulations of the\nemergence of a magnetic flux rope in a magnetized coronal, leading either to\neruptions or to stable configurations, we test several global scalar quantities\nfor the ability to discriminate between the eruptive and the non-eruptive\nsimulations. From the magnetic field generated by the three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulations, we compute and analyse the evolution of the\nmagnetic flux, of the magnetic energy and its decomposition into potential and\nfree energies, and of the relative magnetic helicity and its decomposition.\nUnlike the magnetic flux and magnetic energies, magnetic helicities are able to\nmarkedly distinguish the eruptive from the non-eruptive simulations. We find\nthat the ratio of the magnetic helicity of the current-carrying magnetic field\nto the total relative helicity presents the highest values for the eruptive\nsimulations, in the pre-eruptive phase only. We observe that the eruptive\nsimulations do not possess the highest value of total magnetic helicity. In the\nframework of our numerical study, the magnetic energies and the total relative\nhelicity do not correspond to good eruptivity proxies. Our study highlights\nthat the ratio of magnetic helicities diagnoses very clearly the eruptive\npotential of our parametric simulations. Our study shows that\nmagnetic-helicity-based quantities may be very efficient for the prediction of\nsolar eruptions.\n", "  Although extensive experimental and theoretical works have been conducted to\nunderstand the ballistic and diffusive phonon transport in nanomaterials\nrecently, direct observation of temperature and thermal nonequilibrium of\ndifferent phonon modes has not been realized. Herein, we have developed a\nmethod within the framework of molecular dynamics to calculate the temperatures\nof phonon in both real and phase spaces. Taking silicon thin film and graphene\nas examples, we directly obtained the spectral phonon temperature (SPT) and\nobserved the local thermal nonequilibrium between the ballistic and diffusive\nphonons. Such nonequilibrium also generally exists across interfaces and is\nsurprisingly large, and it provides an additional thermal interfacial\nresistance mechanism. Our SPT results directly show that the vertical thermal\ntransport across the dimensionally mismatched graphene/substrate interface is\nthrough the coupling between flexural acoustic phonons of graphene and the\nlongitudinal phonons in the substrate with mode conversion. In the\ndimensionally matched interfaces, e.g. graphene/graphene junction and\ngraphene/boron nitride planar interfaces, strong coupling occurs between the\nacoustic phonon modes on both sides, and the coupling decreases with\ninterfacial mixing. The SPT method together with the spectral heat flux can\neliminate the size effect of the thermal conductivity prediction induced from\nballistic transport. Our work shows that in thin films and across interfaces,\nphonons are in local thermal nonequilibrium.\n", "  The nature of coarse graining is intuitively \"obvious\", but it is rather\ndifficult to find explicit and calculable models of the coarse graining process\n(and the resulting entropy flow) discussed in the literature. What we would\nlike to have at hand is some explicit and calculable process that takes an\narbitrary system, with specified initial entropy S, and monotonically and\ncontrollably drives the entropy to its maximum value. This does not have to be\na physical process, in fact for some purposes it is better to deal with a\ngedanken-process, since then it is more obvious how the \"hidden information\" is\nhiding in the fine-grain correlations that one is simply agreeing not to look\nat. We shall present several simple mathematically well-defined and easy to\nwork with conceptual models for coarse graining. We shall consider both the\nclassical Shannon and quantum von Neumann entropies, including models based on\nquantum decoherence, and analyze the entropy flow in some detail. When\ncoarse-graining the quantum von Neumann entropy, we find it extremely useful to\nintroduce an adaptation of Hawking's super-scattering matrix. These explicit\nmodels that we shall construct allow us to quantify and keep clear track of the\nentropy that appears when coarse-graining the system, and the information that\ncan be hidden in unobserved correlations. (While not the focus of the current\narticle, in the longer run these considerations are of interest when addressing\nblack hole information puzzle.)\n", "  Weak antilocalization (WAL) effects in Bi2Te3 single crystals have been\ninvestigated at high and low bulk charge carrier concentrations. At low charge\ncarrier density the WAL curves scale with the normal component of the magnetic\nfield, demonstrating the dominance of topological surface states in\nmagnetoconductivity. At high charge carrier density the WAL curves scale with\nneither the applied field nor its normal component, implying a mixture of bulk\nand surface conduction. WAL due to topological surface states shows no\ndependence on the nature (electrons or holes) of the bulk charge carriers. The\nobservations of an extremely large, non-saturating magnetoresistance, and\nultrahigh mobility in the samples with lower carrier density further support\nthe presence of surface states. The physical parameters characterizing the WAL\neffects are calculated using the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka formula. At high charge\ncarrier concentrations, there is a greater number of conduction channels and a\ndecrease in the phase coherence length compared to low charge carrier\nconcentrations. The extremely large magnetoresistance and high mobility of\ntopological insulators have great technological value and can be exploited in\nmagneto-electric sensors and memory devices.\n", "  We review the effect of the commonly-used Limber and flat-sky approximations\non the calculation of shear power spectra and correlation functions for galaxy\nweak lensing. These approximations are accurate at small scales, but it has\nbeen claimed recently that their impact on low multipoles could lead to an\nincrease in the amplitude of the mass fluctuations inferred from surveys such\nas CFHTLenS, reducing the tension between galaxy weak lensing and the amplitude\ndetermined by Planck from observations of the cosmic microwave background.\nHere, we explore the impact of these approximations on cosmological parameters\nderived from weak lensing surveys, using the CFHTLenS data as a test case. We\nconclude that the use of small-angle approximations for cosmological parameter\nestimation is negligible for current data, and does not contribute to the\ntension between current weak lensing surveys and Planck.\n", "  Sulphur-bearing species are often used to probe the physical structure of\nstar forming regions of the interstellar medium, but the chemistry of sulphur\nin these regions is still poorly understood. In dark clouds, sulphur is\nsupposed to be depleted under a form which is still unknown despite numerous\nobservations and chemical modeling studies that have been performed. In order\nto improve the modeling of sulphur chemistry, we propose an enhancement of the\nsulphur chemical network using experimental and theoretical literature. We test\nthe effect of the updated network on the outputs of a three phases gas-grain\nchemical model for dark cloud conditions using different elemental sulphur\nabundances. More particularly, we focus our study on the main sulphur\nreservoirs as well as on the agreement between model predictions and the\nabundances observed in the dark cloud TMC-1 (CP). Our results show that\ndepending on the age of the observed cloud, the reservoir of sulphur could\neither be atomic sulphur in the gas-phase or HS and H2S in icy grain bulks. We\nalso report the first chemical model able to reproduce the abundances of\nobserved S-bearing species in TMC-1 (CP) using as elemental abundance of\nsulphur its cosmic value.\n", "  The helical edge states in a quantum spin Hall insulator are presumably\nprotected by time- reversal symmetry. However, even in the presence of magnetic\nfield which breaks time-reversal symmetry, the helical edge conduction can\nstill exist, dubbed as pseudo quantum spin Hall effect. In this work, the\neffects of the magnetic fields on the pseudo quantum spin Hall effect and the\nphase transitions are studied. We show that an in-plane magnetic field drives a\npseudo quantum spin Hall state to metallic state at a high field. Moreover, at\na fixed in-plane magnetic field, an increasing out-of-plane magnetic field\nleads to a reentrance of pseudo quantum spin Hall state in an inverted\nInAs/GaSb quantum well. The edge state probability distribution and Chern\nnumbers are calculated to verify that the reentrant states are topologically\nnontrivial. The origin of the reentrant behavior is attributed to the\nnonmonotonic bending of Landau levels and the Landau level mixing caused by the\norbital effect induced by the in-plane magnetic field. The robustness to\ndisorder is demonstrated by the numerically calculated quantized conductance\nfor disordered nanowires within Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism.\n", "  Grand Unified Theories (GUT) offer an elegant and unified description of\nelectromagnetic, weak and strong interactions at high energy scales. A\nphenomenological and exciting possibility to grasp GUT is to search for TeV\nscale observables arising from Abelian groups embedded in GUT constructions.\nThat said, we use dilepton data (ee and $\\mu\\mu$) that has been proven to be a\ngolden channel for a wide variety of new phenomena expected in theories beyond\nthe Standard Model to probe GUT-inspired models. Since heavy dilepton\nresonances feature high signal selection efficiencies and relatively\nwell-understood backgrounds, stringent and reliable bounds can be placed on the\nmass of the $Z^{\\prime}$ gauge boson arising in such theories. In this work, we\nobtain 95\\% C.L. limits on the $Z^{\\prime}$ mass for several GUT-models using\ncurrent and future proton-proton colliders with $\\sqrt{s}= 13~{\\rm TeV},\\,\n33~{\\rm TeV},\\,{\\rm and}\\, 100$~TeV, and put them into perspective with dark\nmatter searches in light of the next generation of direct detection\nexperiments.\n", "  In semiconductor quantum dots the coupling to the environment, i.e. to\nphonons, plays a crucial role for optical state preparation. We analyze the\nphonon impact on two methods for a direct optical preparation of the dark\nexciton, which is enabled by a tilted magnetic field: the excitation with a\nchirped laser pulse and the excitation with a detuned pulse. Our study reveals\nthat for both methods phonons either do not impede the proposed mechanism or\nare even useful by widening the parameter range where a dark state preparation\nis possible due to phonon-assisted dark exciton preparation. In view of the\npositive impact of phonons on the optical preparation the use of dark excitons\nin quantum dots becomes even more attractive.\n", "  We report experimental evidence that multi-MeV protons accelerated in\nrelativistic laser-plasma interactions are modulated by strong filamentary\nelectromagnetic fields. Modulations are observed when a preplasma is developed\non the rear side of a $\\mu$m-scale solid-density hydrogen target. Under such\nconditions, electromagnetic fields are amplified by the relativistic electron\nWeibel instability and are maximized at the critical density region of the\ntarget. The analysis of the spatial profile of the protons indicates the\ngeneration of $B>$10 MG and $E>$0.1 MV/$\\mu$m fields with a $\\mu$m-scale\nwavelength. These results are in good agreement with three-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations and analytical estimates, which further confirm\nthat this process is dominant for different target materials provided that a\npreplasma is formed on the rear side with scale length $\\gtrsim 0.13 \\lambda_0\n\\sqrt{a_0}$. These findings impose important constraints on the preplasma\nlevels required for high-quality proton acceleration for multi-purpose\napplications.\n", "  We present a general methodology to evaluate matrix elements of the effective\ncore potentials (ECPs) within one-electron basis set of Slater-type orbitals\n(STOs). The scheme is based on translation of individual STO distributions in\nthe framework of Barnett-Coulson method. We discuss different types of\nintegrals which naturally appear and reduce them to few basic quantities which\ncan be calculated recursively or purely numerically. Additionally, we consider\nevaluation of the STOs matrix elements involving the core polarisation\npotentials (CPP) and effective spin-orbit potentials. Construction of the STOs\nbasis sets designed specifically for use with ECPs is discussed and differences\nin comparison with all-electron basis sets are briefly summarised. We verify\nthe validity of the present approach by calculating excitation energies, static\ndipole polarisabilities and valence orbital energies for the alkaline earth\nmetals (Ca, Sr, Ba). Finally, we evaluate interaction energies, permanent\ndipole moments and ionisation energies for barium and strontium hydrides, and\ncompare them with the best available experimental and theoretical data.\n", "  Heat is a complex quantity to measure in stochastic systems because it\nrequires extremely small sampling timesteps. Unfortunately this is not always\npossible in real experiments, mainly because experimental setups have technical\nlimits. To overcome this difficulty a Simpson-like quadrature scheme was\nsuggested in [\\emph{Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 2017 375}] as a tool to compute the\nheat in stochastic systems. In this paper we study this new quadrature scheme.\nIn particular, we first give a qualitative proof of the Simpson-like quadrature\nwith the help of Riemann-Stieltjes integrals and we then perform supplementary\nnumerical simulations to confirm our observations. Our main finding is that the\nSimpson-like quadrature yields errors that are much smaller than the ones\nobtained with the Stratonovich quadrature. This opens the possibility to design\nextremely sensitive experiments on stochastic systems without state-of-the-art\nsampling techniques.\n", "  In this study, direct-current reactive sputtered ZnO and ZnO1-x based thin\nfilm (30 nm and 300 nm in thickness) memristor devices were produced and the\neffects of oxygen vacancies and thickness on the memristive characteristics\nwere investigated. The oxygen deficiency of the ZnO1-x structure was confirmed\nby SIMS analyses. The memristive characteristics of both the ZnO and ZnO1-x\ndevices were determined by time dependent current-voltage (I-V-t) measurements.\nThe distinctive pinched hysteresis I-V loops of memristors were observed in all\nthe fabricated devices. The typical homogeneous interface and filamentary types\nof memristive behaviors were compared. In addition, conduction mechanisms,\non/off ratios and the compliance current were analyzed. The 30 nm ZnO based\ndevices with native oxygen vacancies showed the best on/off ratio. All of the\ndevices exhibited dominant Schottky emissions and weaker Poole-Frenkel\nconduction mechanisms. Results suggested that the oxygen deficiency was\nresponsible for the Schottky emission mechanism. Moreover, the compliance\ncurrents of the devices were related to the decreasing power consumption as the\noxygen vacancies increased.\n", "  The focus of the present work is the application of the random phase\napproximation (RPA), derived for inhomogeneous fluids [Frydel and Ma, Phys.\nRev. E 93, 062112 (2016)], to penetrable-spheres. As penetrable-spheres\ntransform into hard-spheres with increasing interactions, they provide an\ninteresting case for exploring the RPA, its shortcomings, and limitations, the\nweak- versus the strong-coupling limit. Two scenarios taken up by the present\nstudy are a one-component and a two-component fluid with symmetric\ninteractions. In the latter case, the mean-field contributions cancel out and\nany contributions from particle interactions are accounted for by correlations.\nThe accuracy of the RPA for this case is the result of a somewhat lucky\ncancellation of errors.\n", "  Amorphous insulating oxides play a significant role in the contemporary\nelectronic industry. Understanding the band alignment of heterogeneous\ninterfaces containing amorphous structures helps to better control the carrier\ntransport property at the interface. Classical band offset methods developed\npreviously line-up eigenlevels with respect to an ideal bulk reference or\nvacuum level. However, the local disorder of amorphous structures makes the\nbulk reference ambiguous. Therefore, classical methods cannot be applied. In\nthis study, we introduce a new approach based on the Linear Combination of\nAtomic Orbital (LCAO) projection of wave-function to line-up bands at\nmetal/oxide interfaces. The LCAO projection of wave-function accounts for all\nmetal/oxide interface effects, such as build-in voltage, interface dipole,\nvirtual oxide thinning, barrier deformation, etc. Therefore, it provides\naccurate band alignments. Calculations performed at an Al/amorphous-SiO2\nexhibit a good agreement between existing experiments and simulation data. We\nAlso observed a space charge region at the interface resulting in non-linear\nband bending in the oxide, which virtually decreases its thickness, hence\nlowering the dielectric strength.\n", "  Magnetic fields in the sun's outer atmosphere -- the corona -- control both\nsolar-wind acceleration and the dynamics of solar eruptions. We present the\nfirst clear observational evidence of coronal magnetic nulls in off-limb\nlinearly polarized observations of pseudostreamers, taken by the Coronal\nMultichannel Polarimeter (CoMP) telescope. These nulls represent regions where\nmagnetic reconnection is likely to act as a catalyst for solar activity. CoMP\nlinear-polarization observations also provide an independent, coronal proxy for\nmagnetic expansion into the solar wind, a quantity often used to parameterize\nand predict the solar wind speed at Earth. We introduce a new method for\nexplicitly calculating expansion factors from CoMP coronal linear-polarization\nobservations, which does not require photospheric extrapolations. We conclude\nthat linearly-polarized light is a powerful new diagnostic of critical coronal\nmagnetic topologies and the expanding magnetic flux tubes that channel the\nsolar wind.\n", "  In 2001, Zurek derived the generic minimum scale $a_{Z}$ for the area of\nstructures of Wigner's quantum phase distribution. Here we show by\nconstruction, using superoscillatory functions, that the Wigner distribution\ncan locally show regular spotty structures on scales much below Zurek's scale\n$a_{Z}$. The price to pay for the presence of such structures is their\nexponential smallness. For the case we construct there is no increased\ninterferometric sensitivity from the presence of patches with superoscillatory\nstructure in phase-space.\n", "  This work introduces a new statistical physics lattice model of bacteria\ninteracting with anti-microbial drugs that can reproduce qualitative features\nof resistance emergence and whose model parameters and outputs can be measured\nwith controlled \\textit{in vitro} experiments. The lattice is inhabited by\nagents modeled by Ising perceptrons. The results show the advantage of mixing\ndrugs among the population compared to other treatment protocols.\n", "  The phenomenon of spin transfer torque (STT) has attracted a great deal of\ninterests due to its promising prospects in practical spintronic devices. In\nthis paper, we report a theoretical investigation of STT in a noncollinear\nmagnetic tunnel junction under ac modulation based on the nonequilibrium\nGreen's function formalism, and derive a closed-formulation for predicting the\ntime-averaged STT. Using this formulation, the ac STT of a\ncarbon-nanotube-based magnetic tunnel junction is analyzed. Under ac\nmodulation, the low-bias linear (quadratic) dependence of the in-plane\n(out-of-plane) torque on bias still holds, and the $\\sin\\theta$ dependence on\nthe noncollinear angle is maintained. By photon-assisted tunneling, the\nbias-induced components of the in-plane and out-of-plane torques can be\nenhanced significantly, about 12 and 75 times, respectively. Our analysis\nreveals the condition for achieving optimized STT enhancement and suggests that\nac modulation is a very effective way for electrical manipulation of STT.\n", "  Superthin galaxies are low surface brightness disc galaxies, characterised by\noptical discs with strikingly high values of planar-to-vertical axes ratios\n($>$ 10), the physical origin and evolution of which continue to be a puzzle.\nWe present mass models for three superthin galaxies: IC5249, UGC7321 and\nIC2233. We use high resolution rotation curves and gas surface density\ndistributions obtained from HI 21 cm radio-synthesis observations, in\ncombination with their two-dimensional structural surface brightness\ndecompositions at Spitzer 3.6 $\\mu$m band, all of which were available in the\nliterature. We find that while models with the pseudo-isothermal (PIS) and the\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter density profiles fit the observed\nrotation curves of IC5249 and UGC7321 equally well, those with the NFW profile\ndoes not comply with the slowly-rising rotation curve of IC2233. Interestingly,\nfor all of our sample galaxies, the best-fitting mass models with a PIS dark\nmatter density profile indicate a {\\it compact} dark matter halo i.e.,\n$R_c/R_D$ $<$ 2 where $R_c$ is the core radius of the PIS dark matter halo, and\n$R_D$ is the radial scale-length of the exponential stellar disc. The compact\ndark matter halo may be fundamentally responsible for the superthin nature of\nthe stellar disc, and therefore our results may have important implications for\nthe formation and evolution models of superthin galaxies in the universe.\n", "  To understand the self-sustenance of subcritical turbulence in spectrally\nstable shear flows, we performed direct numerical simulations of homogeneous\nshear turbulence for different aspect ratios of the flow domain and analyzed\nthe dynamical processes in Fourier space. There are no exponentially growing\nmodes in such flows and the turbulence is energetically supported only by the\nlinear growth of perturbation harmonics due to the shear flow non-normality.\nThis non-normality-induced, or nonmodal growth is anisotropic in spectral\nspace, which, in turn, leads to anisotropy of nonlinear processes in this\nspace. As a result, a transverse (angular) redistribution of harmonics in\nFourier space appears to be the main nonlinear process in these flows, rather\nthan direct or inverse cascades. We refer to this type of nonlinear\nredistribution as the nonlinear transverse cascade. It is demonstrated that the\nturbulence is sustained by a subtle interplay between the linear nonmodal\ngrowth and the nonlinear transverse cascade that exemplifies a well-known\nbypass scenario of subcritical turbulence. These two basic processes mainly\noperate at large length scales, comparable to the domain size. Therefore, this\ncentral, small wave number area of Fourier space is crucial in the\nself-sustenance; we defined its size and labeled it as the vital area of\nturbulence. Outside the vital area, the nonmodal growth and the transverse\ncascade are of secondary importance. Although the cascades and the\nself-sustaining process of turbulence are qualitatively the same at different\naspect ratios, the number of harmonics actively participating in this process\nvaries, but always remains quite large. This implies that the self-sustenance\nof subcritical turbulence cannot be described by low-order models.\n", "  Context. The Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis\n(ROSINA) was designed to measure the composition of the gas in the coma of\ncomet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the target of the European Space Agency's\nRosetta mission. In addition to the volatiles, ROSINA measured refractories\nsputtered off the comet by the interaction of solar wind protons with the\nsurface of the comet.\n  Aims. The origin of different solar system materials is still heavily\ndebated. Isotopic ratios can be used to distinguish between different\nreservoirs and investigate processes occurring during the formation of the\nsolar system.\n  Methods. ROSINA consisted of two mass spectrometers and a pressure sensor. In\nthe ROSINA Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS), the neutral gas of\ncometary origin was ionized and then deflected in an electric and a magnetic\nfield that separated the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. The DFMS had\na high mass resolution, dynamic range, and sensitivity that allowed detection\nof rare species and the known major volatiles.\n  Results. We measured the relative abundance of all three stable silicon\nisotopes with the ROSINA instrument on board the Rosetta spacecraft.\nFurthermore, we measured $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C in C$_2$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_5$, and CO.\nThe DFMS in situ measurements indicate that the average silicon isotopic\ncomposition shows depletion in the heavy isotopes $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si with\nrespect to $^{28}$Si and solar abundances, while $^{13}$C to $^{12}$C is\nanalytically indistinguishable from bulk planetary and meteorite compositions.\nAlthough the origin of the deficiency of the heavy silicon isotopes cannot be\nexplained unambiguously, we discuss mechanisms that could have contributed to\nthe measured depletion of the isotopes $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si.\n", "  DV UMa is an eclipsing dwarf nova with an orbital period of $\\sim2.06$ h,\nwhich lies just at the bottom edge of the period gap. To detect its orbital\nperiod changes we present 12 new mid-eclipse times by using our CCD photometric\ndata and archival data. Combining with the published mid-eclipse times in\nquiescence, spanning $\\sim30$ yr, the latest version of the $O-C$ diagram was\nobtained and analyzed. The best fit to those available eclipse timings shows\nthat the orbital period of DV UMa is undergoing a cyclic oscillation with a\nperiod of $17.58(\\pm0.52)$ yr and an amplitude of $71.1(\\pm6.7)$ s. The\nperiodic variation most likely arises from the light-travel-time effect via the\npresence of a circumbinary object because the required energy to drive the\nApplegate mechanism is too high in this system. The mass of the unseen\ncompanion was derived as $M_{3}\\sin{i'}=0.025(\\pm0.004)M_{\\odot}$. If the third\nbody is in the orbital plane (i.e. $i'=i=82.9^{\\circ}$) of the eclipsing pair,\nit would match to a brown dwarf. This hypothetical brown dwarf is orbiting its\nhost star at a separation of $\\sim8.6$ AU in an eccentric orbit ($e=0.44$).\n", "  We present the photometric results of the eclipsing cataclysmic variable (CV)\nWZ Sge near the period minimum ($P_{min}$). Eight new mid-eclipse times were\ndetermined and the orbital ephemeris was updated. Our result shows that the\norbital period of WZ Sge is decreasing at a rate of\n$\\dot{P}=-2.72(\\pm0.23)\\times{10^{-13}}\\,s s^{-1}$. This secular decrease,\ncoupled with previous detection of its donor, suggest that WZ Sge is a\npre-bounce system. Further analysis indicates that the observed period decrease\nrate is about $1.53$ times higher than pure gravitational radiation (GR)\ndriving. We constructed the evolutionary track of WZ Sge, which predicts that\n$P_{min}$ of WZ Sge is $\\sim77.98 (\\pm0.90)$ min. If the orbital period\ndecreases at the current rate, WZ Sge will evolve past its $P_{min}$ after\n$\\sim25.3$ Myr. Based on the period evolution equation we find\n$\\dot{M}_{2}\\simeq4.04(\\pm0.10)\\times10^{-11}M_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$, which is\ncompatible with the current concept of CV evolution at ultrashort orbital\nperiods.\n", "  Unidirectional control of optically induced spin waves in a rare-earth iron\ngarnet crystal is demonstrated. We observed the interference of two spin-wave\npackets with different initial phases generated by circularly polarized light\npulses. This interference results in unidirectional propagation if the\nspin-wave sources are spaced apart at 1/4 of the wavelength of the spin waves\nand the initial phase difference is set to pi/2. The propagating direction of\nthe spin wave is switched by the polarization helicity of the light pulses.\nMoreover, in a numerical simulation, applying more than two spin-wave sources\nwith a suitable polarization and spot shape, arbitrary manipulation of the spin\nwave by the phased array method was replicated.\n", "  In this paper, we have proposed a modified Marker-And-Cell (MAC) method to\ninvestigate the problem of an unsteady 2-D incompressible flow with heat and\nmass transfer at low, moderate, and high Reynolds numbers with no-slip and slip\nboundary conditions. We have used this method to solve the governing equations\nalong with the boundary conditions and thereby to compute the flow variables,\nviz. $u$-velocity, $v$-velocity, $P$, $T$, and $C$. We have used the staggered\ngrid approach of this method to discretize the governing equations of the\nproblem. A modified MAC algorithm was proposed and used to compute the\nnumerical solutions of the flow variables for Reynolds numbers $Re = 10$, 500,\nand 50,000 in consonance with low, moderate, and high Reynolds numbers. We have\nalso used appropriate Prandtl $(Pr)$ and Schmidt $(Sc)$ numbers in consistence\nwith relevancy of the physical problem considered. We have executed this\nmodified MAC algorithm with the aid of a computer program developed and run in\nC compiler. We have also computed numerical solutions of local Nusselt $(Nu)$\nand Sherwood $(Sh)$ numbers along the horizontal line through the geometric\ncenter at low, moderate, and high Reynolds numbers for fixed $Pr = 6.62$ and\n$Sc = 340$ for two grid systems at time $t = 0.0001s$. Our numerical solutions\nfor u and v velocities along the vertical and horizontal line through the\ngeometric center of the square cavity for $Re = 100$ has been compared with\nbenchmark solutions available in the literature and it has been found that they\nare in good agreement. The present numerical results indicate that, as we move\nalong the horizontal line through the geometric center of the domain, we\nobserved that, the heat and mass transfer decreases up to the geometric center.\nIt, then, increases symmetrically.\n", "  Ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are expected to be accelerated in\nastrophysical sources and to travel through extragalactic space before hitting\nthe Earth atmosphere. They interact both with the environment in the source and\nwith the intergalactic photon fields they encounter, causing different\nprocesses at various scales depending on the photon energy in the nucleus rest\nframe. UHECR interactions are sensitive to uncertainties in the extragalactic\nbackground spectrum and in the photo-disintegration models.\n", "  World record setting has long attracted public interest and scientific\ninvestigation. Extremal records summarize the limits of the space explored by a\nprocess, and the historical progression of a record sheds light on the\nunderlying dynamics of the process. Existing analyses of prediction,\nstatistical properties, and ultimate limits of record progressions have focused\non particular domains. However, a broad perspective on how record progressions\nvary across different spheres of activity needs further development. Here we\nemploy cross-cutting metrics to compare records across a variety of domains,\nincluding sports, games, biological evolution, and technological development.\nWe find that these domains exhibit characteristic statistical signatures in\nterms of rates of improvement, \"burstiness\" of record-breaking time series, and\nthe acceleration of the record breaking process. Specifically, sports and games\nexhibit the slowest rate of improvement and a wide range of rates of\n\"burstiness.\" Technology improves at a much faster rate and, unlike other\ndomains, tends to show acceleration in records. Many biological and\ntechnological processes are characterized by constant rates of improvement,\nshowing less burstiness than sports and games. It is important to understand\nhow these statistical properties of record progression emerge from the\nunderlying dynamics. Towards this end, we conduct a detailed analysis of a\nparticular record-setting event: elite marathon running. In this domain, we\nfind that studying record-setting data alone can obscure many of the structural\nproperties of the underlying process. The marathon study also illustrates how\nsome of the standard statistical assumptions underlying record progression\nmodels may be inappropriate or commonly violated in real-world datasets.\n", "  In this work we will summarise the recent progress made in constructing\nconsistent theories for a massive vector field with derivative\nself-interactions. The construction is such that only the three desired\npolarisations of the Proca field propagate. We apply a systematic construction\nof the interactions by using the anti-symmetric Levi-Civita tensors. This\nfinite family of allowed derivative self-interactions can be also obtained from\nthe decoupling limit by imposing that the St\\\"uckelberg field only contains\nsecond derivatives both with itself and with the transverse modes. These\ninteractions can be generalised to curved backgrounds, which relies on the\npresence of non-minimal couplings and constitutes a general family of\nvector-tensor interactions. We discuss also some extensions of these\ninteractions by alleviating the restriction of second order nature of the\nequations or by imposing global symmetries. We will also comment on their\ninteresting cosmological applications.\n", "  We provide a framework for generic 4D conformal bootstrap computations. It is\nbased on the unification of two independent approaches, the covariant\n(embedding) formalism and the non-covariant (conformal frame) formalism. We\nconstruct their main ingredients (tensor structures and differential operators)\nand establish a precise connection between them. We supplement the discussion\nby additional details like classification of tensor structures of n-point\nfunctions, normalization of 2-point functions and seed conformal blocks,\nCasimir differential operators and treatment of conserved operators and\npermutation symmetries. Finally, we implement our framework in a Mathematica\npackage and make it freely available.\n", "  This paper uses radial colour profiles to infer the distributions of dust,\ngas and star formation in z=0.4-1.4 star-forming main sequence galaxies. We\nstart with the standard UVJ-based method to estimate dust extinction and\nspecific star formation rate (sSFR). By replacing J with I band, a new\ncalibration method suitable for use with ACS+WFC3 data is created (i.e. UVI\ndiagram). Using a multi-wavelength multi-aperture photometry catalogue based on\nCANDELS, UVI colour profiles of 1328 galaxies are stacked in stellar mass and\nredshift bins. The resulting colour gradients, covering a radial range of\n0.2--2.0 effective radii, increase strongly with galaxy mass and with global\n$A_V$. Colour gradient directions are nearly parallel to the Calzetti\nextinction vector, indicating that dust plays a more important role than\nstellar population variations. With our calibration, the resulting $A_V$\nprofiles fall much more slowly than stellar mass profiles over the measured\nradial range. sSFR gradients are nearly flat without central quenching\nsignatures, except for $M_*>10^{10.5} M_{\\odot}$, where central declines of\n20--25 per cent are observed. Both sets of profiles agree well with previous\nradial sSFR and (continuum) $A_V$ measurements. They are also consistent with\nthe sSFR profiles and, if assuming a radially constant gas-to-dust ratio, gas\nprofiles in recent hydrodynamic models. We finally discuss the striking\nfindings that SFR scales with stellar mass density in the inner parts of\ngalaxies, and that dust content is high in the outer parts despite low\nstellar-mass surface densities there.\n", "  The vertical configuration is a powerful tool recently developed\nexperimentally to investigate field effects in quasi 2D systems. Prototype\ngraphene-based vertical tunneling transistors can achieve an extraordinary\ncontrol over current density utilizing gate voltages. In this work we study\ntheoretically vertical tunneling junctions that consist of a monolayer of\nphoto-switchable aryl-azobenzene molecules of sandwiched between two sheets of\ngraphene. Azobenzene molecules transform between {\\it trans} and {\\it cis}\nconformations upon photoexcitation, thus adding a second knob that enhances\ncontrol over physical properties of the junction. Using first-principles\nmethods within the density functional framework, we perform simulations with\nthe inclusion of field effects for both {\\it trans} and {\\it cis}\nconfigurations. We find that the interference of interface states resulting\nfrom molecule-graphene interactions at the Fermi energy introduces a dual-peak\npattern in the transmission functions and dominates the transport properties of\ngate junctions, shedding new light on interfacial processes.\n", "  Doping a semiconductor quantum dot with just a single impurity atom can\ncompletely transform its physical properties. Here, we report and analyze the\nmagnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra of colloidal CdSe quantum dot samples\ncontaining on average fewer than one Mn2+ per quantum dot. Even at this\nsub-single-dopant level, the low-temperature low-field data are dominated by\nimpurity-induced Zeeman splittings caused by dopant-carrier sp-d exchange.\nUnlike in more heavily doped quantum dots, however, the MCD intensity at the\nfirst CdSe exciton shows a field-induced sign flip as the field strength is\nincreased, reflecting competition between sp-d exchange and the intrinsic\nZeeman splittings of comparable magnitude. Most unusually, the competition\nbetween these two effects leads to a large apparent shift in the first MCD peak\nmaximum, which we show is attributable to a difference in sign of the intrinsic\nexcitonic g factor between the first and second excitons. Finally, the sp-d and\nintrinsic contributions to the excitonic Zeeman splittings each exhibit unique\nmagnetic-field and temperature dependencies, allowing the MCD spectra of\nundoped, singly doped, and bi-doped quantum dot sub-ensembles to be analyzed.\n", "  Spectral dispersion of ultrashort pulses allows simultaneous focusing of\nlight in both space and time creating so-called spatio-temporal foci. Such\nspace-time coupling may be combined with existing holographic techniques to\ngive a further dimension of control when generating focal light fields. It is\nshown that a phase-only hologram placed in the pupil plane of an objective and\nilluminated by a spatially chirped ultrashort pulse can be used to generate\nthree dimensional arrays of spatio-temporally focused spots. Exploiting the\npulse front tilt generated at focus when applying simultaneous spatial and\ntemporal focusing (SSTF), it is possible to overlap neighbouring foci in time\nto create a smooth intensity distribution. The resulting light field displays a\nhigh level of axial confinement, with experimental demonstrations given through\ntwo-photon microscopy and non-linear laser fabrication of glass.\n", "  The LHCb experiment has the unique possibility, among the LHC experiments, to\nbe operated in fixed target mode, using its internal gas target. The energy\nscale achievable at the LHC, combined with the LHCb forward geometry and\ndetector capabilities, allow to explore particle production in a wide\nBjorken-$x$ range at the $\\sqrt{s_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\rm NN}} \\sim 100$ GeV\nenergy scale, providing novel inputs to nuclear and cosmic ray physics. The\nfirst measurement of antiproton production in collisions of LHC protons on\nhelium nuclei at rest is presented. The knowledge of this cross-section is of\ngreat importance for the study of the cosmic antiproton flux, and the LHCb\nresults are expected to improve the interpretation of the recent high-precision\nmeasurements of cosmic antiprotons performed by the space-borne PAMELA and\nAMS-02 experiments.\n", "  We present a study of social networks based on the analysis of Brazilian and\nPortuguese family names (surnames). We construct networks whose nodes are names\nof families and whose edges represent parental relations between two families.\nFrom these networks we extract the connectivity distribution, clustering\ncoefficient, shortest path and centrality. We find that the connectivity\ndistribution follows an approximate power law. We associate the number of hubs,\ncentrality and entropy to the degree of miscegenation in the societies in both\ncountries. Our results show that Portuguese society has a higher miscegenation\ndegree than Brazilian society. All networks analyzed lead to approximate\ninverse square power laws in the degree distribution. We conclude that the\nthermodynamic limit is reached for small networks (3 or 4 thousand nodes). The\nassortative mixing of all networks is negative, showing that the more connected\nvertices are connected to vertices with lower connectivity. Finally, the\nnetwork of surnames presents some small world characteristics.\n", "  When studying tropical cyclones using the $f$-plane, axisymmetric, gradient\nbalanced model, there arises a second-order elliptic equation for the\ntransverse circulation. Similarly, when studying zonally symmetric meridional\ncirculations near the equator (the tropical Hadley cells) or the katabatically\nforced meridional circulation over Antarctica, there also arises a second order\nelliptic equation. These elliptic equations are usually derived in the pressure\ncoordinate or the potential temperature coordinate, since the thermal wind\nequation has simple non-Jacobian forms in these two vertical coordinates.\nBecause of the large variations in surface pressure that can occur in tropical\ncyclones and over the Antarctic ice sheet, there is interest in using other\nvertical coordinates, e.g., the height coordinate, the classical\n$\\sigma$-coordinate, or some type of hybrid coordinate typically used in global\nnumerical weather prediction or climate models. Because the thermal wind\nequation in these coordinates takes a Jacobian form, the derivation of the\nelliptic transverse circulation equation is not as simple. Here we present a\nmethod for deriving the elliptic transverse circulation equation in a\ngeneralized vertical coordinate, which allows for many particular vertical\ncoordinates, such as height, pressure, log-pressure, potential temperature,\nclassical $\\sigma$, and most hybrid cases. Advantages and disadvantages of the\nvarious coordinates are discussed.\n", "  Recent work of Fu, Koeller, and Marolf shows that in $d\\geq 5$ dimensions a\nnonzero Gauss-Bonnet coupling of either sign can lead to a pointwise violation\nof the Quantum Focusing Conjecture. This violation is due to the classical\ngeometric terms appearing in the QFC. Since those geometric terms are properly\nunderstood as expectation values of operators in an effective field theory, we\nargue that they are only well-defined when smeared over a region at least as\nlarge as the cutoff scale of the theory (which may be the Planck scale). We\nfind that this smearing prescription removes the pointwise violation found by\nFu et al.. We comment on the relationship to similar issues encountered in the\nstudy of Entanglement Wedge Nesting in holography.\n", "  This paper presents a model for a dynamical system where particles dominate\nedges in a complex network. The proposed dynamical system is then extended to\nan application on the problem of community detection and data clustering. In\nthe case of the data clustering problem, 6 different techniques were simulated\non 10 different datasets in order to compare with the proposed technique. The\nresults show that the proposed algorithm performs well when prior knowledge of\nthe number of clusters is known to the algorithm.\n", "  In iron-based superconductors, high critical temperature (Tc)\nsuperconductivity over 50 K has only been accomplished in electron-doped\nhREFeAsO (hRE = heavy rare earth (RE) element). While hREFeAsO has the highest\nbulk Tc (58 K), progress in understanding its physical properties has been\nrelatively slow due to difficulties in achieving high concentration\nelectron-doping and carrying out neutron-experiments. Here, we present a\nsystematic neutron powder diffraction (NPD) study of 154SmFeAsO1-xDx, and the\ndiscovery of a new long-range antiferromagnetic ordering with x >= 0.56 (AFM2)\naccompanying a structural transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic.\nSurprisingly, the Fe magnetic moment in AFM2 reaches a magnitude of 2.73\nmuB/Fe, which is the largest in all non-doped iron pnictides and chalcogenides.\nTheoretical calculations suggest that the AFM2 phase originates in kinetic\nfrustration of the Fe-3dxy orbital, in which the nearest neighbor hopping\nparameter becomes zero. The unique phase diagram, i. e., highest-Tc\nsuperconducting phase is adjacent to the strongly correlated phase in\nelectron-overdoped regime, yields important clues to the unconventional origins\nof superconductivity.\n", "  For a quantum confinement model, the wave function of a particle is zero\noutside the confined region. Due to this, the negative energy states are, in\nfact, square integrable. As negative energy states are not physical, we need to\nimpose some boundary conditions in order to avoid these states. For the case of\nthe infinite square well model, we show the possible boundary conditions that\navoid the existence of the negative energy states. The well-known boundary\ncondition requiring the wave function be continuous on both sides of the well\nis one of the boundary conditions that avoids negative energy states. However,\nthere are other types of boundary condition that can also avoid the negative\nenergy states. This shows that there are the different branch of physical\nsystems that can be established on the infinite square well model.\n", "  The causality of dissipative phenomena can not be treated in traditional\ntheories of dissipations, Fourier laws and Navier-Stokes equations. This is the\nreason why the dissipative phenomena have not been studies well in relativistic\nsituations. Furthermore, the interactions among dissipations, e.g. the heating\nof fluid due to viscous flow and the occurrence of viscous flow due to heat\nflux, are not explicitly described in those traditional laws. One of the\nphenomenologies which describe the causality and interaction of dissipations is\nthe Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics (EIT). (Israel-Stewart theory of\ndissipative hydrodynamics is one approximate form of EIT.) This manuscript\nreviews an axiomatic construction of EIT and Israel-Stewart hydrodynamic\ntheory. Also, we point out that the EIT is also applicable to radiative\ntransfer in optically \\emph{thick} matters. However, radiative transfer in\noptically \\emph{thin} matters can not be described by EIT, because the\nnon-self-interacting nature of photons is incompatible with a basic requirement\nof EIT, \"the bilinear form of entropy production rate\". The break down of EIT\nin optically thin situation is not explicitly recognized in standard references\nof EIT and Israel-Stewart theory. Some detail of how EIT fails to describe a\nradiative transfer in optically thin situations is also explained. (This\nmanuscript is a revision of the contribution to a book Ref.[26] published in\n2011. So, recent developments made after 2011 may not be cited.)\n", "  Cyclotron resonance scattering features or cyclotron absorption lines are\nunique features observed in the hard X-ray spectra of accretion powered X-ray\npulsars with magnetic field of the order of 10$^{12}$ G. Detection of these\nfeatures enables us for the direct estimation of strength of the magnetic field\nclose to the neutron star surface. Corresponding to magnetic field of\n$\\sim$10$^{12}$ G, the fundamental cyclotron lines are expected in 10-100 keV\nenergy range with harmonics expected at multiples of fundamental line energy.\nHowever, we detected first harmonic of cyclotron line at less than twice of the\nfundamental line energy ($\\sim$1.7 times the fundamental line energy) in\nBe/X-ray binary pulsar Cep X-4. With the broadband spectral capability of\n$Suzaku$ and $NuSTAR$ observatories, we have investigated cyclotron resonance\nscattering features in several X-ray pulsars to understand the shape of the\nlines, width, magnetic field mapping, anharmonicity in the line energies and\nluminosity-dependent properties of cyclotron lines. The results obtained from\nthese works and new detection of cyclotron line in unknown/poorly studied\nsources are presented in this paper.\n", "  Lightning is common throughout the Solar System, and charging of particles\noccurs in all atmospheres due to ionization from galactic cosmic rays. Here,\nsome electrical processes relevant to the atmosphere of Venus are outlined and\ndiscussed in a comparative planetology context.\n", "  Presented study concerns the possibility of evaluation of interfacial thermal\nresistance (ITR) between the constituents in composite materials with the use\nof flash technique. Two variants of such measurement are considered, the first\nof which is the measurement of ITR between two bonded layers of different\nmaterials which had been studied before by various researchers. The second\ntested measurement method is targeted at determination of ITR in particulate\ncomposites with low and moderate filler content based on their effective\nthermal conductivity. Method of such measurement is proposed and tested on two\ncases of particle-filled polymer composites. Positive verification results were\nobtained for polymer/glass composite in which the difference between thermal\nconductivities of matrix and filler is low. For a polymer filled with aluminum\nparticles the evaluation of average ITR in the samples was impossible as the\neffective medium models applied in the method strongly underestimated the\nthermal conductivity of that material. The investigation confirmed the need for\nmore accurate methods of macroscopic thermal properties prediction for\ncomposite media with high contrast of thermal conductivities of the\nconstituents. Extended literature study suggests that the method can be\napplicable to selected classes of engineering materials.\n", "  The KDamper is a novel passive vibration isolation and damping concept, based\nessentially on the optimal combination of appropriate stiffness elements, which\ninclude a negative stiffness el-ement. Among others, KDamper can provide\ncomparative advantages in the very low fre-quency range. It should be\nmentioned, that the KDamping concept does not simply refer to a discrete\nvibration absorption device, but it consists a general vibration ab-sorption\nconcept, applicable also for the design of advanced materials or complex\nstructures. Such a concept thus presents the potential for numerous\nimplementations in a large variety of technological applications, while further\npotential may emerge in a multi- physics environment. The paper proceeds to a\nreview of the optimal design and selection of the parameters of the KDamper,\nwhich follows exactly the classical approach used for the design of the TMD.\nThe negative stiffness elements have been replaced with a set of Belleville\n(disc) springs. It should be mentioned that two different cases for an initial\ndisplacement and an initial velocity have been considered. It is thus\ntheoretically proven that the KDamper can inherently offer far better isolation\nand damping properties than the TMD. Finally, an application concerning the\nimplementation of the KDamper for the design of a low frequency vertical\nvibration isolator is presented.\n", "  The classical theories of communication rely on the assumption that there has\nto be a flow of particles from Bob to Alice in order for him to send a message\nto her. We develop a quantum protocol that allows Alice to perceive Bob's\nmessage \"counterfactually\". That is, without Alice receiving any particles that\nhave interacted with Bob. By utilising a setup built on results from\ninteraction-free measurements, we outline a communication protocol whereby the\ninformation travels in the opposite direction of the emitted particles. In\ncomparison to previous attempts on such protocols, this one is such that a weak\nmeasurement at the message source would not leave a weak trace that could be\ndetected by Alice's receiver. Whilst some interaction-free schemes require a\nlarge number of carefully aligned beam-splitters, our protocol is realisable\nwith two or more beam-splitters. We demonstrate this protocol by numerically\nsolving the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger Equation (TDSE) for a Hamiltonian that\nimplements this quantum counterfactual phenomenon.\n", "  Quantitative thermal imaging has the potential of reliable temperature\nmeasurement across an entire field-of-view. This non-invasive technique has\napplications in aerospace, manufacturing and process control. However, robust\ntemperature measurement on the sub-millimetre (30 {\\mu}m) length scale has yet\nto be demonstrated. Here, the temperature performance and size-of-source\n(source size) effect of a 3 {\\mu}m to 5 {\\mu}m thermal imaging system have been\nassessed. In addition a technique of quantifying thermal imager non-uniformity\nis described. An uncertainty budget is constructed, which describes a\nmeasurement uncertainty of 640 mK (k = 2) for a target with a size of 10 mm.\nThe results of this study provide a foundation for developing the capability\nfor confident quantitative sub-millimetre thermal imaging.\n", "  Compared with numerous X-ray dominant active galactic nuclei (AGNs) without\nemission-line signatures in their optical spectra, the X-ray selected AGNs with\noptical emission lines are probably still in the high-accretion phase of black\nhole growth. This paper presents an investigation on the fraction of these\nX-ray detected AGNs with optical emission-line spectra in 198 galaxy groups at\n$z<1$ in a rest frame 0.1-2.4 keV luminosity range 41.3 <log(L_X/erg s-1) <\n44.1 within the COSMOS field, as well as its variations with redshift and group\nrichness. For various selection criteria of member galaxies, the numbers of\ngalaxies and the AGNs with optical emission lines in each galaxy group are\nobtained. It is found that, in total 198 X-ray groups, there are 27 AGNs\ndetected in 26 groups. AGN fraction is on everage less than $4.6 (\\pm 1.2)\\%$\nfor individual groups hosting at least one AGN. The corrected overall AGN\nfraction for whole group sample is less than $0.98 (\\pm 0.11) \\%$. The\nnormalized locations of group AGNs show that 15 AGNs are found to be located in\ngroup centers, including all 6 low-luminosity group AGNs. A week rising\ntendency with $z$ are found: overall AGN fraction is 0.30-0.43% for the groups\nat $z<0.5$, and 0.55-0.64% at 0.5 < z < 1.0. For the X-ray groups at $z>0.5$,\nmost member AGNs are X-ray bright, optically dull, which results in a lower AGN\nfractions at higher redshifts. The AGN fraction in isolated fields also\nexhibits a rising trend with redshift, and the slope is consistent with that in\ngroups. The environment of galaxy groups seems to make no difference in\ndetection probability of the AGNs with emission lines. Additionally, a larger\nAGN fractions are found in poorer groups, which implies that the AGNs in poorer\ngroups might still be in the high-accretion phase, whereas the AGN population\nin rich clusters is mostly in the low-accretion, X-ray dominant phase.\n", "  The charge transfer integral, site energy and the stacking angle fluctuations\nare used to study the hole and electron transport in recently synthesized\ndialkyl substituted thienothiophene caped benzobisthiazole (BDHTT-BBT) and\nmethyl-substituted dicyanovinyl-capped quinquethiophene (DCV5T-Me) molecules.\nThe charge transfer parameters, such as coherent and incoherent rate\ncoefficients, hopping conductivity, mobility, disorder drift time, drift force,\npotential equilibrium rate and density flux rate are calculated and discussed.\nIt has been observed that the charge decay up to the crossover point (or\ndisorder drift time) is exponential, non-dispersive and charge transport\nfollows the band-like transport. Beyond the disorder drift time, the charge\ndecay is not fully exponential, dispersive and it follows the incoherent\nhopping transport. The proposed expressions for density flux and diffusion\nshows their dependency on dynamic disorder and is in agreement with the Troisi\nmodel on diffusion limited by thermal disorder. The density flux rate is\ndirectly related with the drift force which facilitates the charge transfer.\nCalculated electron hopping conductivity in the BDHTT-BBT and DCV5T-Me is 0.8\nand 0.18 S/cm, respectively. Molecule BDHTT-BBT has good electron mobility of\n0.36 cm^2/V s, which has larger electron density flux rate and drift force of\n1.7 x10^20 C/m^3 s and 1.44x10^-12 N.\n", "  The interpretation of electroweak precision data in the Standard Model\nEffective Field Theory is discussed. One loop corrections $\\propto y_t^2,\n\\lambda$ to the partial $Z$ decay widths and ratios of partial widths in this\ntheory are discussed. A reparameterization invariance and the non-minimal\ncharacter of matching onto this theory is reviewed.\n", "  The interplay of magnetic field and thermal vorticity in a relativistic ideal\nfluid might generate fluid vorticity during the fluid evolution provided the\nflow fields and the entropy density of the fluid is inhomogeneous\n\\cite{Mahajan:2010}. Exploiting this fact and assuming large magnetic Reynolds\nnumber we study the evolution of generalised magnetic field ($\\hat{B}$) which\nis defined as a combination of the usual magnetic field ($\\vec{B}$) and\nrelativistic thermal vorticity ($\\omega^{\\mu\\nu}$), in a 2(space)+1(time)\ndimensional isentropic evolution of Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) with longitudinal\nboost invariance. The temporal evolution of $\\hat{B}$ is found to be different\nthan $\\vec{B}$ , and the $\\hat{B}$ evolution also depends on the position of\nthe fluid along the beam direction (taken along the z axis) with respect to the\nmid-plane $z=0$. Further it is observed that the transverse components\n($\\hat{B_{x}}$, $\\hat{B_{y}}$) evolve differently around the mid-plane.\n", "  The quantum Hall conductance in monolayer graphene on an epitaxial SrTiO3\n(STO) thin film is studied to understand the role of oxygen vacancies in\ndetermining the dielectric properties of STO. As the gate voltage sweep range\nis gradually increased in our device, we observe systematic generation and\nannihilation of oxygen vacancies evidenced from the hysteretic conductance\nbehavior in graphene. Furthermore, based on the experimentally observed linear\nscaling relation between the effective capacitance and the voltage sweep range,\na simple model is constructed to manifest the relationship among the dielectric\nproperties of STO with oxygen vacancies. The inherent quantum Hall conductance\nin graphene can be considered as a sensitive, robust, and non-invasive probe\nfor understanding the electronic and ionic phenomena in complex transition\nmetal oxides without impairing the oxide layer underneath.\n", "  We show that no dark matter model with the conventional isotropic density\ndistribution can provide a satisfactory explanation of the cosmic positron\nexcess, while being consistent with Fermi-LAT data on diffuse gamma-ray\nbackground.\n", "  Layer clouds are abundant in the Earth's atmosphere. Such clouds do not\nbecome sufficiently strongly charged to generate lightning, but they show weak\ncharging along the upper and lower cloud boundaries where there is a\nconductivity transition. Cloud edge charging has recently been observed using\nballoon-carried electrometers. Measurement of cloud boundary charging without\nballoons is shown to be possible here for low altitude (<1km) charged cloud\nbases, through combining their effect on the surface electric field with laser\ntime of flight cloud base height measurements, and the application of simple\nelectrostatic models.\n", "  The crossover from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductivity to\nBose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is difficult to realize in quantum materials\nbecause, unlike in ultracold atoms, one cannot tune the pairing interaction. We\nrealize the BCS-BEC crossover in a nearly compensated semimetal\nFe$_{1+y}$Se$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ by tuning the Fermi energy, $\\epsilon_F$, via\nchemical doping, which permits us to systematically change $\\Delta /\n\\epsilon_F$ from 0.16 to 0.5 were $\\Delta$ is the superconducting (SC) gap. We\nuse angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to measure the Fermi energy, the\nSC gap and characteristic changes in the SC state electronic dispersion as the\nsystem evolves from a BCS to a BEC regime. Our results raise important\nquestions about the crossover in multiband superconductors which go beyond\nthose addressed in the context of cold atoms.\n", "  The Herschel Space Observatory was the fourth cornerstone mission in the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) science programme. It had excellent broad band\nimaging capabilities in the far-infrared (FIR) and sub-millimetre part of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. Although the spacecraft finished observing in 2013,\nit left a large legacy dataset that is far from having been fully explored and\nstill has a great potential for new scientific discoveries. The PACS and SPIRE\nphotometric cameras observed about 8% of the sky in six different wavebands.\nThis document describes the Herschel/PACS Point Source Catalogue (HPPSC), a FIR\ncatalogue based on the broad-band photometric observations of the PACS\ninstrument with filters centred at 70, 100 and 160 microns.\n  We analysed 14842 combined, Level 2.5/Level 3 Herschel/PACS photometric\nobservations. The PACS photometer maps were generated by the JScanam task of\nthe Herschel Interactive Processing Environment (HIPE) v13.0.0. Sources were\nidentified with the HIPE implementation of SUSSEXtractor, and the flux\ndensities obtained by aperture photometry. We found a total of 108 319 point\nsources that are considered to be reliable in the 70 micron maps, 131 322 at\n100 micron and 251 392 point sources in the 160 micron maps. In addition, our\nquality control algorithm identified 546 587 candidate sources that were found\nto be extended and 7 185 160 features which did not pass the signal-to-noise\nand other criteria to be considered reliable sources. These sources were\nincluded in the Extended Source List and Rejected Source List of the HPPSC,\nrespectively. The calculated completeness and photometric accuracy values are\nbased on simulations, where artificial sources were injected into the\nobservational timeline with well controlled flux density values. The actual\ncompleteness is a complex function of the source flux, photometric band and the\nbackground complexity.\n", "  We characterize the response of the quiet time (no substorms or storms)\nlarge-scale ionospheric transient equivalent currents to north-south and\nsouth-north IMF turnings by using a dynamical network of ground-based\nmagnetometers. Canonical correlation between all pairs of SuperMAG magnetometer\nstations in the Northern Hemisphere (magnetic latitude (MLAT) 50-82$^{\\circ}$)\nis used to establish the extent of near-simultaneous magnetic response between\nregions of magnetic local time-MLAT. Parameters and maps that describe\nspatial-temporal correlation are used to characterize the system and its\nresponse to the turnings aggregated over several hundred events. We find that\nregions that experience large increases in correlation post turning coincide\nwith typical locations of a two-cell convection system and are influenced by\nthe interplanetary magnetic field $\\mathit{B}_{y}$. The time between the\nturnings reaching the magnetopause and a network response is found to be\n$\\sim$8-10 min and correlation in the dayside occurs 2-8 min before that in the\nnightside.\n", "  We measured the magnetic correlations in the triangular lattice spin-liquid\ncandidate material YbMgGaO$_4$ via polarized neutron diffraction. The extracted\nin-plane and out-of-plane components of the magnetic structure factor show\nclear anisotropy. We found that short-range correlations persist at the lowest\nmeasured temperature of 52 mK and neutron scattering intensity is centered at\nthe $M$ middle-point of the hexagonal Brillouin-zone edge. Moreover, we found\npronounced spin anisotropy, with different correlation lengths for the in-plane\nand out-of-plane spin components. When comparing to a self-consistent Gaussian\nappoximation, our data clearly support a model with only first-neighbor\ncoupling and strongly anisotropic exchanges.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the Hawking radiation process as a\nsemiclassical quantum tunneling phenomenon from black ring and Myers-Perry\nblack holes in 5-dimensional (5D) spaces. Using Lagrangian of\nGlashow-Weinberg-Salam model with background electromagnetic field (for charged\nW-bosons) and the WKB approximation, we will evaluate the tunneling\nrate/probability of charged vector particles through horizons by taking into\naccount the electromagnetic vector potential. Moreover, we investigate the\ncorresponding Hawking temperature values by considering Boltzmann factor for\nboth cases and analyze the whole spectrum generally.\n", "  Using simulations with a whole-atmosphere chemistry-climate model nudged by\nmeteorological analyses, global satellite observations of nitrogen oxide (NO)\nand water vapour by the Sub-Millimetre Radiometer instrument (SMR), of\ntemperature by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), as well as local radar\nobservations, this study examines the recent major stratospheric sudden warming\naccompanied by an elevated stratopause event (ESE) that occurred in January\n2013. We examine dynamical processes during the ESE, including the role of\nplanetary wave, gravity wave and tidal forcing on the initiation of the descent\nin the mesosphere-lower thermosphere (MLT) and its continuation throughout the\nmesosphere and stratosphere, as well as the impact of model eddy diffusion. We\nanalyse the transport of NO and find the model underestimates the large descent\nof NO compared to SMR observations. We demonstrate that the discrepancy arises\nabruptly in the MLT region at a time when the resolved wave forcing and the\nplanetary wave activity increase, just before the elevated stratopause reforms.\nThe discrepancy persists despite doubling the model eddy diffusion. While the\nsimulations reproduce an enhancement of the semi-diurnal tide following the\nonset of the 2013 SSW, corroborating new meteor radar observations at high\nnorthern latitudes over Trondheim (63.4$^{\\circ}$N), the modelled tidal\ncontribution to the forcing of the mean meridional circulation and to the\ndescent is a small portion of the resolved wave forcing, and lags it by about\nten days.\n", "  Despite the large amount of high quality data generated in recent space\nencounters with asteroids, the majority of our knowledge about these objects\ncomes from ground based observations. Asteroids travelling in orbits that are\npotentially hazardous for the Earth form an especially interesting group to be\nstudied. In order to predict their orbital evolution, it is necessary to\ninvestigate their physical properties. This paper briefly describes the data\nrequirements and different techniques used to solve the lightcurve inversion\nproblem. Although photometry is the most abundant type of observational data,\nmodels of asteroids can be obtained using various data types and techniques. We\ndescribe the potential of radar imaging and stellar occultation timings to be\ncombined with disk-integrated photometry in order to reveal information about\nphysical properties of asteroids.\n", "  In this paper we propose an implicit force control scheme for a one-link\nflexible manipulator that interact with a compliant environment. The controller\nwas based in the mathematical model of the manipulator, considering the\ndynamics of the beam flexible and the gravitational force. With this method,\nthe controller parameters are obtained from the structural parameters of the\nbeam (link) of the manipulator. This controller ensure the stability based in\nthe Lyapunov Theory. The controller proposed has two closed loops: the inner\nloop is a tracking control with gravitational force and vibration frequencies\ncompensation and the outer loop is a implicit force control. To evaluate the\nperformance of the controller, we have considered to three different\nmanipulators (the length, the diameter were modified) and three environments\nwith compliance modified. The results obtained from simulations verify the\nasymptotic tracking and regulated in position and force respectively and the\nvibrations suppression of the beam in a finite time.\n", "  These notes offer a lightening introduction to topological quantum field\ntheory in its functorial axiomatisation, assuming no or little prior exposure.\nWe lay some emphasis on the connection between the path integral motivation and\nthe definition in terms symmetric monoidal categories, and we highlight the\nalgebraic formulation emerging from a formal generators-and-relations\ndescription. This allows one to understand (oriented, closed) 1- and\n2-dimensional TQFTs in terms of a finite amount of algebraic data, while\nalready the 3-dimensional case needs an infinite amount of data. We evade these\ncomplications by instead discussing some aspects of 3-dimensional extended\nTQFTs, and their relation to braided monoidal categories.\n", "  Multi-color photometric light curves of NO Cam in $V$ $R_C$ and $I_C$ bands\nare obtained and analyzed simultaneously using the Wilson-Devinney (W-D)\nprogram. The solutions suggest that NO Cam is an A-subtype overcontact binary\nwith its mass ratio to be $q = 0.439$ and a contact degree of $f = 55.5\\,\\%$.\nThe small temperature difference ($\\Delta T = 44K$) between its two components\nindicates that the system is under thermal contact. The high orbital\ninclination ($i = 84.5^{\\circ}$) strengthens our confidence in the parameters\ndetermined from the light curves. All available times of minimum light are\ncollected and period variations are analyzed for the first time. The $O - C$\ncurve reveals that its period is increasing continuously at a rate of\n$dP/dt=+1.46\\times{10^{-9}}$, which can be explained by mass transfer from the\nless massive component to the more massive one. After the upward parabolic\nvariation is subtracted, the residuals suggest that there may be a cyclic\nvariation with a period of 2.23 years and an amplitude of $A_3 = 0.00153$ days,\nwhich may due to the light-travel time effect (LTTE) arising from the\ngravitational influence of a close-in tertiary component. The close-in\ncompanion reveals that early dynamic interaction among triple system may have\nplayed very important role in the formation of the W UMa type binaries.\n", "  We study the asymptotic behaviour of the nodal length of random\n$2d$-spherical harmonics $f_{\\ell}$ of high degree $\\ell \\rightarrow\\infty$,\ni.e. the length of their zero set $f_{\\ell}^{-1}(0)$. It is found that the\nnodal lengths are asymptotically equivalent, in the $L^{2}$-sense, to the\n\"sample trispectrum\", i.e., the integral of $H_{4}(f_{\\ell}(x))$, the\nfourth-order Hermite polynomial of the values of $f_{\\ell}$. A particular\nby-product of this is a Quantitative Central Limit Theorem (in Wasserstein\ndistance) for the nodal length, in the high energy limit.\n", "  Despite the importance of high thermal conductance (i.e. low thermal\nresistance) of metal contacts to thermal management of graphene devices, prior\nreported thermal conductance of metal/graphene interfaces are all relatively\nlow, only 20-40 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$. One possible route to improve the thermal\nconductance ($G$) of metal/graphene interfaces is through additional heat\nconduction by electrons, since graphene can be easily doped by metals. In this\npaper, we evaluate the electronic heat conduction across metal/graphene\ninterfaces by measuring the thermal conductance of Pd/transferred graphene\n(trG)/Pd interfaces, prepared by either thermal evaporation or radio-frequency\n(rf) magnetron sputtering, over a wide temperature range of 80 to 500 K. We\nfind that for the samples prepared by thermal evaporation, the thermal\nconductance of Pd/trG/Pd is 42 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$. The thermal conductance\nonly weakly depends on temperature, which suggests that heat is predominantly\ncarried by phonons across the intrinsic Pd/graphene interface. However, for\nPd/trG/Pd samples with the top Pd films deposited by rf magnetron sputtering,\nwe observe a significant increment of thermal conductance from the intrinsic\nvalue of 42 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ to 300 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, and $G$ is\nroughly proportional to $T$. We attribute the enhancement of thermal\nconductance to an additional channel of heat transport by electrons via\natomic-scale pinholes formed in the graphene during the sputtering process. We\nthus conclude that electrons play a negligible role in heat conduction across\nintrinsic interfaces of metal and pristine graphene, and the contribution of\nelectrons is only substantial if graphene is damaged.\n", "  An environmental cell high resolution electron microscope (EHREM) has been\ndeveloped for in situ studies of dynamic chemical reactions on the atomic\nscale. It allows access to metastable intermediate phases of catalysts and to\nsequences of reversible microstructural and chemical development associated\nwith the activation, deactivation and poisoning of a catalyst. Materials\ntransported through air can be restored or recreated and samples damaged, e.g.\nby dehydration, by the usual vacuum environment in a conventional electron\nmicroscope can be preserved. A Philips C M30 HRTEM and STEM system has been\nextensively modified in our laboratory to add facilities for in situ gas-solid\nreaction studies in controlled atmospheres of gas or vapor at pressures of 0 to\n50 mbar, instead of the regular TEM high vacuum environment. The integrated new\nenvironmental cell capability is combined with the original 0.23 nm TEM\nresolution, STEM imaging (bright field and annular dark field) and chemical and\ncrystallographic microanalyses. Regular sample holders are used and include hot\nstages to higher than 1000 C. Examples of applications include direct studies\nof dynamic reactions with supported metal particle catalysts, the generation of\ndefects and structural changes in practical complex oxide catalyst systems\nunder operating conditions and carbon microstructures.\n", "  Advances in atomic resolution in situ environmental transmission electron\nmicroscopy for direct probing of gas-solid reactions, including at very high\ntemperatures are described. In addition, recent developments of dynamic real\ntime in situ studies at the Angstrom level using a hot stage in an aberration\ncorrected environment are presented. In situ data from Pt and Pd nanoparticles\non carbon with the corresponding FFT (optical diffractogram) illustrate an\nachieved resolution of 0.11 nm at 500 C and higher in a double aberration\ncorrected TEM and STEM instrument employing a wider gap objective pole piece.\nThe new results open up opportunities for dynamic studies of materials in an\naberration corrected environment.\n", "  This paper presents the development of an Adaptive Algebraic Multiscale\nSolver for Compressible flow (C-AMS) in heterogeneous porous media. Similar to\nthe recently developed AMS for incompressible (linear) flows [Wang et al., JCP,\n2014], C-AMS operates by defining primal and dual-coarse blocks on top of the\nfine-scale grid. These coarse grids facilitate the construction of a\nconservative (finite volume) coarse-scale system and the computation of local\nbasis functions, respectively. However, unlike the incompressible (elliptic)\ncase, the choice of equations to solve for basis functions in compressible\nproblems is not trivial. Therefore, several basis function formulations\n(incompressible and compressible, with and without accumulation) are considered\nin order to construct an efficient multiscale prolongation operator. As for the\nrestriction operator, C-AMS allows for both multiscale finite volume (MSFV) and\nfinite element (MSFE) methods. Finally, in order to resolve high-frequency\nerrors, fine-scale (pre- and post-) smoother stages are employed. In order to\nreduce computational expense, the C-AMS operators (prolongation, restriction,\nand smoothers) are updated adaptively. In addition to this, the linear system\nin the Newton-Raphson loop is infrequently updated. Systematic numerical\nexperiments are performed to determine the effect of the various options,\noutlined above, on the C-AMS convergence behaviour. An efficient C-AMS strategy\nfor heterogeneous 3D compressible problems is developed based on overall CPU\ntimes. Finally, C-AMS is compared against an industrial-grade Algebraic\nMultiGrid (AMG) solver. Results of this comparison illustrate that the C-AMS is\nquite efficient as a nonlinear solver, even when iterated to machine accuracy.\n", "  This paper introduces an Algebraic MultiScale method for simulation of flow\nin heterogeneous porous media with embedded discrete Fractures (F-AMS). First,\nmultiscale coarse grids are independently constructed for both porous matrix\nand fracture networks. Then, a map between coarse- and fine-scale is obtained\nby algebraically computing basis functions with local support. In order to\nextend the localization assumption to the fractured media, four types of basis\nfunctions are investigated: (1) Decoupled-AMS, in which the two media are\ncompletely decoupled, (2) Frac-AMS and (3) Rock-AMS, which take into account\nonly one-way transmissibilities, and (4) Coupled-AMS, in which the matrix and\nfracture interpolators are fully coupled. In order to ensure scalability, the\nF-AMS framework permits full flexibility in terms of the resolution of the\nfracture coarse grids. Numerical results are presented for two- and\nthree-dimensional heterogeneous test cases. During these experiments, the\nperformance of F-AMS, paired with ILU(0) as second-stage smoother in a\nconvergent iterative procedure, is studied by monitoring CPU times and\nconvergence rates. Finally, in order to investigate the scalability of the\nmethod, an extensive benchmark study is conducted, where a commercial algebraic\nmultigrid solver is used as reference. The results show that, given an\nappropriate coarsening strategy, F-AMS is insensitive to severe fracture and\nmatrix conductivity contrasts, as well as the length of the fracture networks.\nIts unique feature is that a fine-scale mass conservative flux field can be\nreconstructed after any iteration, providing efficient approximate solutions in\ntime-dependent simulations.\n", "  First-principles density functional theory (DFT) is employed to investigate\nthe interactions of CO2 gas molecules with pristine and lithium-functionalized\ngermanene. It is discovered that although a single CO2 molecule is weakly\nphysisorbed on pristine germanene, a significant improvement on its adsorption\nenergy is found by utilizing Li-functionalized germanene as the adsorbent.\nHowever, the moderate adsorption energy at high CO2 coverage predicts an easy\nrelease step. More excitingly, the structure of Li-functionalized germanene can\nbe fully recovered after removal of CO2 gas molecules. Our results suggest that\nLi-functionalized germanene show promise for CO2 sensing and capture with a\nstorage capacity of 12.57 mol/kg.\n", "  The propagation of sound waves on lipid monolayers supported on water has\nbeen studied during the melting transition. Since changes in volume, area, and\ncompressibility in lipid membranes have biological relevance, the observed\nsound propagation is of paramount importance. However, it is unknown what would\noccur on a lipid bilayer, which is a more approximate model of a cell membrane.\nWith the aim to answer this relevant question, we built an experimental setup\nto assemble long artificial lipid membranes. We found that if these membranes\nare heated in order to force local melting, a thermo-mechanical perturbation\npropagates a long distance. Our findings may support the existence of solitary\nwaves, postulated to explain the propagation of isentropic signals together\nwith the action potential in neurons.\n", "  We have generalised the exact solution of the Riemann problem in special\nrelativistic hydrodynamics for arbitrary tangential flow velocities. The\nsolution is obtained by solving the jump conditions across shocks plus an\nordinary differential equation arising from the self-similarity condition along\nrarefaction waves, in a similar way as in purely normal flow. The dependence of\nthe solution on the tangential velocities is analysed, and the impact of this\nresult on the development of multidimensional relativistic hydrodynamic codes\n(of Godunov type) is discussed.\n", "  Recent work on single bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) has shown that many\nfeatures of this phenomenon, especially the dependence of SBSL intensity and\nstability on experimental parameters, can be explained within a hydrodynamic\napproach. More specifically, many important properties can already be derived\nfrom an analysis of bubble wall dynamics. This dynamics is conveniently\ndescribed by the Rayleigh-Plesset (RP) equation. In this work we derive\nanalytical approximations for RP dynamics and subsequent analytical laws for\nparameter dependences. These results include (i) an expression for the onset\nthreshold of SL, (ii) an analytical explanation of the transition from\ndiffusively unstable to stable equilibria for the bubble ambient radius\n(unstable and stable sonoluminescence), and (iii) a detailed understanding of\nthe resonance structure of the RP equation. It is found that the threshold for\nSL emission is shifted to larger bubble radii and larger driving pressures if\nsurface tension is enlarged, whereas even a considerable change in liquid\nviscosity leaves this threshold virtually unaltered. As an enhanced viscosity\nstabilizes the bubbles against surface oscillations, we conclude that the ideal\nliquid for violently collapsing, surface stable SL bubbles should have small\nsurface tension and large viscosity, although too large viscosity (>40 times\nthe viscosity of water) will again preclude collapses.\n", "  A systematic theory for the scaling of the Nusselt number $Nu$ and of the\nReynolds number $Re$ in strong Rayleigh-Benard convection is suggested and\nshown to be compatible with recent experiments. It assumes a coherent large\nscale convection roll (``wind of turbulence'') and is based on the dynamical\nequations both in the bulk and in the boundary layers. Several regimes are\nidentified in the Rayleigh number versus Prandtl number phase space, defined by\nwhether the boundary layer or the bulk dominates the global kinetic and thermal\ndissipation, respectively. The crossover between the regimes is calculated. In\nthe regime which has most frequently been studied in experiment (Ra smaller\nthan 10^{11}) the leading terms are $Nu\\sim Ra^{1/4}Pr^{1/8}$, $Re \\sim\nRa^{1/2} Pr^{-3/4}$ for $Pr < 1$ and $Nu\\sim Ra^{1/4}Pr^{-1/12}$, $Re \\sim\nRa^{1/2} Pr^{-5/6}$ for $Pr > 1$. In most measurements these laws are modified\nby additive corrections from the neighboring regimes so that the impression of\na slightly larger (effective) Nu vs Ra scaling exponent can arise. -- The\npresented theory is best summarized in the phase diagram figure 1.\n", "  Burgers turbulence subject to a force $f(x,t)=\\sum_jf_j(x)\\delta(t-t_j)$,\nwhere the $t_j$'s are ``kicking times'' and the ``impulses'' $f_j(x)$ have\narbitrary space dependence, combines features of the purely decaying and the\ncontinuously forced cases. With large-scale forcing this ``kicked'' Burgers\nturbulence presents many of the regimes proposed by E, Khanin, Mazel and Sinai\n(1997) for the case of random white-in-time forcing. It is also amenable to\nefficient numerical simulations in the inviscid limit, using a modification of\nthe Fast Legendre Transform method developed for decaying Burgers turbulence by\nNoullez and Vergassola (1994). For the kicked case, concepts such as\n``minimizers'' and ``main shock'', which play crucial roles in recent\ndevelopments for forced Burgers turbulence, become elementary since everything\ncan be constructed from simple two-dimensional area-preserving Euler--Lagrange\nmaps.\n  One key result is for the case of identical deterministic kicks which are\nperiodic and analytic in space and are applied periodically in time: the\nprobability densities of large negative velocity gradients and of\n(not-too-large) negative velocity increments follow the power law with -7/2\nexponent proposed by E {\\it et al}. (1997) in the inviscid limit, whose\nexistence is still controversial in the case of white-in-time forcing. (More in\nthe full-length abstract at the beginning of the paper.)\n", "  The one dimensional Burgers equation in the inviscid limit with white noise\ninitial condition is revisited. The one- and two-point distributions of the\nBurgers field as well as the related distributions of shocks are obtained in\nclosed analytical forms. In particular, the large distance behavior of spatial\ncorrelations of the field is determined. Since higher order distributions\nfactorize in terms of the one and two points functions, our analysis provides\nan explicit and complete statistical description of this problem.\n", "  A Riemann problem with prescribed initial conditions will produce one of\nthree possible wave patterns corresponding to the propagation of the different\ndiscontinuities that will be produced once the system is allowed to relax. In\ngeneral, when solving the Riemann problem numerically, the determination of the\nspecific wave pattern produced is obtained through some initial guess which can\nbe successively discarded or improved. We here discuss a new procedure,\nsuitable for implementation in an exact Riemann solver in one dimension, which\nremoves the initial ambiguity in the wave pattern. In particular we focus our\nattention on the relativistic velocity jump between the two initial states and\nuse this to determine, through some analytic conditions, the wave pattern\nproduced by the decay of the initial discontinuity. The exact Riemann problem\nis then solved by means of calculating the root of a nonlinear equation.\nInterestingly, in the case of two rarefaction waves, this root can even be\nfound analytically. Our procedure is straightforward to implement numerically\nand improves the efficiency of numerical codes based on exact Riemann solvers.\n", "  Processing the data from a large variety of zero-pressure-gradient boundary\nlayer flows shows that the Reynolds-number-dependent scaling law, which the\npresent authors obtained earlier for pipes, gives an accurate description of\nthe velocity distribution in a self-similar intermediate region of distances\nfrom the wall adjacent to the viscous sublayer. The appropriate length scale\nthat enters the definition of the boundary layer Reynolds number is found for\nall the flows under investigation.\n  Another intermediate self-similar region between the free stream and the\nfirst intermediate region is found under conditions of weak free stream\nturbulence. The effects of turbulence in the free stream and of wall roughness\nare assessed, and conclusions are drawn.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of nonlinear pattern formation in parametric\nsurface waves for fluids of low viscosity, and in the limit of large aspect\nratio. The analysis is based on a quasi-potential approximation to the\nequations governing fluid motion, followed by a multiscale asymptotic expansion\nin the distance away from threshold. Close to onset, the asymptotic expansion\nyields an amplitude equation which is of gradient form, and allows the explicit\ncalculation of the functional form of the cubic nonlinearities. In particular,\nwe find that three-wave resonant interactions contribute significantly to the\nnonlinear terms, and therefore are important for pattern selection.\nMinimization of the associated Lyapunov functional predicts a primary\nbifurcation to a standing wave pattern of square symmetry for\ncapillary-dominated surface waves, in agreement with experiments. In addition,\nwe find that patterns of hexagonal and quasi-crystalline symmetry can be\nstabilized in certain mixed capillary-gravity waves, even in this case of\nsingle frequency forcing. Quasi-crystalline patterns are predicted in a region\nof parameters readily accessible experimentally.\n", "  Using a matched asymptotic expansion we analyze the two-dimensional, near-\ncritical reflection of a weakly nonlinear, internal gravity wave from a sloping\nboundary in a uniformly stratified fluid. Taking a distinguished limit in which\nthe amplitude of the incident wave, the dissipation, and the departure from\ncriticality are all small, we obtain a reduced description of the dynamics.\nThis simplification shows how either dissipation or transience heals the\nsingularity which is presented by the classical solution in the precisely\ncritical case. In the inviscid critical case, an explicit solution of the\ninitial value problem shows that the buoyancy perturbation and the along-slope\nvelocity both grow linearly with time, while the scale of the reflected\ndisturbance is reduced as $1/t$. During the course of this scale reduction, the\nstratification is `overturned' and the Miles-Howard condition for stratified\nshear flow stability is violated. However, for all slope angles, the\n`overturning' occurs before the Miles-Howard stability condition is violated\nand so we argue that the first instability is convective. Solutions of the\nsimplified dynamics resemble certain experimental visualizations of the\nreflection process.\n", "  Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection in horizontal layers of binary fluid mixtures\nheated from below with realistic horizontal boundary conditions is studied\ntheoretically using multi-mode Galerkin expansions. For positive separation\nratios the main difference between the mixtures and pure fluids lies in the\nexistence of stable three dimensional patterns near onset in a wide range of\nthe parameter space. We evaluated the stationary solutions of roll, crossroll,\nand square convection and we determined the location of the stability\nboundaries for many parameter combinations thereby obtaining the Busse balloon\nfor roll and square patterns.\n", "  This work is devoted to the decay ofrandom solutions of the unforced Burgers\nequation in one dimension in the limit of vanishing viscosity. The initial\nvelocity is homogeneous and Gaussian with a spectrum proportional to $k^n$ at\nsmall wavenumbers $k$ and falling off quickly at large wavenumbers. In physical\nspace, at sufficiently large distances, there is an ``outer region'', where the\nvelocity correlation function preserves exactly its initial form (a power law)\nwhen $n$ is not an even integer. When $1<n<2$ the spectrum, at long times, has\nthree scaling regions : first, a $|k|^n$ region at very small $k$\\ms1 with a\ntime-independent constant, stemming from this outer region, in which the\ninitial conditions are essentially frozen; second, a $k^2$ region at\nintermediate wavenumbers, related to a self-similarly evolving ``inner region''\nin physical space and, finally, the usual $k^{-2}$ region, associated to the\nshocks. The switching from the $|k|^n$ to the $k^2$ region occurs around a wave\nnumber $k_s(t) \\propto t^{-1/[2(2-n)]}$, while the switching from $k^2$ to\n$k^{-2}$ occurs around $k_L(t)\\propto t^{-1/2}$ (ignoring logarithmic\ncorrections in both instances). The key element in the derivation of the\nresults is an extension of the Kida (1979) log-corrected $1/t$ law for the\nenergy decay when $n=2$ to the case of arbitrary integer or non-integer $n>1$.\nA systematic derivation is given in which both the leading term and estimates\nof higher order corrections can be obtained. High-resolution numerical\nsimulations are presented which support our findings.\n", "  When two drops of radius $R$ touch, surface tension drives an initially\nsingular motion which joins them into a bigger drop with smaller surface area.\nThis motion is always viscously dominated at early times. We focus on the\nearly-time behavior of the radius $\\rmn$ of the small bridge between the two\ndrops. The flow is driven by a highly curved meniscus of length $2\\pi \\rmn$ and\nwidth $\\Delta\\ll\\rmn$ around the bridge, from which we conclude that the\nleading-order problem is asymptotically equivalent to its two-dimensional\ncounterpart. An exact two-dimensional solution for the case of inviscid\nsurroundings [Hopper, J. Fluid Mech. ${\\bf 213}$, 349 (1990)] shows that\n$\\Delta \\propto \\rmn^3$ and $\\rmn \\sim (t\\gamma/\\pi\\eta)\\ln [t\\gamma/(\\eta\nR)]$; and thus the same is true in three dimensions. The case of coalescence\nwith an external viscous fluid is also studied in detail both analytically and\nnumerically. A significantly different structure is found in which the outer\nfluid forms a toroidal bubble of radius $\\Delta \\propto \\rmn^{3/2}$ at the\nmeniscus and $\\rmn \\sim (t\\gamma/4\\pi\\eta) \\ln [t\\gamma/(\\eta R)]$. This basic\ndifference is due to the presence of the outer fluid viscosity, however small.\nWith lengths scaled by $R$ a full description of the asymptotic flow for\n$\\rmn(t)\\ll1$ involves matching of lengthscales of order $\\rmn^2, \\rmn^{3/2}$,\n\\rmn$, 1 and probably $\\rmn^{7/4}$.\n"]}
