In the light-cone coordinate\nsystem, these equations and relations have a normal and neat form which is much\naccessible than the usual Einstein field equation. So they may be helpful for\nstudents to study general relativity and for researchers to do further\ndiscussion.\n", "  Two methods to change a quantum harmonic oscillator frequency without\ntransitions in a finite time are described and compared. The first method, a\ntransitionless-tracking algorithm, makes use of a generalized harmonic\noscillator and a non-local potential. The second method, based on engineering\nan invariant of motion, only modifies the harmonic frequency in time, keeping\nthe potential local at all times.\n", "  Massive spectroscopic redshift surveys open a promising window to accurately\nmeasure peculiar velocity at cosmological distances through redshift space\ndistortion (RSD). In paper I of this series of work we proposed to decompose\npeculiar velocity into three eigen-modes (v_\\delta, v_S and v_B) in order to\nfacilitate the RSD modeling and peculiar velocity reconstruction. In the\ncurrent paper we measure the dark matter RSD related statistics of the velocity\neigen-modes through a set of N-body simulations, including the velocity power\nspectra, correlation functions, one-point probability distribution functions,\ncumulants and the damping functions describing the Finger of God effect. (1)\nThe power spectrum measurement shows that these velocity components have\ndistinctly different spatial distribution and redshift evolution. In\nparticular, we measure the window function \\tilde{W}(k,z), which describes the\nimpact of nonlinear evolution on the v_\\delta-density relation. We confirm that\nit can induce a significant systematic error of O(10%) in RSD cosmology. We\ndemonstrate that \\tilde{W} can be accurately described by a simple fitting\nformula with one or two free parameters. (2) The correlation function\nmeasurement shows that the correlation length is O(100), O(10) and O(1) Mpc for\nv_\\delta, v_S and v_B respectively. These correlation lengths determine where\nwe can treat the velocity fields as spatially uncorrelated. (3) The velocity\nPDFs and cumulants quantify non-Gaussianities of the velocity fields. We\nconfirm speculation in paper I that v_\\delta is largely Gaussian, nevertheless\nwith non-negligible non-Gaussianity, v_B is significantly non-Gaussian. We also\nmeasure the damping functions. Despite the observed non-Gaussianities, the\ndamping functions and hence the FOG effect are all well approximated as\nGaussian ones at scales of interest.\n", "  In this paper we present the following quantum compression protocol:\n  P : Let $\\rho,\\sigma$ be quantum states such that $S(\\rho || \\sigma) =\n\\text{Tr} (\\rho \\log \\rho - \\rho \\log \\sigma)$, the relative entropy between\n$\\rho$ and $\\sigma$, is finite. Alice gets to know the eigen-decomposition of\n$\\rho$. Bob gets to know the eigen-decomposition of $\\sigma$. Both Alice and\nBob know $S(\\rho || \\sigma)$ and an error parameter $\\epsilon$. Alice and Bob\nuse shared entanglement and after communication of $\\mathcal{O}((S(\\rho ||\n\\sigma)+1)/\\epsilon^4)$ bits from Alice to Bob, Bob ends up with a quantum\nstate $\\tilde{\\rho}$ such that $F(\\rho, \\tilde{\\rho}) \\geq 1 - 5\\epsilon$,\nwhere $F(\\cdot)$ represents fidelity.\n  This result can be considered as a non-commutative generalization of a result\ndue to Braverman and Rao [2011] where they considered the special case when\n$\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ are classical probability distributions (or commute with\neach other) and use shared randomness instead of shared entanglement. We use P\nto obtain an alternate proof of a direct-sum result for entanglement assisted\nquantum one-way communication complexity for all relations, which was first\nshown by Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen [2005,2008]. We also present a variant of\nprotocol P in which Bob has some side information about the state with Alice.\nWe show that in such a case, the amount of communication can be further\nreduced, based on the side information that Bob has.\n  Our second result provides a quantum analogue of the widely used classical\ncorrelated-sampling protocol. For example, Holenstein [2007] used the classical\ncorrelated-sampling protocol in his proof of a parallel-repetition theorem for\ntwo-player one-round games.\n", "  There exists a growing literature on the so-called physical Church-Turing\nthesis in a relativistic spacetime setting. The physical Church-Turing thesis\nis the conjecture that no computing device that is physically realizable (even\nin principle) can exceed the computational barriers of a Turing machine. By\nsuggesting a concrete implementation of a beyond-Turing computer in a spacetime\nsetting, Istv\\'an N\\'emeti and Gyula D\\'avid (2006) have shown how an\nappreciation of the physical Church-Turing thesis necessitates the confluence\nof mathematical, computational, physical, and indeed cosmological ideas. In\nthis essay, I will honour Istv\\'an's seventieth birthday, as well as his\nlongstanding interest in, and his seminal contributions to, this field going\nback to as early as 1987 by modestly proposing how the concrete implementation\nin N\\'emeti and D\\'avid (2006) might be complemented by a\nquantum-information-theoretic communication protocol between the computing\ndevice and the logician who sets the beyond-Turing computer a task such as\ndetermining the consistency of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. This suggests that\neven the foundations of quantum theory and, ultimately, quantum gravity may\nplay an important role in determining the validity of the physical\nChurch-Turing thesis.\n", "  This paper is the third part of a trilogy dedicated to the following problem:\ngiven spherically symmetric characteristic initial data for the\nEinstein-Maxwell-scalar field system with a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$,\nwith the data on the outgoing initial null hypersurface given by a subextremal\nReissner-Nordstrom black hole event horizon, study the future extendibility of\nthe corresponding maximal globally hyperbolic development as a \"suitably\nregular\" Lorentzian manifold.\n  In the first part of this series we established the well posedness of the\ncharacteristic problem, whereas in the second part we studied the stability of\nthe radius function at the Cauchy horizon.\n  In this third and final paper we show that, depending on the decay rate of\nthe initial data, mass inflation may or may not occur. When the mass is\ncontrolled, it is possible to obtain continuous extensions of the metric across\nthe Cauchy horizon with square integrable Christoffel symbols. Under slightly\nstronger conditions, we can bound the gradient of the scalar field. This allows\nthe construction of (non-isometric) extensions of the maximal development which\nare classical solutions of the Einstein equations. Our results provide evidence\nagainst the validity of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture when\n$\\Lambda>0$.\n", "  Exact diagonalization techniques are a powerful method for studying many-body\nproblems. Here, we apply this method to systems of few bosons in an optical\nlattice, and use it to demonstrate the emergence of interesting quantum\nphenomena like fragmentation and coherence. Starting with a standard\nBose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we first revise the characterization of the\nsuperfluid to Mott insulator transitions. We then consider an inhomogeneous\nlattice, where one potential minimum is made much deeper than the others. The\nMott insulator phase due to repulsive on-site interactions then competes with\nthe trapping of all atoms in the deep potential. Finally, we turn our attention\nto attractively interacting systems, and discuss the appearance of strongly\ncorrelated phases and the onset of localization for a slightly biased lattice.\nThe article is intended to serve as a tutorial for exact diagonalization of\nBose-Hubbard models.\n", "  The Ostrogradski approach for the Hamiltonian formalism of higher derivative\ntheory is not satisfactory because of the reason that the Lagrangian cannot be\nviewed as a function on the tangent bundle to coordinate manifold. In this\narticle, we have used an alternative approach which leads directly to the\nLagrangian which, being a function on the tangent manifold, gives correct\nequation of motion; no new coordinate variables need to be added. This approach\ncan be directly used to the singular (in Ostrogradski sense) Lagrangian. We\nhave used this method for the Regge Teitelboim (RT) minisuperspace cosmological\nmodel. We have obtained the Hamiltonian of the dynamical equation of the scale\nfactor of RT model.\n", "  Knowledge of all correlation functions of a system is equivalent to solving\nthe corresponding many-body problem. Already a finite set of correlation\nfunctions can be sufficient to describe a quantum many-body system if\ncorrelations factorise, at least approximately. While being a powerful\ntheoretical concept, an implementation based on experimental data has so far\nremained elusive. Here, this is achieved by applying it to a non-trivial\nquantum many-body problem: A pair of tunnel-coupled one-dimensional atomic\nsuperfluids. From measured interference patterns we extract phase correlation\nfunctions up to tenth order and analyse if, and under which conditions, they\nfactorise. This characterises the essential features of the system, the\nrelevant quasiparticles, their interactions and possible topologically distinct\nvacua. We verify that in thermal equilibrium the physics can be described by\nthe quantum sine-Gordon model, relevant for a wide variety of disciplines from\nparticle to condensed-matter physics. Our experiment establishes a general\nmethod to analyse quantum many-body systems in experiments. It represents a\ncrucial ingredient towards the implementation and verification of quantum\nsimulators.\n", "  We prove quantum ergodicity for certain orthonormal bases of\n$L^2(\\mathbb{S}^2)$, consisting of joint eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on\n$\\mathbb{S}^2$ and the discrete averaging operator over a finite set of\nrotations, generating a free group. If in addition the rotations are algebraic\nwe give a quantified version of this result. The methods used also give a new,\nsimplified proof of quantum ergodicity for large regular graphs.\n", "  This paper generalizes existing approaches for free-surface wave damping via\nmomentum sinks for flow simulations based on the Navier-Stokes equations. It is\nshown in 2D flow simulations that, to obtain reliable wave damping, the\ncoefficients in the damping functions must be adjusted to the wave parameters.\nA scaling law for selecting these damping coefficients is presented, which\nenables similarity of the damping in model- and full-scale. The influence of\nthe thickness of the damping layer, the wave steepness, the mesh fineness and\nthe choice of the damping coefficients are examined. An efficient approach for\nestimating the optimal damping setup is presented. Results of 3D ship\nresistance computations show that the scaling laws apply to such simulations as\nwell, so the damping coefficients should be adjusted for every simulation to\nensure convergence of the solution in both model and full scale. Finally,\npractical recommendations for the setup of reliable damping in flow simulations\nwith regular and irregular free surface waves are given.\n", "  We use generalized unitarity at the integrand-level to directly construct\nlocal, manifestly dual-conformally invariant formulae for all two-loop\nscattering amplitudes in planar, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory\n(SYM). This representation separates contributions into manifestly finite and\ndivergent terms---in a way that makes manifest the exponentiation of infrared\ndivergences at the integrand-level. These results perfectly match the all-loop\nBCFW recursion relations, to which we provide a closed-form solution valid\nthrough two-loop-order. Finally, we describe and document a Mathematica package\nwhich implements these results, available as part of this work's source files\non the arXiv.\n", "  We present new solitarywave solutions of the two-dimensional nonlinear\nSchrodinger equation on bounded domains (such as rectangles, circles, and\nannuli). These multipeak necklace solitary waves consist of several identical\npositive profiles (pearls), such that adjacent pearls have opposite signs. They\nare stable at low powers, but become unstable at powers well below the critical\npower for collapse Pcr. This is in contrast with the ground-state\n(single-pearl) solitary waves on bounded domains, which are stable at any power\nbelow Pcr. On annular domains, the ground state solitary waves are radial at\nlow powers, but undergo a symmetry breaking at a threshold power well below\nPcr. As in the case of convex bounded domains, necklace solitary waves on the\nannulus are stable at low powers and become unstable at powers well below Pcr.\nUnlike on convex bounded domains, however, necklace solitarywaves on the\nannulus have a second stability regime at powers well above Pcr. For example,\nwhen the ratio of the inner to outer radii is 1:2, four-pearl necklaces are\nstable when their power is between 3.1Pcr and 3.7Pcr. This finding opens the\npossibility to propagate localized laser beams with substantiallymore power\nthan was possible until now. The instability of necklace solitary waves is\nexcited by perturbations that break the antisymmetry between adjacent pearls,\nand is manifested by power transfer between pearls. In particular, necklace\ninstability is unrelated to collapse. In order to compute numerically the\nprofile of necklace solitary waves on bounded domains, we introduce a\nnon-spectral variant of Petviashvilis renormalization method.\n", "  We establish rigorous error bounds for approximating correlation functions of\nconformal field theories (CFTs) by certain finite-dimensional tensor networks.\nFor chiral CFTs, the approximation takes the form of a matrix product state.\nFor full CFTs consisting of a chiral and an anti-chiral part, the approximation\nis given by a finitely correlated state. We show that the bond dimension scales\npolynomially in the inverse of the approximation error and sub-exponentially in\nthe ultraviolett cutoff. We illustrate our findings using Wess-Zumino-Witten\nmodels, and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between\ngroup-covariant MPS and our approximation.\n", "  We propose a new method to probe a possible time evolution of the fine\nstructure constant $\\alpha$ from X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich measurements of\nthe gas mass fraction ($f_{gas}$) in galaxy clusters. Taking into account a\ndirect relation between variations of $\\alpha$ and violations of the\ndistance-duality relation, we discuss constraints on $\\alpha$ for a class of\ndilaton runaway models. Although not yet competitive with bounds from high-$z$\nquasar absorption systems, our constraints, considering a sample of 29\nmeasurements of $f_{gas}$, in the redshift interval $0.14 < z < 0.89$, provide\nan independent estimate of $\\alpha$ variation at low and intermediate\nredshifts. Furthermore, current and planned surveys will provide a larger\namount of data and thus allow to improve the limits on $\\alpha$ variation\nobtained in the present analysis.\n", "  In force sensing, optomechanics, and quantum motion experiments, it is\ntypically advantageous to create lightweight, compliant mechanical elements\nwith the lowest possible force noise. Here we report wafer-scale batch\nfabrication and characterization of high-aspect-ratio, nanogram-scale\nSi$_3$N$_4$ \"trampolines\" having quality factors above $4 \\times 10^7$ and\nringdown times exceeding five minutes (1 mHz linewidth). We measure a thermally\nlimited force noise sensitivity of 16.2$\\pm$0.8 aN/Hz$^{1/2}$ at room\ntemperature, with a spring constant ($\\sim$1 N/m) 2-5 orders of magnitude\nlarger than those of competing technologies. We also characterize the\nsuitability of these devices for high-finesse cavity readout and optomechanics\napplications, finding no evidence of surface or bulk optical losses from the\nprocessed nitride in a cavity achieving finesse 40,000. These parameters\nprovide access to a single-photon cooperativity $C_0 \\sim 8$ in the\nresolved-sideband limit, wherein a variety of outstanding optomechanics goals\nbecome feasible.\n", "  Inspired by a question of Colin de Verdi\\`{e}re and Truc we study the\ndynamics of a classical charged particle moving in a bounded planar domain\n$\\Omega$ under the influence of a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ which blows up at\nthe boundary of the domain. We prove that under appropriate blow-up conditions\nthe particle will never reach the boundary. As a corollary we obtain\ncompleteness of the magnetic flow. Our blow-up condition is that $\\mathbf{B}$\nshould not be integrable along normal rays to the boundary, while its\ntangential derivative should be integrable along those same rays.\n", "  Spent nuclear fuel (SNF) antineutrino flux is an important source of\nuncertainties for a reactor neutrino flux prediction. However, if one want to\ndetermine the contribution of spent fuel, many data are needed, such as the\namount of spent fuel in the pool, the time after discharged from the reactor\ncore, the burnup of each assembly, and the antineutrino spectrum of the\nisotopes in the spend fuel. A method to calculate the contribution of SNF is\nproposed in this study. In this method, reactor simulation code verified by\nexperiment have been used to simulate the fuel depletion by taking into account\nmore than 2000 isotopes and fission products, the quantity of SNF in each six\nspend fuel pool, and the antineutrino spectrum of SNF varying with time after\nSNF discharged from core. Results show that the contribution of SNF to the\ntotal antineutrino flux is about 0.26%~0.34%, and the shutdown impact is about\n20%. The SNF spectrum would distort the softer part of antineutrino spectra,\nand the maximum contribution from SNF is about 3.0%, but there is 18\\%\ndifference between line evaluate method and under evaluate method. In addition,\nnon-equilibrium effects are also discussed, and the results are compatible with\ntheirs considering the uncertainties.\n", "  In this paper we investigate a general class of linear viscoelastic models\nwhose creep and relaxation memory functions are expressed in Laplace domain by\nsuitable ratios of modified Bessel functions of contiguous order. In time\ndomain these functions are shown to be expressed by Dirichlet series (that is\ninfinite Prony series). It follows that the corresponding creep compliance and\nrelaxation modulus turn out to be characterized by infinite discrete spectra of\nretardation and relaxation time respectively. As a matter of fact, we get a\nclass of viscoelastic models depending on a real parameter $\\nu > -1$. Such\nmodels exhibit rheological properties akin to those of a fractional Maxwell\nmodel (of order $1/2$) for short times and of a standard Maxwell model for long\ntimes.\n", "  For a toric Fano manifold $X$ denote by $Crit(X) \\subset\n(\\mathbb{C}^{\\ast})^n$ the solution scheme of the Landau-Ginzburg system of\nequations of $X$. Examples of toric Fano manifolds with $rk(Pic(X)) \\leq 3$\nwhich admit full strongly exceptional collections of line bundles were recently\nfound by various authors. For these examples we construct a map $E : Crit(X)\n\\rightarrow Pic(X)$ whose image $\\mathcal{E}=\\left \\{ E(z) \\vert z \\in Crit(X)\n\\right \\}$ is a full strongly exceptional collection satisfying the M-aligned\nproperty. That is, under this map, the groups $Hom(E(z),E(w))$ for $z,w \\in\nCrit(X)$ are naturally related to the structure of the monodromy group acting\non $Crit(X)$.\n", "  We consider the diffusion of new products in social networks, where consumers\nwho adopt the product can later \"recover\" and stop influencing others to adopt\nthe product. We show that the diffusion is not described by the SIR model, but\nrather by a novel model, the Bass-SIR model, which combines the Bass model for\ndiffusion of new products with the SIR model for epidemics. The phase\ntransition of consumers from non-adopters to adopters is described by a\nnon-standard Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model, in which clusters growth is\nlimited by adopters' recovery. Therefore, diffusion in the Bass-SIR model only\ndepends on the local structure of the social network, but not on the average\ndistance between consumers. Consequently, unlike the SIR model, a small-worlds\nstructure has a negligible effect on the diffusion. Surprisingly, diffusion on\nscale-free networks is nearly identical to that on Cartesian ones.\n", "  In this paper, using the formula for the integrals of the $\\psi$-classes over\nthe double ramification cycles found by S. Shadrin, L. Spitz, D. Zvonkine and\nthe author, we derive a new explicit formula for the $n$-point function of the\nintersection numbers on the moduli space of curves.\n", "  Using the standard Vicsek model, I show how the macroscopic transport\nequations can be systematically derived from microscopic collision rules. The\napproach starts with the exact evolution equation for the N-particle\nprobability distribution, and after making the mean-field assumption of\nMolecular Chaos leads to a multi-particle Enskog-type equation. This equation\nis treated by a non-standard Chapman-Enskog expansion to extract the\nmacroscopic behavior. The expansion includes terms up to third order in a\nformal expansion parameter $\\epsilon$, and involves a fast time scale. A\nself-consistent closure of the moment equations is presented that leads to a\ncontinuity equation for the particle density and a Navier-Stokes-like equation\nfor the momentum density. Expressions for all transport coefficients in these\nmacroscopic equations are given explicitly in terms of microscopic parameters\nof the model. The transport coefficients depend on specific angular integrals\nwhich are evaluated asymptotically in the limit of infinitely many collision\npartners, using an analogy to a random walk. The consistency of the\nChapman-Enskog approach is checked by an independent calculation of the shear\nviscosity using a Green-Kubo relation.\n", "  Tensor networks are efficient representations of high-dimensional tensors\nwhich have been very successful for physics and mathematics applications. We\ndemonstrate how algorithms for optimizing such networks can be adapted to\nsupervised learning tasks by using matrix product states (tensor trains) to\nparameterize models for classifying images. For the MNIST data set we obtain\nless than 1% test set classification error. We discuss how the tensor network\nform imparts additional structure to the learned model and suggest a possible\ngenerative interpretation.\n", "  Nonlinear manipulation of nuclear and electron spins is the basis for all\nadvanced methods in magnetic resonance including multidimensional nuclear\nmagnetic and electron spin resonance spectroscopies, magnetic resonance\nimaging, and in recent years, quantum control over individual spins. The\nmethodology is facilitated by the ease with which the regime of strong coupling\ncan be reached between radiofrequency or microwave magnetic fields and nuclear\nor electron spins respectively, typified by sequences of magnetic pulses that\ncontrol the magnetic moment directions. The capabilities meet a bottleneck,\nhowever, for far-infrared magnetic resonances characteristic of correlated\nelectron materials, molecular magnets, and proteins that contain high-spin\ntransition metal ions. Here we report the development of two-dimensional\nterahertz magnetic resonance spectroscopy and its use for direct observation of\nthe nonlinear responses of collective spin waves (magnons). The spectra show\nmagnon spin echoes and 2-quantum signals that reveal pairwise correlations\nbetween magnons at the Brillouin zone center. They also show resonance-enhanced\nsecond-harmonic and difference-frequency signals. Our methods are readily\ngeneralizable to multidimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy and nonlinear\ncoherent control of terahertz-frequency spin systems in molecular complexes,\nbiomolecules, and materials.\n", "  We carried out a photometric and structural analysis in the rest-frame $V$\nband of a mass-selected ($\\log M/M_\\odot >10.7$) sample of red-sequence\ngalaxies in 14 galaxy clusters, 6 of which are at $z>1.45$. To this end, we\nreduced/analyzed about 300 orbits of multicolor images taken with the Advanced\nCamera for Survey and the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope. We\nuniformly morphologically classified galaxies from $z=0.023$ to $z=1.803$, and\nwe homogeneously derived sizes (effective radii) for the entire sample.\nFurthermore, our size derivation allows, and therefore is not biased by, the\npresence of the usual variety of morphological structures seen in early-type\ngalaxies, such as bulges, bars, disks, isophote twists, and ellipiticy\ngradients. By using such a mass-selected sample, composed of 244 red-sequence\nearly-type galaxies, we find that the $\\log$ of the galaxy size at a fixed\nstellar mass, $\\log M/M_\\odot= 11$ has increased with time at a rate of\n$0.023\\pm0.002$ dex per Gyr over the last 10 Gyr, in marked contrast with the\nthreefold increase found in the literature for galaxies in the general field\nover the same period. This suggests, at face value, that secular processes\nshould be excluded as the primary drivers of size evolution because we observed\nan environmental environmental dependent size growth. Using spectroscopic ages\nof Coma early-type galaxies we also find that recently quenched early-type\ngalaxies are a numerically minor population not different enough in size to\nalter the mean size at a given mass, which implies that the progenitor bias is\nminor, i.e., that the size evolution measured by selecting galaxies at the\nredshift of observation is indistinguishable from the one that compares\nancestors and descendents.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the dynamics of modulation instability (MI) in\ntwo-dimensional spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The\nanalysis is performed for equal densities of pseudo-spin components. Different\ncombination of the signs of intra- and inter-component interaction strengths\nare considered, with a particular emphasize on repulsive interactions. We\nobserve that the unstable modulation builds from originally miscible\ncondensates, depending on the combination of the signs of the intra- and\ninter-component interaction strengths. The repulsive intra- and inter-component\ninteractions admit instability and the MI immiscibility condition is no longer\nsignificant. Influence of interaction parameters such as spin-orbit and Rabi\ncoupling on MI are also investigated. The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) inevitably\ncontributes to instability regardless of the nature of the interaction. In the\ncase of attractive interaction, SOC manifest in enhancing the MI. Thus, a\ncomprehensive study of MI in two-dimensional spin-orbit coupled binary BECs of\npseudo-spin components is presented.\n", "  We determine quark mass dependent order $a$ improvement terms of the form\n$b_Jam$ for non-singlet scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axialvector currents\nusing correlators in coordinate space on a set of CLS ensembles. These have\nbeen generated employing non-perturbatively improved Wilson Fermions and the\ntree-level L\\\"uscher-Weisz gauge action at $\\beta = 3.4, 3.46, 3.55$ and $3.7$,\ncorresponding to lattice spacings ranging from $a \\approx 0.085$ fm down to\n$0.05$ fm. In the $N_f=2+1$ flavour theory two types of improvement\ncoefficients exist: $b_J$, proportional to non-singlet quark mass combinations,\nand $\\bar{b}_J$ (or $\\tilde{b}_J$), proportional to the trace of the quark mass\nmatrix. Combining our non-perturbative determinations with perturbative\nresults, we quote Pad\\'e approximants parameterizing the $b_J$ improvement\ncoefficients within the above window of lattice spacings. We also give\npreliminary results for $\\tilde{b}_J$ at $\\beta=3.4$.\n", "  Previously, the graph permanent was introduced as a single-valued invariant\nfor graphs $G$ with $|E(G)| = k(|V(G)|-1)$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.\nHerein, we construct the extended graph permanent, an infinite sequence for all\ngraphs. We prove that, like the graph permanent, the extended graph permanent\nis invariant under the graph operations that are known to preserve the period.\nFurther, the original construction and extension arise from permanents of\nmatrices, but we construct a novel graph polynomial such that the sequence can\nbe generated from the point count of this polynomial, as a residue over\nprime-order finite fields.\n", "  In this study, the dynamics of a dissipationless incompressible Hall\nmagnetohydrodynamic (HMHD) medium are formulated as geodesics on a direct\nproduct of two volume-preserving diffeomorphism groups. Formulations are given\nfor the geodesic and Jacobi equations based on a linear connection with\nphysically desirable properties, which agrees with the Levi-Civita connection.\nDerivations of the explicit normal-mode expressions for the Riemannian metric,\nLevi-Civita connection, and related formulae and equations are also provided\nusing the generalized Els\\\"asser variables (GEVs). Examinations of the\nstabilities of the hydrodynamic (HD, $\\alpha=0$) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD,\n$\\alpha\\to0$) motions and the $O(\\alpha)$ Hall-term effect in terms of the\nJacobi equation and the Riemannian sectional curvature tensor are presented,\nwhere $\\alpha$ represents the Hall-term strength parameter. It is very\ninteresting that the sectional curvatures of the MHD and HMHD systems between\ntwo GEV modes were found to take both the positive (stable) and negative\n(unstable) values, while that of the HD system between two complex helical\nwaves was observed to be negative definite. Moreover, for the MHD case,\nnegative sectional curvatures were found to occur only when mode interaction\nwas \"local,\" i.e., the wavenumber moduli of the main flow (say $p$) and\nperturbation (say $k$) were close to each other ($k \\approx p$). However, in\nthe nonlocal limit ($k \\gg p$ or $k \\ll p$), the sectional curvatures were\nalways positive. This result leads to the conjecture that the MHD interactions\nmainly excite wavy or non-growing motions; however, some local interactions\ncause dynamical instability that leads to chaotic or turbulent plasma motions.\nAdditionally, it was found that the tendencies of the $O(\\alpha)$ effects are\nopposite between the ion cyclotron and whistler modes. Comparison with\nenergy-Casimir method is discussed.\n", "  We consider the conformally invariant cubic wave equation on the Einstein\ncylinder $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{S}^3$ for small rotationally symmetric\ninitial data. This simple equation captures many key challenges of nonlinear\nwave dynamics in confining geometries, while a conformal transformation relates\nit to a self-interacting conformally coupled scalar in four-dimensional anti-de\nSitter spacetime (AdS$_4$) and connects it to various questions of AdS\nstability. We construct an effective infinite-dimensional time-averaged\ndynamical system accurately approximating the original equation in the weak\nfield regime. It turns out that this effective system, which we call the\nconformal flow, exhibits some remarkable features, such as low-dimensional\ninvariant subspaces, a wealth of stationary states (for which energy does not\nflow between the modes), as well as solutions with nontrivial exactly periodic\nenergy flows. Based on these observations and close parallels to the cubic\nSzego equation, which was shown by Gerard and Grellier to be Lax-integrable, it\nis tempting to conjecture that the conformal flow and the corresponding weak\nfield dynamics in AdS$_4$ are integrable as well.\n", "  Second-order phase transitions have no latent heat and are characterized by a\nchange in symmetry. In addition to the conventional symmetric and\nanti-symmetric states under permutations of bosons and fermions, mathematical\ngroup-representation theory allows for non-Abelian permutation symmetry. Such\nsymmetry can be hidden in states with defined total spins of spinor gases,\nwhich can be formed in optical cavities. The present work shows that the\nsymmetry reveals itself in spin-independent or coordinate-independent\nproperties of these gases, namely as non-Abelian entropy in thermodynamic\nproperties. In weakly interacting Fermi gases, two phases appear associated\nwith fermionic and non-Abelian symmetry under permutations of particle states,\nrespectively. The second-order transitions between the phases are characterized\nby discontinuities in specific heat. Unlike other phase transitions, the\npresent ones are not caused by interactions and can appear even in ideal gases.\nSimilar effects in Bose gases and strong interactions are discussed.\n", "  An extension of the ideal hadron resonance gas (HRG) model is constructed\nwhich includes the attractive and repulsive van der Waals (VDW) interactions\nbetween baryons. This VDW-HRG model yields the nuclear liquid-gas transition at\nlow temperatures and high baryon densities. The VDW parameters $a$ and $b$ are\nfixed by the ground state properties of nuclear matter, and the temperature\ndependence of various thermodynamic observables at zero chemical potential are\ncalculated within VDW-HRG model. Compared to the ideal HRG model, the inclusion\nof VDW interactions between baryons leads to a qualitatively different behavior\nof second and higher moments of fluctuations of conserved charges, in\nparticular in the so-called crossover region $T\\sim 140 - 190$ MeV. For many\nobservables this behavior resembles closely the results obtained from lattice\nQCD simulations. This hadronic model also predicts nontrivial behavior of\nnet-baryon fluctuations in the region of phase diagram probed by heavy-ion\ncollision experiments. These results imply that VDW interactions play a crucial\nrole in thermodynamics of hadron gas. Thus, the commonly performed comparisons\nof the ideal HRG model with the lattice and heavy-ion data may lead to\nmisconceptions and misleading conclusions.\n", "  Unlike classical heat diffusion at the macroscale, nanoscale heat transport\ncan occur without energy dissipation because phonons can travel in straight\nlines for hundreds of nanometres. Despite recent experimental evidence of such\nballistic phonon transport, control over its directionality, and thus its\npractical use, remains a challenge, as the directions of individual phonons are\nchaotic. Here, we show a way to control the directionality of ballistic phonon\ntransport using silicon thin-films with arrays of holes. First, we demonstrate\nthe formation of directional heat fluxes in the passages between the holes.\nNext, we use these nanostructures as a directional source of ballistic phonons\nand couple the emitted phonons into nanowires. Finally, we introduce a\nnanoscale thermal lens in which the phonons converge at a focal point, thus\nfocusing heat into a spot of a few hundred nanometres. These results provide a\nbasis for ray-like heat manipulations that enable nanoscale heat guiding,\ndissipation, localization, confinement and rectification.\n", "  We give a capacity formula for the classical information transmission over a\nnoisy quantum channel, with separable encoding by the sender and limited\nresources provided by the receiver's pre-shared ancilla. Instead of a pure\nstate, we consider the signal-ancilla pair in a mixed state, purified by a\n\"witness\". Thus, the signal-witness correlation limits the resource available\nfrom the signal-ancilla correlation. Our formula characterizes the utility of\ndifferent forms of resources, including noisy or limited entanglement\nassistance, for classical communication. With separable encoding, the sender's\nsignals across multiple channel uses are still allowed to be entangled, yet our\ncapacity formula is additive. In particular, for generalized covariant channels\nour capacity formula has a simple closed-form. Moreover, our additive capacity\nformula upper bounds the general coherent attack's information gain in various\ntwo-way quantum key distribution protocols. For Gaussian protocols, the\nadditivity of the formula indicates that the collective Gaussian attack is the\nmost powerful.\n", "  Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are primarily used for sampling from a given\nprobability distribution and estimating multi-dimensional integrals based on\nthe information contained in the generated samples. Whenever it is possible,\nmore accurate estimates are obtained by combining Monte Carlo integration and\nintegration by numerical quadrature along particular coordinates. We show that\nthis variance reduction technique, referred to as conditioning in probability\ntheory, can be advantageously implemented in \\emph{expanded ensemble}\nsimulations. These simulations aim at estimating thermodynamic expectations as\na function of an external parameter that is sampled like an additional\ncoordinate. Conditioning therein entails integrating along the external\ncoordinate by numerical quadrature. We prove variance reduction with respect to\nalternative standard estimators and demonstrate the practical efficiency of the\ntechnique by estimating free energies and characterizing a structural phase\ntransition between two solid phases.\n", "  Advances in optical neuroimaging techniques now allow neural activity to be\nrecorded with cellular resolution in awake and behaving animals. Brain motion\nin these recordings pose a unique challenge. The location of individual neurons\nmust be tracked in 3D over time to accurately extract single neuron activity\ntraces. Recordings from small invertebrates like C. elegans are especially\nchallenging because they undergo very large brain motion and deformation during\nanimal movement. Here we present an automated computer vision pipeline to\nreliably track populations of neurons with single neuron resolution in the\nbrain of a freely moving C. elegans undergoing large motion and deformation. 3D\nvolumetric fluorescent images of the animal's brain are straightened, aligned\nand registered, and the locations of neurons in the images are found via\nsegmentation. Each neuron is then assigned an identity using a new\ntime-independent machine-learning approach we call Neuron Registration Vector\nEncoding. In this approach, non-rigid point-set registration is used to match\neach segmented neuron in each volume with a set of reference volumes taken from\nthroughout the recording. The way each neuron matches with the references\ndefines a feature vector which is clustered to assign an identity to each\nneuron in each volume. Finally, thin-plate spline interpolation is used to\ncorrect errors in segmentation and check consistency of assigned identities.\nThe Neuron Registration Vector Encoding approach proposed here is uniquely well\nsuited for tracking neurons in brains undergoing large deformations. When\napplied to whole-brain calcium imaging recordings in freely moving C. elegans,\nthis analysis pipeline located 150 neurons for the duration of an 8 minute\nrecording and consistently found more neurons more quickly than manual or\nsemi-automated approaches.\n", "  Zero-index materials exhibit exotic optical properties that can be utilized\nfor integrated-optics applications. However, practical implementation requires\ncompatibility with complementary metallic-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)\ntechnologies. We demonstrate a CMOS-compatible zero-index metamaterial\nconsisting of a square array of air holes in a 220-nm-thick\nsilicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. This design is achieved through a Dirac-cone\ndispersion. The metamaterial is entirely composed of silicon and offers\ncompatibility through low-aspect-ratio structures that can be simply fabricated\nin a standard device layer. This platform enables mass adoption and exploration\nof zero-index-based photonic devices at low cost and high fidelity.\n", "  We propose an information-theoretically secure encryption scheme for\nclassical messages with quantum ciphertexts that offers detection of\neavesdropping attacks, and re-usability of the key in case no eavesdropping\ntook place: the entire key can be securely re-used for encrypting new messages\nas long as no attack is detected. This is known to be impossible for fully\nclassical schemes, where there is no way to detect plain eavesdropping attacks.\nThis particular application of quantum techniques to cryptography was\noriginally proposed by Bennett, Brassard and Breidbart in 1982, even before\nproposing quantum-key-distribution, and a simple candidate scheme was suggested\nbut no rigorous security analysis was given. The idea was picked up again in\n2005, when Damgard, Pedersen and Salvail suggested a new scheme for the same\ntask, but now with a rigorous security analysis. However, their scheme is much\nmore demanding in terms of quantum capabilities: it requires the users to have\na quantum computer. In contrast, and like the original scheme by Bennett et\nal., our new scheme merely requires to prepare and measure single BB84 qubits.\nAs such, we not only show a provably-secure scheme that is within reach of\ncurrent technology, but we also confirm Bennett et al.'s original intuition\nthat a scheme in the spirit of their original construction is indeed secure.\n", "  In this paper we discuss a one parameter modification of the well known\nfractional Maxwell model of viscoelasticity. Such models appear to be\nparticularly interesting because they describe the short time asymptotic limit\nof a more general class of viscoelastic models known in the literature as\nBessel models.\n", "  Entanglement criteria for an $n$-partite quantum system with continuous\nvariables are formulated in terms of R\\'{e}nyi entropies. R\\'{e}nyi entropies\nare widely used as a good information measure due to many nice properties.\nDerived entanglement criteria are based on several mathematical results such as\nthe Hausdorff-Young inequality, Young's inequality for convolution and its\nconverse. From the historical viewpoint, the formulations of these results with\nsharp constants were obtained comparatively recently. Using the position and\nmomentum observables of subsystems, one can build two total-system measurements\nwith the following property. For product states, the final density in each\nglobal measurement appears as a convolution of $n$ local densities. Hence,\nrestrictions in terms of two R\\'{e}nyi entropies with constrained entropic\nindices are formulated for $n$-separable states of an $n$-partite quantum\nsystem with continuous variables. Experimental results are typically sampled\ninto bins between prescribed discrete points. For these aims, we give\nappropriate reformulations of the derived entanglement criteria.\n", "  We consider a Vicsek model of self-propelled particles with bounded\nconfidence, where each particle interacts only with neighbors that have a\nsimilar direction. Depending on parameters, the system exhibits a continuous or\ndiscontinuous polar phase transition from the isotropic phase to a phase with a\npreferred direction. In a recent paper [1] the von Mises distribution was\nproposed as an ansatz for polar ordering. In the present system the time\nevolution of the angular distribution can be solved in Fourier space. We\ncompare the results of the Fourier analysis with the ones obtained by using the\nvon Mises distribution ansatz. In the latter case the qualitative behavior of\nthe system is recovered correctly. However, quantitatively there are serious\ndeviations. We introduce an extended von Mises distribution ansatz such that a\nsecond term takes care of the next two Fourier modes. With the extended ansatz\nwe find much better quantitative agreement. As an alternative approach we also\nuse a Gaussian and a geometric series ansatz in Fourier space. The geometric\nseries ansatz is analytically handable but fails for very weak noise, the\nGaussian ansatz yields better results but it is not analytically treatable.\n", "  We theoretically propose a unifying expression for synchronization dynamics\nbetween two-level constituents. Although synchronization phenomena require some\nsubstantial mediators, the distinct repercussions of their propagation delays\nremain obscure, especially in open systems. Our scheme directly incorporates\nthe details of the constituents and mediators in an arbitrary environment. As\none example, we demonstrate the synchronization dynamics of optical emitters on\na dielectric microsphere. We reveal that the whispering gallery modes (WGMs)\nbridge the well-separated emitters and accelerate the synchronized\nfluorescence, known as superfluorescence. The emitters are found to overcome\nthe significant and nonuniform retardation, and to build up their pronounced\ncoherence by the WGMs, striking a balance between the roles of resonator and\nintermediary. Our work directly illustrates the dynamical aspects of many-body\nsynchronizations and contributes to the exploration of research paradigms that\nconsider designed open systems.\n", "  It has been argued that the recently detected ring-down gravity waveforms\ncould be indicative only of the presence of light rings in a horizonless\nobject, such as a surgical Schwarzschild wormhole, with the frequencies\ndiffering drastically from those of the horizon quasinormal mode frequencies\n$\\omega _{\\text{QNM}}$ at late times. While the possibility of such a\nhorizonless alternative is novel by itself, we show by the example of\nEllis-Bronnikov wormhole that the differences in $\\omega _{\\text{QNM}}$ in the\neikonal limit (large $l$) need not be drastic. This result will be reached by\nexploiting the connection between $\\omega _{\\text{QNM}}$ and the Bozza strong\nfield lensing parameters. We shall also show that the lensing observables of\nthe Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole can also be very close to those of a black hole\n(say, SgrA$^{\\ast }$ hosted by our galaxy) of the same mass. This situation\nindicates that the ring-down frequencies and lensing observables of the\nEllis-Bronnikov wormhole can remarkably mimic those of a black hole. The\nconstraint on wormhole parameter $\\gamma $ imposed by experimental accuracy is\nbriefly discussed. We also provide independent arguments supporting the\nstability of the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole proven recently.\n", "  We suggest a new left-right symmetric model implementing a low-scale seesaw\nmechanism in which quantum consistency requires three families of fermions. The\nsymmetry breaking route to the Standard Model determines the profile of the\n\"next\" expected new physics, characterized either by the simplest left-right\ngauge symmetry or by the 3-3-1 scenario. The resulting $Z^\\prime$ gauge bosons\ncan be probed at the LHC and provide a production portal for the right-handed\nneutrinos. On the other hand, its flavor changing interactions would affect the\nK, D and B neutral meson systems.\n", "  The uncertainty principle is considered to be one of the most striking\nfeatures in quantum mechanics. In the textbook literature, uncertainty\nrelations usually refer to the preparation uncertainty which imposes a\nlimitation on the spread of measurement outcomes for a pair of non-commuting\nobservables. In this work, we study the preparation uncertainty for the angular\nmomentum, especially in the spin-1/2 representation. We derive uncertainty\nrelations encompassing the triple components of angular momentum, and show that\ncompared with the relations involving only two components, a triple constant\n$2/\\sqrt{3}$ often arises. Intriguingly, this constant is the same for the\nposition and momentum case. Experimental verification is carried out on a\nsingle spin in diamond, and the results confirm the triple constant in a wide\nrange of experimental parameters.\n", "  We present the theory of time-dependent point transformations to find\nindependent dynamical normal modes for 2D systems subjected to time-dependent\ncontrol in the limit of small oscillations. The condition that determines if\nthe independent modes can indeed be defined is identified, and a geometrical\nanalogy is put forward. The results explain and unify recent work to design\nfast operations on trapped ions, needed to implement a scalable\nquantum-information architecture: transport, expansions, and the separation of\ntwo ions, two-ion phase gates, as well as the rotation of an anisotropic trap\nfor an ion are treated and shown to be analogous to a mechanical system of two\nmasses connected by springs with time dependent stiffness.\n", "  We develop a stochastic description of small-field inflationary histories\nwith a graceful exit in a random potential whose Hessian is a Gaussian random\nmatrix as a model of the unstructured part of the string landscape. The\ndynamical evolution in such a random potential from a small-field inflation\nregion towards a viable late-time de Sitter (dS) minimum maps to the dynamics\nof Dyson Brownian motion describing the relaxation of non-equilibrium\neigenvalue spectra in random matrix theory. We analytically compute the\nrelaxation probability in a saddle point approximation of the partition\nfunction of the eigenvalue distribution of the Wigner ensemble describing the\nmass matrices of the critical points. When applied to small-field inflation in\nthe landscape, this leads to an exponentially strong bias against small-field\nranges and an upper bound $N\\ll 10$ on the number of light fields $N$\nparticipating during inflation from the non-observation of negative spatial\ncurvature.\n", "  Electromagnetic wave extinction by the very long but finite dielectric needle\nis compared with that by the infinite dielectric cylinder for an oblique\nincidence of the electromagnetic wave. It is shown that the renormalized Hankel\nfunctions without the logarithmic terms should be used for the calculation of\nthe extinction per unit length of the infinite dielectric cylinder to apply it\nfor extinction calculations by the finite dielectric cylinder.\n", "  Searches are presented for direct production of top or bottom squark pairs in\nproton-proton collisions at the CERN LHC. Two searches, based on complementary\ntechniques, are performed in all-jet final states that are characterized by a\nsignificant imbalance in transverse momentum. An additional search requires the\npresence of a charged lepton isolated from other activity in the event. The\ndata were collected in 2015 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS\ndetector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns.\nNo statistically significant excess of events is found beyond the expected\ncontribution from standard model processes. Exclusion limits are set in the\ncontext of simplified models of top or bottom squark pair production. Models\nwith top and bottom squark masses up to 830 and 890 GeV, respectively, are\nprobed for light neutralinos. For models with top squark masses of 675 GeV,\nneutralino masses up to 260 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level.\n", "  Studying atmospheric neutrino oscillations in the few-GeV range with a\nmultimegaton detector promises to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy. This\nis the main science goal pursued by the future KM3NeT/ORCA water Cherenkov\ndetector in the Mediterranean Sea. In this paper, the processes that limit the\nobtainable resolution in both energy and direction in charged-current neutrino\nevents in the ORCA detector are investigated. These processes include the\ncomposition of the hadronic fragmentation products, the subsequent particle\npropagation and the photon-sampling fraction of the detector. GEANT simulations\nof neutrino interactions in seawater produced by GENIE are used to study the\neffects in the 1 - 20 GeV range. It is found that fluctuations in the hadronic\ncascade in conjunction with the variation of the inelasticity y are most\ndetrimental to the resolutions. The effect of limited photon sampling in the\ndetector is of significantly less importance. These results will therefore also\nbe applicable to similar detectors/media, such as those in ice.\n", "  New physics contributions to the $Z$ penguin are revisited in the light of\nthe recently-reported discrepancy of the direct CP violation in $K\\to\\pi\\pi$.\nInterference effects between the standard model and new physics contributions\nto $\\Delta S = 2$ observables are taken into account. Although the effects are\noverlooked in the literature, they make experimental bounds significantly\nseverer. It is shown that the new physics contributions must be tuned to\nenhance $\\mathcal{B}(K_L \\to \\pi^{0} \\nu \\bar{\\nu})$, if the discrepancy of the\ndirect CP violation is explained with satisfying the experimental constraints.\nThe branching ratio can be as large as $6 \\times 10^{-10}$ when the\ncontributions are tuned at the 10 % level.\n", "  We compute the entanglement entropy of a free massive Dirac field between two\ncausally disconnected open charts in de Sitter space. We first derive the\nBunch-Davies vacuum mode functions of the Dirac field. We find there exists no\nsupercurvature mode for the Dirac field. We then give the Bogoliubov\ntransformation between the Bunch-Davies vacuum and the open chart vacua that\nmakes the reduced density matrix diagonal. We find that the Dirac field becomes\nmore entangled than a scalar field as $m^2/H^2$ becomes small, and the\ndifference is maximal in the massless limit.\n", "  For certain families of finite quantum graphs, we study the question of how\neigenfunctions are distributed over the graph. To characterize properties of\nthe distribution, generalized entropies of the R\\'{e}nyi and Tsallis types are\nconsidered. The presented approach is similar to entropic uncertainty relations\nof the Maassen-Uffink type. Using the Riesz theorem, we derive lower bounds on\nsymmetrized generalized entropies of eigenfunctions. A quality of such\nestimates will depend on boundary conditions used at vertices of the given\ngraph. R\\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies of eigenfunctions of star graphs are\nseparately examined. Relations between generalized entropies and variances of\neigenfunctions are considered as well. When such relations remain valid on\naverage, they may be used in studies of quantum ergodicity.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the uniaxial propagation of transient waves within a\nsemi-infinite viscoelastic Bessel medium. First, we provide the analytic\nexpression for the response function of the material as we approach the\nwave-front. To do so, we take profit of a revisited version of the so called\nBuchen-Mainardi algorithm. Secondly, we provide an analytic expression for the\nlong time behavior of the response function of the material. This result is\nobtained by means of the Tauberian theorems for the Laplace transform. Finally,\nwe relate the obtained results to a peculiar model for fluid-filled elastic\ntubes.\n", "  Using the recently introduced time-local formulation of the nonequilibrium\ncluster perturbation theory (CPT), we construct a generalization of the\napproach such that macroscopic conservation laws are respected. This is\nachieved by exploiting the freedom for the choice of the starting point of the\nall-order perturbation theory in the inter-cluster hopping. The proposed\nconserving CPT is a self-consistent propagation scheme which respects the\nconservation of energy, particle number and spin, which treats short-range\ncorrelations exactly up to the linear scale of the cluster, and which\nrepresents a mean-field-like approach on length scales beyond the cluster size.\nUsing Green's functions, conservation laws are formulated as local continuity\nequations for the local spin-dependent particle and the doublon density. We\nconsider them as conditional equations to self-consistently fix the\ntime-dependent intra-cluster one-particle parameters. Thanks to the intrinsic\ncausality of the CPT, this can be set up as a step-by-step time propagation\nscheme with a computational effort scaling linearly with the maximum\npropagation time and exponentially in the cluster size. As a proof of concept,\nwe consider the dynamics of the two-dimensional, particle-hole-symmetric\nHubbard model following a weak interaction quench by simply employing two-site\nclusters only. Conservation laws are satisfied by construction. We demonstrate\nthat enforcing them has strong impact on the dynamics. While the doublon\ndensity is strongly oscillating within plain CPT, a monotonic relaxation is\nobserved within the conserving CPT.\n", "  We consider the diffusion of new products in the discrete Bass-SIR model, in\nwhich consumers who adopt the product can later \"recover\" and stop influencing\ntheir peers to adopt the product. To gain insight into the effect of the social\nnetwork structure on the diffusion, we focus on two extreme cases. In the\n\"most-connected\" configuration where all consumers are inter-connected\n(complete network), averaging over all consumers leads to an aggregate model,\nwhich combines the Bass model for diffusion of new products with the SIR model\nfor epidemics. In the \"least-connected\" configuration where consumers are\narranged on a circle and each consumer can only be influenced by his left\nneighbor (one-sided 1D network), averaging over all consumers leads to a\ndifferent aggregate model which is linear, and can be solved explicitly. We\nconjecture that for any other network, the diffusion is bounded from below and\nfrom above by that on a one-sided 1D network and on a complete network,\nrespectively. When consumers are arranged on a circle and each consumer can be\ninfluenced by his left and right neighbors (two-sided 1D network), the\ndiffusion is strictly faster than on a one-sided 1D network. This is different\nfrom the case of non-recovering adopters, where the diffusion on one-sided and\non two-sided 1D networks is identical. We also propose a nonlinear model for\nrecoveries, and show that consumers' heterogeneity has a negligible effect on\nthe aggregate diffusion.\n", "  We investigate gravitational radiation memory and its corresponding effect on\nthe asymptotic symmetries of a body whose exterior is a boosted Schwarzschild\nspacetime. First, in the context of linearized theory, we consider such a\nSchwarzschild body which is initially at rest, then goes through a radiative\nstage and finally emerges as a boosted Schwarzschild body. We show that the\nproper retarded solution of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime for this\nprocess can be described in terms of the ingoing Kerr-Schild form of the\nSchwarzschild metric for both the initial and final states. An outgoing\nKerr-Schild or time symmetric metric does not give the proper solution. The\nspecial property of Kerr-Schild metrics that their linearized and nonlinear\nforms are identical allows us to extend this result to processes in the\nnonlinear regime. We then discuss how the nonlinear memory effect, and its\nassociated supertranslation, affect angular momentum conservation. Our approach\nprovides a new framework for studying nonlinear aspects of the memory effect.\n", "  The rare baryonic decay $\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda(\\to p\\pi^-)\\mu^+\\mu^-$ provides\nvaluable complementary information compared to the corresponding mesonic $b\\to\ns\\mu^+\\mu^-$ transition. In this paper, using the latest high-precision lattice\nQCD calculation of the $\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda$ transition form factors, we study\nthis interesting decay within the aligned two-Higgs-doublet model, paying\nparticularly attention to effects of the chirality-flipped operators generated\nby the charged scalars. In order to extract the full set of angular\ncoefficients in this decay, we consider the following ten angular observables\nthat can be derived from the analysis of the subsequent parity-violating\n$\\Lambda\\to p\\pi^-$ decay: the differential branching fraction ${\\rm d}{\\cal\nB}/{\\rm d}q^2$, the longitudinal polarization fraction $F_L$, the lepton-,\nhadron- and combined lepton-hadron-side forward-backward asymmetries $A_{\\rm\nFB}^\\ell$, $A_{\\rm FB}^\\Lambda$ and $A_{\\rm FB}^{\\ell\\Lambda}$, as well as the\nother five asymmetry observables $Y_i$~($i={\\rm 2,\\,3s,\\,3sc,\\,4s,\\,4sc}$).\nDetailed numerical comparisons are made between the SM and NP values for these\nangular observables. It is found that, under the constraints from the inclusive\n$B\\to X_s\\gamma$ branching fraction and the latest global fit results of $b\\to\ns\\ell\\ell$ data, the contributions of right-handed semileptonic operators\n$O^{\\prime}_{9,10}$, besides reconciling the $P_5^{\\prime}$ anomaly observed in\n$B^0\\to K^{\\ast 0}\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay, could also enhance the values of ${\\rm\nd}{\\cal B}/{\\rm d}q^2$ and $A_{\\rm FB}^\\ell$ in the bin $[15,20]~{\\rm GeV}^2$,\nleading to results consistent with the current LHCb measurements.\n", "  Majorana bound states (MBS) are well-established in the clean limit in chains\nof ferromagnetically aligned impurities deposited on conventional\nsuperconductors with finite spin-orbit coupling. Here we show that these MBS\nare very robust against disorder. By performing self-consistent calculations we\nfind that the MBS are protected as long as the surrounding superconductor show\nno large signs of inhomogeneity. We find that longer chains offer more\nstability against disorder for the MBS, albeit the minigap decreases, as do\nincreasing strengths of spin-orbit coupling and superconductivity.\n", "  Observations of the continuum spectrum emitted by accretion disks around\nblack holes allows us to infer their properties, including possibly whether\nblack holes are described by the Kerr metric. Some modified gravity theories do\nnot admit the Kerr metric as a solution, and thus, continuum spectrum\nobservations could be used to constrain these theories. We here investigate\nwhether current and next generation X-Ray observations of the black hole\ncontinuum spectrum can constrain such deviations from Einstein's theory,\nfocusing on two well-motivated modified quadratic gravity theories: dynamical\nChern-Simons gravity and Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We do so by\ndetermining whether the non-Kerr deviations in the continuum spectrum\nintroduced by these theories are larger than the observational error intrinsic\nto the observations. We find that dynamical Chern-Simons gravity cannot be\nconstrained better than current bounds with current or next generation\ncontinuum spectrum observations. Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity,\nhowever, may be constrained better than current bounds with next generation\ntelescopes, as long as the systematic error inherent in the accretion disk\nmodeling is decreased below the predicted observational error.\n", "  In Hamiltonian systems characterized by a degenerate Poisson algebra, we show\nhow to construct a local energy-like quantity that can be used to study\ndiabatic effects on the evolution of the Available Energy of the system, the\nlatter concept formalizing the original idea of Margules'. We calculate the\nlocal diagnostic energy for geophysically relevant flows. For the particular\ncase of stratified Boussinesq flows, we show that under moderately general\nconditions, in inertial frames where the initial distribution of potential\nvorticity is even around the origin, our framework recovers the Available\nPotential Energy introduced by Holliday and McIntyre \\cite{HollidayM81}, and as\nsuch depends only on the mass distribution of the flow. In non-inertial frames,\nwe show that the local diagnostic energy of flows which are, in an appropriate\nsense, characterized by a low-Rossby number ${\\rm Ro}$ ground state, has to\nlowest order in ${\\rm Ro}$, a universal character.\n", "  A theoretical study of the current-driven dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in\ndisordered perpendicularly-magnetized ultrathin films is presented. The\ndisorder is simulated as a granular structure in which the local anisotropy\nvaries randomly from grain to grain. The skyrmion velocity is computed for\ndifferent disorder parameters and ensembles. Similar behavior is seen for\nspin-torques due to in-plane currents and the spin Hall effect, where a pinning\nregime can be identified at low currents with a transition towards the\ndisorder-free case at higher currents, similar to domain wall motion in\ndisordered films. Moreover, a current-dependent skyrmion Hall effect and\nfluctuations in the core radius are found, which result from the interaction\nwith the pinning potential.\n", "  The accurate prediction of singlet and triplet excitation energies is of\nsignificant fundamental interest and is critical for many applications. An area\nof intense research, most calculations of singlet and triplet energies use\ntime-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in conjunction with an\napproximate exchange-correlation functional. In this work, we examine and\ncritically assess an alternative method for predicting low-lying neutral\nexcitations with similar computational cost, the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter\nequation (BSE) approach, and compare results against high-accuracy\nwavefunction-based methods. We consider singlet and triplet excitations of 27\nprototypical organic molecules, including members of Thiel's set, the acene\nseries, and several aromatic hydrocarbons exhibiting charge-transfer-like\nexcitations. Analogous to its impact in TDDFT, we find that the Tamm-Dancoff\napproximation (TDA) overcomes triplet instabilities in the BSE approach,\nimproving both triplet and singlet energetics relatively to higher level\ntheories. Finally, we find that BSE-TDA calculations built on good DFT starting\npoints, such as those utilizing optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid\nfunctionals, can yield accurate singlet and triplet excitation energies for\ngas-phase organic molecules.\n", "  Two-particle rapidity (or pseudorapidity) correlation function $C(y_1, y_2)$\nwas used in analysing fluctuation of particle density distribution in rapidity\nin high-energy heavy-ion collisions. In our research, we argue that for a\ncentrality window, some additional correlation may be caused by a centrality\nspan, when the mean two- and single-particle densities over a centrality window\nare used directly in the calculation , just like $\\left<N(y_1, y_2) \\right> /\n\\left[\\left<N(y_1)\\right>\\left<N(y_2)\\right>\\right]$. We concentrate on\nremoving the influence of collision-centrality span on correlation function,\nand two calculation methods are raised. In one method, correlation coefficients\nare considered to be the ratios of probabilities (not the particle density). In\nthe other method, a relative multiplicity is introduced to unity the events of\ndifferent centralities. For testing the methods, {\\sc ampt} model is used and a\ntoy granular model is built to simulate the fluctuation of particle density in\nrapidity.\n", "  Edge diffraction of a circular optical vortex (OV) beam transforms its\nsingular structure: a multicharged axial OV splits into the set of\nsingle-charged ones that form the 'singular skeleton' of the diffracted beam.\nThe OV positions in the beam cross section depend on the propagation distance\nas well as on the edge position with respect to the incident beam axis, and the\nOV cores describe regular trajectories when one or both of these parameters\nchange. However, the trajectories are not always continuous; they may be\naccompanied with topological reactions, including emergence of new\nsingularities, their interaction and annihilation. Based on the\nKirchhoff-Fresnel integral, we consider the singular skeleton behavior in\ndiffracted Kummer beams and Laguerre-Gaussian beams with topological charge\n|m|=2 and 3. We reveal the nature of the trajectories' discontinuities and\nother topological events in the singular skeleton evolution that appear to be\nhighly sensitive to the incident beam properties and to the diffraction\nconditions. Conditions at which the OV trajectory becomes discontinuous and\nmechanisms by which this is realized are discussed. The conclusions based on\nthe numerical calculations are supported by the asymptotic analytical model of\nthe OV beam diffraction. The results can be useful in the OV metrology and for\nthe OV beam's diagnostics.\n", "  We constrain the neutrino mass in the scenario of vacuum energy interacting\nwith cold dark matter by using current cosmological observations. To avoid the\nlarge-scale instability problem in interacting dark energy models, we employ\nthe parameterized post-Friedmann (PPF) approach to do the calculation of\nperturbation evolution, for the $Q=\\beta H\\rho_{\\rm c}$ and $Q=\\beta\nH\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ models. The current observational data sets used in this work\ninclude Planck (cosmic microwave background), BSH (baryon acoustic\noscillations, type Ia supernovae, and Hubble constant), and LSS (redshift space\ndistortions and weak lensing). According to the constraint results, we find\nthat $\\beta>0$ at more than $1\\sigma$ level for the $Q=\\beta H\\rho_{\\rm c}$\nmodel, which indicates that cold dark matter decays into vacuum energy; while\n$\\beta=0$ is consistent with the current data at $1\\sigma$ level for the\n$Q=\\beta H\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ model. Taking the $\\Lambda$CDM model as a baseline\nmodel, we find that a smaller upper limit, $\\sum m_{\\nu}<0.11$ eV ($2\\sigma$),\nis induced by the latest BAO BOSS DR12 data and the Hubble constant measurement\n$H_{0} = 73.00 \\pm 1.75$ km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. For the $Q=\\beta H\\rho_{\\rm\nc}$ model, we obtain $\\sum m_{\\nu}<0.20$ eV ($2\\sigma$) from Planck+BSH. For\nthe $Q=\\beta H\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ model, $\\sum m_{\\nu}<0.10$ eV ($2\\sigma$) and\n$\\sum m_{\\nu}<0.14$ eV ($2\\sigma$) are derived from Planck+BSH and\nPlanck+BSH+LSS, respectively. We show that these smaller upper limits on $\\sum\nm_{\\nu}$ are affected more or less by the tension between $H_{0}$ and other\nobservational data.\n", "  Graphene is a mechanically robust 2D material promising for flexible\noptoelectronic applications. However, its electromagnetic properties under\nstrain are experimentally poorly understood. Here we present the far-infrared\ntransmission spectra of large-area chemical-vapor deposited monolayer graphene\non a polyethylene terephthalate substrate subjected to uniaxial strain. The\neffective strain value is calibrated using the Raman spectroscopy and corrected\nfor a relaxation of wrinkles and folds seen directly by atomic-force\nmicroscopy. We find that while the Drude weight and the Fermi level remain\nconstant, the scattering rate increases by more than 10% per 1% of applied\nstrain, showing a high level of reproducibility during strain cycling. As a\nresult, the electronic mobility and optical absorption of graphene at terahertz\nand lower frequencies appear to also be sensitive to strain, which opens\npathways to control these key parameters mechanically. We suggest that such a\nfunctionality can be potentially used in flexible optoelectronic and\nmicroelectromechanical systems based on graphene. By combining our findings\nwith existing theoretical models, we discuss the possible mechanisms of\nstrain-controlled Drude scattering.\n", "  Theories with extended Higgs sectors constructed in view of cosmological\nramifications (gravitational wave signal, baryogenesis, dark matter) are often\nfaced with conflicting requirements for their couplings; in particular those\ninfluencing the strength of a phase transition may be large. Large couplings\ncompromise perturbative studies, as well as the high-temperature expansion that\nis invoked in dimensionally reduced lattice investigations. With the example of\nthe inert doublet extension of the Standard Model (IDM), we show how a resummed\n2-loop effective potential can be computed without a high-T expansion, and use\nthe result to scrutinize its accuracy. With the exception of Tc, which is\nsensitive to contributions from heavy modes, the high-T expansion is found to\nperform well. 2-loop corrections weaken the transition in IDM, but they are\nmoderate, whereby a strong transition remains an option.\n", "  In a general decay chain $A\\to B_1B_2\\to C_1C_2\\ldots$, we prove that the\nangular correlation function $I(\\theta_1,\\theta_2,\\phi_+)$ in the decay of\n$B_{1,2}$ is irrelevant to the polarization of the mother particle $A$ at\nproduction. This guarantees that we can use these angular distributions to\ndetermine the spin-parity nature of $A$ without knowing its production details.\nAs an example, we investigate the decay of a potential doubly-charged boson\n$H^{\\pm\\pm}$ going to same-sign $\\tau$ lepton pair.\n", "  Using the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formalism, we prove a recursive expansion of\ntree level single trace Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) amplitudes with arbitrary\nnumber of gluons and gravitons, which is valid for general spacetime dimensions\nand any helicity configurations. The recursion is written in terms of\nfewer-graviton EYM amplitudes and pure Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes, which can be\nfurther carried out until we reach an expansion in terms of pure YM amplitudes\nin Kleiss-Kuijf (KK) basis. Our expansion then generates naturally a spanning\ntree structure rooted on gluons whose vertices are gravitons. We further\npropose a set of graph theoretical rules based on spanning trees that evaluate\ndirectly the pure YM expansion coefficients.\n", "  The derivation of approximate wave functions for an electron submitted to\nboth a coulomb and a time-dependent laser electric fields, the so-called\nCoulomb-Volkov (CV) state, is addressed. Despite its derivation for continuum\nstates does not exhibit any particular problem within the framework of the\nstandard theory of quantum mechanics (QM), difficulties arise when considering\nan initially bound atomic state. Indeed the natural way of translating the\nunperturbed momentum by the laser vector potential is no longer possible since\na bound state does not exhibit a plane wave form including explicitely a\nmomentum. The use of a fractal space permits to naturally define a momentum for\na bound wave function. Within this framework, it is shown how the derivation of\nlaser-dressed bound states can be performed. Based on a generalized eikonal\napproach, a new expression for the laser-dressed states is also derived, fully\nsymmetric relative to the continuum or bound nature of the initial unperturbed\nwave function. It includes an additional crossed term in the Volkov phase which\nwas not obtained within the standard theory of quantum mechanics. The\nderivations within this fractal framework have highlighted other possible ways\nto derive approximate laser-dressed states in QM. After comparing the various\nobtained wave functions, an application to the prediction of the ionization\nprobability of hydrogen targets by attosecond XUV pulses within the sudden\napproximation is provided. This approach allows to make predictions in various\nregimes depending on the laser intensity, going from the non-resonant\nmultiphoton absorption to tunneling and barrier-suppression ionization.\n", "  Parameter estimation on gravitational wave signals from compact binary\ncoalescence (CBC) requires the evaluation of computationally intensive waveform\nmodels, typically the bottleneck in the analysis. This cost will increase\nfurther as low frequency sensitivity in later second and third generation\ndetectors motivates the use of longer waveforms.\n  We describe a method for accelerating parameter estimation by exploiting the\nchirping behaviour of the signals to sample the waveform sparsely for portions\nwhere the full frequency resolution is not required. We demonstrate that the\nmethod can reproduce the original results with a waveform mismatch of $\\leq\n5\\times 10^{-7}$, but with a waveform generation cost up to $\\sim 50$ times\nlower for computationally costly frequency-domain waveforms starting from below\n8 Hz.\n", "  We list all potential candidates for U(1) anomalous non-local 1-loop 4-point\namplitudes and higher loop UV divergences in $\\mathcal{N}\\geq 5$\nsupergravities. The relevant chiral superinvariants are constructed from\nlinearized chiral superfields and define the corresponding superamplitudes. The\nanomalous amplitudes, of the kind present in $\\mathcal{N}=4$, are shown to be\nabsent in $\\mathcal{N} \\geq 5$. In $\\mathcal{N}=6$ supergravity the result is\ndeduced from the double-copy $\\mathcal{N}=4_{YM} \\times (\\mathcal{N}=2)_{YM}$\nmodel, whereas in $\\mathcal{N}=5,8$ the result on absence of anomalous\namplitudes is derived in supergravities as well as in the $(\\mathcal{N}=4)_{YM}\n\\times (\\mathcal{N}-4)_{YM}$ double-copy models.\n", "  The paper focuses on considering some special precessional motions as the\nspin motions, separating the octonion angular momentum of a proton into six\ncomponents, elucidating the proton angular momentum in the proton spin puzzle,\nespecially the proton spin, decomposition, quarks and gluons, and polarization\nand so forth. J. C. Maxwell was the first to use the quaternions to study the\nelectromagnetic fields. Subsequently the complex octonions are utilized to\ndepict the electromagnetic field, gravitational field, and quantum mechanics\nand so forth. In the complex octonion space, the precessional equilibrium\nequation infers the angular velocity of precession. The external\nelectromagnetic strength may induce a new precessional motion, generating a new\nterm of angular momentum, even if the orbital angular momentum is zero. This\nnew term of angular momentum can be regarded as the spin angular momentum, and\nits angular velocity of precession is different from the angular velocity of\nrevolution. The study reveals that the angular momentum of the proton must be\nseparated into more components than ever before. In the proton spin puzzle, the\norbital angular momentum and magnetic dipole moment are independent of each\nother, and they should be measured and calculated respectively.\n", "  This review paper summarizes the current state-of-art and challenges for the\nfuture developments of fiber-reinforced composites for structural applications\nwith multifunctional capabilities. After a brief analysis of the reasons of the\nsuccessful incorporation of fiber-reinforced composites in many different\nindustrial sectors, the review analyzes three critical factors that will define\nthe future of composites. The first one is the application of novel\nfiber-deposition and preforming techniques together with innovative liquid\nmoulding strategies, which will be combined by optimization tools based on\nnovel multiscale modelling approaches, so fiber-reinforced composites with\noptimized properties can be designed and manufactured for each application. In\naddition, composite applications will be enhanced by the incorporation of\nmultifunctional capabilities. Among them, electrical conductivity, energy\nstorage (structural supercapacitors and batteries) and energy harvesting\n(piezoelectric and solar energy) seem to be the most promising ones.\n", "  We study the anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization in chiral\nantiferromagnets, constructing a simple tight-binding model on a stacked Kagome\nlattice structure with spin-orbit coupling and the exchange interaction between\nthe localized spins and itinerant electrons. It is shown that the ground state\nis an orbital ferromagnet with the easy-plane anisotropy. The relation between\nthe orbital magnetization and the configuration of the Weyl points are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The paper aims to apply the complex-sedenions to explore the wavefunctions\nand field equations of non-Abelian gauge fields, considering the spatial\ndimensions of a unit vector as the color degrees of freedom in the\ncomplex-quaternion wavefunctions, exploring the physical properties of the\ncolor confinement essentially. J. C. Maxwell was the first to employ the\nquaternions to study the physical properties of electromagnetic fields. His\nmethod inspires some subsequent scholars to introduce the quaternions,\noctonions, and sedenions to research the electromagnetic field, gravitational\nfield, nuclear field, quantum mechanics, and gauge field. The application of\ncomplex-sedenions is capable of depicting not only the field equations of the\nclassical mechanics on the macroscopic scale, but also the field equations of\nthe quantum mechanics on the microscopic scale. The latter can be degenerated\ninto the Dirac equation and Yang-Mills equation. In contrast to the\ncomplex-number wavefunction, the wavefunction in the complex-quaternion space\npossesses three new degrees of freedom, that is, three color degrees of\nfreedom. One complex-quaternion wavefunction is equivalent to three\nconventional wavefunctions with the complex-numbers. It means that the three\nspatial dimensions of unit vector in the complex-quaternion wavefunction can be\nconsidered as the `three colors', naturally the color confinement will be\neffective. In other words, in the complex-quaternion space, the `three colors'\nare only the spatial dimensions, rather than any property of physical\nsubstance. The existing `three colors' can be merged into the wavefunction,\ndescribed with the complex-quaternions.\n", "  Based on known analytic results, the thermal expectation value of the\nstress-energy tensor (SET) operator for the massless Dirac field is analyzed\nfrom a hydrodynamic perspective. Key to this analysis is the Landau\ndecomposition of the SET, with the aid of which we find terms which are not\npresent in the ideal SET predicted by kinetic theory. Moreover, the quantum\ncorrections become dominant in the vicinity of the speed of light surface\n(SOL). While rigidly-rotating thermal states cannot be constructed for the\nKlein-Gordon field, we perform a similar analysis at the level of quantum\ncorrections previously reported in the literature and we show that the Landau\nframe is well-defined only when the system is enclosed inside a boundary\nlocated inside or on the SOL. We discuss the relevance of these results for\naccretion disks around rapidly-rotating pulsars.\n", "  Extending the work of Ferrara and one of the authors, we present dynamical\ncosmological models of $\\alpha$-attractors with plateau potentials for\n$3\\alpha=1,2,3,4,5,6,7$. These models are motivated by geometric properties of\nmaximally supersymmetric theories: M-theory, superstring theory, and maximal $N\n= 8$ supergravity. After a consistent truncation of maximal to minimal\nsupersymmetry in a seven-disk geometry, we perform a two-step procedure: 1) we\nintroduce a superpotential, which stabilizes the moduli of the seven-disk\ngeometry in a supersymmetric minimum, 2) we add a cosmological sector with a\nnilpotent stabilizer, which breaks supersymmetry spontaneously and leads to a\ndesirable class of cosmological attractor models. These models with $n_s$\nconsistent with observational data, and with tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \\approx\n10^{-2}- 10^{-3}$, provide natural targets for future B-mode searches. We\nrelate the issue of stability of inflationary trajectories in these models to\ntessellations of a hyperbolic geometry.\n", "  Eruptive phenomena such as plasmoid ejections or jets are an important\nfeature of solar activity with the potential for improving our understanding of\nthe dynamics of the solar atmosphere. Such ejections are often thought to be\nsignatures of the outflows expected in regions of fast magnetic reconnection.\nThe 304 A EUV line of Helium, formed at around 10^5 K, is found to be a\nreliable tracer of such phenomena, but the determination of physical parameters\nfrom such observations is not straightforward. We have observed a plasmoid\nejection from an X-ray bright point simultaneously at millimeter wavelengths\nwith ALMA, at EUV wavelengths with AIA, in soft X-rays with Hinode/XRT. This\npaper reports the physical parameters of the plasmoid obtained by combining the\nradio, EUV and X-ray data. As a result, we conclude that the plasmoid can\nconsist either of (approximately) isothermal 10^5 K plasma that is optically\nthin at 100 GHz, or else a 10^4 K core with a hot envelope. The analysis\ndemonstrates the value of the additional temperature and density constraints\nthat ALMA provides, and future science observations with ALMA will be able to\nmatch the spatial resolution of space-borne and other high-resolution\ntelescopes.\n", "  We evaluate entropy production in a photovoltaic cell that is modeled by four\nelectronic levels resonantly coupled to thermally populated field modes at\ndifferent temperatures. We use a formalism recently proposed, the so-called\nmultiple parallel worlds, to consistently address the nonlinearity of entropy\nin terms of density matrix. Our result shows that entropy production is the\ndifference between two flows: a semiclassical flow that linearly depends on\noccupational probabilities, and another flow that depends nonlinearly on\nquantum coherence and has no semiclassical analog. We show that entropy\nproduction in the cells depends on environmentally induced decoherence time and\nenergy detuning. We characterize regimes where reversal flow of information\ntakes place from a cold to hot bath. Interestingly, we identify a lower bound\non entropy production, which sets limitations on the statistics of dissipated\nheat in the cells.\n", "  Tungstates $A$WO$_4$ with the wolframite structure characterized by the\n$A$O$_6$ octahedral zigzag chains along the $c$-axis, can be magnetic if\n$A$=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Ni. Among them, MnWO$_4$ is a unique member with a cycloid\nMn$^{2+}$ spin order developed at low temperature, leading to an interesting\ntype-II multiferroic behavior. However, so far no other multiferroic material\nin the tungstate family has been found. In this work, we present the synthesis\nand the systematic study of the double tungstate LiFe(WO$_4$)$_2$. Experimental\ncharacterizations including structural, thermodynamic, magnetic, neutron powder\ndiffraction, and pyroelectric measurements, unambiguously confirm that\nLiFe(WO$_4$)$_2$ is the secondly found multiferroic system in the tungstate\nfamily. The cycloidal magnetism driven ferroelectricity is also verified by\ndensity functional theory calculations. Although here the magnetic couplings\nbetween Fe ions are indirect, namely via the so-called super-super-exchanges,\nthe temperatures of magnetic and ferroelectric transitions are surprisingly\nmuch higher than those of MnWO$_4$.\n", "  We present an ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study of\nstructural defects in molybdenum disulfide thin films grown on silicon\nsubstrates by chemical vapor deposition. A distinctive type of grain boundary\nperiodically arranged inside an isolated triangular domain, along with other\ninter-domain grain boundaries of various types, is observed. These periodic\ndefects, about 50 nm apart and a few nanometers in width, remain hidden in\noptical or low-resolution microscopy studies. We report a complex growth\nmechanism that produces 2D nucleation and spiral growth features that can\nexplain the topography in our films.\n", "  Online petitions are an important avenue for direct political action, yet the\ndynamics that determine when a petition will be successful are not well\nunderstood. Here we analyze the temporal characteristics of online-petition\nsigning behavior in order to identify systematic differences between popular\npetitions, which receive a high volume of signatures, and unpopular ones. We\nfind that, in line with other temporal characterizations of human activity, the\nsigning process is typically non-Poissonian and non-homogeneous in time.\nHowever, this process exhibits anomalously high memory for human activity,\npossibly indicating that synchronized external influence or contagion play and\nimportant role. More interestingly, we find clear differences in the\ncharacteristics of the inter-event time distributions depending on the total\nnumber of signatures that petitions receive, independently of the total\nduration of the petitions. Specifically, popular petitions that attract a large\nvolume of signatures exhibit more variance in the distribution of inter-event\ntimes than unpopular petitions with only a few signatures, which could be\nconsidered an indication that the former are more bursty. However, petitions\nwith large signature volume are less bursty according to measures that consider\nthe time ordering of inter-event times. Our results, therefore, emphasize the\nimportance of accounting for time ordering to characterize human activity.\n", "  We present a large-scale mapping toward the GEM OB1 association in the\ngalactic anti-center direction. The 9^deg * 6.5^deg area was mapped in 12CO,\n13CO, and C18O with 50\" angular resolution at 30\" sampling. The region was\ndivided into four main components based on spatial distribution and velocity:\nthe Gemini OB1 Giant Molecular Cloud (GGMC) Complex, the Lynds Dark Clouds and\nthe West Front Clouds, the Swallow and Horn, and the Remote Clouds. The GGMC\nComplex is located in the Perseus arm, while the Lynds Dark Clouds and the West\nFront Clouds are located in the Local arm. Swallow and Horn are revealed for\nthe first time in this paper. The two clouds have a similar velocity interval\n([11, 21] km s^-1) and have similar sizes (0.6 and 0.8 deg^2). We analyzed the\nstructure of these clouds in detail and calculated their parameters (mass,\ntemperature, etc.). Two elongated structures were discovered in a\nlongitude-velocity map in the velocity interval [11, 30] km s^-1. We also found\nan interesting filament that shows a 0.8 km s^-1 pc^-1 gradient perpendicular\nto the direction of the long axis.\n", "  This note reviews recent theoretical developments in the study of charged\nlepton flavour violation. The first part illustrates the status of precise\nnext-to-leading order quantum electrodynamics calculations for the background\nof charged lepton flavour-violating processes, with a focus on the muonic\n\"rare\" and \"radiative\" decays. Phenomenological implications of these\ncomputations and their impact on present and future experiments will be\ndiscussed. The second part describes the recent progress in the effective field\ntheory interpretation of charged lepton-flavour violating observables in\nconnection with different energy scales. A systematic approach is briefly\npresented and applications on muonic and tauonic observables are reported. This\nnote is submitted as part of the conference proceedings for \"NuPhys2016:\nProspects in Neutrino Physics\".\n", "  Conjectural results for cohomological invariants of wild character varieties\nare obtained by counting curves in degenerate Calabi-Yau threefolds. A\nconjectural formula for E-polynomials is derived from the Gromov-Witten theory\nof local Calabi-Yau threefolds with normal crossing singularities. A refinement\nis also conjectured, generalizing existing results of Hausel, Mereb and Wong as\nwell as recent joint work of Donagi, Pantev and the author for weighted\nPoincar\\'e polynomials of wild character varieties.\n", "  The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab will search for the charged lepton flavor\nviolating process of neutrino-less $\\mu \\to e$ coherent conversion in the field\nof an aluminum nucleus. About $7 \\cdot 10^{17}$ muons, provided by a dedicated\nmuon beam line in construction at Fermilab, will be stopped in 3 years in the\naluminum target. The corresponding single event sensitivity will be $2.5\\cdot\n10^{-17}$. In this paper a brief overview of the physics explored by the $\\mu\n\\to e$ conversion is given, followed by a description of the Mu2e experimental\napparatus and the expected detector performance.\n", "  InGaAs-based Gate-all-Around (GAA) FETs with moderate to high In content are\nshown experimentally and theoretically to be unsuitable for low-leakage\nadvanced CMOS nodes. The primary cause for this is the large leakage penalty\ninduced by the Parasitic Bipolar Effect (PBE), which is seen to be particularly\ndifficult to remedy in GAA architectures. Experimental evidence of PBE in\nIn70Ga30As GAA FETs is demonstrated, along with a simulation-based analysis of\nthe PBE behavior. The impact of PBE is investigated by simulation for\nalternative device architectures, such as bulk FinFETs and\nFinFETs-on-insulator. PBE is found to be non-negligible in all standard InGaAs\nFET designs. Practical PBE metrics are introduced and the design of a substrate\narchitecture for PBE suppression is elucidated. Finally, it is concluded that\nthe GAA architecture is not suitable for low-leakage InGaAs FETs; a bulk FinFET\nis better suited for the role.\n", "  The phosphorous activation in Ge n$^{+}$/p junctions is compared in terms of\njunction depth, by using laser spike annealing at 860{\\deg}C for 400$\\mu$s. The\nreverse junction leakage is found to strongly depend on the abruptness of\ndopant profiles. A shallow and abrupt junction is shown to have lower\nphosphorous activation level, due to surface dose loss, and higher band-to-band\ntunneling (BTBT) leakage, when compared to the deep junction. Simulations were\ncarried out to evaluate the lowest achievable OFF-state currents (I$_{OFF}$)\nfor Ge double-gate FETs when using such an abrupt junction. Our results\nindicate that a Ge body thickness smaller than 5 nm is required to suppress the\nBTBT leakage and meet the requirement for the high performance devices defined\nby the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (I$_{OFF}$ =\n10$^{-7}$ A/$\\mu$m).\n", "  Boron-doped diamond undergoes an insulator-metal transition at some critical\nvalue (around 2.21 at %) of the dopand concentration. Here, we report a simple\nmethod for the calculation of its bulk modulus, based on the thermodynamical\nmodel, by Varotsos and Alexopoulos, that has been originally suggested for the\ninterconnection between the defect formation parameters in solids and bulk\nproperties. The results obtained at the doping level of 2.6 at %, which was\nlater improved at the level 0.5 at %, are in agreement with the experimental\nvalues.\n", "  We propose a new approximate series solution of the semiclassical Wigner\nequation by uniformization of WKB approximations of the Schr\\\"odinger\neigenfunctions.\n", "  This paper is in response to a recent comment by Bellissard\n[arXiv:1704.02644] on the paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 130201 (2017)]. It is\nexplained that the issues raised in the comment have already been discussed in\nthe paper and do not affect the conclusions of the paper.\n", "  An imperative aspect of modern science is that scientific institutions act\nfor the benefit of a common scientific enterprise, rather than for the personal\ngain of individuals within them. This implies that science should not\nperpetuate existing or historical unequal social orders. Some scientific\nterminology, though, gives a very different impression. I will give two\nexamples of terminology invented recently for the field of quantum information\nwhich use language associated with subordination, slavery, and racial\nsegregation: 'ancilla qubit' and 'quantum supremacy'.\n", "  Several auroral events that occurred in the past have not been catalogued as\nsuch due to fact that they were described in the historical sources with\ndifferent terminology. Hayakawa et al. (2016) have reviewed historical oriental\nchronicles and have proposed the terms \"unusual rainbow\" and \"white rainbow\" as\ncandidates to auroras. In this work, we present three events that took place in\nthe 18th century in two different settings (the Iberian Peninsula and Brazil)\nthat were originally described with similar definition/wording used by the\noriental chronicles, despite the inherent differences in terms associated to\noriental and Latin languages. We show that these terms are indeed applicable to\nthe three case studies from Europe and South America. Thus, the auroral\ncatalogues available can be extended for occidental sources with this new\nterminology.\n", "  In this study we have compared coronal loops in the Extreme ultraviolet\nImaging Telescope (EIT) on-board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)\nwith coronal loops from the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE). The\npurpose of which is to quantitatively and qualitatively examine the effects of\nspatial resolution on the width of coronal loops and implications for how a\ncoronal loop is defined. Out of twenty-two loop sections analyzed, we find that\nnone of them were resolved in EIT and none of them were close to the width of\nthe TRACE loops. These findings suggest that coronal loops are unresolved in\nEIT. We also find examples of how unresolved loops can be quite misleading. We\nhave also found that many of the TRACE loops that we have analyzed may be\nunresolved as well. Our findings emphasize the importance of studying loop\nwidth in order to better understand coronal loops and also emphasize the need\nfor instruments with higher spatial resolution.\n", "  We present the results of {\\it Chandra} observations of two non-accreting\nmillisecond pulsars, PSRs J1640$+$2224 (J1640) and J1709$+$2313 (J1709), with\nlow inferred magnetic fields and spin-down rates in order to constrain their\nsurface temperatures, obtain limits on the amplitude of unstable $r$-modes in\nthem, and make comparisons with similar limits obtained for a sample of\naccreting low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) neutron stars. We detect both pulsars in\nthe X-ray band for the first time. They are faint, with inferred soft X-ray\nfluxes ($0.3-3$ keV) of $\\approx$ $6\\times10^{-15}$ and $3\\times 10^{-15}$ erg\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for J1640 and J1709, respectively. Spectral analysis\nassuming hydrogen atmosphere emission gives global effective temperature upper\nlimits ($90\\%$ confidence) of $3.3 - 4.3 \\times 10^5$ K for J1640 and $3.6 -\n4.7 \\times 10^5$ K for J1709, where the low end of the range corresponds to\ncanonical neutron stars ($M=1.4 M_{\\odot}$), and the upper end corresponds to\nhigher-mass stars ($M=2.21 M_{\\odot}$). Under the assumption that $r$-mode\nheating provides the thermal support, we obtain dimensionless $r$-mode\namplitude upper limits of $3.2 - 4.8 \\times 10^{-8}$ and $1.8 - 2.8 \\times\n10^{-7}$ for J1640 and J1709, respectively, where again the low end of the\nrange corresponds to lower-mass, canonical neutron stars ($M=1.4 M_{\\odot}$).\nThese limits are about an order of magnitude lower than those we derived\npreviously for a sample of LMXBs, except for the accreting millisecond X-ray\npulsar (AMXP) SAX J1808.4$-$3658, which has a comparable amplitude limit to\nJ1640 and J1709.\n", "  This paper presents machine learning experiments performed over results of\ngalaxy classification into elliptical (E) and spiral (S) with morphological\nparameters: concetration (CN), assimetry metrics (A3), smoothness metrics (S3),\nentropy (H) and gradient pattern analysis parameter (GA). Except concentration,\nall parameters performed a image segmentation pre-processing. For supervision\nand to compute confusion matrices, we used as true label the galaxy\nclassification from GalaxyZoo. With a 48145 objects dataset after preprocessing\n(44760 galaxies labeled as S and 3385 as E), we performed experiments with\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT). Whit a 1962 objects\nbalanced dataset, we applied K- means and Agglomerative Hierarchical\nClustering. All experiments with supervision reached an Overall Accuracy OA >=\n97%.\n", "  Adding sufficient tensile strain to Ge can turn the material to a direct\nbandgap group IV semiconductor emitting in the mid-infrared wavelength range.\nHowever, highly strained-Ge cannot be directly grown on Si due to its large\nlattice mismatch. In this work, we have developed a process based on Ge\nmicro-bridge strain redistribution intentionally landed to the Si substrate.\nTraction arms can be then partially etched to keep only localized strained-Ge\nmicro-blocks. Large tunable uniaxial stresses up to 4.2% strain were\ndemonstrated bonded on Si. Our approach allows to envision integrated\nstrained-Ge on Si platform for mid-infrared integrated optics.\n", "  The $n$-fold Darboux transformation $T_{n}$ of the focusing real mo\\-di\\-fied\nKor\\-te\\-weg-de Vries (mKdV) equation is expressed in terms of the determinant\nrepresentation. Using this representation, the $n$-soliton solutions of the\nmKdV equation are also expressed by determinants whose elements consist of the\neigenvalues $\\lambda_{j}$ and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the\nassociated Lax equation. The nonsingular $n$-positon solutions of the focusing\nmKdV equation are obtained in the special limit\n$\\lambda_{j}\\rightarrow\\lambda_{1}$, from the corresponding $n$-soliton\nsolutions and by using the associated higher-order Taylor expansion.\nFurthermore, the decomposition method of the $n$-positon solution into $n$\nsingle-soliton solutions, the trajectories, and the corresponding \"phase\nshifts\" of the multi-positons are also investigated.\n", "  We present here $Spitzer$ mid-infrared (IR) spectra and modeling of the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of a selection of post-Asymptotic Giant\nBranch (PAGB) stars. The mid-IR spectra of majority of these sources showed\nspectral features such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and silicates\nin emission. Our results from SED modeling showed interesting trends of\ndependency between the photospheric and circumstellar parameters. A trend of\ndependency is also noticed between the ratios of equivalent widths (EWs) of\nvarious vibrational modes of PAHs and the photospheric temperature T$_{*}$ and\nmodel-derived stellar parameters for the sample stars. The PAGB mass loss rates\nderived from the SED models are found to be higher than those for the AGB\nstars. In a few objects, low and high excitation fine structure emission lines\nwere identified, indicating their advanced stage of evolution. Further, IR\nvibration modes of fullerene (C$_{60}$) were detected for the first time in the\nPAGB star IRAS 21546+4721.\n", "  Exhaled air contains aerosol of submicron droplets of the alveolar lining\nfluid (ALF), which are generated in the small airways of a human lung. Since\nthe exhaled particles are micro-samples of the ALF, their trapping opens up an\nopportunity to collect non-invasively a native material from respiratory tract.\nRecent studies of the particle characteristics (such as size distribution,\nconcentration and composition) in healthy and diseased subjects performed under\nvarious conditions have demonstrated a high potential of the analysis of\nexhaled aerosol droplets for identifying and monitoring pathological processes\nin the ALF. In this paper we present a new method for sampling of aerosol\nparticles during the exhaled breath barbotage (EBB) through liquid. The\nbarbotage procedure results in accumulation of the pulmonary surfactant, being\nthe main component of ALF, on the liquid surface, which makes possible the\nstudy its surface properties. We also propose a data processing algorithm to\nevaluate the surface pressure ($\\pi$) -- surface concentration ($\\Gamma$)\nisotherm from the raw data measured in a Langmuir trough. Finally, we analyze\nthe $(\\pi-\\Gamma)$ isotherms obtained for the samples collected in the groups\nof healthy volunteers and patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and compare them\nwith the isotherm measured for the artificial pulmonary surfactant.\n", "  Barrium fluoride (BaF2) thin films were prepared by electron beam evaporation\ntechnique at room temperature, on glass, Silicon and Aluminum substrates having\nthickness of 20 nm each. Its structural property and surface morphology were\nstudied using glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) and atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM) respectively. It was found that grain size, average surface\nroughness and interface width changes with different substrates. Higuchi\nalgorithm is applied for the fractal measure on AFM images.It was observed\nfound that the fractal dimension varied from substrate to substrate.\n", "  This thesis presents original results in two domains of disordered\nstatistical physics: logarithmic correlated Random Energy Models (logREMs), and\nlocalization transitions in long-range random matrices.\n  In the first part devoted to logREMs, we show how to characterise their\ncommon properties and model--specific data. Then we develop their replica\nsymmetry breaking treatment, which leads to the freezing scenario of their free\nenergy distribution and the general description of their minima process, in\nterms of decorated Poisson point process. We also report a series of new\napplications of the Jack polynomials in the exact predictions of some\nobservables in the circular model and its variants. Finally, we present the\nrecent progress on the exact connection between logREMs and the Liouville\nconformal field theory.\n  The goal of the second part is to introduce and study a new class of banded\nrandom matrices, the broadly distributed class, which is characterid an\neffective sparseness. We will first study a specific model of the class, the\nBeta Banded random matrices, inspired by an exact mapping to a recently studied\nstatistical model of long--range first--passage percolation/epidemics dynamics.\nUsing analytical arguments based on the mapping and numerics, we show the\nexistence of localization transitions with mobility edges in the\n\"stretch--exponential\" parameter--regime of the statistical models. Then, using\na block--diagonalization renormalization approach, we argue that such\nlocalization transitions occur generically in the broadly distributed class.\n", "  The decay of the Higgs boson to b quarks should be the dominant decay mode,\nbut it has not yet been conclusively established. The LHC run 1 results are\nrecalled and the current status of the LHC Run 2 studies is reviewed. The\nanalysis is approaching decisive sensitivity.\n", "  A new release of the Monte Carlo event generator Herwig (version 7.1) is now\navailable. This version introduces a number of improvements, notably: multi-jet\nmerging with the dipole shower at LO and NLO QCD; a new model for soft\ninteractions and diffraction; improvements to mass effects and top decays in\nthe dipole shower, as well as a new tune of the hadronisation parameters.\n", "  We present an in-depth study of two superflares (F1 and F2) detected on an\nactive binary star CC Eridani by the Swift observatory. These superflares\ntriggered the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) in the hard X-ray band on 2008\nOctober 16 and 2012 February 24. The rise phases of both the flares were\nobserved only with BAT, whereas the decay phases were observed simultaneously\nwith the X-ray Telescope. It has been found that the flares decay faster in the\nhard X-ray band than in the soft X-ray band. Both flares F1 and F2 are highly\nenergetic with respective peak X-ray luminosities of $\\sim$$10^{32.2}$ and\n$\\sim$$10^{31.8}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in 0.3--50 keV energy band, which are larger\nthan any other flares previously observed on CC Eri. The time-resolved spectral\nanalysis during the flares shows the variation in the coronal temperature,\nemission measure, and abundances. The elemental abundances are enhanced by a\nfactor of $\\sim$8 to the minimum observed in the post-flare phase for the flare\nF1. The observed peak temperatures in these two flares are found to be 174 MK\nand 128 MK. Using the hydrodynamic loop modeling, we derive loop lengths for\nboth the flares as 1.2$\\pm$0.1$\\times$10$^{10}$ cm and\n2.2$\\pm$0.6$\\times$10$^{10}$ cm, respectively. The Fe K$\\alpha$ emission at 6.4\nkeV is also detected in the X-ray spectra and we model the K$\\alpha$ emission\nfeature as fluorescence from the hot flare source irradiating the photospheric\niron. These superflares are the brightest, hottest, and shortest in duration\nobserved thus far on CC Eri.\n", "  In today's modeling and analysis of electrochemical cycling of Li- and Na-ion\nbatteries, an assumption is often made regarding the interphase that forms\nbetween the active material and liquid electrolyte at low potentials, the\nso-called solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). The SEI is generally assumed to\nact like an Ohmic resistor despite its complex chemical composition and\nporosity distribution. Here, one reports that this assumption does not hold for\nalkali-ion batteries. The SEI possesses a non-linear overpotential\ncharacteristic which saturates already at low current density of 0.1 mAcm-2\ngiving only 3.3$\\pm$1 mV for Li-metal electrodes in different electrolytes. For\nNa- and K-metal electrodes, these SEI overpotentials become dominating with 31\nmV and 72 mV at the same low current densities giving significant disadvantages\nover Li-ion batteries for commercial applications. With the introduction of a\nnew term, one achieves agreement between the parameters from galvanostatic\ncycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for the first time. The\ndiscovery of the non-linear SEI overpotential disrupts the general believes\nabout the role of the SEI for today's batteries as it is basically negligible\nfor Li-ion batteries at room temperature.\n", "  In the paper an interaction between a soliton and a traveling wave in the\nCoupled Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger Equation (CNLSE) is considered. The force\nacting on the soliton can both push or pull the soliton depending on parameters\nof the equation, structure of the soliton and the incident wave. In special\ncases analytical results are presented and in general numerical solutions of\nboth linearized and the full problem are shown.\n", "  A recent version of statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT), namely\nSAFT2, is coupled with the van der Waals and Platteeuw theory to study the\nalkane hydrate phase equilibrium conditions. The model is found to provide an\naccurate representation of the alkane hydrate dissociation conditions with and\nwithout inhibitors, such as salts, alcohols, as well as mixed salts and\nalcohol. Based on SAFT2, a heterosegmented SAFT equation of state is developed\nto model the thermodynamic properties of aqueous ionic liquid (IL) solutions,\nwhich is recently discovered as dual function gas hydrate inhibitors. With\ntransferrable model parameters, the heterosegmented SAFT generally well\nrepresents the liquid density, activity coefficient, and osmotic coefficient of\naqueous imidazolium IL solutions. The inhibition effects of imidazolium IL on\nmethane hydrate is also studied by the heterosegmented SAFT and the van der\nWaals and Platteeuw theory.\n  The heterosegmented SAFT is then modified to better represent the\nthermodynamic properties of aqueous IL solutions with the help of Monte Carlo\nsimulation and the solutions of Ornstein-Zernike integral equation. A simple\nmodification of MSA, referred to as KMSA, is proposed to accurately predict the\nexcess energies of electrolyte system in mixture with neutral component. Monte\nCarlo simulations are also conducted on flexible charged hard-sphere chain\nmolecules, and a SAFT model which implements either a dimer or a dimer-monomer\napproach to account for the charged chain connectivity is proposed.\n", "  Dynamics reduces the orthorhombicity of magnetic stripes in La_2CuO_4+y. The\nmeasured stripe incommensuration can be used to determine the oxygen content of\nthe sample.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to study the transport equation and its coupling\nwith Maxwell equation in the framework of R^n gravity. Using\nMuller-Israel-Stewart theory for the conduction of dissipative fluids, we\nanalyze the temperature, heat flux, viscosity and thermal conductivity in the\nscenario of relaxation time. All these thermodynamical variables are appeared\nin the form of a single factor whose influence is discussed on the evolution of\nrelativistic model for the heat conducting collapsing star.\n", "  Let $Gr(d,n)$ be the Grassmannian of $d$-dimensional linear subspaces of an\n$n$-dimensional vector space $V$. A submanifold $X\\subset Gr(d, n)$ gives rise\nto a differential system $\\Sigma(X)$ that governs $d$-dimensional submanifolds\nof $V$ whose Gaussian image is contained in $X$. We investigate a special case\nof this construction where $X$ is a sixfold in $Gr(4, 6)$. The corresponding\nsystem $\\Sigma(X)$ reduces to a pair of first-order PDEs for 2 functions of 4\nindependent variables. Equations of this type arise in self-dual Ricci-flat\ngeometry. Our main result is a complete description of integrable systems\n$\\Sigma(X)$. These naturally fall into two subclasses.\n  (1) Systems of Monge-Amp\\`ere type. The corresponding sixfolds $X$ are\ncodimension 2 linear sections of the Pl\\\"ucker embedding\n$Gr(4,6)\\subset\\mathbb{P}^{14}$.\n  (2) General linearly degenerate systems. The corresponding sixfolds $X$ are\nthe images of quadratic maps $\\mathbb{P}^6- Gr(4, 6)$ given by a version of the\nclassical construction of Chasles.\n  We prove that integrability is equivalent to the requirement that the\ncharacteristic variety of system $\\Sigma(X)$ gives rise to a conformal\nstructure which is self-dual on every solution. In fact, all solutions carry\nhyper-Hermitian geometry.\n", "  ATHENA is a large X-ray observatory, planned to be launched by ESA in 2028\ntowards an L2 orbit. One of the two instruments of the payload is the X-IFU: a\ncryogenic spectrometer based on a large array of TES microcalorimeters, able to\nperform integral field spectrography in the 0.2-12 keV band (2.5 eV FWHM at 6\nkeV). The X-IFU sensitivity is highly degraded by the particle background\nexpected in the L2 orbit, which is induced by primary protons of both galactic\nand solar origin, and mostly by secondary electrons. To reduce the particle\nbackground level and enable the mission science goals, the instrument\nincorporates a Cryogenic AntiCoincidence detector (CryoAC). It is a 4 pixel TES\nbased detector, placed <1 mm below the main array. In this paper we report a\nscientific assessment of the CryoAC observational capabilities in the hard\nX-ray band (E>10 keV). The aim of the study has been to understand if the\npresent detector design can be improved in order to enlarge the X-IFU\nscientific capability on an energy band wider than the TES array. This is\nbeyond the CryoAC baseline, being this instrument aimed to operate as\nanticoincidence particle detector and not conceived to perform X-ray\nobservations.\n", "  One of the fundamental restrictions that quantum mechanics imposes is the \"No\ndeletion Theorem\" which tells us that given two identical unknown quantum\nstates, it is impossible to delete one of them. But nevertheless if not\nperfect, people have tried to delete it approximately. In these approximate\ndeleting processes our basic target is to delete one of the two identical\ncopies as much as possible while preserving the other copy. In this brief\nreport, by using the No communication theorem (NCT) (impossibility of sending\nsignal faster than light using a quantum resource) as a guiding principle, we\nobtain a bound on the sum of the fidelity of deletion and the fidelity of\npreservation. Our result not only brings out the complementary relation between\nthese two fidelities but also predicts the optimal value of the fidelity of\ndeletion achievable for a given fidelity of preservation under no signaling\nconstraint. This work eventually saturates the quest for finding out the\noptimal value of deletion within the NCT framework.\n", "  We consider isolated many-body quantum systems which do not thermalize, i.e.,\nexpectation values approach an (approximately) steady longtime limit which\ndisagrees with the microcanonical prediction of equilibrium statistical\nmechanics. A general analytical theory is worked out for the typical temporal\nrelaxation behavior in such cases. The main prerequisites are initial\nconditions which appreciably populate many energy levels and do not give rise\nto significant spatial inhomogeneities on macroscopic scales. The theory\nexplains very well the experimental and numerical findings in a trapped-ion\nquantum simulator exhibiting many-body localization, in ultracold atomic gases,\nand in integrable hard-core boson and XXZ models.\n", "  While the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect and antiferromagnetic order\nconstitute two of the most promising phenomena for embedding basic spintronic\nconcepts into future technologies, almost all of the QSH insulators known to\ndate are non-magnetic. Here, based on tight-binding arguments and\nfirst-principles theory, we predict two-dimensional antiferromagnets with\nhoneycomb lattice structure to exhibit the QSH effect due to the combined\nsymmetry of time reversal and spatial inversion. We identify functionalized Sn\nfilms as experimentally feasible examples which reveal large band gaps\nrendering these systems ideal for energy efficient spintronics applications.\nRemarkably, we discover that tensile strain can tune the magnetic order in\nthese materials, accompanied by a topological phase transition from the QSH to\nthe quantum anomalous Hall phase.\n", "  We report on the on-surface synthesis of 7 armchair graphene nanoribbons\n(7-AGNRs) substituted with nitrile (CN) functional groups. The CN groups are\nattached to the GNR backbone by modifying the 7-AGNR precursor. While many of\nthese groups survive the on-surface synthesis, the reaction process causes the\ncleavage of some CN from the ribbon backbone and the on-surface\ncycloisomerization of few nitriles onto pyridine rings. Scanning Tunneling\nSpectroscopy and Density Functional Theory reveal that CN groups behave as very\nefficient n-dopants, significantly downshifting the bands of the ribbon, and\nintroducing deep impurity levels associated to the nitrogen electron lone\npairs.\n", "  A variety of indices have been proposed in order to represent the many\ndifferent observables modulated by the solar cycle. Most of these indices are\nhighly correlated with each other owing to their intrinsic link with the solar\nmagnetism and the dominant eleven year cycle, but their variations may differ\nin fine details, as well as on short- and long-term trends. In this paper we\npresent an overview of the indices that are often employed to describe the many\nfeatures of the solar cycle, moving from the ones referring to direct\nobservations of the inner solar atmosphere, the photosphere and chromosphere,\nto those deriving from measurements of the transition region and solar corona.\nFor each index, we summarize existing measurements {\\bf and typical use}, and\nfor those that quantify physical observables, we describe the underlying\nphysics.\n", "  The methane-based material (H$_2$)$_4$CH$_4$, also called H4M for short, is\nin essence a methane molecule with 4 physisorbed H$_2$ molecules. While H4M has\nexceptionally high hydrogen storage densities when it forms a molecular solid,\nunfortunately, this solid is only stable at impractically high pressures and/or\nlow temperatures. To overcome this limitation, we show through simulations that\nlonger alkanes (methane is the shortest alkane) also form stable structures\nthat still physisorb 4 H$_2$ molecules per carbon atom; we call those\nstructures H4-alkanes. We further show via molecular dynamics simulations that\nthe stability field of molecular solids formed from H4-alkanes increases\nremarkably with chain length compared to H4M, just as it does for regular\nalkanes. From our simulations of H4-alkanes with lengths 1, 4, 10, and 20, we\nsee that e.g. for the 20-carbon the stability field is doubled at higher\npressures. While even longer chains show only insignificant improvements, we\ndiscuss various other options to stabilize H4-alkanes more. Our\nproof-of-principle results lay the groundwork to show that H4-alkanes can\nbecome viable hydrogen storage materials.\n", "  Using time-, spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, we investigate the\nultrafast spin dynamics of hot electrons on the surface of the topological\ninsulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$ following optical excitation by fs-infrared pulses. We\nobserve two surface-resonance states above the Fermi level coexisting with a\ntransient population of Dirac fermions that relax in about $\\sim$2 ps. One\nstate is located below $\\sim$0.4 eV just above the bulk continuum, the other\none at $\\sim$0.8 eV inside a projected bulk band gap. At the onset of the\nexcitation, both states exhibit a reversed spin texture with respect to that of\nthe transient Dirac bands, in agreement with our one-step photoemission\ncalculations. Our data reveal that the high-energy state undergoes spin\nrelaxation within $\\sim$0.5 ps, a process that triggers the subsequent spin\ndynamics of both the Dirac cone and the low-energy state, which behave as two\ndynamically-locked electron populations. We discuss the origin of this behavior\nby comparing the relaxation times observed for electrons with opposite spins to\nthe ones obtained from a microscopic Boltzmann model of ultrafast band cooling\nintroduced into the photoemission calculations. Our results demonstrate that\nthe nonequilibrium surface dynamics is governed by electron-electron rather\nthan electron-phonon scattering, with a characteristic time scale unambiguously\ndetermined by the complex spin texture of excited states above the Fermi level.\nOur findings reveal the critical importance of detecting momentum and\nenergy-resolved spin textures with fs resolution to fully understand the sub-ps\ndynamics of transient electrons on the surface of topological insulators.\n", "  This material complements David Chandler's Introduction to Modern Statistical\nMechanics (Oxford University Press, 1987) in a graduate-level, one-semester\ncourse I teach in the Department of Chemistry at Duke University. Students\nenter this course with some knowledge of statistical thermodynamics and quantum\nmechanics, usually acquired from undergraduate physical chemistry at the level\nof D. A. McQuarrie & J. D. Simon's Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach\n(University Science Books, 1997). These notes, which introduce students to a\nmodern treatment of glassiness and to the replica method, build on the material\nand problems contained in the eight chapters of Chandler's textbook.\n", "  Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission, we investigate the ultrafast\nresponse of excited electrons in the ternary topological insulator (Bi$_{1\nx}$Sb$_{x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ to fs-infrared pulses. We demonstrate that at the\ncritical concentration $x$=0.55, where the system becomes bulk insulating, a\nsurface voltage can be driven at room temperature through the topological\nsurface state solely by optical means. We further show that such a photovoltage\npersists over a time scale that exceeds $\\sim$6 $\\mu$s, i.e, much longer than\nthe characteristic relaxation times of bulk states. We attribute the origin of\nthe photovoltage to a laser-induced band-bending effect which emerges near the\nsurface region on ultrafast time scales. The photovoltage is also accompanied\nby a remarkable increase in the relaxation times of excited states as compared\nto undoped topological insulators. Our findings are relevant in the context of\napplications of topological surface states in future optical devices.\n", "  We present a simple, analytic model for the accretion flow of an\nincompressible wind onto a gravitating object. This solution corresponds to the\nNewtonian limit of a previously known relativistic model for a fluid obeying a\nstiff equation of state for which the sound speed is constant everywhere and\nequal to the speed of light. The new solution should be useful as a benchmark\ntest for numerical hydrodynamics codes and, moreover, it can be used as an\nillustrative example in a gas dynamics course.\n", "  A simple electronic circuit with a voltage controlled current source is\ninvestigated. The circuit exhibits rich dynamics upon varying the circuit\nelements such as L,C and R, and the control factor of the current source. Among\nseveral other interesting features, the circuit demonstrates two local\nbifurcations, namely, node to spiral and Hopf bifurcation, and a global\nhomoclinic bifurcation. Phase-portraits corresponding to these bifurcations are\npresented and the implications of these bifurcations on system stability are\ndiscussed. In particular, the circuit parameters corresponding to the onset of\nHopf bifurcation may be exploited to design an oscillator with stable frequency\nand amplitude. The circuit may be easily implemented with nonlinear resistive\nelements such as diodes or transistors in saturation and a gyrator block as the\nvoltage controlled current source.\n"]}
