Initiated by\nthe newly developed mass table in the relativistic mean field theory (RMF), in\nthis paper the influence of mass models on the $r$-process calculations is\ninvestigated assuming the same astrophysical conditions. The different model\npredictions on the so far unreachable nuclei lead to significant deviations in\nthe calculated r-process abundances.\n", "  We define a family of spacetimes representing isolated black holes exhibiting\nremarkable universal properties which are natural generalizations from\nstationary spacetimes. They admit a well defined notion of surface gravity k_H.\nThis generalized surface gravity mediates an exponential relation between a\nregular null coordinate w near the horizon and an asymptotic Bondi null\ncoordinate u defined in the vicinity of future null infinity. Our construction\nprovides a framework for the study of gravitational collapse of an isolated\nsystem in its late stage of evolution.\n", "  We calculate explicitly the black-hole temperature for the Schwarzschild\nde-Sitter solution inside massive gravity by defining the Killing-vector in the\ndirection of the St\\\"uckelberg function. We then consider the conditions which\nan observer in massive gravity has to obey in order to agree with the standard\nresults of General Relativity.\n", "  We study resonances of surfaces of revolution obtained by removing a disk\nfrom a cone and attaching a hyperbolic cusp in its place. These surfaces\ninclude ones with nontrapping geodesic flow (every maximally extended\nnon-reflected geodesic is unbounded) and yet infinitely many long living\nresonances (resonances with uniformly bounded imaginary part, i.e. decay rate).\n", "  We give an elementary proof of Burq's resolvent bounds for long range\nsemiclassical Schroedinger operators. Globally, the resolvent norm grows\nexponentially in the inverse semiclassical parameter, and near infinity it\ngrows linearly. We also weaken the regularity assumptions on the potential.\n", "  The strong decays of two narrow mesons $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ and\n$D_{s1}^{'}(2460)$ are studied within the framework of heavy hadron chiral\nperturbation theory. Up to next-to-leading order in $1/\\Lambda_{\\chi}$, by a\nfit to the experimental widths of their nonstrange partners, the chiral\nsymmetry-breaking coupling constants are extracted. The single-pion decay\nwidths are estimated to be $\\Gamma(D_{s0}^{*}(2317)\\to\nD_{s}^{+}\\pi^{0})=9.2\\pm2.3$ KeV and $\\Gamma(D_{s1}^{'}(2460)\\to\nD_{s}^{*+}\\pi^{0})=9.0\\pm2.1$ KeV, respectively, which are consistent with the\nexperimental constraints and comparable with other theoretical predictions. The\nnumerical analysis shows that chiral-symmetry corrections to the decay widths\nare significant. Applications and predictions for the corresponding beauty\nmesons are also provided.\n", "  Introducing both Berry curvature and chiral anomaly into Landau's\nFermi-liquid theory, we construct a topological Fermi-liquid theory, applicable\nto interacting Weyl metals in the absence of time reversal symmetry. Following\nthe Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, we obtain an effective free-energy functional\nin terms of the density field of chiral fermions. The density field of chiral\nfermions is determined by a self-consistent equation, minimizing the effective\nfree-energy functional with respect to the order-parameter field. Beyond these\nthermodynamic properties, we construct Boltzmann transport theory to encode\nboth the Berry curvature and the chiral anomaly in the presence of forward\nscattering of a Fermi-liquid state, essential for understanding dynamic\ncorrelations in interacting Weyl metals. This generalizes the Boltzmann\ntransport theory for the Landau's Fermi-liquid state in the respect of\nincorporating the topological structure and extends that for noninteracting\nWeyl metals in the sense of introducing the forward scattering. Finally, we\njustify this topological Fermi-liquid theory, generalizing the\nfirst-quantization description for noninteracting Weyl metals into the\nsecond-quantization representation for interacting Weyl metals. First, we\nderive a topological Fermi-gas theory, integrating over high-energy electronic\ndegrees of freedom deep inside a pair of chiral Fermi surfaces. As a result, we\nreproduce a topological Drude model with both the Berry curvature and the\nchiral anomaly. Second, we take into account interactions between such\nlow-energy chiral fermions on the pair of chiral Fermi surfaces. We perform the\nrenormalization group analysis, and find that only forward scattering turns out\nto be marginal above possible superconducting transition temperatures,\njustifying the topological Fermi-liquid theory of interacting Weyl metals with\ntime reversal symmetry breaking.\n", "  The availability of geocoded health data and the inherent temporal structure\nof communicable diseases have led to an increased interest in statistical\nmodels and software for spatio-temporal data with epidemic features. The open\nsource R package surveillance can handle various levels of aggregation at which\ninfective events have been recorded: individual-level time-stamped\ngeo-referenced data (case reports) in either continuous space or discrete\nspace, as well as counts aggregated by period and region. For each of these\ndata types, the surveillance package implements tools for visualization,\nlikelihoood inference and simulation from recently developed statistical\nregression frameworks capturing endemic and epidemic dynamics. Altogether, this\npaper is a guide to the spatio-temporal modeling of epidemic phenomena,\nexemplified by analyses of public health surveillance data on measles and\ninvasive meningococcal disease.\n", "  We compute the partition function of four-dimensional abelian gauge theory on\na general four-torus T4 with flat metric using Dirac quantization. In addition\nto an SL(4, Z) symmetry, it possesses SL(2,Z) symmetry that is electromagnetic\nS-duality. We show explicitly how this SL(2, Z) S-duality of the 4d abelian\ngauge theory has its origin in symmetries of the 6d (2,0) tensor theory, by\ncomputing the partition function of a single fivebrane compactified on T2 x T4,\nwhich has SL(2,Z) x SL(4,Z) symmetry. If we identify the couplings of the\nabelian gauge theory \\tau = {\\theta\\over 2\\pi} + i{4\\pi\\over e^2} with the\ncomplex modulus of the T2 torus, \\tau = \\beta^2 + i {R_1\\over R_2}, then in the\nsmall T2 limit, the partition function of the fivebrane tensor field can be\nfactorized, and contains the partition function of the 4d gauge theory. In this\nway the SL(2,Z) symmetry of the 6d tensor partition function is identified with\nthe S-duality symmetry of the 4d gauge partition function. Each partition\nfunction is the product of zero mode and oscillator contributions, where the\nSL(2,Z) acts suitably. For the 4d gauge theory, which has a Lagrangian, this\nproduct redistributes when using path integral quantization.\n", "  Using simple arguments, we show that charge-exchange reactions at high\nenergies go through the hard scattering of fast quarks. On this basis we\ndescribe $\\pi^- p \\to M^0 n$ and $K^- p \\to M^0 \\Lambda$, $M^0 =\\pi^0, \\eta,\n\\eta'$, in a combined approach which defines hard contributions in the parton\nmodel and soft ones in Regge phenomenology. The disappearance of a dip\naccording to recent GAMS-4$\\pi$ data in the differential cross-section $K^- p\n\\to \\eta\\Lambda$ at $|t| \\approx$ 0.4--0.5 (GeV$\\!$/c)$^2$ at transition to\nrelatively high momenta, is explained as a manifestation of a mode change of\nsummation of hard contributions from coherent to incoherent. Other\nmanifestations of the mentioned mode change are discussed. Constraints on the\n$\\eta$--$\\eta'$ mixing and gluonium admixture in $\\eta'$ are obtained.\n", "  Routine public health surveillance of notifiable infectious diseases gives\nrise to weekly counts of reported cases -- possibly stratified by region and/or\nage group. We investigate how an age-structured social contact matrix can be\nincorporated into a spatio-temporal endemic-epidemic model for infectious\ndisease counts. To illustrate the approach, we analyze the spread of norovirus\ngastroenteritis over 6 age groups within the 12 districts of Berlin, 2011-2015,\nusing contact data from the POLYMOD study. The proposed age-structured model\noutperforms alternative scenarios with homogeneous or no mixing between age\ngroups. An extended contact model suggests a power transformation of the\nsurvey-based contact matrix towards more within-group transmission.\n", "  Currently there is much interest in Hamiltonians that are not Hermitian but\ninstead possess an antilinear $PT$ symmetry, since such Hamiltonians can still\nlead to the time-independent evolution of scalar products, and can still have\nan entirely real energy spectrum. However, such theories can also admit of\nenergy spectra in which energies come in complex conjugate pairs, and can even\nadmit of Hamiltonians that cannot be diagonalized at all. Hermiticity is just a\nparticular realization of $PT$ symmetry, with $PT$ symmetry being the more\ngeneral. These $PT$ theories are themselves part of an even broader class of\ntheories, theories that can be characterized by possessing some general\nantilinear symmetry, as that requirement alone is a both necessary and\nsufficient condition for the time-independent evolution of scalar products,\nwith all the different realizations of the $PT$ symmetry program then being\nobtained. Use of complex Lorentz invariance allows us to show that the\nantilinear symmetry is uniquely specified to be $CPT$, with the $CPT$ theorem\nthus being extended to the non-Hermitian case. For theories that are separately\ncharge conjugation invariant, the results of the $PT$-symmetry program then\nfollow. We show that in order to construct the correct classical action needed\nfor a path integral quantization one must impose $CPT$ symmetry on each\nclassical path, a requirement that has no counterpart in any Hermiticity\ncondition since Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian is only definable after the\nquantization has been performed and the quantum Hilbert space has been\nconstructed. We show that whether or not a $CPT$-invariant Hamiltonian is\nHermitian is a property of the solutions to the theory and not of the\nHamiltonian itself. Thus Hermiticity never needs to be postulated at all.\n", "  Many fields require computing the trace of the inverse of a large, sparse\nmatrix. The typical method used for such computations is the Hutchinson method\nwhich is a Monte Carlo (MC) averaging over matrix quadratures. To improve its\nconvergence, several variance reductions techniques have been proposed. In this\npaper, we study the effects of deflating the near null singular value space. We\nmake two main contributions.\n  First, we analyze the variance of the Hutchinson method as a function of the\ndeflated singular values and vectors. Although this provides good intuition in\ngeneral, by assuming additionally that the singular vectors are random unitary\nmatrices, we arrive at concise formulas for the deflated variance that include\nonly the variance and mean of the singular values. We make the remarkable\nobservation that deflation may increase variance for Hermitian matrices but not\nfor non-Hermitian ones. This is a rare, if not unique, property where\nnon-Hermitian matrices outperform Hermitian ones. The theory can be used as a\nmodel for predicting the benefits of deflation.\n  Second, we use deflation in the context of a large scale application of\n\"disconnected diagrams\" in Lattice QCD. On lattices, Hierarchical Probing (HP)\nhas previously provided an order of magnitude of variance reduction over MC by\nremoving \"error\" from neighboring nodes of increasing distance in the lattice.\nAlthough deflation used directly on MC yields a limited improvement of 30% in\nour problem, when combined with HP they reduce variance by a factor of over 60\ncompared to MC. For this, we pre-computated 1000 smallest singular values of an\nill-conditioned matrix of size 25 million. Using PRIMME and a domain-specific\nAlgebraic Multigrid preconditioner, we perform one of the largest eigenvalue\ncomputations in Lattice QCD at a fraction of the cost of our trace computation.\n", "  In this letter we propose a superadiabatic protocol where quantum state\ntransfer can be achieved with arbitrarily high accuracy and minimal control\nacross long spin chains with an odd number of spins. The quantum state transfer\nprotocol only requires the control of the couplings between the qubits on the\nedge and the spin chain. We predict fidelities above 0.99 for an evolution of\nnanoseconds using typical spin exchange coupling values of {\\mu}eV.\nFurthermore, by building a superadiabatic formalism on top of this protocol, we\npropose a effective superadiabatic protocol that retains the minimal control\nover the spin chain and improves the fidelity by up to 20%.\n", "  We have submitted to MAST the 1.5 version data release of the Hubble Legacy\nFields (HLF) project covering a 25 x 25 arcmin area over the GOODS-S (ECDF-S)\nregion from the HST archival program AR-13252. The release combines exposures\nfrom Hubble's two main cameras, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS/WFC) and\nthe Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3/IR), taken over more than a decade between\nmid-2002 to the end of 2016. The HLF includes essentially all optical (ACS/WFC\nF435W, F606W, F775W, F814W and F850LP filters) and infrared (WFC3/ IR F098M,\nF105W, F125W, F140W and F160W filters) data taken by Hubble over the original\nCDF-S region including the GOODS-S, ERS, CANDELS and many other programs (31 in\ntotal). The data has been released at https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hlf/ as\nimages with a common astrometric reference frame, with corresponding inverse\nvariance weight maps. We provide one image per filter of WFC3/IR images at 60\nmas per pixel resolution and two ACS/WFC images per filter, at both 30 and 60\nmas per pixel. Since this comprehensive dataset combines data from 31 programs\non the GOODS-S/CDF-S, the AR proposal identified the MAST products by the\nglobal name \"Hubble Legacy Field\", with this region being identified by\n\"HLF-GOODS-S\". This dataset complements that of the Frontier Fields program.\nThe total incorporated in the HLF-GOODS-S is 5.8 Msec in 7211 exposures from\n2442 orbits. This is ~70% of a HST full cycle!\n", "  We report long-term simulations of black hole-neutron star binary mergers\nwhere the neutron star possesses an asymmetric magnetic field dipole. Focusing\non the scenario where the neutron star is tidally disrupted by the black hole,\nwe track the evolution of the binary up to $\\approx 100$ms after the merger. We\nuncover more than one episode of thermally driven winds being launched along a\nfunnel wall in all these cases beginning from $\\approx 25$ms after the merger.\nOn the other hand, we are unable to conclude presently whether the amount of\nejected mass increases with the \\it{degree} of asymmetry. A large-scale\nmagnetic field configuration in the poloidal direction is formed along the\nfunnel wall accompanied by the generation of a large Poynting flux. The\nmagnetic field in the accretion disk around the black hole remnant is amplified\nby the nonaxisymmetric magnetorotational instability (MRI). The MRI growth is\nestimated to be in the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) regime and thus would\nbe free from significant effects induced by potential neutrino radiation.\nHowever, the asymmetry in the magnetic field leads to increased turbulence,\nwhich causes the vertical magnetic field in the accretion disk to grow largely\nin a nonlinear manner.\n", "  Using density functional theory combined with a semi-empirical van der Waals\ndispersion correction, we have investigated the stability of lattice defects\nincluding boron vacancy, substitutional and interstitial X (X=H, C, B, N, O)\nand $\\Sigma$5 tilt grain boundaries in borophene and their influence on the\nanisotropic mechanical properties of this two-dimensional system. The pristine\nborophene has significant in-plane Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio\nanisotropy due to its strong and highly coordinated B-B bonds. The\nconcentration of B vacancy and $\\Sigma$5 grain boundary could be rather high\ngiven that their formation energies are as low as 0.10 eV and 0.06 eV/$\\AA$\nrespectively. In addition, our results also suggest that borophene can react\neasily with H$_2$, O$_2$ and N$_2$ when exposed to these molecules. We find\nthat the mechanical properties of borophene are remarkably degraded by these\ndefects. The anisotropy in Poisson's ratio, however, can be tuned by some of\nthem. Furthermore, the adsorbed H or substitutional C may induce remarkably\nnegative Poisson's ratio in borophene, and the substitutional C or N can\nsignificantly increase the Poisson's ratio by contrast.\n", "  The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which captures the most striking\ntransport properties of the conductive organic polymer $trans$-polyacetylene,\nprovides perhaps the most basic model system supporting topological\nexcitations. The alternating bond pattern of polyacetylene chains is captured\nby the bipartite sublattice structure of the SSH model, emblematic of\none-dimensional chiral symmetric topological insulators. This structure\nsupports two distinct nontrivial topological phases, which, when interfaced\nwith one another or with a topologically trivial phase, give rise to\ntopologically-protected, dispersionless boundary states. Using $^{87}$Rb atoms\nin a momentum-space lattice, we realize fully-tunable condensed matter\nHamiltonians, allowing us to probe the dynamics and equilibrium properties of\nthe SSH model. We report on the experimental quantum simulation of this model\nand observation of the localized topological soliton state through quench\ndynamics, phase-sensitive injection, and adiabatic preparation.\n", "  The conservation laws of continuum mechanic written in an Eulerian frame make\nno difference between fluids and solids except in the expression of the stress\ntensors, usually with Newton's hypothesis for the fluids and Helmholtz\npotentials of energy for hyperelastic solids. By taking the velocities as\nunknown , monolithic methods for fluid structure interactions (FSI) are built.\nIn this article such a formulation is analyzed when the fluid is compressible\nand the fluid is incompressible. The idea is not new but the progress of mesh\ngenerators and numerical schemes like the Characteristics-Galerkin method\nrender this approach feasible and reasonably robust. In this article the method\nand its discretization are presented, stability is discussed by through an\nenergy estimate. A numerical section discusses implementation issues and\npresents a few simple tests.\n", "  Similarities between force-driven compression experiments of porous materials\nand earthquakes have been recently proposed. In this manuscript, we measure the\nacoustic emission during displacement-driven compression of a porous glass. The\nenergy of acoustic-emission events shows that the failure process exhibits\navalanche scale-invariance and therefore follows the Gutenberg-Richter law. The\nresulting exponents do not exhibit significant differences with respect the\nforce-driven case. Furthermore, the force exhibits an avalanche-type behaviour\nfor which the force drops are power-law distributed and correlated with the\nacoustic emission events.\n", "  Motivated by a recent experiment in ultracold atoms [ S. Krinner et al.,\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 113, 8144 (2016)], we analyze transport of\nattractively interacting fermions through a one-dimensional wire near the\nsuperfluid transition. We show that in a ballistic regime where the conductance\nis quantized in the absence of interaction, the conductance is renormalized by\nsuperfluid fluctuations in reservoirs. In particular, the particle conductance\nis strongly enhanced and the plateau is blurred by emergent bosonic pair\ntransport. For spin transport, in addition to the contact resistance the wire\nitself is resistive, leading to a suppression of the measured spin conductance.\nOur results are qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations.\n", "  In this paper we first compute the out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC) for\nboth a phenomenological model and a random-field XXZ model in the many-body\nlocalized phase. We show that the OTOC decreases in power law in a many-body\nlocalized system at the scrambling time. We also find that the OTOC can also be\nused to distinguish a many-body localized phase from an Anderson localized\nphase, while a normal correlator cannot. Furthermore, we prove an exact theorem\nthat relates the growth of the second R\\'enyi entropy in the quench dynamics to\nthe decay of the OTOC in equilibrium. This theorem works for a generic quantum\nsystem. We discuss various implications of this theorem.\n", "  The quantization of the electromagnetic field has successfully paved the way\nfor the development of the Standard Model of Particle Physics and has\nestablished the basis for quantum technologies. Gravity, however, continues to\nhold out against physicists' efforts of including it into the framework of\nquantum theory. Experimental techniques in quantum optics have only recently\nreached the precision and maturity required for the investigation of quantum\nsystems under the influence of gravitational fields. Here, we report on\nexperiments in which a genuine quantum state of an entangled photon pair was\nexposed to a series of different accelerations. We measure an entanglement\nwitness for $g$ values ranging from 30 mg to up to 30 g - under free-fall as\nwell on a spinning centrifuge - and have thus derived an upper bound on the\neffects of uniform acceleration on photonic entanglement. Our work represents\nthe first quantum optics experiment in which entanglement is systematically\ntested in geodesic motion as well as in accelerated reference frames with\nacceleration a>>g = 9.81 m/s^2.\n", "  We consider excitons in a two-dimensional periodic potential and study the\nlinear response of the excitonic superfluid to an electromagnetic wave at low\nand high densities. It turns out that the static structure factor for small\nwavevectors is very sensitive to a change of density and temperature. It is a\nconsequence of the fact that thermal fluctuations play a crucial role at small\nwavevectors, since exchanging the order of the two limits, zero temperature and\nvanishing wavevector, leads to different results for the structure factor. This\neffect could be used for high accuracy measurements in the superfluid exciton\nphase, which might be realized by a gated electron-hole gas. The transition of\nthe exciton system from the superfluid state to a non-superfluid state and its\nmanifestation by light scattering are discussed.\n", "  Knowledge of the stellar content near the Sun is important for a broad range\nof topics ranging from the search for planets to the study of Milky Way\nstructure. The most powerful method for identifying potentially nearby stars is\nproper motion (PM) surveys. All old optical surveys avoid, or are at least\nsubstantially incomplete, near the Galactic plane. The depth and breadth of the\n\"Vista Variables in Via Lactea\" (VVV) near-IR survey significantly improves\nthis situation. Taking advantage of the VVV survey database, we have measured\nPMs in the densest regions of the MW bulge and southern plane in order to\ncomplete the census of nearby objects. We have developed a custom PM pipeline\nbased on VVV catalogues from the Cambridge Astronomy Survey Unit (CASU), by\ncomparing the first epoch of JHKs with the multi-epoch Ks-bands acquired later.\nTaking advantage of the large time baseline between the 2MASS and the VVV\nobservations, we also obtained 2MASS-VVV PMs. We present a near-IR proper\nmotion catalogue for the whole area of the VVV survey, which includes 3003\nmoving stellar sources. All of these have been visually inspected and are real\nPM objects. Our catalogue is in very good agreement with the proper motion data\nsupplied in IR catalogues outside the densest zone of the MW. The majority of\nthe PM objects in our catalogue are nearby M-dwarfs, as expected. This new\ndatabase allow us to identify 57 common proper motion binary candidates, among\nwhich are two new systems within ~30pc of the Sun.\n", "  QUBIC is an instrument aiming at measuring the B mode polarisation\nanisotropies at medium scales angular scales (30-200 multipoles). The search\nfor the primordial CMB B-mode polarization signal is challenging, because of\nmany difficulties: smallness of the expected signal, instrumental systematics\nthat could possibly induce polarization leakage from the large E signal into B,\nbrighter than anticipated polarized foregrounds (dust) reducing to zero the\ninitial hope of finding sky regions clean enough to have a direct primordial\nB-modes observation. The QUBIC instrument is designed to address all aspects of\nthis challenge with a novel kind of instrument, a Bolometric Interferometer,\ncombining the background-limited sensitivity of Transition-Edge-Sensors and the\ncontrol of systematics allowed by the observation of interference fringe\npatterns, while operating at two frequencies to disentangle polarized\nforegrounds from primordial B mode polarization. Its characteristics are\ndescribed in details in this Technological Design Report.\n", "  We analyse the most general bosonic supersymmetric solutions of type IIB\nsupergravity whose metrics are warped products of five-dimensional anti-de\nSitter space (AdS$_5$) with a five-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M_{5}$,\nwhere the five-form flux vanishes, while all remaining fluxes are allowed to be\nnon-vanishing consistent with SO(4,2) symmetry. This completes the program of\nclassifying all supersymmetric solutions of ten and eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity with an AdS$_5$ factor. We investigate the supersymmetry\nconditions in some special cases, and demonstrate how these are satisfied by a\nsolution originally found in arXiv:1410.2650[hep-th], utilising the method of\nnon-Abelian T-duality.\n", "  In this work we analyse the structure of the thermodynamic arrow of time,\ndefined by transformations that leave the thermal equilibrium state unchanged,\nin classical (incoherent) and quantum (coherent) regimes. We note that in the\ninfinite-temperature limit the thermodynamic ordering of states in both regimes\nexhibits a lattice structure. This means that when energy does not matter and\nthe only thermodynamic resource is given by information, the thermodynamic\narrow of time has a very specific structure. Namely, for any two states at\npresent there exists a unique state in the past consistent with them and with\nall possible joint pasts. Similarly, there also exists a unique state in the\nfuture consistent with those states and with all possible joint futures. We\nalso show that the lattice structure in the classical regime is broken at\nfinite temperatures, i.e., when energy is a relevant thermodynamic resource.\nSurprisingly, however, we prove that in the simplest quantum scenario of a\ntwo-dimensional system, this structure is preserved at finite temperatures. We\nprovide the physical interpretation of these results by introducing and\nanalysing the history erasure process, and point out that quantum coherence may\nbe a necessary resource for the existence of an optimal erasure process.\n", "  Currently, the mainstream approach to quantum computing is through surface\ncodes. One way to store and manipulate quantum information with these to create\ndefects in the codes which can be moved and used as if they were particles.\nSpecifically, they simulate the behaviour of exotic particles known as\nMajoranas, which are a kind of non-Abelian anyon. By exchanging these\nparticles, important gates for quantum computation can be implemented. Here we\ninvestigate the simplest possible exchange operation for two surface code\nMajoranas. This is found to act non-trivially on only five qubits. The system\nis then truncated to these five qubits, so that the exchange process can be run\non the IBM 5Q processor. The results demonstrate the expected effect of the\nexchange. This paper has been written in a style that should hopefully be\naccessible to both professional and amateur scientists.\n", "  The quantum Hall (QH) effect supports a set of chiral edge states at the\nboundary of a 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) system. A superconductor (SC)\ncontacting these states induces correlation of the quasi-particles in the\ndissipationless 1D chiral QH edge states. If the superconducting electrode is\nnarrower than the superconducting coherence length, the incoming electron are\ncorrelated to outgoing hole along the chiral edge state by the Andreev process.\nIn order to realize this crossed Andreev conversion (CAC), it is necessary to\nfabricate highly transparent and nanometer-scale superconducting junctions to\nQH system. Here we report the observation of CAC in a graphene QH system\ncontacted with a nanostructured NbN superconducting electrode. The chemical\npotential of the edge states across the superconducting electrode exhibits a\nsign reversal, providing direct evidence of CAC. This hybrid SC/QH system is a\nnovel route to create isolated non-Abelian anyonic zero modes, in resonance\nwith the chiral QH edge.\n", "  Plastic scintillation detectors for Time-of-Flight (TOF) measurements are\nalmost essential for event-by-event identification of relativistic rare\nisotopes. In this work, a pair of plastic scintillation detectors of 50\n$\\times$ 50 $\\times$ 3$^{t}$ mm$^3$ and 80 $\\times$ 100 $\\times$ 3$^{t}$ mm$^3$\nhave been set up at the external target facility (ETF), Institute of Modern\nPhysics. Their time, energy and position responses are measured with $^{18}$O\nprimary beam at 400 MeV/nucleon. After the off-line walk-effect and position\ncorrections, the time resolution of the two detectors are determined to be 27\nps ($\\sigma$) and 36 ps ($\\sigma$), respectively. Both detectors have nearly\nthe same energy resolution of 3$\\%$ ($\\sigma$) and position resolution of 2 mm\n($\\sigma$). The detectors have been used successfully in nuclear reaction cross\nsection measurements, and will be be employed for upgrading RIBLL2 beam line at\nIMP as well as for the high energy branch at HIAF.\n", "  White matter tract integrity (WMTI) can characterize brain microstructure in\nareas with highly aligned fiber bundles. Several WMTI biomarkers have now been\nvalidated against microscopy and provided promising results in studies of brain\ndevelopment and aging, and in a number of brain disorders. Currently, WMTI is\nmostly used in dedicated animal studies and clinical studies of slowly\nprogressing diseases but has not yet emerged as a routine clinical tool. To\nthis end, a less data intensive experimental method would be beneficial by\nenabling high resolution validation studies, and ease clinical applications by\nspeeding up data acquisition compared to typical diffusion kurtosis imaging\n(DKI) protocols utilized as part of WMTI imaging. Here, we evaluate WMTI based\non recently introduced axially symmetric DKI which has lower data demand than\nconventional DKI. We compare WMTI parameters derived from conventional DKI to\nthose calculated analytically from axially symmetric DKI. We employ numerical\nsimulations, as well as data from fixed rat spinal cord (1) and in vivo human\n(3) and rat brain (4). Our analysis shows that analytical WMTI based on axially\nsymmetric DKI with sparse data sets (19 images) produces WMTI metrics that\ncorrelate strongly with estimates based on traditional DKI data sets (60 images\nor more). We demonstrate the preclinical potential of the proposed WMTI\ntechnique in in vivo rat brain (300 {\\mu}m isotropic resolution with whole\nbrain coverage). WMTI parameter estimates are subject to a duality leading to\ntwo solution branches dependent on a sign choice which is currently debated.\nResults from both of these branches are presented and discussed throughout our\nanalysis. The proposed fast WMTI approach may be useful for preclinical\nresearch and e.g. clinical evaluation of patients with traumatic white matter\ninjuries or symptoms of neurovascular or neuroinflammatory disorders.\n", "  Sunspots are concentrations of magnetic field visible on the solar surface\n(photosphere). It was considered implausible that solar flares, as resulted\nfrom magnetic reconnection in the tenuous corona, would cause a direct\nperturbation of the dense photosphere involving bulk motion. Here we report the\nsudden flare-induced rotation of a sunspot using the unprecedented\nspatiotemporal resolution of the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope, supplemented by\nmagnetic data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. It is clearly observed that\nthe rotation is non-uniform over the sunspot: as the flare ribbon sweeps\nacross, its different portions accelerate (up to 50 deg per hr) at different\ntimes corresponding to peaks of flare hard X-ray emission. The rotation may be\ndriven by the surface Lorentz-force change due to the back reaction of coronal\nmagnetic restructuring and is accompanied by a downward Poynting flux. These\nresults have direct consequences for our understanding of energy and momentum\ntransportation in the flare-related phenomena.\n", "  Quantum systems driven by strong oscillating fields are the source of many\ninteresting physical phenomena. In this work, we experimentally study the\ndynamics of a two-level system of a single spin driven in the strong-driving\nregime where the rotating-wave approximation is not valid. This two-level\nsystem is a subsystem of a single Nitrogen-Vacancy center coupled to a\nfirst-shell $^{13}$C nuclear spin in diamond at a level anti-crossing point\nthat occurs in the $m_{s}=\\pm1$ manifold when the energy level splitting\nbetween the $m_{s}$ = $+1$ and $-1$ spin states due to the static magnetic\nfield is $\\approx$ 127 MHz, which is roughly equal to the spectral splitting\ndue to the $^{13}$C hyperfine interaction. The transition frequency of this\nelectron spin two-level system in a static magnetic field of 28.9 G is 1.7 MHz\nand it can be driven only by the $z$-component of the RF field. Electron spin\nRabi frequencies in this system can reach tens of MHz even for moderate RF\npowers. The simple sinusoidal Rabi oscillations that occur when the amplitude\nof the driving field is much smaller than the transition frequency become\ncomplex when the driving field strength is comparable or greater than the\nenergy level splitting. We observe that the system oscillates faster than the\namplitude of the driving field and the response of the system shows multiple\nfrequencies.\n", "  We present study of the complex event consisting of several solar wind\ntransients detected by Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) on 4 -- 7 August\n2011, that caused a geomagnetic storm with Dst$=-$110 nT. The supposed coronal\nsources -- three flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) occurred on 2 -- 4\nAugust 2011 in the active region (AR) 11261. To investigate the solar origin\nand formation of these transients we studied kinematic and thermodynamic\nproperties of the expanding coronal structures using the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) EUV images and the\ndifferential emission measure (DEM) diagnostics. The Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager (HMI) magnetic field maps were used as the input data for the 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to describe the flux rope ejection. We\ncharacterize the early phase of the flux rope ejection in the corona, where the\nusual three-component CME structure formed. The flux rope ejected with a speed\nof about 200~km~s$^{-1}$ to the height of 0.25~R$_{\\odot}$. The kinematics of\nthe modeled CME front agrees well with the Solar Terrestrial Relations\nObservatory (STEREO) EUV measurements. Using the results of the plasma\ndiagnostics and MHD modeling, we calculated the ion charge ratios of carbon and\noxygen as well as the mean charge state of iron ions of the 2 August 2011 CME,\ntaking into account the processes of heating, cooling, expansion, ionization,\nand recombination of the moving plasma in the corona up to the frozen-in\nregion. We estimated a probable heating rate of the CME plasma in the low\ncorona by matching the calculated ion composition parameters of the CME with\nthose measured in situ for the solar wind transients. We also consider the\nsimilarities and discrepancies between the results of the MHD simulation and\nthe observations.\n", "  This is a contribution for the Proceedings of the Conference Hot Quarks 2016,\nheld at South Padre Island, Texas, USA, 12-17 September 2016. I briefly review\nsome thermodynamic and baryon transport results obtained from a bottom-up\nEinstein-Maxwell-Dilaton holographic model engineered to describe the physics\nof the quark-gluon plasma at finite temperature and baryon density. The results\nfor the equation of state, baryon susceptibilities, and the curvature of the\ncrossover band are in quantitative agreement with the corresponding lattice QCD\nresults with $2+1$ flavors and physical quark masses. Baryon diffusion is\npredicted to be suppressed by increasing the baryon chemical potential.\n", "  We calculate the transport properties of multilayer graphene, considering the\neffect of multisubband scattering in a high density regime, where higher\nsubbands are occupied by charge carriers. To calculate the conductivity of\nmultilayer graphene, we use the coupled multiband Boltzmann transport theory\nwhile fully incorporating the multiband scattering effects. We show that the\nallowed scattering channels, screening effects, chiral nature of the electronic\nstructure, and type of impurity scatterings determine the transport behavior of\nmultilayer graphene. We find that the conductivity of multilayer graphene shows\na sudden change when the carriers begin to occupy the higher subbands, and\ntherefore a large negative transconductance (NTC) appears as the carrier\ndensity varies. These phenomena arise mostly from the intersubband scattering\nand the change in the density of states at the band touching density. Based on\nour results, it is possible to build novel devices utilizing the large NTC in\nmultilayer graphene.\n", "  In the present paper we explore the Hawking radiation as a quantum tunneling\neffect from a rotating 5 dimensional Myers-Perry black hole (5D-MPBH) with two\nindependent angular momentum components. First, we investigate the Hawking\ntemperature by considering the tunneling of massive scalar particles and spin-1\nvector particles from the 5D-MPBH in the Painlev\\'{e} coordinates and then in\nthe corotating frames. More specifically, we solve the Klein-Gordon and Proca\nequations by applying the WKB method and Hamilton-Jacobi equation in both\ncases. Finally, we recover the Hawking temperature and show that coordinates\nsystems do not affect the Hawking temperature.\n", "  We study the electro-optic properties of subwavelength-pitch deformed-helix\nferroelectric liquid crystals (DHFLC) illuminated with unpolarized light. In\nthe experimental setup based on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, it was\nobserved that the reference and the sample beams being both unpolarized produce\nthe interference pattern which is insensitive to rotation of in-plane optical\naxes of the DHFLC cell. We find that the field-induced shift of the\ninterference fringes can be described in terms of the electrically dependent\nPancharatnam relative phase determined by the averaged phase shift, whereas the\nvisibility of the fringes is solely dictated by the phase retardation.\n", "  In this paper, we present the Noether symmetries of locally rotationally\nsymmetric Bianchi type I (LRS BI), an anisotropic model, in the context of the\nteleparallel gravity. We study a certain modified teleparallel theory based on\nthe action that, in particular, contains a coupling between the scalar field\nand field strength (magnetism part). We derive the symmetry generators and show\nthat, by means of cyclic variables approach, we can not obtain a suitable\nsolution for field equations. Hence by the use of B.N.S. approach, we solve the\nequations which carry Noether currents as well. By data analysis of the\nobtained results, we show compatible results with observational data at the\nlast half the age of universe which is accelerating.\n", "  The invariance of the standard model (SM) under the CPT transformation\npredicts equality of particle and antiparticle masses. This prediction is\ntested by measuring the mass difference between the top quark and antiquark\n(Delta m[t] = m[t] - m[t-bar]) that are produced in pp collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, using events with a muon or an electron and at\nleast four jets in the final state. The analysis is based on data corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of 19.6 inverse femtobarns collected by the CMS\nexperiment at the LHC, and yields a value of Delta m[t] = -0.15 +/- 0.19 (stat)\n+/- 0.09 (syst) GeV, which is consistent with the SM expectation. This result\nis significantly more precise than previously reported measurements.\n", "  Deep inelastic scattering of very high-energy neutrinos can potentially be\nenhanced by the production of a single top quark or charm quark via the\ninteraction of a virtual $W$-boson exchange with a $b$-quark or $s$-quark\nparton in the nucleon. The single top contribution shows a sharp rise at\nneutrino energies above 0.5 PeV and gives a cross-section contribution of order\n5 percent at 10 PeV, while single charm has a low energy threshold and\ncontributes about 25 percent. Semi-leptonic decays of top and charm give\ndi-muon events whose kinematic characteristics are shown. The angular\nseparation of the di-muons from heavy quark production in the IceCube detector\ncan reach up to one degree. Top quark production has a unique, but rare, three\nmuon signal.\n", "  A detailed exposition of highly efficient and accurate method for the\npropagation of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation is presented. The\nmethod is readily generalized to solve an arbitrary set of ODE's. The\npropagation is based on a global approach, in which large time-intervals are\ntreated as a whole, replacing the local considerations of the common\npropagators. The new method is suitable for various classes of problems,\nincluding problems with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, nonlinear problems,\nnon-Hermitian problems and problems with an inhomogeneous source term. In this\npaper, a thorough presentation of the basic principles of the propagator is\ngiven. We give also a special emphasis on the details of the numerical\nimplementation of the method. For the first time, we present the application\nfor a non-Hermitian problem by a numerical example of a one-dimensional atom\nunder the influence of an intense laser field. The efficiency of the method is\ndemonstrated by a comparison with the common Runge-Kutta approach.\n", "  We demonstrate the non-renormalization of the Chiral Separation Effect (CSE)\nin quenched finite-density QCD in both confinement and deconfinement phases\nusing a recently developed numerical method which allows, for the first time,\nto address the transport properties of exactly chiral, dense lattice fermions.\nThis finding suggests that CSE can be used to fix renormalization constants for\naxial current density. Explaining the suppression of the CSE which we observe\nfor topologically nontrivial gauge field configurations on small lattices, we\nalso argue that CSE vanishes for self-dual non-Abelian fields inside instanton\ncores.\n", "  We establish a noncommutative generalisation of the Borel-Weil theorem for\nthe Heckenberger-Kolb calculus of the quantum Grassmannians. The result is\npresented in the framework of noncommutative complex and holomorphic structures\nand generalises previous work of a number of authors on quantum projective\nspace. As a direct consequence we get a novel holomorphic presentation of the\ntwisted Grassmannian coordinate ring studied in noncommutative algebraic\ngeometry.\n", "  The use of lab notebooks for scientific documentation is a ubiquitous part of\nphysics research. However, it is common for undergraduate physics laboratory\ncourses not to emphasize the development of documentation skills, despite the\nfact that such courses are some of the earliest opportunities for students to\nstart engaging in this practice. One potential impediment to the inclusion of\nexplicit documentation training is that it may be unclear to instructors which\nfeatures of authentic documentation practice are efficacious to teach and how\nto incorporate these features into the lab class environment. In this work, we\noutline some of the salient features of authentic documentation, informed by\ninterviews with physics researchers, and provide recommendations for how these\ncan be incorporated into the lab curriculum. We do not focus on structural\ndetails or templates for notebooks. Instead, we address holistic considerations\nfor the purpose of scientific documentation that can guide students to develop\ntheir own documentation style. Taking into consideration all the aspects that\ncan help improve students' documentation, it is also important to consider the\ndesign of the lab activities themselves. Students should have experience with\nimplementing these authentic features of documentation during lab activities in\norder for them to find practice with documentation beneficial.\n", "  We investigate the bounds on tau-mu lepton flavor violation (LFV). Our main\nfocus is on the collider constrains on tau-mu LFV. We use the Type-III\nTwo-Higgs-Doublet-Model (2HDM) as a set up for our study. While the LFV\nbranching fraction of the 125 GeV is well constrained by current LHC searches,\nthe heavier neutral states could have a large branching fraction to tau and\nmuon. We estimate the LHC reach for the 13 TeV center of mass energy with 300\n$\\text{fb}^{-1}$ luminosity for a neutral boson decaying into a tau and a muon.\nWe identify parts of the LFV parameter space where the searches for heavy\nscalar and pseudoscalar decaying into a tau and a muon are more sensitive than\nthe similar search for the 125 GeV boson.\n", "  Molecular electronics offers unique scientific and technological\npossibilities, resulting from both the nanometre scale of the devices and their\nreproducible chemical complexity. Two fundamental yet different effects, with\nno classical analogue, have been demonstrated experimentally in single-molecule\njunctions: quantum interference due to competing electron transport pathways,\nand the Kondo effect due to entanglement from strong electronic interactions.\nHere we unify these phenomena, showing that transport through a spin-degenerate\nmolecule can be either enhanced or blocked by Kondo correlations, depending on\nmolecular structure, contacting geometry and applied gate voltages. An exact\nframework is developed, in terms of which the quantum interference properties\nof interacting molecular junctions can be systematically studied and\nunderstood. We prove that an exact Kondo-mediated conductance node results from\ndestructive interference in exchange-cotunneling. Nonstandard temperature\ndependences and gate-tunable conductance peaks/nodes are demonstrated for\nprototypical molecular junctions, illustrating the intricate interplay of\nquantum effects beyond the single-orbital paradigm.\n", "  Conventional full-waveform inversion (FWI) using the least-squares norm\n($L^2$) as a misfit function is known to suffer from cycle skipping. This\nincreases the risk of computing a local rather than the global minimum of the\nmisfit. In our previous work, we proposed the quadratic Wasserstein metric\n($W_2$) as a new misfit function for FWI. The $W_2$ metric has been proved to\nhave many ideal properties with regards to convexity and insensitivity to\nnoise. When the observed and predicted seismic data are regarded as two density\nfunctions, the quadratic Wasserstein metric corresponds to the optimal cost of\nrearranging one density into the other, where the transportation cost is\nquadratic in distance. The difficulty of transforming seismic signals into\nnonnegative density functions is discussed. Unlike the $L^2$ norm, $W_2$\nmeasures not only amplitude differences, but also global phase shifts, which\nhelps to avoid cycle skipping issues. In this work, we build on our earlier\nmethod to cover more realistic high-resolution applications by embedding the\n$W_2$ technique into the framework of the adjoint-state method and applying it\nto seismic relevant 2D examples: the Camembert, the Marmousi, and the 2004 BP\nmodels. We propose a new way of using the $W_2$ metric trace-by-trace in FWI\nand compare it to global $W_2$ via the solution of the Monge-Amp\\`ere equation.\nWith corresponding adjoint source, the velocity model can be updated using the\nl-BFGS method. Numerical results show the effectiveness of $W_2$ for\nalleviating cycle skipping issues and sensitivity to noise. Both mathematical\ntheory and numerical examples demonstrate that the quadratic Wasserstein metric\nis a good candidate for a misfit function in seismic inversion.\n", "  A conceptual difficulty in formulating the density functional theory of the\nfractional quantum Hall effect is that while in the standard approach the\nKohn-Sham orbitals are either fully occupied or unoccupied, the physics of the\nfractional quantum Hall effect calls for fractionally occupied Kohn-Sham\norbitals. This has necessitated averaging over an ensemble of Slater\ndeterminants to obtain meaningful results. We develop an alternative approach\nin which we express and minimize the grand canonical potential in terms of the\ncomposite fermion variables. This provides a natural resolution of the\nfractional-occupation problem because the fully occupied orbitals of composite\nfermions automatically correspond to fractionally occupied orbitals of\nelectrons. We demonstrate the quantitative validity of our approach by\nevaluating the density profile of fractional Hall edge as a function of\ntemperature and the distance from the delta dopant layer and showing that it\nreproduces edge reconstruction in the expected parameter region.\n", "  In a previous article, we have argued that Low's sub-leading soft photon\ntheorem can be recovered as a Ward identity associated to the same large gauge\ntransformations that control the leading piece of the theorem. The key for that\nwas to link the energy expansion displayed in the soft theorem to a\n$\\frac{1}{r}$ expansion that we can perform in the associated asymptotic\ncharge. We expect this idea to be valid in general, and here we provide\ncompelling evidence for it by showing how the same method works in the case of\nEinstein-Hilbert gravity. More precisely, we are able to derive the three\norders of the tree-level soft graviton theorem simply from the BMS\nsupertranslation charge, known to give rise to the leading soft graviton\ntheorem. In particular, we do not need to invoke superrotations (nor extended\nsuperrotations) at any point of the argument.\n", "  Observations of cosmic infrared background (CIB) radiation exhibit\nsignificant fluctuations on small angular scales. A number of explanations have\nbeen put forth, but there is currently no consensus on the origin of these\nlarge fluctuations. We consider the possibility that small-scale fluctuations\nin matter-antimatter asymmetry could lead to variations in star formation rates\nwhich are responsible for the CIB fluctuations. We show that the recently\nproposed Higgs relaxation leptogenesis mechanism can produce such small-scale\nbaryonic isocurvature perturbations which can explain the observed excess in\nthe CIB fluctuations.\n", "  Machine learning, one of today's most rapidly growing interdisciplinary\nfields, promises an unprecedented perspective for solving intricate quantum\nmany-body problems. Understanding the physical aspects of the representative\nartificial neural-network states is recently becoming highly desirable in the\napplications of machine learning techniques to quantum many-body physics. Here,\nwe study the quantum entanglement properties of neural-network states, with a\nfocus on the restricted-Boltzmann-machine (RBM) architecture. We prove that the\nentanglement of all short-range RBM states satisfies an area law for arbitrary\ndimensions and bipartition geometry. For long-range RBM states we show by using\nan exact construction that such states could exhibit volume-law entanglement,\nimplying a notable capability of RBM in representing efficiently quantum states\nwith massive entanglement. We further examine generic RBM states with random\nweight parameters. We find that their averaged entanglement entropy obeys\nvolume-law scaling and meantime strongly deviates from the Page-entropy of the\ncompletely random pure states. We show that their entanglement spectrum has no\nuniversal part associated with random matrix theory and bears a Poisson-type\nlevel statistics. Using reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that RBM is\ncapable of finding the ground state (with power-law entanglement) of a model\nHamiltonian with long-range interaction. In addition, we show, through a\nconcrete example of the one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological cluster\nstates, that the RBM representation may also be used as a tool to analytically\ncompute the entanglement spectrum. Our results uncover the unparalleled power\nof artificial neural networks in representing quantum many-body states, which\npaves a novel way to bridge computer science based machine learning techniques\nto outstanding quantum condensed matter physics problems.\n", "  The production of high-mass, color-singlet particles in hadron colliders is\nuniversally accompanied by initial state QCD radiation that is predominantly\nsoft with respect to the hard process scale $Q$ and/or collinear with respect\nto the beam axis. At TeV-scale colliders, this is in contrast to top quark and\nmultijet processes, which, by definition, are hard and central. Consequently,\nvetoing events with jets possessing transverse momenta above $p_T^{\\rm Veto}$\nin searches for new color-singlet states can efficiently reduce non-singlet\nbackgrounds, thereby increasing experimental sensitivity. To quantify this\ngeneric observation, we investigate the production and leptonic decay of a\nSequential Standard Model $W'$ boson at the 13 TeV LHC. We systematically\nconsider signal and background processes at next-to-leading-order (NLO) in QCD\nwith parton shower (PS) matching; for color-singlet channels, we resum Sudakov\nlogarithms of the form $\\alpha_s^j(p_T^{\\rm Veto})\\log^k(Q/p_T^{\\rm Veto})$ up\nto next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NNLL) with NLO matching. We\nobtain our results using the MadGraph5aMC@NLO and MadGraph5aMC@NLO-SCET\nframeworks, respectively. Associated FeynRules model files capable of handling\nNLO+PS- and NLO+NNLL-accurate computations are publicly available. We find that\nwithin their given uncertainties, both the NLO+PS and NLO+NNLL(veto)\ncalculations give accurate and consistent predictions. Consequently, jet vetoes\napplied to color-singlet processes can be reliably modeled at the NLO+PS level.\nWith respect to a $b$-jet veto of $p_{T}^{\\rm Veto} = 30$ GeV, flavor-agnostic\nvetoes of $p_{T}^{\\rm Veto} = 30-40$ GeV can further reduce single top and\n$t\\overline{t}$ rates by a factor of 2-50 at a mild cost of the signal rate.\nJet vetoes can increase signal-to-noise ratios by roughly 10\\% for light $W'$\nboson masses of 30-50 GeV and 25\\%-250\\% for masses of 300-800 GeV.\n", "  We study the multipartite entanglement of a quantum many-body system\nundergoing a quantum quench. We quantify multipartite entanglement through the\nquantum Fisher information (QFI) density and we are able to express it after a\nquench in terms of a generalized response function. For pure state initial\nconditions and in the thermodynamic limit, we can express the QFI as the\nfluctuations of an observable computed in the so-called diagonal ensemble. We\napply the formalism to the dynamics of a quantum Ising chain after a quench in\nthe transverse field. In this model the asymptotic state is, in almost all\ncases, more than two-partite entangled. Moreover, starting from the\nferromagnetic phase, we find a divergence of multipartite entanglement for\nsmall quenches closely connected to a corresponding divergence of the\ncorrelation length.\n", "  We study the effects of acceleration on fermionic Gaussian states of\nlocalized modes of a Dirac field. We consider two wave-packets in a Gaussian\nstate and transform these to an accelerated frame of reference. In particular,\nwe formulate the action of this transformation as a fermionic quantum channel.\nHaving developed the general framework for fermions, we then investigate the\nentanglement of the vacuum, as well as the entanglement in Bell states. We find\nthat with increasing acceleration vacuum entanglement increases, while the\nentanglement of Bell states decreases. Notably, our results have an immediate\noperational meaning given the localization of the modes.\n", "  We demonstrate simultaneous control of both the phase and amplitude of light\nusing a conjugate gradient minimisation-based hologram calculation technique\nand a single phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM). A cost function which\nincorporates the inner product of the light field with a chosen target field\nwithin a defined measure region is efficiently minimised to create high\nfidelity patterns in the Fourier plane of the SLM. A fidelity of $F=0.999997$\nis achieved for a pattern resembling an $LG^{0}_{1}$ mode with a calculated\nlight-usage efficiency of $41.5\\%$. Possible applications of our method in\noptical trapping and ultracold atoms are presented and we show uncorrected\nexperimental realisation of our patterns with $F = 0.97$ and $7.8\\%$ light\nefficiency.\n", "  To cope with the High Luminosity LHC harsh conditions, the ATLAS inner\ntracker has to be upgraded to meet requirements in terms of radiation hardness,\npile up and geometrical acceptance. The active edge technology allows to reduce\nthe insensitive area at the border of the sensor thanks to an ion etched trench\nwhich avoids the crystal damage produced by the standard mechanical dicing\nprocess. Thin planar n-on-p pixel sensors with active edge have been designed\nand produced by LPNHE and FBK foundry. Two detector module prototypes,\nconsisting of pixel sensors connected to FE-I4B readout chips, have been tested\nwith beams at CERN and DESY. In this paper the performance of these modules are\nreported. In particular the lateral extension of the detection volume, beyond\nthe pixel region, is investigated and the results show high hit-efficiency also\nat the detector edge, even in presence of guard rings.\n", "  Innovation is a key ingredient for the evolution of several systems,\nincluding social and biological ones. Focused investigations and lateral\nthinking may lead to innovation, as well as serendipity and other random\ndiscovery processes. Some individuals are talented at proposing innovation (say\ninnovators), while others at deeply exploring proposed novelties, at getting\nfurther insights on a theory, or at developing products, services, and so on\n(say developers). This separation in terms of innovators and developers raises\nan issue of paramount importance: under which conditions a system is able to\nmaintain innovators? According to a simple model, this work investigates the\nevolutionary dynamics that characterize the emergence of innovation. In\nparticular, we consider a population of innovators and developers, in which\nagents form small groups whose composition is crucial for their payoff. The\nlatter depends on the heterogeneity of the formed groups, on the amount of\ninnovators they include, and on an award-factor that represents the policy of\nthe system for promoting innovation. Under the hypothesis that a \"mobility\"\neffect may support the emergence of innovation, we compare the equilibria\nreached by our population in different cases. Results confirm the beneficial\nrole of \"mobility\", and the emergence of further interesting phenomena.\n", "  We demonstrate a method for probing interaction effects in a thermal beam of\nstrontium atoms using simultaneous measurements of Rydberg EIT and\nspontaneously created ions or electrons. We present a Doppler-averaged optical\nBloch equation model that reproduces the optical signals and allows us to\nconnect the optical coherences and the populations. We use this to determine\nthat the spontaneous ionization process in our system occurs due to collisions\nbetween Rydberg and ground state atoms in the EIT regime. We measure the cross\nsection of this process to be 0.6 $\\pm$ 0.2 $\\sigma_{\\rm{geo}}$, where\n$\\sigma_{\\rm{geo}}$ is the geometrical cross section of the Rydberg atom. This\nresults adds complementary insight to a range of recent studies of interacting\nthermal Rydberg ensembles.\n", "  We propose a Hamiltonian dynamics formalism for the current and magnetic\nfield driven dynamics of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domain walls in\none dimensional systems. To demonstrate the power of this formalism, we derive\nHamilton equations of motion via Poisson brackets based on the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenology, and add dissipative dynamics via the\nevolution of the energy. We use this approach to study current induced domain\nwall motion and compute the drift velocity. For the antiferromagnetic case, we\nshow that a nonzero magnetic moment is induced in the domain wall, which\nindicates that an additional application of a magnetic field would influence\nthe antiferromagnetic domain-wall dynamics. We consider both cases of the\nmagnetic field being parallel and transverse to the N{\\'e}el field. Based on\nthis formalism, we predict an orientation switch mechanism for\nantiferromagnetic domain walls which can be tested with the recently discovered\nN{\\'e}el spin orbit torques.\n", "  We develop a theoretical description of the critical zipping dynamics of a\nself-folding polymer. We use tension propagation theory and the formalism of\nthe generalized Langevin equation applied to a polymer that contains two\ncomplementary parts which can bind to each other. At the critical temperature,\nthe (un)zipping is unbiased and the two strands open and close as a zipper. The\nnumber of closed base pairs $n(t)$ displays a subdiffusive motion characterized\nby a variance growing as $\\langle \\Delta n^2(t) \\rangle \\sim t^\\alpha$ with\n$\\alpha < 1$ at long times. Our theory provides an estimate of both the\nasymptotic anomalous exponent $\\alpha$ and of the subleading correction term,\nwhich are both in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. The results\nindicate that the tension propagation theory captures the relevant features of\nthe dynamics and shed some new insights on related polymer problems\ncharacterized by anomalous dynamical behavior.\n", "  The Higgs boson is unified with gauge fields in the gauge-Higgs unification.\nThe $SO(5) \\times U(1)$ gauge-Higgs electroweak unification in the\nRandall-Sundrum warped space yields almost the same phenomenology at low\nenergies as the standard model, and gives many predictions for the Higgs\ncouplings and new $W', Z'$ bosons around $6 \\sim 8$ TeV, which can be tested at\n14 TeV LHC. The gauge-Higgs grand unification is achieved in $SO(11)$ gauge\ntheory. It suggests the existence of the sixth dimension (GUT dimension) in\naddition to the fifth dimension (electroweak dimension). The proton decay is\nnaturally suppressed in the gauge-Higgs grand unification.\n", "  In the standard model of non-linear structure formation, a cosmic web of\ndark-matter dominated filaments connects dark matter halos. In this paper, we\nstack the weak lensing signal of an ensemble of filaments between groups and\nclusters of galaxies. Specifically, we detect the weak lensing signal, using\nCFHTLenS galaxy ellipticities, from stacked filaments between SDSS-III/BOSS\nluminous red galaxies (LRGs). As a control, we compare the physical LRG pairs\nwith projected LRG pairs that are more widely separated in redshift space. We\ndetect the excess filament mass density in the projected pairs at the $5\\sigma$\nlevel, finding a mass of $(1.6 \\pm 0.3) \\times 10^{13} M_{\\odot}$ for a stacked\nfilament region 7.1 $h^{-1}$ Mpc long and 2.5 $h^{-1}$ Mpc wide. This filament\nsignal is compared with a model based on the three-point\ngalaxy-galaxy-convergence correlation function, as developed in Clampitt, Jain\n& Takada (2014), yielding reasonable agreement.\n", "  Recent time-resolved spectroscopic experiments have indicated that vibronic\ncoupling plays a vital role in facilitating the process of singlet fission. In\nthis work, which forms the first article of a series, we set out to unravel the\nmechanisms underlying singlet fission through a vibronic exciton theory. We\nformulate a model in which both electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom\nare treated microscopically and non-perturbatively. Using pentacene as a\nprototypical material for singlet fission, we subject our theory to comparison\nwith measurements on polarization-resolved absorption of single crystals, and\nemploy our model to characterize the excited states underlying the absorption\nband. Special attention is given to convergence of photophysical observables\nwith respect to the basis size employed, through which we determine the optimal\nbasis for more expensive calculations to be presented in subsequent work. We\nfurthermore evaluate the energetic separation between the optically prepared\nsinglet excited state and the correlated triplet pair state, as well as provide\na real-space characterization of the latter, both of which are of key\nimportance in the discussion of fission dynamics. We discuss our results in the\ncontext of recent experimental studies.\n", "  Singlet fission, the molecular process through which photons are effectively\nconverted into pairs of lower energy triplet excitons, holds promise as a means\nof boosting photovoltaic device efficiencies. In the preceding article of this\nseries, we formulated a vibronic theory of singlet fission, inspired by\nprevious experimental and theoretical studies suggesting that vibronic coupling\nplays an important role in fission dynamics. Here, we extend our model in order\nto simulate two-dimensional electronic spectra, through which the theory is\nfurther validated based on a comparison to recent measurements on pentacene\ncrystals. Moreover, by means of such spectral simulations, we provide new\ninsights into the nature of the correlated triplet pair state, the first\nproduct intermediate in the fission process. In particular, we address a\ndisagreement in the literature regarding the identification, energies, and\ntransition dipole moments of its optical transitions towards higher-lying\ntriplet states.\n", "  We investigate properties of black hole (BH) binaries formed in globular\nclusters via dynamical processes, using direct N-body simulations. We pay\nattention to effects of BH mass function on the total mass and mass ratio\ndistributions of BH binaries ejected from clusters. Firstly, we consider BH\npopulations with two different masses in order to learn basic differences from\nmodels with single-mass BHs only. Secondly, we consider continuous BH mass\nfunctions adapted from recent studies on massive star evolution in a low\nmetallicity environment, where globular clusters are formed. In this work, we\nconsider only binaries that are formed by three-body processes and ignore\nstellar evolution and primordial binaries for simplicity. Our results imply\nthat most BH binary mergers take place after they get ejected from the cluster.\nAlso, mass ratios of dynamically formed binaries should be close to one or\nlikely to be less than 2:1. Since the binary formation efficiency is larger for\nhigher-mass BHs, it is likely that a BH mass function sampled by\ngravitational-wave observations would be weighed toward higher masses than the\nmass function of single BHs for a dynamically formed population. Applying\nconservative assumptions regarding globular cluster populations such as small\nBH mass fraction and no primordial binaries, the merger rate of BH binaries\noriginated from globular clusters is estimated to be at least 6.5 per yr per\nGpc^3. Actual rate can be up to more than several times of our conservative\nestimate.\n", "  We unite the one-flow-dominated-state (OFDS) argument of\n\\citet{MeyrandGaltierPRL12} with the one-chiral-sector-dominated-state (OCSCS)\none \\citep[][]{hydrochirality} to form a nonlinear\nextended-magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) theory for the solar wind turbulence\n(SWT), \\textbf{ranging from the MHD- to subproton-, and even to\nsubelectron-scale regimes} \\citep[modifying the theory\nof][]{AbdelhamidLingamMahajanAPJ16}. Degenerate chiral states in\n\\citet{MiloshevichLingamMorrisonNJP17}'s XMHD absolute equilibria are exposed\nwith helical representation, to offer the basis of replacing the linear wave\n(of infinitesimal or arbitrarily finite amplitudes) arguments of previous\ntheories with OCSDS. Possible connection of the OFDS-plus-OCSDS theory with the\nlocal minimal-energy/stability principle is also discussed.\n", "  We report on the first comparison of distant caesium fountain primary\nfrequency standards (PFSs) via an optical fiber link. The 1415 km long optical\nlink connects two PFSs at LNE-SYRTE (Laboratoire National de m\\'{e}trologie et\nd'Essais - SYst\\`{e}me de R\\'{e}f\\'{e}rences Temps-Espace) in Paris (France)\nwith two at PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt) in Braunschweig\n(Germany). For a long time, these PFSs have been major contributors to accuracy\nof the International Atomic Time (TAI), with stated accuracies of around\n$3\\times 10^{-16}$. They have also been the references for a number of absolute\nmeasurements of clock transition frequencies in various optical frequency\nstandards in view of a future redefinition of the second. The phase coherent\noptical frequency transfer via a stabilized telecom fiber link enables far\nbetter resolution than any other means of frequency transfer based on satellite\nlinks. The agreement for each pair of distant fountains compared is well within\nthe combined uncertainty of a few 10$^{-16}$ for all the comparisons, which\nfully supports the stated PFSs' uncertainties. The comparison also includes a\nrubidium fountain frequency standard participating in the steering of TAI and\nenables a new absolute determination of the $^{87}$Rb ground state hyperfine\ntransition frequency with an uncertainty of $3.1\\times 10^{-16}$.\n  This paper is dedicated to the memory of Andr\\'{e} Clairon, who passed away\non the 24$^{th}$ of December 2015, for his pioneering and long-lasting efforts\nin atomic fountains. He also pioneered optical links from as early as 1997.\n", "  Quantum wells constitute one of the most important classes of devices in the\nstudy of 2D systems. In a double layer QW, the additional \"which-layer\" degree\nof freedom gives rise to celebrated phenomena such as Coulomb drag, Hall drag\nand exciton condensation. Here we demonstrate facile formation of wide QWs in\nfew-layer black phosphorus devices that host double layers of charge carriers.\nIn contrast to tradition QWs, each 2D layer is ambipolar, and can be tuned into\nn-doped, p-doped or intrinsic regimes. Fully spin-polarized quantum Hall states\nare observed on each layer, with enhanced Lande g-factor that is attributed to\nexchange interactions. Our work opens the door for using 2D semiconductors as\nambipolar single, double or wide QWs with unusual properties such as high\nanisotropy.\n", "  Using local central Yukawa-type Malfliet-Tjon interactions reproducing the\nlow-energy parameters and phase shifs of the $nn$ system and the latest updates\nof the $n\\Lambda$ and $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ Nijmegen ESC08c potentials we study the\npossible existence of a ${}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}^{\\,\\,\\,\\,4}n$ bound state. Our\nresults indicate that the ${}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}^{\\,\\,\\,\\,4}n$ is unbound, being\njust above threshold. We discuss the role played by the $^1S_0$ $nn$ repulsive\nterm of the Yukawa-type Malfliet-Tjon interaction.\n", "  A rigid body, with an interior cavity entirely filled with a Navier-Stokes\nliquid, moves in absence of external torques relative to the center of mass of\nthe coupled system body-liquid (inertial motions). The only steady-state\nmotions allowed are then those where the system, as a whole rigid body, rotates\nuniformly around one of the central axes of inertia (permanent rotations).\nObjective of this article is two-fold. On the one hand, we provide sufficient\nconditions for the asymptotic, exponential stability of permanent rotations, as\nwell as for their instability. On the other hand, we study the asymptotic\nbehavior of the generic motion in the class of weak solutions and show that\nthere exists a time $t_0$ after that all such solutions must decay\nexponentially fast to a permanent rotation. This result provides a {\\em full}\nand rigorous explanation of Zhukovsky's conjecture, and explains, likewise,\nother interesting phenomena that are observed in both lab and numerical\nexperiments.\n", "  The higher the energy of a particle is above equilibrium the faster it\nrelaxes due to the growing phase-space of available electronic states it can\ninteract with. In the relaxation process phase coherence is lost, thus limiting\nhigh energy quantum control and manipulation. In one-dimensional systems high\nrelaxation rates are expected to destabilize electronic quasiparticles. We show\nhere that the decoherence induced by relaxation of hot electrons in\none-dimensional semiconducting nanowires evolves non-monotonically with energy\nsuch that above a certain threshold hot-electrons regain stability with\nincreasing energy. We directly observe this phenomenon by visualizing for the\nfirst time the interference patterns of the quasi-one-dimensional electrons\nusing scanning tunneling microscopy. We visualize both the phase coherence\nlength of the one-dimensional electrons, as well as their phase coherence time,\ncaptured by crystallographic Fabry-Perot resonators. A remarkable agreement\nwith a theoretical model reveals that the non-monotonic behavior is driven by\nthe unique manner in which one dimensional hot-electrons interact with the cold\nelectrons occupying the Fermi-sea. This newly discovered relaxation profile\nsuggests a high-energy regime for operating quantum applications that\nnecessitate extended coherence or long thermalization times, and may stabilize\nelectronic quasiparticles in one dimension.\n", "  We have performed a systematic high-momentum-resolution photoemission study\non ZrTe$_5$ using $6$ eV photon energy. We have measured the band structure\nnear the $\\Gamma$ point, and quantified the gap between the conduction and\nvalence band as $18 \\leq \\Delta \\leq 29$ meV. We have also observed\nphoton-energy-dependent behavior attributed to final-state effects and the 3D\nnature of the material's band structure. Our interpretation indicates the gap\nis intrinsic and reconciles discrepancies on the existence of a topological\nsurface state reported by different studies. The existence of a gap suggests\nthat ZrTe$_5$ is not a 3D strong topological insulator nor a 3D Dirac\nsemimetal. Therefore, our experiment is consistent with ZrTe$_5$ being a 3D\nweak topological insulator.\n", "  The quenching of the experimental spectroscopic factor for proton emission\nfrom the short-lived $d_{3/2}$ isomeric state in $^{151m}$Lu was a\nlong-standing problem. In the present work, proton emission from this isomer\nhas been reinvestigated in an experiment at the Accelerator Laboratory of the\nUniversity of Jyv\\\"{a}skyl\\\"{a}. The proton-decay energy and half-life of this\nisomer were measured to be 1295(5) keV and 15.4(8) $\\mu$s, respectively, in\nagreement with another recent study. These new experimental data can resolve\nthe discrepancy in the spectroscopic factor calculated using the spherical WKB\napproximation. Using the R-matrix approach it is found that the proton\nformation probability indicates no significant hindrance for the proton decay\nof $^{151m}$Lu.\n", "  We consider an elastic composite material containing particulate inclusions\nin a soft elastic matrix that is bounded by a rigid wall, e.g., the substrate.\nIf such a composite serves as a soft actuator, forces are imposed on or induced\nbetween the embedded particles. We investigate how the presence of the rigid\nwall affects the interactions between the inclusions in the elastic matrix. For\nno-slip boundary conditions, we transfer Blake's derivation of a corresponding\nGreen's function from low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics to the linearly elastic\ncase. Results for no-slip and free-slip surface conditions are compared to each\nother and to the bulk behavior. Our results suggest that walls with free-slip\nsurface conditions are preferred when they serve as substrates for soft\nactuators made from elastic composite materials. As we further demonstrate, the\npresence of a rigid wall can qualitatively change the interactions between the\ninclusions. In effect, it can switch attractive interactions into repulsive\nones (and vice versa). It should be straightforward to observe the effects in\nfuture experiments and to combine our results, e.g., with the modeling of\nbiological cells and tissue on rigid surfaces.\n", "  We compare the results of the semi-classical (SC) and quantum-mechanical (QM)\nformalisms for angular-momentum changing transitions in Rydberg atom collisions\ngiven by Vrinceanu & Flannery, J. Phys. B 34, L1 (2001), and Vrinceanu, Onofrio\n& Sadeghpour, ApJ 747, 56 (2012), with those of the SC formalism using a\nmodified Monte Carlo realization. We find that this revised SC formalism agrees\nwell with the QM results. This provides further evidence that the rates derived\nfrom the QM treatment are appropriate to be used when modelling recombination\nthrough Rydberg cascades, an important process in understanding the state of\nmaterial in the early universe. The rates for $\\Delta\\ell=\\pm1$ derived from\nthe QM formalism diverge when integrated to sufficiently large impact\nparameter, $b$. Further to the empirical limits to the $b$ integration\nsuggested by Pengelly & Seaton, MNRAS 127, 165 (1964), we suggest that the\nfundamental issue causing this divergence in the theory is that it does not\nfully cater for the finite time taken for such distant collisions to complete.\n", "  Besides the defining space-time symmetries (homogeneity and isotropy) of\ninertial frames, the derivation of Lorentz transformation requires postulating\nthe principle of relativity and the existence of a finite speed limit. In this\narticle, we point out that the existence of a finite speed limit can be readily\ninferred from the nature of allowed inertial frames. We also show that the\nprinciple of relativity can be obtained from the defining space-time symmetries\nof every inertial frame. Therefore, if the conventional definition of inertial\nframes is augmented properly, the special theory of relativity (Lorentz\ntransformation) would follow from the definition of inertial frames.\n", "  We consider methods for improving the estimation of constraints on a\nhigh-dimensional parameter space with a computationally expensive likelihood\nfunction. In such cases Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can take a long time to\nconverge and concentrates on finding the maxima rather than the often-desired\nconfidence contours for accurate error estimation. We employ DALE$\\chi$ (Direct\nAnalysis of Limits via the Exterior of $\\chi^2$) for determining confidence\ncontours by minimizing a cost function parametrized to incentivize points in\nparameter space which are both on the confidence limit and far from previously\nsampled points. We compare DALE$\\chi$ to the nested sampling algorithm\nimplemented in MultiNest on a toy likelihood function that is highly\nnon-Gaussian and non-linear in the mapping between parameter values and\n$\\chi^2$. We find that in high-dimensional cases DALE$\\chi$ finds the same\nconfidence limit as MultiNest using roughly an order of magnitude fewer\nevaluations of the likelihood function. DALE$\\chi$ is open-source and available\nat https://github.com/danielsf/Dalex.git.\n", "  Gamma radiation associated with radon decay exhibits variations in both time\nof year and time of day. The annual oscillation has its maximum value in June,\nsuggestive of a galactic influence. Measurements made at midnight show strong\nevidence of an influence of solar rotation, but measurements made at noon do\nnot. We find several pairs of oscillations with frequencies separated by 1\ncycle per year that is suggestive of an influence of rotation that is oblique\nwith respect to the normal to the ecliptic. We suggest that beta decays may be\nstimulated by neutrinos and that the decay products tend to travel in the same\ndirection as the neutrinos. We estimate the relevant cross section.\n", "  We analyze an exhaustive data-set of new-cars monthly sales. The set refers\nto 10 years of Spanish sales of more than 6500 different car model\nconfigurations and a total of 10M sold cars, from January 2007 to January 2017.\nWe find that for those model configurations with a monthly market-share higher\nthan 0.1% the sales become scalable obeying Gibrat's law of proportional growth\nunder logistic dynamics. Remarkably, the distribution of total sales follows\nthe predictions of the Maximum Entropy Principle for systems subject to\nproportional growth in dynamical equilibrium. We also encounter that the\nassociated dynamics are non-Markovian, i.e., the system has a decaying memory\nor inertia of about 5 years. Thus, car sales are predictable within a certain\ntime-period. We show that the main characteristics of the dynamics can be\ndescribed via a construct based upon the Langevin equation. This construct\nencompasses the fundamental principles that any predictive model on car sales\nshould obey.\n", "  Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), the most stable member of vanadium oxide family,\nexhibits interesting semiconductor to metal transition in the temperature range\nof 530-560 K. The metallic behavior originates because of the reduction of V2O5\nthrough oxygen vacancies. In the present report, V2O5 nanorods in the\northorhombic phase with crystal orientation of (001) are grown using vapor\ntransport process. Among three nonequivalent oxygen atoms in a VO5 pyramidal\nformula unit in V2O5 structure, the role of terminal vanadyl oxygen (OI) in the\nformation of metallic phase above the transition temperature is established\nfrom the temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopic studies. The origin of the\nmetallic behavior of V2O5 is also understood due to the breakdown of pdpi bond\nbetween OI and nearest V atom instigated by the formation of vanadyl OI\nvacancy, confirmed from the downward shift of the bottom most split-off\nconduction bands in the material with increasing temperature.\n", "  Dark matter (DM) and neutrinos are the two most compelling pieces of evidence\nof new physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics but these are\noften treated as belonging to two different sectors. Yet DM-neutrino\ninteractions are known to have cosmological consequences. Here, we study the\nscenario of a scalar DM candidate coupled to left-handed neutrinos via a Dirac\nmediator. We determine the mass of a DM candidate that yields the right DM\nrelic abundance in a thermal scenario and it is consistent with large-scale\nstructure formation. In order to satisfy both constraints, a complex DM\ncandidate should have a mass larger than $8.14$ keV while the mass of a real DM\ncandidate should be above $18.1$ eV, independently of the value of the\nDM-neutrino coupling.\n", "  Any form of dark matter which was in thermal equilibrium with the Standard\nModel in the early Universe must have some annihilation mechanism in order to\navoid overclosure. In general, such models are now constrained by the negative\nexperimental results from colliders, direct detection, and indirect detection,\nall of which are capable of probing interactions at the approximate strength\nsuggested by a thermal cross section. It is timely to consider what scenarios\nof thermal dark matter which are still viable. In this paper we consider a\nclass of dark matter models which is designed to avoid many of the current\nconstraints: Majorana dark matter coupling to the Standard Model through\nleptophilic singlet scalars and pseudoscalars. We show that requiring realistic\nelectroweak symmetry breaking generically forces the mediators to couple with\nquarks, allowing these models to be constrained by the current experimental\ndata. We find that -- barring fine-tuning -- this type of thermal dark matter\nis excluded by a combination of direct and indirect detection for masses below\n$\\sim 100$ GeV. Heavier dark matter is still viable, but in principle visible\nvia its indirect detection signature.\n", "  The study of neutrinoless double-beta decay plays a fundamental role in the\nunderstanding of neutrino physics. Its observation would prove that neutrinos\nare Majorana particles and that lepton number is not conserved. Experimental\nsearches demand detectors with a very large source mass and extremely low\nbackground. We report on planned future experimental searches and discuss their\nexpected sensitivities.\n", "  We present a lattice Monte Carlo algorithm based on the one originally\nproposed by Maggs and Rossetto for simulating electrostatic interactions in\ninhomogeneous dielectric media. The original algorithm is known to produce\nattractive interactions between particles of the same dielectric constant in\nthe medium of different dielectric constant. We demonstrate that such\ninteractions are spurious, caused by incorrectly biased statistical weight\narising from particle motion during the Monte Carlo moves. We propose a simple\nparallel tempering algorithm that corrects this unphysical bias. The efficacy\nof our algorithm is tested on a simple binary mixture and on an uncharged\npolymer in a solvent, and applied to salt-doped polymer solutions.\n", "  The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) has revealed many TeV (10 12\neV) gamma-ray sources along the Galactic Plane and around 30 percent of these\nsources remain unidentified. The morphology and dynamics of dense gas\ncoincident and surrounding the gamma-ray emission can provide clues about the\nnature of the TeV emission. The H2O Southern Galactic Plane Survey (HOPS)\nundertaken with the Mopra radio telescope, includes several dense gas tracers,\nsuch as NH3 (n,n) transitions and HC3N (3-2), star formation tracers including\nH2O masers, and radio recombination lines which trace ionised gas. A search for\ndense gas, traced by NH3 (1,1) emission seen in HOPS and additional\nobservations, towards Galactic TeV sources has been undertaken. Of the 49\nGalactic TeV sources covered by 12 mm observations, NH3 (1,1) is detected\ntowards or adjacent to 38 of them. Dense gas counterparts have been detected\nnear several unidentified Galactic TeV sources which display morphology\npointing to a hadronic origin to the TeV gamma-rays. The dense gas detected\ntowards some TeV sources displays unusual emission characteristics, including\nvery broad linewidths and enhanced ortho-to-para NH3 abundance ratios towards\nHESS J1745-303 and HESS J1801-233, which reflects previous shock activity\nwithin the gas.\n", "  Our group has recently developed a finite element model of a\nnanoparticle-mediated optical breakdown phenomena. Previously, this model was\nused to analyze the role of the nanoparticle morphology and the wavelength\ndependence of a nanoparticle-mediated optical breakdown threshold during\nnear-infrared ps and fs pulse exposures. In this study, we provide a\ntheoretical insight into the optoporation efficiency of live cells and bubble\nformation threshold during nanoparticle-mediated optical breakdown. It was done\nby the calculation of maximum temperature and free electron density in the\nvicinity of a single gold nanoshell in water during 70 femtosecond single pulse\nexposure and comparison against published experimental data.\n", "  A fully reconfigurable two-dimensional (2D) rocking ratchet system created\nwith holographic optical micromanipulation is presented. We can generate\noptical potentials with the geometry of any Bravais lattice in 2D and introduce\na spatial asymmetry with arbitrary orientation. Nontrivial directed transport\nof Brownian particles along different directions is demonstrated numerically\nand experimentally, including on-axis, perpendicular and oblique with respect\nto an unbiased ac driving. The most important aspect to define the current\ndirection is shown to be the asymmetry and not the driving orientation, and yet\nwe show a system in which the asymmetry orientation of each potential well does\nnot coincide with the transport direction, suggesting an additional symmetry\nbreaking as a result of a coupling with the lattice configuration. Our\nexperimental device, due to its versatility, opens up a new range of\npossibilities in the study of nonequilibrium dynamics at the microscopic level.\n", "  VO2 samples are grown with different oxygen concentrations leading to\ndifferent monoclinic, M1 and triclinic, T insulating phases which undergo a\nfirst order metal to insulator transition (MIT) followed by a structural phase\ntransition (SPT) to rutile tetragonal phase. The metal insulator transition\ntemperature (Tc) was found to be increased with increasing native defects.\nVanadium vacancy (VV) is envisaged to create local strains in the lattice which\nprevents twisting of the V-V dimers promoting metastable monoclinic, M2 and T\nphases at intermediate temperatures. It is argued that MIT is driven by strong\nelectronic correlation. The low temperature insulating phase can be considered\nas a collection of one-dimensional (1-D) half-filled band, which undergoes Mott\ntransition to 1-D infinitely long Heisenberg spin 1/2 chains leading to\nstructural distortion due to spin-phonon coupling. Presence of VV creates\nlocalized holes (d0) in the nearest neighbor, thereby fragmenting the spin 1/2\nchains at nanoscale, which in turn increase the Tc value more than that of an\ninfinitely long one. The Tc value scales inversely with the average size of\nfragmented Heisenberg spin 1/2 chains following a critical exponent of 2/3,\nwhich is exactly the same predicted theoretically for Heisenberg spin 1/2 chain\nat nanoscale undergoing SPT (spin-Peierls transition). Thus, the observation of\nMIT and SPT at the same time in VO2 can be explained from our phenomenological\nmodel of reduced 1-D Heisenberg spin 1/2 chains. The reported increase\n(decrease) in Tc value of VO2 by doping with metal having valency less (more)\nthan four, can also be understood easily with our unified model, for the first\ntime, considering finite size scaling of Heisenberg chains.\n", "  This paper discusses a recently proposed scenario of a climate-induced\nCollapse of the Eastern Mediterranean in the 11th century AD. It demonstrates\nthat such a scenario cannot be maintained when confronted with proxy data from\nvarious regions. On the other hand, data on the interplay between environment\nand economy in the Komnenian period (1081-1185) and evidence for a change of\nclimatic conditions in the period of the Angeloi (1185-1204) is presented,\narguing that climatic parameters should be taken into consideration when\ncomparing socio-economic dynamics in the Eastern Mediterranean with those in\nWestern Europe. The necessity of further research on the regional as well as\nover-regional level for many aspects of the interaction between human society\nand environment in the medieval Eastern Mediterranean is highlighted.\n", "  We explore the structural, electronic, mechanical and thermoelectric\nproperties of a new half Heusler compound, HfPtPb which is all metallic heavy\nelement and has been recently been proposed to be stable [Nature Chem 7 (2015)\n308]. In the present work, we employ density functional theory and\nsemiclassical Boltzmann transport equations with constant relaxation time\napproximation. The mechanical properties such as Shear modulus, Young modulus,\nelastic constants, Poisson ratio, and shear anisotropy factor are investigated.\nThe elastic and phonon properties reveal that this compound is mechanically and\ndynamically stable. Pugh and Frantsevich ratio demonstrates the ductile\nbehavior and Shear anisotropic factor reflects the anisotropic nature of\nHfPtPb. The calculation of band structure predicts that this compound is\nsemiconductor in nature with band gap 0.86 eV. The thermoelectric transport\nparameters such as Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and electronic\nthermal conductivity and lattice thermal conductivity have been calculated as a\nfunction of temperature. The highest value of Seebeck coefficient is obtained\nfor n-type doping at optimal carrier concentration. We predict the maximum\nvalue of the figure of merit 0.25 at 1000 K. Our investigation suggests that\nthis material is n-type semiconductor.\n", "  The dynamics of the general Bianchi IX spacetime, near the gravitational\nsingularity, underlies the Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz scenario.\nAsymptotically, near the singularity, the oscillations of the directional scale\nfactors (defining the spacetime metric) are freezed so the evolution of the\nBianchi IX model is devoid of chaotic features. However, it includes special\nstructures, that we call the wiggles, which change their properties in the\nasymptotic regime. We propose the formalism, based on an affine quantization\nscheme, to examine the fate of the wiggles at the quantum level. We present the\nway of comparing the classical wiggles with their quantum counterparts. We\nexpect that our work may contribute towards understanding some quantum aspects\nof the BKL scenario.\n", "  It is shown that a channel flow of a dilute polymer solution between two\nwidely spaced cylinders hindering the flow is an important paradigm of an\nunbounded flow in the case in which the channel wall is located sufficiently\nfar from the cylinders. The quantitative characterization of instabilities in a\ncreeping viscoelastic channel flow between two widely spaced cylinders reveals\ntwo elastically driven transitions, which are associated with the breaking of\ntime-reversal and mirror symmetries: Hopf and forward bifurcations described by\ntwo order parameters $\\mbox{v}_{rms}$ and $\\bar{\\omega}$, respectively. We\nsuggest that a decrease of the normalized distance between the obstacles leads\nto a collapse of the two bifurcations into a codimension-2 point, a situation\ngeneral for many non-equilibrium systems. However, the striking and unexpected\nresult is the discovery of a mechanism of the vorticity growth via an increase\nof a vortex length at the preserved streamline curvature in a viscoelastic\nflow, which is in sharp contrast to the well-known suppression of the vorticity\nin a Newtonian flow by polymer additives.\n", "  This paper is a continuation of the author's preceding one. In the preceding\npaper the author has rigorously constructed the Feynman path integral for the\nDirac equation in the form of the sum-over-histories, satisfying the\nsuperposition principle, over all paths of one electron in space-time that goes\nin any direction at any speed, forward and backward in time with a finite\nnumber of turns. In the present paper, first we will generalize the results in\nthe preceding paper and secondly prove in a direct way that our Feynman path\nintegral satisfies the unitarity principle and the causality one.\n", "  Polymer models are used to describe chromatin, which can be folded at\ndifferent spatial scales by binding molecules. By folding, chromatin generates\nloops of various sizes. We present here a randomly cross-linked (RCL) polymer\nmodel, where monomer pairs are connected randomly. We obtain asymptotic\nformulas for the steady-state variance, encounter probability, the radius of\ngyration, instantaneous displacement and the mean first encounter time between\nany two monomers. The analytical results are confirmed by Brownian simulations.\nFinally, the present results can be used to extract the minimum number of\ncross-links in a chromatin region from {conformation capture} data.\n", "  Unlike other tissue types, like epithelial tissue, which consist of cells\nwith a much more homogeneous structure and function, the nervous tissue spans\nin a complex multilayer environment whose topographical features display a\nlarge spectrum of morphologies and size scales. Traditional cell cultures,\nwhich are based on two-dimensional cell-adhesive culture dishes or coverslips,\nare lacking topographical cues and mainly simulate the biochemical\nmicroenvironment of the cells. With the emergence of micro- and\nnano-fabrication techniques new types of cell culture platforms are developed,\nwhere the effect of various topographical cues on cellular morphology,\nproliferation and differentiation, can be studied. Different approaches\n(regarding the material, fabrication technique, topographical charactertistics,\netc.) have been implemented. The present review paper aims at reviewing the\nexisting body of literature on the use of artificial micro- and\nnano-topographical features to control neuronal morphology, outgrowth and\nneural network topology. The cell responses from phenomenology to investigation\nof the underlying mechanisms- on the different topographies, including both\ndeterministic and random ones, are summarized.\n", "  Pseudo-one dimensional (pseudo-1D) materials are a new-class of materials\nwhere atoms are arranged in chain like structures in two-dimensions (2D).\nExamples include recently discovered black phosphorus, ReS2 and ReSe2 from\ntransition metal dichalcogenides, TiS3 and ZrS3 from transition metal\ntrichalcogenides and most recently GaTe. The presence of structural anisotropy\nimpacts their physical properties and leads to direction dependent light-matter\ninteractions, dichroic optical responses, high mobility channels, and\nanisotropic thermal conduction. Despite the numerous reports on the vapor phase\ngrowth of isotropic TMDCs and post transition metal chalcogenides such as MoS2\nand GaSe, the synthesis of pseudo-1D materials is particularly difficult due to\nthe anisotropy in interfacial energy, which stabilizes dendritic growth rather\nthan single crystalline growth with well-defined orientation. The growth of\nmonoclinic GaTe has been demonstrated on flexible mica substrates with superior\nphotodetecting performance. In this work, we demonstrate that pseudo-1D\nmonoclinic GaTe layers can be synthesized on a variety of other substrates\nincluding GaAs (111), Si (111) and c-cut sapphire by physical vapor transport\ntechniques. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)\nmeasurements, together with angle resolved micro-PL and micro-Raman techniques,\nprovide for the very first time atomic scale resolution experiments on\npseudo-1D structures in monoclinic GaTe and anisotropic properties.\nInterestingly, GaTe nanomaterials grown on sapphire exhibit highly efficient\nand narrow localized emission peaks below the band gap energy, which are found\nto be related to select types of line and point defects as evidenced by PL and\nRaman mapping scans. It makes the samples grown on sapphire more prominent than\nthose grown on GaAs and Si, which demonstrate more regular properties.\n", "  Nano-mechanical resonators have gained an increasing importance in\nnanotechnology owing to their contributions to both fundamental and applied\nscience. Yet, their small dimensions and mass raises some challenges as their\ndynamics gets dominated by nonlinearities that degrade their performance, for\ninstance in sensing applications. Here, we report on the precise control of the\nnonlinear and stochastic bistable dynamics of a levitated nanoparticle in high\nvacuum. We demonstrate how it can lead to efficient signal amplification\nschemes, including stochastic resonance. This work paves the way for the use of\nlevitated nanoparticles as a model system for stochastic bistable dynamics,\nwith applications to a wide variety of fields.\n", "  Plasticity in zirconium alloys is mainly controlled by the interaction of 1/3\n1210 screw dislocations with oxygen atoms in interstitial octahedral sites of\nthe hexagonal close-packed lattice. This process is studied here using ab\ninitio calculations based on the density functional theory. The atomic\nsimulations show that a strong repulsion exists only when the O atoms lie in\nthe dislocation core and belong to the prismatic dislocation habit plane. This\nis a consequence of the destruction of the octahedral sites by the stacking\nfault arising from the dislocation dissociation. Because of the repulsion, the\ndislocation partially cross-slips to an adjacent prismatic plane, in agreement\nwith experiments where the lattice friction on screw dislocations in Zr-O\nalloys has been attributed to the presence of jogs on the dislocations due to\nlocal cross-slip.\n", "  We study synchronization patterns in repulsively coupled Kuramoto oscillators\nand focus on the impact of disorder in the natural frequencies. Among other\nchoices we select the grid size and topology in a way that we observe a\ndynamically induced dimensional reduction with a continuum of attractors as\nlong as the natural frequencies are uniformly chosen. When we introduce\ndisorder in these frequencies, we find limit cycles with periods that are\norders of magnitude longer than the natural frequencies of individual\noscillators. Moreover we identify sequences of temporary patterns of\nphase-locked motion, which are self-similar in time and whose periods scale\nwith a power of the inverse width about a uniform frequency distribution. This\nbehavior provides challenges for future research.\n", "  Simulation of a sonic black-hole/white-hole pair in a (2+1)-dimensional\nBose-Einstein condensate shows formation of superfluid vortices through\ndynamical instabilities seeded by initial quantum noise. The instabilities\nsaturate in a quasi-steady state of superfluid turbulence within the supersonic\nregion, from which sound waves are emitted in qualitative resemblance to\nHawking radiance. The power spectrum of the radiation from the slowly decaying\ntwo-dimensional sonic black hole is strongly non-thermal, however.\n", "  We apply the spectral element method to the determination of scattering and\nbound states of the multichannel Schr\\\"odinger equation. In our approach the\nreaction coordinate is discretized on a grid of points whereas the internal\ncoordinates are described by either purely diabatic or locally diabatic\n(diabatic-by-sector) bases. Bound levels and scattering matrix elements are\ndetermined with spectral accuracy using relatively small numbers of points. The\nscattering problem is cast as a linear system solved using state-of-the-art\nsparse matrix non iterative packages. Boundary conditions can be imposed so to\ncompute a single column of the matrix solution. A comparison with\nlog-derivative propagators customarily used in molecular physics is performed.\nThe same discretization scheme can also be applied to bound levels that are\ncomputed using direct scalable sparse-matrix solvers.\n", "  We study segregation of a binary mixture of similarly charged particles under\nshear using particle-based simulations. We simulate particle dynamics using a\ndiscrete-element model including electrostatic interactions and find that\nparticles segregate according to their net charge. Particles that are charged\ntwice as strong as other particles of the same electrical sign are seen more at\ninsulating boundaries with which we shear the system. Weakly charged particles,\non the other hand, stay more in the center of the sheared bed. We propose a\nsimple model based on electrostatic potential energy to understand this\nsegregation. The model shows that the segregated system we observe in our\nsimulations is indeed the most favorable configuration in terms of\nelectrostatic potential energy. Our simulations further show that for a given\npacking fraction there is an optimal shear velocity where the segregation\nmaximally intensifies. We show that this maximum results from a competition\nbetween diffusional and Coulomb fluxes. For a larger shear velocity, diffusion\nsuppresses segregation.\n", "  Non-linear sigma models with extended supersymmetry have constrained target\nspace geometries, and can serve as effective tools for investigating and\nconstructing new geometries. Analyzing the geometrical and topological\nproperties of sigma models is necessary to understand the underlying structures\nof string theory. The most general two-dimensional sigma model with manifest\nN=(2,2) supersymmetry can be parametrized by chiral, twisted chiral and\nsemichiral superfields. In the research presented in this thesis, N=(4,4)\n(twisted) supersymmetry is constructed for a semichiral sigma model. It is\nfound that the model can only have additional supersymmetry off-shell if the\ntarget space has a dimension larger than four. For four-dimensional target\nmanifolds, supersymmetry can be introduced on-shell, leading to a hyperk\\\"ahler\nmanifold, or pseudo-supersymmetry can be imposed off-shell, implying a target\nspace which is neutral hyperk\\\"ahler.\n  Different sigma models and corresponding geometries can be related to each\nother by T-duality, obtained by gauging isometries of the Lagrangian. The\nsemichiral vector multiplet and the large vector multiplet are needed for\ngauging isometries mixing semichiral superfields, and chiral and twisted chiral\nsuperfields, respectively. We find transformations that close off-shell to a\nN=(4,4) supersymmetry on the field strengths and gauge potentials of the\nsemichiral vector multiplet, and show that this is not possible for the large\nvector multiplet.\n  A sigma model parametrized by chiral and twisted chiral superfields can be\nrelated to a semichiral sigma model by T-duality. The N=(4,4) supersymmetry\ntransformations of the former model are linear and close off-shell, whereas\nthose of the latter are non-linear and close only on-shell. We show that this\ndiscrepancy can be understood from T-duality, and find the origin of the\nnon-linear terms in the transformations.\n", "  We demonstrate how a class of non-supersymmetric $SO(10)$ GUT with asymmetric\nleft-right theory $SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_R \\times U(1)_{B-L} \\times SU(3)_C$ and\nPati-Salam theory $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R \\times SU(4)_C$ as intermediate\nsymmetry breaking steps leads to successful gauge coupling unification\nsatisfying proton decay constraints. The motivation behind this work is two\nfold: firstly to study the renormalization group evolution equations for gauge\ncouplings by keeping right-handed neutral gauge boson $Z_R$ around LHC energy\nrange leading interesting dilepton searches at collider while fixing charge\npartner of the gauge boson $W_R$ at very high scale; secondly to explain\nneutrino masses and associated lepton number violating process like\nneutrinoless double beta decay in three possible cases depending on how\n$SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_R \\times U(1)_{B-L} \\times SU(3)_C$ breaks down to SM. We\ninclude one extra fermion singlet per generation in order to implement gauged\nextended seesaw where light neutrino mass is governed by natural type-II seesaw\nmechanism whereas type-I seesaw contribution is exactly canceled out. Since\nlight neutrino mass formula is independent of Dirac neutrino mass matrix, the\nvalue of Dirac neutrino mass is taken to be up-type quark mass matrix which is\na characteristics of Pati-Salam symmetry relating quarks with leptons. We\npresent analytic relation for effective Majorana mass parameter and\ncorresponding half-life arising from new physics contributions due to purely\nleft-handed currents through exchange of heavy right-handed neutrinos and\nsterile neutrinos. We numerically estimate effective Majorana mass parameter\nand half-life vs. lightest neutrino mass and derive lower bound on lightest\nneutrino mass by saturating with experimental bounds like GERDA Phase-II,\nKamLANDZen and EXO.\n", "  This paper reports a practical method of generating circularly polarized\nterahertz (THz) waves from intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJs) and controlling\ntheir polarization states by external local heating. We theoretically find that\na mesa-structure IJJ whose geometry is almost square can emit circularly\npolarized THz waves by local heating of the mesa. Moreover, we demonstrate that\nthe polarization states of the THz waves change dramatically with the local\nheating position. Our results indicate that the use of local heating can\nprovide a high level of controllability of the THz emissions and significantly\nextend the range of applications of IJJ-based THz emitters.\n", "  This Comment argues that two assumptions, which are presented as basic\nassumptions of Bell's theorem in [J. Handsteiner et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118,\n060401 (2017)] and elsewhere, in fact follow from more basic premises.\nMeasurement independence follows from (i) the use of free variables and (ii)\nthe causal arrow of time. Determinism follows from (i) local causality and (ii)\nperfect correlations (predicted by quantum mechanics). In particular, it is\npointed out that the measurement-independence violating toy model of [M.J.W.\nHall, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 250404 (2010)], is based on a retro-causal model.\nWhile this may be controversial, it should be possible to achieve concensus on\nthe much simpler matter of what the basic assumptions of Bell's theorem are.\n", "  In this paper we have obtained cosmological models for the static spherically\nsymmetric spacetime with charged anisotropic fluid distribution in\n(n+2)-dimensions in context of Rosen's Bimetric General Relativity (BGR). An\nexact solution is obtained and a special case is considered.\n", "  We argue that the double-slit experiment can be understood much better by\nconsidering it as an experiment whereby one uses electrons to study the set-up\nrather than an experiment whereby we use a set-up to study the behaviour of\nelectrons. We also show how the concept of undecidability can be used in an\nintuitive way to make sense of the double-slit experiment and the quantum rules\nfor calculating coherent and incoherent probabilities. We meet here a situation\nwhere the electrons always behave in a fully deterministic way (following\nEinstein's conception of reality), while the detailed design of the set-up may\nrender the question about the way they move through the set-up experimentally\nundecidable (which follows more Bohr's conception of reality). We show that the\nexpression $\\psi_{1} + \\psi_{2}$ for the wave function of the double-slit\nexperiment is numerically correct, but logically flawed. It has to be replaced\nin the interference region by the logically correct expression $\\psi'_{1} +\n\\psi'_{2}$, which has the same numerical value as $\\psi_{1} + \\psi_{2}$, such\nthat $\\psi'_{1} + \\psi'_{2} = \\psi_{1} + \\psi_{2}$, but with $\\psi'_{1} =\n{\\psi_{1} +\\psi_{2}\\over{\\sqrt{2}}} \\,e^{\\imath {\\pi\\over{4}}} \\neq \\psi_{1}$\nand $\\psi'_{2} = {\\psi_{1} +\\psi_{2}\\over{\\sqrt{2}}}\\,e^{-\\imath\n{\\pi\\over{4}}}\\neq \\psi_{2}$. Here $\\psi'_{1}$ and $\\psi'_{2}$ are the correct\ncontributions from the slits to the total wave function $\\psi'_{1} +\n\\psi'_{2}$. We have then $p = |\\psi'_{1} + \\psi'_{2}|^{2} = |\\psi'_{1}|^{2} +\n|\\psi'_{2}|^{2} = p_{1}+p_{2} $ such that the paradox that quantum mechanics\n(QM) would not follow the traditional rules of probability calculus disappears.\n", "  We present a formalism for which a dissipative system is given by a\nvariational principle. The formalism applies to dynamical systems where its\ntrajectory is monotonic. Subsequently, we derive its Lagrangian and\nHamiltonian. From the Hamiltonian, we quantize canonically the classical\nparticle in a viscous media. We study the free quantum particle in a viscous\nmedia and the dissipative quantum tunnelling. It is found that the dissipation\ninfluences tunnelling probability by a factor that closely resembles the result\nof Caldeira and Leggett.\n", "  We have investigated the dynamics of particles in the vicinity of a static\nspherically symmetric black hole in f(R) gravity. Using the Euler-Lagrange\nmethod the dynamical equations of a neutral particle are obtained. Assuming\nthat the particle is initially moving in the innermost stable circular orbit,\nwe have calculated its escape velocity, after a collision with some other\nparticle. The conditions for the escape of colliding particles are discussed.\nThe effective potential and the trajectories of the escaping particles are\nstudied graphically.\n", "  Physical thermodynamic and kinetic, chemical and biological reasoning\nrestrict the spatial dimensions of living cells and confine them to between one\nand one hundred micrometers. Cells should necessarily be macroscopic,\ndissipative objects, resisting thermal fluctuations and providing sufficient\ninformational capacity. The upper limit of spatial dimensions of cells is\nsupplied by their ability to withstand gravity and inertia forces under\nreasonable deformations. The upper limit of cell dimensions is also governed by\nthe hierarchy of characteristic time scales, inherent for mass and heat\ntransport. For micron-scaled cells, the traffic time (namely a typical time\nnecessary for the migration of one enzyme to another) is on the order of\nmagnitude of a millisecond, which coincides with the characteristic time scale\nof a single round of the catalytic enzyme cycle. Among other important\nconsequences the macroscopic dimensions of living cells seen as dissipative\nsystems) give rise to the irreversibility of biological processes,\ndemonstrating the arrow of time.\n", "  The human brain displays a complex network topology, whose structural\norganization is widely studied using diffusion tensor imaging. The original\ngeometry from which emerges the network topology is known, as well as the\nlocalization of the network nodes in respect to the brain morphology and\nanatomy. One of the most challenging problems of current network science is to\ninfer the latent geometry from the mere topology of a complex network. The\nhuman brain structural connectome represents the perfect benchmark to test\nalgorithms aimed to solve this problem. Coalescent embedding was recently\ndesigned to map a complex network in the hyperbolic space, inferring the node\nangular coordinates. Here we show that this methodology is able to\nunsupervisedly reconstruct the latent geometry of the brain with an incredible\naccuracy and that the intrinsic geometry of the brain networks strongly relates\nto the lobes organization known in neuroanatomy. Furthermore, coalescent\nembedding allowed the detection of geometrical pathological changes in the\nconnectomes of Parkinson's Disease patients. The present study represents the\nfirst evidence of brain networks' angular coalescence in the hyperbolic space,\nopening a completely new perspective, possibly towards the realization of\nlatent geometry network markers for evaluation of brain disorders and\npathologies.\n", "  Hydrogen-rich compounds are important for understanding the dissociation of\ndense molecular hydrogen, as well as searching for room temperature\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors. A recent high pressure\nexperiment reported the successful synthesis of novel insulating lithium\npolyhydrides when above 130 GPa. However, the results are in sharp contrast to\nprevious theoretical prediction by PBE functional that around this pressure\nrange all lithium polyhydrides (LiHn (n = 2-8)) should be metallic. In order to\naddress this discrepancy, we perform unbiased structure search with first\nprinciples calculation by including the van der Waals interaction that was\nignored in previous prediction to predict the high pressure stable structures\nof LiHn (n = 2-11, 13) up to 200 GPa. We reproduce the previously predicted\nstructures, and further find novel compositions that adopt more stable\nstructures. The van der Waals functional (vdW-DF) significantly alters the\nrelative stability of lithium polyhydrides, and predicts that the stable\nstoichiometries for the ground-state should be LiH2 and LiH9 at 130-170 GPa,\nand LiH2, LiH8 and LiH10 at 180-200 GPa. Accurate electronic structure\ncalculation with GW approximation indicates that LiH, LiH2, LiH7, and LiH9 are\ninsulative up to at least 208 GPa, and all other lithium polyhydrides are\nmetallic. The calculated vibron frequencies of these insulating phases are also\nin accordance with the experimental infrared (IR) data. This reconciliation\nwith the experimental observation suggests that LiH2, LiH7, and LiH9 are the\npossible candidates for lithium polyhydrides synthesized in that experiment.\nOur results reinstate the credibility of density functional theory in\ndescription H-rich compounds, and demonstrate the importance of considering van\nder Waals interaction in this class of materials.\n", "  Mesoscopic systems -- small electric circuits working in quantum regime --\noffer us a unique experimental stage to explorer quantum transport in a tunable\nand precise way. The purpose of this Review is to show how they can contribute\nto statistical physics. We introduce the significance of fluctuation, or\nequivalently noise, as noise measurement enables us to address the fundamental\naspects of a physical system. The significance of the fluctuation theorem (FT)\nin statistical physics is noted. We explain what information can be deduced\nfrom the current noise measurement in mesoscopic systems. As an important\napplication of the noise measurement to statistical physics, we describe our\nexperimental work on the current and current noise in an electron\ninterferometer, which is the first experimental test of FT in quantum regime.\nOur attempt will shed new light in the research field of mesoscopic quantum\nstatistical physics.\n", "  CFD studies have been performed to demonstrate the effects of rotation on\nlarge wind turbine blades. The 10 MW blade of the Advanced Aerodynamic Tools\nfor Large Rotors (AVATAR) project was selected in the present investigation. In\norder to demonstrate the rotational augmentation, lift coefficients of the\nblade sections were compared with the two-dimensional simulations at consistent\ninflow conditions. The increase of the lift coefficient was observed at the\ninboard section of the blade, showing the effect of rotation. A significant\ndelay of separation point as well as a massive reduction of the wake size occur\nat the inboard blade section. The results of the present manuscript provide\nmore information of the rotational augmentation occurring in the near hub\nregion of wind turbine blades.\n", "  The unsteady characteristics of the flow over thick flatback airfoils have\nbeen investigated by means of CFD calculations. Sandia airfoils which have 35%\nmaximum thickness with three different trailing edge thicknesses were selected.\nThe calculations provided good results compared with available experimental\ndata with regard to the lift curve and the impact of trailing edge thickness.\nUnsteady CFD simulations revealed that the Strouhal number is found to be\nindependent of the lift coefficient before stall and increases with the\ntrailing edge. The present work shows the dependency of the Strouhal number and\nthe wake development on the trailing edge thickness. A recommendation of the\nStrouhal number definition is given for flatback airfoils by considering the\ntrailing edge separation at low angle of attack. The detailed unsteady\ncharacteristics of thick flatback airfoils are discussed more in the present\npaper.\n", "  The application of high pressure can fundamentally modify the crystalline and\nelectronic structures of elements as well as their chemical reactivity, which\ncould lead to the formation of novel materials. Here, we explore the reactivity\nof lithium with sodium under high pressure, using a swarm structure searching\ntechniques combined with first-principles calculations, which identify a\nthermodynamically stable LiNa compound adopting an orthorhombic oP8 phase at\npressure above 355 GPa. The formation of LiNa may be a consequence of strong\nconcentration of electrons transfer from the lithium and the sodium atoms into\nthe interstitial sites, which also leads to opening a relatively wide band gap\nfor LiNa-op8. This is substantially different from the picture that share or\nexchange electrons in common compounds and alloys. In addition, lattice-dynamic\ncalculations indicate that LiNa-op8 remains dynamically stable when pressure\ndecompresses down to 70 GPa.\n", "  We find steady channel flows that are locally optimal for transferring heat\nfrom fixed-temperature walls, under the constraint of a fixed rate of viscous\ndissipation (enstrophy = $Pe^2$), also the power needed to pump the fluid\nthrough the channel. We generate the optima with net flux as a continuation\nparameter, starting from parabolic (Poiseuille) flow, the unique optimum at\nmaximum net flux. Decreasing the flux, we eventually reach optimal flows that\nconcentrate the enstrophy in boundary layers of thickness $\\sim Pe^{-2/5}$ at\nthe channel walls, and have a uniform flow with speed $\\sim Pe^{4/5}$ outside\nthe boundary layers. We explain the scalings using physical arguments with a\nunidirectional flow approximation, and mathematical arguments using a decoupled\napproximation. We also show that with channels of aspect ratio (length/height)\n$L$, the boundary layer thickness scales as $L^{3/5}$ and the outer flow speed\nscales as $L^{-1/5}$ in the unidirectional approximation. At the Reynolds\nnumbers near the turbulent transition for 2D Poiseuille flow in air, we find a\n60\\% increase in heat transferred over that of Poiseuille flow.\n", "  We review the constraints on the small-x gluon PDF that can be derived by\nexploiting the forward D meson production data from the LHCb experiment at\n$\\sqrt{s}=5,7$ and 13 TeV. We then discuss the phenomenological implications of\nthe resulting improved small-x gluon for ultra-high energy astrophysics, in\nparticular neutrino telescopes, as well as for the proposed Future Circular\nCollider (FCC) with $\\sqrt{s}=100$ TeV. We illustrate how at the FCC even\nelectroweak scale cross-sections can become sensitive to the small-x region of\nthe quark and gluon PDFs, and then demonstrate how the addition of the LHCb\nheavy meson production measurements leads to a reduction of PDF uncertainties\nfor various benchmark cross-sections.\n", "  We give a survey of recent results on weak-strong uniqueness for compressible\nand incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, and also make some new\nobservations. The importance of the weak-strong uniqueness principle stems, on\nthe one hand, from the instances of non-uniqueness for the Euler equations\nexhibited in the past years; and on the other hand from the question of\nconvergence of singular limits, for which weak-strong uniqueness represents an\nelegant tool.\n", "  Generalized expressions for second harmonic scattering from isotropically\ndistributed liquid molecules are derived for arbitrary scattering angles and\npolarization states.\n", "  High-energy cosmic rays, impinging on the atmosphere of the Earth initiate\ncascades of secondary particles, the extensive air showers. The electrons and\npositrons in the air shower emit electromagnetic radiation. This emission is\ndetected with the LOFAR radio telescope in the frequency range from 10 to 240\nMHz. The data are used to determine the properties of the incoming cosmic rays.\nThe radio technique is now routinely used to measure the arrival direction, the\nenergy, and the particle type (atomic mass) of cosmic rays in the energy range\nfrom $10^{17}$ to $10^{18}$ eV. This energy region is of particular\nastrophysical interest, since in this regime a transition from a Galactic to an\nextra-galactic origin of cosmic rays is expected. For illustration, the LOFAR\nresults are used to set constraints on models to describe the origin of\nhigh-energy cosmic rays.\n", "  Topological phase transitions in condensed matter systems have shown\nextremely rich physics, unveiling such exotic states of matter as topological\ninsulators, superconductors and superfluids. Photonic topological systems open\na whole new realm of research exhibiting a number of important distinctions\nfrom their condensed matter counterparts. Photonic modes can couple to the\ncontinuum of free space modes which makes it feasible to control and manipulate\nscattering properties of the photonic structure via topology. At the same time,\nthe direct connection of scattering and topological properties of the photonic\nstates allows their probing by spectroscopic means via Fano resonances. Here we\ndemonstrate that the radiative coupling of modes supported by an all-dielectric\nmetasurface can be controlled and tuned under topological phase transitions due\nto band inversion, correspondingly inducing a distinct switching of the quality\nfactors of the resonances associated with the bands. In addition, we develop a\ntechnique to retrieve the topological properties of all-dielectric metasurfaces\nfrom the measured far-field scattering characteristics. The collected\nangle-resolved transmission and reflection spectra allow extracting the\nmomentum-dependent frequencies and lifetimes of the photonic modes. This\nenables retrieval of the effective photonic Hamiltonian, including the effects\nof a synthetic gauge field, and topological invariants~-- pseudo-spin Chern\nnumbers. Our results thus open a new avenue to design a new class of\nmetasurfaces with unique scattering characteristics controlled via topological\neffects. This work also demonstrates how topological states of open systems can\nbe explored via far-field measurements.\n", "  We report on the impact of growth conditions on surface hillock density of\nN-polar GaN grown on nominally on-axis (0001) sapphire substrate by metal\norganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Large reduction in hillock density\nwas achieved by implementation of an optimized high temperature AlN nucleation\nlayer and use of indium surfactant in GaN overgrowth. A reduction by more than\na factor of five in hillock density from 1000 to 170 hillocks/cm$^{-2}$ was\nachieved as a result. Crystal quality and surface morphology of the resultant\nGaN films were characterized by high resolution x-ray diffraction and atomic\nforce microscopy and found to be relatively unaffected by the buffer\nconditions. It is also shown that the density of smaller surface features is\nunaffected by AlN buffer conditions.\n", "  The effect of electron-phonon interactions on optical absorption spectra\nrequires a special treatment in materials with strong electron-hole\ninteractions. We conceptualize these effects as exciton-phonon coupling.\nThrough phonon absorption and emission, the optically accessible excitons are\nscattered into dark finite-momentum exciton states. We derive a practical\nexpression for the exciton-phonon self-energy that relates to the temperature\ndependence of the optical transitions and their broadening. This expression\ndiffers qualitatively from previous approximated expressions found in\nliterature.\n", "  To extend fossil oil supplies, sustainable feed stocks for the production of\nuseful reagents and polymers should be harnessed. In this regard, chemicals\nderived from plants are excellent candidates. While the vast majority of plant\nsources used for polymer science only contain CxHyOz, alkaloids such as\ncaffeine, nicotine, and theophylline possess nitrogen functionality that can\nprovide new functions for bio-derived polymers and their synthesis. In this\ncontext, we exploited the chemistry of theophylline, a natural product found in\nchocolate and tea, to create a cationic poly(theophylline) in a straightforward\nfashion for the first time. We demonstrate how this new polymer can be\nsynthesized and used for the creation of narrowly disperse cationic\nmicrospheres.\n", "  This paper reports on the one-pot synthesis of main-chain\nimidazolium-containing polymers, some of which show unusually high thermal\nstability. The imidazolium polymers were obtained by modified\nDebus-Radziszewski reactions for the chain build-up from simple organic\ncompounds, here pyruvaldehyde, formaldehyde, acetic acid, and a variety of\ndiamines. The reactions were performed in aqueous media at ambient conditions,\nbeing synthetically elegant, convenient and highly efficient. Finally, a simple\nanion-metathesis reaction was conducted to replace the acetate anion with\ndicyanamide, and the thermal properties of the main-chain polyimidazoliums\nbefore and after anion exchange were studied in detail, which demonstrated\nchain cross-linking by the counterion and a coupled unusually high\ncarbonization yield of up to 66 wt% at 900 oC.\n", "  We study correlation functions of a conserved spin-1 current $J_\\mu$ in three\ndimensional Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). We investigate the constraints\nimposed by permutation symmetry and current conservation on the form of three\npoint functions $\\langle J_\\mu J_\\nu \\mathcal O_{\\Delta,\\ell}\\rangle $ and the\nfour point function $\\langle J_\\mu J_\\nu J_\\rho J_\\sigma \\rangle $ and identify\nthe minimal set of independent crossing symmetry conditions. We obtain a\nrecurrence relation for conformal blocks for generic spin-1 operators in three\ndimensions. In the process, we improve several technical points, facilitating\nthe use of recurrence relations. By applying the machinery of the numerical\nconformal bootstrap we obtain universal bounds on the dimensions of certain\nlight operators as well as the central charge. Highlights of our results\ninclude numerical evidence for the conformal collider bound and new constraints\non the parameters of the critical $O(2)$ model. The results obtained in this\nwork apply to any unitary, parity-preserving three dimensional CFT.\n", "  Each year, approximately 300,000 heart valve repair or replacement procedures\nare performed worldwide, including approximately 70,000 aortic valve\nreplacement surgeries in the United States alone. This paper describes progress\nin constructing anatomically and physiologically realistic immersed boundary\n(IB) models of the dynamics of the aortic root and ascending aorta. This work\nbuilds on earlier IB models of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in the aortic\nroot, which previously achieved realistic hemodynamics over multiple cardiac\ncycles, but which also were limited to simplified aortic geometries and\nidealized descriptions of the biomechanics of the aortic valve cusps. By\ncontrast, the model described herein uses an anatomical geometry reconstructed\nfrom patient-specific computed tomography angiography (CTA) data, and employs a\ndescription of the elasticity of the aortic valve leaflets based on a\nfiber-reinforced constitutive model fit to experimental tensile test data.\nNumerical tests show that the model is able to resolve the leaflet biomechanics\nin diastole and early systole at practical grid spacings. The model is also\nused to examine differences in the mechanics and fluid dynamics yielded by\nfresh valve leaflets and glutaraldehyde-fixed leaflets similar to those used in\nbioprosthetic heart valves. Although there are large differences in the leaflet\ndeformations during diastole, the differences in the open configurations of the\nvalve models are relatively small, and nearly identical hemodynamics are\nobtained in all cases considered.\n", "  Polarization measurements of the twilight background with Wide-Angle\nPolarization Camera (WAPC) are used to detect the depolarization effect caused\nby stratospheric aerosol near the altitude of 20 km. Based on a number of\nobservations in central Russia in spring and summer 2016, we found the\nparameters of lognormal size distribution of aerosol particles. This confirmed\nthe previously published results of the colorimetric method as applied to the\nsame twilights. The mean particle radius (about 0.1 micrometers) and size\ndistribution are also in agreement with the recent data of in situ and\nspace-based remote sensing of stratospheric aerosol. Methods considered here\nprovide two independent techniques of the stratospheric aerosol study based on\nthe twilight sky analysis.\n", "  We analysed new wide-field, wide- and narrow-band optical images of IC 59 and\nIC 63, two nebulae which are externally illuminated by the early B-star\n{\\gamma} Cas, with the objective of mapping the extended red emission (ERE), a\ndust-related photoluminescence process that is still poorly understood, in\nthese two clouds. The spatial distribution of the ERE relative to the direction\nof the incident radiation and relative to other emission processes, whose\ncarriers and excitation requirements are known, provides important constraints\non the excitation of the ERE. In both nebulae, we find the ERE intensity to\npeak spatially well before the more extended distribution of mid-infrared\nemission in the unidentified infrared bands, supporting earlier findings that\npoint toward far-ultraviolet (11 eV < E$_\\mathrm{{photon}}$ < 13.6 eV) photons\nas the source of ERE excitation. The band-integrated absolute intensities of\nthe ERE in IC 59 and IC 63 measured relative to the number density of photons\navailable for ERE excitation are lower by about two orders of magnitude\ncompared to ERE intensities observed in the high-latitude diffuse interstellar\nmedium (ISM). This suggests that the lifetime of the ERE carriers is\nsignificantly reduced in the more intense radiation field prevailing in IC 59\nand IC 63, pointing toward potential carriers that are only marginally stable\nagainst photo-processing under interstellar conditions. A model involving\nisolated molecules or molecular ions, capable of inverse internal conversion\nand recurrent fluorescence, appears to provide the most likely explanation for\nour observational results.\n", "  For certain dimensionally-regulated one-, two- and three-loop diagrams,\nproblems of constructing the epsilon-expansion and the analytic continuation of\nthe results are studied. In some examples, an arbitrary term of the\nepsilon-expansion can be calculated. For more complicated cases, only a few\nhigher terms in epsilon are obtained. Apart from the one-loop two- and\nthree-point diagrams, the examples include two-loop (mainly on-shell)\npropagator-type diagrams and three-loop vacuum diagrams. As a by-product, some\nnew relations involving Clausen function, generalized log-sine integrals and\ncertain Euler--Zagier sums are established, and some useful results for the\nhypergeometric functions of argument 1/4 are presented.\n", "  We consider theories with degenerate kinetic terms such as those that arise\nat strong coupling in $N=2$ super Yang-Mills theory. We compute the components\nof generalized $N=1,2$ supersymmetric sigma model actions in two dimensions.\nThe target space coordinates may be matter and/or Yang-Mills superfield\nstrengths.\n"]}
