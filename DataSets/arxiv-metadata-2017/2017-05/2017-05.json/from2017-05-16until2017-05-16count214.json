In underdoped hole cuprates the screening\ncharge converts the charge density in the metallic-plane unit cells in the\nvicinity of the $\\mu^+$ to nearly its value in the insulating state. The\ncurrent-loop ordered state observed by polarized neutron diffraction then\nvanishes in such cells, and also in nearby cells over a distance of order the\nintrinsic correlation length of the loop-ordered state. This in turn strongly\nsuppresses the loop-current field at the $\\mu^+$ site. We estimate this\nsuppressed field in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ and\nLa$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, and find consistency with the observed 0.2--0.3 G\nfield in the former case and the observed upper bound of $\\sim$0.2 G in the\nlatter case. This resolves the controversy between the neutron diffraction and\n$\\mu$SR experiments. The screening calculation also has relevance for the\neffect of other charge impurities in the cuprates, such as the dopants\nthemselves.\n", "  We develop a model-independent test of General Relativity that allows for the\nconstraint of the gravitational wave (GW) polarization content with GW\ndetections of binary compact object inspirals. We first consider three modified\ngravity theories (Brans-Dicke theory, Rosen's theory and Lightman-Lee theory)\nand calculate the response function of ground-based detectors to gravitational\nwaves in the inspiral phase. This allows us to see how additional polarizations\npredicted in these theories modify the General Relativistic prediction of the\nresponse function. We then consider general power-law modifications to the\nHamiltonian and radiation-reaction force and study how these modify the\ntime-domain and Fourier response function when all polarizations are present.\nFrom these general arguments and specific modified gravity examples, we infer\nan improved parameterized post-Einsteinian template family with complete\npolarization content. This family enhances General Relativity templates through\nthe inclusion of new theory parameters, reducing to the former when these\nparameters acquire certain values, and recovering modified gravity predictions\nfor other values, including all polarizations. We conclude by discussing\ndetection strategies to constrain these new, polarization theory parameters by\nconstructing certain null channels through the combination of output from\nmultiple detectors.\n", "  It is shown that a chiral SU(2) model can break Lorentz symmetry\nspontaneously at the Lagrangian level when gauge bosons become massive. This\nmodel seems to propose the principles and conceptual foundations leading to a\nunified picture of fermions, and may reduce the standard theory to a far\nsimpler form. The model suggests describing leptons and quarks as\nquasi-excitations, while electromagnetic and strong interactions as secondary\ninteractions mediated by Nambu-Goldstone bosons originating from spontaneous\nviolations of global SU(2) and rotational symmetries. Both the possibility of\nobserving Lorentz-violating phenomena and their magnitudes are discussed. The\nmodel also provides an alternative scenario for baryon and lepton asymmetries\nof the Universe.\n", "  Quantum de Finetti theorems are a useful tool in the study of correlations in\nquantum multipartite states. In this paper we prove two new quantum de Finetti\ntheorems, both showing that under tests formed by local measurements one can\nget a much improved error dependence on the dimension of the subsystems. We\nalso obtain similar results for non-signaling probability distributions. We\ngive the following applications of the results:\n  We prove the optimality of the Chen-Drucker protocol for 3-SAT, under the\nexponential time hypothesis.\n  We show that the maximum winning probability of free games can be estimated\nin polynomial time by linear programming. We also show that 3-SAT with m\nvariables can be reduced to obtaining a constant error approximation of the\nmaximum winning probability under entangled strategies of O(m^{1/2})-player\none-round non-local games, in which the players communicate O(m^{1/2}) bits all\ntogether.\n  We show that the optimization of certain polynomials over the hypersphere can\nbe performed in quasipolynomial time in the number of variables n by\nconsidering O(log(n)) rounds of the Sum-of-Squares (Parrilo/Lasserre) hierarchy\nof semidefinite programs. As an application to entanglement theory, we find a\nquasipolynomial-time algorithm for deciding multipartite separability.\n  We consider a result due to Aaronson -- showing that given an unknown n qubit\nstate one can perform tomography that works well for most observables by\nmeasuring only O(n) independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of\nthe state -- and relax the assumption of having i.i.d copies of the state to\nmerely the ability to select subsystems at random from a quantum multipartite\nstate.\n  The proofs of the new quantum de Finetti theorems are based on information\ntheory, in particular on the chain rule of mutual information.\n", "  The concept of electromotive force (emf) may be introduced in various ways in\nan undergraduate course of theoretical electromagnetism. The multitude of\nalternate expressions for the emf is often the source of confusion to the\nstudent. We summarize the main ideas, adopting a pedagogical logic that\nproceeds from the general to the specific. The emf of a \"circuit\" is first\ndefined in the most general terms. The expressions for the emf of some familiar\nelectrodynamical systems are then derived in a rather straightforward manner. A\ndiversity of physical situations is thus unified within a common theoretical\nframework.\n", "  A new model other than the classical ones given by Airy, Stokes and Gerstner\nfor the ocean surface wave is constructed. It leads to new understandings for\nthe wave mechanisms: (1) A wave with bigger amplitude or smaller steepness\ntravels faster; (2) The wave breaks when the front angle is bigger than 46.3\ndegree; (3) The magnitude of the wave drift should be smaller than that of the\nknown Stokes drift.\n", "  This paper classifies the splints of the root system of classical Lie\nsuperalgebras as a superalgebraic conversion of the splints of classical root\nsystems. It can be used to derive branching rules, which have potential\nphysical application in theoretical physics.\n", "  The highest superconducting transition temperatures in the cuprates are\nachieved in bilayer and trilayer systems, highlighting the importance of\nintralayer interactions for high Tc. It has been argued that interlayer\nhybridization vanishes along the nodal directions by way of a specific pattern\nof orbital overlap. Recent quantum oscillation measurements in bilayer cuprates\nhave provided evidence for a residual bilayer-splitting at the nodes that is\nsufficiently small to enable magnetic breakdown tunneling at the nodes. Here we\nshow that several key features of the experimental data can be understood in\nterms weak spin-orbit interactions naturally present in bilayer systems, whose\nprimary effect is to cause the magnetic breakdown to be accompanied by a spin\nflip. These features can now be understood include the equidistant set of three\nquantum oscillation frequencies, the asymmetry of the quantum oscillation\namplitudes in c-axis transport compared to ab-plane transport, and the\nanomalous magnetic field angle dependence of the amplitude of side frequencies\nsuggestive of small effective g-factors. We suggest that spin-orbit\ninteractions in bilayer systems can further affect the structure of the nodal\nquasiparticle spectrum in the superconducting phase.\n", "  Some of the most remarkable phenomena---and greatest theoretical\nchallenges---in condensed matter physics arise when $d$ or $f$ electrons are\nneither fully localized around their host nuclei, nor fully itinerant. This\nlocalized/itinerant \"duality\" underlies the correlated electronic states of the\nhigh-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors and the heavy-fermion intermetallics, and is\nnowhere more apparent than in the $5f$ valence electrons of plutonium. Here we\nreport the full set of symmetry-resolved elastic moduli of $PuCoGa_5$---the\nhighest $T_c$ superconductor of the heavy fermions ($T_c$=18.5 K)---and find\nthat the bulk modulus softens anomalously over a wide range in temperature\nabove $T_c$. Because the bulk modulus is known to couple strongly to the\nvalence state, we propose that plutonium valence fluctuations drive this\nelastic softening. This elastic softening is observed to disappear when the\nsuperconducting gap opens at $T_c$, suggesting that plutonium valence\nfluctuations have a strong footprint on the Fermi surface, and that $PuCoGa_5$\navoids a valence-transition by entering the superconducting state. These\nmeasurements provide direct evidence of a valence instability in a plutonium\ncompound, and suggest that the unusually high-$T_c$ in this system is driven by\nvalence fluctuations.\n", "  The study of spontaneous breakdown of spacetime symmetries leads to the\ndiscovery of another type of Higgs mechanism operating in a chiral SU(2) model.\nSome of the Nambu-Goldstone vector mesons emergent from simultaneous violations\nof gauge and Lorentz symmetries are, in this case, absorbed by a left-handed\ndoublet and endow one of the fermions with a right-handed state, while another\npart becomes emergent as photons. Accordingly, this mechanism allows a chiral\nfermion to acquire a mass, and it may enable the emergent theory to reproduce\nthe electromagnetism equivalent to the QED sector in the standard theory. It is\nalso mentioned that the \"fermion-boson puzzle\" known in the presence of a 't\nHooft--Polyakov monopole does not exist in our theory.\n", "  In metals near a quantum critical point, the electrical resistance is thought\nto be determined by the lifetime of the carriers of current, rather than the\nscattering from defects. The observation of $T$-linear resistivity suggests\nthat the lifetime only depends on temperature, implying the vanishing of an\nintrinsic energy scale and the presence of a quantum critical point. Our data\nsuggest that this concept extends to the magnetic field dependence of the\nresistivity in the unconventional superconductor\nBaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_2$ near its quantum critical point. We find that\nthe lifetime depends on magnetic field in the same way as it depends on\ntemperature, scaled by the ratio of two fundamental constants $\\mu_B/k_B$.\nThese measurements imply that high magnetic fields probe the same quantum\ndynamics that give rise to the $T$-linear resistivity, revealing a novel kind\nof magnetoresistance that does not depend on details of the Fermi surface, but\nrather on the balance of thermal and magnetic energy scales. This opens new\nopportunities for the investigation of transport near a quantum critical point\nby using magnetic fields to couple selectively to charge, spin and spatial\nanisotropies.\n", "  Using a simple probabilistic model, we illustrate that a small part of a\nstrongly correlated many-body classical system can show a paradoxical behavior,\nnamely asymptotic stochastic independence. We consider a triangular array such\nthat each row is a list of $n$ strongly correlated random variables. The\ncorrelations are preserved even when $n\\to\\infty$, since the standard central\nlimit theorem does not hold for this array. We show that, if we choose a fixed\nnumber $m<n$ of random variables of the $n$th row and trace over the other\n$n-m$ variables, and then consider $n\\to\\infty$, the $m$ chosen ones can,\nparadoxically, turn out to be independent. However, the scenario can be\ndifferent if $m$ increases with $n$. Finally, we suggest a possible\nexperimental verification of our results near criticality of a second-order\nphase transition.\n", "  We give an expansion of the solution of the evolution equation for the\nmassless Dirac fields in the outer region of de Sitter-Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\nblack hole in terms of resonances. By means of this method we describe the\ndecay of local energy for compactly supported data. The proof uses the cut-off\nresolvent estimates for the semi-classical Schr\\\"odinger operators from Bony\nand H\\\"afner, 2008. The method extends to the Dirac operators on spherically\nsymmetric asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds.\n", "  A measurement of dijet correlations in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}=5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector is presented. Jets are reconstructed\nfrom charged particles measured in the central tracking detectors and neutral\nenergy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The transverse momentum of\nthe full jet (clustered from charged and neutral constituents) and charged jet\n(clustered from charged particles only) is corrected event-by-event for the\ncontribution of the underlying event, while corrections for underlying event\nfluctuations and finite detector resolution are applied on an inclusive basis.\nA projection of the dijet transverse momentum, $k_{\\rm Ty} =\np_\\rm{T,jet}^\\rm{ch+ne} \\; \\rm{sin}(\\Delta\\varphi_{\\rm{dijet}})$ with\n$\\Delta\\varphi_{\\rm{dijet}}$ the azimuthal angle between a full and charged jet\nand $p_\\rm{T,jet}^\\rm{ch+ne}$ the transverse momentum of the full jet, is used\nto study nuclear matter effects in p-Pb collisions. This observable is\nsensitive to the acoplanarity of dijet production and its potential\nmodification in p-Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions. Measurements of\nthe dijet $k_{\\rm Ty}$ as a function of the transverse momentum of the full and\nrecoil charged jet, and the event multiplicity are presented. No significant\nmodification of $k_{\\rm Ty}$ due to nuclear matter effects in p-Pb collisions\nwith respect to the event multiplicity or a PYTHIA8 reference is observed.\n", "  We introduce a Hamiltonian for fermions on a lattice and prove a theorem\nregarding its topological properties. We identify the topological criterion as\na $\\mathbb{Z}_2-$ topological invariant $p(\\textbf{k})$ (the Pfaffian\npolynomial). The topological invariant is not only the first Chern number, but\nalso the sign of the Pfaffian polynomial coming from a notion of duality. Such\nHamiltonian can describe non-trivial Chern insulators, single band\nsuperconductors or multiorbital superconductors. The topological features of\nthese families are completely determined as a consequence of our theorem. Some\nspecific model examples are explicitly worked out, with the computation of\ndifferent possible topological invariants.\n", "  Within the framework of tachyon inflation, we consider different steep\npotentials and check their viability in light of the Planck 2015 data. We see\nthat in this scenario, the inverse power-law potential\n$V(\\phi)=V_{0}(\\phi/\\phi_{0})^{-n}$ with $n=2$ leads to the power-law inflation\nwith the scale factor $a(t)\\propto t^{q}$ where $q>1$, while with $n<2$, it\ngives rise to the intermediate inflation with the scale factor\n$a(t)\\propto\\exp\\left(At^{f}\\right)$ where $A>0$ and $0<f<1$. We find that,\nalthough the inverse power-law potential with $n\\leq 2$ is completely ruled out\nby the Planck 2015 data, the result of this potential for $n>2$ can be\ncompatible with the 95\\% CL region of Planck 2015 TT, TE, EE+lowP data. We\nfurther conclude that the exponential potential\n$V(\\phi)=V_{0}e^{-\\phi/\\phi_{0}}$, the inverse $\\cosh$ potential\n$V(\\phi)=V_{0}/\\cosh(\\phi/\\phi_{0})$, and the mutated exponential potential\n$V(\\phi)=V_{0}\\left[1+(n-1)^{-(n-1)}(\\phi/\\phi_{0})^{n}\\right]e^{-\\phi/\\phi_{0}}$\nwith $n=4$, can be consistent with the 95\\% CL region of Planck 2015 TT, TE,\nEE+lowP data. Moreover, using the $r-n_s$ constraints on the model parameters,\nwe also estimate the running of the scalar spectral index $dn_{s}/d\\ln k$ and\nthe local non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{{\\rm NL}}^{{\\rm local}}$. We find that\nthe lower and upper bounds evaluated for these observables are compatible with\nthe Planck 2015 results.\n", "  Summation of a large class of the functional series, which terms contain\nfactorials, is considered. We first investigated finite partial sums for\ninteger arguments. These sums have the same values in real and all p-adic\ncases. The corresponding infinite functional series are divergent in the real\ncase, but they are convergent and have p-adic invariant sums in p-adic cases.\nWe found polynomials which generate all significant ingredients of these series\nand make connection between their real and p-adic properties. In particular, we\nfound connection of one of our integer sequences with the Bell numbers.\n", "  What happens when the Supreme Court of the United States decides a case\nimpacting one or more publicly-traded firms? While many have observed anecdotal\nevidence linking decisions or oral arguments to abnormal stock returns, few\nhave rigorously or systematically investigated the behavior of equities around\nSupreme Court actions. In this research, we present the first comprehensive,\nlongitudinal study on the topic, spanning over 15 years and hundreds of cases\nand firms. Using both intra- and interday data around decisions and oral\narguments, we evaluate the frequency and magnitude of statistically-significant\nabnormal return events after Supreme Court action. On a per-term basis, we find\n5.3 cases and 7.8 stocks that exhibit abnormal returns after decision. In\ntotal, across the cases we examined, we find 79 out of the 211 cases (37%)\nexhibit an average abnormal return of 4.4% over a two-session window with an\naverage $|t|$-statistic of 2.9. Finally, we observe that abnormal returns\nfollowing Supreme Court decisions materialize over the span of hours and days,\nnot minutes, yielding strong implications for market efficiency in this\ncontext. While we cannot causally separate substantive legal impact from mere\nrevision of beliefs, we do find strong evidence that there is indeed a \"law on\nthe market\" effect as measured by the frequency of abnormal return events, and\nthat these abnormal returns are not immediately incorporated into prices.\n", "  Solids are distinguished from fluids by their ability to resist shear. In\ntraditional solids, the resistance to shear is associated with the emergence of\nbroken translational symmetry as exhibited by a non-uniform density pattern,\nwhich results from either minimizing the energy cost or maximizing the entropy\nor both. In this work, we focus on a class of systems, where this paradigm is\nchallenged. We show that shear-driven jamming in dry granular materials is a\ncollective process controlled solely by the constraints of mechanical\nequilibrium. We argue that these constraints lead to a broken translational\nsymmetry in a dual space that encodes the statistics of contact forces and the\ntopology of the contact network. The shear-jamming transition is marked by the\nappearance of this broken symmetry. We extend our earlier work, by comparing\nand contrasting real space measures of rheology with those obtained from the\ndual space. We investigate the structure and behavior of the dual space as the\nsystem evolves through the rigidity transition in two different shear\nprotocols. We analyze the robustness of the shear-jamming scenario with respect\nto protocol and packing fraction, and demonstrate that it is possible to define\na protocol-independent order parameter in this dual space, which signals the\nonset of rigidity.\n", "  One of Feynman's greatest contributions to physics was the interpretation of\nnegative energies as antimatter in quantum field theory. A key component of\nthis interpretation is the Feynman propagator, which seeks to describe the\nbehavior of antimatter at the virtual particle level. Ironically, it turns out\nthat one can dispense with the Feynman propagator in a direct-action theory of\nfields, while still retaining the interpretation of negative energy solutions\nas antiparticles.\n", "  It is widely believed that the underlying reality behind statistical\nmechanics is a deterministic and unitary time evolution of a many-particle wave\nfunction, even though this is in conflict with the irreversible, stochastic\nnature of statistical mechanics. The usual attempts to resolve this conflict\nfor instance by appealing to decoherence or eigenstate thermalization are\nriddled with problems. This paper considers theoretical physics of thermalized\nsystems as it is done in practise and shows that all approaches to thermalized\nsystems presuppose in some form limits to linear superposition and\ndeterministic time evolution. These considerations include, among others, the\nclassical limit, extensivity, the concepts of entropy and equilibrium, and\nsymmetry breaking in phase transitions and quantum measurement. As a\nconclusion, the paper argues that the irreversibility and stochasticity of\nstatistical mechanics should be taken as a true property of nature. It follows\nthat a gas of a macroscopic number $N$ of atoms in thermal equilibrium is best\nrepresented by a collection of $N$ wave packets of a size of the order of the\nthermal de Broglie wave length, which behave quantum mechanically below this\nscale but classically sufficiently far beyond this scale. In particular, these\nwave packets must localize again after scattering events, which requires\nstochasticity and indicates a connection to the measurement process.\n", "  We generalize the Chebyshev-Bogoliubov-deGennes method to treat multi-band\nsystems to address the temperature dependence of the superconducting (SC) gaps\nof iron based superconductors. Four SC gaps associated with different electron\nand hole pockets of optimally doped Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ were\nclearly identified by angle resolved photo-emission spectroscopy. The few\napproaches that reproduces with success this gap structure are based on\nstrong-coupling theories and required many adjustable parameters. We show that\nan approach with a redistribution of electron population between the hole and\nelectron pockets $\\nu$ with evolving temperature reproduces the different\ncoupling ratios $2\\Delta^{\\nu}(0)/k_{\\rm B} T_c$ in these materials. We define\nthe values that fit the four zero temperature gaps $\\Delta^{\\nu}(0)$ and after\nthat all $\\Delta^{\\nu}(T)$ is obtained without any additional parameter.\n", "  We study the fixed point structure of the Higgs-Yukawa model, with its scalar\nbeing non-minimally coupled to the asymptotically safe gravity, using the\nfunctional renormalization group. We have obtained the renormalization group\nequations for the cosmological and Newton constants, the scalar mass-squared\nand quartic coupling constant, and the Yukawa and non-minimal coupling\nconstants, taking into account all the scalar, fermion, and graviton loops. We\nfind that switching on the fermionic quantum fluctuations makes the non-minimal\ncoupling constant irrelevant around the Gaussian-matter fixed point with the\nasymptotically safe gravity.\n", "  Global, secure quantum channels will require efficient distribution of\nentangled photons. Long distance, low-loss interconnects can only be realized\nusing photons as quantum information carriers. However, a quantum light source\ncombining both high qubit fidelity and on-demand bright emission has proven\nelusive. Here, we show a bright photonic nanostructure generating\npolarization-entangled photon-pairs that strongly violates Bell's inequality. A\nhighly symmetric InAsP quantum dot generating entangled photons is encapsulated\nin a tapered nanowire waveguide to ensure directional emission and efficient\nlight extraction. We collect $\\sim$200 kHz entangled photon-pairs at the first\nlens under 80\\,MHz pulsed excitation, which is a 20 times enhancement as\ncompared to a bare quantum dot without a photonic nanostructure. The performed\nBell test using the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality reveals a clear\nviolation ($S_{\\text{CHSH}}>2$) by up to 9.3 standard deviations. By using a\nnovel quasi-resonant excitation scheme at the wurtzite InP nanowire resonance\nto reduce multi-photon emission, the entanglement fidelity\n($F=0.817\\,\\pm\\,0.002$) is further enhanced without temporal post-selection,\nallowing for the violation of Bell's inequality in the rectilinear-circular\nbasis by 25 standard deviations. Our results on nanowire-based quantum light\nsources highlight their potential application in secure data communication\nutilizing measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution and quantum\nrepeater protocols.\n", "  We present a new quantum gas apparatus for ultracold mixtures of K and Cs\natoms and ultracold samples of KCs ground-state molecules. We demonstrate the\napparatus' capabilities by producing Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) of 39K and\n133Cs in a manner that will eventually allow sequential condensation within one\nexperimental cycle, precise sample overlap, and magnetic association of atoms\ninto KCs molecules. The condensates are created independently without relying\non sympathetic cooling. Our approach is universal and applicable to other\nspecies combinations when the two species show dramatically different behavior\nin terms of loss mechanisms and post laser cooling temperatures, i.e. species\ncombinations that make parallel generation of quantum degenerate samples\nchallenging. We give an outlook over the next experiments involving e.g. sample\nmixing, molecule formation, and transport into a science chamber for\nhigh-resolution spatial imaging of novel quantum-many body phases based on\nK-Cs.\n", "  We compute the exact entropy of one-eighth and one-quarter BPS black holes in\nN=8 and N=4 string theory respectively. This includes all the N=4 CHL models in\nboth K3 and T^4 compactifications. The main result is a measure for the finite\ndimensional integral that one obtains after localization of supergravity on\nAdS_2xS^2. This measure is determined entirely by an anomaly in supersymmetric\nChern-Simons theory on local AdS_3 and takes into account the contribution from\nall the supergravity multiplets. In Chern-Simons theory on compact manifolds\nthis is the anomaly that computes a certain one-loop dependence on the volume\nof the manifold. For one-eighth BPS black holes our results are a first\nprinciples derivation of a measure proposed in arXiv:1111.1161, while in the\ncase of one-quarter BPS black holes our result computes exactly all the\nperturbative or area corrections. Moreover, we argue that instantonic\ncontributions can be incorporated and give evidence by computing the measure\nwhich matches precisely the microscopics. Along with this, we find an unitary\ncondition that truncates the answer to a finite sum of instantons in perfect\nagreement with a microscopic formula. Our results solve a number of puzzles\nrelated to localization in supergravity and constitute a larger number of\nexamples where holography can be shown to hold exactly.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate mutual synchronization of two free-running\nnanomechanical oscillators separated by an effective distance of 30 meters and\ncoupled through light. Due to the finite speed of light, the large separation\nintroduces a significant coupling delay of 139 nanoseconds, approximately four\nand a half times the mechanical oscillation time period. We reveal multiple\nstable states of synchronized oscillations, enabled by delayed coupling, with\ndistinct synchronization frequency in the coupled system. These states are\naccessed by tuning independently the directional coupling strengths. Our\nresults demonstrate rich dynamics and could enable applications in\nreconfigurable radio-frequency networks and novel computing concepts.\n", "  The focusing cubic wave equation in three spatial dimensions has the explicit\nsolution $\\sqrt{2}/t$. We study the stability of the blowup described by this\nsolution as $t \\to 0$ without symmetry restrictions on the data. Via the\nconformal invariance of the equation we obtain a companion result for the\nstability of slow decay in the framework of a hyperboloidal initial value\nformulation. More precisely, we identify a codimension-1 Lipschitz manifold of\ninitial data leading to solutions which converge to Lorentz boosts of\n$\\sqrt{2}/t$ as $t\\to\\infty$. These global solutions thus exhibit a slow\nnondispersive decay, in contrast to small data evolutions.\n", "  We study the transient dynamics of a viscous liquid contained in a narrow gap\nbetween a rigid surface and a parallel elastic plate. The elastic plate is\ndeformed due to an externally applied time-varying pressure-field. We model the\nflow-field via the lubrication approximation, and the plate deformation by the\nKirchhoff-Love plate theory. We obtain a self-similarity solution for the case\nof an external point force acting on the elastic plate. The pressure and\ndeformation field during and after the application of the external force are\nderived and presented by closed form expressions. We examine a uniform external\npressure acting on the elastic plate over a finite region and during a finite\ntime period, similar to the viscous-elastic interaction time-scale. The\ninteraction between elasticity and viscosity is shown to reduce by order of\nmagnitude the pressure within the Hele-Shaw cell compared with the externally\napplied pressure, thus suggesting such configurations may be used for impact\nmitigation.\n", "  We present three major transitions that occur on the way to the elaborate and\ndiverse societies of the modern era. Our account links the worlds of social\nanimals such as pigtail macaques and monk parakeets to examples from human\nhistory, including 18th Century London and the contemporary online phenomenon\nof Wikipedia. From the first awareness and use of group-level social facts to\nthe emergence of norms and their self-assembly into normative bundles, each\ntransition represents a new relationship between the individual and the group.\nAt the center of this relationship is the use of coarse-grained information\ngained via lossy compression. The role of top-down causation in the origin of\nsociety parallels that conjectured to occur in the origin and evolution of life\nitself.\n", "  The multi-orbital Hubbard model is investigated in order to clarify the\nelectron correlation effects and the superconductivity in the iron-based\nsuperconductor. The renormalization effects on the self-energy and the\ntwo-particle irreducible vertex function are calculated on the basis of the\ndynamical mean field theory. We find that the vertex function exhibits a strong\nrenormalization with the significant orbital dependence as compared with the\nrenormalization factor, when the antiferromagnetic and the antiferro-orbital\nfluctuations are comparably enhanced due to the electron and the hole Fermi\nsurfaces nesting effects. The orbital-dependent vertex function together with\nthe $q\\sim0$ nesting between the two-hole Fermi surfaces results in the\ninter-orbital ferromagnetic fluctuation gradually enhanced which is expected to\nbe observed in LiFeAs. We show that the hole-$s_{\\pm}$-wave superconductivity\nwith the sign change of the two-hole Fermi surfaces is realized by the enhanced\nferromagnetic fluctuation accompanied by the antiferromagnetic fluctuation and\nthe antiferro-orbital fluctuation.\n", "  We present a solution for the observed core fragmentation of filaments in the\nTaurus L1517 dark cloud which previously could not be explained (Hacar et. al\n2011). Core fragmentation is a vital step for the formation of stars.\nObservations suggest a connection to the filamentary structure of the cloud gas\nbut it remains unclear which process is responsible. We show that the\ngravitational instability process of an isothermal cylinder can account for the\nexhibited fragmentation under the assumption that the perturbation grows on the\ndominant wavelength. We use numerical simulations with the code RAMSES,\nestimate observed column densities and line-of-sight velocities and compare\nthem to the observations. A critical factor for the observed fragmentation is\nthat cores grow by redistributing mass within the filament and thus the density\nbetween the cores decreases over the fragmentation process. This often leads to\nwrong dominant wavelength estimates as it is strongly dependent on the initial\ncentral density. We argue that non-linear effects also play an important role\non the evolution of the fragmentation. Once the density perturbation grows\nabove the critical line-mass, non-linearity leads to an enhancement of the\ncentral core density in comparison to the analytical prediction. Choosing the\ncorrect initial conditions with perturbation strengths of around 20\\%, leads to\ninclination corrected line-of-sight velocities and central core densities\nwithin the observational measurement error in a realistic evolution time.\n", "  We investigate the ture electromechanical stability of dielectric elastomer\nactuators by considering the competition between Maxwell and mechanical\nstresses. Existing researches based on the positive defiiteness of the nominal\nHessian matrix addressed only the initial load routie stability, i.e., Born\nstability, in the absence of prestresses. We generalize this method to account\nfor electromechanical stability at any prestress state. For large enough\nprestresses, we demonstatre that the previous method for Born stability may\nlead to predcitions that deviate considerably from the true results. The true\nmethod for electromechanical stablity can help the factual design of actuators\nconstructed from dielectric elastomers.\n", "  We study the constraints coming from local causality requirement in various\n$2+1$ dimensional dynamical theories of gravity. In topologically massive\ngravity, with a single parity non-invariant massive degree of freedom, and in\nnew massive gravity, with two massive spin-$2$ degrees of freedom, causality\nand unitarity are compatible with each other and both require the Newton's\nconstant to be negative. In their extensions, such as the Born-Infeld gravity\nand the minimal massive gravity the situation is similar and quite different\nfrom their higher dimensional counterparts, such as quadratic (e.g.,\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet) or cubic theories, where causality and unitarity are in\nconflict. We study the problem both in asymptotically flat and asymptotically\nanti-de Sitter spaces.\n", "  In this paper, we address the problem of how to account for second-order\nstatistics of turbulent flows using low-complexity stochastic dynamical models\nbased on the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. The complexity is quantified\nby the number of degrees of freedom in the linearized evolution model that are\ndirectly influenced by stochastic excitation sources. For the case where only a\nsubset of velocity correlations are known, we develop a framework to complete\nunavailable second-order statistics in a way that is consistent with\nlinearization around turbulent mean velocity. In general, white-in-time\nstochastic forcing is not sufficient to explain turbulent flow statistics. We\ndevelop models for colored-in-time forcing using a maximum entropy formulation\ntogether with a regularization that serves as a proxy for rank minimization. We\nshow that colored-in-time excitation of the Navier-Stokes equations can also be\ninterpreted as a low-rank modification to the generator of the linearized\ndynamics. Our method provides a data-driven refinement of models that originate\nfrom first principles and captures complex dynamics of turbulent flows in a way\nthat is tractable for analysis, optimization, and control design.\n", "  These conferences proceedings summarize the experimental findings obtained in\nsmall collision systems at the LHC, as presented in the special session on \"QGP\nin small systems?\" at the Quark Matter 2015 conference. (The arXiv version is\nsignificantly longer than the printed proceedings, with more details and a\nshort discussion.)\n", "  The New Horizons mission to the Kuiper Belt has recently revealed intriguing\nfeatures on the surface of Charon, including a network of chasmata, cutting\nacross or around a series of high topography features, conjoining to form a\nbelt. It is proposed that this tectonic belt is a consequence of\ncontraction/expansion episodes in the moon's evolution associated particularly\nwith compaction, differentiation and geochemical reactions of the interior. The\nproposed scenario involves no need for solidification of a vast subsurface\nocean and/or a warm initial state. This scenario is based on a new, detailed\nthermo-physical evolution model of Charon that includes multiple processes.\nAccording to the model, Charon experiences two contraction/expansion episodes\nin its history that may provide the proper environment for the formation of the\ntectonic belt. This outcome remains qualitatively the same, for several\ndifferent initial conditions and parameter variations. The precise orientation\nof Charon's tectonic belt, and the cryovolcanic features observed south of the\ntectonic belt may have involved a planetary-scale impact, that occurred only\nafter the belt had already formed.\n", "  It is shown that violation of the Born Rule leads to a breakdown of the\ncorrespondence between the quantum electromagnetic field and its classical\ncounterpart. Specifically, the relationship of the quantum coherent state to\nthe classical electromagnetic field turns out to imply that if the Born Rule\nwere violated, this could result in apparent deviations from the energy\nconservation law applying to the field and its sources (Poynting's Theorem).\nThe result suggests that the Born Rule is just as fundamental a law of Nature\nas are the conservation laws.\n", "  The electrodynamics of topological insulators (TIs) is described by modified\nMaxwell's equations, which contain additional terms that couple an electric\nfield to a magnetization and a magnetic field to a polarization of the medium,\nsuch that the coupling coefficient is quantized in odd multiples of $e^2 / 2 h\nc $ per surface. Here, we report on the observation of this so-called\ntopological magnetoelectric (TME) effect. We use monochromatic terahertz (THz)\nspectroscopy of TI structures equipped with a semi-transparent gate to\nselectively address surface states. In high external magnetic fields, we\nobserve a universal Faraday rotation angle equal to the fine structure constant\n$\\alpha = e^2 / \\hbar c$ when a linearly polarized THz radiation of a certain\nfrequency passes through the two surfaces of a strained HgTe 3D TI. These\nexperiments give insight into axion electrodynamics of TIs and may potentially\nbe used for a metrological definition of the three basic physical constants.\n", "  In this paper, $k$-inflation is analyzed in warm braneworld scenario. A\ngeneral class of $k$-essence models with power-law kinetic term is investigated\nand weak and strong dissipation regimes are studied. Scalar perturbations and\nspectral index are derived. The results are discussed and applied to specific\nexamples.\n", "  Using the theory of $L^p$-graphons (Borgs et al, 2014), we derive and\nrigorously justify the continuum limit for systems of differential equations on\nsparse random graphs. Specifically, we show that the solutions of the initial\nvalue problems for the discrete models can be approximated by those of an\nappropriate nonlocal diffusion equation. Our results apply to a range of\nspatially extended dynamical models of different physical, biological, social,\nand economic networks. Importantly, our assumptions cover network topologies\nfeatured in many important real-world networks. In particular, we derive the\ncontinuum limit for coupled dynamical systems on power law graphs. The latter\nis the main motivation for this work.\n", "  Astronomers have access to precious few nearby, middle-aged benchmark star\nclusters. Within 500 pc, there are only NGC 752 and Ruprecht 147 (R147), at 1.5\nand 3 Gyr respectively. The Database for Galactic Open Clusters (WEBDA) also\nlists Lod\\'{e}n 1 as a 2 Gyr cluster at a distance of 360 pc. If this is true,\nLod\\'{e}n 1 could become a useful benchmark cluster. This work details our\ninvestigation of Lod\\'{e}n 1. We assembled archival astrometry (PPMXL) and\nphotometry (2MASS, Tycho-2, APASS), and acquired medium resolution spectra for\nradial velocity measurements with the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) at the\nSouthern African Large Telescope. We observed no sign of a cluster\nmain-sequence turnoff or red giant branch amongst all stars in the field\nbrighter than $J < 11$. Considering the 29 stars identified by L.O. Lod\\'{e}n\nand listed on SIMBAD as the members of Lod\\'{e}n 1, we found no compelling\nevidence of kinematic clustering in proper motion or radial velocity. Most of\nthese candidates are A stars and red giants, and their observed properties are\nconsistent with distant field stars in the direction of Lod\\'{e}n 1 in the\nGalactic plane. We conclude that the old nearby cluster Lod\\'{e}n 1 is neither\nold, nor nearby, nor a cluster.\n", "  In this paper, we develop a Bernstein dual-Petrov-Galerkin method for the\nnumerical simulation of a two-dimensional fractional diffusion equation. A\nspectral discretization is applied by introducing suitable combinations of dual\nBernstein polynomials as the test functions and the Bernstein polynomials as\nthe trial ones. We derive the exact sparse operational matrix of\ndifferentiation for the dual Bernstein basis which provides a matrix based\napproach for the spatial discretization. It is shown that the method leads to\nbanded linear systems that can be solved efficiently. The stability and\nconvergence of the proposed method is discussed. Finally, some numerical\nexamples are provided to support the theoretical claims and to show the\naccuracy and efficiency of the method.\n", "  We present a unifying, consistent, finite-size-scaling picture for\npercolation theory bringing it into the framework of a general,\nrenormalization-group-based, scaling scheme for systems above their upper\ncritical dimensions $d_c$. Behaviour at the critical point is non-universal in\n$d>d_c=6$ dimensions. Proliferation of the largest clusters, with fractal\ndimension $4$, is associated with the breakdown of hyperscaling there when free\nboundary conditions are used. But when the boundary conditions are periodic,\nthe maximal clusters have dimension $D=2d/3$, and obey random-graph\nasymptotics. Universality is instead manifest at the pseudocritical point,\nwhere the failure of hyperscaling in its traditional form is universally\nassociated with random-graph-type asymptotics for critical cluster sizes,\nindependent of boundary conditions.\n", "  The fermionic signature operator is constructed in Rindler space-time. It is\nshown to be an unbounded self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space of\nsolutions of the massive Dirac equation. In two-dimensional Rindler space-time,\nwe prove that the resulting fermionic projector state coincides with the\nFulling-Rindler vacuum. Moreover, the fermionic signature operator gives a\ncovariant construction of general thermal states, in particular of the Unruh\nstate. The fermionic signature operator is shown to be well-defined in\nasymptotically Rindler space-times. In four-dimensional Rindler space-time, our\nconstruction gives rise to new quantum states.\n", "  We study a nonlocal diffusion equation approximating the dynamics of coupled\nphase oscillators on large graphs. Under appropriate assumptions, the model has\na family of steady state solutions called twisted states. We prove a sufficient\ncondition for stability of twisted states with respect to perturbations in the\nSobolev and BV spaces. As an application, we study stability of twisted states\nin the Kuramoto model on small-world graphs.\n", "  We study the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves in extremely dense\nexotic systems with very unique properties. These EM waves develop a\nlongitudinal component due to interactions with the medium. Renormalization\nscheme of QED is used to understand the propagation of EM waves in both\nlongitudinal and transverse directions. The propagation of EM waves in a\nquantum statistically treatable medium affects the properties of the medium\nitself. The electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability of the medium\nare modified and influence the related behavior of the medium. All the\nelectromagnetic properties of a medium become a function of temperature and\nchemical potential of the medium. We study in detail the modifications of\nelectric permittivity and magnetic permeability and other related properties of\na medium in the superdense stellar objects.\n", "  Most observations of polluted white dwarf atmospheres are consistent with\naccretion of water depleted planetary material. Among tens of known cases,\nmerely two cases involve accretion of objects that contain a considerable mass\nfraction of water. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relative\nscarcity of these detections. Based on a new and highly detailed model, we\nevaluate the retention of water inside icy minor planets during the high\nluminosity stellar evolution that follows the main sequence. Our model fully\nconsiders the thermal, physical, and chemical evolution of icy bodies,\nfollowing their internal differentiation as well as water depletion, from the\nmoment of their birth and through all stellar evolution phases preceding the\nformation of the white dwarf. We also account for different initial\ncompositions and formation times. Our results show that previous studies have\neither underestimated or overestimated water retention. We also reaffirm that\nwater can survive in a variety of circumstances and in great quantities, and\ntherefore other possibilities are discussed in order to explain the infrequency\nof water detections. We find that the most likely explanation is that water\ndoes not survive the dissociation of tidally disrupted minor planets, and\ninstead a direct impact onto the white dwarf is required. We show that this\npossibility is statistically plausible, and predict that if this hypothesis is\ncorrect, future observations of extremely water rich atmospheres will involve\nonly helium dominated DB white dwarfs.\n", "  This essay provides a historical, philosophical, and critical overview of the\ndevelopment of the Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (TI). It\nis separated into two parts. Part I presents the history and development of TI\nfrom 1986 up to 2016 (the time of writing). Part II lays out current areas of\ndivergence among researchers in TI.\n", "  We compute lateral displacements and time-delays for a scattering processes\nof complex multi-soliton solutions of the Korteweg de-Vries equation.The\nresulting expressions are employed to explain the precise distinction between\nsolutions obtained from different techniques, Hirota's direct method and a\nsuperposition principle based on Baecklund transformations. Moreover they\nexplain the internal structures of degenerate compound multi-solitons\npreviously constructed. Their individual one-soliton constituents are\ntime-delayed when scattered amongst each other. We present generic formulae for\nthese time-dependent displacements. By recalling Gardner's transformation\nmethod for conserved charges, we argue that the structure of the asymptotic\nbehaviour resulting from the integrability of the model together with its\nPT-symmetry ensure the reality of all of these charges, including in particular\nthe mass, the momentum and the energy.\n", "  Gauss-Bonnet-dilatonic coupling in four dimension plays an important role to\nexplain late time cosmic evolution. However, this term is an outcome of low\nenergy string effective action and thus ought to be important in the early\nuniverse too. Unfortunately, phase-space formulation of such a theory does not\nexist in the literature due to branching. We therefore consider a modified\ntheory of gravity, which contains a nonminimally coupled scalar-tensor sector\nin addition to higher order scalar curvature invariant term with\nGauss-Bonnet-dilatonic coupling. Such an action unifies early inflation with\nlate-time cosmic acceleration. Quantum version of the theory is also\nwell-behaved.\n", "  Observed baryon asymmetry can be achieved not only by the decay of\nright-handed neutrinos but also by the scattering processes in the reheating\nera. In the latter scenario, new physics in high energy scale does not need to\nbe specified, but only two types of the higher dimensional operator of the\nstandard model particles are assumed in the previous work. In this paper, we\nexamine the origin of the higher dimensional operators assuming models with a\ncertain seesaw mechanism at the high energy scale. The seesaw mechanism seems\nto be a simple realization of the reheating era leptogenesis because the lepton\nnumber violating interaction is included. We show that the effective\ninteraction giving CP violating phases is provided in the several types of\nmodels and also the reheating era leptogenesis actually works in such models.\nAdditionally, we discuss a possibility for lowering the reheating temperature\nin the radiative seesaw models, where the large Yukawa coupling is naturally\nrealized.\n", "  After the discovery of the Higgs boson, understanding the nature of\nelectroweak symmetry breaking and the associated electroweak phase transition\nhas become the most pressing question in particle physics. Answering this\nquestion is a priority for experimental studies. Data from the LHC and future\nlepton collider-based Higgs factories may uncover new physics coupled to the\nHiggs boson, which can induce the electroweak phase transition to become first\norder. Such a phase transition generates a stochastic background of\ngravitational waves, which could potentially be detected by a space-based\ngravitational wave interferometer. In this paper, we survey a few classes of\nmodels in which the electroweak phase transition is strongly first order. We\nidentify the observables that would provide evidence of these models at the LHC\nand next-generation lepton colliders, and we assess whether the corresponding\ngravitational wave signal could be detected by eLISA. We find that most of the\nmodels with first order electroweak phase transition can be covered by the\nprecise measurements of Higgs couplings at the proposed Higgs factories. We\nalso map out the model space that can be probed with gravitational wave\ndetection by eLISA.\n", "  The work is devoted to development of hard electron antineutrino source with\nvariable and regulated (controlled) spectrum. The high flux antineutrino source\nwith hard antineutrino spectrum based on neutron activation of 7Li and\nsubsequent fast beta-decay (T 1/2 = 0.84 s) of the 8Li isotope with emission of\nantineutrino with energy up to 13 MeV - is discussed. Creation of the intensive\nisotope neutrino source of hard spectrum will allow to increase the detection\nstatistics of neutrino interaction and it is especially urgent for oscillation\nexperiments. The scheme of the proposed neutrino source is based on the\ncontinuous transport of the created 8Li to the neutrino detector, which moved\naway from the place of neutron activation. Analytical expressions for lithium\nantineutrino flux is obtained. The discussed source will ensure to increase the\ncross section for reactions with deuteron from several times to tens compare to\nthe reactor antineutrino spectrum. An another unique feature of the\ninstallation is the possibility to vary smoothly the hardness of the\nantineutrino spectrum.\n", "  The WZ production cross section is measured by the CMS experiment at the CERN\nLHC in proton-proton collision data samples corresponding to integrated\nluminosities of 4.9 inverse femtobarns collected at sqrt(s)= 7 TeV, and 19.6\ninverse femtobarns at sqrt(s)= 8 TeV. The measurements are performed using the\nfully-leptonic WZ decay modes with electrons and muons in the final state. The\nmeasured cross sections for 71 < m[Z] < 111 GeV are sigma(pp to WZ; sqrt(s)= 7\nTeV) = 20.14 +/- 1.32 (stat) +/- 1.13 (syst) +/- 0.44 (lumi) pb and sigma(pp to\nWZ; sqrt(s)= 8 TeV) = 24.09 +/- 0.87 (stat) +/- 1.62 (syst) +/- 0.63 (lumi) pb.\nDifferential cross sections with respect to the Z boson pt, the leading jet pt,\nand the number of jets are obtained using the sqrt(s)= 8 TeV data. The results\nare consistent with standard model predictions and constraints on anomalous\ntriple gauge couplings are obtained.\n", "  In this paper we consider the Einstein-Maxwell theory and define a combined\ntransformation composed of diffeomorphism and $U(1)$ gauge transformation. For\ngenerality, we assume that the generator $\\chi$ of such transformation is\nfield-dependent. We define the extended off-shell ADT current and then\noff-shell ADT charge such that they are conserved off-shell for the\nasymptotically field-dependent symmetry generator $\\chi$. Then, we define the\nconserved charge corresponding to the asymptotically field-dependent symmetry\ngenerator $\\chi$. We apply the presented method to find the conserved charges\nof the asymptotically AdS$_{3}$ spacetimes in the context of the\nEinstein-Maxwell theory in three dimensions. Although the usual proposal for\nthe quasi local charges provides divergent global charges for the\nEinstein-Maxwell theory with negative cosmological constant in three\ndimensions, here we avoid this problem by introducing proposed combined\ntransformation $\\chi$.\n", "  We study the role of Hamiltonian complexity in the performance of quantum\nannealers. We consider two general classes of annealing Hamiltonians:\nstoquastic ones, which can be simulated efficiently using the quantum Monte\nCarlo algorithm, and nonstoquastic ones, which cannot be treated efficiently.\nWe implement the latter by adding antiferromagnetically coupled two-spin driver\nterms to the traditionally studied transverse-field Ising model, and compare\ntheir performance to that of similar stoquastic Hamiltonians with\nferromagnetically coupled additional terms. We focus on a model of long-range\nIsing spin glass as our problem Hamiltonian and carry out the comparison\nbetween the annealers by numerically calculating their success probabilities in\nsolving random instances of the problem Hamiltonian in systems of up to 17\nspins. We find that, for a small percentage of mostly harder instances,\nnonstoquastic Hamiltonians greatly outperform their stoquastic counterparts and\ntheir superiority persists as the system size grows. We conjecture that the\nobserved improved performance is closely related to the frustrated nature of\nnonstoquastic Hamiltonians.\n", "  We consider the field theory formulation for directed polymers and interfaces\nin the presence of quenched disorder. Using the distributional zeta-function\nmethod we obtain the average free energy for both systems. In the average free\nenergy appears a series in which all the integer moments of the partition\nfunction, i.e., the replica partition functions, of the model contribute. Using\nthe saddle-point equations derived from the replica partition function, for\npolymers at finite temperature, we proved that the symmetry among replicas must\nbe broken. In the case of an interface, using the saddle-point equations and\nchoosing the replica symmetry ans\\\"atze, we show that the Gaussian\napproximation is exact. As an application of our approach, we calculated the\nwandering exponent for $d=3$ for high temperatures. In the case of adopting\nanother structure in replica space, different from the replica symmetric\nans\\\"atze, we discuss briefly a spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon with\nbreaking of the replica symmetry.\n", "  The neutrino mass ordering is one of the principal unknowns in the neutrino\nsector. Long baseline neutrino experiments have the potential of resolving this\nissue as they are sensitive to large matter effects. The superbeam experiment\nDUNE is one of the most promising candidates to study the neutrino mass\nhierarchy, along with NO$\\nu$A and T2K. But in the presence of non unitarity of\nthe leptonic mixing matrix, the capability of such experiments to discriminate\nbetween the two hierarchies gets suppressed. The mass hierarchy sensitivity of\nDUNE decreases in the presence of new physics. In this paper we analyze the\norigin and extent of this loss of sensitivity at the level of oscillation\nprobabilities, events, mass hierarchy sensitivity and the discovery reach of\nDUNE, NO$\\nu$A and T2K.\n", "  An analog of Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) sector known as mirror QCD (mQCD)\ncan affect the cosmological evolution due to a non-trivial contribution to the\nCosmological Constant analogous to that induced by the ground state in\nnon-perturbative QCD. In this work, we explore a plausible hypothesis for trace\nanomalies cancellation between the usual QCD and mQCD. Such an anomaly\ncancellation between the two gauge theories, if exists in Nature, would lead to\na suppression or even elimination of their contributions to the Cosmological\nConstant. The trace anomaly compensation condition and the form of the\nnon-perturbative mQCD coupling constant in the infrared limit have been\nproposed by analysing a partial non-perturbative solution of the\nEinstein--Yang-Mills equations of motion.\n", "  The prospect of studying topological matter with the precision and control of\natomic physics has driven the development of many techniques for engineering\nartificial magnetic fields and spin-orbit interactions. Recently, the idea of\nintroducing nontrivial topology through the use of internal (or external)\natomic states as effective \"synthetic dimensions\" has garnered attraction for\nits versatility and possible immunity from heating. Here, we directly engineer\ntunable artificial gauge fields through the local control of tunneling phases\nin an effectively two-dimensional manifold of discrete atomic momentum states.\nWe demonstrate the ability to create homogeneous gauge fields of arbitrary\nvalue, directly imaging the site-resolved dynamics of induced chiral currents.\nWe furthermore engineer the first inhomogeneous artificial gauge fields for\ncold atoms, observing the magnetic reflection of atoms incident upon a\nstep-like variation of an artificial vector potential. These results open up\nnew possibilities for the study of topological phases and localization\nphenomena in atomic gases.\n", "  Nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond are a leading modality for\nboth superresolution optical imaging and nanoscale magnetic field sensing. In\nthis work, we solve the remaining key challenge of performing optical magnetic\nimaging and spectroscopy selectively on multiple NV centers that are located\nwithin a diffraction-limited field-of-view. We use spin-RESOLFT microscopy to\nenable precision nanoscale mapping of magnetic field patterns with resolution\ndown to ~20 nm, while employing a low power optical depletion beam. Moreover,\nwe use a shallow NV to demonstrate the detection of proton nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) signals exterior to the diamond, with 50 nm lateral imaging\nresolution and without degrading the proton NMR linewidth.\n", "  The system created in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions is known to behave\nas an almost ideal liquid. In non-central collisions, due to the large orbital\nmomentum, such a system might be the fluid with the highest vorticity ever\ncreated under laboratory conditions. Particles emerging from such a highly\nvorticous fluid are expected to be globally polarized with their spins on\naverage pointing along the system angular momentum. Vorticity-induced\npolarization is the same for particles and antiparticles, but the intense\nmagnetic field generated in these collisions may lead to the splitting in\npolarization. In this paper we outline the thermal approach to the calculation\nof the global polarization phenomenon for particles with spin and we discuss\nthe details of the experimental study of this phenomenon, estimating the effect\nof feed-down. A general formula is derived for the polarization transfer in\ntwo-body decays and, particularly, for strong and electromagnetic decays. We\nfind that accounting for such effects is crucial when extracting vorticity and\nmagnetic field from the experimental data.\n", "  In this work we suggest that a turbulent phase of the Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability can be explained as a universal stochastic wave traveling with\nconstant speed in a properly renormalized system. This wave, originating from\nordinary deterministic chaos in a renormalized time, has two constant limiting\nstates at both sides. These states are related to the initial discontinuity at\nlarge scales and to stationary turbulence at small scales. The theoretical\nanalysis is confirmed with extensive numerical simulations made for a new shell\nmodel, which features basic properties of the phenomenological theory for the\nRayleigh-Taylor instability.\n", "  As there is no quantum error correction code with universal set of\ntransversal gates, several approaches have been proposed which, in combination\nof transversal gates, make universal fault-tolerant quantum computation\npossible. Magic state distillation, code switching, code concatenation and\npieceable fault-tolerance are well-known examples of such approaches. However,\nthe overhead of these approaches is one of the main bottlenecks for large-scale\nquantum computation. In this paper, a hybrid approach is proposed which\ncombines the code concatenation technique with the other mentioned approaches.\nThe proposed approach outperforms code concatenation in terms of both number of\nqubits and error threshold and also significantly reduces the resource overhead\nof code switching, magic state distillation and pieceable fault-tolerance at\nthe cost of reducing the effective distance of the concatenated code for\nimplementing non-transversal gates.\n", "  In the paper the thermodynamics of a cubic cluster with 8 sites at quarter\nfilling is characterized by means of exact diagonalization technique.\nParticular emphasis is put on the behaviour of such response functions as\nspecific heat and magnetic susceptibility. The system is modelled with extended\nHubbard model which includes electron hopping between both first and second\nnearest neighbours as well as coulombic interactions, both on-site and between\nnearest-neighbour sites. The importance of hopping between second nearest\nneighbours and coulombic interactions between nearest neighbours for the\ntemperature dependences of thermodynamic response functions is analysed. In\nparticular, the predictions of Schottky model are compared with the\ncalculations based on the full energy spectrum.\n", "  We study Einstein's equation in $(m+n)D$ and $(1+n)D$ warped spaces\n$(\\bar{M},\\bar{g})$ and classify all such spaces satisfying Einstein equations\n$\\bar{G}=-\\bar{\\Lambda}\\bar{g}$. We show that the warping function not only can\ndetermine the cosmological constant $\\bar{\\Lambda}$ but also it can determine\nthe cosmological constant ${\\Lambda}$ appearing in the induced Einstein\nequations ${G}=-{\\Lambda}{h}$ on $(M_2, h)$. Moreover, we discuss on the origin\nof the $4D$ cosmological constant as an emergent effect of higher dimensional\nwarped spaces.\n", "  The comprehension of tumor growth is a intriguing subject for scientists. New\nresearches has been constantly required to better understand the complexity of\nthis phenomenon. In this paper, we pursue a physical description that account\nfor some experimental facts involving avascular tumor growth. We have proposed\nan explanation of some phenomenological (macroscopic) aspects of tumor, as the\nspatial form and the way it growths, from a individual-level (microscopic)\nformulation. The model proposed here is based on a simple principle:\ncompetitive interaction between the cells dependent on their mutual distances.\nAs a result, we reproduce many empirical evidences observed in real tumors, as\nexponential growth in their early stages followed by a power law growth. The\nmodel also reproduces the fractal space distribution of tumor cells and the\nuniversal behavior presented in animals and tumor growth, conform reported by\nWest, Guiot {\\it et. al.}\\cite{West2001,Guiot2003}. The results suggest that\nthe universal similarity between tumor and animal growth comes from the fact\nthat both are described by the same growth equation - the Bertalanffy-Richards\nmodel - even they does not necessarily share the same biophysical properties.\n", "  In this Letter we propose that for Lax integrable nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations the natural concept of weak solutions is implied by the\ncompatibility condition for the respective distributional Lax pairs. We\nillustrate our proposal by comparing two concepts of weak solutions of the\nmodified Camassa-Holm equation pointing out that in the peakon sector (a family\nof non-smooth solitons) only one of them, namely the one obtained from the\ndistributional compatibility condition, supports the time invariance of the\nSobolev $H^1$ norm.\n", "  A band gap for electronic states in crystals governs various properties of\nsolids, such as transport, optical and magnetic properties. Its estimation and\ncontrol have been an important issue in solid state physics. The band gap can\nbe controlled externally by various parameters, such as pressure, atomic\ncompositions and external field. Sometimes, the gap even collapses by tuning\nsome parameter. In the field of topological insulators, such closing of the gap\nat a time-reversal invariant momentum indicates a band inversion, i.e. it leads\nto a topological phase transition from a normal insulator to a topological\ninsulator. Here we show that the gap losing in inversion-asymmetric crystals is\nuniversal, in the sense that the gap closing always leads either to a Weyl\nsemimetal or a nodal-line semimetal, from an exhaustive study on possible space\ngroups. We here consider three-dimensional spinful systems with time-reversal\nsymmetry. The space group of the system and the wavevector at the gap closing\nuniquely determine which possibility occurs and where the gap-closing points or\nlines lie in the wavevector space after closing of the gap. In particular, we\nshow that an insulator-to-insulator transition never happens, which is in sharp\ncontrast with inversion-symmetric systems.\n", "  This Report summarizes the results of the activities of the LHC Higgs Cross\nSection Working Group in the period 2014-2016. The main goal of the working\ngroup was to present the state-of-the-art of Higgs physics at the LHC,\nintegrating all new results that have appeared in the last few years. The first\npart compiles the most up-to-date predictions of Higgs boson production cross\nsections and decay branching ratios, parton distribution functions, and\noff-shell Higgs boson production and interference effects. The second part\ndiscusses the recent progress in Higgs effective field theory predictions,\nfollowed by the third part on pseudo-observables, simplified template cross\nsection and fiducial cross section measurements, which give the baseline\nframework for Higgs boson property measurements. The fourth part deals with the\nbeyond the Standard Model predictions of various benchmark scenarios of Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model, extended scalar sector, Next-to-Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model and exotic Higgs boson decays. This report\nfollows three previous working-group reports: Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross\nSections: 1. Inclusive Observables (CERN-2011-002), Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross\nSections: 2. Differential Distributions (CERN-2012-002), and Handbook of LHC\nHiggs Cross Sections: 3. Higgs properties (CERN-2013-004). The current report\nserves as the baseline reference for Higgs physics in LHC Run 2 and beyond.\n", "  We propose a spin-star network, where a central spin-$1/2$ is coupled with\nXXZ interaction to $N$ outer spin-$1/2$ particles, as a quantum fuel. If the\nnetwork is in thermal equilibrium with a cold bath, the central spin can have\nan effective temperature larger than the bath one and scaling nonlinearly with\n$N$. The nonlinearity can be tuned to $N^2, N^3$ or $N^4$ with the anisotropy\nparameter of the coupling. Using a stream of central-spin particles to pump a\nmicromaser cavity, we calculate the dynamics of the cavity field using a\ncoarse-grained master equation. Our study reveals that the central-spin beam\neffectively acts as a hot reservoir to the cavity field and brings the field to\na thermal steady-state whose temperature benefits from the same nonlinear\nenhancement with $N$, and results in a highly efficient photonic Carnot engine.\nThe validity of our conclusions is tested against the presence of atomic and\ncavity damping using a microscopic master equation method for typical microwave\ncavity-QED parameters. An alternative equivalent scheme where the spin-$1/2$ is\ncoupled to a macroscopic spin-$(N/2)$ particle is also discussed.\n", "  A quantum system inevitably interacts with its surroundings. In general, one\ndoes not have detailed information on an environment. Identifying the\nenvironmental features can help us to control the environment and its effects\non the dynamics of an open system. Here, we consider a tripartite system and\nintroduce a witness for the initial correlations among environments by means of\nthe concept of the trace distance. Due to the existence of the initial\nenvironmental correlations, a tight upper bound is obtained for the growth of\nthe trace distance of open quantum system states. Therefore, the initial\ncorrelations among the environments subject to particular conditions can be\ndetected by measurements on the open system.\n", "  We measure the large-scale bias of dark matter halos in simulations with\nnon-Gaussian initial conditions of the local type, and compare this bias to the\nresponse of the mass function to a change in the primordial amplitude of\nfluctuations. The two are found to be consistent, as expected from physical\narguments, for three halo-finder algorithms which use different Spherical\nOverdensity (SO) and Friends-of-Friends (FoF) methods. On the other hand, we\nfind that the commonly used prediction for universal mass functions, that the\nscale-dependent bias is proportional to the first-order Gaussian Lagrangian\nbias, does not yield a good agreement with the measurements. For all halo\nfinders, high-mass halos show a non-Gaussian bias suppressed by 10-15% relative\nto the universal mass function prediction. For SO halos, this deviation changes\nsign at low masses, where the non-Gaussian bias becomes larger than the\nuniversal prediction.\n", "  We find that a recently proposed interaction involving the vorticity current\nof electrons, which radiatively induces a photon mass in 3+1 dimensions in the\nlow-energy effective theory, corresponds to confining strings (linear\npotential) between electrons.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of a four-electron four-quantum-dot system\nbased on molecular orbital methods, which hosts a pair of singlet-triplet spin\nqubits. We explicitly take into account of the admixture of electron wave\nfunctions in all dots, and have found that this mixing of wave functions has\nconsequences on the energy spectrum, exchange interaction and the gate\ncrosstalk of the system. Specifically, we have found that when the two\nsinglet-triplet qubits are close enough, some of the states are no longer\ndominated by the computational basis states and the exchange interaction can\nnot simply be understood as the energy difference between the singlet and\ntriplet states. Using the Hund-Mulliken calculation of the Hubbard parameters,\nwe characterize the effective exchange interaction of the system and have found\ngood agreement with results calculated by taking energy differences where\napplicable. We have studied the two commonly conceived schemes coupling two\nqubits, the exchange and capacitive coupling, and have found that when the\ninter-qubit distance is at certain intermediate values, the two kinds of\ncoupling are comparable in strength, complicating analyses of the evolution of\nthe two qubits. We also investigate the gate crosstalk in the system due to the\nquantum mechanical mixing of electron states and have found that while this\neffect is typically very weak, it should not be ignored if the spacing between\nthe qubits are similar to or less than the distance between the double dots\nthat constitute the qubit.\n", "  We introduce an entirely new class of high-order methods for computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) based on the Gaussian Process (GP) family of stochastic\nfunctions. Our approach is to use kernel-based GP prediction methods to\ninterpolate/reconstruct high-order approximations for solving hyperbolic PDEs.\nWe present the GP approach as a new formulation of high-order\n(magneto)hydrodynamic state variable interpolation that furnishes an\nalternative to conventional polynomial-based approaches.\n", "  We analyze the concomitant spontaneous breaking of translation and conformal\nsymmetries by introducing in a CFT a complex scalar operator that acquires a\nspatially dependent expectation value. The model, inspired by the holographic\nQ-lattice, provides a privileged setup to study the emergence of phonons from a\nspontaneous translational symmetry breaking in a conformal field theory and\noffers valuable hints for the treatment of phonons in QFT at large. We first\nanalyze the Ward identity structure by means of standard QFT techniques,\nconsidering both spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking. Next, by\nimplementing holographic renormalization, we show that the same set of Ward\nidentities holds in the holographic Q-lattice. Eventually, relying on the\nholographic and QFT results, we study the correlators realizing the symmetry\nbreaking pattern and how they encode information about the low-energy spectrum.\n", "  Magnetic anisotropy of spin models with directional-dependent interactions in\nthe high-temperature paramagnetic phase is theoretically studied. Using a high\ntemperature expansion, we show that the Ising type directional-dependent\ninteraction gives rise to magnetic anisotropy which depends on the temperature\nas $\\propto T^{-5}$. This phenomenon arises from the anisotropic exchange\ninteraction, and is distinct from the orbital effect, such as van Vleck\nsusceptibility. It is shown that while the quadratic term in the magnetization\nfavors to point the spins along the bond, the fourth order term in\nmagnetization prefers to point spins to the perpendicular direction. The theory\nis applied to the Heisenberg-Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice and a cubic\nlattice model that is potentially relevant to perovskite iridates. We show\nthat, in these models, the anisotropic terms in quadratic order cancels out,\nand the leading order for the magnetic anisotropy arises from the fourth order\ncontribution. The result shows that the anisotropy from the\ndirectional-dependent interaction gives rise to $\\langle100\\rangle$ magnetic\nanisotropy. These results are potentially relevant to heavy transition metal\noxides such as iridates. Experimental observation of the magnitude of\nanisotropic interactions using magnetic torque measurement is also discussed.\n", "  We report on spectra of circuit-quantum-electrodynamics (QED) systems in an\nintermediate regime that lies between the ultrastrong and deep-strong-coupling\nregimes, which have been reported previously in the literature. Our\nexperimental results, along with numerical simulations, demonstrate that as the\ncoupling strength increases, the spectrum of a circuit-QED system undergoes\nmultiple qualitative transformations, such that several coupling regimes are\nidentified, each with its own unique spectral features. The different spectral\ntransformations can be related to crossings between energy level differences\nand to changes in the symmetries of the energy eigenstates. These results allow\nus to use qualitative spectral features to infer certain properties and\nparameters of the system.\n", "  We describe a hybrid quantum system composed of a micrometer-size carbon\nnanotube (CNT) longitudinally coupled to a flux qubit. We demonstrate the\nusefulness of this device for generating high-fidelity nonclassical states of\nthe CNT via dissipative quantum engineering. Sideband cooling of the CNT to its\nground state and generating a squeezed ground state, as a mechanical analogue\nof the optical squeezed vacuum, are two additional examples of the dissipative\nquantum engineering studied here. Moreover, we show how to generate a\nlong-lived macroscopically-distinct superposition (i.e., a Schr\\\"odinger\ncat-like) state. This cat state can be trapped, under some conditions, in a\ndark state, as can be verified by detecting the optical response of control\nfields.\n", "  Revealing hidden features in unlabeled data is called unsupervised feature\nlearning, which plays an important role in pretraining a deep neural network.\nHere we provide a statistical mechanics analysis of the unsupervised learning\nin a restricted Boltzmann machine with binary synapses. A message passing\nequation to infer the hidden feature is derived, and furthermore, variants of\nthis equation are analyzed. A statistical analysis by replica theory describes\nthe thermodynamic properties of the model. Our analysis confirms an entropy\ncrisis preceding the non-convergence of the message passing equation,\nsuggesting a discontinuous phase transition as a key characteristic of the\nrestricted Boltzmann machine. Continuous phase transition is also confirmed\ndepending on the embedded feature strength in the data. The mean-field result\nunder the replica symmetric assumption agrees with that obtained by running\nmessage passing algorithms on single instances of finite sizes. Interestingly,\nin an approximate Hopfield model, the entropy crisis is absent, and a\ncontinuous phase transition is observed instead. We also develop an iterative\nequation to infer the hyper-parameter (temperature) hidden in the data, which\nin physics corresponds to iteratively imposing Nishimori condition. Our study\nprovides insights towards understanding the thermodynamic properties of the\nrestricted Boltzmann machine learning, and moreover important theoretical basis\nto build simplified deep networks.\n", "  Digital pulse shape discrimination has become readily available to\ndistinguish nuclear recoil and electronic recoil events in scintillation\ndetectors. We evaluate digital implementations of pulse shape discrimination\nalgorithms discussed in the literature, namely the Charge Comparison Method,\nPulse-Gradient Analysis, Fourier Series and Standard Event fitting. In\naddition, we present a novel algorithm based on a Laplace Transform. Instead of\nreducing the performance of these algorithms to a single Figure of Merit, we\nevaluate them as function of recoil energy. Specifically, using commercial\nEJ-301 liquid sctintillators, we examine both the resulting acceptance of\nnuclear recoils at a given rejection level of electronic recoils, as well as\nthe purity of the selected nuclear recoil event samples. We find that both a\nStandard Event fit and a Laplace Transform can be used to significantly improve\nthe discrimination capabilities over the whole energy range. Furthermore, we\nshow that the Charge Comparison Method performs poorly in accurately\nidentifying nuclear recoils.\n", "  The gauge hierarchy problem could find a solution within the scenario of\nasymptotic safety for quantum gravity. We discuss a \"resurgence mechanism\"\nwhere the running dimensionless coupling responsible for the Higgs scalar mass\nfirst decreases in the ultraviolet regime and subsequently increases in the\ninfrared regime. A gravity induced large anomalous dimension plays a crucial\nrole for the required \"self-tuned criticality\" in the ultraviolet regime beyond\nthe Planck scale.\n", "  A search is performed for electroweak production of a vector-like top quark\npartner T of charge 2/3 in association with a standard model top or bottom\nquark, using 2.3 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collision data at sqrt(s)\n= 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The search targets T\nquarks decaying to a top quark and a Higgs boson in fully hadronic final\nstates. For a T quark with mass above 1 TeV the daughter top quark and Higgs\nboson are highly Lorentz-boosted and can each appear as a single hadronic jet.\nJet substructure and b tagging techniques are used to identify the top quark\nand Higgs boson jets, and to suppress the standard model backgrounds. An excess\nof events is searched for in the T quark candidate mass distribution in the\ndata, which is found to be consistent with the expected backgrounds. Upper\nlimits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the single T quark\nproduction cross sections and the branching fraction B(T to tH), and these vary\nbetween 0.31 and 0.93 pb for T quark masses in the range 1000-1800 GeV. This is\nthe first search for single electroweak production of a vector-like T quark in\nfully hadronic final states.\n", "  We investigate the propagation dynamics of initially localized excitations in\nspin-1/2 Heisenberg ladders. We consider initial states with two overturned\nspins, either on neighboring sites on the same leg or on the two sites of a\nsingle rung, in an otherwise polarized (ferromagnetic) background. Compared to\nthe corresponding dynamics in a chain (single leg), we observe several\nadditional modes of propagation. We connect these propagation modes to features\nof the spectrum of the ladder system, and to different effective models\ncorresponding to different segments of the spectrum. In addition to the regular\npropagation modes, we observe for one mode a peculiar `jamming' dynamics where\ncomponents of the excitations remain localized in an unusual manner. A\ncomparison with the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain is developed and\nexplored, where a similar phenomenon is shown to occur.\n", "  Identifying the nature and origin of dark matter is one of the major\nchallenges for modern astro and particle physics. Direct dark-matter searches\naim at an observation of dark-matter particles interacting within detectors.\nThe focus of several such searches is on interactions with nuclei as provided\ne.g. by Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. However, there is a variety of\ndark-matter candidates favoring interactions with electrons rather than with\nnuclei. One example are dark photons, i.e., long-lived vector particles with a\nkinetic mixing to standard-model photons. In this work we present constraints\non this kinetic mixing based on data from CRESST-II Phase 2 corresponding to an\nexposure before cuts of 52\\,kg-days. These constraints improve the existing\nones for dark-photon masses between 0.3 and 0.7\\,keV/c$^2$.\n", "  Spin-1/2 compounds A3Cu3AlO2(SO4)4 (A=K, Rb, and Cs) have one-dimensional\n(1D) inequilateral diamond chains. We analyze the temperature dependence of the\nmagnetic susceptibility and determine the magnetic exchange interactions. In\ncontrast to the azurite, a dimer is formed on one of the sides of the diamond.\nFrom numerical analyses of the proposed model, we find that the dimer together\nwith a nearly isolated 1D Heisenberg chain characterizes magnetic properties\nincluding magnetization curve and magnetic excitations. This implies that a\ndimer-monomer composite chain without frustration is a good starting point for\ndescribing these compounds.\n", "  We set out to quantify the number density of quiescent massive compact\ngalaxies at intermediate redshifts. We determine structural parameters based on\ni-band imaging using the CFHT equatorial SDSS Stripe 82 (CS82) survey (~170 sq.\ndegrees) taking advantage of an exquisite median seeing of ~0.6''. We select\ncompact massive (M > 5x10^10 M_sun) galaxies within the redshift range of\n0.2<z<0.6. The large volume sampled allows to decrease the effect of cosmic\nvariance that has hampered the calculation of the number density for this\nenigmatic population in many previous studies. We undertake an exhaustive\nanalysis in an effort to untangle the various findings inherent to the diverse\ndefinition of compactness present in the literature. We find that the absolute\nnumber of compact galaxies is very dependent on the adopted definition and can\nchange up to a factor of >10. We systematically measure a factor of ~5 more\ncompacts at the same redshift than what was previously reported on smaller\nfields with HST imaging, which are more affected by cosmic variance. This means\nthat the decrease in number density from z ~ 1.5 to z ~ 0.2 might be only of a\nfactor of ~2-5, significantly smaller than what previously reported. This\nsupports progenitor bias as the main contributor to the size evolution. This\nmilder decrease is roughly compatible with the predictions from recent\nnumerical simulations. Only the most extreme compact galaxies, with Reff <\n1.5x( M/10^11 M_sun)^0.75 and M > 10^10.7 M_sun, appear to drop in number by a\nfactor of ~20 and hence likely experience a noticeable size evolution.\n", "  We investigate the ordering properties of vertically-vibrated monolayers of\ngranular cylinders in a circular container at high packing fraction. In line\nwith previous works by other groups, we identify liquid-crystalline ordering\nbehaviour similar to that of two-dimensional hard rectangular particles subject\nto thermal equilibrium fluctuations. However, due to dissipation, there is a\nmuch stronger tendency for particles to cluster into parallel arrangements in\nthe granular system. These clusters behave as a polydisperse mixture of long\nlife-time `superparticles', and some aspects of the system behaviour can be\nunderstood by applying mean-field theories for equilibrium hard rectangles,\nbased on two-body correlations, to these `superparticles'. Many other features\nof the granular system are different: (i) For small particle length-to-breadth\nratio $\\kappa$, we identify tetratic ordering at moderate packing fractions and\nsmectic fluctuations at higher packing fractions, with no sharp transition\nbetween the two states. Both types of ordering can be explained in terms of\nclustering. (ii) For large $\\kappa$, strong clustering precludes the\nstabilisation of a uniaxial nematic state, and the system exhibits a mixture of\nrandomly-oriented clusters which, as packing fraction is increased, develops\ninto states with smectic fluctuations, again through a diffuse transition.\n(iii) Vorticity excitations of the velocity field compete with smectic\nordering, causing dynamic fluctuations and the absence of steady states at high\ndensities; the tetratic state, by contrast, is very stiff against vorticity,\nand long-standing steady states, spatially and orientationally homogeneous\nexcept for four symmetrical defects located close to the wall, can be observed.\n", "  We study a class of models in which the Higgs pair production is enhanced at\nhadron colliders by an extra neutral scalar. The scalar particle is produced by\nthe gluon fusion via a loop of new colored particles, and decays into di-Higgs\nthrough its mixing with the Standard Model Higgs. Such a colored particle can\nbe the top/bottom partner, such as in the dilaton model, or a colored scalar\nwhich can be triplet, sextet, octet, etc., called leptoquark, diquark, coloron,\netc., respectively. We examine the experimental constraints from the latest\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) data, and discuss the future prospects of the LHC\nand the Future Circular Collider up to 100TeV. We also point out that the\n2.4$\\sigma$ excess in the $b\\bar b\\gamma\\gamma$ final state reported by the\nATLAS experiment can be interpreted as the resonance of the neutral scalar at\n300GeV.\n", "  An amplitude analysis of the decay $\\Lambda_b^0\\to D^0 p \\pi^-$ is performed\nin the part of the phase space containing resonances in the $D^0 p$ channel.\nThe study is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity\nof 3.0 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions recorded by the LHCb experiment. The\nspectrum of excited $\\Lambda_c^+$ states that decay into $D^0 p$ is studied.\nThe masses, widths and quantum numbers of the $\\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and\n$\\Lambda_c(2940)^+$ resonances are measured. The constraints on the spin and\nparity for the $\\Lambda_c(2940)^+$ state are obtained for the first time. A\nnear-threshold enhancement in the $D^0 p$ amplitude is investigated and found\nto be consistent with a new resonance, denoted the $\\Lambda_c(2860)^+$, of spin\n$3/2$ and positive parity.\n", "  We report measurements of the photon beam asymmetry $\\Sigma$ for the\nreactions $\\vec{\\gamma}p\\to p\\pi^0$ and $\\vec{\\gamma}p\\to p\\eta $ from the\nGlueX experiment using a 9 GeV linearly-polarized, tagged photon beam incident\non a liquid hydrogen target in Jefferson Lab's Hall D. The asymmetries,\nmeasured as a function of the proton momentum transfer, possess greater\nprecision than previous $\\pi^0$ measurements and are the first $\\eta$\nmeasurements in this energy regime. The results are compared with theoretical\npredictions based on $t$-channel, quasi-particle exchange and constrain the\naxial-vector component of the neutral meson production mechanism in these\nmodels.\n", "  We analyze the gKdV equation, a generalized version of Korteweg-de Vries with\nan arbitrary function $f(u)$. In general, for a function $f(u)$ the Lie algebra\nof symmetries of gKdV is the $2$-dimensional Lie algebra of translations of the\nplane $xt$. This implies the existence of plane wave solutions. Indeed, for\nsome specific values of $f(u)$ the equation gKdV admits a Lie algebra of\nsymmetries of dimension grater than $2$. We compute the similarity reductions\ncorresponding to these exceptional symmetries. We prove that the gKdV equation\nhas soliton-like solutions under some general assumptions, and we find a closed\nformula for the plane wave solutions, that are of hyperbolic secant type.\n", "  Disentanglement and loss of quantum correlations due to one global collective\nnoise effect are described for two-qubit Schr\\\"odinger cat and Werner states of\na four level trapped ion quantum system. Once the Jaynes-Cummings ionic\ninteractions are mapped onto a Dirac spinor structure, the elementary tools for\ncomputing quantum correlations of two-qubit ionic states are provided. With\ntwo-qubit quantum numbers related to the total angular momentum and to its\nprojection onto the direction of an external magnetic field (which lifts the\ndegeneracy of the ion's internal levels), a complete analytical profile of\nentanglement for the Schr\\\"odinger cat and Werner states is obtained. Under\nvacuum noise (during spontaneous emission), the two-qubit entanglement in the\nSchr\\\"odinger cat states is shown to vanish asymptotically. Otherwise, the\nrobustness of Werner states is concomitantly identified, with the entanglement\ncontent recovered by their noiseless-like evolution. Most importantly, our\nresults point to a firstly reported sudden transition between classical and\nquantum decay regimes driven by a classical collective noise on the\nSchr\\\"odinger cat states, which has been quantified by the geometric discord.\n", "  We theoretically analyze the effect of parameter fluctuations on the\nsuperradiance phase transition in a setup where a large number of\nsuperconducting qubits are coupled to a single cavity. We include parameter\nfluctuations that are typical of superconducting architectures, such as\nfluctuations in qubit gaps, bias points and qubit-cavity coupling strengths. We\nfind that the phase transition should occur in this case, although it manifests\nitself somewhat differently from the case with no fluctuations. We also find\nthat fluctuations in the qubit gaps and qubit-cavity coupling strengths do not\nnecessarily make it more difficult to reach the transition point. Fluctuations\nin the bias points, however, increase the coupling strength required to reach\nthe quantum phase transition point and enter the superradiant phase. Similarly,\nthese fluctuations lower the critical temperature for the thermal phase\ntransition.\n", "  We demonstrate that in diffusive superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor\n(S/F/S) junctions a finite, {\\it anomalous}, Josephson current can flow even at\nzero phase difference between the S electrodes. The conditions for the\nobservation of this effect are non-coplanar magnetization distribution and a\nbroken magnetization inversion symmetry of the superconducting current. The\nlatter symmetry is intrinsic for the widely used quasiclassical approximation\nand prevent previous works, based on this approximation, from obtaining the\nJosephson anomalous current. We show that this symmetry can be removed by\nintroducing spin-dependent boundary conditions for the quasiclassical equations\nat the superconducting/ferromagnet interfaces in diffusive systems. Using this\nrecipe we considered generic multilayer magnetic systems and determine the\nideal experimental conditions in order to maximize the anomalous current.\n", "  $N$-body cosmological simulations are an essential tool to understand the\nobserved distribution of galaxies. We use the MultiDark simulation suite, run\nwith the Planck cosmological parameters, to revisit the mass and velocity\nfunctions. At redshift $z=0$, the simulations cover four orders of magnitude in\nhalo mass from $\\sim10^{11}M_\\odot$ with 8,783,874 distinct halos and 532,533\nsubhalos. The total volume used is $\\sim$515 Gpc$^3$, more than 8 times larger\nthan in previous studies. We measure and model the halo mass function, its\ncovariance matrix w.r.t halo mass and the large scale halo bias. With the\nformalism of the excursion-set mass function, we explicit the tight\ninterconnection between the covariance matrix, bias and halo mass function. We\nobtain a very accurate ($<2\\%$ level) model of the distinct halo mass function.\nWe also model the subhalo mass function and its relation to the distinct halo\nmass function. The set of models obtained provides a complete and precise\nframework for the description of halos in the concordance Planck cosmology.\nFinally, we provide precise analytical fits of the $V_{max}$ maximum velocity\nfunction up to redshift $z<2.3$ to push for the development of halo occupation\ndistribution using $V_{max}$. The data and the analysis code are made publicly\navailable in the \\textit{Skies and Universes} database.\n", "  The annihilation of dark matter (DM) particles accumulated in the Sun could\nproduce a flux of neutrinos, which is potentially detectable with neutrino\ndetectors/telescopes and the DM elastic scattering cross section can be\nconstrained. Although the process of DM capture in astrophysical objects like\nthe Sun is commonly assumed to be due to interactions only with nucleons, there\nare scenarios in which tree-level DM couplings to quarks are absent, and even\nif loop-induced interactions with nucleons are allowed, scatterings off\nelectrons could be the dominant capture mechanism. We consider this possibility\nand study in detail all the ingredients necessary to compute the neutrino\nproduction rates from DM annihilations in the Sun (capture, annihilation and\nevaporation rates) for velocity-independent and isotropic, velocity-dependent\nand isotropic and momentum-dependent scattering cross sections for DM\ninteractions with electrons and compare them with the results obtained for the\ncase of interactions with nucleons. Moreover, we improve the usual calculations\nin a number of ways and provide analytical expressions in three appendices.\nInterestingly, we find that the evaporation mass in the case of interactions\nwith electrons could be below the GeV range, depending on the high-velocity\ntail of the DM distribution in the Sun, which would open a new mass window for\nsearching for this type of scenarios.\n", "  We describe an instrument that exploits the ongoing revolution in synchrotron\nsources, optics, and detectors to enable in situ studies of metal-organic vapor\nphase epitaxy (MOVPE) growth of III-nitride materials using coherent x-ray\nmethods. The system includes high-resolution positioning of the sample and\ndetector including full rotations, an x-ray transparent chamber wall for\nincident and diffracted beam access over a wide angular range, and minimal\nthermal sample motion, giving the sub-micron positional stability and\nreproducibility needed for coherent x-ray studies. The instrument enables\nsurface x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, microbeam diffraction, and\ncoherent diffraction imaging of atomic-scale surface and film structure and\ndynamics during growth, to provide fundamental understanding of MOVPE\nprocesses.\n", "  We investigate vortex excitations in dilute Bose-Einstein condensates in the\npresence of complex $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric potentials. These complex\npotentials are used to describe a balanced gain and loss of particles and allow\nfor an easier calculation of stationary states in open systems than in a full\ndynamical calculation including the whole environment. We examine the\nconditions under which stationary vortex states can exist and consider\ntransitions from vortex to non-vortex states. In addition, we study the\ninfluences of $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry on the dynamics of non-stationary vortex\nstates placed at off-center positions.\n", "  A large literature has grown up around the proposed use of 'weak\nmeasurements' (i.e., unsharp measurements followed by post-selection) to\nallegedly provide information about hidden ontological features of quantum\nsystems. This paper attempts to clarify the fact that 'weak measurements'\ninvolve strong (projective) measurements on one (pointer) member of an\nentangled system. The only thing 'weak' about such measurements is that the\ncorrelation established via the entanglement does not correspond to eigenstates\nof the 'weakly measured observable' for the remaining component system(s)\nsubject to the weak measurement. All observed statistics are straightforwardly\nand easily predicted by standard quantum mechanics. Specifically, it is noted\nthat measurement of the pointer steers the remaining degree(s) of freedom into\nnew states with new statistical properties-constituting a non-trivial (even if\ngenerally small) disturbance. In addition, standard quantum mechanics readily\nallows us to conditionalize on a final state if we choose, so the\n'post-selection' that features prominently in time-symmetric formulations is\nalso equipment from standard quantum theory. Assertions in the literature that\nweak measurements leave a system negligibly disturbed, and/or that standard\nquantum theory is cumbersome for computing the predicted measurement results,\nare therefore unsupportable, and ontological claims based on such assertions\nneed to be critically reassessed.\n", "  In this work we consider quantum cascade networks in which quantum systems\nare connected through unidirectional channels that can mutually interact giving\nrise to interference effects. In particular we show how to compute master\nequations for cascade systems in an arbitrary interferometric configuration by\nmeans of a collisional model. We apply our general theory to two specific\nexamples: the first consists in two systems arranged in a Mach-Zender-like\nconfiguration; the second is a three system network where it is possible to\ntune the effective chiral interactions between the nodes exploiting\ninterference effects.\n", "  Using transfer operator and fundamental measure theories, we examine the\nstructural and thermodynamic properties of hard rectangles confined between two\nparallel hard walls. The side lengths of the rectangle ($L$ and $D$, $L>D$) and\nthe pore width ($H$) are chosen such that maximum two layers are allowed to\nform in planar order ($L$ is parallel to the wall), while only one in\nhomeotropic order ($D$ is parallel to the wall). We observe three different\nstructures: (i) a low density fluid phase with parallel alignment to the wall,\n(ii) an intermediate and high density fluid phase with two layers and planar\nordering and (iii) a dense single fluid layer with homeotropic ordering. The\nappearance of these phases and the change in the ordering direction with\ndensity is a consequence of the varying close packing structures with $L$ and\n$H$. Interestingly, even three different structures can be observed with\nincreasing density if $L$ is close to $H$.\n", "  We develop the framework for testing Lorentz invariance in the dark matter\nsector using galactic dynamics. We consider a Lorentz violating (LV) vector\nfield acting on the dark matter component of a satellite galaxy orbiting in a\nhost halo. We introduce a numerical model for the dynamics of satellites in a\ngalactic halo and for a galaxy in a rich cluster to explore observational\nconsequences of such an LV field. The orbital motion of a satellite excites a\ntime dependent LV force which greatly affects its internal dynamics. Our\nanalysis points out key observational signatures which serve as probes of LV\nforces. These include modifications to the line of sight velocity dispersion,\nmass profiles and shapes of satellites. With future data and a more detailed\nmodeling these signatures can be exploited to constrain a new region of the\nparameter space describing the LV in the dark matter sector.\n", "  We consider light propagation in a non-magnetized pressureless plasma around\na Kerr black hole. We find the necessary and sufficient condition the plasma\nelectron density has to satisfy to guarantee that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation\nfor the light rays is separable, i.e., that a generalized Carter constant\nexists. For all cases where this condition is satisfied we determine the photon\nregion, i.e., the region in the spacetime where spherical light rays exist. A\nspherical light ray is a light ray that stays on a sphere $r =\n\\mathrm{constant}$ (in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates). Based on these results, we\ncalculate the shadow of a Kerr black hole under the influence of a plasma that\nsatisfies the separability condition. More precisely, we derive an analytical\nformula for the boundary curve of the shadow on the sky of an observer that is\nlocated anywhere in the domain of outer communication. Several examples are\nworked out.\n", "  We report on tunnel-injected deep ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs)\nconfigured with a polarization engineered Al0.75Ga0.25N/ In0.2Ga0.8N tunnel\njunction structure. Tunnel-injected UV LED structure enables n-type contacts\nfor both bottom and top contact layers. However, achieving Ohmic contact to\nwide bandgap n-AlGaN layers is challenging and typically requires high\ntemperature contact metal annealing. In this work, we adopted a compositionally\ngraded top contact layer for non-alloyed metal contact, and obtained a low\ncontact resistance of Rc=4.8x10-5 Ohm cm2 on n-Al0.75Ga0.25N. We also observed\na significant reduction in the forward operation voltage from 30.9 V to 19.2 V\nat 1 kA/cm2 by increasing the Mg doping concentration from 6.2x1018 cm-3 to\n1.5x1019 cm-3. Non-equilibrium hole injection into wide bandgap Al0.75Ga0.25N\nwith Eg>5.2 eV was confirmed by light emission at 257 nm. This work\ndemonstrates the feasibility of tunneling hole injection into deep UV LEDs, and\nprovides a novel structural design towards high power deep-UV emitters.\n", "  In recent years, our understanding of high energy density plasmas has played\nan important role in improving inertial fusion confinement and in emerging new\nfields of physics, such as laboratory astrophysics. Every new idea required\ndeveloping innovative experimental platforms at high power laser facilities,\nsuch as OMEGA or NIF. These facilities, designed to focus all their beams onto\nspherical targets or hohlraum windows, are now required to shine them on more\ncomplex targets. While the pointing on planar geometries is relatively\nstraightforward, it becomes problematic for cylindrical targets, or target with\nmore complex geometries. This publication describes how the distribution of\nlaser beams on a cylindrical target can be done simply by using a set of\nphysical laws as a pointing procedure. The advantage of the method is\nthreefold. First, it is straightforward, requiring no mathematical enterprise\nbesides solving ordinary differential equations. Second, it will converge if a\nlocal optimum exists. Finally, it is computationally inexpensive. Experimental\nresults show that this approach produces a geometrical beam distribution that\nyields cylindrically symmetric implosions.\n", "  Quantum speed limits of relativistic charged spin-0 and spin-1 bosons in the\nbackground of a homogeneous magnetic field are studied on both commutative and\noncommutative planes. We show that, on the commutative plane, the average\nspeeds of wave packets along the radial direction during the interval in which\na quantum state evolving from an initial state to the orthogonal final one can\nnot exceed the speed of light, regardless of the intensities of the magnetic\nfield. However, due to the noncommutativity, the average speeds of the wave\npackets on noncommutative plane will exceed the speed of light in vacuum\nprovided the intensity of the magnetic field is strong enough. It is a clear\nsignature of violating Lorentz invariance in quantum mechanics region.\n", "  A novel technique for remote, non-contact, in situ monitoring of the protein\ncrystal temperature has been developed for the new I23 beamline at the Diamond\nLight Source, a facility dedicated to macromolecular crystallography (MX) with\nlong-wavelength X-rays. The temperature is derived from the\ntemperature-dependant decay time constant of luminescence from a minuscule\nscintillation sensor (0.05 mm3) located in very close proximity to the sample\nunder test. In this work we present the underlying principle of cryogenic\nluminescence lifetime thermometry, discuss the features of the detection\nmethod, the choice of temperature sensor and demonstrate how the temperature\nmonitoring system was integrated within the viewing system of the end-station\nused for the visualisation of protein crystals. The thermometry system was\ncharacterised using a Bi4Ge3O12 (BGO) crystal scintillator that exhibits good\nresponsivity of the decay time constant as function of temperature over a wide\nrange (8-270 K). The scintillation sensor was calibrated and the uncertainty of\nthe temperature measurements over the primary operation temperature range of\nthe beamline (30-150 K) was assessed to be +-1.6 K. It has been shown that the\ntemperature of the sample holder, measured using the luminescence sensor,\nagrees well with the expected value. The technique was applied to characterise\nthe thermal performance of different sample mounts that have been used in MX\nexperiments at the I23 beamline. The thickness of the mount is shown to have\nthe greatest impact upon the temperature distribution across the sample mount.\nAltogether these tests and findings demonstrate the usefulness of the\nthermometry system in highlighting the challenges that remain to be addressed\nfor the in-vacuum MX experiment to become a reliable and indispensable tool for\nstructural biology\n", "  Latest results on mixing and $CP$ violation in the charm decays at the\n$B$-factories are reported.\n", "  We propose a model of an adaptive network of spiking neurons that gives rise\nto a hypernetwork of its dynamic states at the upper level of description. Left\nto itself, the network exhibits a sequence of transient clustering which\nrelates to a traffic in the hypernetwork in the form of a random walk.\nReceiving inputs the system is able to generate reproducible sequences\ncorresponding to stimulus-specific paths in the hypernetwork. We illustrate\nthese basic notions by a simple network of discrete-time spiking neurons\ntogether with its FPGA realization and analyze their properties.\n", "  The mechanism responsible for the afterglow emission of Gamma Ray Bursts\n(GRBs) and its connection to the prompt $\\gamma$-ray emission is still a\ndebated issue. Relations between intrinsic properties of the prompt or\nafterglow emission can help to discriminate between plausible theoretical\nmodels of GRB production. Here we present an overview of the afterglow and\nprompt-afterglow two parameter relations, their physical interpretations, their\nuse as redshift estimators and as possible cosmological tools. A similar task\nhas already been correctly achieved for Supernovae (SNe) Ia by using the peak\nmagnitude-stretch relation, known in the literature as the Phillips relation\n\\citep{phillips93}. The challenge today is to make GRBs, which are amongst the\nfarthest objects ever observed, standardizable candles as the SNe Ia through\nwell established and robust relations. Thus, the study of relations amongst the\nobservable and physical properties of GRBs is highly relevant together with\nselection biases in their physical quantities. Therefore, we describe the state\nof the art of the existing GRB relations, their possible and debated\ninterpretations in view of the current theoretical models and how relations are\ncorrected for selection biases. We conclude that only after an appropriate\nevaluation and correction for selection effects can GRB relations be used to\ndiscriminate among the theoretical models responsible for the prompt and\nafterglow emission and to estimate cosmological parameters.\n", "  Ultracold atoms placed in a tight cigar-shaped trap are usually described in\nterms of the Lieb-Liniger model. We study the extensions of this model which\narise when van der Waals interaction between atoms is taken into account. We\nfind that the corrections induced by the finite range of interactions can\nbecome especially important in the vicinity of narrow Feshbach resonances and\nsuggest realistic schemes of their experimental detection. The interplay of\nconfinement and interactions can lead to effective transparency where the\none-dimensional interactions are weak in a wide range of parameters.\n", "  Graphene-based electromechanical resonators have attracted much interest\nrecently because of the outstanding mechanical and electrical properties of\ngraphene and their various applications. However, the coupling between\nmechanical motion and charge transport has not been explored in graphene. Here,\nwe studied the mechanical properties of a suspended 50-nm-wide graphene\nnanoribbon, which also acts as a single-electron transistor (SET) at low\ntemperature. Using the SET as a sensitive detector, we found that the resonance\nfrequency could be tuned from 82 MHz to 100 MHz and the quality factor exceeded\n30000. The strong charge-mechanical coupling was demonstrated by observing the\nSET induced ~140 kHz resonance frequency shifts and mechanical damping. We also\nfound that the SET can enhance the nonlinearity of the resonator. Our\nSET-coupled graphene mechanical resonator could approach an ultra-sensitive\nmass resolution of ~0.55*10^(-21) g and a force sensitivity of ~1.9*10^(-19)\nN/(Hz)^(1/2), and can be further improved. These properties indicate that our\ndevice is a good platform both for fundamental physical studies and potential\napplications.\n", "  Cosmic rays (CRs) govern the energetics of present-day galaxies and might\nhave also played a pivotal role during the Epoch of Reionization. In\nparticular, energy deposition by low-energy ($E \\lesssim 10$ MeV) CRs\naccelerated by the first supernovae, might have heated and ionized the neutral\nintergalactic medium (IGM) well before ($z \\approx 20$) it was reionized,\nsignificantly adding to the similar effect by X-rays or dark matter\nannihilations. Using a simple, but physically motivated reionization model, and\na thorough implementation of CR energy losses, we show that CRs contribute\nnegligibly to IGM ionization, but heat it substantially, raising its\ntemperature by $\\Delta T=10-200$ K by $z=10$, depending on the CR injection\nspectrum. Whether this IGM pre-heating is uniform or clustered around the first\ngalaxies depends on CR diffusion, in turn governed by the efficiency of\nself-confinement due to plasma streaming instabilities that we discuss in\ndetail. This aspect is crucial to interpret future HI 21 cm observations which\ncan be used to gain unique information on the strength and structure of early\nintergalactic magnetic fields, and the efficiency of CR acceleration by the\nfirst supernovae.\n", "  In this paper we have studied particle collisions around a charged dilaton\nblack hole in 2+1 dimensions. This black hole is a solution to the low energy\nstring action in 2+1 dimensions. Time-like geodesics for charged particles are\nstudied in detail. The center of mass energy for two charged particles\ncolliding closer to the horizon is calculated and shown to be infinite if one\nof the particles has the critical charge.\n", "  We develop a Floquet scattering formalism for the description of\nquasistationary states of microwave photons in a one-dimensional waveguide\ninteracting with a nonlinear cavity by means of a periodically modulated\ncoupling. This model is inspired by the recent progress in engineering of\ntunable coupling schemes with superconducting qubits. We argue that our model\ncan realize the quantum analogue of an optical chopper. We find strong periodic\nmodulations of the transmission and reflection envelopes in the scattered\nfew-photon pulses, including photon compression and blockade, as well as\ndramatic changes in statistics. Our theoretical analysis allows us to explain\nthese non-trivial phenomena as arising from non-adiabatic memory effects.\n", "  By focusing on melancholic features with biological homogeneity, this study\naimed to identify a small number of critical functional connections (FCs) that\nwere specific only to the melancholic type of MDD. On the resting-state fMRI\ndata, classifiers were developed to differentiate MDD patients from healthy\ncontrols (HCs). The classification accuracy was improved from 50 % (93 MDD and\n93 HCs) to 70% (66 melancholic MDD and 66 HCs), when we specifically focused on\nthe melancholic MDD with moderate or severer level of depressive symptoms. It\nshowed 65% accuracy for the independent validation cohort. The biomarker score\ndistribution showed improvements with escitalopram treatments, and also showed\nsignificant correlations with depression symptom scores. This classifier was\nspecific to melancholic MDD, and it did not generalize in other mental\ndisorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD, 54% accuracy) and\nschizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD, 45% accuracy). Among the identified 12\nFCs from 9,316 FCs between whole brain anatomical node pairs, the left DLPFC /\nIFG region, which has most commonly been targeted for depression treatments,\nand its functional connections between Precuneus / PCC, and between right DLPFC\n/ SMA areas had the highest contributions. Given the heterogeneity of the MDD,\nfocusing on the melancholic features is the key to achieve high classification\naccuracy. The identified FCs specifically predicted the melancholic MDD and\nassociated with subjective depressive symptoms. These results suggested key FCs\nof melancholic depression, and open doors to novel treatments targeting these\nregions in the future.\n", "  The presence of topological defects in a material can modify its electrical,\nacoustic or thermal properties. However, when a group of defects is present,\nthe calculations can become quite cumbersome due to the differential equations\nthat can emerge from the modeling. In this work, we express phonons as\ngeodesics of a 2 + 1 spacetime in the presence of a channel of dislocation\ndipoles in a crystalline environment described analytically in the continuum\nlimit with differential geometry methods. We show that such a simple model of\n1D array of topological defects is able to guide phonon waves. The presence of\ndefects indeed distorts the effective metric of the material, leading to an\nanisotropic landscape of refraction index which curves the path followed by\nphonons, with focusing/defocusing properties depending on the angle of the\nincident wave. As a consequence, using Boltzmann transfer equation, we show\nthat the defects may induce an enhancement or a depletion of the elastic energy\ntransport. We comment on the possibility of designing artificial materials\nthrough the presence of topological defects.\n", "  An analytically derived 'integral operator' approach is introduced to\nestimate the expectation value of a quantum operator for an evolving state\nweighted with an exponential function. This allows to compute quantities useful\nin Nuclear Magnetic Resonance or Muon Spectroscopy experiment simulations with\ngreater speed and precision than the standard numerical integration approach.\n", "  We present the transient source detection efficiencies of the Palomar\nTransient Factory (PTF), parameterizing the number of transients that PTF\nfound, versus the number of similar transients that occurred over the same\nperiod in the survey search area but that were missed. PTF was an optical sky\nsurvey carried out with the Palomar 48-inch telescope over 2009-2012, observing\nmore than 8000 square degrees of sky with cadences of between 1 and 5 days,\nlocating around 50,000 non-moving transient sources, and spectroscopically\nconfirming around 1900 supernovae. We assess the effectiveness with which PTF\ndetected transient sources, by inserting ~7 million artificial point sources\ninto real PTF data. We then study the efficiency with which the PTF real-time\npipeline recovered these sources as a function of the source magnitude, host\ngalaxy surface brightness, and various observing conditions (using proxies for\nseeing, sky brightness, and transparency). The product of this study is a\nmulti-dimensional recovery efficiency grid appropriate for the range of\nobserving conditions that PTF experienced, and that can then be used for\nstudies of the rates, environments, and luminosity functions of different\ntransient types using detailed Monte Carlo simulations. We illustrate the\ntechnique using the observationally well-understood class of type Ia\nsupernovae.\n", "  Nano-structured molybdenum-copper composites have been produced through\nsevere plastic deformation of liquid-metal infiltrated Cu30Mo70 and Cu50Mo50\n(wt.%) starting materials. Processing was carried out using high pressure\ntorsion at room temperature with no subsequent sintering treatment, producing a\nporosity-free, ultrafine grained composite. Extensive deformation of the\nCu50Mo50 composite via two-step high-pressure torsion produced equiaxed\nnanoscale grains of Mo and Cu with a grain size of 10-15 nm. Identical\ntreatment of Cu30Mo70 produced a ultrafine, lamellar structure, comprised of Cu\nand Mo layers with thicknesses of ~5 nm and ~10-20 nm, respectively and an\ninterlamellar spacing of 9 nm. This microstructure differs substantially from\nthat of HPT-deformed Cu-Cr and Cu-W composites, in which the lamellar\nmicrostructure breaks down at high strains. The ultrafine-grained structure and\nabsence of porosity resulted in composites with Vickers hardness values of 600\nfor Cu30Mo70 and 475 for Cu50Mo50. The ability to produce Cu30Mo70\nnanocomposites with a combination of high strength, and a fine, oriented\nmicrostructure should be of interest for thermoelectric applications.\n", "  In this article, a feasible switchyard design is proposed for the Shanghai\nsoft x-ray free electron laser facility. In the proposed scheme, a switchyard\nis used to transport the electron beam to different undulator lines.\nThree-dimensional start-to-end simulations have been carried out to research\nthe beam dynamic during transportation. The results show that the emittance of\nthe electron beam increases less than 10%, at meanwhile, the peak current, the\nenergy spread and the bunch length are not spoiled as the beam passes through\nthe switchyard. The microbunching instability of the beam and the jitter of the\nlinear accelerator (linac) are analyzed as well.\n", "  We report the observation of magnetic domains in the exotic,\nantiferromagnetically ordered all-in-all-out state of Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$,\ninduced by spin canting. The all-in-all-out state can be realized by Ising-like\nspins on a pyrochlore lattice and is established in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ below\n0.31 K for external magnetic fields up to 0.14 T. Two different spin\narrangements can fulfill this configuration which leads to the possibility of\nmagnetic domains. The all-in-all-out domain structure can be controlled by an\nexternal magnetic field applied parallel to the [111] direction. This is a\nresult of different spin canting mechanism for the two all-in-all-out\nconfigurations for such a direction of the magnetic field. The change of the\ndomain structure is observed through a hysteresis in the magnetic\nsusceptibility. No hysteresis occurs, however, in case the external magnetic\nfield is applied along [100].\n", "  The mechanical behaviour of solid biological tissues has long been described\nusing models based on classical continuum mechanics. However, the classical\ncontinuum theories of elasticity and viscoelasticity cannot easily capture the\ncontinual remodelling and associated structural changes of biological tissues.\nFurthermore, models drawn from plasticity theory are difficult to apply and\ninterpret in this context, where there is no equivalent of a yield stress or\nflow rule. In this work, we describe a novel one-dimensional mathematical model\nof tissue remodelling based on the multiplicative decomposition of the\ndeformation gradient. We express the mechanical effects of remodelling as an\nevolution equation for the 'effective strain', a measure of the difference\nbetween the current state and a hypothetical mechanically-relaxed state of the\ntissue. This morphoelastic model combines the simplicity and interpretability\nof classical viscoelastic models with the versatility of plasticity theory. A\nnovel feature of our model is that while most models describe growth as a\ncontinuous quantity, here we begin with discrete cells and develop a continuum\nrepresentation of lattice remodelling based on an appropriate limit of the\nbehaviour of discrete cells. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we use\nthis framework to capture qualitative aspects of the continual remodelling\nobserved in fibroblast-populated collagen lattices, in particular its\ncontraction and its subsequent sudden re-expansion when remodelling is\ninterrupted.\n", "  In recent papers, the theory of representations of finite groups has been\nproposed to analyzing the violation of Bell inequalities. In this paper, we\napply this method to more complicated cases. For two partite system, Alice and\nBob each make one of $d$ possible measurements, each measurement has $n$\noutcomes.\n  The Bell inequalities based on the choice of two orbits are derived. The\nclassical bound is only dependent on the number of measurements $d$, but the\nquantum bound is dependent both on $n$ and $d$. Even so, when $d$ is large\nenough, the quantum bound is only dependent on $d$. The subset of probabilities\nfor four parties based on the choice of six orbits under group action is\nderived and its violation is described. Restricting the six orbits to three\nparties by forgetting the last party, and guaranteeing the classical bound\ninvariant, the Bell inequality based on the choice of four orbits is derived.\nMoreover, all the corresponding nonlocal games are analyzed.\n", "  The lack of new physics at the LHC has sparked renewed interest in theories\nof neutral naturalness, in which the Standard Model partners required for\nnaturalness carry no Standard Model charge. The Twin Higgs was the first of\nthese theories to be introduced, but recent work has demonstrated it is only an\nisolated example in a large class of \"orbifold Higgs\" models. In this work we\nstudy an orbifold Higgs model resulting from the orbifold projection by the\nnon-abelian group $S_3$. A model with multiple sectors uncharged under the SM\nemerges. Constraints are placed on the model from Higgs phenomenology and the\nprospects of finding evidence at colliders are discussed.\n", "  We estimate the magnitude today of the primordial magnetic field originating\nat the electroweak phase transition. We find that the field, which at the\nelectroweak phase transition is originally of order $10^{23}-10^{24}$ G\ncorrelated over the Hubble scale, today is of order $10^{-14}$ G at a scale of\norder 2 kpc. This result is consistent with the lower limit on the strength of\nintergalactic magnetic fields obtained by Neronov and Vovk from observations of\nTeV blazars. The field is non-helical. We compare our results with the helical\ncase discussed by Field and Carroll.\n", "  A fundamental problem in medicine and biology is to assign states, e.g.\nhealthy or diseased, to cells, organs or individuals. State assignment or\nmaking a diagnosis is often a nontrivial and challenging process and, with the\nadvent of omics technologies, the diagnostic challenge is becoming more and\nmore serious. The challenge lies not only in the increasing number of measured\nproperties and dynamics of the system (e.g. cell or human body) but also in the\nco-evolution of multiple states and overlapping properties, and degeneracy of\nstates. We develop, from first principles, a generic rational framework for\nstate assignment in cell biology and medicine, and demonstrate its\napplicability with a few simple theoretical case studies from medical\ndiagnostics. We show how disease-related statistical information can be used to\nbuild a comprehensive model that includes the relevant dependencies between\nclinical and laboratory findings (signs) and diseases. In particular, we\ninclude disease-disease and sign-sign interactions. We then study how one can\ninfer the probability of a disease in a patient with given signs. We perform\ncomparative analysis with simple benchmark models to check the performances of\nour models. This first principles approach, as we show, enables the\nconstruction of consensus diagnostic flow charts and facilitates the early\ndiagnosis of disease. Additionally, we envision that our approach will find\napplications in systems biology, and in particular, in characterizing the\nphenome via the metabolome, the proteome, the transcriptome, and the genome.\n", "  We examine the effects of an impending cluster merger on galaxies in the\nlarge scale structure (LSS) RX J0910 at $z =1.105$. Using multi-wavelength\ndata, including 102 spectral members drawn from the Observations of Redshift\nEvolution in Large Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey and precise photometric\nredshifts, we calculate star formation rates and map the specific star\nformation rate density of the LSS galaxies. These analyses along with an\ninvestigation of the color-magnitude properties of LSS galaxies indicate lower\nlevels of star formation activity in the region between the merging clusters\nrelative to the outskirts of the system. We suggest that gravitational tidal\nforces due to the potential of the merging halos may be the physical mechanism\nresponsible for the observed suppression of star formation in galaxies caught\nbetween the merging clusters.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenides represent an ideal testbed to study\nexcitonic effects, spin-related phenomena and fundamental light-matter coupling\nin nanoscopic condensed matter systems. In particular, the valley degree of\nfreedom, which is unique to such direct band gap monolayers with broken\ninversion symmetry, adds fundamental interest in these materials. Here, we\nimplement a Tamm-plasmon structure with an embedded MoSe2 monolayer and study\nthe formation of polaritonic quasi-particles. Strong coupling conditions\nbetween the Tamm-mode and the trion resonance of MoSe2 are established,\nyielding bright luminescence from the polaritonic ground state under\nnon-resonant optical excitation. We demonstrate, that tailoring the\nelectrodynamic environment of the monolayer results in a significantly\nincreased valley polarization. This enhancement can be related to change in\nrecombination dynamics shown in time-resolved photoluminescence measurements.\nWe furthermore observe strong upconversion luminescence from resonantly excited\npolariton states in the lower polariton branch. This upconverted polariton\nluminescence is shown to preserve the valley polarization of the\ntrion-polariton, which paves the way towards combining spin-valley physics and\nexciton scattering experiments.\n", "  Studies about Quantum Information Theory continue actively in many research\ninstitutions. Very recently, pratical setups of large scale quantum computers\nare widely studied e.g. quantum repeaters, memories and processors.\nEntanglement provides us a computational advantage in realization of quantum\nalgorithms. Some ways to quantifiying entanglement were defined. The best\nformal way to quantify it, is the methods that we call Entanglement Measures or\nEntanglement Monotones. In this research area, State Ordering Problem is\ndefined and still an open problem especially for multiparticle entangled\nstates. Fisher Information provides a good background for the solution of some\nactual Information Theory problems. Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a value\nthat could be used in situations where phase sensitivity is important and this\nconcept is expected to be the quantum version of the mentioned inftrastructure\nfor Quantum Systems. QFI cannot be defined as an Entaglement Measure or\nMonotone. In the scope of this thesis, a new optimization technique is proposed\nfor optimizing QFI and thanks to this optimization method, the ordering\nrelation between QFI and entanglement measures is studied. Based on the studies\nmade in the area of quantum state ordering, new and interesting analysis\nresults are found and reported. The main important and interesting result\nachieved is that for two qubit quantum states, QFI maximized under Local\nOperation and Classical Communication has an interesting ordering relation with\nentanglement measures especially with Relative Entropy of Entanglement. Our\nstudy is extended for the qubit-qutrit systems and ordering relations and\nclassification results are presented. For some quantum systems, the changes in\nQFI under decoherence channels are also considered.\n", "  Stellar oscillations appear all across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.\nRecent theoretical studies support their existence also in the atmospheres of M\ndwarfs. These studies predict for them short periodicities ranging from 20~min\nto 3~h. Our Cool Tiny Beats (CTB) programme aims at finding these oscillations\nfor the very first time. With this goal, CTB explores the short time domain of\nM dwarfs using radial velocity data from the HARPS-ESO and HARPS-N\nhigh-precision spectrographs. Here we present the results for the two most\nlong-term stable targets observed to date with CTB, GJ~588 and GJ~699 (i.e.\nBarnard's star). In the first part of this work we detail the correction of\nseveral instrumental effects. These corrections are specially relevant when\nsearching for sub-night signals. Results show no significant signals in the\nrange where M dwarfs pulsations were predicted. However, we estimate that\nstellar pulsations with amplitudes larger than $\\sim0.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-1}$\ncan be detected with a 90% completeness with our observations. This result,\nalong with the excess of power regions detected in the periodograms, open the\npossibility of non-resolved very low amplitude pulsation signals. Next\ngeneration more precise instrumentation would be required to detect such\noscillations. However, the possibility of detecting pulsating M-dwarf stars\nwith larger amplitudes is feasible due to the short size of the analysed\nsample. This motivates the need for completeness of the CTB survey.\n", "  The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem and its descendants represent a class\nof powerful no-go theorems that rule out any short-range-entangled (SRE)\nsymmetric ground state irrespective of the specific Hamiltonian, based only on\ncertain microscopic inputs such as symmetries and particle filling numbers. In\nthis work, we introduce and prove a new class of LSM-type theorems, where any\nsymmetry-allowed SRE ground state must be a symmetry-protected topological\n(SPT) phase with robust gapless edge states. The key ingredient is to replace\nthe lattice translation symmetry in usual LSM theorems by magnetic translation\nsymmetry. These theorems provide new insights into numerical models and\nexperimental realizations of SPT phases in interacting bosons and fermions.\n", "  The direct detection and characterization of exoplanets will be a major\nscientific driver over the next decade, involving the development of very large\ntelescopes and requires high-contrast imaging close to the optical axis. Some\ncomplex techniques have been developed to improve the performance at small\nseparations (coronagraphy, wavefront shaping, etc). In this paper, we study\nsome of the fundamental limitations of high contrast at the instrument design\nlevel, for cases that use a combination of a coronagraph and two deformable\nmirrors for wavefront shaping. In particular, we focus on small-separation\npoint-source imaging (around 1 $\\lambda$/D). First, we analytically or\nsemi-analytically analysing the impact of several instrument design parameters:\nactuator number, deformable mirror locations and optic aberrations (level and\nfrequency distribution). Second, we develop in-depth Monte Carlo simulation to\ncompare the performance of dark hole correction using a generic test-bed model\nto test the Fresnel propagation of multiple randomly generated optics static\nphase errors. We demonstrate that imaging at small separations requires large\nsetup and small dark hole size. The performance is sensitive to the optic\naberration amount and spatial frequencies distribution but shows a weak\ndependence on actuator number or setup architecture when the dark hole is\nsufficiently small (from 1 to $\\lesssim$ 5 $\\lambda$/D).\n", "  We describe the design, implementation and performance of the new hybrid\nparallelization scheme in our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SKIRT, which\nhas been used extensively for modeling the continuum radiation of dusty\nastrophysical systems including late-type galaxies and dusty tori. The hybrid\nscheme combines distributed memory parallelization, using the standard Message\nPassing Interface (MPI) to communicate between processes, and shared memory\nparallelization, providing multiple execution threads within each process to\navoid duplication of data structures. The synchronization between multiple\nthreads is accomplished through atomic operations without high-level locking\n(also called lock-free programming). This improves the scaling behavior of the\ncode and substantially simplifies the implementation of the hybrid scheme. The\nresult is an extremely flexible solution that adjusts to the number of\navailable nodes, processors and memory, and consequently performs well on a\nwide variety of computing architectures.\n", "  We report the first beam-target double-polarization asymmetries in the\n$\\gamma + n(p) \\rightarrow \\pi^- + p(p)$ reaction spanning the nucleon\nresonance region from invariant mass $W$= $1500$ to $2300$ MeV. Circularly\npolarized photons and longitudinally polarized deuterons in $H\\!D$ have been\nused with the CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab. The exclusive final state has\nbeen extracted using three very different analyses that show excellent\nagreement, and these have been used to deduce the {\\it{E}} polarization\nobservable for an effective neutron target. These results have been\nincorporated into new partial wave analyses, and have led to significant\nrevisions for several $\\gamma nN^*$ resonance photo-couplings.\n", "  Beam splitter mediated entanglement of nonlinear photon-added coherent states\nwas studied by Honarasa, Bagheri and Gharaati [1]. We believe that this work\ncontains errors in numerical computations of linear entropy and Mandel\nparameter which lead to wrong conclusions. We point out the possible errors and\ndescribe the necessary corrections. The conclusions based on our arguments are\nin complete agreement with previously published literature.\n", "  The initial mass distribution in the solar nebula is a critical input to\nplanet formation models that seek to reproduce today's Solar System.\nTraditionally, constraints on the gas mass distribution are derived from\nobservations of the dust emission from disks, but this approach suffers from\nlarge uncertainties in grain growth and gas-to-dust ratio. On the other hand,\nprevious observations of gas tracers only probe surface layers above the bulk\nmass reservoir. Here we present the first partially spatially resolved\nobservations of the $^{13}$C$^{18}$O J=3-2 line emission in the closest\nprotoplanetary disk, TW Hya, a gas tracer that probes the bulk mass\ndistribution. Combining it with the C$^{18}$O J=3-2 emission and the previously\ndetected HD J=1-0 flux, we directly constrain the mid-plane temperature and\noptical depths of gas and dust emission. We report a gas mass distribution of\n13$^{+8}_{-5}\\times$(R/20.5AU)$^{-0.9^{+0.4}_{-0.3}}$ g cm$^{-2}$ in the\nexpected formation zone of gas and ice giants (5-21AU). We find the total\ngas/millimeter-sized dust mass ratio is 140 in this region, suggesting that at\nleast 2.4M_earth of dust aggregates have grown to >centimeter sizes (and\nperhaps much larger). The radial distribution of gas mass is consistent with a\nself-similar viscous disk profile but much flatter than the posterior\nextrapolation of mass distribution in our own and extrasolar planetary systems.\n", "  $p$-Adic mathematical physics is a branch of modern mathematical physics\nbased on the application of $p$-adic mathematical methods in modeling physical\nand related phenomena. It emerged in 1987 as a result of efforts to find a\nnon-Archimedean approach to the spacetime and string dynamics at the Planck\nscale, but then was extended to many other areas including biology. This paper\ncontains a brief review of main achievements in some selected topics of\n$p$-adic mathematical physics and its applications, especially in the last\ndecade. Attention is mainly paid to developments with promising future\nprospects.\n", "  We propose a scheme to realize the conditional phase gate (CPG) and quantum\nstate transfer (QST) between two qubits (acted by nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncenters) based on off-resonant quantum Zeno dynamics. We also consider the\nentanglement dynamics of two qubits in this system. Since no cavity photons or\nexcited levels of the NV center is populated during the whole process, the\nscheme is immune to the decay of cavity and spontaneous emission of the NV\ncenter. The strictly numerical simulation shows that the fidelities of QST and\nCPG are high even in the presence of realistic imperfections.\n", "  We outline the phenomenology of the \"dark\" $Z$, denoted by $Z_d$, which is a\ngeneralization of the \"dark\" photon hypothesis. Whereas the dark photon\ninteracts with the Standard Model through kinetic mixing, $Z_d$ is assumed also\nto have mass-mixing with the $Z$ boson. In particular, we highlight the\npossibility of $Z_d$ contributions to low $Q^2$ parity violation measurements\nand rare Higgs decays $H\\to Z Z_d \\to 4 \\ell$, where $\\ell$ is a charged\nlepton. The parity violation effects of a $Z_d$ with an intermediate mass $\\sim\n10-35$ GeV can in principle relieve the mild $\\sim 1.8\\sigma$ tension among\nvarious measurements of the weak mixing angle $\\theta_W$. We briefly comment on\nthe prospects for future parity violation experiments at low $Q^2$ to probe\nthis scenario, which could have correlated signals in rare Higgs decays at the\nLHC.\n", "  This White Paper details the intentions and plans of the East Asian Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry (VLBI) community for pushing the frontiers of\nmillimeter/submillimeter VLBI. To this end, we shall endeavor to actively\npromote coordinated efforts in the East Asia region. Our goal is to establish\nfirm collaborations among the East Asia VLBI community in partnership with\nrelated institutes in North America and Europe and to expand existing global\nmm/submm VLBI arrays for (a) exploring the vicinity of black holes with an\nultimate angular resolution down to 1~R$_{S}$ (Schwarzschild radius) and (b)\ninvestigating the dynamics of circumstellar gas in star-forming regions and\nlate-type stars, and circumnuclear gas around active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In\nthe first half of this White Paper, we highlight scientific accomplishments of\nthe East Asia (EA) VLBI community. Various VLBI research results on M87, Sgr\nA*, blazars, narrow-line Seyfert~1 galaxies, and compact symmetric objects are\ndescribed, and future visions of our VLBI science are briefly presented. Maser\nscience of star formation, stellar evolution, and physics of accretion disks\naround AGNs are also discussed. A new vision for conducting multi-transition\nmaser studies using mm/submm VLBI together with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is described. In the second half of this\nWhite Paper, we describe the EA community's vision for using mm/submm VLBI\narrays in the framework or extended version of the Event Horizon Telescope\n(EHT) and the Global Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA). The accomplishment of the\naforementioned goal will maximize the overall scientific outcomes of mm/submm\nVLBI in the world.\n", "  Large eddy simulation (LES) has become the de-facto computational tool for\nmodeling complex reacting flows, especially in gas turbine applications.\nHowever, readily usable general-purpose LES codes for complex geometries are\ntypically academic or proprietary/commercial in nature. The objective of this\nwork is to develop and disseminate an open source LES tool for low-Mach number\nturbulent combustion using the OpenFOAM framework. In particular, a\ncollocated-mesh approach suited for unstructured grid formulation is provided.\nUnlike other fluid dynamics models, LES accuracy is intricately linked to\nso-called primary and secondary conservation properties of the numerical\ndiscretization schemes. This implies that although the solver only evolves\nequations for mass, momentum, and energy, the implied discrete equation for\nkinetic energy (square of velocity) should be minimally-dissipative. Here, a\nspecific spatial and temporal discretization is imposed such that this kinetic\nenergy dissipation is minimized. The method is demonstrated using manufactured\nsolutions approach on regular and skewed meshes, a canonical flow problem, and\na turbulent sooting flame in a complex domain relevant to gas turbines\napplications.\n", "  The black hole binary Cygnus X-1 has a 5.6 day orbital period. We first\ndetected a clear intensity modulation with the orbital period in its high/soft\nstate with 6 year MAXI data, as well as in its low/hard state. In the low/hard\nstate, the folded light curves showed an intensity drop at the superior\nconjunction of the black hole by a modulation factor (MF), which is the\namplitude divided by the average, with 8+-1%, 4+-1% and 3+-2% for 2-4 keV, 4-10\nand 10-20 keV bands, showing a spectral hardening at the superior conjunction\nof the black hole. Spectral analysis with a model consisting of a power law and\na photoelectric absorption, showed that the hydrogen column density increased\nfrom (2.9+-0.4)E+21 to (4.7+-1.1)E+21 cm^-2 around the superior conjunction,\nalthough more complex spectral variation, such as a partial absorption, was\nsuggested, and the flux of the power law component decreased with 6+-1%. On the\nother hand, the MFs of the folded light curves in the high/soft state, were\n4+-1% and 4+-2% for 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV bands, respectively. We applied a\nmodel consisting of a power law and a diskblackbody with a photoelectric\nabsorption and found a modulation of the flux of the power law component with\n7+-5% in MF, while the modulation of the hydrogen column density was less than\n1E+21 cm^-2. These results can be interpreted as follows; the modulation of\nboth states can be mainly explained by scattering of the X-rays by an ionized\nstellar wind, but only at the superior conjunction in the low/hard state, a\nlarge photoelectric absorption appears, because of a low ionization state of\nthe wind in the line of sight at the phase. Such a condition can be established\nby reasonable parameters of an in-homogeneous wind and the observed\nluminosities.\n", "  We introduce a novel method that combines the accuracy of Quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations with ab-initio Molecular Dynamics, in the spirit of Car-Parrinello.\nThis method is then used for investigating the structure of a two-dimensional\nlayer of hydrogen at $T=0~\\text{K}$ and high densities. We find that\nmetallization is to be expected at $r_s \\approx 1.1$, with an estimated\npressure of $1.0\\cdot10^3~a_0~\\text{GPa}$, changing from a graphene molecular\nlattice to an atomic phase.\n", "  This work presents theoretical demonstration of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect in\nmonolayer phosphorene nanorings (PNR). Atomistic quantum transport simulations\nof PNR are employed to investigate the impact of multiple modulation sources on\nthe sample conductance. In presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, we find\nthat the conductance of both armchair and zigzag PNR oscillate periodically in\na low-energy window as a manifestation of the AB effect. Our numerical results\nhave revealed a giant magnetoresistance (MR) in zigzag PNR (with a maximum\nmagnitude approaching two thousand percent). It is attributed to the AB effect\ninduced destructive interference phase in a wide energy range below the bottom\nof the second subband. We also demonstrate that PNR conductance is highly\nanisotropic, offering an additional way to modulate MR. The giant MR in PNR is\nmaintained at room temperature in the presence of thermal broadening effect.\n", "  This is an expanded version of the third author's lecture in String-Math 2015\nat Sanya. It summarizes some of our works in quantum cohomology.\n  After reviewing the quantum Lefschetz and quantum Leray--Hirsch, we discuss\ntheir applications to the functoriality properties under special smooth flops,\nflips and blow-ups. Finally, for conifold transitions of Calabi--Yau 3-folds,\nformulations for small resolutions (blow-ups along Weil divisors) are sketched.\n", "  Reflection at relativistically moving plasma mirrors is a well-known approach\nfor frequency conversion as an alternative to nonlinear techniques. A key issue\nwith plasma mirrors is the need for a high carrier concentration, of order\n10^21 cm^-3, to achieve an appreciable reflectivity. To generate such high\ncarrier concentrations, short laser pulses with extreme power densities of the\norder >10^15 W/cm^2 are required. Here, we introduce a novel waveguide-based\nmethod for generating relativistically moving plasma mirrors that requires much\nlower pump powers and much less carrier concentration. Specifically, we achieve\nan experimental demonstration of 35% reflection for a carrier concentration of\n5*10^17/cm^3 generated by a power density of only 1.2*10^9 W/cm^2. Both the\nplasma mirror and the signal are confined and propagating within a solid state\nsilicon slow light photonic crystal waveguide. This extraordinary effect only\nbecomes possible because we exploit an indirect intraband optical transition in\na dispersion engineered slow light waveguide, where the incident light cannot\ncouple to other states beyond the moving front and has to reflect from it. The\nmoving free carrier (FC) plasma mirror is generated by two photon absorption of\n6 ps long pump pulse with a peak power of 6.2 W. The reflection was\ndemonstrated by the interaction of a continuous wave (CW) probe wave\nco-propagating with the relativistic FC plasma mirror inside a 400 micro-meter\nlong slow light waveguide. Upon interaction with the FC plasma mirror, the\nprobe wave packets, which initially propagate slower than the plasma mirror,\nare bounced and accelerated, finally escaping from the front in forward\ndirection. The forward reflection of the probe wave packets are accompanied by\na frequency upshift. The reflection efficiency is estimated for the part of the\nCW probe interacting with the pump pulse.\n", "  The present paper provides a method for finding partial differential\nequations satisfied by the Feynman integrals for diagrams of various types,\nusing the Griffiths theorem on the reduction of poles of rational differential\nforms. As an application, an algorithm for computing partial differential\nequations satisfied by Feynman integrals for diagrams of a ladder type is\ndescribed.\n", "  Glassy dynamics is intermittent, as particles suddenly jump out of the cage\nformed by their neighbours, and heterogeneous, as these jumps are not uniformly\ndistributed across the system. Relating these features of the dynamics to the\ndiverse local environments explored by the particles is essential to\nrationalize the relaxation process. Here we investigate this issue\ncharacterizing the local environment of a particle with the amplitude of its\nshort time vibrational motion, as determined by segmenting in cages and jumps\nthe particle trajectories. Both simulations of supercooled liquids and\nexperiments on colloidal suspensions show that particles in large cages are\nlikely to jump after a small time-lag, and that, on average, the cage enlarges\nshortly before the particle jumps. At large time-lags, the cage has essentially\na constant value, which is smaller for longer-lasting cages. Finally, we\nclarify how this coupling between cage size and duration controls the average\nbehaviour and opens the way to a better understanding of the relaxation process\nin glass--forming liquids.\n", "  A novel approach is presented for fast generation of synthetic seismograms\ndue to microseismic events, using heterogeneous marine velocity models. The\npartial differential equations (PDEs) for the 3D elastic wave equation have\nbeen numerically solved using the Fourier domain pseudo-spectral method which\nis parallelizable on the graphics processing unit (GPU) cards, thus making it\nfaster compared to traditional CPU based computing platforms. Due to\ncomputationally expensive forward simulation of large geological models,\nseveral combinations of individual synthetic seismic traces are used for\nspecified microseismic event locations, in order to simulate the effect of\nrealistic microseismic activity patterns in the subsurface. We here explore the\npatterns generated by few hundreds of microseismic events with different source\nmechanisms using various combinations, both in event amplitudes and origin\ntimes, using the simulated pressure and three component particle velocity\nfields via 1D, 2D and 3D seismic visualizations.\n", "  MicroBooNE is a liquid-argon-based neutrino experiment, which began\ncollecting data in Fermilab's Booster neutrino beam in October 2015. Physics\ngoals of the experiment include probing the source of the anomalous excess of\nelectron-like events in MiniBooNE. In addition to this, MicroBooNE is carrying\nout an extensive cross section physics program that will help to probe current\ntheories on neutrino-nucleon interactions and nuclear effects. These\nproceedings summarise the status of MicroBooNE's neutrino cross section\nanalyses.\n", "  Metallic hydrogen is expected to exhibit remarkable physics. Examples include\nhigh-temperature superconductivity and possible novel types of quantum fluids.\nThese could have revolutionary practical applications. The pressures required\nto obtain metallic hydrogen, however, are expected to be significant. For\npractical, and terrestrial applications, a key question is therefore whether\nthis phase is metastable at lower pressures. In this work, this possibility is\ninvestigated, using first-principles simulations. The results show that\nmetallic hydrogen is metastable, but strongly suggest that it is not so to\nambient conditions. Implications of these results for fundamental physics, and\nalso practical applications of metastable metallic hydrogen are discussed.\n", "  We perform a coupled-channels study of the low-lying states in\n$^{13,15,17,19}_{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\Lambda}$C with a covariant energy\ndensity functional based microscopic particle-core coupling model. The energy\ndifferences of $1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ states in $^{13}_\\Lambda$C and\n$^{15}_\\Lambda$C are predicted to be 0.25 MeV and 0.34 MeV, respectively. We\nfind that configuration mixings in the $1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ states of\n$^{15}_\\Lambda$C are the weakest among those of\n$^{13,15,17,19}_{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\Lambda}$C. It indicates that\n$^{15}_\\Lambda$C provides the best candidate among the carbon hypernuclei to\nstudy the spin-orbit splitting of $p_\\Lambda$ hyperon state.\n", "  The Kuramoto model (KM) of coupled phase oscillators on scale free graphs is\nanalyzed in this work. The W-random graph model is used to define a convergent\nfamily of sparse graphs with power law degree distribution. For the KM on this\nfamily of graphs, we derive the mean field description of the system's dynamics\nin the limit as the size of the network tends to infinity. The mean field\nequation is used to study two problems: synchronization in the coupled system\nwith randomly distributed intrinsic frequencies and existence and bifurcations\nof chimera states in the KM with repulsive coupling. The analysis of both\nproblems highlights the role of the scale free network organization in shaping\ndynamics of the coupled system. The analytical results are complemented with\nthe results of numerical simulations.\n", "  Extending researches on Hawking radiation to conformal gravity theory, we\ndiscuss Hawking radiation of different particles across charged rotating AdS\nblack holes in conformal gravity, including charged massive particles, complex\nscalar and spin-$1/2$ Dirac particles. To make the study of rotating black\nholes' tunneling radiation get rid of the dependence on dragging coordinate\nsystems, we investigate the radiation without dragging coordinate\ntransformations. The previous geodesic derivation existed some shortcomings.\nNot only did geodesics of massive and massless particles are derived by using\nquite different approaches, but also the treatment for massive case was\ninconsistent with the variation principle of action. Recently, Wu et al have\nremedied the shortcomings. In this paper, we introduce the improved treatment\nin conformal gravity and derive geodesic equations of massive and massless\nparticles in a unified and self-consistent way. Although the result that the\nblack holes' entropy is not one-quarter of horizon area differs from that in\nEinstein gravity, the tunneling probability of charged massive particles in\nconformal gravity is still related to the change of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.\n", "  The acoustic analogue of the geometry of curved spacetime realised in a\nclassical fluid becomes Lorentz violating in the presence of viscosity. We\nstudy how this effective Lorentz violation affects acoustic superradiance from\nthe ergosphere of a rotating sonic black hole formed in such a fluid. It turns\nout that Lorentz violation imposes an upper bound on frequencies of acoustic\nperturbations that can get scattered from the ergosphere. Incidentally, this\nupper bound is same as that on the spectrum of superradiant frequencies. This\nstudy also reveals how superradiance is in general modified when the wave\npropagates through a dispersive and dissipative medium. Our result is valid\nonly upto linear order in the coefficient of viscosity and is thus a first\napproximation to the full solution, focussing on the key qualitative features.\n", "  The ATLAS and CDF measurements of the W mass are compared discussing some\nsimilarities and differences in the quoted systematic uncertainties.\n", "  In the present work we discuss a possibility to build an instrument with two\noperation modes - spectral and imaging ones. The key element of such instrument\nis a dispersive and filtering unit consisting of two narrowband volume-phase\nholographic gratings. Each of them provides high diffraction efficiency in a\nrelatively narrow spectral range of a few tens of nanometers. Besides, the\nposition of this working band is highly dependent on the angle of incidence. So\nwe propose to use a couple of such gratings to implement the two operational\nmodes. The gratings are mounted in a collimated beam one after another. In the\nspectroscopic mode the gratings are turned on such angle that the diffraction\nefficiency curves coincide, thus the beams diffracted on the first grating are\ndiffracted twice on the second one and a high-dispersion spectrum in a narrow\nrange is formed. If the collimating and camera lenses are corrected for a wide\nfield it is possible to use a long slit and register the spectra from its\ndifferent points separately. In the imaging mode the gratings are turned to\nsuch angle that the efficiency curves intersect in a very narrow wavelength\nrange. So the beams diffracted on the first grating are filtered out by the\nsecond one except of the spectral component, which forms the image. In this\ncase the instrument works without slit diaphragm on the entrance. We provide an\nexample design to illustrate the proposed concept. This optical scheme works in\nthe region around 656 nm with F/# of 6.3. In the spectroscopic mode it provides\na spectrum for the region from 641 to 671 nm with reciprocal linear dispersion\nof 1.4 nm/mm and the spectral resolving power higher than 14000. In the imaging\nmode it covers linear 12mm x 12mm field of view with spatial resolution of\n15-30 lines/mm.\n", "  The current work investigates the soliton solutions of the Kaup-Boussinesq\nequation using the Inverse Scattering Transform method. We outline the\nconstruction of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for a pair energy-dependent\nspectral problems for the system, which we then use to construct the solution\nof this hydrodynamic system.\n", "  The averaging of the dynamic functions of the standard cosmological model\n(SCM) at its early stage with the dominance of the scalar field is carried out.\nIt is shown that microscopic oscillations with Compton period provide the major\ncontribution to the macroscopic energy density of the scalar field at large\ntimes at this stage. In this case, the effective equation of state of the\nscalar field oscillates between the inflationary and the extremely rigid ones,\nwhile the macroscopic equation of state is non-relativistic.\n", "  One of the central concepts in modern theoretical physics, gauge symmetry, is\ntypically realised by lifting a finite-dimensional global symmetry group of a\ngiven functional to an infinite-dimensional local one by extending the\nfunctional to include gauge fields. In this contribution we review the\nconstruction of gauged actions for two-dimensional sigma models, considering a\nmore general notion to be gauged, namely that of a (possibly singular)\nfoliation. In particular, the original action does not need to have any global\nsymmetry for this purpose. Moreover, reformulating the ungauged theory by means\nof auxiliary 1-form fields taking values in the generalised tangent bundle over\nthe target, all possible such gauge theories result from restriction of these\nfields to take values in (possibly small) Dirac structures. This turns all the\nremaining 1-form fields into gauge fields and leads to the presence of a local\nsymmetry. We recall all needed mathematical notions, those of (higher) Lie\nalgebroids, Courant algebroids, and Dirac structures.\n", "  We investigate the gate-voltage dependence of the magnetoconductivity of\nseveral amorphous InGaZnO$_4$ (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). The\nmagnetoconductivity exhibits gate-voltage- controlled competitions between weak\nlocalization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL), and the respective weights\nof WL and WAL contributions demonstrate an intriguing universal dependence on\nthe channel conductivity regardless of the difference in the electrical\ncharacteristics of the a-IGZO TFTs. Our findings help build a theoretical\ninterpretation of the competing WL and WAL observed in the electron systems in\na-IGZO TFTs.\n", "  A nuclear emulsion with micronized crystals is required for the tracking\ndetection of submicron ionizing particles, which are a target of dark matter\ndetection and other methods. We found that a new production method, named as\nthe PVA-Gelatin Mixing Method (PGMM), could effectively control crystal size\nfrom 20 nm to 50 nm. We named two types of an emulsion produced with the new\nmethod NIT and UNIT. The composition and spatial resolution of them were\nmeasured, and the results indicated that these emulsions detect extremely short\ntracks.\n", "  Let $V$ be a vertex operator algebra with a category $\\mathcal{C}$ of\n(generalized) modules that has vertex tensor category structure, and thus\nbraided tensor category structure, and let $A$ be a vertex operator\n(super)algebra extension of $V$. We employ tensor categories to study untwisted\n(also called local) $A$-modules in $\\mathcal{C}$, using results of\nHuang-Kirillov-Lepowsky showing that $A$ is a (super)algebra object in\n$\\mathcal{C}$ and that generalized $A$-modules in $\\mathcal{C}$ correspond\nexactly to local modules for the corresponding (super)algebra object. Both\ncategories, of local modules for a $\\mathcal{C}$-algebra and (under suitable\nconditions) of generalized $A$-modules, have natural braided monoidal category\nstructure, given in the first case by Pareigis and Kirillov-Ostrik and in the\nsecond case by Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang. Our main result is that the\nHuang-Kirillov-Lepowsky isomorphism of categories between local (super)algebra\nmodules and extended vertex operator (super)algebra modules is also an\nisomorphism of braided monoidal (super)categories. Using this result, we show\nthat induction from a suitable subcategory of $V$-modules to $A$-modules is a\nvertex tensor functor. We give two applications. First, we derive Verlinde\nformulae for regular vertex operator superalgebras and regular\n$(1/2)\\mathbb{Z}$-graded vertex operator algebras by realizing them as\n(super)algebra objects in the vertex tensor categories of their even and\n$\\mathbb{Z}$-graded components, respectively. Second, we analyze parafermionic\ncosets $C=\\mathrm{Com}(V_L,V)$ where $L$ is a positive definite even lattice\nand $V$ is regular. If the category of either $V$-modules or $C$-modules is\nunderstood, then our results classify all inequivalent simple modules for the\nother algebra and determine their fusion rules and modular character\ntransformations. We illustrate both directions with several examples.\n", "  We investigate the Fermionic Casimir effect at finite temperature for two\nparallel chain of adatoms in a Graphene sheet, and the corresponding Casimir\nforce is interpreted as an interaction between the adatom chains. We apply\nuseful techniques to find asymptotically explicit expressions for the Casimir\nenergy, for small as well as large temperatures (with respect to the effective\ntemperature of the Graphene). We obtain a value in the order of $10^{-2} N/m$\nfor the Casimir force between (per unit length of) the adatom chains being one\nnanometer apart, which is considerably noticeable e.g. in comparison to the\nexperimental values for built-in tension of a suspended Graphene sheet.\n", "  Recent experiments have shown rotation of the plane of polarization of light\nreflected from the surface of some superconductors. This indicates that time\nreversal and certain mirror symmetries are broken in the ordered phase. The\nphoton energy exceeds the electronic bandwidth, so that completely filled or\ncompletely empty bands must play a role. We show that in strong-coupling theory\na Coulomb interaction may produce an order parameter in the unoccupied band\nthat explains the observations. The theory puts tight constraints on the form\nof the order parameter in different bands. We propose that the experiments have\ndetected, for the first time, the existence of a superconducting order\nparameter in a band far from the Fermi energy.\n", "  Exploiting the energy of randomly moving active agents such as bacteria is a\nfascinating way to power a microdevice. Here we show, by simulations, that a\nchain-grafted disk-like colloid can rotate unidirectionally when immersed in a\nthin film of active particle suspension. The spontaneous symmetry breaking of\nchain configurations is the origin of the unidirectional rotation. Long\npersistence time, large propelling force and/or small rotating friction are\nkeys to keeping the broken symmetry and realizing the rotation. In the rotating\nstate, we find very simple linear relations, e.g. between mean angular speed\nand propelling force. The time-evolving asymmetry of chain configurations\nreveals that there are two types of non-rotating state. Our findings provide\nnew insights into the phenomena of spontaneous symmetry breaking in active\nsystems with flexible objects and also open the way to conceive new\nsoft/deformable microdevices.\n", "  We demonstrate the control of resonance characteristics of a drum type\ngraphene mechanical resonator in nonlinear oscillation regime by the\nphotothermal effect, which is induced by a standing wave of light between a\ngraphene and a substrate. Unlike the conventional Duffing type nonlinearity,\nthe resonance characteristics in nonlinear oscillation regime is modulated by\nthe standing wave of light despite a small variation amplitude. From numerical\ncalculations with a combination of equations of heat and motion with Duffing\ntype nonlinearity, this can be explained that the photothermal effect causes\ndelayed modulation of stress or tension of the graphene.\n", "  I describe two new searches for sterile neutrino oscillations from the MINOS\nand Daya Bay experiments. MINOS looked for evidence through muon neutrino\ndisappearance with data collected from the NuMI neutrino beam. Daya Bay\nsearched for evidence through electron antineutrino disappearance using data\ncollected from nuclear reactors. I explain how the MINOS and Daya Bay searches\nwere combined to produce constraints on the same phase space as LSND and\nMiniBooNE. Finally, I present the status of the sterile neutrino search using\ndata from MINOS+.\n", "  A new organic superconductor, possibly with formula $K_3$ p-terphenyl, has\nbeen discovered by Wang, Gao, Huang and Chen, reaching a very high $T_c$ of\nabout 120~K. Besides a clear diamagnetic signal, most other details such as\nstoichiometry and structure are yet unknown. However, pristine p-terphenyl has\na familiar $P2_1/a$ staggered bimolecular structure, and it can be reasonably\nassumed that a similar bimolecular structure could be retained by hypothetical\n$K_3$ p-terphenyl. We point out that the resulting 2-narrow band metal would\nsupport the same $s_{\\pm}$ superconductivity recently proposed for doped\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as La-phenanthrene or $K_3$-picene. In\nthat model, narrow bands, a large Hubbard $U$ and the neighbourhood of a Mott\ntransition enhance superconductivity rather than damaging it.\n", "  The 10 MeV accelerator-driven subcritical system (ADS) Injector-I test stand\nat Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) is a testing facility dedicated to\ndemonstrate one of the two injector design schemes [Injector Scheme-I, which\nworks at 325 MHz], for the ADS project in China. The Injector adopted a four\nvane copper structure RFQ with output energy of 3.2 MeV and a superconducting\n(SC) section accommodating fourteen \\b{eta}g=0.12 single spoke cavities,\nfourteen SC solenoids and fourteen cold BPMs. The ion source was installed\nsince April of 2014, periods of commissioning are regularly scheduled between\ninstallation phases of the rest of the injector. Continuous wave (CW) beam was\nshooting through the injector and 10 MeV CW proton beam with average beam\ncurrent around 2 mA was obtained recently. This contribution describe the\nresults achieved so far and the difficulties encountered in CW commissioning.\n", "  Photodetectors with broadband optical response have promising applications in\nmany advanced optoelectronic and photonic devices. Especially, those with the\ndetection range up to mid-infrared at room temperature are very challenging and\nhighly desired. Recently, Weyl semimetal has been discovered and proposed to be\nfavorable for photodetection since in general it breaks Lorentz invariance to\nhave tilted chiral Weyl cones around Fermi level, which leads to chirality\ndependent photocurrents at arbitrarily long wavelength. Furthermore, the linear\ndispersion bands in Weyl cones result in very high carrier mobility and much\nreduced thermal carrier compared with the parabolic ones in narrow-gap\nsemiconductors. Here, we report that the Weyl semimetal TaAs based\nphotodetector can operate at room temperature with spectral range from blue\n(438.5 nm) to mid-infrared (10.29 {\\mu}m) light wavelengths and the\nresponsibility and detectivity is more than 78 uA W-1 and 1.88*107 Jones,\nrespectively. This is the first photodetector made by a Weyl semimetal and\nshows its promising in room-temperature mid-infrared photodetection.\n", "  Lowest bound S-state energy of Coulomb three-body systems ($N^{Z+}\\mu^-e^-$)\nhaving a positively charged nucleus of charge number Z ($N^{Z+}$), a negatively\ncharged muon ($\\mu^-$) and an electron ($e^-$), is investigated in the\nframework of hyperspherical harmonics expansion method. A Yukawa type Coulomb\npotential with an adjustable screening parameter ($\\lambda$) is chosen for the\n2-body subsystems. In the resulting Schr\\\"odinger equation (SE), the three-body\nrelative wave function is expanded in the complete set of hyperspherical\nharmonics (HH). Thereafter use of orthonormality of HH in the SE, led to a set\nof coupled differential equations which are solved numerically to get the\nenergy (E) of the systems investigated.\n", "  We demonstrate how one can see quantization of geometry, and quantum\nalgebraic structure in supersymmetric gauge theory.\n", "  It is shown that for the effective Lagrangian with factorization ansatz\nconsidered here, the two body hadronic decay $\\mathcal{B}_{b}(\\frac{1}{2}^+)\n\\to \\mathcal{B}(\\frac{1}{2}^{+},\\; \\frac{3}{2}^{+}) + V$, for\n$\\mathcal{B}_{b}(\\frac{1}{2}^{+})$ belonging to the representation $\\bar{3}$,\nonly allowed decay channel is $\\mathcal{B}_{b}(\\frac{1}{2}^+) \\to\n\\mathcal{B}(\\frac{1}{2}^{+})+ V$, where $\\mathcal{B}(\\frac{1}{2}^{+})$ belongs\nto the representation $8$ of $SU(3)$. However, for\n$\\mathcal{B}_{b}(\\frac{1}{2}^{+})$ belonging to the sextet representation $6$,\nthe allowed decay channels are $\\mathcal{B}_{b}(\\frac{1}{2}^+) \\to\n\\mathcal{B}(\\frac{1}{2}^{+},\\; \\frac{3}{2}^{+}) + V$, where\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\frac{1}{2}^{+})$ and $\\mathcal{B}(\\frac{3}{2}^{+})$ belongs to\nthe octet representation $8^{\\prime}$ and the decuplet $10$ of $SU(3)$,\nrespectively. The decay channel $\\mathcal{B}_{b}(\\frac{1}{2}^+) \\to\n\\mathcal{B}(\\frac{1}{2}^{+}) + V$ is analyzed in detail. The decay rate\n($\\Gamma$) and the asymmetry parameters $\\alpha\\;, \\alpha^{\\prime}\\;, \\beta\\;,\n\\gamma$ and $\\gamma^{\\prime}$ are expressed in terms of four amplitudes. In\nparticular for the decay $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda + J/\\psi$ it is shown that\nwithin the factorization framework, using heavy quark spin symmetry, the decay\nrate and the asymmetry parameters can be expressed in terms of two form factors\n$F_1$ and $F_{2}/F_{1}$, which are to be evaluated in some model. For other\nheavy quarks belonging to the triplet and sextet representation, the results\ncan be easily obtained by using $SU(3)$ symmetry and phase space factor.\nFinally, the decay $\\Omega_{b}^{-} \\to \\Omega^{-} + J/\\psi$ is analyzed within\nthe factorization framework. It is shown that the asymmetry parameter $\\alpha$\nin this particular decay is zero. The branching ratio obtained in the first\napproximation is compared with the experimental value.\n", "  Sunspot number series are composed from observations of hundreds of different\nobservers that requires careful normalization of the observers to the standard\nconditions. Here we present a new normalized series of the number of sunspot\ngroups for the period 1749-1996. The reconstruction is based on the active day\nfraction (ADF) method, which is slightly updated with respect to the previous\nworks, and a revised database of sunspot group observations. Stability of some\nkey solar observers has been evaluated against the composite series. The Royal\nGreenwich Observatory dataset appears fairly stable since the 1890s but is\nabout 10% too low before that. A declining trend of 10-15% in the quality of\nWolfer's observation is found between the 1880s and 1920s, suggesting that\nusing him as the reference observer may lead to additional uncertainties. Wolf\n(small telescope) appears fairly stable between the 1860s and 1890s, without\nany obvious trend. The new reconstruction reflects the centennial variability\nof solar activity as evaluated using the singular spectrum analysis method. It\ndepicts a highly significant feature of the Modern grand maximum of solar\nactivity in the second half of the 20th century, being a factor 1.33-1.77\nhigher than during the 18-19th centuries. The new series of the sunspot group\nnumbers with monthly and annual resolution, available also in the electronic\nformat, is provided forming a basis for new studies of the solar variability\nand solar dynamo for the last 250 years.\n", "  We report a precise experimental study on the shot noise of a quantum point\ncontact (QPC) fabricated in a GaAs/AlGaAs based high-mobility two-dimensional\nelectron gas (2DEG). The combination of unprecedented cleanliness and very high\nmeasurement accuracy has enabled us to discuss the Fano factor to characterize\nthe shot noise with a precision of 1 %. We observed that the shot noise at zero\nmagnetic field exhibits a slight enhancement exceeding the single particle\ntheoretical prediction, and that it gradually decreases as a perpendicular\nmagnetic field is applied. We also confirmed that this additional noise\ncompletely vanishes in the quantum Hall regime. These phenomena can be\nexplained by the electron heating effect near the QPC, which is suppressed with\nincreasing magnetic field.\n", "  The turbulent Rayleigh--Taylor system in a rotating reference frame is\ninvestigated by direct numerical simulations within the Oberbeck-Boussinesq\napproximation. On the basis of theoretical arguments, supported by our\nsimulations, we show that the Rossby number decreases in time, and therefore\nthe Coriolis force becomes more important as the system evolves and produces\nmany effects on Rayleigh--Taylor turbulence. We find that rotation reduces the\nintensity of turbulent velocity fluctuations and therefore the growth rate of\nthe temperature mixing layer. Moreover, in presence of rotation the conversion\nof potential energy into turbulent kinetic energy is found to be less effective\nand the efficiency of the heat transfer is reduced. Finally, during the\nevolution of the mixing layer we observe the development of a\ncyclone-anticyclone asymmetry.\n", "  The azimuthal correlation of D mesons with charged particles in pp collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV was measured using the ALICE detector at LHC. This\nmeasurement allows us to gain insight into heavy-flavour production processes\nand parton shower. The results are compared with the measurement performed in\np-Pb collisions. The yield of charged particles in the near-side correlation\npeak and the peak width measured in the two collision systems are compatible,\nwithin the uncertainties, and described by Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  By using first-principles calculation, the interaction of O2 and H2O\nmolecules with the pristine and the defective InSe monolayers is studied. It is\npredicted that the single Se and In vacancies exhibit significantly enhanced\nchemical activity toward the adsorbates compared with the perfect InSe lattice\nsite, and the Se vacancies have a much higher chemical activity than the In\nvacancies. H2O molecule should be only physisorbed on the various InSe\nmonolayers at ambient conditions, according to the calculated energies. The\ndoping of the various InSe monolayers is discussed by the physisorbed H2O. The\nvacancies show a much higher chemical activity toward O2 than H2O. Although O2\nmolecules are still physisorbed on the pristine InSe monolayer, they will be\nchemisorbed on the defective InSe monolayers. Especially, our calculated\nenergies suggest that the surface oxidation of the 2D InSe semiconductor should\nbe dominated by the defects that expose under-coordinated host atoms,\nespecially In atoms. Our theoretical results can help better understanding the\ndoping and the oxidation of the 2D InSe semiconductor under ambient conditions.\n", "  After the Higgs boson discovery, LHC can be used as a precision machine to\nexplore its properties. Indeed, in case new resonances will not be found, the\nonly access to New Physics would be via measuring small deviations from the SM\npredictions. A consistent approach is provided by a bottom-up Effective Field\nTheory, with dimension six operators built of Standard Model fields (SMEFT). We\ndiscuss how this approach works in case of the transverse momentum spectrum of\nthe Higgs particle. In our calculation we augmented the Standard Model with\nthree additional operators describing modifications of the top and bottom\nYukawa couplings, and a point-like Higgs coupling to gluons. Based on recently\npresented resummed transverse-momentum spectra including these operators at\nNLL+NLO accuracy,which we recently presented in Ref [1], in this note we show\nthe extension of the calculation to NNLL+NNLO. We find that such modifications,\nwhile affecting the total rate within the current uncertainties, can lead to\nsignificant distortions of the spectrum. Additionally, through significant\nreduction of the scale uncertainty we improve the sensitivity to the new\noperators.\n", "  The $\\textit p_{T}$-differential cross section of D mesons in the rapidity\nrange $|y|< 0.5$ was measured in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76, 7 and 8\nTeV. D mesons were reconstructed in their hadronic decay channels by means of\nthe invariant mass analysis. The D-meson production cross sections is compared\namong different energies and to pQCD calculations. Also the prompt D meson are\nstudied as a function of the multiplicity of charged articles produced in\ninelastic pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV. The\nmeasurements are compared with model calculations.\n", "  We report on the temperature stability of pseudomorphic GeSn films grown by\nmolecular beam epitaxy on Ge(001) substrates. Both the growth\ntemperature-dependence and the influence of post-growth annealing steps were\ninvestigated. In either case we observe that decomposition of metastable\nepilayers with Sn concentrations around 10% sets in above 230{\\deg}C, the\neutectic temperature of the Ge/Sn system. Time-resolved annealing experiments\nin a scanning electron microscope reveal the crucial role of liquid Sn droplets\nin this phase separation process. Driven by a gradient of the chemical\npotential, the Sn droplets move on the surface along preferential\ncrystallographic directions, thereby taking up Sn and Ge from the strained GeSn\nlayer at their leading edge. While Sn-uptake increases the volume of the melt,\ndissolved Ge becomes re-deposited by a liquid-phase epitaxial process at the\ntrailing edge of the droplet. Secondary droplets are launched from the rims of\nthe single-crystalline Ge trails into intact regions of the GeSn film, leading\nto an avalanche-like transformation front between the GeSn film and\nre-deposited Ge. This process makes phase separation of metastable GeSn layers\nparticularly efficient at rather low temperatures.\n", "  While it is well known that X-ray tomography using a polychromatic source is\nnon-linear, as the linear attenuation coefficient depends on the wavelength of\nthe X-rays, tomography using near monochromatic sources are usually assumed to\nbe a linear inverse problem. When sources and detectors are not treated as\npoints the measurements are the integrals of the exponentials of line integrals\nand hence non-linear. In this paper we show that this non-linearity can be\nobserved in realistic situations using both experimental measurements in a\ngamma-ray tomography system and simulations. We exhibit the Jacobian matrix of\nthe non-linear forward problem. We also demonstrate a reconstruction algorithm,\nwhich we apply to experimental data and we show that improved reconstructions\ncan be obtained over the linear approximation.\n", "  I present a fast Python tool, SpectRes, for carrying out the resampling of\nspectral flux densities and their associated uncertainties onto different\nwavelength grids. The function works with any grid of wavelength values,\nincluding non-uniform sampling, and preserves the integrated flux. This may be\nof use for binning data to increase the signal to noise ratio, obtaining\nsynthetic photometry, or resampling model spectra to match the sampling of\nobserved data for spectral energy distribution fitting. The function can be\ndownloaded from https://www.github.com/ACCarnall/SpectRes.\n", "  The diffraction pattern of a single non-periodic compact object, such as a\nmolecule, is continuous and is proportional to the square modulus of the\nFourier transform of that object. When arrayed in a crystal, the coherent sum\nof the continuous diffracted wave-fields from all objects gives rise to strong\nBragg peaks that modulate the single-object transform. Wilson statistics\ndescribe the distribution of continuous diffraction intensities to the same\nextent that they apply to Bragg diffraction. The continuous diffraction\nobtained from translationally-disordered molecular crystals consists of the\nincoherent sum of the wave-fields from the individual rigid units (such as\nmolecules) in the crystal, which is proportional to the incoherent sum of the\ndiffraction from the rigid units in each of their crystallographic\norientations. This sum over orientations modifies the statistics in a similar\nway that crystal twinning modifies the distribution of Bragg intensities. These\nstatistics are applied to determine parameters of continuous diffraction such\nas its scaling, the beam coherence, and the number of independent wave-fields\nor object orientations contributing. Continuous diffraction is generally much\nweaker than Bragg diffraction and may be accompanied by a background that far\nexceeds the strength of the signal. Instead of just relying upon the smallest\nmeasured intensities to guide the subtraction of the background it is shown how\nall measured values can be utilised to estimate the background, noise, and\nsignal, by employing a modified \"noisy Wilson\" distribution that explicitly\nincludes the background. Parameters relating to the background and signal\nquantities can be estimated from the moments of the measured intensities. The\nanalysis method is demonstrated on previously-published continuous diffraction\ndata measured from imperfect crystals of photosystem II.\n", "  For the Ising model on Cayley trees we give a very wide class of new Gibbs\nmeasures. We show that these new measures are extreme under some conditions on\nthe temperature. We give a review of all known Gibbs measures of the Ising\nmodel on trees and compare them with our new measures.\n", "  We present differential $UBV$ photoelectric photometry obtained by Williamon\nof the short-period A-type W~UMa binary MW~Pav. With the Wilson-Devinney\nanalysis program we obtained a simultaneous solution of these observations with\nthe $UBV$ photometry of Lapasset (1977,1980), the $V$ measurements by the\n$ASAS$ program, and the double-lined radial velocity measurements of Rucinski &\nDuerbeck (2006). Our solution indicates that MW~Pav is in an overcontact state,\nwhere both components exceed their critical Roche lobes. We derive masses of\n$M_1 = 1.514 \\pm 0.063 \\, M_\\sun$ and $M_2 = 0.327 \\pm 0.014 \\, M_\\sun$, and\nequal-volume radii of $R_1 = 2.412 \\pm 0.034 \\, R_\\sun$ and $R_2 = 1.277 \\pm\n0.019 \\, R_\\sun$ for the primary and secondary, respectively. The system is\nassumed to have a circular orbit and is seen at an inclination of $86.39\\arcdeg\n\\pm 0.63\\arcdeg$. The effective temperature of the primary was held fixed at\n$6900$~K, whereas the secondary's temperature was found to be $6969 \\pm 10$~K.\nThe asymmetry of the light curves requires a large, single star spot on the\nsmaller, less massive secondary component. A consistent base solution, with\ndifferent spot characteristics for the Williamon, Lapasset, and $ASAS$ data,\nwas found. The modeled spot varied little during the 40-year range of\nphotometric observations. The combined solution utilized a third light\ncomponent and found that the period is changing at a rate of dP/dt~=~$(6.50 \\pm\n0.19) \\times 10^{-10}$.\n", "  New results on the measurements of the hadronic final state in\nneutral-current deep-inelastic scattering at HERA are presented. A combination\nof reduced charm and beauty cross sections is presented and the masses of the\nheavy quarks are determined to $m_c=1290\\,(^{+78}_{-53})\\,{\\rm MeV}$ and\n$m_b=4049\\,(^{+138}_{-118})\\,{\\rm MeV}$. The measurement of the production of\nprompt photons accompanied by a jet provides a precise test of QCD predictions.\nMeasurements of jet production cross sections are presented and compared for\nthe first time to next-to-next-to-leading order predictions (NNLO). The strong\ncoupling constant is determined from inclusive jet and dijet production cross\nsections using NNLO predictions to $\\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1157\\,(6)_{\\rm\nexp}\\,(^{+31}_{-26})_{\\rm th}$.\n", "  Approximating the frequency dispersion of the permittivity of materials with\nsimple analytical functions is of fundamental importance for understanding and\nmodeling their optical properties. Quite generally, the permittivity can be\ntreated in the complex frequency plane as an analytic function having a\ncountable number of simple poles which determine the dispersion of the\npermittivity, with the pole weights corresponding to generalized conductivities\nof the medium at these resonances. The resulting Drude-Lorentz model separates\nthe poles at frequencies with zero real part (Ohm's law and Drude poles) from\npoles with finite real part (Lorentz poles). To find the parameters of such an\nanalytic function, we minimize the error weighted deviation between the model\nand measured values of the permittivity. We show examples of such optimizations\nfor various semiconductors (Si, GaAs and Ge), for different frequency ranges\nand up to five pairs of Lorentz poles accounted for in the model.\n", "  We propose a multi-layer approach to simulate hyperpycnal and hypopycnal\nplumes in flows with free surface. The model allows to compute the vertical\nprofile of the horizontal and the vertical components of the velocity of the\nfluid flow. The model can describe as well the vertical profile of the sediment\nconcentration and the velocity components of each one of the sediment species\nthat form the turbidity current. To do so, it takes into account the settling\nvelocity of the particles and their interaction with the fluid. This allows to\nbetter describe the phenomena than a single layer approach. It is in better\nagreement with the physics of the problem and gives promising results. The\nnumerical simulation is carried out by rewriting the multi-layer approach in a\ncompact formulation, which corresponds to a system with non-conservative\nproducts, and using path-conservative numerical scheme. Numerical results are\npresented in order to show the potential of the model.\n", "  The reentrant integer quantum Hall effects (RIQHE) are due to formation of\nelectronic crystals. We show analytically and numerically that topological\ntextures in the charge density distribution in these crystals in the vicinity\nof charged defects strongly reduce energy required for current-carrying\nexcitations. The theory quantitatively explains sharp insulator-metal\ntransitions experimentally observed in RIQHE states. The insulator to metal\ntransition in RIQHE emerges as a thermodynamic unbinding transition of\ntopological charged defects.\n", "  The near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) is not only a tool for\nimaging of objects in the sub wavelength limit but also a prominent\ncharacteristic tool for understanding the intrinsic properties of the\nnanostructures. The effect of strong localized surface plasmon resonance\nabsorption of excitation laser in the NSOM images for Au nanoparticles is\nobserved. The role of electronic transitions from different native defect\nrelated energy states of AlGaN are also discussed in understanding the NSOM\nimages for the semiconductor nanowire.\n", "  Pulse coding is an effective method to overcome the trade-off between\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution in optical-fiber sensing\nsystems based on optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR). However, the coding\ngain has not been yet fully exploited. We provide a comprehensive theoretical\nanalysis and experimental validation of the sampling criteria for\ncorrelation-coded OTDR, showing that the coding gain can be further improved by\nharnessing the oversampling. Moreover, the bandwidth-limited feature of the\nphotodetector can also be utilized to select the sampling rate so that\nadditional SNR enhancement is obtained. We believe this principle could be\napplied to any practical OTDR-based optical-fiber sensing technology, and serve\nto update existing systems based on correlation-coded OTDR in a straightforward\nmanner at a relatively low cost.\n", "  When a light scalar field with gravitational strength interacts with matter,\nthe weak equivalence principle is in general violated, leading for instance to\na violation of the universality of free fall. This has been known and tested\nfor a while. However, recent developments [Minazzoli & Hees, PRD 2016] showed\nthat a novel manifestation of the universality of free fall can appear in some\nmodels. Here we discuss this new scenario and expose how we intend to constrain\nit with INPOP ephemeris.\n", "  Biocompatible microencapsulation is of widespread interest for the targeted\ndelivery of active species in fields such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and\nagro-chemistry. Capsules obtained by the self-assembly of polymers at\ninterfaces enable the combination of responsiveness to stimuli,\nbiocompatibility and scaled up production. Here, we present a one-step method\nto produce in situ membranes at oil-water interfaces, based on the hydrogen\nbond complexation of polymers between H-bond acceptor and donor in the oil and\naqueous phases, respectively. This robust process is realized through different\nmethods, to obtain capsules of various sizes, from the micrometer scale using\nmicrofluidics or rotor-stator emulsification up to the centimeter scale using\ndrop dripping. The polymer layer exhibits unique self-healing and pH-responsive\nproperties. The membrane is viscoelastic at pH = 3, softens as pH is\nprogressively raised, and eventually dissolves above pH = 6 to release the oil\nphase. This one-step method of preparation paves the way to the production of\nlarge quantities of functional capsules.\n", "  Membrane fluidity, well-known to be essential for cell functions, is\nobviously affected by copper. However, the underlying mechanism is still far\nfrom being understood, especially on the atomic level. Here, we unexpectedly\nobserved that a decrease in phospholipid (PL) bilayer fluidity caused by Cu2+\nwas much more significant than those induced by Zn2+ and Ca2+, while a\ncomparable reduction occurred in the last two ions. This finding clearly\ndisagrees with the placement in the periodic table of Cu just next to Zn and\nfar from Ca. The physical nature was revealed to be a special attraction\nbetween Cu+ cations, which can induce a motif forming of two phospholipids\ncoupled by Cu-Cu bond (PL-diCu-PL). Namely, upon Cu2+ ion binding to a\nnegatively charged phosphate group of lipid, Cu2+ was reduced to Cu+. The\nspecial attraction of the cations then caused one Cu+ ion simultaneously\nbinding to two lipids and another Cu+, resulting in the formation of PL-diCu-PL\nstructure. In contrast, this attraction cannot occur in the cases of Zn and Ca\nions due to their electron structure. Remarkably, besides lipids, the phosphate\ngroup widely exists in other biological molecules, including DNA, RNA, ADP and\nATP, which would also induce the similar structure of Cu ions with the\nmolecules. Our findings thus provide a new view for understanding the\nbiological functions of copper and the mechanism underlying copper-related\ndiseases.\n", "  In this paper the problem is posed of the prescription of the so-called\nBoltzmann-Grad (BG) limit ($\\mathcal{L}_{BG}$) for the $N-$body system of\nsmooth hard-spheres which undergo unary, binary as well as multiple elastic\ninstantaneous collisions. The statistical description is couched in terms of\nthe Master kinetic equation, i.e., the kinetic equation which realizes the\naxiomatic \"\\textit{ab initio}\" approach to the classical statistical mechanics\nof finite hard-sphere systems recently developed (Tessarotto \\textit{et al.},\n2013-2017). The issue addressed here concerns the prescription of the BG-limit\noperator and specifically the non-commutative property of $\\mathcal{L}_{BG}$\nwith the free-streaming operator which enters the same kinetic equation.\\ It is\nshown\\ that the form of the resulting limit equation remains in principle\nnon-unique, its precise realization depending critically on the way the action\nof the same operator is prescribed. Implications for the global prescription of\nthe Boltzmann equation are pointed out.\n", "  Information Theory concepts and methodologies conform the background of how\ncommunication systems are studied and understood. They are mainly focused on\nthe source-channel-receiver problem and on the asymptotic limits of accuracy\nand communication rates, which are the classical problems studied by Shannon.\nHowever, the impact of Information Theory on networks (acting as the channel)\nis just starting. Here, we present an approach to understand how information\nflows in any connected complex network. Our approach is based on defining\nlinear conservative flows that travel through the network from source to\nreceiver. This framework allows us to have an analytical description of the\nproblem and also linking the topological invariants of the network, such as the\nnode degree, with the information flow. In particular, our approach is able to\ndeal with information transmission in modular networks (networks containing\ncommunity structures) or multiplex networks (networks with multiple layers),\nwhich are nowadays of paramount importance.\n", "  The behavior of matter near a quantum critical point (QCP) is one of the most\nexciting and challenging areas of physics research. Emergent phenomena such as\nhigh-temperature superconductivity are linked to the proximity to a QCP.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in understanding quantum critical\nbehavior in some low dimensional magnetic insulators, the situation in metallic\nsystems is much less clear. Here we demonstrate that NiCoCrx single crystal\nalloys are remarkable model systems for investigating QCP physics in a metallic\nenvironment. For NiCoCrx alloys with x = 0.8, the critical exponents associated\nwith a ferromagnetic quantum critical point (FQCP) are experimentally\ndetermined from low temperature magnetization and heat capacity measurements.\nFor the first time, all of the five critical exponents ( gamma-subT =1/2 ,\nbeta-subT = 1, delta = 3/2, nuz-subm = 2, alpha-bar-subT = 0) are in remarkable\nagreement with predictions of Belitz-Kirkpatrick-Vojta (BKV) theory in the\nasymptotic limit of high disorder. Using these critical exponents, excellent\nscaling of the magnetization data is demonstrated with no adjustable\nparameters. We also find a divergence of the magnetic Gruneisen parameter,\nconsistent with a FQCP. This work therefore demonstrates that entropy\nstabilized concentrated solid solutions represent a unique platform to study\nquantum critical behavior in a highly tunable class of materials.\n", "  We report on the self-assembly of inverse patchy colloids (IPC) using Monte\nCarlo simulations in two-dimensions. The IPC model considered in this work\ncorresponds to either bipolar colloids or colloids decorated with complementary\nDNA on their surfaces, where only patch and non-patch parts attract. The patch\ncoverage is found to be a dominant factor in deciding equilibrium\nself-assembled structures. In particular, both regular square and triangular\ncrystals are found to be stable at 0.5 patch coverage. Upon decreasing the\npatch coverage to 0.33, the regular square crystal is destablized; instead\nrhombic and triangular crystals are found to be stable. At low patch coverages\nsuch as 0.22 and 0.12, only triangular crystal is stabilized at high density.\nParticles of all the patch coverages show kinetically stable cluster phases of\ndifferent shape and size, and the average cluster sizes are found to strongly\ndepend on the patch coverage and particle density. State-diagrams showing all\nthe stable phases for each patch coverage are presented. Ordered phases are\ncharacterized by bond order parameters {\\psi}4, {\\psi}6 and radial distribution\nfunction. The effect on patch coverage on polarization of the stable structures\nare also studied. The study demonstrates that inverse patchy colloids are\npotential candidates to form various ordered two-dimensional structures by\ntuning the size of the patch.\n", "  This is a continuation and completion of the program (initiated in\n\\cite{GrN1,GrN2}) to derive pointwise estimates on the Green function and sharp\nbounds on the semigroup of linearized Navier-Stokes around a generic stationary\nboundary layer profile. This is done via a spectral analysis approach and a\ncareful study of the Orr-Sommerfeld equations, or equivalently the\nNavier-Stokes resolvent operator $(\\lambda - L)^{-1}$. The earlier work\n(\\cite{GrN1,GrN2}) treats the Orr-Sommerfeld equations away from critical\nlayers: this is the case when the phase velocity is away from the range of the\nbackground profile or when $\\lambda$ is away from the Euler continuous\nspectrum. In this paper, we study the critical case: the Orr-Sommerfeld\nequations near critical layers, providing pointwise estimates on the Green\nfunction as well as carefully studying the Dunford's contour integral near the\ncritical layers.\n  As an application, we obtain pointwise estimates on the Green function and\nsharp bounds on the semigroup of the linearized Navier-Stokes problem near\nmonotonic boundary layers that are spectrally stable to the Euler equations,\ncomplementing \\cite{GrN1,GrN2} where unstable profiles are considered.\n", "  Two basic features of assemblages of unicellular plankton: (1) their high\nbiodiversity and (2) the power-law structure of their abundance, can be\nexplained by an allometric scaling of cell growth and mortality with respect to\ncell size. To show this, we describe a numerical study of a size-structured,\nmultispecies, population-dynamic model; the model has a single resource,\nsupporting an arbitrary number of phytoplankton and zooplankton species. If the\nnumber of plankton species is large enough, the death rate of prey and cell\ngrowth rate of predators have approximate allometric scalings with cell size.\nTogether, these scalings give rise to an equilibrium distribution of abundance\nnear the power law, on which many species can coexist. Scalings of this kind\ncannot be achieved if the number of species is small. This suggests that the\nconjunction of species-richness and power-law structures in plankton\ncommunities is more than a coincidence. Although the exact allometric scalings\nused here should not be expected in practice, exclusion of species should be\nrelatively slow if they lie close to the power law. Thus the forces needed to\nachieve coexistence could be effective, even if they are relatively weak.\n", "  Galactic orbits have been constructed over long time intervals for ten\nglobular clusters located near the Galactic center. A model with an axially\nsymmetric gravitational potential for the Galaxy was initially applied, after\nwhich a non-axially symmetric potential corresponding to the central bar was\nadded. Variations in the trajectories of all these globular clusters in the XY\nplane due to the influence of the bar were detected. These were greatest for\nthe cluster Terzan 4 in the meridional (RZ) plane. The globular clusters Terzan\n1, Terzan 2, Terzan 4, Terzan 9, NGC 6522, and NGC 6558 always remained within\nthe Galactic bulge, no farther than 4 kpc from the Galactic center.\n", "  This review compiles the results of recent studies of molecular gas\nconditions in the central six hundred parsecs of our Galaxy. The review begins\nby placing our Galactic center into context with the rest of our galaxy. It\nnext discusses the wealth of previous research on the Galactic center, before\nfocusing on what is known about the molecular interstellar medium in this\nregion. It focuses especially on a surge in interest in this region and new\nstudies conducted in the last five years. It concludes by highlighting open\nquestions that remain, and the potential for new facilities such as ALMA to\nmake progress in resolving these uncertainties.\n", "  We present results for non-adiabatic single-parameter pumping in a ballistic\ngraphene field-effect transistor. We investigate how scattering from an\nac-driven top gate results in dc charge current from source to drain in an\nasymmetric setup caused either by geometry of the device or different doping of\nleads. Charge current is computed using Floquet scattering matrix approach in\nLandauer-B\\\"uttiker operator formalism. We single out two mechanisms\ncontributing to the pumped current: Fabry-P\\'erot interference in open channels\nand quasibound state resonant scattering through closed channels. We identify\ntwo distinct parameter regimes based on the quasibound state scattering\nmechanism: high and low doping of contacts compared to the frequency of the ac\ndrive. We show that the latter regime results in a stronger peak pump current.\nWe discuss how back gate potential and temperature dependence can be used to\nchange the direction of the pumped current, operating the device as a switch.\n", "  For the purpose of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) of Reynolds-Averaged\nNavier-Stokes closures, we introduce a framework in which perturbations in the\neigenvalues of the anisotropy tensor are made in order to bound a\nQuantity-of-Interest based on limiting states of turbulence. To make the\nperturbations representative of local flow features, we introduce two\nadditional transport equations for linear combinations of these aforementioned\neigenvalues. The location, magnitude and direction of the eigenvalue\nperturbations are now governed by the model transport equations. The general\nbehavior of our discrepancy model is determined by two coefficients, resulting\nin a low-dimensional UQ problem. We will furthermore show that the behavior of\nthe model is intuitive and rooted in the physical interpretation of\nmisalignment between the mean strain and Reynolds stresses.\n", "  Recent progress in very high energy (VHE, E >100 GeV) $\\gamma$-ray\nobservations, together with advances in the extragalactic background light\n(EBL) modelling, allows to search for new phenomena such as $\\gamma$-axion-like\nparticle ($\\gamma \\rightarrow$ ALP) oscillation and to explore the\nextragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) strength and structure. These studies are\nusually performed by searching for some deviation from the so-called\nabsorption-only model, that accounts for only primary photon absorption on the\nEBL and adiabatic losses. In fact, there exist several indications that the\nabsorption-only model is incomplete. We present and discuss the intergalactic\nelectromagnetic cascade model (IECM) --- the simplest model that allows to\ncoherently explain all known anomalies. This model has a number of robust\nsignatures that could be searched for with present and future instruments. The\nIECM model may serve as a new background template, allowing to make future\nsearches for $\\gamma \\rightarrow$ ALP oscillation more robust. A detailed\naccount of our calculations is available in astro-ph/1609.01013v2 (A\\&A,in\nprint).\n", "  In this note, we provide evidence for new (super) moonshines relating the\nMonster and the Baby monster to some weakly holomorphic weight 1/2 modular\nforms defined by Zagier in his work on traces of singular moduli. They are\nsimilar in spirit to the recently discovered Thompson moonshine.\n", "  A lateral interface connecting two regions with different strengths of the\nBychkov-Rashba spin-orbit interaction can be used as a spin polarizer of\nelectrons in two dimensional semiconductor heterostructures. [Khodas \\emph{et\nal.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{92}, 086602 (2004)]. In this paper we consider\nthe case when one of the two regions is ballistic, while the other one is\ndiffusive. We generalize the technique developed for the solution of the\nproblem of the diffuse emission to the case of the spin dependent scattering at\nthe interface, and determine the distribution of electrons emitted from the\ndiffusive region. It is shown that the diffuse emission is an effective way to\nget electrons propagating at small angles to the interface that are most\nappropriate for the spin filtration and a subsequent spin manipulation.\nFinally, a scheme is proposed of a spin filter device, see Fig. 9, that creates\ntwo almost fully spin-polarized beams of electrons.\n", "  The recently measured spin susceptibility of the two dimensional electron gas\nexhibits a strong dependence on temperature, which is incompatible with the\nstandard Fermi liquid phenomenology. Here we show that the observed temperature\nbehavior is inherent to ballistic two dimensional electrons. Besides the\nsingle-particle and collective excitations, the thermodynamics of Fermi liquid\nsystems includes effects of the branch-cut singularities originating from the\nedges of the continuum of pairs of quasiparticles. As a result of the\nrescattering induced by interactions, the branch-cut singularities generate\nnon-analyticities in the thermodynamic potential which reveal themselves in\nanomalous temperature dependences. Calculation of the spin susceptibility in\nsuch a situation requires a non-perturbative treatment of the interactions. As\nin high-energy physics, a mixture of the collective excitations and pairs of\nquasiparticles can be effectively described by a pole in the complex momentum\nplane. This analysis provides a natural explanation for the observed\ntemperature dependence of the spin susceptibility, both in sign and magnitude.\n"]}
