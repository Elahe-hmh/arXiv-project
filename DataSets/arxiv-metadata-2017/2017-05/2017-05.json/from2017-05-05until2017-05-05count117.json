Furthermore they are also a useful tool in quantum\nShannon theory. It is known that some extractor constructions are quantum-proof\nwhereas others are provably not [Gavinsky et al., STOC'07]. We argue that the\ntheory of operator spaces offers a natural framework for studying to what\nextent extractors are secure against quantum adversaries: we first phrase the\ndefinition of extractors as a bounded norm condition between normed spaces, and\nthen show that the presence of quantum adversaries corresponds to a completely\nbounded norm condition between operator spaces. From this we show that very\nhigh min-entropy extractors as well as extractors with small output are always\n(approximately) quantum-proof. We also study a generalization of extractors\ncalled randomness condensers. We phrase the definition of condensers as a\nbounded norm condition and the definition of quantum-proof condensers as a\ncompletely bounded norm condition. Seeing condensers as bipartite graphs, we\nthen find that the bounded norm condition corresponds to an instance of a well\nstudied combinatorial problem, called bipartite densest subgraph. Furthermore,\nusing the characterization in terms of operator spaces, we can associate to any\ncondenser a Bell inequality (two-player game) such that classical and quantum\nstrategies are in one-to-one correspondence with classical and quantum attacks\non the condenser. Hence, we get for every quantum-proof condenser (which\nincludes in particular quantum-proof extractors) a Bell inequality that can not\nbe violated by quantum mechanics.\n", "  In his 2005 review, Gravity and the Thermodynamics of Horizons, Paddy\nsuggested that a vacuum in thermal equilibrium with a bath of radiation should\nhave a gradually diminishing energy. We work through the consequences of this\nscenario, and find that a coupling between the vacuum and a bath of black-body\nradiation at the temperature of the horizon requires the Hubble rate, $H$, to\napproach the same type of evolution as in the \"intermediate inflation\"\nscenario, with $H\\propto t^{-1/3}$, rather than as a constant. We show that\nsuch behaviour does not conflict with observations when the vacuum energy is\ndescribed by a slowly-rolling scalar field, and when the fluctuations in the\nscalar field are treated as in the \"warm inflation\" scenario. It does, however,\nchange the asymptotic states of the universe. We find that the existence of the\nradiation introduces a curvature singularity at early times, where the energy\ndensities in both the radiation and the vacuum diverge. Furthermore, we show\nthat the introduction of an additional non-interacting perfect fluid into the\nspace-time reveals that radiation can dominate over dust at late times, in\ncontrast to what occurs in the standard cosmological model. Such a coupling can\nalso lead to a negative vacuum energy becoming positive.\n", "  After reviewing the interpretation of laser operation as a non-equilibrium\nBose-Einstein condensation phase transition, we illustrate the novel features\narising from the non-equilibrium nature of photon and polariton Bose-Einstein\ncondensates recently observed in experiments. We then proposea quantitative\ncriterion to experimentally assess the equilibrium vs. non-equilibrium nature\nof a specific condensation process, based on fluctuation-dissipation relations.\nThe power of this criterion is illustrated on two models which shows very\ndifferent behaviours.\n", "  We have developed an approach to calculate the single-particle Green function\nof a one-dimensional many-body system in the strongly localized limit at zero\ntemperature. Our approach, based on the locator expansion, sums the\ncontributions of all possible forward scattering paths in configuration space.\nWe demonstrate for fermions that the Green function factorizes when the system\ncan be splited into two non interacting regions. This implies that for nearest\nneighbors interactions the Green function factorizes at every link connecting\ntwo sites with the same occupation. As a consequence we show that the\nconductance distribution function for interacting systems is log-normal, in the\nsame universality class as for non-interacting systems. We have developed a\nnumerical procedure to calculate the ground state and the Green function,\ngenerating all possible paths in configuration space. We compare the\nlocalization length computed with our procedure with the one obtained via exact\ndiagonalization. The latter smoothly converges to our results as the disorder\nincreases.\n", "  In absence of currents and charges the quantized electromagnetic field can be\ndescribed by wave functions which for each individual wave vector are\nnormalized to one. The resulting formalism involves reducible representations\nof the Canonical Commutation Relations. The corresponding paradigm is a\nspace-time filled with two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators.\nMathematically, this is equivalent with two additional dimensions penetrated by\nthe electromagnetic waves.\n", "  For the spherical Laplacian on the sphere and for the Dirichlet Laplacian in\nthe square}, Antonie Stern claimed in her PhD thesis (1924) the existence of an\ninfinite sequence of eigenvalues whose corresponding eigenspaces contain an\neigenfunction with exactly two nodal domains. These results were given complete\nproofs respectively by Hans Lewy in 1977, and the authors in 2014 (see also\nGauthier-Shalom--Przybytkowski, 2006). In this paper, we obtain similar results\nfor the two dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. In the opposite\ndirection, we construct an infinite sequence of regular eigenfunctions with as\nmany nodal domains as allowed by Courant's theorem, up to a factor\n$\\frac{1}{4}$. A classical question for a $2$-dimensional bounded domain is to\nestimate the length of the nodal set of a Dirichlet eigenfunction in terms of\nthe square root of the energy. In the last section, we consider some\nSchr{\\\"o}dinger operators $-\\Delta + V$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and we provide bounds\nfor the length of the nodal set of an eigenfunction with energy $\\lambda$ in\nthe classically permitted region $\\{V(x) < \\lambda\\}$.\n", "  We present the first constraints on cosmology from the Dark Energy Survey\n(DES), using weak lensing measurements from the preliminary Science\nVerification (SV) data. We use 139 square degrees of SV data, which is less\nthan 3\\% of the full DES survey area. Using cosmic shear 2-point measurements\nover three redshift bins we find $\\sigma_8 (\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.81\n\\pm 0.06$ (68\\% confidence), after marginalising over 7 systematics parameters\nand 3 other cosmological parameters. We examine the robustness of our results\nto the choice of data vector and systematics assumed, and find them to be\nstable. About $20$\\% of our error bar comes from marginalising over shear and\nphotometric redshift calibration uncertainties. The current state-of-the-art\ncosmic shear measurements from CFHTLenS are mildly discrepant with the\ncosmological constraints from Planck CMB data; our results are consistent with\nboth datasets. Our uncertainties are $\\sim$30\\% larger than those from CFHTLenS\nwhen we carry out a comparable analysis of the two datasets, which we attribute\nlargely to the lower number density of our shear catalogue. We investigate\nconstraints on dark energy and find that, with this small fraction of the full\nsurvey, the DES SV constraints make negligible impact on the Planck\nconstraints. The moderate disagreement between the CFHTLenS and Planck values\nof $\\sigma_8 (\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$ is present regardless of the value of\n$w$.\n", "  We analyze the numerical solutions of a stochastic Arctic sea ice model with\nmultiplicative noise over a wide range of external heat-fluxes, $\\Delta F_0$,\nwhich correspond to greenhouse gas forcing. When the noise is multiplicative,\nthe noise-magnitude depends on the state-variable, and this will influence the\nstatistical moments in a manner that differs from the additive case, which we\nanalyzed in Part I of this study. The state variable describing the\ndeterministic backbone of our model is the energy, $E(t)$, contained in the ice\nor the ocean and for a thorough comparison and contrast we choose the simplest\nform of multiplicative noise $\\sigma E(t) \\xi(t)$, where $\\sigma$ is the noise\namplitude and $\\xi(t)$ is the noise process. The case of constant additive\nnoise (CA) we write as $\\sigma\\overline{E_S}\\xi(t)$, in which $\\overline{E_S}$\nis the seasonally averaged value of the periodic deterministic steady-state\nsolution $E_S(t)$, or the deterministic seasonal cycle. We then treat the case\nof seasonally-varying additive noise (SVA), $\\sigma E_S(t) \\xi(t)$, as well as\ntwo types of multiplicative noise that depend on the form of stochastic\ncalculus (It\\^{o} or Stratonovich) used to interpret the noise itself. The\ncomparison of these four cases reveals the stochastic anatomy of the system\nover the entire range of the $\\Delta F_0$ from the perennial ice states to near\nthe ice-free state.\n", "  We analyze the numerical solutions of a stochastic Arctic sea ice model with\nconstant additive noise over a wide range of external heat-fluxes, $\\Delta\nF_0$, which correspond to greenhouse gas forcing. The variability that the\nstochasticity provides to the deterministic steady state solutions (perennial\nand seasonal ice states) is illustrated by examining both the stochastic paths\nand probability density functions (PDFs). The principal stochastic moments\n(standard deviation, mean and skewness) are calculated and compared with those\ndetermined from a stochastic perturbation theory described previously by Moon\nand Wettlaufer (2013). We examine in detail the competing roles of the\ndestabilizing sea ice-albedo-feedback and the stabilizing long-wave radiative\nloss contributions to the variability of the ice cover under increased\ngreenhouse-gas forcing. In particular, the variability of the stochastic paths\nat the end of summer shows a clear maximum, which is due to the combination of\nthe increasing importance of the albedo-feedback and its associated \"memory\neffect\" that accumulates from early spring to late summer. This is\ncounterbalanced by the stabilization of the ice cover due to the longwave loss\nof energy from the ice surface, which is enhanced during winter, thereby\nfocusing the stochastic paths and decreasing the variability in winter. The\norganizing principle for the interpretation of these effects is a generalized\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process with a time dependent potential.\n", "  We present a consistent thermodynamic theory for the resonant level model in\nthe wide band limit, whose level energy is driven slowly by an external force.\nThe problem of defining 'system' and 'bath' in the strong coupling regime is\ncircumvented by considering as the 'system' everything that is influenced by\nthe externally driven level. The thermodynamic functions that are obtained to\nfirst order beyond the quasistatic limit fulfill the first and second law with\na positive entropy production, successfully connect to the forces experienced\nby the external driving, and reproduce the correct weak coupling limit of\nstochastic thermodynamics.\n", "  Using Matrix theory, we propose a technique on how to compute the entangle-\nment entropy between a supergravity probe and modes on a spherical membrane. We\ndemonstrate that a membrane stretched between the probe and the sphere\nentangles these modes and can lead to an the entanglement entropy that encodes\ninformation about local gravitational geometry seen by the probe.\n", "  The neutrino asymmetry in the early universe plasma, $n_\\nu - n_{\\bar \\nu}$,\nis calculated both before and after the electroweak phase transition (EWPT).\nThe leptogenesis before EWPT within the standard model is well known to be\ndriven by the abelian anomaly in a massless hypercharge field. The generation\nof the neutrino asymmetry in the Higgs phase after EWPT, in its turn, has not\nbeen considered previously because of the absence of any quantum anomaly in an\nexternal electromagnetic field for such electroneutral particles as neutrino,\nunlike the Adler anomaly for charged left and right polarized massless\nelectrons in the same electromagnetic field. Using the neutrino Boltzmann\nequation, modified by the Berry curvature term in the momentum space, we\nestablish the violation of the macroscopic neutrino current in plasma after\nEWPT and exactly reproduce the nonconservation of the lepton current in the\nsymmetric phase before EWPT arising in quantum field theory due to the non-zero\nlepton hypercharge and corresponding triangle anomaly in an external\nhypercharge field. In the last case the violation of the lepton current is\nderived through the kinetic approach without the computation of the\ncorresponding Feynman diagrams. Then the new kinetic equation is applied for\nthe calculation of the neutrino asymmetry accounting for the the Berry\ncurvature and the electroweak interaction with background fermions in the Higgs\nphase, including the stage after the neutrino decoupling at the absence of\nneutrino collisions in plasma. This asymmetry is found to be rather small to be\nobserved. Thus, a difference of the relic neutrino and antineutrino densities,\nif exists, should be acquired mainly in the symmetric phase before EWPT.\n", "  Many situations require people to act quickly and are characterized by\nasymmetric information. Since asymmetric information makes people tempted to\nmisreport their private information for their own benefit, it is of primary\nimportance to understand whether time pressure affects honest behavior. A\ntheory of social heuristics (the Social Heuristics Hypothesis, SHH), predicts\nthat, in case of one-shot interactions, such an effect exists and it is\npositive. The SHH proposes that when people have no time to evaluate all\navailable alternatives, they tend to rely on heuristics, choices that are\noptimal in everyday, repeated interactions and that have been internalized over\ntime; and then, after deliberation, people shift their behavior towards the one\nthat is optimal in the given interaction. Thus, the SHH predicts that time\npressure increases honesty in one-shot interactions (because honesty may be\noptimal in repeated interactions, while dishonesty is always optimal in the\nshort run). However, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental studies have\ntested this prediction. Here, I report a large (N=1,013) study aimed at filling\nthis gap. In this study, participants were given a private information and were\nasked to report it within 5 seconds vs after 30 seconds. The interaction was\none-shot, and payoffs were such that subjects had an incentive to lie. As\npredicted by the SHH, I find that time pressure increases honest behavior. In\ndoing so, these results provide new insights on the role of time pressure on\nhonesty, and provide one more piece of evidence in support of the Social\nHeuristics Hypothesis.\n", "  We discuss the low-energy physics of the three-orbital Anderson impurity\nmodel with the Coulomb interaction term of the Kanamori form which has orbital\nSO(3) and spin SU(2) symmetry and describes systems with partially occupied\n$t_{2g}$ shells. We focus on the case with two electrons in the impurity that\nis relevant to Hund's metals. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation we\nderive an effective Kondo model with couplings between the bulk and impurity\nelectrons expressed in terms of spin, orbital, and orbital quadrupole\noperators. The bare spin-spin Kondo interaction is much smaller than the\norbit-orbit and spin-orbital couplings or is even ferromagnetic. Furthermore,\nthe perturbative scaling equations indicate faster renormalization of the\ncouplings related to orbital degrees of freedom compared to spin degrees of\nfreedom. Both mechanisms lead to a slow screening of the local spin moment. The\nmodel thus behaves similarly to the related quantum impurity problem with a\nlarger SU(3) orbital symmetry (Dworin-Narath interaction) where this was first\nobserved. We find that the two problems actually describe the same low-energy\nphysics since the SU(3) symmetry is dynamically established through the\nrenormalization of the splittings of coupling constants to zero. The\nperturbative renormalization group results are corroborated with the\nnumerical-renormalization group (NRG) calculations. The dependence of spin\nKondo temperatures and orbital Kondo temperatures as a function of interaction\nparameters, the hybridization, and the impurity occupancy is calculated and\ndiscussed.\n", "  We consider a model of self-propelled dynamics for athermal active particles,\nwhere the non-equilibrium active forces are modelled by a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess. In the limit of no-driving force, the model reduces to the passive,\nBrownian dynamics of an atomistic glass forming fluid, the Wahnstr\\\"om binary\nmixture. The Wahnstr\\\"om mixture is known to show strong correlations between\nthe emergence of slow dynamics and the formation of locally favoured structures\nbased on icosahedra. Here, we study how the non-equilibrium forces affect the\nlocal structure of the system, and find that these strongly promote icosahedral\norder. The phases rich in local icosahedral order correspond to configurations\nof very low potential energy, suggesting that the non-equilibrium dynamics in\nthe self propelled model can be effectively exploited to explore the potential\nenergy surface of the binary mixture and have access to states that are\ndifficult to attain using passive dynamics.\n", "  We show that ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions at the LHC can be used to\nsearch for axion-like particles with mass below 100 GeV. The $Z^4$ enhanced\nphoton-photon luminosity from the ions provides a large exclusive production\nrate, with a signature of a resonant pair of back-to-back photons and no other\nactivity in the detector. In addition, we present both new and updated limits\nfrom recasting multi-photon searches at LEP II and the LHC, which are more\nstringent than those currently in the literature for the mass range 100 MeV to\n100 GeV.\n", "  We present numerical tests and predictions of the KrkNLO method for matching\nof NLO QCD corrections to hard processes with LO parton shower Monte Carlo\ngenerators (NLO+PS). This method was described in detail in our previous\npublications, where it was also compared with other NLO+PS matching approaches\n(MC@NLO and POWHEG) as well as fixed-order NLO and NNLO calculations. Here we\nconcentrate on presenting some numerical results (cross sections and\ndistributions) for $Z/\\gamma^*$ (Drell-Yan) and Higgs-boson production\nprocesses at the LHC. The Drell--Yan process is used mainly to validate the\nKrkNLO implementation in the Herwig 7 program with respect to the previous\nimplementation in Sherpa. We also show predictions for this process with the\nnew, complete, MC-scheme parton distribution functions and compare them with\nour previously published results. Then, we present the first results of the\nKrkNLO method for Higgs production in gluon-gluon fusion at the LHC and compare\nthem with MC@NLO and POWHEG predictions from Herwig 7 fixed-order results from\nHNNLO and a resummed calculation from HqT, as well as with experimental data\nfrom the ATLAS collaboration.\n", "  The models in statistical physics such as an Ising model offer a convenient\nway to characterize stationary activity of neural populations. Such stationary\nactivity of neurons may be expected for recordings from in vitro slices or\nanesthetized animals. However, modeling activity of cortical circuitries of\nawake animals has been more challenging because both spike-rates and\ninteractions can change according to sensory stimulation, behavior, or an\ninternal state of the brain. Previous approaches modeling the dynamics of\nneural interactions suffer from computational cost; therefore, its application\nwas limited to only a dozen neurons. Here by introducing multiple analytic\napproximation methods to a state-space model of neural population activity, we\nmake it possible to estimate dynamic pairwise interactions of up to 60 neurons.\nMore specifically, we applied the pseudolikelihood approximation to the\nstate-space model, and combined it with the Bethe or TAP mean-field\napproximation to make the sequential Bayesian estimation of the model\nparameters possible. The large-scale analysis allows us to investigate dynamics\nof macroscopic properties of neural circuitries underlying stimulus processing\nand behavior. We show that the model accurately estimates dynamics of network\nproperties such as sparseness, entropy, and heat capacity by simulated data,\nand demonstrate utilities of these measures by analyzing activity of monkey V4\nneurons as well as a simulated balanced network of spiking neurons.\n", "  We discuss a simple model of particles hopping in one dimension with\nattractive interactions. Taking a hydrodynamic limit in which the interaction\nstrength increases with the system size, we observe the formation of multiple\nclusters of particles, each containing a finite fraction of the all the\nparticles in the system. These clusters are correlated in space, and the system\nhas a self-similar (fractal) structure. These results are related to\ncondensation phenomena in mass transport models and to a recent mathematical\nanalysis of the hydrodynamic limit in a related model.\n", "  Total reaction cross sections of deuteron, $\\sigma_d^{\\rm R}$, are calculated\nby a microscopic three-body reaction model. The reaction model has no free\nadjustable parameter and applicable to reactions at various deuteron incident\nenergies $E_d$ and with both stable and unstable nuclei. The predicted\n$\\sigma_d^{\\rm R}$ are consistent with those evaluated by a phenomenological\noptical potential for $E_d\\leq 200$ MeV in which the potential has been\nparametrized. A simple formula of $\\sigma_d^{\\rm R}$ up to $E_d=1$ GeV, as a\nfunction of $E_d$, the target mass number $A$ and its atomic number $Z$, is\ngiven.\n", "  Interpreting RG flows as dynamical systems in the space of couplings we\nproduce a variety of constraints, global (topological) as well as local. These\nconstraints, in turn, rule out some of the proposed RG flows and also predict\nnew phases and fixed points, surprisingly, even in familiar theories such as\nO(N) model, QED-3, or QCD-4.\n", "  Using liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) technique (111) yttrium iron garnet (YIG)\nfilms with thicknesses of ~100 nm and surface roughnesses as low as 0.3 nm have\nbeen grown as a basic material for spin-wave propagation experiments in\nmicrostructured waveguides. The continuously strained films exhibit nearly\nperfect crystallinity without significant mosaicity and with effective lattice\nmisfits of delta a(perpendicular)/a(substrate) ~10-4 and below. The\nfilm/substrate interface is extremely sharp without broad interdiffusion layer\nformation. All LPE films exhibit a nearly bulk-like saturation magnetization of\n(1800+-20) Gs and an `easy cone' anisotropy type with extremely small in-plane\ncoercive fields <0.2 Oe. There is a rather weak in-plane magnetic anisotropy\nwith a pronounced six-fold symmetry observed for saturation field <1.5 Oe. No\nsignificant out-of-plane anisotropy is observed, but a weak dependence of the\neffective magnetization on the lattice misfit is detected. The narrowest\nferromagnetic resonance linewidth is determined to be 1.4 Oe @ 6.5 GHz which is\nthe lowest value reported so far for YIG films of 100 nm thicknesses and below.\nThe Gilbert damping coefficient for investigated LPE films is estimated to be\nclose to 1 x 10-4.\n", "  Advances in light sources and time resolved spectroscopy have made it\npossible to excite specific atomic vibrations in solids and to observe the\nresulting changes in electronic properties but the mechanism by which phonon\nexcitation causes qualitative changes in electronic properties, has remained\nunclear. Here we show that the dominant symmetry-allowed coupling between\nelectron density and dipole active modes implies an electron density-dependent\nsqueezing of the phonon state which provides an attractive contribution to the\nelectron-electron interaction, independent of the sign of the bare\nelectron-phonon coupling and with a magnitude proportional to the degree of\nlaser-induced phonon excitation. Reasonable excitation amplitudes lead to\nnon-negligible attractive interactions that may cause significant transient\nchanges in electronic properties including superconductivity. The mechanism is\ngenerically applicable to a wide range of systems, offering a promising route\nto manipulating and controlling electronic phase behavior in novel materials.\n", "  We present an updated global model of the solar corona, including the\ntransition region. We simulate the realistic tree-dimensional (3D) magnetic\nfield using the data from the photospheric magnetic field measurements and\nassume the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Alfv\\'en wave turbulence and its\nnon-linear dissipation to be the only source for heating the coronal plasma and\ndriving the solar wind. In closed field regions the dissipation efficiency in a\nbalanced turbulence is enhanced. In the coronal holes we account for a\nreflection of the outward propagating waves, which is accompanied by generation\nof weaker counter-propagating waves. The non-linear cascade rate degrades in\nstrongly imbalanced turbulence, thus resulting in colder coronal holes.\n  The distinctive feature of the presented model is the description of the low\ncorona as almost-steady-state low-beta plasma motion and heat flux transfer\nalong the magnetic field lines. We trace the magnetic field lines through each\ngrid point of the lower boundary of the global corona model, chosen at some\nheliocentric distance, $R=R_{b}\\sim1.1\\ R_\\odot$ well above the transition\nregion. One can readily solve the plasma parameters along the magnetic field\nline from 1D equations for the plasma motion and heat transport together with\nthe Alfv\\'en wave propagation, which adequately describe physics within the\nheliocentric distances range, $R_{\\odot}<R<R_{b}$, in the low solar corona. By\ninterfacing this threaded-field-lines model with the full MHD global corona\nmodel at $r=R_{b}$, we find the global solution and achieve a\nfaster-than-real-time performance of the model on $\\sim200$ cores.\n", "  We study the impact of dimension-six operators of the standard model\neffective field theory relevant for vector-boson fusion and associated Higgs\nboson production at the LHC. We present predictions at the next-to-leading\norder accuracy in QCD that include matching to parton showers and that rely on\nfully automated simulations. We show the importance of the subsequent reduction\nof the theoretical uncertainties in improving the possible discrimination\nbetween effective field theory and standard model results, and we demonstrate\nthat the range of the Wilson coefficient values allowed by a global fit to LEP\nand LHC Run~I data can be further constrained by LHC Run~II future results.\n", "  We reveal an edge spin triplet $p-$wave superconducting pairing correlation\nin slightly doped zigzag graphene nanoribbons. By employing a method that\ncombines random-phase approximation, the finite-temperature determinant quantum\nMonte Carlo approach, and the ground-state constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo\nmethod, it is shown that such a spin-triplet pairing is mediated by the\nferromagnetic fluctuations caused by the flat band at the edge. The spin\nsusceptibility and effective pairing interactions at the edge strongly increase\nas the on-site Coulomb interaction increases, indicating the importance of\nelectron-electron correlations. It is also found that the doping-dependent\nground-state $p$-wave pairing correlation bears some similarity to the famous\nsuperconducting dome in the phase diagram of a high-temperature superconductor,\nwhile the spin correlation at the edge is weakened as the system is doped away\nfrom half filling.\n", "  We present a review on the progress in the understanding and characterization\nof holonomy and topology of a discrete-time quantum walk architecture,\nconsisting of a unitary step given by a sequence of two non-commuting rotations\nin parameter space \\cite{Puentesarxiv}. Unlike other similar systems recently\nstudied in detail in the literature, this system does not present continous 1D\ntopological boundaries, it only presents a discrete number of Dirac points\nwhere the quasi- energy gap closes. At these discrete points the topological\nwinding number is not defined. Therefore, such discrete points represent\ntopological boundaries of dimension zero, and they endow the system with a\nnon-trivial topology. We illustrate the non-trivial character of the system by\ncalculating the Zak phase. We also propose a suitable experimental scheme to\nimplement these ideas, and we present preliminary experimental data.\n", "  Phase transition of iron, as a prototype of martensite phase transition under\ndynamic loadings, exhibits huge diverges in its TP among experiments with\ndifferent pressure medium and loading rates, even in the same initial samples.\nGreat achievements are made in understanding strain or stress dependence of the\nTP under dynamic loadings. However, present understandings on the strain rate\ndependence of the TP are far from clear, even a virgin for extreme high strain\nrates. In this work, large scale NEMD simulations are conducted to study the\neffects of strain rates on the phase transition of iron-based single crystals.\nOur results show that the phase transition is preceded by lattice instabilities\nunder ramp compressions, but present theory, represented by modified Born\ncriteria, cannot correctly predict observed onsets of the instability. Through\nconsidering both strain and strain gradient disturbances, new instability\ncriteria are proposed, which could be generally applied for studying\ninstabilities under either static or dynamic loadings. For the ramp with a\nstrain rate smaller than about 1010s-1, the observed onset of instabilities is\nindeed equal to the one predicted by the new instability criteria under small\ngradient disturbances. The observed onsets deviates from the predicted one at\nlager strain rates because of finite strain gradient effect. Interestingly, the\nstrain rate dependence of the TP also exhibits an obvious change at the same\nstrain rate, i.e., 1010 s-1. When 1010 s-1, a certain power law is obeyed, but\nit is not applicable at larger strain rates. This strain rate effect on the TP\nis well interpreted with nucleation time and the finite strain gradient effect.\nAccording to these basic understandings, the roles of strain rates on\nnucleation and growth of the phase transition are studied.\n", "  Learning from data has led to paradigm shifts in a multitude of disciplines,\nincluding web, text, and image search, speech recognition, as well as\nbioinformatics. Can machine learning enable similar breakthroughs in\nunderstanding quantum many-body systems? Here we develop an efficient deep\nlearning approach that enables spatially and chemically resolved insights into\nquantum-mechanical observables of molecular systems. We unify concepts from\nmany-body Hamiltonians with purpose-designed deep tensor neural networks\n(DTNN), which leads to size-extensive and uniformly accurate (1 kcal/mol)\npredictions in compositional and configurational chemical space for molecules\nof intermediate size. As an example of chemical relevance, the DTNN model\nreveals a classification of aromatic rings with respect to their stability -- a\nuseful property that is not contained as such in the training dataset. Further\napplications of DTNN for predicting atomic energies and local chemical\npotentials in molecules, reliable isomer energies, and molecules with peculiar\nelectronic structure demonstrate the high potential of machine learning for\nrevealing novel insights into complex quantum-chemical systems.\n", "  We test extensions to the standard cosmological model with weak gravitational\nlensing tomography using 450 deg$^2$ of imaging data from the Kilo Degree\nSurvey (KiDS). In these extended cosmologies, which include massive neutrinos,\nnonzero curvature, evolving dark energy, modified gravity, and running of the\nscalar spectral index, we also examine the discordance between KiDS and cosmic\nmicrowave background measurements from Planck. The discordance between the two\ndatasets is largely unaffected by a more conservative treatment of the lensing\nsystematics and the removal of angular scales most sensitive to nonlinear\nphysics. The only extended cosmology that simultaneously alleviates the\ndiscordance with Planck and is at least moderately favored by the data includes\nevolving dark energy with a time-dependent equation of state (in the form of\nthe $w_0-w_a$ parameterization). In this model, the respective $S_8 = \\sigma_8\n\\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3}$ constraints agree at the $1\\sigma$ level, and there\nis `substantial concordance' between the KiDS and Planck datasets when\naccounting for the full parameter space. Moreover, the Planck constraint on the\nHubble constant is wider than in LCDM and in agreement with the Riess et al.\n(2016) direct measurement of $H_0$. The dark energy model is moderately favored\nas compared to LCDM when combining the KiDS and Planck measurements, and\nremains moderately favored after including an informative prior on the Hubble\nconstant. In both of these scenarios, marginalized constraints in the $w_0-w_a$\nplane are discrepant with a cosmological constant at the $3\\sigma$ level.\nMoreover, KiDS constrains the sum of neutrino masses to 4.0 eV (95% CL), finds\nno preference for time or scale dependent modifications to the metric\npotentials, and is consistent with flatness and no running of the spectral\nindex. The analysis code is public at https://github.com/sjoudaki/kids450\n", "  Quantum walks are standard tools for searching graphs for marked vertices,\nand they often yield quadratic speedups over a classical random walk's hitting\ntime. In some exceptional cases, however, the system only evolves by sign\nflips, staying in a uniform probability distribution for all time. We prove\nthat the one-dimensional periodic lattice or cycle with any arrangement of\nmarked vertices is such an exceptional configuration. Using this discovery, we\nconstruct a search problem where the quantum walk's random sampling yields an\narbitrary speedup in query complexity over the classical random walk's hitting\ntime. In this context, however, the mixing time to prepare the initial uniform\nstate is a more suitable comparison than the hitting time, and then the speedup\nis roughly quadratic.\n", "  Matra Gravitational and Geophysical Laboratory (MGGL) has been established\nnear Gy\\\"ongy\\\"osoroszi, Hungary in 2015, in the cavern system of an unused ore\nmine. The Laboratory is located at 88~m below the surface, with the aim to\nmeasure and analyse the advantages of the underground installation of third\ngeneration gravitational wave detectors. Specialized instruments have been\ninstalled to measure seismic, infrasound, electromagnetic noise, and the\nvariation of the cosmic muon flux. In the preliminary (RUN-0) test period,\nMarch-August 2016, data collection has been accomplished. In this paper we\ndescribe the research potential of the MGGL, list the installed equipments and\nsummarize the experimental results of RUN-0. Here we report RUN-0 data, that\nprepares systematic and synchronized data collection of the next run period.\n", "  We present an approach to fabrication and packaging of integrated photonic\ndevices that utilizes waveguide and detector layers deposited at near-ambient\ntemperature. All lithography is performed with a 365 nm i-line stepper,\nfacilitating low cost and high scalability. We have shown low-loss SiN\nwaveguides, high-$Q$ ring resonators, critically coupled ring resonators, 50/50\nbeam splitters, Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) and a process-agnostic\nfiber packaging scheme. We have further explored the utility of this process\nfor applications in nonlinear optics and quantum photonics. We demonstrate\nspectral tailoring and octave-spanning supercontinuum generation as well as the\nintegration of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors with MZIs and\nchannel-dropping filters. The packaging approach is suitable for operation up\nto 160 \\degree C as well as below 1 K. The process is well suited for\naugmentation of existing foundry capabilities or as a stand-alone process.\n", "  A class of nonstationary spacetimes is obtained by means of a conformal\ntransformation of the Schwarzschild metric, where the conformal factor $a(t)$\nis an arbitrary function of the time coordinate only. We investigate several\nsituations including some where the final state is a central object with\nconstant mass. The metric is such that there is an initial big-bang type\nsingularity and the final state depends on the chosen conformal factor. The\nMisner-Sharp mass is computed and a localized central object may be identified.\nThe trapping horizons, geodesic and causal structure of the resulting\nspacetimes are investigated in detail. When $a(t)$ asymptotes to a constant in\na short enough time scale, the spacetime presents an event horizon and its\nanalytical extension reveals black-hole or white-hole regions. On the other\nhand, when $a(t)$ is unbounded from above as in cosmological models, the\nspacetime presents no event horizons and may present null singularities in the\nfuture. The energy-momentum content and other properties of the respective\nspacetimes are also investigated.\n", "  Via the application of parallel magnetic field, we induce a single-layer to\nbilayer transition in two-dimensional electron systems confined to wide GaAs\nquantum wells, and study the geometric resonance of composite fermions (CFs)\nwith a periodic density modulation in our samples. The measurements reveal that\nCFs exist close to bilayer quantum Hall states, formed at Landau level filling\nfactors $\\nu=1$ and 1/2. Near $\\nu=1$, the geometric resonance features are\nconsistent with half the total electron density in the bilayer system, implying\nthat CFs prefer to stay in separate layers and exhibit a two-component\nbehavior. In contrast, close to $\\nu=1/2$, CFs appear single-layer-like\n(single-component) as their resonance features correspond to the total density.\n", "  Dynamical strain generated upon excitation of a metallic film by a\nfemtosecond laser pulse may become a versatile tool enabling control of\nmagnetic state of thin films and nanostructures via inverse magnetostriction on\na picosecond time scale. Here we explore two alternative approaches to\nmanipulate magnetocrystalline anisotropy and excite magnetization precession in\na low-symmetry film of a magnetic metallic alloy galfenol (Fe,Ga) either by\ninjecting picosecond strain pulse into it from a substrate or by generating\ndynamical strain of complex temporal profile in the film directly. In the\nformer case we realize ultrafast excitation of magnetization dynamics solely by\nstrain pulses. In the latter case optically-generated strain emerged abruptly\nin the film modifies its magnetocrystalline anisotropy, competing with\nheat-induced change of anisotropy parameters. We demonstrate that the\noptically-generated strain remains efficient for launching magnetization\nprecession, when the heat-induced changes of anisotropy parameters do not\ntrigger the precession anymore. We emphasize that in both approaches the\nultrafast change of magnetic anisotropy mediating the precession excitation\nrelies on mixed, compressive and shear, character of the dynamical strain,\nwhich emerges due to low-symmetry of the metallic film under study.\n", "  Polymer nanocomposite dielectrics are promising materials for electrical\ninsulation in high voltage applications. However, the physics behind their\nperformance is not yet fully understood. We use density functional theory to\ninvestigate electronic properties of the interfacial area in magnesium\noxide-polyethylene nanocomposite. Our results demonstrate polyethylene\nconduction band matching with conduction bands of different surfaces of\nmagnesium oxide. Such band bending results in long range potential wells of up\nto 2.6 eV deep. Furthermore, the fundamental influence of silicon treatment on\nmagnesium oxide surface properties is assessed. We report a reduction of the\nsurface-induced states at the silicon-treated interface. The simulations\nprovide information used to propose a new model for charge trapping in\nnanocomposite dielectrics.\n", "  Multi-band touchings together with the emergence of fermions exhibiting\nlinear dispersions have recently been predicted and realized in various\nmaterials. We first investigate the Adler-Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly in these\nmulti-band touching semimetals when they are described by the pseudospin\noperator in high dimensional representation. By evaluating the Chern number, we\nshow that the anomalous Hall effect is enhanced depending on the magnitude of\nthe pseudospin. It is also confirmed by the analysis of the Landau levels when\nmagnetic field is applied. Namely, charge pumping occurs from one multi-band\ntouching point to another through multi-channel Landau levels in the presence\nof parallel electric and magnetic fields. We also show a pair annihilation of\ntwo multi-band touching points by photo-irradiation. Furthermore, we propose\ngeneralizations of Dirac semimetals, multiple-Weyl semimetals and loop-nodal\nsemimetals to those composed of fermions carrying pseudospins in high\ndimensional representation. Finally we investigate the 3-band touching\nprotected by the $% C_{3}$ symmetry. We show that the 3-band touching point is\nbroken into two Weyl points by photo-irradiation.\n", "  The possibility to detect cosmic strings -- topological defects of early\nUniverse, by means of wave effects in gravitational lensing is discussed. To\nfind the optimal observation conditions, we define the hyperbolic-shaped\nFresnel observation zones associated with the diffraction maxima and analyse\nthe frequency patterns of wave amplification corresponding to different\nalignments. In particular, we show that diffraction of gravitational waves by\nthe string may lead to significant amplification at cosmological distances. The\nwave properties we found are quite different from what one would expect, for\ninstance, from light scattered off a thin wire or slit, since a cosmic string,\nas a topological defect, gives no shadow at all.\n", "  After the discovery of extraterrestrial high-energy neutrinos, the next major\ngoal of neutrino telescopes will be identifying astrophysical objects that\nproduce them. The flux of the brightest source $F_{\\rm max}$, however, cannot\nbe probed by studying the diffuse neutrino intensity. We aim at constraining\n$F_{\\rm max}$ by adopting a broken power-law flux distribution, a hypothesis\nsupported by observed properties of any generic astrophysical sources. The\nfirst estimate of $F_{\\rm max}$ comes from the fact that we can only observe\none universe, and hence, the expected number of sources above $F_{\\rm max}$\ncannot be too small compared with one. For abundant source classes such as\nstarburst galaxies, this one-source constraint yields a value of $F_{\\rm max}$\nthat is an order of magnitude lower than the current upper limits from\npoint-source searches. Then we derive upper limits on $F_{\\rm max}$ assuming\nthat the angular power spectrum is consistent with neutrino shot noise yet. We\nfind that the limits obtained with upgoing muon neutrinos in IceCube can\nalready be quite competitive, especially for rare but bright source populations\nsuch as blazars. The limits will improve nearly quadratically with exposure,\nand therefore be even more powerful for the next generation of neutrino\ntelescopes.\n", "  A principal goal of gravitational-wave astronomy is to constrain the neutron\nstar equation of state (EOS) by measuring the tidal deformability of neutron\nstars. The tidally induced departure of the waveform from that of\npoint-particle (or spinless binary black hole (BBH)) increases with the\nstiffness of the EOS. We show that causality (the requirement that the speed of\nsound is less than the speed of light for a perfect fluid satisfying a\none-parameter equation of state) places an upper bound on tidal deformability\nas a function of mass. Like the upper mass limit, the limit on deformabity is\nobtained by using an EOS with $v_{sound} = c$ for high densities and matching\nto a low density (candidate) EOS at a matching density of order nuclear\nsaturation density. We use these results and those of [B.D. Lackey et al.,\nPhys. Rev. D 89, 043009 (2014)] to estimate the resulting upper limit on the\ngravitational-wave phase shift of a black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary\nrelative to a BBH. Even for assumptions weak enough to allow an maximum mass of\n$4\\ M_\\odot$ (a match at nuclear saturation density to an unusually stiff\nlow-density candidate EOS), the upper limit on dimensionless tidal\ndeformability is stringent. It leads to a still more stringent estimated upper\nlimit on the maximum tidally induced phase shift prior to merger. We comment in\nan appendix on the relation between causality, the condition $v_{sound} < c$,\nand the condition $dp/d\\epsilon < 1$ for the effective EOS governing the\nequilibrium star.\n", "  Shape memory alloys often show a complex hierarchical morphology in the\nmartensitic state. To understand the formation of this twin-within-twins\nmicrostructure, we examine epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films as a model system. In-situ\nscanning electron microscopy experiments show beautiful complex twinning\npatterns with a number of different mesoscopic twin boundaries and macroscopic\ntwin boundaries between already twinned regions. We explain the appearance and\ngeometry of these patterns by constructing an internally twinned martensitic\nnucleus, which can take the shape of a diamond or a parallelogram, within the\nbasic phenomenological theory of martensite. These nucleus contains already the\nseeds of different possible mesoscopic twin boundaries. Nucleation and growth\nof these nuclei determines the creation of the hierarchical space-filling\nmartensitic microstructure. This is in contrast to previous approaches to\nexplain a hierarchical martensitic microstructure. This new picture of creation\nand anisotropic, well-oriented growth of twinned martensitic nuclei explains\nthe morphology and exact geometrical features of our experimentally observed\ntwins-within-twins microstructure on the meso- and macroscopic scale.\n", "  Extreme nanowires (ENs) represent the ultimate class of crystals: They are\nthe smallest possible periodic materials. With atom-wide motifs repeated in one\ndimension (1D), they offer a privileged perspective into the Physics and\nChemistry of low-dimensional systems. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)\nprovide ideal environments for the creation of such materials. Here we present\na comprehensive study of Te ENs encapsulated inside ultra- narrow SWCNTs with\ndiameters between 0.7 nm and 1.1 nm. We combine state-of-the-art imaging\ntechniques and 1D-adapted ab initio structure prediction to treat both\nconfinement and periodicity effects. The studied Te ENs adopt a variety of\nstructures, exhibiting a true 1D realisation of a Peierls structural distortion\nand transition from metallic to insulating behaviour as a function of\nencapsulating diameter. We analyse the mechanical stability of the encapsulated\nENs and show that nanoconfinement is not only a useful means to produce ENs,\nbut may actually be necessary, in some cases, to prevent them from\ndisintegrating. The ability to control functional properties of these ENs with\nconfinement has numerous applications in future device technologies, and we\nanticipate that our study will set the basic paradigm to be adopted in the\ncharacterisation and understanding of such systems.\n", "  We study a series of perturbations on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We\nshow that the chaotic non-Fermi liquid phase described by the ordinary $q = 4$\nSYK model has marginally relevant/irrelevant (depending on the sign of the\ncoupling constants) four-fermion perturbations allowed by symmetry. Changing\nthe sign of one of these four-fermion perturbations leads to a continuous\nchaotic-nonchaotic quantum phase transition of the system accompanied by a\nspontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Starting with the SYK$_q$ model\nwith a $q-$fermion interaction, similar perturbations can lead to a series of\nnew interacting conformal field theory fixed points.\n", "  With infrared (IR) ellipsometry and DC resistance measurements we\ninvestigated the photo-doping at the (001) and (110) surfaces of SrTiO$_3$\n(STO) single crystals and at the corresponding interfaces of\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO) heterostructures. In the bare STO crystals we\nfind that the photo-generated charge carriers, which accumulate near the (001)\nsurface, have a similar depth profile and sheet carrier concentration as the\nconfined electrons that were previously observed in LAO/STO (001)\nheterostructures. A large fraction of these photo-generated charge carriers\npersist at low temperature at the STO (001) surface even after the UV light has\nbeen switched off again. These persistent charge carriers seem to originate\nfrom oxygen vacancies that are trapped at the structural domain boundaries\nwhich develop below the so-called antiferrodistortive transition at T* = 105 K.\nThis is most evident from a corresponding photo-doping study of the DC\ntransport in STO (110) crystals for which the concentration of these domain\nboundaries can be modified by applying a weak uniaxial stress. The oxygen\nvacancies and their trapping by defects are also the source of the electrons\nthat are confined to the interface of LAO/STO (110) heterostructures which\nlikely do not have a polar discontinuity as in LAO/STO (001). In the former,\nthe trapping and clustering of the oxygen vacancies also has a strong influence\non the anisotropy of the charge carrier mobility. We show that this anisotropy\ncan be readily varied and even inverted by various means, such as a gentle\nthermal treatment, UV irradiation, or even a weak uniaxial stress. Our\nexperiments suggest that extended defects, which develop over long time periods\n(of weeks to months), can strongly influence the response of the confined\ncharge carriers at the LAO/STO (110) interface.\n", "  A model for ionic and electronic grain boundary transport through thin films,\nscales or membranes with columnar grain structure is introduced. The grain\nstructure is idealized as a lattice of identical hexagonal cells - a honeycomb\npattern. Reactions with the environment constitute the boundary conditions and\ndrive the transport between the surfaces. Time-dependent simulations solving\nthe Poisson equation self-consistently with the Nernst-Planck flux equations\nfor the mobile species are performed. In the resulting Poisson-Nernst-Planck\nsystem of equations, the electrostatic potential is obtained from the Poisson\nequation in its integral form by summation. The model is used to interpret\nalumina membrane oxygen permeation experiments, in which different oxygen gas\npressures are applied at opposite membrane surfaces and the resulting flux of\noxygen molecules through the membrane is measured. Simulation results involving\nfour mobile species, charged aluminum and oxygen vacancies, electrons, and\nholes, provide a complete description of the measurements and insight into the\nmicroscopic processes underpinning the oxygen permeation of the membrane. Most\nnotably, the hypothesized transition between p-type and n-type ionic\nconductivity of the alumina grain boundaries as a function of the applied\noxygen gas pressure is observed in the simulations. The range of validity of a\nsimple analytic model for the oxygen permeation rate, similar to the Wagner\ntheory of metal oxidation, is quantified by comparison to the numeric\nsimulations. The three-dimensional model we develop here is readily adaptable\nto problems such as transport in a solid state electrode, or corrosion scale\ngrowth.\n", "  We obtain the black brane solution in arbitrary dimensional\nGauss-Bonnet-axions (GBA) gravity theory. And then the thermal conductivity of\nthe boundary theory dual to this neutral black brane is explored. We find that\nthe momentum dissipation suppresses the DC thermal conductivity while it is\nenhanced by larger GB parameter. The analytical and numerical results of DC\nthermal conductivity match very well. Also we study the effect of the momentum\ndissipation and the GB coupling on the AC thermal conductivity and fit the\nresults by Drude-like behavior for low frequency. Finally, we analytical\ncompute the quasi-normal modes (QNM) frequency of the perturbative master field\nin large dimensions limit. Our analytical QNM frequencies agree well with the\nnumerical results in large enough finite dimensions.\n", "  We present the constraints on the trilinear Higgs self coupling that arise\nfrom loop effects in the $W$ boson mass and the effective sine predictions. We\ncompute the contributions to these precision observables of two-loop diagrams\nfeaturing an anomalous trilinear Higgs self coupling. We explicitly show that\nthe same anomalous contributions are found if the analysis of $m_{\n\\scriptscriptstyle W}$ and $\\mbox{$\\sin^2 \\theta^{{\\rm lep}}_{{\\rm eff}}$}$ is\nperformed in a theory in which the scalar potential in the Standard Model\nLagrangian is modified by an (in)finite tower of $(\\Phi^\\dagger \\Phi)^n$ terms\nwith $\\Phi$ the Higgs doublet. We find that the bounds on the trilinear Higgs\nself coupling from precision observables are competitive with those coming from\nHiggs pair production.\n", "  We investigate the onset of superconductivity in magnetic field for a clean\ntwo-dimensional multiple-band superconductor in the vicinity of the Lifshitz\ntransition when one of the bands is very shallow. Due to small number of\ncarriers in this band, the quasiclassical Werthamer-Helfand approximation\nbreaks down and Landau quantization has to be taken into account. We found that\nthe transition temperature TC2(H) has giant oscillations and is resonantly\nenhanced at the magnetic fields corresponding to full occupancy of the Landau\nlevels in the shallow band. This enhancement is especially pronounced for the\nlowest Landau level. As a consequence, the reentrant superconducting regions in\nthe temperature-field phase diagram emerge at low temperatures near the\nmagnetic fields at which the chemical potential matches the Landau levels. The\nspecific behavior depends on the relative strength of the intraband and\ninterband pairing interactions and the reentrance is most pronounced in the\npurely interband coupling scenario. The reentrant behavior is suppressed by the\nZeeman spin splitting in the shallow band, the separated regions disappear\nalready for very small spin-splitting factors. On the other hand, the\nreentrance is restored in the resonance cases when the spin-splitting energy\nexactly matches the separation between the Landau levels. The predicted\nbehavior may realize in the gate-tuned FeSe monolayer.\n", "  In a bilayer system consisting of a composite-fermion Fermi sea in each\nlayer, the tunnel current is exponentially suppressed at zero bias, followed by\na strong peak at a finite bias voltage $V_{\\rm max}$. This behavior, which is\nqualitatively different from that observed for the electron Fermi sea, provides\nfundamental insight into the strongly correlated non-Fermi liquid nature of the\nCF Fermi sea and, in particular, offers a window into the short-distance\nhigh-energy physics of this state. We identify the exciton responsible for the\npeak current and provide a quantitative account of the value of $V_{\\rm max}$.\nThe excitonic attraction is shown to be quantitatively significant, and its\nvariation accounts for the increase of $V_{\\rm max}$ with the application of an\nin-plane magnetic field. We also estimate the critical Zeeman energy where\ntransition occurs from a fully spin polarized composite fermion Fermi sea to a\npartially spin polarized one, carefully incorporating corrections due to finite\nwidth and Landau level mixing, and find it to be in satisfactory agreement with\nthe Zeeman energy where a qualitative change has been observed for the onset\nbias voltage [Eisenstein et al., Phys. Rev. B 94, 125409 (2016)]. For\nfractional quantum Hall states, we predict a substantial discontinuous jump in\n$V_{\\rm max}$ when the system undergoes a transition from a fully spin\npolarized state to a spin singlet or a partially spin polarized state.\n", "  We found new two-dimensional (2D) quantum (S=1/2) antiferromagnetic systems:\nCuRE2Ge2O8 (RE=Y and La). According to our analysis of high-resolution X-ray\nand neutron diffraction experiments, the Cu-network of CuRE2Ge2O8 (RE=Y and La)\nexhibits a 2D triangular lattice linked via weak bonds along the perpendicular\nb-axis. Our bulk characterizations from 0.08 to 400 K show that they undergo a\nlong-range order at 0.51(1) and 1.09(4) K for the Y and La systems,\nrespectively. Interestingly, they also exhibit field induced phase transitions.\nFor theoretical understanding, we carried out the density functional theory\n(DFT) band calculations to find that they are typical charge-transfer-type\ninsulators with a gap of Eg = 2 eV. Taken together, our observations make\nCuRE2Ge2O8 (RE=Y and La) additional examples of low-dimensional quantum spin\ntriangular antiferromagnets with the low-temperature magnetic ordering.\n", "  We present a new wavefunction ansatz that combines the strengths of spin\nprojection with the language of matrix product states (MPS) and matrix product\noperators (MPO) as used in the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG).\nSpecifically, spin-projected matrix product states (SP-MPS) are constructed as\n$|\\Psi^{(N,S,M)}_{SP-MPS}\\rangle=\\mathcal{P}_S|\\Psi_{MPS}^{(N,M)}\\rangle$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}_S$ is the spin projector for total spin $S$ and\n$|\\Psi_{MPS}^{(N,M)}\\rangle$ is an MPS wavefunction with a given particle\nnumber $N$ and spin projection $M$. This new ansatz possesses several\nattractive features: (1) It provides a much simpler route to achieve\nspin-adaptation (i.e. to create eigenfunctions of $\\hat{S}^2$) compared to\nexplicitly incorporating the non-Abelian SU(2) symmetry into the MPS. In\nparticular, since the underlying state in the SP-MPS uses only Abelian\nsymmetries, one does not need the singlet embedding scheme for non-singlet\nstates, as normally employed in spin-adapted DMRG, to achieve a single\nconsistent variationally optimized state. (2) Due to the use of\n$|\\Psi_{MPS}^{(N,M)}\\rangle$ as its underlying state, the SP-MPS can be closely\nconnected to broken symmetry mean-field states. This allows to\nstraightforwardly generate the large number of broken symmetry guesses needed\nto explore complex electronic landscapes in magnetic systems. Further, this\nconnection can be exploited in the future development of quantum embedding\ntheories for open-shell systems. (3) The sum of MPOs representation for the\nHamiltonian and spin projector $\\mathcal{P}_S$ naturally leads to an\nembarrassingly parallel algorithm for computing expectation values and\noptimizing SP-MPS. (4) Optimizing SP-MPS belongs to the\nvariation-after-projection (VAP) class of spin projected theories.\n", "  The complex field $\\Phi$ containing the QCD axion has a natural portal\ncoupling to the Higgs doublet of the form $\\lambda_{h \\phi}|\\Phi|^2 |H|^2$.\nHere we consider the possibility that $\\lambda_{h \\phi}$ has a natural\nmagnitude for a dimensionless coupling, $\\lambda_{h \\phi} \\sim 0.1-1$. This is\npossible if the total mass squared parameter of the Higgs in the vacuum,\nincluding quadratic divergent and the $\\Phi$ vacuum expectation value\ncontributions, is renormalized to reproduce the observed Higgs boson mass. It\nis then possible for the axion sector to stabilize the electroweak vacuum. We\nshow the requirement of electroweak vacuum stability implies that the axion\ndecay constant satisfies $f_{a} < 1.3 \\times 10^{10}$ GeV.\n", "  Transient currents in atomically thin MoTe$_2$ field-effect transistor are\nmeasured during cycles of pulses through the gate electrode. The transients are\nanalyzed in light of a newly proposed model for charge trapping dynamics that\nrenders a time-dependent change in threshold voltage the dominant effect on the\nchannel hysteretic behavior over emission currents from the charge traps. The\nproposed model is expected to be instrumental in understanding the fundamental\nphysics that governs the performance of atomically thin FETs and is applicable\nto the entire class of atomically thin-based devices. Hence, the model is vital\nto the intelligent design of fast and highly efficient opto-electronic devices.\n", "  We study the projective properties of planar zeros of tree-level scattering\namplitudes in various theories. Whereas for pure scalar field theories we find\nthat the planar zeros of the five-point amplitude do not enjoy projective\ninvariance, coupling scalars to gauge fields gives rise to tree-level\namplitudes whose planar zeros are determined by homogeneous polynomials in the\nstereographic coordinates labelling the direction of flight of the outgoing\nparticles. In the case of pure gauge theories, this projective structure is\ngenerically destroyed if string corrections are taken into account. Scattering\namplitudes of two scalars with graviton emission vanish exactly in the planar\nlimit, whereas planar graviton amplitudes are zero for helicity violating\nconfigurations. These results are corrected by string effects, computed using\nthe single-valued projection, which render the planar amplitude nonzero.\nFinally, we discuss how the structure of planar zeros can be derived from the\nsoft limit behavior of the scattering amplitudes.\n", "  The discovery of $\\gamma$-ray emission from radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1\n(NLSy1) galaxies has questioned the need for large black hole masses (> 10$^8$\nM$_{\\odot}$) to launch relativistic jets. We present near-infrared data of the\n$\\gamma$-ray-emitting NLSy1 FBQS J1644+2619 that were collected using the\ncamera CIRCE (Canarias InfraRed Camera Experiment) at the 10.4-m Gran\nTelescopio Canarias to investigate the structural properties of its host galaxy\nand to infer the black hole mass. The 2D surface brightness profile is modelled\nby the combination of a nuclear and a bulge component with a S\\'ersic profile\nwith index $n$ = 3.7, indicative of an elliptical galaxy. The structural\nparameters of the host are consistent with the correlations of effective radius\nand surface brightness against absolute magnitude measured for elliptical\ngalaxies. From the bulge luminosity, we estimated a black hole mass of\n(2.1$\\pm$0.2) $\\times$10$^8$ M$_{\\odot}$, consistent with the values\ncharacterizing radio-loud active galactic nuclei.\n", "  An implementation of a novel of glass-based detector with fast response and\nwide detection range is needed to increase resolution for ultra-high energy\ncosmic rays detection. Such detector has been designed and built for the\nHorizon-T detector system at Tien Shan high-altitude Science Station. The main\ncharacteristics, such as design, duration of the detector pulse and calibration\nof a single particle response are discussed.\n", "  A dynamical estimate is given for the Boltzmann entropy of the Universe,\nunder the simplifying assumptions provided by Newtonian cosmology. We first\nmodel the cosmological fluid as the probability fluid of a quantum-mechanical\nsystem. Next, following current ideas about the emergence of spacetime, we\nregard gravitational equipotentials as isoentropic surfaces. Therefore\ngravitational entropy is proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the\ngravitational potential in a certain quantum state describing the matter\ncontents of the Universe. The entropy of the matter sector can also be\ncomputed. While providing values of the entropy that turn out to be somewhat\nhigher than existing estimates, our results are in perfect compliance with the\nupper bound set by the holographic principle.\n", "  We study electrical transport properties in exfoliated molybdenum disulfide\n(MoS2) back-gated field effect transistors at low drain bias and under\ndifferent illumination intensities. It is found that photoconductive and\nphotogating effect as well as space charge limited conduction can\nsimultaneously occur. We point out that the photoconductivity increases\nlogarithmically with the light intensity and can persist with a decay time\nlonger than 10^4 s, due to photo-charge trapping at the MoS2/SiO2 interface and\nin MoS2 defects. The transfer characteristics present hysteresis that is\nenhanced by illumination. At low drain bias, the devices feature low contact\nresistance of 1.4 k{\\Omega}/{\\mu}m, ON current as high as 1.25 nA/{\\mu}m, 10^5\nON-OFF ratio, mobility of 1 cm^2/Vs and photoresponsivity R=1 A/W.\n", "  In this paper, we have explored the effects of dissipation on the dynamics of\ncharged bulk viscous collapsing cylindrical source which allows the out follow\nof heat flux in the form of radiations. Misner-Sharp formulism has been\nimplemented to drive the dynamical equation in term of proper time and radial\nderivatives. We have investigated the effects of charge and bulk viscosity on\nthe dynamics of collapsing cylinder. To determine the effects of radial heat\nflux, we have formulated the heat transport equations in the context of\nM$\\ddot{u}$ller-Israel-Stewart theory by assuming that thermodynamics\nviscous/heat coupling coefficients can be neglected within some approximations.\nIn our discussion, we have introduced the viscosity by the standard\n(non-casual) thermodynamics approach. The dynamical equations have been coupled\nwith the heat transport equation equation, the consequences of resulting\ncoupled heat equation have been analyzed in detail.\n", "  Neural networks are being used to make new types of empirical chemical models\nas inexpensive as force fields, but with accuracy close to the ab-initio\nmethods used to build them. Besides modeling potential energy surfaces,\nneural-nets can provide qualitative insights and make qualitative chemical\ntrends quantitatively predictable. In this work we present a neural-network\nthat predicts the energies of molecules as a sum of bond energies. The network\nlearns the total energies of the popular GDB9 dataset to a competitive MAE of\n0.94 kcal/mol. The method is naturally linearly scaling, and applicable to\nmolecules of nanoscopic size. More importantly it gives chemical insight into\nthe relative strengths of bonds as a function of their molecular environment,\ndespite only being trained on total energy information. We show that the\nnetwork makes predictions of relative bond strengths in good agreement with\nmeasured trends and human predictions. We show that DIM-NN learns the same\nheuristic trends in relative bond strength developed by expert synthetic\nchemists, and ab-initio bond order measures such as NBO analysis.\n", "  Einstein's weak equivalence principle (WEP) states that any freely falling,\nuncharged test particle follows the same identical trajectory independent of\nits internal structure and composition. Since the polarization of a photon is\nconsidered to be part of its internal structure, we propose that polarized\nphotons from astrophysical transients, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and fast\nradio bursts (FRBs), can be used to constrain the accuracy of the WEP through\nthe Shapiro time delay effect. Assuming that the arrival time delays of photons\nwith different polarizations are mainly attributed to the gravitational\npotential of the Laniakea supercluster of galaxies, we show that a strict upper\nlimit on the differences of the parametrized post-Newtonian parameter $\\gamma$\nvalue for the polarized optical emission of GRB 120308A is\n$\\Delta\\gamma<1.2\\times10^{-10}$, for the polarized gamma-ray emission of GRB\n100826A is $\\Delta\\gamma<1.2\\times10^{-10}$, and for the polarized radio\nemission of FRB 150807 is $\\Delta\\gamma<2.2\\times10^{-16}$. These are the first\ndirect verifications of the WEP for multiband photons with different\npolarizations. In particular, the result from FRB 150807 provides the most\nstringent limit to date on a deviation from the WEP, improving by one order of\nmagnitude the previous best result based on Crab pulsar photons with different\nenergies.\n", "  Hysteretic effects are investigated in perovskite solar cells in the standard\nFTO/TiO$_2$/CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_{3-x}$Cl$_x$/spiro-OMeTAD/Au configuration. We\nreport normal (NH) and inverted hysteresis (IH) in the J-V characteristics\noccurring for the same device structure, the behavior strictly depending on the\npre-poling bias. NH typically appears at pre-poling biases larger than the open\ncircuit bias, while pronounced IH occurs for negative bias pre-poling. The\ntransition from NH to IH is marked by a intermediate mixed hysteresis behavior\ncharacterized by a crossing point in the J-V characteristics. The measured J-V\ncharacteristics are explained quantitatively by the dynamic electrical model\n(DEM). Furthermore, the influence of the bias scan rate on the NH/IH hysteresis\nis discussed based on the time evolution of the non-linear polarization.\nIntroducing a three step measurement protocol, which includes stabilization,\npre-poling and measurement, we put forward the difficulties and possible\nsolutions for a correct PCE evaluation.\n", "  We use information entropy to analyze the anisotropy in the mock galaxy\ncatalogues from dark matter distribution and simulated biased galaxy\ndistributions from $\\Lambda$CDM N-body simulation. We show that one can recover\nthe linear bias parameter of the simulated galaxy distributions by comparing\nthe radial, polar and azimuthal anisotropies in the simulated galaxy\ndistributions with that from the dark matter distribution. This method for\ndetermination of the linear bias requires only $O(N)$ operations as compared to\n$O(N^{2})$ or at least $O(N \\log N)$ operations required for the methods based\non the two-point correlation function and the power spectrum. We apply this\nmethod to determine the linear bias parameter for the galaxies in the 2MASS\nRedshift Survey (2MRS) and find that the 2MRS galaxies in the $K_{s}$ band have\na linear bias of $\\sim 1.3$.\n", "  We review and test twelve different approaches to the detection of\nfinite-time coherent material structures in two-dimensional, temporally\naperiodic flows. We consider both mathematical methods and diagnostic scalar\nfields, comparing their performance on three benchmark examples: the\nquasiperiodically forced Bickley jet, a two-dimensional turbulence simulation,\nand an observational wind velocity field from Jupiter's atmosphere. A close\ninspection of the results reveals that the various methods often produce very\ndifferent predictions for coherent structures, once they are evaluated beyond\nheuristic visual assessment. As we find by passive advection of the coherent\nset candidates, false positives and negatives can be produced even by some of\nthe mathematically justified methods due to the ineffectiveness of their\nunderlying coherence principles in certain flow configurations. We summarize\nthe inferred strengths and weaknesses of each method, and make general\nrecommendations for minimal self-consistency requirements that any Lagrangian\ncoherence detection technique should satisfy.\n", "  We have studied the topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$(111) by means of\nhelium atom scattering. The average electron-phonon coupling $\\lambda$ of\nBi$_2$Te$_3$(111) is determined by adapting a recently developed\nquantum-theoretical derivation of the helium scattering probabilities to the\ncase of degenerate semiconductors. Based on the Debye-Waller attenuation of the\nelastic diffraction peaks of Bi$_2$Te$_3$(111), measured at surface\ntemperatures between $110~\\mbox{K}$ and $355~\\mbox{K}$, we find $\\lambda$ to be\nin the range of $0.04-0.11$. This method allows to extract a correctly averaged\n$\\lambda$ and to address the discrepancy between previous studies. The\nrelatively modest value of $\\lambda$ is not surprising even though some\nindividual phonons may provide a larger electron-phonon interaction.\n  Furthermore, the surface Debye temperature of Bi$_2$Te$_3$(111) is determined\nas ${\\rm \\Theta}_D = (81\\pm6)~\\mbox{K}$. The electronic surface corrugation was\nanalysed based on close-coupling calculations. By using a corrugated Morse\npotential a peak-to-peak corrugation of 9% of the lattice constant is obtained.\n", "  Topological phases of matter are considered the bedrock of novel quantum\nmaterials as well as ideal candidates for quantum computers that possess\nrobustness at the physical level. The robustness of the topological phase at\nfinite temperature or away from equilibrium is therefore a very desirable\nfeature. Disorder can improve the lifetime of the encoded topological qubits.\nHere we tackle the problem of the survival of the topological phase as detected\nby topological entropy, after a sudden quantum quench. We introduce a method to\nstudy analytically the time evolution of the system after a quantum quench and\nshow that disorder in the couplings of the Hamiltonian of the toric code and\nthe resulting Anderson localization can make the topological entropy resilient.\n", "  In this article we associate a combinatorial differential graded algebra to a\ncubic planar graph G. This algebra is defined combinatorially by counting\nbinary sequences, which we introduce, and several explicit computations are\nprovided. In addition, in the appendix by K. Sackel the F(q)-rational points of\nits graded augmentation variety are shown to coincide with (q+1)-colorings of\nthe dual graph.\n", "  For booster synchrotrons, like the SIS at GSI, space charge is one of the\nmain intensity limitations. At injection energy the space charge induced tune\nspreads in booster synchrotrons are large, reaching up to 0.5 and the ramping\ntimes are typically short. We study the effect of several localized electron\nlenses distributed equally around the circumference in order to compensate for\nthe transverse space charge force.\n", "  Topological materials in crystal solids, including topological insulators\n(TIs), topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), topological Dirac semimetals\n(DSMs), topological Weyl semimetals (WSMs), topological Dirac or Weyl nodal\nline semimetals (NLSMs) and beyond, are mainly featured with topological,\nprotected non-trivial surface states, and their bulk phases are insulators or\nsemimetals with the proper presence of Dirac cones, Weyl nodes or Dirac nodal\nlines around the Fermi level. The author suggests a two-step computational\nscreening strategy of 3D topological materials by mixing chemistry with physics\nwith the considerations of fully filled bands and band inversion.\n", "  It is generally accepted that, when moving in groups, animals process\ninformation to coordinate their motion. Recent studies have begun to apply\nrigorous methods based on Information Theory to quantify such distributed\ncomputation. Following this perspective, we use transfer entropy to quantify\ndynamic information flows locally in space and time across a school of fish\nduring directional changes around a circular tank, i.e. U-turns. This analysis\nreveals peaks in information flows during collective U-turns and identifies two\ndifferent flows: an informative flow (positive transfer entropy) based on fish\nthat have already turned about fish that are turning, and a misinformative flow\n(negative transfer entropy) based on fish that have not turned yet about fish\nthat are turning. We also reveal that the information flows are related to\nrelative position and alignment between fish, and identify spatial patterns of\ninformation and misinformation cascades. This study offers several\nmethodological contributions and we expect further application of these\nmethodologies to reveal intricacies of self-organisation in other animal groups\nand active matter in general.\n", "  We present a study on the evolution of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson bacterial\nphotosynthetic pigment-protein complex. This protein complex functions as an\nantenna. It transports absorbed photons - excitons - to a reaction center where\nphotosynthetic reactions initiate. The efficiency of exciton transport is\ntherefore fundamental for the photosynthetic bacterium's survival. We have\nreconstructed an ancestor of the complex to establish whether coherence in the\nexciton transport was selected for or optimized over time. We have also\ninvestigated on the role of optimizing free energy variation upon folding in\nevolution. We studied whether mutations which connect the ancestor to current\nday species were stabilizing or destabilizing from a thermodynamic view point.\nFrom this study, we established that most of these mutations were\nthermodynamically neutral. Furthermore, we did not see a large change in\nexciton transport efficiency or coherence and thus our results predict that\nexciton coherence was not specifically selected for.\n", "  This paper presents a topology optimization framework for structural problems\nsubjected to transient loading. The mechanical model assumes a linear elastic\nisotropic material, infinitesimal strains, and a dynamic response. The\noptimization problem is solved using the gradient-based optimizer Method of\nMoving Asymptotes (MMA) with time-dependent sensitivities provided via the\nadjoint method. The stiffness of materials is interpolated using the Solid\nIsotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method and the Heaviside Projection\nMethod (HPM) is used to stabilize the problem numerically and improve the\nmanufacturability of the topology-optimized designs. Both static and dynamic\noptimization examples are considered here. The resulting optimized designs\ndemonstrate the ability of topology optimization to tailor the transient\nresponse of structures.\n", "  In this paper, a random clique network model to mimic the large clustering\ncoefficient and the modular structure that exist in many real complex networks,\nsuch as social networks, artificial networks, and protein interaction networks,\nis introduced by combining the random selection rule of the Erd\\\"os and R\\'enyi\n(ER) model and the concept of cliques. We find that random clique networks\nhaving a small average degree differ from the ER network in that they have a\nlarge clustering coefficient and a power law clustering spectrum, while\nnetworks having a high average degree have similar properties as the ER model.\nIn addition, we find that the relation between the clustering coefficient and\nthe average degree shows a non-monotonic behavior and that the degree\ndistributions can be fit by multiple Poisson curves; we explain the origin of\nsuch novel behaviors and degree distributions.\n", "  In search of origin and mechanism of the high-dose high-temperature TL\nemission with presence of the peak `B` about thirty batches of LiF:Mg,Cu,P\ndetectors with different dopants` concentration were produced and comprehensive\nstudies of their high-dose TL features have been performed. Within each step of\nthe research, these characteristics were compared with the high-dose TL\nproperties of the typical MCP-N detectors` batch highly exposed simultaneously\nwith the detectors from batches of varying dopants concentration. We determined\nthe effect of concentration of specific dopants on the TL peak `B`. It was\nfound that both magnesium and copper are necessary to obtain high-dose TL\nsignal, however, the important for high-dose TL features seems to be also\nconcentration of phosphorus. In the framework of this study we present results\nof magnesium and copper concentration changes to the TL signal after high-doses\nof electron radiation.\n", "  The scattering state solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation with equal scalar\nand vector Varshni, Hellmann and Varshni-Shukla potentials for any arbitrary\nangular momentum quantum number l are investigated within the framework of the\nfunctional analytical method using a suitable approximation. The asymptotic\nwave functions, approximate scattering phase shifts, normalization constants\nand bound state energy equations were obtained. The non-relativistic limits of\nthe scattering phase shifts and the bound states energy equations for the three\npotentials were also obtained. Our bound states energy equations are in\nexcellent agreement with the available ones in the literature. Our numerical\nand graphical results indicate the dependence of phase shifts on the screening\nparameter \\b{eta}, the potential parameter b and angular momentum quantum\nnumber l.\n", "  We propose a method for demonstrating sub community structure in scientific\nnetworks of relatively small size from analyzing databases of publications.\nResearch relationships between the network members can be visualized as a graph\nwith vertices corresponding to authors and with edges indicating joint\nauthorship. Using a fast clustering algorithm combined with a graph layout\nalgorithm, we demonstrate how to display these clustering results in an\nattractive and informative way. The small size of the graph allows us to\ndevelop tools that keep track of how these research sub communities evolve in\ntime, as well as to present the research articles that create the links between\nthe network members. These tools are included in a web app, where the visitor\ncan easily identify the various sub communities, providing also valuable\ninformation for administrational purposes. Our method was developed for the\nGEAR mathematical network and it can be applied to other networks.\n", "  Several anomalies observed in short-baseline neutrino experiments indicate\nthat the standard 3-flavor framework may be incomplete and point towards the\nexistence of light sterile neutrinos. Here, we present a concise review of the\nstatus of the neutrino oscillations within the 3+1 scheme, which is a minimal\nextension of the standard 3-flavor framework with one sterile neutrino species.\nWe emphasize the potential role of LBL experiments in the searches of CP\nviolation connected to sterile neutrinos and their complementarity with the SBL\nexperiments.\n", "  The natural uranium assembly, \"QUINTA\", was irradiated with 2, 4, and 8 GeV\ndeuterons. The $^{232}$Th, $^{127}$I, and $^{129}$I samples have been exposed\nto secondary neutrons produced in the assembly at a 20-cm radial distance from\nthe deuteron beam axis. The spectra of gamma rays emitted by the activated\n$^{232}$Th, $^{127}$I, and $^{129}$I samples have been analyzed and several\ntens of product nuclei have been identified. For each of those products,\nneutron-induced reaction rates have been determined. The transmutation power\nfor the $^{129}$I samples is estimated. Experimental results were compared to\nthose calculated with well-known stochastic and deterministic codes.\n", "  The purpose of this note is to give a simple proof of the fact that a certain\nsubstack, defined in [2], of the moduli stack $T^{\\ast}Bun_G(\\Sigma)$ of Higgs\nbundles over a curve $\\Sigma$, for a connected, simply connected semisimple\ngroup $G$, possesses a Lagrangian structure. The substack, roughly speaking,\nconsists of images under the moment map of global sections of principal\n$G$-bundles over $\\Sigma$ twisted by a smooth symplectic variety with a\nHamiltonian $G$-action.\n", "  We consider the problem of testing two quantum hypotheses of quantum\noperations in the setting of many uses where an arbitrary prior distribution is\ngiven. The concept of the Chernoff bound for quantum operations is investigated\nto track the minimal average probability of error of discriminating two quantum\noperations asymptotically. We show that the Chernoff bound is faithful in the\nsense that it is finite if and only if the two quantum operations can not be\ndistinguished perfectly. More precisely, upper bounds of the Chernoff bound for\nquantum operations are provided. We then generalize these results to multiple\nChernoff bound for quantum operations.\n", "  We propose a way of computing 4-manifold invariants, old and new, as chiral\ncorrelation functions in half-twisted 2d $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ theories that\narise from compactification of fivebranes. Such formulation gives a new\ninterpretation of some known statements about Seiberg-Witten invariants, such\nas the basic class condition, and gives a prediction for structural properties\nof the multi-monopole invariants and their non-abelian generalizations.\n", "  We consider chiral fluids, with (nearly) massless fermionic constituents, in\nthe confining phase. Chiral vortical effect (CVE) is the flow of axial current\nalong the axis of rotation of the fluid while the spin alignment is a\nnon-vanishing correlation of polarizations of baryons with the axis of\nrotation. As the theoretical framework we use the model of pionic superfluidity\ninduced by a non-vanishing isotopic chemical potential. We note that the\naverage value of spin of virtual baryons reproduces the CVE. The role of\ndefects, or vortices is crucial. The model does not apply directly to the\nquark-gluon plasma but might indicate existence of a mechanism to produce\nbaryons with relatively large polarization in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  In the polluted bootstrap percolation model, the vertices of a graph are\nindependently declared initially occupied with probability p or closed with\nprobability q. At subsequent steps, a vertex becomes occupied if it is not\nclosed and it has at least r occupied neighbors. On the cubic lattice Z^d of\ndimension d>=3 with threshold r=2, we prove that the final density of occupied\nsites converges to 1 as p and q both approach 0, regardless of their relative\nscaling. Our result partially resolves a conjecture of Morris, and contrasts\nwith the d=2 case, where Gravner and McDonald proved that the critical\nparameter is q/{p^2}.\n", "  We study the effects of specimen mistilt on the picometer-scale measurement\nof local structure by combing experiment and simulation in annular bright-field\nscanning transmission electron microscopy (ABF-STEM). A relative distance\nmeasurement method is proposed to separate the tilt effects from the scan noise\nand scan distortion. We find that under a typical experimental condition a\nsmall specimen tilt (~6 mrad) in 25 nm thick SrTiO3 along [001] causes 11.9 pm\nartificial displacement between O and Sr/TiO columns in ABF image, which is\nmore than 3 times of scan noise and sample drift induced image distortion ~3.2\npm, suggesting the tilt effect could be dominant for the quantitative analysis\nof ABF images. The artifact depends the crystal mistilt angle, specimen\nthickness, defocus, convergence angle and uncorrected aberration. Our study\nprovides useful insights into detecting and correcting tilt effects during both\nexperiment operation and data analysis to extract the real structure\ninformation and avoid mis-interpretations of atomic structure as well as the\nproperties such as oxygen octahedral distortion/shift.\n", "  With the assistance of weak cross-Kerr nonlinearities, we introduce an\noptical scheme to fuse two small-size polarization entangled W states into a\nlarge-scale W state without qubit loss, i.e.,$\\mathrm{W}_{n+m}$ state can be\ngenerated from an $n$-qubit W state and a $m$-qubit W state. To complete the\nfusion task, two polarization entanglement processes and one spatial\nentanglement process are applied. The fulfillments of the above processes are\ncontributed by a cross-Kerr nonlinear interaction between the signal photons\nand a coherent state via Kerr media. We analyze the resource cost and the\nsuccess probability of the scheme. There is no complete failure output in our\nfusion mechanism, and all the garbage states are recyclable. In addition, there\nis no need for any controlled quantum gate and any ancillary photon, so it is\nsimple and feasible under the current experiment technology.\n", "  We present a fault-tolerant universal gate set consisting of Hadamard and\ncontrolled-controlled-Z (CCZ) on Bacon-Shor subsystem codes. Transversal\nnon-Clifford gates on these codes are intriguing in that higher levels of the\nClifford hierarchy become accessible as the code becomes more asymmetric. For\ninstance, in an appropriate gauge, Bacon-Shor codes on an $m\\times m^k$ lattice\nhave transversal $k$-qubit-controlled $Z$. Through a variety of tricks,\nincluding intermediate error-correction and non-Pauli recovery, we reduce the\noverhead required for fault-tolerant CCZ. We calculate pseudothresholds for our\nuniversal gate set on the smallest $3\\times3$ Bacon-Shor code and also compare\nour gates with magic-states within the framework of a proposed ion trap\narchitecture.\n", "  The force network ensemble is one of the most promising statistical\ndescriptions of granular media, with an entropy accounting for all force\nconfigurations at mechanical equilibrium consistent with some external stress.\nIt is possible to define a temperature-like parameter, the angoricity\n{\\alpha}^{-1}, which under isotropic compression is a scalar variable. This\nensemble is frequently studied on whole packings of grains; however, previous\nworks have shown that spatial correlations can be neglected in many cases,\nopening the door to studies on a single grain. Our work develops a Monte Carlo\nmethod to sample the force ensemble on a single grain at constant angoricity on\ntwo and three-dimensional mono-disperse granular systems, both with or without\nstatic friction. The results show that, despite the steric exclusions and the\nconstrictions of Coulomb's limit and repulsive normal forces, the pressure per\ngrain always show a gamma distribution with scale parameter {\\nu} =\n{\\alpha}^{-1} and shape parameter k close to k', the number of degrees of\nfreedom in the system. Moreover, the average pressure per grain fulfills an\nequipartition theorem <p>=k'{\\alpha}^{-1} in all cases (in close parallelism\nwith the one for an ideal gas). These results suggest the existence of k'\nindependent random variables (i.e. elementary forces) with identical\nexponential distributions as the basic elements for describing the force\nnetwork ensemble at low angoricities under isotropic compression, in analogy\nwith the volume ensemble of granular materials.\n", "  The migration characteristics of a suspended deformable droplet in a parallel\nplate microchannel is studied, both analytically and numerically, under the\ncombined influence of a constant temperature gradient in the transverse\ndirection and an imposed pressure driven flow. Any predefined transverse\nposition in the micro channel can be attained by the droplet depending on the\napplied temperature gradient in the cross-stream direction or how small the\ndroplet is with respect to the channel width. For the analytical solution, an\nasymptotic approach is used, where we neglect any effect of inertia or thermal\nconvection of the fluid in either of the phases. To obtain a numerical\nsolution, we use the conservative level set method. Variation of temperature in\nthe flow field causes a jump in the tangential component of stress at the\ndroplet interface. This jump in stress component, which is the thermal\nMarangoni stress, is an important factor that controls the trajectory of the\ndroplet. The direction of cross-stream migration of the droplet is decided by\nthe magnitude of the critical Marangoni stress, corresponding to which the\ndroplet remains stationary. In order to analyze practical microfluidic setup,\nwe do numerical simulations where we consider wall effects as well as the\neffect of thermal convection and finite shape deformation on the cross-stream\nmigration of the droplet.\n", "  The butterfly velocity was recently proposed as a characteristic velocity of\nchaos propagation in a local system. Compared to the Lieb-Robinson velocity\nthat bounds the propagation speed of all perturbations, the butterfly velocity,\nstudied in thermal ensembles, is an \"effective\" Lieb-Robinson velocity for a\nsubspace of the Hilbert space defined by the microcanonical ensemble. In this\npaper, we generalize the concept of butterfly velocity beyond the thermal case\nto a large class of other subspaces. Based on holographic duality, we consider\nthe code subspace of low energy excitations on a classical background geometry.\nUsing local reconstruction of bulk operators, we prove a general relation\nbetween the boundary butterfly velocities (of different operators) and the bulk\ncausal structure. Our result has implications in both directions of the\nbulk-boundary correspondence. Starting from a boundary theory with a given\nLieb-Robinson velocity, our result determines an upper bound of the bulk light\ncone starting from a given point. Starting from a bulk space-time geometry, the\nbutterfly velocity can be explicitly calculated for all operators that are the\nlocal reconstructions of bulk local operators. If the bulk geometry satisfies\nEinstein equation and the null energy condition, for rotation symmetric\ngeometries we prove that infrared operators always have a slower butterfly\nvelocity that the ultraviolet one. For asymptotic AdS geometries, this also\nimplies that the butterfly velocities of all operators are upper bounded by the\nspeed of light. We further prove that the butterfly velocity is equal to the\nspeed of light if the causal wedge of the boundary region coincides with its\nentanglement wedge. Finally, we discuss the implication of our result to\ngeometries that are not asymptotically AdS, and in particular, obtain\nconstraints that must be satisfied by a dual theory of flat space gravity.\n", "  We study the dissipative Rabi model under deep strong far-off-resonant\ndriving when the driving frequency and strength exceed significantly the qubit\ntransition frequency. We find analytical expressions for the density matrix,\nthe steady-state first-order field correlation function and the multiphoton\nemission spectrum. This spectrum consists of a series of narrow delta-like\nlines, caused by coherent processes and of Lorenzian peaks resulted from the\nincoherent scattering of photons. It is shown that the width of emission lines\nas well as the decay rate of the time oscillations in the population difference\nhave oscillating dependence on the driving strength. We show how the features\nof this dependence are controlled by the relative rates of energetic relaxation\nand pure dephasing.\n", "  We derive the spectral decomposition of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for\nelectrodynamics, obtaining the fields as a sum of eigenmodes. The method is\napplied to cylindrical geometries.\n", "  Rydberg blockade of ultracold atoms is considered now as one of the most\npromising tools for the implementation of quantum computing, but its fidelity\ncan be substantially compromised by detrimental excitation of the neighbouring\natoms. This phenomenon has been investigated recently in detail for the\nparticular case of molecular resonances (i.e., resulting in the formation of\nquasi-bound states). However, as will be shown in the present paper, an even\ngreater effect can come from the non-molecular resonances, which therefore\nshould be taken into account very carefully.\n", "  The investigation of optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional\nmaterials and their heterostructures is a very active area of investigation\nwith both fundamental and applied aspects involved. We present a description of\na home-built scanning photocurrent microscope that we have designed and\ndeveloped to perform electronic transport and optical measurements of\ntwo-dimensional materials based devices. The complete system is rather\ninexpensive (<10000 EUR) and it can be easily replicated in any laboratory. To\nillustrate the setup we measure current-voltage characteristics, in dark and\nunder global illumination, of an ultra-thin PN junction formed by the stacking\nof an n-doped few-layer MoS2 flake onto a p-type MoS2 flake. We then acquire\nscanning photocurrent maps and by mapping the short circuit current generated\nin the device under local illumination we find that at zero bias the\nphotocurrent is generated mostly in the region of overlap between the n-type\nand p-type flakes.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) represents the next generation of\nground-based instruments for very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy, aimed\nat improving on the sensitivity of current-generation experiments by an order\nof magnitude and providing coverage over four decades of energy. The current\nCTA design consists of two arrays of tens of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov\ntelescopes, comprising Small, Medium and Large-Sized Telescopes, with one array\nlocated in each of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. To study the effect\nof the site choice on the overall \\gls{cta} performance and support the site\nevaluation process, detailed Monte Carlo simulations have been performed. These\nresults show the impact of different site-related attributes such as altitude,\nnight-sky background and local geomagnetic field on CTA performance for the\nobservation of VHE gamma rays.\n", "  We construct a point transformation between two integrable systems, the\nmulti-component Harry Dym equation and the multi-component extended Harry Dym\nequation, that does not preserve the class of multi-phase solutions. As a\nconsequence we obtain a new type of wave-like solutions, generalising\nthe~multi-phase solutions of the multi-component extended Harry Dym equation.\nOur construction is easily transferable to other integrable systems with\nanalogous properties.\n", "  The shock L1157-B1 driven by the low-mass protostar L1157-mm is an unique\nenvironment to investigate the chemical enrichment due to molecules released\nfrom dust grains. IRAM-30m and Plateau de Bure Interferometer observations\nallow a census of Si-bearing molecules in L1157-B1. We detect SiO and its\nisotopologues and, for the first time in a shock, SiS. The strong gradient of\nthe [SiO/SiS] abundance ratio across the shock (from >=180 to ~25) points to a\ndifferent chemical origin of the two species. SiO peaks where the jet impacts\nthe cavity walls ([SiO/H2] ~ 1e-6), indicating that SiO is directly released\nfrom grains or rapidly formed from released Si in the strong shock occurring at\nthis location. In contrast, SiS is only detected at the head of the cavity\nopened by previous ejection events ([SiS/H2] ~ 2e-8). This suggests that SiS is\nnot directly released from the grain cores but instead should be formed through\nslow gas-phase processes using part of the released silicon. This finding shows\nthat Si-bearing molecules can be useful to distinguish regions where grains or\ngas-phase chemistry dominates.\n", "  X-ray emission in young stellar objects (YSOs) is orders of magnitude more\nintense than in main sequence stars1,2, suggestive of cosmic ray irradiation of\nsurrounding accretion disks. Protoplanetary disk irradiation has been detected\naround YSOs by HERSCHEL3. In our solar system, short-lived 10Be (half-life =\n1.39 My4), which cannot be produced by stellar nucleosynthesis, was discovered\nin the oldest solar system solids, the calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions\n(CAIs)5. The high 10Be abundance, as well as detection of other irradiation\ntracers6,7, suggest 10Be likely originates from cosmic ray irradiation caused\nby solar flares8. Nevertheless, the nature of these flares (gradual or\nimpulsive), the target (gas or dust), and the duration and location of\nirradiation remain unknown. Here we use the vanadium isotopic composition,\ntogether with initial 10Be abundance to quantify irradiation conditions in the\nearly Solar System9. For the initial 10Be abundances recorded in CAIs, 50V\nexcesses of a few per mil relative to chondrites have been predicted10,11. We\nreport 50V excesses in CAIs up to 4.4 per mil that co-vary with 10Be abundance.\nTheir co-variation dictates that excess 50V and 10Be were synthesised through\nirradiation of refractory dust. Modelling of the production rate of 50V and\n10Be demonstrates that the dust was exposed to solar cosmic rays produced by\ngradual flares for less than 300 years at about 0.1 au from the protoSun.\n", "  Magnetic activity and rotation are known to be intimately linked for low-mass\nstars. Understanding rotation evolution over the stellar lifetime is therefore\nan important goal within stellar astrophysics. In recent years, there has been\nincreased focus on how the complexity of the stellar magnetic field affects the\nrate of angular momentum-loss from a star. This is a topic that Zeeman-Doppler\nimaging (ZDI), a technique that is capable of reconstructing the large-scale\nmagnetic field topology of a star, can uniquely address.\n  Using a potential field source surface model, we estimate the open flux, mass\nloss-rate and angular momentum-loss rates for a sample of 66 stars that have\nbeen mapped with ZDI. We show that the open flux of a star is predominantly\ndetermined by the dipolar component of its magnetic field for our choice of\nsource surface radius. We also show that, on the main sequence, the open flux,\nmass- and angular momentum-loss rates increase with decreasing Rossby number.\nThe exception to this rule is stars less massive than $0.3M_{\\odot}$. Previous\nwork suggests that low mass M dwarfs may possess either strong, ordered and\ndipolar fields or weak and complex fields. This range of field strengths\nresults in a large spread of angular momentum-loss rates for these stars and\nhas important consequences for their spin down behaviour. Additionally, our\nmodels do not predict a transition in the mass-loss rates at the so called wind\ndividing line noted from Ly$\\alpha$ studies.\n", "  Neutrino masses are one of the most promising open windows to physics beyond\nthe Standard Model (SM). Several extensions of the SM which accommodate\nneutrino masses require the addition of right-handed neutrinos to its particle\ncontent. These extra fermions will either be kinematically accessible (sterile\nneutrinos) or not (deviations from Unitarity of the PMNS matrix) but at some\npoint they will impact neutrino oscillation searches. We explore the\ndifferences and similitudes between the two cases and compare their present\nbounds with the expected sensitivities of DUNE. We conclude that Non-Unitarity\n(NU) effects are too constrained to impact present or near future neutrino\noscillation facilities but that sterile neutrinos can play an important role at\nlong baseline experiments.\n", "  In high-entropy alloys (HEAs), the local chemical fluctuations from\ndisordered solute solution state into segregation, precipitation and ordering\nconfigurations are complex due to the large number of elements. In this work,\nthe cluster expansion (CE) Hamiltonian for multi-component alloy systems is\ndeveloped in order to investigate the dependence of chemical ordering of HEAs\nas a function of temperature dependence due to derivation of configuration\nentropy from the ideal solute solution. Analytic expressions for Warren-Cowley\nshort-range order (SRO) parameters are derived for a five component alloy\nsystem. The theoretical formulation is used to investigate the evolution of the\nten different SRO parameters in the MoNbTaVW and the sub-quaternary systems\nobtained by MonteCarlo simulations within the combined CE and first-principles\nformalism.\n", "  We describe the methodology and novel techniques used to construct a set of\nwaveforms, or template bank, applicable to searches for compact binary\ncoalescences in Advanced LIGO's second observing run. This template bank is\nsuitable for observing systems composed of two neutron stars, two black holes,\nor a neutron star and a black hole. The Post-Newtonian formulation is used to\nmodel waveforms with total mass less than 4 $M_{\\odot}$ and the most recent\neffective-one-body model, calibrated to numerical relativity to include the\nmerger and ringdown, is used for total masses greater than 4 $M_{\\odot}$. The\neffects of spin precession, matter, orbital eccentricity and radiation modes\nbeyond the quadrupole are neglected. In contrast to the template bank used to\nsearch for compact binary mergers in Advanced LIGO's first observing run, here\nwe are including binary-black-hole systems with total mass up to several\nhundreds of solar masses, thereby improving the ability to observe such\nsystems. We introduce a technique to vary the starting frequency of waveform\nfilters so that our bank can simultaneously contain binary-neutron-star and\nhigh-mass binary-black hole waveforms. We also introduce a lower-bound on the\nfilter waveform length, to exclude very short-duration, high-mass templates\nwhose sensitivity is strongly reduced by the characteristics and performance of\nthe interferometers.\n", "  In this paper we endeavour to determine the energy levels of an atom by\nvirtue of the modified Dirac equation. It has been found that the energy levels\ncontain an extra term in the expression which accounts for the {\\it\nzitterbewegung} effects in the Compton scale. Applying our perspective to the\nhydrogen atom we have been able to find the {\\it Lamb shift} for the\n$2S_{\\frac{1}{2}}$ and $2P_{\\frac{1}{2}}$ states. This result substantiates\nthat a slight modification of the Dirac equation suffices to explain the\nphenomenon, where the modification of the Dirac equation arises due to the\nnon-commutative nature of space-time. Besides, several other unexplained\nphenomena can emerge as a natural consequence of this modification\n", "  This is a summary of the recent PHYSTAT-$\\nu$ Workshops in Japan and at\nFermilab, on `Statistical Issues in Experimental Neutrino Physics'.\n", "  The main features of the statistical approach to inverse problems are\ndescribed on the example of a linear model with additive noise. The approach\ndoes not use any Bayesian hypothesis regarding an unknown object; instead, the\nstandard statistical requirements for the procedure for finding a desired\nobject estimate are presented. In this way, it is possible to obtain stable and\nefficient inverse solutions in the framework of classical statistical theory.\nThe exact representation is given for the feasible region of inverse solutions,\ni.e., the set of inverse estimates that are in agreement, in the statistical\nsense, with the data and available a priory information. The typical feasible\nregion has the form of an extremely elongated hole ellipsoid, the orientation\nand shape of which are determined by the Fisher information matrix. It is the\nspectrum of the Fisher matrix that provides an exhaustive description of the\nstability of the inverse problem under consideration. The method of\nconstructing a nonlinear filter close to the optimal Kolmogorov-Wiener filter\nis presented.\n", "  Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) with a mass between $10^{2}$ and\n$10^{5}$ times that of the sun, which bridges the {mass gap between the}\nstellar-mass black holes and the supermassive black holes, are crucial in\nunderstanding the evolution of the black holes. Although they are widely\nbelieved to exist, decisive evidence has long been absent. Motivated by the\nsuccessful detection of massive stellar-mass black holes by advanced LIGO,\nthrough the gravitational wave radiation during the binary merger, in this work\nwe investigate the prospect of detecting/identifying the lightest IMBHs\n(LIMBHs; the black holes $\\gtrsim 100M_\\odot$) with the second generation\ngravitational wave detectors. In general, the chance of hearing the birth of\nthe LIMBHs is significantly higher than that to identify pre-merger IMBHs. The\nother formation channel of LIMBHs, where stars with huge mass/low-metallicity\ndirectly collapse, is likely \"silent\", so the merger-driven birth of the LIMBHs\nmay be the only \"observable\" scenario in the near future. Moreover, the\nprospect of establishing the presence of (lightest) intermediate mass black\nholes in the O3 run and beyond of advanced LIGO is found quite promising,\nimplying that such an instrument could make another breakthrough on astronomy\nin the near future. The joining of other detectors like advanced Virgo would\nonly increase the detection rate.\n", "  We investigate quantum turbulence in a two-dimensional trapped supersolid and\ndemonstrate that both the wave and vortex turbulence involve triple rather than\ndual cascades, as in a superfluid. Because of the presence of a second gapless\nmode associated with translation symmetry breaking, a new $k^{-13/3}$ scaling\nlaw is predicted to occur in the wave turbulence. Simultaneous fast\nvortex-antivortex creation and annihilation in the interior of the oscillating\nsupersolid results in a $k^{-1}$ scaling law in the vortex turbulence.\nNumerical simulations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation confirmed the\npredictions.\n", "  Environmental pollution, comprising of air, water and soil have emerged as a\nserious problem in past two decades. The air pollution is caused by\ncontamination of air due to various natural and anthropogenic activities. The\ngrowing air pollution has diverse adverse effects on human health and other\nliving species. However, a significant reduction in the concentration of air\npollutants has been observed during the rainy season. Recently, a number of\nstudies have been performed to understand the mechanism of removal of air\npollutants due to the rain. These studies have found that rain is helpful in\nremoving many air pollutants from the environment. In this paper, we proposed a\nmathematical model to investigate the role of rain in removal of air pollutants\nand its subsequent impacts on human population.\n", "  A new approach to description of hadron spectroscopy is proposed. By\nassumption, the form of spectrum is dictated by the trace of energy momentum\ntensor in QCD. This provides the relativistic and renormalization invariance of\nhadron masses. The constructed scheme is applied to the light mesons for which\ntwo complementary interpretations are worked out. The first one represents an\n\"atomic\" structure of resonances above 1 GeV in which the quanta of\nnon-perturbative gluon contributions are quantified via an effective formation\nof quasiparticles representing likely gluon analogues of positronium. This\npicture allows to build a \"periodic table of the hadronic elements\", i.e. to\nclassify hadrons, in some sense, in analogy with Mendeleev table in chemistry.\nThe classification does not require introduction of the orbital angular\nmomentum associated with hadron constituents. The Regge and radial trajectories\nemerge in a natural way. The second interpretation is based on a \"collisional\"\nnature of some (or many) hadrons, specifically of scalar resonances below 1\nGeV. Here the role of quasiparticles is played by another hadron. This picture\nin particular leads to a simple explanation of the puzzling scalar sector below\n1 GeV with correct predictions for masses and dominant decay modes.\n", "  We investigate the effects of Raman and Kerr gain in crystalline\nmicroresonators and determine the conditions required to generate modelocked\nfrequency combs. We show theoretically that strong, narrowband Raman gain\ndetermines a maximum microresonator size allowable to achieve comb formation.\nWe verify this condition experimentally in diamond and silicon microresonators\nand show that there exists a competition between Raman and Kerr effects that\nleads to the existence of two different comb states.\n", "  Microwave plasma discharges working at low pressure are nowadays a\nwell-developed technique mainly used to provide radiations at different\nwavelengths. The aim of this work is to show that those discharges are an\nefficient windowless VUV photon source for planetary atmospheric photochemistry\nexperiments. To do this, we use a surfatron-type discharge with a neon gas flow\nin the mbar pressure range coupled to a photochemical reactor. Working in the\nVUV range allows to focus on nitrogen-dominated atmospheres ({\\lambda}<100nm).\nThe experimental setup makes sure that no other energy sources (electrons,\nmetastable atoms) than the VUV photons interact with the reactive medium. Neon\nowns two resonance lines at 73.6 and 74.3 nm which behave differently regarding\nthe pressure or power conditions. In parallel, the VUV photon flux emitted at\n73.6 nm has been experimentally estimated in different conditions of pressure\nand power and varies in a large range between 2x1013 ph.s-1.cm-2 and 4x1014\nph.s-1.cm-2 which is comparable to a VUV synchrotron photon flux. Our first\ncase study is the atmosphere of Titan and its N2-CH4 atmosphere. With this VUV\nsource, the production of HCN and C2N2, two major Titan compounds, is detected,\nensuring the suitability of the source for atmospheric photochemistry\nexperiments.\n", "  Two sorts of solid organic samples can be produced in laboratory experiments\nsimulating Titan atmospheric reactivity: grains in the volume and thin films on\nthe reactor walls. We expect that grains are more representative of Titan\natmospheric aerosols, but films are used to provide optical indices for\nradiative models of Titan atmosphere. The aim of the present study is to\naddress if these two sorts of analogues are chemically equivalent or not, when\nproduced in the same N2-CH4 plasma discharge. The chemical compositions of both\nthese materials are measured by using elemental analysis, XPS analysis and\nSecondary Ion Mass Spectrometry. The main parameter probed is the CH4 N2 ratio\nto explore various possible chemical regimes. We find that films are\nhomogeneous but significantly less rich in nitrogen and hydrogen than grains\nproduced in the same experimental conditions. This surprising difference in\ntheir chemical compositions could be explained by the efficient etching\noccurring on the films, which stay in the discharge during the whole plasma\nduration, whereas the grains are ejected after a few minutes. The higher\nnitrogen content in the grains possibly involves a higher optical absorption\nthan the one measured on the films, with a possible impact on Titan radiative\nmodels.\n", "  The development of spintronic technology with increasingly dense, high-speed,\nand complex devices will be accelerated by accessible microscopy techniques\ncapable of probing magnetic phenomena on picosecond time scales and at deeply\nsub-micron length scales. A recently developed time-resolved magneto-thermal\nmicroscope provides a path towards this goal if it is augmented with a\npicosecond, nanoscale heat source. We theoretically study adiabatic\nnanofocusing and near-field heat induction using conical gold plasmonic\nantennas to generate sub-100 nm thermal gradients for time-resolved\nmagneto-thermal imaging. Finite element calculations of antenna-sample\ninteractions reveal focused electromagnetic loss profiles that are either\npeaked directly under the antenna or are annular, depending on the sample's\nconductivity, the antenna's apex radius, and the tip-sample separation. We find\nthat the thermal gradient is confined to 40 nm to 60 nm full width at half\nmaximum for realistic ranges of sample conductivity and apex radius. To\nmitigate this variation, which is undesirable for microscopy, we investigate\nthe use of a platinum capping layer on top of the sample as a thermal\ntransduction layer to produce heat uniformly across different sample materials.\nAfter determining the optimal capping layer thickness, we simulate the\nevolution of the thermal gradient in the underlying sample layer, and find that\nthe temporal width is below 10 ps. These results lay a theoretical foundation\nfor nanoscale, time-resolved magneto-thermal imaging.\n", "  The chemical composition of Titan organic haze is poorly known. To address\nthis issue, laboratory analogs named tholins are synthesized, and analyzed by\nmethods requiring often an extraction process in a carrier solvent. These\nmethods exclude the analysis of the insoluble tholins fraction and assume a\nhypothetical chemical equivalence between soluble and insoluble fractions. In\nthis work, we present a powerful complementary analysis method recently\ndeveloped on the DESIRS VUV synchrotron beamline at SOLEIL. It involves a soft\npyrolysis of tholins at ~230 deg C and an electron ion coincidence analysis of\nthe emitted volatiles compounds photoionized by the tunable synchrotron\nradiation. By comparison with reference photoelectron spectra (PES), the\nspectral information collected on the detected molecules yields their isomeric\nstructure. The method is more readily applied to light species, while for\nheavier ones the number of possibilities and the lack of PES reference spectra\nin the literature limit its analysis. A notable pattern in the analyzed tholins\nis the presence of species containing adjacent doubly-bonded N atoms, which\nmight be a signature of heterogeneous incorporation of N2 in tholins.\n", "  Cepheid stars are crucial objects for a variety of topics that range from\nstellar pulsation and the evolution of intermediate-mass stars to the\nunderstanding the structure of the Galaxy and the Universe through the distance\nmeasurements they provide. The developments in hydrodynamical calculations, the\nrelease of large ground-based surveys, and the advent of continuous,\nspace-based photometry revealed many puzzling phenomena about these stars in\nthe last few years. In this paper I collected some important and new results in\nthe topics of distance measurements and binarity investigations. I also\nsummarize the most recent discoveries in their light variations, such as period\ndoubling, modulation, low-amplitude additional modes, period jitter and the\nsigns of granulation, and discuss the new opportunities that current and future\nspace missions will offer for us.\n", "  The MOST space telescope observed four Cepheid variables so far, all of\ndifferent subtypes. Here we summarize the results obtained and the possible\nways to continue to study these stars.\n", "  We define two families of Poissonian soups of bidirectional trajectories on\n$\\mathbb{Z}^2$, which can be seen to adequately describe the local picture of\nthe trace left by a random walk on the two-dimensional torus $(\\mathbb{Z}/N\n\\mathbb{Z})^2$, started from the uniform distribution, run up to a time of\norder $(N\\log N)^2$ and forced to avoid a fixed point. The local limit of the\nlatter was recently established in arXiv:1502.03470. Our construction proceeds\nby considering, somewhat in the spirit of statistical mechanics, a sequence of\nfinite-volume approximations, consisting of random walks avoiding the origin\nand killed at spatial scale $N$, either using Dirichlet boundary conditions, or\nby means of a suitably adjusted mass. By tuning the intensity $u$ of such walks\nwith $N$, the occupation field can be seen to have a nontrivial limit,\ncorresponding to that of the actual random walk. Our construction thus yields a\ntwo-dimensional analogue of the random interlacements model introduced in\narXiv:0704.2560 in the transient case. It also links it to the pinned free\nfield in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, by means of a (pinned) Ray-Knight type isomorphism\ntheorem.\n"]}
