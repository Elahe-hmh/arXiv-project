According to the\nUT E in one frame is 'seen' as E' and B' in a relatively moving frame. In\nMinkowski's last paper, in 1908. in section 11.6, he defined the vectors (with\nfour components) of the electric $\\Phi $ and magnetic $\\Psi $ fields and\ndiscovered that, e.g., $\\Phi $ correctly transforms by the LT again to $\\Phi\n^{\\prime}$. His correct LT are reinvented in, e.g., [11] ([11] Ivezi\\'{c} T\n2005 Found. Phys. Lett. 18 301). In this paper we show the essential similarity\nand some differences between Minkowski's relations in section 11.6 and the\nresults obtained in [11]. The low-velocity limit of the UT and the LT is\nbriefly examined. A short discussion of the comparison with the Trouton-Noble\nexperiment is presented.\n", "  My answer to the question in the title is \"No\". In support of this point of\nview, we analyze some examples of saddle-point methods, especially as applied\nto quantum \"tunneling\" in nonrelativistic particle mechanics and in cosmology.\nAlong the way we explore some of the interrelationships among different ways of\nthinking about path-integrals and saddle-point approximations to them.\n", "  We derive a Toda-type recurrence relation, in both high and low temperature\nregimes, for the $\\lambda$ - extended diagonal correlation functions\n$C(N,N;\\lambda)$ of the two-dimensional Ising model, using an earlier\nconnection between diagonal form factor expansions and tau-functions within\nPainlev\\'e VI (PVI) theory, originally discovered by Jimbo and Miwa. This\ngreatly simplifies the calculation of the diagonal correlation functions,\nparticularly their $\\lambda$-extended counterparts. We also conjecture a closed\nform expression for the simplest off-diagonal case $C^{\\pm}(0,1;\\lambda)$ where\na connection to PVI theory is not known. Combined with the results for diagonal\ncorrelations these give all the initial conditions required for the\n$\\l$-extended version of quadratic difference equations for the correlation\nfunctions discovered by McCoy, Perk and Wu. The results obtained here should\nprovide a further potential algorithmic improvement in the $\\l$-extended case,\nand facilitate other developments.\n", "  In this article we investigate the effects of shifting position decoherence,\narisen from the tunneling effect in the experimental realization of the quantum\nwalk, on the one-dimensional discreet time quantum walk. We show that in the\nregime of this type of noise the quantum behavior of the walker does not fade,\nin contrary to the coin decoherence for which the walker undergos the\nquantum-to-classical transition even for weak noise. Particularly, we show that\nthe quadratic dependency of the variance on the time and also the coin-position\nentanglement, i.e. two important quantum aspects of the coherent quantum walk,\nare preserved in the presence of tunneling decoherence. Furthermore, we present\nan explicit expression for the probability distribution of decoherent\none-dimensional quantum walk in terms of the corresponding coherent\nprobabilities, and show that this type of decoherence smooths the probability\ndistribution.\n", "  In this paper a formulation of the field equation for moving media is\ndeveloped by the generalization of an axiomatic geometric formulation of the\nelectromagnetism in vacuum (Ivezi\\'{c} T 2005 Found. Phys. Lett. 18 401. First,\nthe field equations with bivectors F(x) and \\mathcal{M}(x) are presented and\nthen these equations are written with vectors E(x), B(x), P(x) and M(x). The\nlatter ones contain both the velocity vector u of a moving medium and the\nvelocity vector v of the observers who measure E and B fields. They do not\nappear in the entire previous literature. All these equations are written in\nthe standard basis and compared with Maxwell's equations with 3-vectors. In\nthis approach the Amp\\`{e}r-Maxwell law and Gauss's law are inseparably\nconnected in one law and the same happens with Faraday's law and the law that\nexpresses the absence of magnetic charge. It is shown that Maxwell's equations\nwith 3-vectors and our field equations with 4D geometric quantities are not\nequivalent in the 4D spacetime.\n", "  We prove the existence of nontrivial finite energy traveling waves for a\nlarge class of nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations with nonzero conditions at\ninfinity (includindg the Gross-Pitaevskii and the so-called \"cubic-quintic\"\nequations) in space dimension $ N \\geq 2$. We show that minimization of the\nenergy at fixed momentum can be used whenever the associated nonlinear\npotential is nonnegative and it gives a set of orbitally stable traveling\nwaves, while minimization of the action at constant kinetic energy can be used\nin all cases. We also explore the relationship between the families of\ntraveling waves obtained by different methods and we prove a sharp nonexistence\nresult for traveling waves with small energy.\n", "  In the first part of this paper we review the fundamental difference between\nthe usual transformations of the three-dimensional (3D) vectors of the electric\nfield $\\mathbf{E}$, the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$, the polarization\n$\\mathbf{P}$, the magnetization $\\mathbf{M}$ and the Lorentz transformations of\nthe 4D geometric quantities, vectors E, B, P, M, with many additional\nexplanations and several new results. In the second part, we have discussed the\nexistence of the electric field vector E outside a stationary superconducting\nwire with a steady current and also different experiments for the detection of\nsuch electric fields. Furthermore, a fundamental prediction of the existence of\nthe external electric field vector E from a stationary permanent magnet is\nconsidered. These electric fields are used for the resolution of the\n\"charge-magnet paradox\" with 4D geometric quantities for a qualitative\nexplanation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in terms of fields and not, as usual,\nin terms of the vector potential and for a qualitative explanation that the\nparticle interference is not a test of a Lorentz-violating model of\nelectrodynamics according to which a magnetic solenoid generates not only a\nstatic magnetic field but also a static electric field.\n", "  The simple model which enables to take into account the effects of a colour\nstring fusion in pp interactions is suggested. The parameters of the model are\nconnected with the parameters of the pomeron trajectory and its couplings to\nhadrons. On the base of the model the MC algorithm which enables to calculate\nthe long-range correlation functions between multiplicities and between the\naverage transverse momentum and the multiplicity in pp collisions is developed.\n", "  The forward-backward (FB) multiplicity correlations in two windows separated\nin rapidity and azimuth are analyzed in the framework of the model with\nindependent identical emitters (strings). Along with the short-range\ncontribution, originating from the correlation between particles produced by a\nsingle string, the long-range contribution, originating from the fluctuation in\nthe number of strings, is taken into account. The connection of the FB\nmultiplicity correlation coefficient with the two-particle correlation function\nand the di-hadron correlation analysis is traced. It's also shown that the\ndirect azimuthal flow leads to the forward ridge structure in the resulting\ntwo-particle correlation function.\n", "  In this work, we discuss the quantum mechanics of many-body systems i.e.\nhybrid microgel consisting of negatively charged anionic microgels possessing\nthick sheath of water molecules solvating its protruding anionic moieties and\nnanoparticle captivated with in it. Thermodynamic feasibility of synthesis of\nparticular nanoparticle with in the microgel is dependent upon the magnitude of\ninteraction between nanoparticle, water molecules and microgel relative to sum\nof magnitude of self-interaction between counterions and interaction between\ncounterions and microgel. Nanoparticles synthesized with in the microgels have\nthick electronic cloud that oscillates under the influence of net interaction\npotential of charged anionic moieties and solvent water molecules. Hamiltonian\ndescribing energy of oscillating electronic cloud wrapped around nanoparticle\nis mathematically derived to be equal to product of integral of electron\ndensity and its position vector overall space multiplied with net electric\nforce acting on the oscillating electronic cloud of nanoparticle.\n", "  Several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) last much longer (~hours) in gamma-rays than\ntypical long GRBs (~ minutes), and recently it was proposed that these\n\"ultra-long GRBs\" may form a distinct population, probably with a different\n(e.g. blue supergiant) progenitor than typical GRBs. However, Swift\nobservations suggest that many GRBs have extended central engine activities\nmanifested as flares and internal plateaus in X-rays. We perform a\ncomprehensive study on a large sample of Swift GRBs with XRT observations to\ninvestigate GRB central engine activity duration and to determine whether\nultra-long GRBs are unusual events. We define burst duration t_burst based on\nboth gamma-ray and X-ray light curves rather than using gamma-ray observations\nalone. We find that t_burst can be reliably measured in 343 GRBs. Within this\n\"good\" sample, 21.9% GRBs have t_burst >=10^3 s and 11.5% GRBs have t_burst\n>=10^4 s. There is an apparent bimodal distribution of t_burst in this sample.\nHowever, when we consider an \"undetermined\" sample (304 GRBs) with t_burst\npossibly falling in the gap between GRB duration T_90 and the first X-ray\nobservational time, as well as a selection effect against t_burst falling into\nthe first Swift orbital \"dead zone\" due to observation constraints, the\nintrinsic underlying t_burst distribution is consistent with being a single\ncomponent distribution. We found that the existing evidence for a separate\nultra-long GRB population is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength\nobservations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion. We also discuss the\ntheoretical implications of our results. In particular, the central engine\nactivity duration of GRBs is generally much longer than the gamma-ray T90\nduration and it does not even correlate with T90. It would be premature to make\na direct connection between T90 and the size of the progenitor star.\n", "  Intuition from our everyday lives gives rise to the belief that information\nexchanged between remote parties is carried by physical particles.\nSurprisingly, in a recent theoretical study [Salih H, Li ZH, Al-Amri M, Zubairy\nMS (2013) Phys Rev Lett 110:170502], quantum mechanics was found to allow for\ncommunication, even without the actual transmission of physical particles. From\nthe viewpoint of communication, this mystery stems from a (nonintuitive)\nfundamental concept in quantum mechanics wave-particle duality. All particles\ncan be described fully by wave functions. To determine whether light appears in\na channel, one refers to the amplitude of its wave function. However, in\ncounterfactual communication, information is carried by the phase part of the\nwave function. Using a single-photon source, we experimentally demonstrate the\ncounterfactual communication and successfully transfer a monochrome bitmap from\none location to another by using a nested version of the quantum Zeno effect.\n", "  We report the synthesis and characterization of Li2ZnV3O8, which is a new\nZn-doped LiV2O4 system containing only tetravalent vanadium. A Curie-Weiss\nsusceptibility with a Curie-Weiss temperature of <theta>CW ~214 K suggests the\npresence of strong antiferromagnetic correlations in this system. We have\nobserved a splitting between the zero-field cooled ZFC and field cooled FC\nsusceptibility curves below 6 K. A peak is present in the ZFC curve around 3.5\nK suggestive of spin-freezing . Similarly, a broad hump is also seen in the\ninferred magnetic heat capacity around 9 K. The consequent entropy change is\nonly about 8% of the value expected for an ordered S = 1=2 system. This\nreduction indicates continued presence of large disorder in the system in spite\nof the large <theta>CW, which might result from strong geometric frustration in\nthe system. We did not find any temperature T dependence in our 7Li nuclear\nmagnetic resonance NMR shift down to 6 K (an abrupt change in the shift takes\nplace below 6 K) though considerable T-dependence has been found in literature\nfor LiV2O4- undoped or with other Zn/Ti contents. Consistent with the above\nobservation, the 7Li nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 is relatively\nsmall and nearly T-independent except a small increase close to the freezing\ntemperature, once again, small compared to undoped or 10% Zn or 20% Ti-doped\nLiV2O4.\n", "  It is demonstrated that Maxwell's demon can be used to allow a machine to\nextract energy from a heat bath by use of information that is processed by the\ndemon at a remote location. The model proposed here effectively replaces\ntransmission of energy by transmission of information. For that we use a\nfeedback protocol that enables a net gain by stimulating emission in selected\nfluctuations around thermal equilibrium. We estimate the down conversion rate\nand the efficiency of energy extraction from the heat bath.\n", "  We look into the signatures of the effective Y-bosonic strings in the gluonic\nprofile due to a system of three static quarks on the lattice. The gluonic\ndistribution is calculated in pure Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory at finite\ntemperature with Polyakov loops operators. The analysis of the action density\nunveils a filled-$\\Delta$ distribution. However, we found that these\n$\\Delta$-shaped action density profiles are structured from three Y-shaped\nGaussian-like flux-tubes. The length of the revealed Y-flux system increases\nwith the increasing of the color source separation and reaches maximum near the\ndeconfinement point. The lattice data for the mean-square width of the gluonic\naction density have been compared to the corresponding width calculated based\non the string model at finite temperature. We assume Y-string configuration\nwith minimal length. The growth pattern of the action density of the gluonic\nfield fits well to junction fluctuations of the Y-baryonic string model for\nlarge quark separation at the considered temperatures.\n", "  The standard Bloch sphere representation was recently generalized to the\n'extended Bloch representation' describing not only systems of arbitrary\ndimension, but also their measurements. This model solves the measurement\nproblem and is based on the 'hidden-measurement interpretation', according to\nwhich the Born rule results from our lack of knowledge about the interaction\nbetween measuring apparatus and the measured entity. We present here the\nextended Bloch model and use it to investigate the nature of quantum spin and\nits relation to our Euclidean space. We show that spin eigenstates cannot\ngenerally be associated with directions in the Euclidean space, but only with\ngeneralized directions in the Blochean space, which generally is a space of\nhigher dimension. Hence, spin entities have to be considered as genuine\nnon-spatial entities. We also show, however, that specific vectors can be\nidentified in the Blochean theater that are isomorphic to the Euclidean space\ndirections, and therefore representative of them, and that spin eigenstates\nalways have a predetermined orientation with respect to them. We use the\ndetails of our results to put forward a new view of realism, that we call\n'multiplex realism', providing a specific framework with which to interpret the\nhuman observations and understanding of the component parts of the world.\nElements of reality can be represented in different theaters, one being our\ncustomary Euclidean space, and another one the quantum realm, revealed to us\nthrough our sophisticated experiments, whose elements of reality, in the\nquantum jargon, are the eigenvalues and eigenstates. Our understanding of the\ncomponent parts of the world can then be guided by looking for the possible\nconnections, in the form of partial morphisms, between the different\nrepresentations, which is precisely what we do in this article with regard to\nspin entities.\n", "  In this paper we propose a mathematical model for the onset and progression\nof Alzheimer's disease based on transport and diffusion equations. We regard\nbrain neurons as a continuous medium, and structure them by their degree of\nmalfunctioning. Two different mechanisms are assumed to be relevant for the\ntemporal evolution of the disease: i) diffusion and agglomeration of soluble\npolymers of amyloid, produced by damaged neurons; ii) neuron-to-neuron\nprion-like transmission. We model these two processes by a system of\nSmoluchowski equations for the amyloid concentration, coupled to a kinetic-type\ntransport equation for the distribution function of the degree of\nmalfunctioning of neurons. The second equation contains an integral term\ndescribing the random onset of the disease as a jump process localised in\nparticularly sensitive areas of the brain. Our numerical simulations are in\ngood qualitative agreement with clinical images of the disease distribution in\nthe brain which vary from early to advanced stages.\n", "  A major puzzle about the nature of the iron-based superconductivity appears\nin the case of the alkaline iron selenides. Compared to the iron pnictides,\nthese systems have only electron Fermi pockets (i.e. no hole Fermi pockets) but\ncomparable superconducting transition temperatures. The challenge lies in\nreconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state:\na node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation\nspectrum. We propose a mechanism based on reconstructing two quasi-degenerate\npairing states, one in an $s$-wave $A_{1g}$ channel that is fully gapped, and\nthe other in a $d$-wave $B_{1g}$ channel whose pairing function changes sign\nacross the electron Fermi pockets at the Brillouin-zone boundary. The resulting\nintermediate pairing state, which we call an orbital-selective $s \\times\n\\tau_3$ state, incorporates both of the above two properties. When the leading\nspin-singlet pairing is in the $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$ orbital subspace, this state\nretains the $s$-wave form factor but has a $B_{1g}$ symmetry due to an internal\n$\\tau_3$ structure in the orbital space. Within a five-orbital $t-J_{1}-J_{2}$\nmodel with orbital-selective exchange couplings, we show that the proposed\npairing state is energetically competitive over a finite range of control\nparameters. We calculate the dynamical spin susceptibility in the\norbital-selective $s \\times \\tau_3$ superconducting state and show that a spin\nresonance arises and has the characteristics of observed by inelastic neutron\nexperiments in the alkaline iron selenides. More generally, the formation of\nthe orbital-selective $s \\times \\tau_3$ state represents a novel means of\nrelieving the quasi-degeneracy between $s-$ and $d-$wave pairing states, which\nis a hitherto unsuspected alternative to the conventional route of linearly\nsuperposing the two into a time-reversal symmetry breaking $s+id$ state.\n", "  Massive higher spin fields on de Sitter space exhibit enhanced gauge\nsymmetries at special values of the mass. These fields are known as \"partially\nmassless.\" We study the structure of the charges and Gauss laws which\ncharacterize sources for the partially massless spin-2. Despite having a simple\nscalar gauge symmetry, there is a rich structure of gauge charges. The charges\ncome in electric and magnetic varieties, each taking values in the fundamental\nrepresentation of the de Sitter group. We find two invariant electric-like\ncharges and two invariant magnetic-like charges and we find the point-like\nmonopole solutions which carry these charges, analogous to the electric point\ncharge solution and Dirac monopole solution of Maxwell electrodynamics. These\nsolutions are related by partially massless duality, analogous to the\nelectromagnetic duality that relates electric to magnetic charges.\n", "  We discuss the role of Poisson-Nijenhuis geometry in the definition of\nmultiplicative integrable models on symplectic groupoids. These are integrable\nmodels that are compatible with the groupoid structure in such a way that the\nset of contour levels of the hamiltonians in involution inherits a topological\ngroupoid structure. We show that every maximal rank PN structure defines such a\nmodel. We consider the examples defined on compact hermitian symmetric spaces\nand studied in [arXiv:1503.07339].\n", "  In the framework of Brans-Dicke cosmology, we have studied the interacting\npower-law and logarithmic entropy-corrected holographic dark energy models with\ndifferent cut-offs. The Brans-Dicke parameter is investigated versus the\nconditions for the acceleration and phantom phases to show that which entropy\ncorrected model can exhibit acceleration with or without the phantom phase at\nearly and present time universes. Moreover, the classical stability or\ninstability of the interacting power-law and logarithmic entropy-corrected\nholographic dark energy models with different cut-offs is determined at early\nand present time\n", "  We construct a directional spin wavelet framework on the sphere by\ngeneralising the scalar scale-discretised wavelet transform to signals of\narbitrary spin. The resulting framework is the only wavelet framework defined\nnatively on the sphere that is able to probe the directional intensity of spin\nsignals. Furthermore, directional spin scale-discretised wavelets support the\nexact synthesis of a signal on the sphere from its wavelet coefficients and\nsatisfy excellent localisation and uncorrelation properties. Consequently,\ndirectional spin scale-discretised wavelets are likely to be of use in a wide\nrange of applications and in particular for the analysis of the polarisation of\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB). We develop new algorithms to compute\n(scalar and spin) forward and inverse wavelet transforms exactly and\nefficiently for very large data-sets containing tens of millions of samples on\nthe sphere. By leveraging a novel sampling theorem on the rotation group\ndeveloped in a companion article, only half as many wavelet coefficients as\nalternative approaches need be computed, while still capturing the full\ninformation content of the signal under analysis. Our implementation of these\nalgorithms is made publicly available.\n", "  Graphical functions are positive functions on the punctured complex plane\n$\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{0,1\\}$ which arise in quantum field theory. We generalize\na parametric integral representation for graphical functions due to Lam, Lebrun\nand Nakanishi, which implies the real analyticity of graphical functions.\nMoreover we prove a formula that relates graphical functions of planar dual\ngraphs.\n", "  Narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) usually do not host relativistic jets\nand the detection of their $\\gamma$-ray emissions is rarely reported. Evidences\nfor strong relativistic beaming effect have been found in all $\\gamma$-ray\nNLS1s to date and hence their jets are believed to be closely aligned. In this\nwork we perform a systematic analysis of 7-year {\\it Fermi} Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) data of 18 steep radio spectrum NLS1s (S-NLS1s) and report the\n{\\it first} two detections of $\\gamma$-ray emissions in this class, increasing\nthe total number of known $\\gamma$-ray NLS1s to 9. A strong and stable\n$\\gamma$-ray signal (over 8$\\sigma$) is produced by SDSS J144318.56+472556.7,\nand a significant $\\gamma$-ray emission (4.5$\\sigma$) of SDSS\nJ130522.74+511640.2 has been detected in a monthly flare in November 2013. A\nthorough investigation of their multiwavelength properties from radio to X rays\nhas been performed, finding no significant variability. Along with their\nspectral energy distributions and the radio morphology, these facts strongly\nsuggest that these two sources harbor mis-aligned and possibly underdeveloped\nrelativistic jets, which provides valuable targets to reveal the formation and\nevolution of relativistic jets under extreme circumstances.\n", "  We study the incentives that agents have to invest in costly protection\nagainst cascading failures in networked systems. Applications include\nvaccination, computer security and airport security. Agents are connected\nthrough a network and can fail either intrinsically or as a result of the\nfailure of a subset of their neighbors. We characterize the equilibrium based\non an agent's failure probability and derive conditions under which equilibrium\nstrategies are monotone in degree (i.e. in how connected an agent is on the\nnetwork). We show that different kinds of applications (e.g. vaccination,\nmalware, airport/EU security) lead to very different equilibrium patterns of\ninvestments in protection, with important welfare and risk implications. Our\nequilibrium concept is flexible enough to allow for comparative statics in\nterms of network properties and we show that it is also robust to the\nintroduction of global externalities (e.g. price feedback, congestion).\n", "  Systems with strong spin orbit coupling support a number of new phases of\nmatter and novel phenomena. This work focuses on the interplay of spin orbit\ncoupling and interactions in yielding correlated phenomena in two dimensional\ntransition metal dichalcogenides. In particular we explore the physics of Kondo\nscreening resulting from the lack of centro-symmetry, large spin splitting and\nspin valley locking in hole doped systems. The key ingredients are i) valley\ndependent spin-momentum locking perpendicular to the two dimensional crystal;\nii) single nondegenerate Fermi surface per valley, and iii) nontrivial Berry\ncurvature associated with the low energy bands. The resulting Kondo resonance\nhas a finite triplet component and nontrivial momentum space structure which\nfacilitates new approaches to both probe and manipulate the correlated state.\nUsing a variational wave function and the numerical renormalization group\napproaches we study the nature of the Kondo resonance both in the absence and\npresence of circularly polarized light. The latter induces an imbalance in the\npopulation of the two valleys leading to novel magnetic phenomena in the\ncorrelated state.\n", "  The propagation of heavy quarks (HQs) in a medium was quite often modeled by\nthe Fokker-Plank (FP) equation. Since the transport coefficients, related to\ndrag and diffusion processes are the main ingredients in the FP equation, the\nevolution of HQs is thus effectively controlled by them. At the initial stage\nof the relativistic heavy ion collisions, asymptotic weak-coupling causes the\nfree-streaming motions of partons in the beam direction and the expansion in\ntransverse directions are almost frozen, hence an anisotropy in the momentum\nspace sets in. Since HQs are too produced in the same time therefore the study\nof the effect of momentum anisotropy on the drag and diffusion coefficients\nbecomes advertently desirable. In this article we have thus studied the drag\nand diffusion of HQs in the anisotropic medium and found that the presence of\nthe anisotropy reduces both drag and diffusion coefficients. In addition, the\nanisotropy introduces an angular dependence to both the drag and diffusion\ncoefficients, as a result both coefficients get inflated when the partons are\nmoving transverse to the direction of anisotropy than parallel to the direction\nof anisotropy.\n", "  The purpose of the present note is twofold. Firstly, we highlight the\nsimilarities between the ontologies of Kastner's possibilist transactional\ninterpretation (PTI) of quantum mechanics - an extension of Cramer's\ntransactional interpretation - and the authors' hidden-measurement\ninterpretation (HMI). Secondly, we observe that although a weighted symmetry\nbreaking (WSB) process was proposed in the PTI, to explain the actualization of\nincipient transactions, no specific mechanism was actually provided to explain\nwhy the weights of such symmetry breaking are precisely those given by the Born\nrule. In other terms, PTI, similarly to decoherence theory, doesn't explain a\nquantum measurement in a complete way, but just the transition from a pure\nstate to a fully reduced density matrix state. On the other hand, the recently\nderived extended Bloch representation (EBR) - a specific implementation the HMI\n- precisely provides such missing piece of explanation, i.e., a qualitative\ndescription of the WSB as a process of actualization of hidden\nmeasurement-interactions and, more importantly, a quantitative prediction of\nthe values of the associated weights that is compatible with the Born rule of\nprobabilistic assignment. Therefore, from the PTI viewpoint, the EBR provide\nthe missing link for a complete description of a quantum measurement. However,\nEBR is in a sense more general than PTI, as it does not rely on the specific\nnotion of transaction, and therefore remains compatible with other physical\nmechanisms that could be at the origin of the measurement-interactions.\n", "  In 1975, two experimental groups have independently observed the\n4$\\pi$-symmetry of neutrons' spin, when passing through a static magnetic\nfield, using a three-blade interferometer made from a single perfect Si-crystal\n(analogous to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer of light optics). In this\narticle, we provide a complete analysis of the experiment, both from a\ntheoretical and conceptual point of view. Firstly, we solve the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation in the weak potential approximation, to obtain the amplitude of the\nrefracted and forward refracted beams, produced by the passage of neutrons\nthrough one of the three plates of the LLL interferometer. Secondly, we analyze\ntheir passage through a static magnetic field region. This allows us to find\nexplicit expressions for the intensities of the four beams exiting the\ninterferometer, two of which will be interfering and show a typical\n4$\\pi$-symmetry, when the strength of the magnetic field is varied. In the last\npart of the article, we provide a conceptual analysis of the experiment,\nshowing a neutron's phase change, when passing through the magnetic field, is\ndue to a longitudinal Stern-Gerlach effect, and not to a Larmor precession. We\nalso emphasize that these experiments do not prove the observability of the\nsign change of the wave function, when a neutron is 2$\\pi$ rotated, but\nstrongly indicate that the latter, like any other elementary \"particle,\" would\nbe a genuinely non-spatial entity.\n", "  We introduce and study the notions of translation bounded tempered\ndistributions, and autocorrelation for a tempered distrubution. We further\nintroduce the spaces of weakly, strongly and null weakly almost periodic\ntempered distributions and show that for weakly almost periodic tempered\ndistributions the Eberlein decomposition holds. For translation bounded\nmeasures all these notions coincide with the classical ones. We show that\ntempered distributions with measure Fourier transform are weakly almost\nperiodic and that for this class, the Eberlein decomposition is exactly the\nFourier dual of the Lesbegue decomposition, with the Fourier-Bohr coefficients\nspecifying the pure point part of the Fourier transform. We complete the\nproject by looking at few interesting examples.\n", "  We give and prove an optimal exact quantum query algorithm with complexity\n$k+1$ for computing the promise problem (i.e., symmetric and partial Boolean\nfunction) $DJ_n^k$ defined as: $DJ_n^k(x)=1$ for $|x|=n/2$, $DJ_n^k(x)=0$ for\n$|x|$ in the set $\\{0, 1,\\ldots, k, n-k, n-k+1,\\ldots,n\\}$, and it is undefined\nfor the rest cases, where $n$ is even, $|x|$ is the Hamming weight of $x$. The\ncase of $k=0$ is the well-known Deutsch-Jozsa problem. We outline all symmetric\n(and partial) Boolean functions with degrees 1 and 2, and prove their exact\nquantum query complexity. Then we prove that any symmetrical (and partial)\nBoolean function $f$ has exact quantum 1-query complexity if and only if $f$\ncan be computed by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. We also discover the optimal\nexact quantum 2-query complexity for distinguishing between inputs of Hamming\nweight $\\{ \\lfloor n/2\\rfloor, \\lceil n/2\\rceil \\}$ and Hamming weight in the\nset $\\{ 0, n\\}$ for all odd $n$. In addition, a method is provided to determine\nthe degree of any symmetrical (and partial) Boolean function.\n", "  Breaking of equivalence between the microcanonical ensemble and the canonical\nensemble, describing a large system subject to hard and soft constraints,\nrespectively, was recently shown to occur in large random graphs. Hard\nconstraints must be met by every graph, soft constraints must be met only on\naverage, subject to maximal entropy. In Squartini et al. (2015) it was shown\nthat ensembles of random graphs are non-equivalent when the degrees of the\nnodes are constrained, in the sense of a non-zero limiting specific relative\nentropy as the number of nodes diverges. In that paper, the nodes were placed\neither on a single layer (uni-partite graphs) or on two layers (bi-partite\ngraphs). In the present paper we consider an arbitrary number of\nintra-connected and inter-connected layers, thus allowing for modular graphs\nwith a multi-partite, multiplex, block-model or community structure. We give a\nfull classification of ensemble equivalence, proving that breakdown occurs if\nand only if the number of local constraints (i.e., the number of constrained\ndegrees) is extensive in the number of nodes, irrespective of the layer\nstructure. In addition, we derive a formula for the specific relative entropy\nand provide an interpretation of this formula in terms of Poissonisation of the\ndegrees.\n", "  In this work, phase diagrams of a modified two-mode phase-field crystal (PFC)\nthat show two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) crystallographic\nstructures were determined by utilizing a free energy minimization method. In\nthis study the modified two-mode PFC model (presented by E. Asadi and M. Asle\nZaeem, Comput. Mater. Sci. 2015) was used, in which the free energy can be\nexactly minimized in each stable crystal structure allowing calculation of\naccurate phase diagrams for two-mode PFC models. Different crystal structures,\nsuch as square, triangle, body-centered cubic (bcc), face-centered cubic (fcc),\nand stripe lattice structures as well as their coexistence regions were\nconsidered in the calculations. The model parameters were discussed to\ncalculate phase diagrams that can be used as a guideline by other researchers\nfor studying solidification and solid state phase transformation using two-mode\nPFC model.\n", "  Supernova remnants (SNRs) have commonly been considered as a source of the\nobserved PeV cosmic rays (CRs) or a Galactic PeV particle accelerator\n(\"Pevatron\"). In this work, we study Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which is the\nlow-luminosity active galactic nucleus of the Milky Way Galaxy, as another\npossible canditate of the Pevatron, because it sometimes became very active in\nthe past. We assume that a large number of PeV CRs were injected by Sgr A* at\nthe outburst about 10^7 yr ago when the Fermi bubbles were created. We\nconstrain the diffusion coefficient for the CRs in the Galactic halo on the\ncondition that the CRs have arrived on the Earth by now, while a fairly large\nfraction of them have escaped from the halo. Based on a diffusion-halo model,\nwe solve a diffusion equation for the CRs and compare the results with the CR\nspectrum on the Earth. The observed small anisotropy of the arrival directions\nof CRs may be explained if the diffusion coefficient in the Galactic disk is\nsmaller than that in the halo. Our model predicts that a boron-to-carbon ratio\nshould be energy-independent around the knee, where the CRs from Sgr A* become\ndominant. It is unlikely that the spectrum of the CRs accelerated at the\noutburst is represented by a power-law similar to the one for those responsible\nfor the gamma-ray emission from the central molecular zone (CMZ) around the\nGalactic center.\n", "  We present a framework for studying bosonic non-Gaussian channels of\ncontinuous-variable systems. Our emphasis is on a class of channels that we\ncall photon-added Gaussian channels, which are experimentally viable with\ncurrent quantum-optical technologies. A strong motivation for considering these\nchannels is the fact that it is compulsory to go beyond the Gaussian domain for\nnumerous tasks in continuous-variable quantum information processing such as\nentanglement distillation from Gaussian states and universal quantum\ncomputation. The single-mode photon-added channels we consider are obtained by\nusing two-mode beam splitters and squeezing operators with photon addition\napplied to the ancilla ports giving rise to families of non-Gaussian channels.\nFor each such channel, we derive its operator-sum representation, indispensable\nin the present context. We observe that these channels are Fock preserving\n(coherence nongenerating). We then report two examples of activation using our\nscheme of photon addition, that of quantum-optical nonclassicality at outputs\nof channels that would otherwise output only classical states and of both the\nquantum and private communication capacities, hinting at far-reaching\napplications for quantum-optical communication. Further, we see that noisy\nGaussian channels can be expressed as a convex mixture of these non-Gaussian\nchannels. We also present other physical and information-theoretic properties\nof these channels.\n", "  We consider accretion onto a Kiselev black hole. We obtain the fundamental\nequations for accretion without the back-reaction. We determine the general\nanalytic expressions for the critical points and the mass accretion rate and\nfind the physical conditions the critical points should fulfill. The case of\npolytropic gas are discussed in detail. It turns out that the quintessence\nparameter plays an important role in the accretion process.\n", "  Despite the long history of dislocation-phonon interaction studies, there are\nmany problems that have not been fully resolved during this development. These\ninclude an incompatibility between a perturbative approach and the long-range\nnature of a dislocation, the relation between static and dynamic scattering,\nand the nature of dislocation-phonon resonance. Here by introducing a fully\nquantized dislocation field, the \"dislon\"[1], a phonon is renormalized as a\nquasi-phonon, with shifted quasi-phonon energy, and accompanied by a finite\nquasi-phonon lifetime that is reducible to classical results. A series of\noutstanding legacy issues including those above can be directly explained\nwithin this unified phonon renormalization approach. In particular, a\nrenormalized phonon naturally resolves the decades-long debate between dynamic\nand static dislocation-phonon scattering approaches.\n", "  We obtain the Buchdahl compactness limit for a pure Lovelock static fluid\nstar and verify that the limit following from the uniform density\nSchwarzschild's interior solution, which is universal irrespective of the\ngravitational theory (Einstein or Lovelock), is true in general. In terms of\nsurface potential $\\Phi(r)$, it means at the surface of the star $r=r_{0}$,\n$\\Phi(r_{0}) < 2N(d-N-1)/(d-1)^2$ where $d$, $N$ respectively indicate\nspacetime dimensions and Lovelock order. For a given $N$, $\\Phi(r_{0})$ is\nmaximum for $d=2N+2$ while it is always $4/9$, Buchdahl's limit, for $d=3N+1$.\nIt is also remarkable that for $N=1$ Einstein gravity, or for pure Lovelock in\n$d=3N+1$, Buchdahl's limit is equivalent to the criteria that gravitational\nfield energy exterior to the star is less than half its gravitational mass,\nhaving no reference to the interior at all.\n", "  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are promising as sources of neutrinos and cosmic\nrays. In the internal shock scenario, blobs of plasma emitted from a central\nengine collide within a relativistic jet and form shocks, leading to particle\nacceleration and emission. Motivated by present experimental constraints and\nsensitivities, we improve the predictions of particle emission by investigating\ntime-dependent effects from multiple shocks. We produce synthetic light curves\nwith different variability timescales that stem from properties of the central\nengine. For individual GRBs, qualitative conclusions about model parameters,\nneutrino production efficiency, and delays in high-energy gamma rays can be\ndeduced from inspection of the gamma-ray light curves. GRBs with fast time\nvariability without additional prominent pulse structure tend to be efficient\nneutrino emitters, whereas GRBs with fast variability modulated by a broad\npulse structure can be inefficient neutrino emitters and produce delayed\nhigh-energy gamma-ray signals. Our results can be applied to quantitative tests\nof the GRB origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, and have the potential to\nimpact current and future multi-messenger searches.\n", "  At least a fraction of Gravitational Wave (GW) progenitors are expected to\nemit an electromagnetic (EM) signal in the form of a short gamma-ray burst\n(sGRB). Discovering such a transient EM counterpart is challenging because the\n\\LIGO/\\VIRGO localization region is much larger (several hundreds of square\ndegrees) than the field of view of X-ray, optical and radio telescopes. The\nFermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has a wide field of view ($\\sim 2.4$ sr), and\ndetects $\\sim 2-3$ sGRBs per year above 100 MeV. It can detect them not only\nduring the short prompt phase, but also during their long-lasting high-energy\nafterglow phase. If other wide-field high-energy instruments such as Fermi-GBM,\nSwift-BAT or INTEGRAL-ISGRI cannot detect or localize with enough precision an\nEM counterpart during the prompt phase, the LAT can potentially pinpoint it\nwith $\\lesssim 10$ arcmin accuracy during the afterglow phase. This routinely\nhappens with gamma-ray bursts. Moreover, the LAT will cover the entire\nlocalization region within hours of any triggers during normal operations,\nallowing the $\\gamma$-ray flux of any EM counterpart to be measured or\nconstrained. We illustrate two new ad hoc methods to search for EM counterparts\nwith the LAT and their application to the GW candidate LVT151012.\n", "  We present a construction of isotropic boundary adapted wavelets, which are\northogonal and yield a multi-resolution analysis. We analyze direct numerical\nsimulation data of turbulent channel flow computed at a friction Reynolds\nnumber of 395, and investigate the role of coherent vorticity. Thresholding of\nthe vorticity wavelet coefficients allows to split the flow into two parts,\ncoherent and incoherent vorticity. The coherent vorticity is reconstructed from\ntheir few intense wavelet coefficients. The statistics of the coherent part,\ni.e., energy and enstrophy spectra, are close to the statistics of the total\nflow, and moreover, the nonlinear energy budgets are very well preserved. The\nremaining incoherent part, represented by the large majority of the weak\nwavelet coefficients, corresponds to a structureless, i.e., noise-like,\nbackground flow whose energy is equidistributed.\n", "  The model of Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to the scalar field for finite\ntime is studied. A systematic way of computing finite time corrections in\nvarious cases is suggested and nonperturbative effects like thermalization are\ndiscussed. It is shown in particular that adiabatic switching off the coupling\nbetween the detector and the thermal bath leaves non-vanishing corrections to\nthe detector's levels distribution. Considering the two level detector as an\ninformation bearing degree of freedom encoding one bit of information, limits\non external work for the detector's (de)couling in finite time following from\nthe Landauer's bound are formulated.\n", "  A theoretical framework is developed for understanding the transient growth\nand propagation characteristics of thermodynamically coupled, meridional\nmode-like structures in the tropics. The model consists of a Gill-Matsuno type\nsteady atmosphere under the longwave approximation coupled via a\nwind-evaporation-sea surface temperature (WES) feedback to a \"slab\" ocean\nmodel. When projected onto basis functions for the atmosphere the system\nsimplifies to a non-normal set of equations that describes the evolution of\nindividual sea surface temperature (SST) modes, with clean separation between\nsymmetric and anti-symmetric modes. The following major findings result from\nanalysis of the system: (i) a transient growth process exists whereby specific\nSST modes propagate toward lower order modes at the expense of the higher-order\nmodes; (ii) the same dynamical mechanisms govern the evolution of symmetric and\nanti-symmetric SST modes except for the lowest-order wave number, where for\nsymmetric structures the atmospheric Kelvin wave plays a critically different\nrole in enhancing decay; and (iii) the WES feedback is positive for all modes\n(with a maximum for the most equatorially confined antisymmetric structure)\nexcept for the most equatorially confined symmetric mode where the Kelvin wave\ngenerates a negative WES feedback. Taken together, these findings explain why\nequatorially anti-symmetric \"dipole\"-like structures may dominate\nthermodynamically coupled ocean / atmosphere variability in the tropics. The\nrole of non-normality as well as the role of realistic mean states in\nmeridional mode variability are discussed.\n", "  We prove that the Kontsevich tetrahedral flow $\\dot{\\mathcal{P}} =\n\\mathcal{Q}_{a:b} (\\mathcal{P})$, the right-hand side of which is a linear\ncombination of two differential monomials of degree four in a bi-vector\n$\\mathcal{P}$ on an affine real Poisson manifold $N^n$, does infinitesimally\npreserve the space of Poisson bi-vectors on $N^n$ if and only if the two\nmonomials in $\\mathcal{Q}_{a:b} (\\mathcal{P})$ are balanced by the ratio\n$a:b=1:6$. The proof is explicit; it is written in the language of Kontsevich\ngraphs.\n", "  We present a general scheme to map correlated nonequilibrium quantum impurity\nproblems onto an auxiliary open quantum system of small size. The infinite\nfermionic reservoirs of the original system are thereby replaced by a small\nnumber $N_B$ of noninteracting auxiliary bath sites whose dynamics is described\nby a Lindblad equation. Due to the presence of the intermediate bath sites, the\noverall dynamics acting on the impurity site is non-Markovian.\n  With the help of an optimization scheme for the auxiliary Lindblad\nparameters, an accurate mapping is achieved, which becomes exponentially exact\nupon increasing $N_B$. The basic idea for this scheme was presented previously\nin the context of nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory. In successive\nworks on improved manybody solution strategies for the auxiliary Lindblad\nequation, such as Lanczos exact diagonalization or matrix product states, we\napplied the approach to study the nonequilibrium Kondo regime.\n  In the present paper, we address in detail the mapping procedure itself,\nrather than the many-body solution. In particular, we investigate the effects\nof the geometry of the auxiliary system on the accuracy of the mapping for\ngiven $N_B$. Specifically, we present a detailed convergence study for five\ndifferent geometries which, besides being of practical utility, reveals\nimportant insights into the underlying mechanisms of the mapping. For setups\nwith onsite or nearest-neighbor Lindblad parameters we find that a\nrepresentation adopting two separate bath chains is by far more accurate with\nrespect to other choices based on a single chain or a commonly used star\ngeometry. A significant improvement is obtained by allowing for long-ranged and\ncomplex Lindblad parameters. These results can be of great value when studying\nLindblad-type approaches to correlated systems.\n", "  We introduce a dual wave-particle macroscopic system, where a bead oscillator\noscillates in an elastic medium which obeys the Klein-Gordon equation. This\ntheoretical system is mostly inspired by bouncing droplets experiments and bead\nsliding on a vibrating string experiments. This system is studied using a\ncommon and simple mathematical formalism. We compute the motion equation of the\nbead as well as the wave equation of the system. We introduce the effective\nvelocity of the bead with respect to the elastic medium and the wave $\\psi$,\ncreated by the bead, which modulates the natural wave of the medium. Provided\nsome conditions, $\\psi$ obeys an equation analogous to the free Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. In the case of linear and spherical cavities, the particle-like\ncharacteristics of the bead, expressed with its effective velocity, are\nproportional to the corresponding wave-like characteristics of the system.\n  This paper is a translation of Dualit\\'e onde-corpuscule form\\'ee par une\nmasselotte oscillante dans un milieu \\'elastique : \\'etude th\\'eorique et\nsimilitudes quantiques.\n", "  Fuzzy spaces like the fuzzy sphere or the fuzzy torus have received\nremarkable attention, since they appeared as objects in string theory. Although\nthere are many higher dimensional examples, the most known and most studied\nfuzzy spaces are realized as matrix algebras defined by three Hermitian\nmatrices, which may be seen as fuzzy membranes or fuzzy surfaces. We give a\nmapping between directed graphs and matrix algebras defined by three Hermitian\nmatrices and show that the matrix algebras of known two-dimensional fuzzy\nspaces are associated with unbranched graphs. By including branchings into the\ngraphs we find matrix algebras that represent fuzzy spaces associated with\nsurfaces having genus 2 and higher.\n", "  In this paper, we study the possibility of an inhomogeneous quark condensate\nin the 1+1 dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in the large-$N_c$ limit at\nfinite temperature $T$ and quark chemical potential $\\mu$ using dimensional\nregularization. The phase diagram in the $\\mu$--$T$ plane is mapped out. At\nzero temperature, an inhomogeneous phase with a chiral-density wave exists for\nall values of $\\mu>\\mu_c$. Performing a Ginzburg-Landau analysis, we show that\nin the chiral limit, the critical point and the Lifschitz point coincide. We\nalso consider the competition between a chiral-density wave and a constant pion\ncondensate at finite isospin chemical potential $\\mu_I$. The phase diagram in\nthe $\\mu_I$--$\\mu$ plane is mapped out and shows a rich phase structure.\n", "  The proton-proton momentum correlation functions ($C_{pp}(q)$) for\nkinematically complete decay channels of $^{23}$Al $\\rightarrow$ p + p +\n$^{21}$Na and $^{22}$Mg $\\rightarrow$ p + p + $^{20}$Ne have been measured at\nthe RIKEN RI Beam Factory. From the very different correlation strength of\n$C_{pp}(q)$ for $^{23}$Al and $^{22}$Mg, the source size and emission time\ninformation were extracted from the $C_{pp}(q)$ data by assuming a Gaussian\nsource profile in the correlation function calculation code (CRAB). The results\nindicated that the mechanism of two-proton emission from $^{23}$Al was mainly\nsequential emission, while that of $^{22}$Mg was mainly three-body simultaneous\nemission. By combining our earlier results of the two-proton relative momentum\nand the opening angle, it is pointed out that the mechanism of two-proton\nemission could be distinguished clearly.\n", "  Initial partonic eccentricities in Au+Au collisions at center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV are investigated using a multi-phase transport model\nwith string melting scenario. The initial eccentricities in different order of\nharmonics are studied using participant and cumulant definitions. Eccentricity\nin terms of second-, fourth- and sixth order cumulants as a function of number\nof participant nucleons are compared systematically with the traditional\nparticipant definition. The ratio of the cumulant eccentricities\n$\\varepsilon\\left\\{4\\right\\}/\\varepsilon\\left\\{2\\right\\}$ and\n$\\varepsilon\\left\\{6\\right\\}/\\varepsilon\\left\\{4\\right\\}$ are studied in\ncomparison with the ratio of the corresponding flow harmonics. The conversion\ncoefficients ($v_n/\\varepsilon_n$) are explored up to fourth order harmonic\nbased on cumulant method. Furthermore, studies on transverse momentum ($p_T$)\nand pseudo-rapidity ($\\eta$) dependencies of eccentricities and their\nfluctuations are presented. As in ideal hydrodynamics initial eccentricities\nare expected to be closely related to the final flow harmonics in relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions, studies of the fluctuating initial condition in the AMPT\nmodel will shed light on the tomography properties of the initial source\ngeometry.\n", "  Thermalization process of nuclear matter in central fireball region of\nheavy-ion collisions is investigated by employing an extension model of\nBoltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck, namely the Van der Waals\nBoltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (VdWBUU) model. Temperature ($T$) is extracted by\nthe quantum Fermion fluctuation approach and other thermodynamic quantities,\nsuch as density ($\\rho$), entropy density ($s$), shear viscosity ($\\eta$),\nisospin diffusivity ($D_{I}$) and heat conductivity ($\\kappa$), are also\ndeduced. The liquid-like and gas-like phase signs are discussed through the\nbehavior of shear viscosity during heavy-ion collisions process with the VdWBUU\nmodel.\n", "  A large class of the recently found unimodular nonabelian homogeneous\nYang-Baxter deformations of the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring can be realized as\nsequences of noncommuting TsT transformations. I show that many of them are\nduals to various noncommutative versions of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory,\nstructurally determined directly in terms of the associated r matrices, in line\nwith previous expectations in the literature.\n", "  We use three IR cutoffs, including the future event horizon, the Hubble and\nGranda-Oliveros (GO) cutoffs, to construct three holographic models of dark\nenergy. Additionally, we consider a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe\nfilled by a dark matter (DM) and a dark energy that interact with each other\nthrough a mutual sign-changeable interaction. Thereinafter, we address the\nevolution of the some cosmological parameters, such as the equation of state\nand dimensionless density parameters of dark energy as well as the deceleration\nparameter, during the cosmic evolution from the matter dominated era until the\nlate time acceleration. We observe that a holographic dark energy (HDE) model\nwith Hubble cutoff interacting with DM may be in line with the current\nuniverse. Our study shows that models with the future event horizon as the IR\ncutoff or the GO cutoff are in good agreement with the observational data. In\nfact, we find out that these obtained models can predict the universe\ntransition from a deceleration phase to the acceleration one in a compatible\nway with observations. The three obtained models may also allow the equation of\nstate parameter to cross the phantom line, a result which depends on the values\nof the system's constants such as the value of the interaction coupling\nconstant.\n", "  We investigate the critical behavior of an $(n+1)$-dimensional topological\ndilaton black holes, in an extended phase space in both canonical and\ngrand-canonical ensembles, when the gauge field is in the form of power-Maxwell\nfield. In order to do this we introduce for the first time the counterterms\nthat remove the divergences of the action in dilaton gravity for the solutions\nwith curved boundary. Using the counterterm method, we calculate the conserved\nquantities and the action and therefore Gibbs free energy in both the canonical\nand grand-canonical ensembles. We treat the cosmological constant as a\nthermodynamic pressure, and its conjugate quantity as a thermodynamic volume.\nIn the presence of power-Maxwell field, we find an analogy between the\ntopological dilaton black holes with van der Walls liquid-gas system in all\ndimensions provided the dilaton coupling constant $\\alpha$ and the power\nparameter $p$ are chosen properly. Interestingly enough, we observe that the\npower-Maxwell dilaton black holes admit the phase transition in both canonical\nand grand-canonical ensembles. This is in contrast to RN-AdS,\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton and Born-Infeld-dilaton black holes, which only admit\nthe phase transition in the canonical ensemble. Besides, we calculate the\ncritical quantities and show that they depend on $\\alpha$, $n$ and $p$.\nFinally, we obtain the critical exponents in two ensembles and show that they\nare independent of the model parameters and have the same values as mean field\ntheory.\n", "  Future electroweak precision measurements in the Circular Electron Positron\nCollider (CEPC) project would significantly improve the precision of\nelectroweak oblique parameters. We evaluate the expected precision through\nglobal fits, and study the corresponding sensitivity to weakly interacting\nfermionic dark matter. Three models with electroweak multiplets in the dark\nsector are investigated as illuminating examples. We find that the CEPC data\ncan probe up to TeV scales and explore some regions where direct detection\ncannot reach, especially when the models respect the custodial symmetry.\n", "  A scheme for active temporal-to-spatial demultiplexing of single-photons\ngenerated by a solid-state source is introduced. The scheme scales\nquasi-polynomially with photon number, providing a viable technological path\nfor routing n photons in the one temporal stream from a single emitter to n\ndifferent spatial modes. The active demultiplexing is demonstrated using a\nstate-of-the-art photon source---a quantum-dot deterministically coupled to a\nmicropillar cavity---and a custom-built demultiplexer---a network of\nelectro-optically reconfigurable waveguides monolithically integrated in a\nlithium niobate chip. The measured demultiplexer performance can enable a\nsix-photon rate three orders of magnitude higher than the equivalent heralded\nSPDC source, providing a platform for intermediate quantum computation\nprotocols.\n", "  We use the dynamical analysis to study the evolution of the universe at late\ntime for the model in which the interaction between dark energy and dark matter\nis inspired by disformal transformation. We extend the analysis in the existing\nliterature by supposing that the disformal coefficient depends both on the\nscalar field and its kinetic terms. We find that the dependence of the\ndisformal coefficient on the kinetic term of scalar field leads to two classes\nof the scaling fixed points that can describe the acceleration of the universe\nat late time. The first class exists only for the case where the disformal\ncoefficient depends on the kinetic terms. The fixed points in this class are\nsaddle points unless the slope of the conformal coefficient is sufficiently\nlarge. The second class can be viewed as the generalization of the fixed points\nstudied in the literature. According to the stability analysis of these fixed\npoints, we find that the stable fixed point can take two different physically\nrelevant values for the same value of the parameters of the model. These\ndifferent values of the fixed points can be reached for different initial\nconditions for the equation of state parameter of dark energy. We also discuss\nthe situations in which this feature disappears.\n", "  The ability of a honeybee swarm to select the best nest site plays a\nfundamental role in determining the future colony's fitness. To date, the\nnest-site selection process has mostly been modelled and theoretically analysed\nfor the case of binary decisions. However, when the number of alternative nests\nis larger than two, the decision process dynamics qualitatively change. In this\nwork, we extend previous analyses of a value-sensitive decision-making\nmechanism to a decision process among N nests. First, we present the\ndecision-making dynamics in the symmetric case of N equal-quality nests. Then,\nwe generalise our findings to a best-of-N decision scenario with one superior\nnest and N-1 inferior nests, previously studied empirically in bees and ants.\nWhereas previous binary models highlighted the crucial role of inhibitory\nstop-signalling, the key parameter in our new analysis is the relative time\ninvested by swarm members in individual discovery and in signalling behaviours.\nOur new analysis reveals conflicting pressures on this ratio in symmetric and\nbest-of-N decisions, which could be solved through a time-dependent signalling\nstrategy. Additionally, our analysis suggests how ecological factors\ndetermining the density of suitable nest sites may have led to selective\npressures for an optimal stable signalling ratio.\n", "  We introduce and analyze a dispersive qubit readout scheme where two-mode\nsqueezing is generated directly in the measurement cavities. The resulting\nsuppression of noise enables fast, high- fidelity readout of naturally weakly\ncoupled qubits, and the possibility to protect strongly coupled qubits from\ndecoherence by weakening their coupling. Unlike other approaches exploiting\nsqueezing, our setup avoids the difficult task of transporting and injecting\nwith high fidelity an externally-generated squeezed state. Our setup is also\nsurprisingly robust against unwanted non-QND backaction effects, as\ninterference naturally suppresses Purcell decay: the system acts as its own\nPurcell filter. Our setup is compatible with the experimental state-of-the-art\nin circuit QED systems, but the basic idea could also be realized in other\nsystems.\n", "  We present ultraviolet, optical and infrared photometry and optical\nspectroscopy of the type Ic superluminous supernova (SLSN) Gaia16apd (= SN\n2016eay), covering its evolution from 26 d before the $g$-band peak to 234.1 d\nafter the peak. Gaia16apd was followed as a part of the NOT Unbiased Transient\nSurvey (NUTS). It is one of the closest SLSNe known ($z = 0.102\\pm0.001$), with\ndetailed optical and ultraviolet (UV) observations covering the peak. Gaia16apd\nis a spectroscopically typical type Ic SLSN, exhibiting the characteristic blue\nearly spectra with O II absorption, and reaches a peak $M_{g} = -21.8 \\pm 0.1$\nmag. However, photometrically it exhibits an evolution intermediate between the\nfast- and slowly-declining type Ic SLSNe, with an early evolution closer to the\nfast-declining events. Together with LSQ12dlf, another SLSN with similar\nproperties, it demonstrates a possible continuum between fast- and\nslowly-declining events. It is unusually UV-bright even for a SLSN, reaching a\nnon-$K$-corrected $M_{uvm2} \\simeq -23.3$ mag, the only other type Ic SLSN with\nsimilar UV brightness being SN 2010gx. Assuming that Gaia16apd was powered by\nmagnetar spin-down, we derive a period of $P = 1.9\\pm0.2$ ms and a magnetic\nfield of $B = 1.9\\pm0.2 \\times 10^{14}$ G for the magnetar. The estimated\nejecta mass is between 8 and 16 $\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and the kinetic energy\nbetween 1.3 and $2.5 \\times 10^{52}$ erg, depending on opacity and assuming\nthat the entire ejecta is swept up into a thin shell. Despite the early\nphotometric differences, the spectra at late times are similar to\nslowly-declining type Ic SLSNe, implying that the two subclasses originate from\nsimilar progenitors.\n", "  With recent developments in high-precision quantum measurements, the question\nof whether observations of decoherence from spacetime fluctuations are\naccessible experimentally arises. Here we investigate the dynamics of bound\nstates interacting with an environment of gravitons under the Markov\napproximation. The corresponding Lindblad master equation is presented that\nenables gravitational decoherence and dissipation due to zero-point spacetime\nfluctuations to be analyzed. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional cavity\nof massless scalar particles that models a light beam with negligible spin\npolarizations being reflected between two free masses. Numerical simulations\nhave been performed to illustrate the wave-modal dependent decoherence and\ndissipation of such a configuration. We further demonstrate the existence of\nnontrivial collective effects akin to superradiance, providing amplifications\nof gravitational decoherence for a large number of identical bosonic particles.\n", "  Out-of-time ordered (OTO) correlation functions describe scrambling of\ninformation in correlated quantum matter. They are of particular interest in\nincoherent quantum systems lacking well defined quasi-particles. Thus far, it\nis largely elusive how OTO correlators spread in incoherent systems with\ndiffusive transport governed by a few globally conserved quantities. Here, we\nstudy the dynamical response of such a system using high-performance\nmatrix-product-operator techniques. Specifically, we consider the\nnon-integrable, one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the incoherent\nhigh-temperature regime. Our system exhibits diffusive dynamics in time-ordered\ncorrelators of globally conserved quantities, whereas OTO correlators display a\nballistic, light-cone spreading of quantum information. The slowest process in\nthe global thermalization of the system is thus diffusive, yet information\nspreading is not inhibited by such slow dynamics. We furthermore develop an\nexperimentally feasible protocol to overcome some challenges faced by existing\nproposals and to probe time-ordered and OTO correlation functions. Our study\nopens new avenues for both the theoretical and experimental exploration of\nthermalization and information scrambling dynamics.\n", "  The collective spin-wave excitations in the antiferromagnetic state of\n$\\gamma$-Fe$_{0.7}$Mn$_{0.3}$ were investigated using the inelastic neutron\nscattering technique. The spin excitations remain isotropic up to the high\nexcitation energy, ${\\hbar\\omega}= 78$ meV. The excitations gradually become\nbroad and damped above 40 meV. The damping parameter ${\\gamma}$ reaches 110(16)\nmeV at ${\\hbar\\omega} = 78$ meV, which is much larger than that for other\nmetallic compounds, e.g., CaFe$_2$As$_2$ (24 meV),\nLa$_{2-2x}$Sr$_{1+2x}$Mn$_2$O$_7$ ($52-72$ meV), and Mn$_{90}$Cu$_{10}$ (88\nmeV). In addition, the spin-wave dispersion shows a deviation from the relation\n$({\\hbar\\omega})^2 = c^2q^2 + {\\Delta}^2$ above 40 meV. The group velocity\nabove this energy increases to 470(40) meV{\\AA}, which is higher than that at\nthe low energies, $c = 226(5)$ meV{\\AA}. These results could suggest that the\nspin-wave excitations merge with the continuum of the individual particle-hole\nexcitations at 40 meV.\n", "  We reconsider the holographic dark energy (HDE) model with a slowly time\nvarying $ c^2(z)$ parameter in the energy density, namely $\\rho_D=3M_p^2\nc^2(z)/L^2$, where $L$ is the IR cutoff and $z$ is the redshift parameter. As\nthe system's IR cutoff we choose the Hubble radius and the Granda-Oliveros (GO)\ncutoffs. The latter inspired by the Ricci scalar curvature. We derive the\nevolution of the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state and the\ndeceleration parameters as the explicit functions of the redshift parameter\n$z$. Then, we plot the evolutions of these cosmological parameters in terms of\nthe redshift parameter during the history of the universe. Interestingly\nenough, we observe that by choosing $L=H^{-1}$ as the IR cutoff for the HDE\nwith time varying $ c ^2(z) $ term, the present acceleration of the universe\nexpansion can be achieved, even in the absence of interaction between dark\nenergy and dark matter. This is in contrast to the usual HDE model with\nconstant $c^2$ term, which leads to a wrong equation of state, namely that for\ndust $w_D=0$, when the IR cutoff is chosen the Hubble radius.\n", "  The inter-glitch timing of the Vela pulsar is characterized by a constant\nsecond derivative of the rotation rate. This takes over after the post-glitch\nexponential relaxation, and is completed at about the time of the next glitch.\nThe vortex creep model explains the second derivatives in terms of non-linear\nresponse to the glitch. We present inter-glitch timing fits to the present\nsample covering 16 large glitches, taking into account the possibility that in\nsome glitches part of the step in spin-down rate may involve a \"persistent\nshift\", as observed in the Crab pulsar. Modifying the expression for the time\nbetween glitches with this hypothesis leads to better agreement with the\nobserved inter-glitch time intervals. We extrapolate the inter-glitch model\nfits to obtain spin-down rates just prior to each glitch, and use these to\ncalculate the braking index n = 2.81 +/- 0.12. The next glitch should occur\naround Dec. 22, 2017 +/- 197 days if no persistent shift is involved, but could\noccur as early as July 27, 2016 +/- 152 days if the 2013 glitch gave rise to a\ntypical Vela persistent shift. Note added: Literally while we were submitting\nthe first version of this paper, on Dec. 12, 2016, we saw ATel # 9847\nannouncing a Vela pulsar glitch which has arrived 138 days after our prediction\nwith a persistent shift, within the 1 sigma uncertainty of 152 days.\n", "  A directional random laser mediated by transverse Anderson localization in a\ndisordered glass optical fiber is reported. Previous demonstrations of random\nlasers have found limited applications because of their multi-directionality\nand chaotic fluctuations in the laser emission. The random laser presented in\nthis paper operates in the Anderson localization regime. The disorder induced\nlocalized states form isolated local channels that make the output laser beam\nhighly directional and stabilize its spectrum. The strong transverse disorder\nand longitudinal invariance result in isolated lasing modes with negligible\ninteraction with their surroundings, traveling back and forth in a Fabry-Perot\ncavity formed by the air-fiber interfaces. It is shown that if a localized\ninput pump is scanned across the disordered fiber input facet, the output laser\nsignal follows the transverse position of the pump. Moreover, a uniformly\ndistributed pump across the input facet of the disordered fiber generates a\nlaser signal with very low spatial coherence that can be of practical\nimportance in many optical platforms including image transport with fiber\nbundles.\n", "  Pattern of confined chemical garden was controlled by the speed of injected\nfluid, and their mechanism is discussed. A confined chemical garden system was\nconstructed where an aqueous solution of cobalt chloride was injected into a\ncell filled with sodium silicate solution. The reaction of these two solutions\nresulted in the formation of precipitation. The viscosities of the prepared\naqueous solutions were set to be similar in order to rule out the possibility\nof Saffman-Taylor instability. The injection front showed three distinctive\npatterns: algaes, shells, and filaments, which were dependent on injection\nspeed. The injection pressure and the spatio-temporal pattern of the injected\nfluid were measured, and a significant increase in the injection pressure was\nobserved when the filament pattern appeared, which indicated the existence of\nthin lubrication layer between the precipitation and the substrate. The\nfilament pattern was further analyzed quantitatively, and the number of active\nfilaments was determined to be proportional to the injection speed. A\nmathematical model was constructed that considered both the viscous effect from\nthe thin luburiation layer and the Laplace pressure. This model successfully\nreproduced the characteristic filament dynamics.\n", "  The combination of interactions and static gauge fields plays a pivotal role\nin our understanding of strongly-correlated quantum matter. Cold atomic gases\nendowed with a synthetic dimension are emerging as an ideal platform to\nexperimentally address this interplay in quasi-one-dimensional systems. A\nfundamental question is whether these setups can give access to pristine\ntwo-dimensional phenomena, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, and how.\nWe show that unambiguous signatures of bosonic and fermionic Laughlin-like\nstates can be observed and characterized in synthetic ladders. We theoretically\ndiagnose these Laughlin-like states focusing on the chiral current flowing in\nthe ladder, on the central charge of the low-energy theory, and on the\nproperties of the entanglement entropy. Remarkably, Laughlin-like states are\nseparated from conventional liquids by Lifschitz-type transitions,\ncharacterized by sharp discontinuities in the current profiles, which we\naddress using extensive simulations based on matrix-product states. Our work\nprovides a qualitative and quantitative guideline towards the observability and\nunderstanding of strongly-correlated states of matter in synthetic ladders. In\nparticular, we unveil how state-of-the-art experimental settings constitute an\nideal starting point to progressively tackle two-dimensional strongly\ninteracting systems from a ladder viewpoint, opening a new perspective for the\nobservation of non-Abelian states of matter.\n", "  In conventional metals, modification of electron trajectories under magnetic\nfield gives rise to a magnetoresistance that varies quadratically at low field,\nfollowed by a saturation at high field for closed orbits on the Fermi surface.\nDeviations from the conventional behaviour, e.g. the observation of a linear\nmagnetoresistance, or a non-saturating magnetoresistance, have been attributed\nto exotic electron scattering mechanisms. Recently, linear magnetoresistance\nhas been observed in many Dirac materials, in which the electron-electron\ncorrelation is relatively weak. The strongly correlated helimagnet CrAs\nundergoes a quantum phase transition to a nonmagnetic superconductor under\npressure. Near the magnetic instability, we observe a large and non-saturating\nquasilinear magnetoresistance from the upper critical field to 14 T at low\ntemperatures. We show that the quasilinear magnetoresistance arises from an\nintricate interplay between a nontrivial band crossing protected by\nnonsymmorphic crystal symmetry and strong magnetic fluctuations\n", "  In this paper we study a classical and theoretical system which consists of\nan elastic medium carrying transverse waves and one point-like high elastic\nmedium density, called concretion. We compute the equation of motion for the\nconcretion as well as the wave equation of this system. Afterwards we always\nconsider the case where the concretion is not the wave source any longer. Then\nthe concretion obeys a general and covariant guidance formula, which leads in\nlow-velocity approximation to an equivalent de Broglie-Bohm guidance formula.\nThe concretion moves then as if exists an equivalent quantum potential. A\nstrictly equivalent free Schr\\\"odinger equation is retrieved, as well as the\nquantum stationary states in a linear or spherical cavity. We compute the\nenergy (and momentum) of the concretion, naturally defined from the energy (and\nmomentum) density of the vibrating elastic medium. Provided one condition about\nthe amplitude of oscillation is fulfilled, it strikingly appears that the\nenergy and momentum of the concretion not only are written in the same form as\nin quantum mechanics, but also encapsulate equivalent relativistic formulas.\n", "  We point out that in the minimal left-right realization of TeV scale seesaw\nfor neutrino masses, the neutral scalar from the right-handed $SU(2)_R$\nbreaking sector could be much lighter than the right-handed scale. We discuss\nfor the first time the constraints on this particle from low-energy flavor\nobservables, find that the light scalar is necessarily long-lived. We show that\nit can be searched for at the LHC via displaced signals of a collimated photon\njet, and can also be tested in current and future high-intensity experiments.\nIn contrast to the unique diphoton signal (and associated jets) in the\nleft-right case, a generic beyond Standard Model light scalar decays mostly to\nleptons or jets. Thus, the diphoton channel proposed here provides a new avenue\nto test the left-right framework and reveal the underlying neutrino mass\ngeneration mechanism.\n", "  We have developed a novel method for crystalline hydrogenation of graphene on\nthe nanoscale. Molecular hydrogen was physisorbed at 5 K onto pristine graphene\nislands grown on Cu(111) in ultrahigh vacuum. Field emission local to the tip\nof a scanning tunneling microscope dissociates H$_2$ and results in\nhydrogenated graphene. At lower coverage, isolated point defects are found on\nthe graphene and are attributed to chemisorbed H on top and bottom surfaces.\nRepeated H$_2$ exposure and field emission yielded patches and then complete\ncoverage of a crystalline $\\sqrt{3}$ $\\times$ $\\sqrt{3}$ R30{\\deg} phase, as\nwell as less densely packed 3 $\\times$ 3 and 4 $\\times$ 4 structures. The\nhydrogenation can be reversed by imaging with higher bias voltage.\n", "  The interaction of qubits with quantized modes of electromagnetic fields has\nbeen largely addressed in the quantum optics literature under the rotating wave\napproximation (RWA), where rapid oscillating terms in the qubit-mode\ninteraction picture Hamiltonian can be neglected. At the same time, it is\ngenerally accepted that provided the interaction is sufficiently strong or for\nlong times, the RWA tends to describe physical phenomena incorrectly. In this\nwork, we extend the investigation of the validity of the RWA to a more involved\nsetup where two qubit-mode subsystems are brought to interaction through their\nharmonic coordinates. Our treatment is all analytic thanks to a sequence of\ncarefully chosen unitary transformations which allows us to diagonlize the\nHamiltonian within and without the RWA. By also considering qubit dephasing, we\nfind that the purity of the two-qubit state presents non-Markovian features\nwhich become more pronounced as the coupling between the modes gets stronger\nand the RWA loses its validity. In the same regime, there occurs fast\ngeneration of entanglement between the qubits which is also not correctly\ndescribed under the RWA. The setup and results presented here clearly show the\nlimitations of the RWA in a scenario amenable to exact description and free\nfrom numerical uncertainties. Consequently, it may be of interest for the\ncommunity working with cavity or circuit quantum electrodynamic systems in the\nstrong coupling regime.\n", "  A synopsis is offered of the properties of discrete and integer-valued, hence\n\"natural\", cellular automata (CA). A particular class comprises the\n\"Hamiltonian CA\" with discrete updating rules that resemble Hamilton's\nequations. The resulting dynamics is linear like the unitary evolution\ndescribed by the Schr\\\"odinger equation. Employing Shannon's Sampling Theorem,\nwe construct an invertible map between such CA and continuous quantum\nmechanical models which incorporate a fundamental discreteness scale $l$.\nConsequently, there is a one-to-one correspondence of quantum mechanical and CA\nconservation laws. We discuss the important issue of linearity, recalling that\nnonlinearities imply nonlocal effects in the continuous quantum mechanical\ndescription of intrinsically local discrete CA - requiring locality entails\nlinearity. The admissible CA observables and the existence of solutions of the\n$l$-dependent dispersion relation for stationary states are mentioned, besides\nthe construction of multipartite CA obeying the Superposition Principle. We\npoint out problems when trying to match the deterministic CA here to those\nenvisioned in 't Hooft's CA Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.\n", "  Grid based fluid simulation methods are not able to monolithically capture\ncomplex non-linear dynamics like the rupture of a dynamic liquid bridge between\nfreely colliding solids, an exemplary scenario of capillary forces competing\nwith inertial forces in engineering applications. We introduce a new\nIncompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method for simulating three\ndimensional fluid-solid interaction flows with capillary (wetting and surface\ntension) effects at free surfaces. This meshless approach presents significant\nadvantages over grid based approaches in terms of being monolithic and in\nhandling interaction with free solids. The method is validated for accuracy and\nstability in dynamic scenarios involving surface tension and wetting. We then\npresent three dimensional simulations of crown forming instability following\nthe splash of a liquid drop, and the rupture of a liquid bridge between two\ncolliding solid spheres, to show the method's advantages in the study of\ndynamic micromechanical phenomena involving capillary flows.\n", "  In this work we propose a new general model of eternal cyclic Universe. We\nstart from the assumption that quantum gravity corrections can be effectively\naccounted by the addition of higher order curvature terms in the Lagrangian\ndensity for gravity. It is also taken into account that coefficients associated\nwith these curvature corrections will in general be dependent on a curvature\nregime. We therewith assume no new ingredients, such as extra dimensions, new\nscalar fields, phantom energy or special space-time geometries. Evolution of\nthe Universe in this framework is studied and general properties of each phase\nof the cycle - cosmological bounce, low curvature ($\\Lambda$CDM) phase,\ndestruction of bounded systems and contracting phase - are analysed in detail.\nFocusing on some simple special cases, we obtain analytical and numerical\nsolutions for the each phase confirming our analysis.\n", "  The aim of the present paper is to introduce and to discuss the most basic\nfundamental concepts of quantum physics by means of a simple and pedagogical\nexample. An appreciable part of its content presents original results. We start\nwith the Euclidean plane which is certainly a paradigmatic example of a Hilbert\nspace. The pure states form the unit circle (actually a half of it), the mixed\nstates form the unit disk (actually a half of it), and rotations in the plane\nrule time evolution through Majorana-like equations involving only real\nquantities for closed and open systems. The set of pure states or a set of\nmixed states solve the identity and they are used for understanding the concept\nof integral quantization of functions on the unit circle and to give a\nsemi-classical portrait of quantum observables. Interesting probabilistic\naspects are developed. Since the tensor product of two planes, their direct\nsum, their cartesian product, are isomorphic (2 is the unique solution to x^x=\nx\\times x = x+x), and they are also isomorphic to C^2, and to the quaternion\nfield H (as a vector space), we describe an interesting relation between\nentanglement of real states, one-half spin cat states, and unit-norm\nquaternions which form the group SU$(2)$. We explain the most general form of\nthe Hamiltonian in the real plane by considering the integral quantization of a\nmagnetic-like interaction potential viewed as a classical observable on the\nunit $2$-sphere. Finally, we present an example of quantum measurement with\npointer states lying also in the Euclidean plane.\n", "  We study the interplay of control and parameter estimation on a quantum spin\nchain. A single qubit probe is attached to one end of the chain, while we wish\nto estimate a parameter on the other end. We find that control on the probe\nqubit can substantially improve the estimation performance and discover some\ninteresting connections to quantum state transfer.\n", "  We study quantum tunnelling in Dante's Inferno model of large field\ninflation. Such a tunnelling process, which will terminate inflation, becomes\nproblematic if the tunnelling rate is rapid compared to the Hubble time scale\nat the time of inflation. Consequently, we constrain the parameter space of\nDante's Inferno model by demanding a suppressed tunnelling rate during\ninflation. The constraints are derived and explicit numerical bounds are\nprovided for representative examples. Our considerations are at the level of an\neffective field theory; hence, the presented constraints have to hold\nregardless of any UV completion.\n", "  We study the two-body problem for two-dimensional electron systems in a\nsymmetrized Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model which is widely used to describe\ntopological and conventional insulators. The main result is that two\ninteracting electrons can form bound states with the energy in the gap of the\nband spectrum. The pairing mechanism can be interpreted as the formation of a\nnegative reduced effective mass of two electrons. The problem is complicated\nbecause the relative motion of the electrons is coupled to the center-of-mass\nmotion. We consider the case of zero total momentum. Detail calculations are\ncarried out for the repulsive interaction potential of steplike form. The\nstates are classified according to their spin structure and two-particle basis\nfunctions that form a given bound state. We analyze the spectra and electronic\nstructure of the bound states in the case of both topological and trivial\nphases and especially focus on effects originating from the band inversion and\nthe coupling of the electron and hole bands. In the trivial phase and the\ntopological phase with the large coupling parameter $a$, the bound state\nspectra are qualitatively similar. However, when $a$ is less a certain value,\nthe situation changes dramatically. In the topological phase, new states arise\nwith a higher binding energy at lower interaction potential, which evidences\nthat the band inversion can favor pairing the electrons.\n", "  We study the possibility of generating tiny Dirac masses of neutrinos in\nLeft-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) without requiring the existence of any\nadditional symmetries. The charged fermions acquire masses through a universal\nseesaw mechanism due to the presence of additional vector like fermions. The\nneutrinos acquire a one-loop Dirac mass from the same additional vector like\ncharged leptons without requiring any additional discrete symmetries. The model\ncan also be extended by an additional $Z_2$ symmetry in order to have a\nscotogenic version of this scenario predicting a stable dark matter candidate.\nWe show that the latest Planck upper bound on the effective number of\nrelativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\\text{eff}}=3.15 \\pm 0.23$ tightly\nconstrains the right sector gauge boson masses to be heavier than 3.548 TeV.\nThis bound on gauge boson mass also affects the allowed values of right scalar\ndoublet dark matter mass from the requirement of satisfying the Planck bound on\ndark matter relic abundance. We also discuss the possible implications of such\na scenario in charged lepton flavour violation and generating observable\nelectric dipole moment of leptons.\n", "  We propose a new analysis of the two--centre problem particularly suited to\nbe used as a basis to study the dynamics of Sun--Earth--Asteroid systems. Our\nmethod, based on a tricky choice of initial coordinates, allows us to evaluate\nthe risk of collisions between the Asteroid and Earth. Moreover, it seems to be\nfitted to prove the existence of chains of transition tori in the planar\nSun--Earth--Asteroid systems.\n", "  We study the consequences of reheating in quintessential inflation. From\nsimple inflationary quintessential models introduced in cite{hap, hap2}, we\nshow that when the reheating is due to the production of heavy massive\nparticles conformally coupled with gravity, a viable model which matches with\nthe current observational data cite{Ade, Planck, bicep2} is only possible for\nreheating temperatures that range between $1$ GeV and $10^4$ GeV. On the other\nhand, when the universe reheats via the production of massless particles, the\nviability of the model is only possible when those particles are nearly\nconformally coupled with gravity, leading to a reheating temperature between\n$1$ MeV and $10^4$ GeV.\n", "  The direct numerical simulation of particulate systems offers a unique\napproach to study the dynamics of fluid-solid suspensions by fully resolving\nthe submerged particles and without introducing empirical models. For the\nlattice Boltzmann method, different variants exist to incorporate the\nfluid-particle interaction into the simulation. This paper provides a detailed\nand systematic comparison of two different methods, namely the momentum\nexchange method and the partially saturated cells method by Noble and\nTorczynski. Three subvariants of each method are used in the benchmark scenario\nof a single heavy sphere settling in ambient fluid to study their\ncharacteristics and accuracy for particle Reynolds numbers from 185 up to 365.\nThe sphere must be resolved with at least 24 computational cells per diameter\nto achieve velocity errors below 5%. The momentum exchange method is found to\nbe more accurate in predicting the streamwise velocity component whereas the\npartially saturated cells method is more accurate in the spanwise components.\nThe study reveals that the resolution should be chosen with respect to the\ncoupling dynamics, and not only based on the flow properties, to avoid large\nerrors in the fluid-particle interaction.\n", "  We investigate the impact of choosing regressors and molecular\nrepresentations for the construction of fast machine learning (ML) models of\nthirteen electronic ground-state properties of organic molecules. The\nperformance of each regressor/representation/property combination is assessed\nusing learning curves which report out-of-sample errors as a function of\ntraining set size with up to $\\sim$117k distinct molecules. Molecular\nstructures and properties at hybrid density functional theory (DFT) level of\ntheory used for training and testing come from the QM9 database [Ramakrishnan\net al, {\\em Scientific Data} {\\bf 1} 140022 (2014)] and include dipole moment,\npolarizability, HOMO/LUMO energies and gap, electronic spatial extent, zero\npoint vibrational energy, enthalpies and free energies of atomization, heat\ncapacity and the highest fundamental vibrational frequency. Various\nrepresentations from the literature have been studied (Coulomb matrix, bag of\nbonds, BAML and ECFP4, molecular graphs (MG)), as well as newly developed\ndistribution based variants including histograms of distances (HD), and angles\n(HDA/MARAD), and dihedrals (HDAD). Regressors include linear models (Bayesian\nridge regression (BR) and linear regression with elastic net regularization\n(EN)), random forest (RF), kernel ridge regression (KRR) and two types of\nneural net works, graph convolutions (GC) and gated graph networks (GG). We\npresent numerical evidence that ML model predictions deviate from DFT less than\nDFT deviates from experiment for all properties. Furthermore, our out-of-sample\nprediction errors with respect to hybrid DFT reference are on par with, or\nclose to, chemical accuracy. Our findings suggest that ML models could be more\naccurate than hybrid DFT if explicitly electron correlated quantum (or\nexperimental) data was available.\n", "  The Wasserstein metric is introduced as a probabilistic method to enable\nquantitative evaluations of LES combustion models. The Wasserstein metric can\ndirectly be evaluated from scatter data or statistical results using\nprobabilistic reconstruction against experimental data. The method is derived\nand generalized for turbulent reacting flows, and applied to validation tests\ninvolving the Sydney piloted jet flame. It is shown that the Wasserstein metric\nis an effective validation tool that extends to multiple scalar quantities,\nproviding an objective and quantitative evaluation of model deficiencies and\nboundary conditions on the simulation accuracy. Several test cases are\nconsidered, beginning with a comparison of mixture-fraction results, and the\nsubsequent extension to reactive scalars, including temperature and species\nmass fractions of \\ce{CO} and \\ce{CO2}. To demonstrate the versatility of the\nproposed method in application to multiple datasets, the Wasserstein metric is\napplied to a series of different simulations that were contributed to the\nTNF-workshop. Analysis of the results allowed to identify competing\ncontributions to model deviations, arising from uncertainties in the boundary\nconditions and model deficiencies. These applications demonstrate that the\nWasserstein metric constitutes an easily applicable mathematical tool that\nreduce multiscalar combustion data and large datasets into a scalar-valued\nquantitative measure.\n", "  In this work, we interface high temperature Z-meter setup to automize the\nwhole measurement process. A program is built on open source programming\nlanguage Python which convert the manual measurement process into fully\nautomated process without any cost addition. Using this program, simultaneous\nmeasurement of Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity and electrical\nresistivity are performed and using all three, figure-of-merit (ZT) is\ncalculated. Developed program is verified by performing measurement over p-type\nBi0.36Sb1.45Te3 sample and the data obtained are found to be in good agreement\nwith the reported data.\n", "  Random constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) have been studied extensively\nusing statistical physics techniques. They provide a benchmark to study average\ncase scenarios instead of the worst case one. The interplay between statistical\nphysics of disordered systems and computer science has brought new light into\nthe realm of computational complexity theory, by introducing the notion of\nclustering of solutions, related to replica symmetry breaking. However, the\nclass of problems in which clustering has been studied often involve discrete\ndegrees of freedom: standard random CSPs are random K-SAT (aka disordered Ising\nmodels) or random coloring problems (aka disordered Potts models). In this work\nwe consider instead problems that involve continuous degrees of freedom. The\nsimplest prototype of these problems is the perceptron. Here we discuss in\ndetail the full phase diagram of the model. In the regions of parameter space\nwhere the problem is non-convex, leading to multiple disconnected clusters of\nsolutions, the solution is critical at the SAT/UNSAT threshold and lies in the\nsame universality class of the jamming transition of soft spheres. We show how\nthe critical behavior at the satisfiability threshold emerges, and we compute\nthe critical exponents associated to the approach to the transition from both\nthe SAT and UNSAT phase. We conjecture that there is a large universality class\nof non-convex continuous CSPs whose SAT-UNSAT threshold is described by the\nsame scaling solution.\n", "  By making use of the chiral kinetic theory in the relaxation-time\napproximation, we derive an Israel-Stewart type formulation of the hydrodynamic\nequations for a chiral relativistic plasma made of neutral particles (e.g.,\nneutrinos). The effects of chiral asymmetry are captured by including an\nadditional continuity equation for the axial charge, as well as the\nleading-order quantum corrections due to the spin of particles. In a\nformulation of the chiral kinetic theory used, we introduce a symmetric form of\nthe energy-momentum tensor that is suitable for the description of a weakly\nnonuniform chiral plasma. By construction, the energy and momentum are\nconserved to the same leading order in the Planck constant as the kinetic\nequation itself. By making use of such a chiral kinetic theory and the\nChapman-Enskog approach, we obtain a set of second-order dissipative\nhydrodynamic equations. The effects of the fluid vorticity and velocity\nfluctuations on the dispersion relations of chiral vortical waves are analyzed.\n", "  The cosmological evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs) is considered. A\ncomprehensive view of the accretion and evaporation histories of PBHs across\nthe entire cosmic history is presented, with focus on the critical mass holes.\nThe critical mass of a PBH for current era evaporation is $M_{cr}\\sim\n5.1\\times10^{14}$ g. Across cosmic time such a black hole will not accrete\nradiation or matter in sufficient quantity to hasten the inevitable\nevaporation, if the black hole remains within an average volume of the\nuniverse. The accretion rate onto PBHs is most sensitive to the mass of the\nhole, the sound speed in the cosmological fluid, and the energy density of the\naccreted components. It is not easy for a PBH to accrete the average\ncosmological fluid to reach $30M_\\odot$ by $z\\sim0.1$, the approximate mass and\nredshift of the merging BHs that were the sources of the gravitational wave\nevents GW150914 and GW151226. A PBH located in an overdense region can undergo\nenhanced accretion leading to the possibility of growing by many orders of\nmagnitude across cosmic history. Thus, two merging PBHs are a plausible source\nfor the observed gravitational wave events. However, it is difficult for\nisolated PBHs to grow to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshift with\nmasses large enough to fit observational constraints.\n", "  In this work, we utilize the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a massless scalar\nperturbation to probe the Van der Waals-like small and large black holes\n(SBH/LBH) phase transition of charged topological Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black\nholes in four-dimensional massive gravity. We find that the signature of this\nSBH/LBH phase transition is detected in the isobaric as well as in the\nisothermal process.This further supports the idea that the QNMs can be an\nefficient tool to investigate the thermodynamical phase transition.\n", "  Inspired by Lifshitz theory for quantum critical phenomena in condensed\nmatter, Horava proposed a theory for quantum gravity with an anisotropic\nscaling in ultraviolet. In Horava-Lifshitz gravity (HLG), we have studied the\nimpacts of six types of equations of state on the evolution of various\ncosmological parameters such as Hubble parameters and scale factor. From the\ncomparison of the general relativity gravity with the HLG with detailed and\nwithout with non-detailed balance conditions, remarkable differences are found.\nAlso, a noticeable dependence of singular and non-singular Big Bang on the\nequations of state is observed. We conclude that HLG explains various epochs in\nthe early universe and might be able to reproduce the entire cosmic history\nwith and without singular Big Bang.\n", "  We study a simplified model of top-flavoured dark matter in the framework of\nDark Minimal Flavour Violation. In this setup the coupling of the dark matter\nflavour triplet to right-handed up-type quarks constitutes the only new source\nof flavour and CP violation. The parameter space of the model is restricted by\nLHC searches with missing energy final states, by neutral $D$ meson mixing\ndata, by the observed dark matter relic abundance, and by the absence of signal\nin direct detection experiments. We consider all of these constraints in turn,\nstudying their implications for the allowed parameter space. Imposing the mass\nlimits and coupling benchmarks from collider searches, we then conduct a\ncombined analysis of all the other constraints, revealing their non-trivial\ninterplay. Especially interesting is the combination of direct detection and\nrelic abundance constraints, having a severe impact on the structure of the\ndark matter coupling matrix. We point out that future bounds from upcoming\ndirect detection experiments, such as XENON1T, XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN, and DARWIN,\nwill exclude a large part of the parameter space and push the DM mass to higher\nvalues.\n", "  Although many of the observed properties of giant radio relics detected in\nthe outskirts of galaxy clusters can be explained by relativistic electrons\naccelerated at merger-driven shocks, significant puzzles remain. In the case of\nthe so-called Toothbrush relic, the shock Mach number estimated from X-ray\nobservations ($M_{\\rm X}\\approx1.2-1.5$) is substantially weaker than that\ninferred from the radio spectral index ($M_{\\rm rad}\\approx2.8$).Toward\nunderstanding such a discrepancy, we here consider the following diffusive\nshock acceleration (DSA) models:(1) weak-shock models with $M_{\\rm s}\\lesssim\n2$ and a preexisting population of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) with a flat\nenergy spectrum,and (2) strong-shock models with $M_{\\rm s}\\approx3$ and either\nshock-generated suprathermal electrons or preexisting fossil CRe. We calculate\nthe synchrotron emission from the accelerated CRe, following the time evolution\nof the electron DSA, and subsequent radiative cooling and postshock turbulent\nacceleration (TA). We find that both models could reproduce reasonably well the\nobserved integrated radio spectrum of the Toothbrush relic, but the observed\nbroad transverse profile requires the stochastic acceleration by downstream\nturbulence, which we label \"turbulent acceleration\" or TA to distinguish it\nfrom DSA. Moreover, to account for the almost uniform radio spectral index\nprofile along the length of the relic, the weak-shock models require a preshock\nregion over 400~kpc with a uniform population of preexisting CRe with a high\ncutoff energy ($\\gtrsim 40$ GeV). Due to the short cooling time, it is\nchallenging to explain the origin of such energetic electrons. Therefore, we\nsuggest the strong-shock models with low-energy seed CRe ($\\lesssim 150$~MeV)\nare preferred for the radio observations of this relic.\n", "  We report on resistive switching of memristive electrochemical metallization\ndevices using 3D kinetic Monte Carlo simulations describing the transport of\nions through a solid state electrolyte of an Ag/TiO$_{\\text{x}}$/Pt thin layer\nsystem. The ion transport model is consistently coupled with solvers for the\nelectric field and thermal diffusion. We show that the model is able to\ndescribe not only the formation of conducting filaments but also its\ndissolution. Furthermore, we calculate realistic current-voltage\ncharacteristics and resistive switching kinetics. Finally, we discuss in detail\nthe influence of both the electric field and the local heat on the switching\nprocesses of the device.\n", "  A time-reversal (TR) invariant topological superconductor is characterized by\na Kramers pair of Majorana zero-energy modes on boundaries and in a core of a\nTR invariant vortex. A vortex defect that preserves TR symmetry has remained\nprimarily of theoretical interest, since typically a magnetic field, which\nexplicitly breaks TR, needs to be applied to create vortices in\nsuperconductors. In this work, we show that an odd-parity topological\nsuperconductor with a nematic pairing order parameter can host a nematic vortex\nthat preserves TR symmetry and binds a Majorana Kramers pair. Such a nematic\nsuperconductor could be realized in metal-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$, as suggested by\nrecent experiments. We provide an analytic solution for the zero modes in a\ncontinuous nematic vortex. In lattice, crystalline anisotropy can pin the\ntwo-component order parameter along high-symmetry directions. We show that a\ndiscrete nematic vortex, which forms when three nematic domains meet, also\nsupports a TR pair of Majorana modes. Finally, we discuss possible experiments\nto probe the zero modes.\n", "  An important challenge in condensed matter physics is understanding\niron-based superconductors. Among these systems, the iron selenides hold the\nrecord for highest superconducting transition temperature and pose especially\nstriking puzzles regarding the nature of superconductivity. The pairing state\nof the alkaline iron selenides appears to be of $d$-wave type based on the\nobservation of a resonance mode in neutron scattering, while it seems to be of\n$s$-wave type from the nodeless gaps observed everywhere on the Fermi surface\n(FS). Here we propose an orbital-selective pairing state, dubbed $s \\tau_{3}$,\nas a natural explanation of these disparate properties. The pairing function,\ncontaining a matrix $\\tau_{3}$ in the basis of $3d$-electron orbitals, does not\ncommute with the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian. This dictates the existence\nof both intraband and interband pairing terms in the band basis. A spin\nresonance arises from a $d$-wave-type sign change in the intraband pairing\ncomponent whereas the quasiparticle excitation is fully gapped on the FS due to\nan $s$-wave-like form factor associated with the addition in quadrature of the\nintraband and interband pairing terms. We demonstrate that this pairing state\nis energetically favored when the electron correlation effects are orbitally\nselective. More generally, our results illustrate how the multiband nature of\ncorrelated electrons affords unusual types of superconducting states, thereby\nshedding new light not only on the iron-based materials but also on a broad\nrange of other unconventional superconductors such as heavy fermion and organic\nsystems.\n", "  We investigate the hydrostatic pressure dependence of interfacial\nsuperconductivity occurring at the atomically sharp interface between two\nnon-superconducting materials: the topological insulator (TI) Bi2Te3 and the\nparent compound Fe1+yTe of the chalcogenide iron based superconductors. Under\npressure, a significant increase in the superconducting transition temperature\nTc is observed. We trace the pressure dependence of a superconducting twin gap\nstructure by Andreev reflection point contact spectroscopy (PCARS), which shows\nthat a large superconducting gap associated with the interfacial\nsuperconductivity increases along with Tc. A second smaller gap, which is\nattributed to proximity-induced superconductivity in the TI layer, increases\nfirst, but then reaches a maximum and appears to be gradually suppressed at\nhigher pressure. We interpret our data in the context of a pressure-induced\ndoping effect of the interface, in which charge is transferred from the TI\nlayer to the interface and the interfacial superconductivity is enhanced. This\ndemonstrates the important role of the TI in the interfacial superconductivity\nmechanism.\n", "  EUSO-SPB2 is a second generation Extreme Universe Space Observatory (EUSO) on\na Super-Pressure Balloon (SPB). This document describes the physics\ncapabilities, the proposed technical design of the instruments, and the\nsimulation and analysis software.\n", "  Efficiently characterising quantum systems, verifying operations of quantum\ndevices and validating underpinning physical models, are central challenges for\nthe development of quantum technologies and for our continued understanding of\nfoundational physics. Machine-learning enhanced by quantum simulators has been\nproposed as a route to improve the computational cost of performing these\nstudies. Here we interface two different quantum systems through a classical\nchannel - a silicon-photonics quantum simulator and an electron spin in a\ndiamond nitrogen-vacancy centre - and use the former to learn the latter's\nHamiltonian via Bayesian inference. We learn the salient Hamiltonian parameter\nwith an uncertainty of approximately $10^{-5}$. Furthermore, an observed\nsaturation in the learning algorithm suggests deficiencies in the underlying\nHamiltonian model, which we exploit to further improve the model itself. We go\non to implement an interactive version of the protocol and experimentally show\nits ability to characterise the operation of the quantum photonic device. This\nwork demonstrates powerful new quantum-enhanced techniques for investigating\nfoundational physical models and characterising quantum technologies.\n", "  We demonstrate that a flat-band state in a quasi-one-dimensional rhombic\nlattice is robust in the presence of external drivings along the lattice axis.\nThe lattice was formed by periodic arrays of evanescently coupled optical\nwaveguides, and the external drivings were realized by modulating the paths of\nthe waveguides. We excited a superposition of flat-band eigenmodes at the input\nand observed that this state does not diffract in the presence of static as\nwell as high-frequency sinusoidal drivings. This robust localization is due to\ndestructive interference of the analogous wavefunction and is associated with\nthe symmetry in the lattice geometry. We then excited the dispersive bands and\nobserved Bloch oscillations and coherent destruction of tunneling.\n{\\textcopyright} 2017 Optical Society of America.\n", "  Here we report the electronic structure of FeS, a recently identified\niron-based superconductor. Our high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy studies show two hole-like ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$) and two\nelectron-like ($\\eta$ and $\\delta$) Fermi pockets around the Brillouin zone\ncenter and corner, respectively, all of which exhibit moderate dispersion along\n$k_z$. However, a third hole-like band ($\\gamma$) is not observed, which is\nexpected around the zone center from band calculations and is common in\niron-based superconductors. Since this band has the highest renormalization\nfactor and is known to be the most vulnerable to defects, its absence in our\ndata is likely due to defect scattering --- and yet superconductivity can exist\nwithout coherent quasiparticles in the $\\gamma$ band. This may help resolve the\ncurrent controversy on the superconducting gap structure of FeS. Moreover, by\ncomparing the $\\beta$ bandwidths of various iron chalcogenides, including FeS,\nFeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, FeSe, and FeSe$_{1-x}$ Te$_x$, we find that the $\\beta$\nbandwidth of FeS is the broadest. However, the band renormalization factor of\nFeS is still quite large, when compared with the band calculations, which\nindicates sizable electron correlations. This explains why the unconventional\nsuperconductivity can persist over such a broad range of isovalent substitution\nin FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ and FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$.\n", "  Suspended optical microresonators are promising devices for on-chip photonic\napplications such as radio-frequency oscillators, optical frequency combs, and\nsensors. Scaling up these devices demand the capability to tune the optical\nresonances in an integrated manner. Here, we design and experimentally\ndemonstrate integrated on-chip thermo-optic tuning of suspended microresonators\nby utilizing suspended wire bridges and microheaters. We demonstrate the\nability to tune the resonance of a suspended microresonator in silicon nitride\nplatform by 9.7 GHz using 5.3 mW of heater power. The loaded optical quality\nfactor (QL ~ 92,000) stays constant throughout the detuning. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of our approach by completely turning on and off the optical coupling\nbetween two evanescently coupled suspended microresonators.\n", "  In the present work, new classes of wavelet functions are presented in the\nframework of Clifford analysis. Firstly, some classes of new monogenic\npolynomials are provided based on 2-parameters weight functions. Such classes\nextend the well known Jacobi-Gegenbauer ones. The discovered polynomial sets\nare next applied to introduce new wavelet functions. Reconstruction formula as\nwell as Fourier-Plancherel rules have been proved.\n", "  The ELUCID project aims to build a series of realistic cosmological\nsimulations that reproduce the spatial and mass distribution of the galaxies as\nobserved in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This requires powerful\nreconstruction techniques to create constrained initial conditions. We test the\nreconstruction method by applying it to several $N$-body simulations. We use 2\nmedium resolution simulations from each of which three additional constrained\n$N$-body simulations were produced. We compare the resulting friend of friend\ncatalogs by using the particle indexes as tracers, and quantify the quality of\nthe reconstruction by varying the main smoothing parameter. The cross\nidentification method we use proves to be efficient, and the results suggest\nthat the most massive reconstructed halos are effectively traced from the same\nLagrangian regions in the initial conditions. Preliminary time dependence\nanalysis indicates that high mass end halos converge only at a redshift close\nto the reconstruction redshift. This suggests that, for earlier snapshots, only\ncollections of progenitors may be effectively cross-identified.\n", "  We demonstrate that non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems with spontaneously\nbroken PT-symmetry and partially complex eigenvalue spectrum can be made\nmeaningful in a quantum mechanical sense when introducing some explicit\ntime-dependence into their parameters. Exploiting the fact that explicitly\ntime-dependent non-Hermitian Hamitonians are unobservable and not identical to\nthe energy operators in such a scenario, we show that their corresponding\nnon-Hermitian energy operators develop a different type of PT-symmetry from the\nHamiltonians that ensures the reality of their energy spectra. For this purpose\nwe analytically solve the fully time-dependent Dyson equation with all\nquantities involved being explicitly time-dependent giving rise to a\ntime-dependent metric. The key auxiliary equation to be solved for the two\nlevel atomic system considered here is the nonlinear Ermakov-Pinney equation\nwith time-dependent coefficients.\n", "  A geometrical approach to the covariant formulation of the dynamics of\nrelativistic systems is introduced. A realization of Peierls brackets by means\nof a bivector field over the space of solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations\nof a variational principle is presented. The method is illustrated with some\nrelevant examples.\n", "  The quantum hidden subgroup approach is an actively studied approach to solve\ncombinatorial problems in quantum complexity theory. With the success of the\nShor's algorithm, it was hoped that similar approach may be useful to solve the\nother combinatorial problems. One such problem is the graph isomorphism problem\nwhich has survived decades of efforts using the hidden subgroup approach. This\npaper provides a systematic approach to create arbitrarily large classes of\nclassically efficiently solvable graph automorphism problems or easy graph\nautomorphism problems for which hidden subgroup approach is guaranteed to\nalways fail irrespective of the size of the graphs no matter how many copies of\ncoset states are used. As the graph isomorphism problem is believed to be at\nleast as hard as the graph automorphism problem, the result of this paper\nentails that the hidden subgroup approach is also guaranteed to always fail for\nthe arbitrarily large classes of graph isomorphism problems. Combining these\ntwo results, it is argued that the hidden subgroup approach is essentially a\ndead end and alternative quantum algorithmic approach needs to be investigated\nfor the graph isomorphism and automorphism problems.\n", "  We find an explicit solution of the source free Maxwell equations in a\ngeneralized Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetime in all dimensions. This solution is\nobtained as a linear combination of the closed conformal Killing-Yano tensor\n$h_{ab}$, which is present in such a spacetime, and a derivative of the primary\nKilling vector, associated with $h_{ab}$. For the vanishing cosmological\nconstant the obtained solution reduces to the Wald's electromagnetic field\ngenerated from the primary Killing vector.\n", "  The structural phase transition in hexagonal BaMnO$_3$ occurring at $T_c$=130\nK was studied in ceramic samples using electron and X-ray diffraction, second\nharmonic generation as well as by dielectric and lattice dynamic\nspectroscopies. The low-temperature phase (space group $P6_{3}cm$) is\nferroelectric with a triplicated unit cell. The phase transition is driven by\nan optical soft mode from the Brillouin-zone boundary [$q =\n(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{3},0)$]; this mode activates in infrared and Raman\nspectra below $T_c$ and it hardens according to the Cochran law. Upon cooling\nbelow $T_c$, the permittivity exhibits an unusual linear increase with\ntemperature; below 60 K, in turn, a frequency-dependent decrease is observed,\nwhich can be explained by slowing-down of ferroelectric domain wall motions.\nBased on our data we could not distinguish whether the high-temperature phase\nis paraelectric or polar (space groups $P6_{3}/mmc$ or $P6_{3}mc$,\nrespectively). Both variants of the phase transition to the ferroelectric phase\nare discussed based on the Landau theory. Electron paramagnetic resonance and\nmagnetic susceptibility measurements reveal an onset of one-dimensional\nantiferromagnetic ordering below $\\approx220\\,\\rm K$ which develops fully near\n140 K and, below $T_{n} \\approx 59\\,\\rm K$, it transforms into a\nthree-dimensional antiferromagnetic order.\n", "  While the observed nearly scale-invariant initial power spectrum is regarded\nas one of the favorable evidence of the standard inflationary cosmology,\nprecision observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies\nalso suggest possible existence of nontrivial features such as those observed\naround multipoles $\\ell\\sim120$ by WMAP. Here, we examine the Planck data and\ninvestigate the effects of these features on the cosmological parameter\nestimation performing the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) analysis. We find\nthat the features exist in the Planck data at the same position as the case of\nthe WMAP data but they do not affect the cosmological parameter estimation\nsignificantly.\n", "  With a model for two-dimensional (2D) Brownian rotary ratchets being capable\nof producing a net torque under athermal random forces, its optimization for\nmean angular momentum ($L$), mean angular velocity ($\\omega$), and efficiency\n($\\eta$) is considered. In the model, supposing that such a small ratchet\nsystem is placed in a thermal bath, the motion of the rotor in the stator is\ndescribed by the Langevin dynamics of a particle in a 2D ratchet potential,\nwhich consists of a static and a time-dependent interaction between rotor and\nstator; for the latter, we examine a force [randomly directed d.c. field\n(RDDF)] for which only the direction is instantaneously updated in a sequence\nof events in a Poisson process. Because of the chirality of the static part of\nthe potential, it is found that the RDDF causes net rotation while coupling\nwith the thermal fluctuations. Then, to maximize the efficiency of the power\nconsumption of the net rotation, we consider optimizing the static part of the\nratchet potential. A crucial point is that the newly designed form of ratchet\npotential enables us to capture the essential feature of 2D ratchet potentials\nwith two closed curves and allows us to systematically construct an\noptimization strategy. In this paper, we show a method for maximizing $L$,\n$\\omega$, and $\\eta$, its outcome in 2D two-tooth ratchet systems, and a\ndirection of optimization for a three-tooth ratchet system.\n", "  Pipelines are used in a huge range of industrial processes involving fluids,\nand the ability to accurately predict properties of the flow through a pipe is\nof fundamental engineering importance. Armed with parallel MPI, Arnoldi and\nNewton--Krylov solvers, the Openpipeflow code can be used in a range of\nsettings, from large-scale simulation of highly turbulent flow, to the detailed\nanalysis of nonlinear invariant solutions (equilibria and periodic orbits) and\ntheir influence on the dynamics of the flow.\n", "  The ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density in low energy heavy-ion\ncollision has been calculated by using the Green-Kubo method in the framework\nof an extended quantum molecular dynamics model. After the system almost\nreaching a local equilibration for a head-on $^{40}$Ca+$^{100}$Mo collision,\nthermodynamic and transport properties are extracted. Meanwhile, iso-vector\ngiant dipole resonance (IVGDR) of the collision system is also studied. By the\nGaussian fits to the IVGDR photon spectra, the peak energies of IVGDR are\nextracted at different incident energies. The result shows that the IVGDR peak\nenergy has a positive correlation with the ratio of shear viscosity over\nentropy density. This is a quantum effect and indicates a difference between\nnuclear matter and classical fluid.\n", "  The deformation evolution of giant dipole resonance (GDR), in the chains of\nSm and Nd isotopes, are investigated in the framework of an extended quantum\nmolecular dynamics (EQMD) model. The mass number dependence of resonance peak\nposition $(E_{m})$ in the major and minor axis directions of deformed nuclei as\nwell as the difference $\\Delta E_{m}$ between them are described in detail. The\ncorrelation between the splitting ($\\Delta E_{m} /\\bar{E}_m $) of the GDR\nspectra and the deformation($ \\beta_{2}$) is further studied. The results\nconfirm that $\\Delta E_{m} /\\bar{E}_m $ is proportional to $ \\beta_{2}$. By\ncomparing the calculation with the experimental data on photon absorption cross\nsection $\\sigma_{\\gamma}$, it shows that the EQMD model can quite well\nreproduce the shape of GDR spectra from spherical to prolate shape. The GDR\nshapes in $^{134}$Sm, $^{136}$Sm, $^{138}$Sm, $^{130}$Nd, $^{132}$Nd and\n$^{134}$Nd are also predicted. In addition, the symmetry energy coefficient\n$(E_{sym})$ dependence of GDR spectra of $^{150}$Nd is also discussed. It is\nfound that the calculated GDR spectrum in the EQMD model is perfectly\nconsistent with the experimental results when $E_{sym}$ equals to 32 MeV.\n", "  The postulate that coordinate and momentum representations are related to\neach other by the Fourier transform has been accepted from the beginning of\nquantum theory. As a consequence, coordinate wave functions of photons emitted\nby stars have cosmic sizes. This results in a paradox because predictions of\nthe theory contradict observations. The reason of the paradox and its\nresolution are discussed.\n", "  We investigate the orbit equations and the eikonal equation for light\nrespectively, under influence of the hairy black holes (asymptotically flat) in\nfour dimensions. We consider two hairy black hole solutions with non-trivial\npotentials, and one of these solutions has Schwarzschild case as a smooth\nlimit. Following to Landau and Lifshitz, we use the Hamilton-Jacobi method, and\nwe show hairy corrections for periapsis shift, where the effect of the hair is\nto increase it. In the same way, using the eikonal equation we show the\ndeflection of the light and the relevant scalar hair corrections. Interestingly\nwe find that the hair screening the gravitational field, decreasing the angle\nof deflection as the hair increases.\n", "  We study a dimerised spin chain with biaxial magnetic interacting ions in the\npresence of an externally induced three-site interactions out of equilibrium.\nIn the general case, the three-site interactions play a role in renormalizing\nthe effective uniform magnetic field. We find that the existence of zero-energy\nMajorana modes is intricately related to the sign of Pfaffian of the\nBogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and the relevant $Z_2$ topological invariant.\nIn contrast, we show that an exotic spin liquid phase can emerge in the compass\nlimit through a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) quantum phase transition.\nSuch a BKT transition is characterized by a large dynamic exponent $z=4$, and\nthe spin-liquid phase is robust under a uniform magnetic field. We find the\nrelative entropy and the quantum discord can signal the BKT transitions. We\nalso uncover a few differences in deriving the correlation functions for the\nsystems with broken reflection symmetry.\n", "  In this work we study oscillating soliton stars (oscillatons) with network of\ndomain walls. We consider a Lagrangian with three scalar fields coupled among\nthemselves by a specific potential. We choose an appropriate potential to admit\nthe formation of network of domain walls on the oscillatons. With small\nperturbations applied to this potential, we then compute the\nEinstein-Klein-Gordon (EKG) equations numerically and analyze the mass profile\nof this new object. From the results we discuss how the stability of the\noscillatons is affected by the network. At some conditions the network provides\na `bouncing stability' to the oscillatons.\n", "  Brownian motion has served as a pilot of studies in diffusion and other\ntransport phenomena for over a century. The foundation of Brownian motion, laid\nby Einstein, has generally been accepted to be far from being complete since\nthe late 1960s, because it fails to take important hydrodynamic effects into\naccount. The hydrodynamic effects yield a time dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient, and this extends the ordinary hydrodynamics. However, the time\nprofile of the diffusion coefficient across the kinetic and hydrodynamic\nregions is still absent, which prohibits a complete description of Brownian\nmotion in the entire course of time. Here we close this gap. We manage to\nseparate the diffusion process into two parts: a kinetic process governed by\nthe kinetics based on molecular chaos approximation and a hydrodynamics process\ndescribed by linear hydrodynamics. We find the analytical solution of vortex\nbackflow of hydrodynamic modes triggered by a tagged particle. Coupling it to\nthe kinetic process we obtain explicit expressions of the velocity\nautocorrelation function and the time profile of diffusion coefficient. This\nleads to an accurate account of both kinetic and hydrodynamic effects. Our\ntheory is applicable for fluid and Brownian particles, even of irregular-shaped\nobjects, in very general environments ranging from dilute gases to dense\nliquids. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical\nexperiments.\n", "  Verlinde (2016) has proposed a new modified theory of gravity, Emergent\nGravity (EG), as an alternative to dark matter. EG reproduces the Tully-Fisher\nrelationship with no free parameters, and agrees with the velocity curves of\nmost massive, spiral galaxies well. In its current form, the theory only\napplies to isolated, spherically symmetric systems in a dark energy-dominated\nUniverse, and thus can only be tested fairly with such systems. Here I develop\nequations for EG's velocity curve predictions given a realistic, extended mass\ndistribution. I apply this to isolated dwarf galaxies. Then I test the\npredictions from EG versus the maximum velocity measurements of 81 isolated\ndwarf galaxies with projected shapes close to circular. I find that EG severely\nunderpredicts the maximum velocities for those galaxies with measured\nvelocities v>165 km/s. Most of these galaxies have greater HI gas masses than\nstellar masses, and it is seems that EG is unable to describe these systems\nwell. Rotation curves of these isolated, HI gas-rich, nearly spherical dwarf\ngalaxies would provide the definitive test of EG.\n", "  A known fact is that an Einstein solution in one sector in ghost-free\nbimetric theory implies an Einstein solution in the other sector. Earlier\nstudies have also shown that some classes of bimetric models necessitate\nproportional solutions between the sectors. Here we consider a general setup of\nthe parameters in the theory as well as the general algebraic form of the\npotential. We show that, if one sector has an Einstein solution, the solutions\nare either proportional or block proportional with at most two different\neigenvalues in the square root governing metric interactions.\n", "  Narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies constitute a class of active galactic\nnuclei characterized by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the H$\\beta$\nbroad emission line < 2000 km/s and the flux ratio of [O III] to H$\\beta$ < 3.\nTheir properties are not well understood since only a few NLSy1 galaxies were\nknown earlier. We have studied various properties of NLSy1 galaxies using an\nenlarged sample and compared them with the conventional broad-line Seyfert 1\n(BLSy1) galaxies. Both the sample of sources have z $\\le$ 0.8 and their optical\nspectra from SDSS-DR12 that are used to derive various physical parameters have\na median signal to noise (S/N) ratio >10 per pixel. Strong correlations between\nthe H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$ emission lines are found both in the FWHM and flux.\nThe nuclear continuum luminosity is found to be strongly correlated with the\nluminosity of H$\\beta$, H$\\alpha$ and [O III] emission lines. The black hole\nmass in NLSy1 galaxies is lower compared to their broad line counterparts.\nCompared to BLSy1 galaxies, NLSy1 galaxies have a stronger FeII emission and a\nhigher Eddington ratio that place them in the extreme upper right corner of the\n$R_{4570}$ - $\\xi_{Edd}$ diagram. The distribution of the radio-loudness\nparameter (R) in NLSy1 galaxies drops rapidly at R > 10 compared to the BLSy1\ngalaxies that have powerful radio jets. The soft X-ray photon index in NLSy1\ngalaxies is on average higher (2.9 $\\pm$ 0.9) than BLSy1 galaxies (2.4 $\\pm$\n0.8). It is anti-correlated with the H$\\beta$ width but correlated with the Fe\nII strength. NLSy1 galaxies on average have a lower amplitude of optical\nvariability compared to their broad lines counterparts. These results suggest\nEddington ratio as the main parameter that drives optical variability in these\nsources.\n", "  We discuss two threshold phenomena in blood coagulation dynamics using a\nsimplified model. This perspective of the underlying complex phenomena is\nexpected to aid the understanding and characterization of many blood\ncoagulation pathologies with altered protein dynamics.\n", "  In this article we present a detailed description of an electron in a uniform\nmagnetic field evolving under the Schr\\\"odinger equation using ladder\noperators. Based on this analysis, we describe the same physical system using\nthe Dirac equation, known from relativistic quantum mechanics. The main\ndifferences between these two quantum mechanical approaches are discussed and\nwe observe specifically how the relativistic phenomena modify the description\nof this particular quantum system.\n", "  We report on efforts to construct an event generator that calculates the\nclassical gluon field generated at early times in high energy nuclear\ncollisions. Existing approaches utilize numerical solutions of the Yang-Mills\nequations after the collision. In contrast we employ the analytically known\nrecursion relation in the forward light cone. The few lowest orders are\nexpected to lead to reliable results for times of up to the inverse saturation\nscale, tau_0 ~ 1/Q_s. In these proceedings we sketch some calculational\ndetails, and show some preliminary results.\n", "  Fundamental understanding of strongly-interacting systems necessarily\ninvolves collective modes, but their nature and evolution is not generally\nunderstood in dynamically disordered and strongly-interacting systems such as\nliquids and supercritical fluids. We report the results of extensive molecular\ndynamics simulations and provide direct evidence that liquids develop a gap in\nsolid-like transverse spectrum in the reciprocal space, with no propagating\nmodes between zero and a threshold value. In addition to the liquid state, this\nresult importantly applies to the supercritical state of matter. We show that\nthe emerging gap increases with the inverse of liquid relaxation time and\ndiscuss how the gap affects properties of liquid and supercritical states.\n", "  Semiconductor nanocrystals are a promising class of materials for a variety\nof novel optoelectronic devices, since many of their properties, such as the\nelectronic gap and conductivity, can be controlled. Much of this control is\nachieved via the organic ligand shell, through control of the size of the\nnanocrystal and the distance to other objects. We here simulate ligand-coated\nCdSe nanocrystals using atomistic molecular dynamics, allowing for the\nresolution of novel structural details about the ligand shell. We show that the\nligands on the surface can lie flat to form a highly anisotropic 'wet hair'\nlayer as opposed to the 'spiky ball' appearance typically considered. We\ndiscuss how this can give rise to a dot-to-dot packing distance of one ligand\nlength since the thickness of the ligand shell is reduced to approximately\none-half of the ligand length for the system sizes considered here; these\ndistances imply that energy and charge transfer rates between dots and nearby\nobjects will be enhanced due to the thinner than expected ligand shell. Our\nmodel predicts a non-linear scaling of ligand shell thickness as the ligands\ntransition from 'spiky' to 'wet hair'. We verify this scaling using TEM on a\nPbS nanoarray, confirming that this theory gives a qualitatively correct\npicture of the ligand shell thickness of colloidal quantum dots.\n", "  We solve Poisson's equation by combining a spectral-element method with a\nmapped infinite-element method. We focus on problems in geostatics and\ngeodynamics, where Earth's gravitational field is determined by Poisson's\nequation inside the Earth and Laplace's equation in the rest of space. Spectral\nelements are used to capture the internal field, and infinite elements are used\nto represent the external field. To solve the weak form of Poisson/Laplace\nequation, we use Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto quadrature in spectral elements inside\nthe domain of interest. Outside the domain, we use Gauss-Radau quadrature in\nthe infinite direction, and Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto quadrature in the other\ndirections. We illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the method by\ncomparing the gravitational fields of a homogeneous sphere and the Preliminary\nReference Earth Model (PREM) with (semi-)analytical solutions.\n", "  Freely suspended films of smectic liquid crystals are unique examples of\nquasi two-dimensional fluids. Mechanically stable and with quantized thickness\nof the order of only a few molecular layers, smectic films are ideal systems\nfor studying fundamental fluid physics, such as collective molecular ordering,\ndefect and fluctuation phenomena, hydrodynamics, and nonequilibrium behavior in\ntwo dimensions (2D), including serving as models of complex biological\nmembranes. Smectic films can be drawn across openings in planar supports\nresulting in thin, meniscus-bounded membranes, and can also be prepared as\nbubbles, either supported on an inflation tube or floating freely. The\nquantized layering renders smectic films uniquely useful in 2D fluid physics.\nThe OASIS team has pursued a variety of ground-based and microgravity\napplications of thin liquid crystal films to fluid structure and hydrodynamic\nproblems in 2D and quasi-2D systems. Parabolic flights and sounding rocket\nexperiments were carried out in order to explore the shape evolution of free\nfloating smectic bubbles, and to probe Marangoni effects in flat films. The\ndynamics of emulsions of smectic islands (thicker regions on thin background\nfilms) and of microdroplet inclusions in spherical films, as well as\nthermocapillary effects, were studied over extended periods within the OASIS\n(Observation and Analysis of Smectic Islands in Space) project on the\nInternational Space Station. We summarize the technical details of the OASIS\nhardware and give preliminary examples of key observations.\n", "  Autoignition experiments for n-butanol have been performed using a heated\nrapid compression machine at compressed pressures of 15 and 30 bar, in the\ncompressed temperature range of 675-925 K, and for equivalence ratios of 0.5,\n1.0, and 2.0. Over the conditions studied, the ignition delay decreases\nmonotonically as temperature increases, and the autoignition response exhibits\nsingle-stage characteristics. A non-linear fit to the experimental data is\nperformed and the reactivity, in terms of the inverse of ignition delay, shows\nnearly second order dependence on the initial oxygen mole fraction and slightly\ngreater than first order dependence on initial fuel mole fraction and\ncompressed pressure. Experimentally measured ignition delays are also compared\nto simulations using several reaction mechanisms available in the literature.\nAgreement between simulated and experimental ignition delay is found to be\nunsatisfactory. Sensitivity analysis is performed on one recent mechanism and\nindicates that uncertainties in the rate coefficients of parent fuel\ndecomposition reactions play a major role in causing the poor agreement. Path\nanalysis of the fuel decomposition reactions supports this conclusion and also\nhighlights the particular importance of certain pathways. Further experimental\ninvestigations of the fuel decomposition, including speciation measurements,\nare required.\n", "  We report on the broadband transient optical response from anisotropic\nnanobrick amorphous silicon particles, exhibiting Mie-type resonances. A\nquantitative model is developed to identify and disentangle the three physical\nprocesses that govern the ultrafast changes of the nanobrick optical\nproperties, namely two-photon absorption, free-carrier relaxation, and lattice\nheating. We reveal a set of operating windows where ultrafast all-optical\nmodulation of transmission is achieved with full return to zero in 20 ps. This\nis made possible due to the interplay between the competing nonlinear processes\nand despite the slow (nanosecond) internal lattice dynamics. The observed\nultrafast switching behavior can be independently engineered for both or-\nthogonal polarizations using the large anisotropy of nanobricks thus allowing\nultrafast anisotropy control. Our results categorically ascertain the potential\nof all-dielectric resonant nanophotonics as a platform for ultrafast optical\ndevices, and reveal the pos- sibility for ultrafast polarization-multiplexed\ndisplays and polarization rotators.\n", "  We extend the concept of shortcut to adiabaticity to full-wave optics and\nprovide application to the design of an ultra-compact waveguide junction. In\nparticular, we introduce a procedure allowing one to synthesize a purely\ndielectric optical potential that precisely compensates for the non-adiabatic\nlosses of the transverse-electric fundamental mode in any (sufficiently\nregular) two-dimensional waveguide junction. Our results are corroborated by\nfinite-element method numerical simulations in a Poschl-Teller waveguide mode\nexpander.\n", "  The authors of the paper, Limited surface mobility inhibits stable glass\nformation for 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, J. Chem. Phys. 146, 203317 (2017), encountered\ntwo problems in considering applicability of the Coupling Model. We show in\nthis Comment that these problems do not exist.\n", "  The Einstein's equivalence principle can be tested by using parameterized\npost-Newtonian parameters, of which the parameter $\\gamma$ has been constrained\nby comparing the arrival times of photons with different energies. It has been\nconstrained by a variety of astronomical transient events, such as gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs), fast radio bursts as well as pulses of pulsars, with the most\nstringent constraint of $\\Delta \\gamma \\lesssim 10^{-15}$. In this letter, we\nconsider the arrival times of lights with different circular polarization. For\na linearly polarized light, it is the combination of two circularly polarized\nlights. If the arrival time difference between the two circularly polarized\nlights is too large, their combination may lose the linear polarization. We\nconstrain the value of $\\Delta \\gamma_{\\rm p} < 1.6 \\times 10^{-27}$ by the\nmeasurement of the polarization of GRB 110721A, which is the most stringent\nconstraint ever achieved.\n", "  Discrete-time counterpart of thermodynamic uncertainty relation (conjectured\nin P. Pietzonka, et.al., arXiv:1702.07699 (2017)) with finite time interval is\nconsidered. We show that this relation do not hold by constructing a concrete\ncounterexample to this. Our finding suggests that the proof of thermodynamic\nuncertainty relation with finite time interval, if true, should strongly rely\non the fact that the time is continuous.\n", "  Within the framework of a multiphase transport model, we study the production\nand properties of $\\Omega$ and $\\phi$ in Au + Au collisions with a new set of\nparameters for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and with the original set of\nparameters for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 11.5 GeV, respectively. The AMPT model with\nthe string melting version provides a reasonable description at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$\n= 200 GeV and while the AMPT model with default version describes the data well\nat $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 11.5 GeV. It indicates that the system created at top RHIC\nenergy is dominated by partonic interaction and while the hadronic interaction\nbecomes important at lower beam energy, such as $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 11.5 GeV. The\ncomparison of $N(\\Omega ^++\\Omega^-)/[2N(\\phi)]$ ratio between data and\ncalculations further supports the argument. Our calculations can generally\ndescribe the data of nuclear modification factor as well as elliptic flow.\n", "  In this paper we calculate quantitative characteristics of basic geometric\nand kinematic properties of the Standard Cosmological Model ($\\Lambda$CDM).\nUsing equations of Friedman uniform cosmological models we derive equations\ncharacterizing a $\\Lambda$CDM, which describes the most appropriate real\nuniverse. The equations take into account the effects of radiation and\nultra-relativistic neutrinos. We show that the universe at very early and late\nstages can be described to sufficient accuracy by simple formulas. We derive\nmoments when densities of gravitational components of the universe become\nequal, when they contribute equally to the gravitational force, when the\naccelerating expansion of space starts, and several others. The distance to the\nexpanding spherical horizon and its acceleration are determined. Terms of the\nhorizon, second inflation, and second horizon are explained. The remote future\nof the universe and the opportunity in principle of connection with\nextraterrestrial civilizations are discussed.\n", "  Transient responses in disordered systems typically show a heavy-tail\nrelaxation behavior: the decay time constant increases as time increases,\nrevealing a spectral distribution of time constants. The asymptotic value of\nsuch transients is notoriously difficult to experimentally measure due to the\nincreasing decay time-scale. However, if the heavy-tail transient is plotted\nversus log-time, a reduced set of data around the inflection point of such a\nplot is sufficient for an accurate fit. From a derivative plot in log-time, the\npeak height, position, line width, and, most importantly, skewness are all that\nis needed to accurately predict the asymptotic value of various heavy-tail\ndecay models to within less than a percent. This curve fitting strategy reduces\nby orders of magnitude the amount of experimental data required, and clearly\nidentifies a threshold below which the amount of data is insufficient to\ndistinguish various models. The skew normal spectral fit and dispersive\ndiffusion transient fit are proposed as four-parameter fits, with the latter\nincluding the stretched exponential as a limiting case. The line fit and\nasymptotic prediction are demonstrated using experimental transient responses\nin previously published amorphous silicon and amorphous InGaZnO data.\n", "  We report the magnetic and dielectric behavior of Pb6Ni9(TeO6)5, a new\ncompound comprising the honeycomb-like layers of S=1 spins, through detailed\nstructural, magnetic and dielectric investigation. An antiferromagnetic-type\ntransition at 25 K (TN) with weak-ferromagnetic behavior is revealed.\nInterestingly, a large value of coercive field of 1.32 T at 2 K is observed.\nThe isothermal magnetization after zero-field-cooled condition, it exhibits the\npresence of large spontaneous exchange bias (SEB) with a magnitude of 0.19 T at\n2 K; which is rare in single bulk materials, especially without external\ndoping. The value of |HEB| further enhances to 0.24 T under 16 T field-cooled\ncondition, confirming the presence of large exchange bias in the material. In\naddition, the dielectric constant shows an anomaly at the onset of TN,\nindicating the presence of magnetodielectric coupling.\n", "  In order to investigate the relation between the bulk plastic compression\nbehavior and the evolution of grain size distribution (GSD) due to grain\ncrushing under high-pressure compression and shear, we performed three types of\nloading experiments; single grain crushing (SGC) test, one-dimensional\ncompression (ODC) test and rotary shear (RS) tests. The materials used are an\nangular mountain silica sand and a round river silica sand. The major findings\nare summarized as follows: (1) The SGC tests reveal that the Weibull model is\nsuccessfully applied with the modulus m=2 for single grain crushing stress. (2)\nIn the ODC tests, the relation between the applied pressure, p, and the\nresulting porosity, n, fits better on a bi-linear model in a log n - log p plot\nthan in the classical e-log p plot, where e is the void ratio. (3) Both in the\nODC and the RS tests, the GSD converges into a power-law (fractal) distribution\nwith the exponent (fractal dimension) of about -2.5, which is close to the one\nfor Apollonian sphere packing, -2.47 (Borkovec et al., 1994). (4) The proposed\nrecursive pore filling model successfully describes the log n - log p relation\nin the ODC test and log n - log relation, where is the shear strain, in the RS\ntest in a consistent manner.\n", "  In this paper, the work function of graphene doped by different metal adatoms\nand at different concentrations is investigated. Density functional theory is\nused to maximize the reduction of the work function. In general, the work\nfunction drops significantly before reaching saturation. For example in the\ncase of Cs doping, the work function saturates at 2.05 eV with a modest 8 %\ndoping. The adsorption of different concentrations on metal adatoms on graphene\nis also studied. Our calculations show that the adatoms prefer to relax at\nhollow sites. The transfer of electron from metallic dopants to the graphene\nfor all the studied systems shifts the Fermi energy levels above the\nDirac-point and the doped graphenes become metallic. The value of Fermi energy\nshifts depends on the type of metallic dopants and its concentrations. A detail\nanalysis of the electronic structure in terms of band structure and density of\nstates, absorption energy, and charge transfer for each adatom-graphene system\nis presented.\n", "  LHCb found hints for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) in $B\\to\nK^*\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $R(K)$ and $B_s\\to\\phi\\mu^+\\mu^-$. These intriguing hints for\nNP have recently been confirmed by the LHCb measurement of $R(K^*)$ giving a\ncombined significance for NP above the $5\\,\\sigma$ level. In addition, the\nBABAR, BELLE and LHCb results for $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ also point towards\nlepton flavour universality (LFU) violating new physics (NP). Furthermore,\nthere is the long-standing discrepancy between the measurement and the theory\nprediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($a_\\mu$) at the\n$3\\,\\sigma$ level. Concerning NP effects, $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ data can be\nnaturally explained with a new neutral gauge bosons, i.e. a $Z^\\prime$ but also\nwith heavy new scalars and fermions contributing via box diagrams. Another\npromising solution to $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$, which can also explain $B\\to\nD^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$, are leptoquarks. Interestingly, leptoquarks provide also a\nviable explanation of $a_\\mu$ which can be tested via correlated effects in\n$Z\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ at future colliders. Considering leptoquark models, we show\nthat an explanation of $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ predicts an enhancement of $b\\to\ns\\tau^+\\tau^-$ processes by around three orders of magnitude compared to the\nSM. In case of a simultaneous explanation of $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ and $b\\to\ns\\mu^+\\mu^-$ data, sizable effects in $b\\to s\\tau\\mu$ processes are predicted.\n", "  Photon-number measurements are a fundamental technique for the discrimination\nand characterization of quantum states of light. Beyond the abilities of\nstate-of-the-art devices, we present measurements with an array of 100\navalanche photodiodes exposed to photon-numbers ranging from well below to\nsignificantly above one photon per diode. Despite each single diode only\ndiscriminating between zero and non-zero photon-numbers we are able to extract\ncharacteristic information about the quantum state. We demonstrate a vast\nenhancement of the applicable intensity range by two orders of magnitude\nrelative to the standard application of such devices. It turns out that the\nprobabilistic mapping of arbitrary photon-numbers on a finite number of\nregistered clicks is not per se a disadvantage compared with true photon\ncounters. Such detector arrays can bridge the gap between single-photon and\nlinear detection, by directly using the recorded data, without the need of\nelaborate data reconstruction methods.\n", "  In high-energy particle physics, workflow management systems are primarily\nused as tailored solutions in dedicated areas such as Monte Carlo production.\nHowever, physicists performing data analyses are usually required to steer\ntheir individual workflows manually which is time-consuming and often leads to\nundocumented relations between particular workloads. We present a generic\nanalysis design pattern that copes with the sophisticated demands of end-to-end\nHEP analyses and provides a make-like execution system. It is based on the\nopen-source pipelining package Luigi which was developed at Spotify and enables\nthe definition of arbitrary workloads, so-called Tasks, and the dependencies\nbetween them in a lightweight and scalable structure. Further features are\nmulti-user support, automated dependency resolution and error handling, central\nscheduling, and status visualization in the web. In addition to already\nbuilt-in features for remote jobs and file systems like Hadoop and HDFS, we\nadded support for WLCG infrastructure such as LSF and CREAM job submission, as\nwell as remote file access through the Grid File Access Library. Furthermore,\nwe implemented automated resubmission functionality, software sandboxing, and a\ncommand line interface with auto-completion for a convenient working\nenvironment. For the implementation of a $t\\bar{t}H$ cross section measurement,\nwe created a generic Python interface that provides programmatic access to all\nexternal information such as datasets, physics processes, statistical models,\nand additional files and values. In summary, the setup enables the execution of\nthe entire analysis in a parallelized and distributed fashion with a single\ncommand.\n", "  The term `history effect' refers to the contribution of any past mass\ntransfer events between a gas bubble and its liquid surroundings towards the\ncurrent diffusion-driven growth or dissolution dynamics of that same bubble.\nThe history effect arises from the (non-instantaneous) development of the\ndissolved gas concentration boundary layer in the liquid in response to changes\nin the concentration at the bubble interface caused, for instance, by\nvariations of the ambient pressure in time. Essentially, the history effect\namounts to the acknowledgement that at any given time the mass flux across the\nbubble is conditioned by the preceding time-history of the concentration at the\nbubble boundary. Considering the canonical problem of an isolated spherical\nbubble at rest, we show that the contribution of the history effect in the\ncurrent interfacial concentration gradient is fully contained within a memory\nintegral of the interface concentration. Retaining this integral term, we\nformulate a governing differential equation for the bubble dynamics, analogous\nto the well-known Epstein-Plesset solution. Our equation does not make use of\nthe quasi-static radius approximation. An analytical solution is presented for\nthe case of multiple step-like jumps in pressure. The nature and relevance of\nthe history effect is then assessed through illustrative examples. Finally, we\ninvestigate the role of the history effect in rectified diffusion for a bubble\nthat pulsates under harmonic pressure forcing in the non-inertial, isothermal\nregime.\n", "  The accurate description of the growth or dissolution dynamics of a soluble\ngas bubble in a super- or undersaturated solution requires taking into account\na number of physical effects that contribute to the instantaneous mass transfer\nrate. One of these effects is the so-called history effect. It refers to the\ncontribution of the local concentration boundary layer around the bubble that\nhas developed from past mass transfer events between the bubble and liquid\nsurroundings. In Part 1 of this work \\citep{penas2016}, a theoretical treatment\nof this effect was given for a spherical, isolated bubble. Here, Part 2\nprovides an experimental and numerical study of the history effect regarding a\nspherical bubble attached to a horizontal flat plate and in the presence of\ngravity. The simulation technique developed in this paper is based on a\nstreamfunction--vorticity formulation that may be applied to other flows where\nbubbles or drops exchange mass in the presence of a gravity field. Using this\nnumerical tool, simulations are performed for the same conditions used in the\nexperiments, in which the bubble is exposed to subsequent growth and\ndissolution stages, using step-wise variations in the ambient pressure. Besides\nproving the relevance of the history effect, the simulations highlight the\nimportance that boundary-induced advection has to accurately describe bubble\ngrowth and shrinkage, i.e. the bubble radius evolution. In addition, natural\nconvection has a significant influence that shows up in the velocity field even\nat short times, though, given the supersaturation conditions studied here, the\nbubble evolution is expected to be mainly diffusive.\n", "  Solar flares with a broadband emission in the white-light range of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum belong to most enigmatic phenomena on the Sun. The\norigin of the white-light emission is not entirely understood. We aim to\nsystematically study the visible-light emission connected to solar flares in\nSDO/HMI observations. We developed a code for automatic detection of kernels of\nflares with HMI intensity brightenings and study properties of detected\ncandidates. The code was tuned and tested and with a little effort, it could be\napplied to any suitable data set. By studying a few flare examples, we found\nindication that HMI intensity brightening might be an artefact of the\nsimplified procedure used to compute HMI observables.\n", "  We consider the Burgers equation posed on the outer communication region of a\nSchwarzschild black hole spacetime. Assuming spherical symmetry for the fluid\nflow under consideration, we study the propagation and interaction of shock\nwaves under the effect of random forcing. First of all, considering the initial\nand boundary value problem with boundary data prescribed in the vicinity of the\nhorizon, we establish a generalization of the Hopf--Lax--Oleinik formula, which\ntakes the curved geometry into account and allows us to establish the existence\nof bounded variation solutions. To this end, we analyze the global behavior of\nthe characteristic curves in the Schwarzschild geometry, including their\nbehavior near the black hole horizon. In a second part, we investigate the\nlong-term statistical properties of solutions when a random forcing is imposed\nnear the black hole horizon and study the ergodicity of the fluid flow under\nconsideration. We prove the existence of a random global attractor and, for the\nBurgers equation outside of a Schwarzschild black hole, we are able to validate\nthe so-called `one-force-one-solution' principle. Furthermore, all of our\nresults are also established for a pressureless Euler model which consists of\ntwo balance laws and includes a transport equation satisfied by the integrated\nfluid density.\n", "  We provide one theorem of spectral equivalence of Koopman operators of an\noriginal dynamical system and its reconstructed one through the delay-embedding\ntechnique. The theorem is proved for measure-preserving maps (e.g. dynamics on\ncompact attractors) and provides a mathematical foundation of computing\nspectral properties of the Koopman operators by a combination of extended\ndynamic mode decomposition and delay-embedding.\n", "  Proton capture reaction is an important process concerning the astrophysical\norigin of the elements. In present work, we focus on giant dipole resonance\n(GDR) in proton capture reactions, such as $^{11}$B$(p, \\gamma)^{12}$C,\n$^{27}$Al$(p, \\gamma)^{28}$Si, $^{39}$K$(p, \\gamma)^{40}$Ca, and $^{67}$Co$(p,\n\\gamma)^{68}$Ni in a framework of an extended quantum molecular dynamics model.\nThe systematic properties of GDR parameters including the peak energy, the\nstrength and full width at half maximum (FWHM) have been studied. The\ndependence of FWHM on temperature has also been discussed. Some comparisons\nwith experimental data have been presented.\n", "  Belle II is an upcoming experiment at the next generation SuperKEKB e+e-\ncollider. It will record about 50 ab-1 of data mostly at the Y(4S) resonance.\nThe high statistics will allow precision measurements for rare decays, which\ncan be then compared with the Standard Model predictions in order to search\nindirectly for new physics. We present the prospects for rare decay studies at\nBelle II.\n", "  The study of mesons and baryons which contain at least one charm quark is\nreferred to as open charm physics. It offers the possibility to study up-type\nquark transitions. Since the $c$ quark can not be treated in any mass limit,\ntheoretical predictions are difficult and experimental input is crucial. BESIII\ncollected large data samples of $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at several charm\nthresholds. The at-threshold decay topology offers special opportunities to\nstudy open charm decays. We present a selection of recent BESIII results.\nBranching fractions and the $D_{s}^{+}$ decay constant are measured using the\nleptonic decays to $\\mu^{+}\\nu$ and $\\tau^{+}\\nu$. From a data sample of $0.482\nfb^{-1}$ collected at the $D_{s}^{+}D_{s}^{-}$ threshold we measure\n$f_{Ds}=(241 \\pm 16.3(stat.) \\pm 6.6(sys.)) MeV$. BESIII recently found\npreliminary evidence of the decay $D_{s}^{+}\\rightarrow\\tau^{+}\\nu$ and with a\nsignificance larger than $4 \\sigma$ using $2.81 fb^{-1}$ of data at the\n$D^0\\overline{D^0}$ threshold. Using the same data sample the decay\n$D^0\\rightarrow K^0_{S/L} \\pi^0(\\pi^0)$ is analysed. The branching fractions\nare measured and using the $CP$ eigenstates $K_{S/L}^0\\pi^0$ the $D^0$ mixing\nparameter $y_{CP} = (0.98 \\pm 2.43)\\%$ is measured.\n", "  The spherical-harmonics expansion is a mathematically rigorous procedure and\na powerful tool for the representation of potential energy surfaces of\ninteracting molecular systems, determining their spectroscopic and dynamical\nproperties, specifically in van der Waals clusters, with applications also to\nclassical and quantum molecular dynamics simulations. The technique consists in\nthe construction (by ab initio or semiempirical methods) of the expanded\npotential interaction up to terms that provide the generation of a number of\nleading configurations sufficient to account for faithful geometrical\nrepresentations. This paper reports the full general description of the method\nof the spherical-harmonics expansion as applied to\ndiatomic-molecule-diatomic-molecule systems of increasing complexity: the\npresentation of the mathematical background is given for providing both the\napplication to the prototypical cases considered previously (O2-O2, N2-N2, and\nN2-O2 systems) and the generalization to: (i) the CO-CO system, where a\ncharacteristic feature is the lower symmetry order with respect to the cases\nstudied before, requiring a larger number of expansion terms necessary to\nadequately represent the potential energy surface; and (ii) the CO-HF system,\nwhich exhibits the lowest order of symmetry among this class of aggregates and\ntherefore the highest number of leading configurations.\n", "  Cabello et al. claim to have proven the existence of an empirically\nverifiable difference between two broad classes of quantum interpretations. On\nthe basis of three seemingly uncontentious assumptions, (i) the possibility of\nrandomly selected measurements, (ii) the finiteness of a quantum system's\nmemory, and (iii) the validity of Landauer's principle, and further, by\napplying computational mechanics to quantum processes, the authors arrive at\nthe conclusion that some quantum interpretations (including central realist\ninterpretations) are associated with an excess heat cost and are thereby\nuntenable - or at least - that they can be distinguished empirically from their\ncompetitors by measuring the heat produced. Here, we provide an explicit\ncounterexample to this claim and demonstrate that their surprising result can\nbe traced back to a lack of distinction between system and external agent. By\ndrawing the distinction carefully, we show that the resulting heat cost is\nfully accounted for in the external agent, thereby restoring the tenability of\nthe quantum interpretations in question.\n", "  Recent work has considered theoretical models for the behavior of agents with\nspecific behavioral biases: rather than making decisions that optimize a given\npayoff function, the agent behaves inefficiently because its decisions suffer\nfrom an underlying bias. These approaches have generally considered an agent\nwho experiences a single behavioral bias, studying the effect of this bias on\nthe outcome.\n  In general, however, decision-making can and will be affected by multiple\nbiases operating at the same time. How do multiple biases interact to produce\nthe overall outcome? Here we consider decisions in the presence of a pair of\nbiases exhibiting an intuitively natural interaction: present bias -- the\ntendency to value costs incurred in the present too highly -- and sunk-cost\nbias -- the tendency to incorporate costs experienced in the past into one's\nplans for the future.\n  We propose a theoretical model for planning with this pair of biases, and we\nshow how certain natural behavioral phenomena can arise in our model only when\nagents exhibit both biases. As part of our model we differentiate between\nagents that are aware of their biases (sophisticated) and agents that are\nunaware of them (naive). Interestingly, we show that the interaction between\nthe two biases is quite complex: in some cases, they mitigate each other's\neffects while in other cases they might amplify each other. We obtain a number\nof further results as well, including the fact that the planning problem in our\nmodel for an agent experiencing and aware of both biases is computationally\nhard in general, though tractable under more relaxed assumptions.\n", "  We have imaged N\\'eel skyrmion bubbles in perpendicularly magnetised\npolycrystalline multilayers patterned into 1 \\mu m diameter dots, using\nscanning transmission x-ray microscopy. The skyrmion bubbles can be nucleated\nby the application of an external magnetic field and are stable at zero field\nwith a diameter of 260 nm. Applying an out of plane field that opposes the\nmagnetisation of the skyrmion bubble core moment applies pressure to the bubble\nand gradually compresses it to a diameter of approximately 100 nm. On removing\nthe field the skyrmion bubble returns to its original diameter via a hysteretic\npathway where most of the expansion occurs in a single abrupt step. This\ncontradicts analytical models of homogeneous materials in which the skyrmion\ncompression and expansion are reversible. Micromagnetic simulations\nincorporating disorder can explain this behaviour using an effective thickness\nmodulation between 10 nm grains.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of intergalactic metal absorption lines\nimprinted in the spectra of distant quasars during and after the Epoch of\nReionization (EoR). We use high resolution hydrodynamical simulations at high\nredshift ($4 <z<8$), assuming a uniform UV background Haardt--Madau 12,\npost-processing with CLOUDY photoionization models and Voigt profile fitting to\naccurately calculate column densities of the ions CII, CIV, SiII, SiIV and OI\nin the intergalactic medium (IGM). In addition, we generate mock observations\nof neutral Hydrogen (HI) at $z<6$. Our simulations successfully reproduce the\nevolution of the cosmological mass density ($\\Omega$) of CII and CIV, with\n$\\Omega_{CII}$ exceeding $\\Omega_{CIV}$ at $z >6$, consistent with the current\npicture of the tail of the EoR. The simulated CII exhibits a bimodal\ndistribution with large absorptions in and around galaxies, and some traces in\nthe lower density IGM. We find some discrepancies between the observed and\nsimulated column density relationships among different ionic species at $z=6$,\nprobably due to uncertainties in the assumed UV background. Finally, our\nsimulations are in good agreement with observations of the HI column density\ndistribution function at $z = 4$ and the HI cosmological mass density\n$\\Omega_{HI}$ at $4 < z < 6$.\n", "  New photometric data from CCD UBVRI observations of the PMS star V350 Cep\nduring the period from March 2014 to May 2017 are presented. In the period\nApril-May 2016 we registered a deep fades event in the brightness of the star\nwith amplitudes $\\Delta I$ = 1.75 mag, $\\Delta R$ = 1.69 mag, $\\Delta V$ = 1.77\nmag and $\\Delta B$ = 2.16 mag. Simultaneously with the fades in the brightness,\nthe change in the star's color indices has been observed. V350 Cep indicates\nthe typical for stars of UXor type \"blueing effect\" during the deep minimum of\nbrightness. During the second half of 2016 V350 Cep restores its brightness to\na level close to the maximum. Since the star has been studied as a possible\nFUor object in previous studies, the possible cause of the deep decline is a\ndecrease in the accretion rate. Another possible cause is obscuration from\nclumps of dust orbiting at the vicinity of the star.\n", "  Quantum chromodynamics, most commonly referred to as QCD, is a relativistic\nquantum field theory for the strong interaction between subatomic particles\ncalled quarks and gluons. The most systematic way of calculating the strong\ninteractions of QCD is a computational approach known as lattice gauge theory\nor lattice QCD. Space-time is discretised so that field variables are\nformulated on the sites and links of a four dimensional hypercubic lattice.\nThis technique enables the gluon field to be represented using $3 \\times 3$\ncomplex matrices in four space-time dimensions. Importance sampling techniques\ncan then be exploited to calculate physics observables as functions of the\nfields, averaged over a statistically-generated and suitably weighted ensemble\nof field configurations. In this paper we present a framework developed to\nvisually assist scientists in the analysis of multidimensional properties and\nemerging phenomena within QCD ensemble simulations. Core to the framework is\nthe use of topology-driven visualisation techniques which enable the user to\nsegment the data into unique objects, calculate properties of individual\nobjects present on the lattice, and validate features detected using\nstatistical measures. The framework enables holistic analysis to validate\nexisting hypothesis against novel visual cues with the intent of supporting and\nsteering scientists in the analysis and decision making process. Use of the\nframework has lead to new studies into the effect that variation of\nthermodynamic control parameters has on the topological structure of lattice\nfields.\n", "  Unlike traditional fiber laser with defined resonant cavity, random fiber\nlaser (RFL), whose operation is based on distributed gain and feedback via\nRayleigh scattering and stimulated Raman scattering in long passive fiber, has\nfundamental scientific challenges in pulsing operation for its remarkable\ncavity-free feature. Here, we propose and experimentally realize the passively\nspatiotemporal gain modulation induced self-started stable pulsing operation of\ncounter-pumped RFL. Thanks to the good temporal stability of employed pumping\namplified spontaneous emission source and the superiority of this pulse\ngeneration scheme, stable and regular pulse train can be obtained. Furthermore,\nthe pump hysteresis and bistability phenomena with the generation of high order\nStokes light is presented and the dynamics of pulsing operation is discussed.\nThis work extends our comprehension of temporal property of RFL and provides an\neffective novel avenue for the exploration of pulsed RFL with structural\nsimplicity, low cost and stable output.\n", "  Carbon nanotube quantum dots allow accurate control of electron charge, spin\nand valley degrees of freedom in a material which is atomically perfect and can\nbe grown isotopically pure. These properties underlie the unique potential of\ncarbon nanotubes for quantum information processing, but developing nanotube\ncharge, spin, or spin-valley qubits requires efficient readout techniques as\nwell as understanding and extending quantum coherence in these devices. Here,\nwe report on microwave spectroscopy of a carbon nanotube charge qubit in which\nquantum information is encoded in the spatial position of an electron. We\ncombine radio-frequency reflectometry measurements of the quantum capacitance\nof the device with microwave manipulation to drive transitions between the\nqubit states. This approach simplifies charge-state readout and allows us to\noperate the device at an optimal point where the qubit is first-order\ninsensitive to charge noise. From these measurements, we are able to quantify\nthe degree of charge noise experienced by the qubit and obtain an inhomogeneous\ncharge coherence of 5 ns. We use a chopped microwave signal whose duty-cycle\nperiod is varied to measure the decay of the qubit states, yielding a charge\nrelaxation time of 48 ns.\n", "  A recently developed multiphase field model (Bair et al. Acta Materialia\n2017) is used to study the effects of applied strain and metastable zeta and\ngamma hydrides on the formation and growth of the stable delta hydrides in\nalpha-zirconium matrix. A two-dimensional domain is considered where x-axis\n(hoop or circumferential direction) is in [11-20] direction and y-axis (radial\ndirection) is in [0001] direction. Single seed simulations indicate that the\nintermediate phases are critical in the formation and evolution of delta phase\nhydrides. Hydride reorientation occurs when a tensile strain of 0.021 is\napplied in the [11-20] direction or a compressive strain of 0.018 is applied in\nthe [0001] direction. Shear strain is shown to significantly reorient zeta\nphase hydrides before other phases of hydrides form and reorient the hydride\nagain near the unstressed growth direction. Simulations of two seeds aligned in\nthe [0001] direction indicate a significant influence of neighboring\nprecipitates on the applied strain required for reorientation, reducing it to\n0.0002 for both cases of tension in [11-20] direction and compression in [0001]\ndirection when the seeds are about 15 nm from each other.\n", "  Massive neutrinos have nonzero magnetic moments. It is known that the\nneutrino spin oscillations can be induced by the neutrino magnetic moment\ninteraction with the transversal magnetic field. We perform a regions\nderivation of the effective neutrino evolution Hamiltonian in moving matter and\nshow that spin oscillations can be engendered by the interaction with the\ntransversal current of matter. The obtained general expression for the neutrino\neffective evolution Hamiltonian can be used for investigations of various types\nof neutrino spin oscillations in the transversal matter currents considered in\nthe neutrino mass and flavour basis.\n", "  Quantum memories are key components in quantum information networks. Their\nability to store and retrieve information on demand makes repeat-until-success\nstrategies scalable. Warm alkali-metal vapours are interesting candidates for\nthe implementation of such memories, thanks to their long storage times and\nexperimental simplicity. Operation with the Raman protocol enables high\ntime-bandwidth products, which allows for multiple synchronisation trials of\nprobabilistically operating quantum gates via memory-based temporal\nmultiplexing. This makes the Raman memory a promising tool, whose broad\nspectral bandwidth facilitates direct interfacing with other photonic\nprimitives, such as single photon sources. Here, such a light-matter interface\nis implemented in a warm caesium vapour. Firstly, we study the storage of\npolarisation-encoded information in the memory. High quality polarisation\npreservation for bright coherent state input signals can be achieved, when\noperating the Raman memory in a dual-rail configuration inside a polarisation\ninterferometer. Secondly, heralded single photons are stored in the memory. To\nthis end, the memory is operated on-demand by feed-forward of source heralding\nevents, which is a key technological capability. Prior to storage, single\nphotons are produced in a spontaneous parametric down conversion source, whose\nbespoke design spectrally tailors the photons to the memory acceptance line.\nThe faithful retrieval of stored single photons is found to be currently\nlimited by noise in the memory, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.3 in the\nmemory output. Nevertheless, a clear influence of the input's quantum nature is\nobserved in the retrieved light by measuring signal's photon statistics.\nFinally, the memory noise processes are examined in detail. Four-wave-mixing\nnoise is determined as the sole important noise source for the Raman memory.\n", "  We consider the vector generalization of the modified Korteweg-de Vries\nequation. We develop the inverse scattering transform for solving this\nequation. We construct the solitons and the breather solutions and investigate\nthe processes of their collisions. We show that along with one-component\nsoliton solutions, there are solutions which have essentially three-component\nstructure.\n", "  The Lieb Lattice exhibits intriguing properties that are of general interest\nin both the fundamental physics and practical applications. Here, we\ninvestigate the topological Landau-Zener Bloch oscillation in a photonic\nFloquet Lieb lattice, where the dimerized helical waveguides is constructed to\nrealize the synthetic spin-orbital interaction through the Floquet mechanism,\nrendering us to study the impacts of topological transition from trivial gaps\nto non-trivial ones. The compact localized states of flat bands supported by\nthe local symmetry of Lieb lattice will be associated with other bands by\ntopological invariants, Chern number, and involved into Landau-Zener transition\nduring Bloch oscillation. Importantly, the non-trivial geometrical phases after\ntopological transitions will be taken into account for constructive and\ndestructive interferences of wave functions. The numerical calculations of\ncontinuum photonic medium demonstrate reasonable agreements with theoretical\ntight-binding model. Our results provide an ongoing effort to realize designed\nquantum materials with tailored properties.\n", "  Autocorrelation is a common method to estimate the duration of ultra-short\nlaser pulses. In the ultra-violet (UV) regime it is increasingly challenging to\nemploy the standard process of second harmonic generation, most prominently due\nto absorption in nonlinear crystals at very short wavelengths. Here we show how\nto utilize spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) to generate an\nautocorrelation signal for UV pulses in the infrared. Our method utilizes the\n$n^{\\text{th}}$ order emission of the SPDC process, which occurs for low\npumping powers proportional to the $n^{\\text{th}}$ power of the UV intensity.\nThus, counting $2n$ down-converted photons directly yields the\n$n^{\\text{th}}$-order autocorrelation. The method, now with detection of near\ninfrared photons with high efficiency, is applied here to the first direct\nmeasurement of ultra-short UV-pulses (approximately $176\\, \\text{fs}$, center\nwavelength $390\\, \\text{nm}$) inside a UV enhancement cavity.\n", "  Collective cell migration underlies important biological processes, such as\nembryonic development, wound healing and cancer invasion. While many aspects of\nsingle cell movements are now well established, the mechanisms leading to\ndisplacements of cohesive cell groups are still poorly understood. To elucidate\nthe emergence of collective migration in mechanosensitive cells, we examine a\nself-propelled Voronoi (SPV) model of confluent tissues with an orientational\nfeedback that aligns a cell's polarization with its local migration velocity.\nWhile shape and motility are known to regulate a density-independent\nliquid-solid transition in tissues, we find that aligning interactions\nfacilitate collective motion and promote solidification. Our model reproduces\nthe behavior observed in jammed epithelial monolayers, which are unjammed by\nthe addition of the endocytic protein RAB5A that promotes cell motility by\ninducing large scale coherent migratory patterns and local fluidization.\n", "  We report on all- to- all chaos synchronization in a network of networks\nbased on the Ikeda model. We consider one of the simplest cases. We find the\nexistence and stability conditions for such a synchronization regime. Numerical\nsimulations validate the analytical findings. The results can be of certain\nimportance in achieving high level output for the coupled systems and\ninformation processing.\n", "  In this thesis, I study the expected direct and indirect detection signals of\ndark matter. More precisely, I study three aspects of dark matter; I use\nhydrodynamic simulations to extract properties of weakly interacting dark\nmatter that are relevant for both direct and indirect detection signals, and\nconstruct viable dark matter models with interesting experimental signatures.\nFirst, I analyze the full scale Illustris simulation, and find that Galactic\nindirect detection signals are expected to be largely symmetric, while\nextragalactic signals are not, due to recent mergers and the presence of\nsubstructure. Second, through the study of the high resolution Milky Way\nsimulation Eris, I find that metal-poor halo stars can be used as tracers for\nthe dark matter velocity distribution. I use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to\nobtain the first empirical velocity distribution of dark matter, which weakens\nthe expected direct detection limits by up to an order of magnitude at masses\n$\\lesssim 10$ GeV. Finally, I expand the weakly interacting dark matter\nparadigm by proposing a new dark matter model called boosted dark matter. This\nnovel scenario contains a relativistic component with interesting hybrid direct\nand indirect detection signatures at neutrino experiments. I propose two search\nstrategies for boosted dark matter, at Cherenkov-based experiments and future\nliquid-argon neutrino detectors.\n", "  Many social and economic systems are naturally represented as networks, from\noff-line and on-line social networks, to bipartite networks, like Netflix and\nAmazon, between consumers and products. Graphons, developed as limits of\ngraphs, form a natural, nonparametric method to describe and estimate large\nnetworks like Facebook and LinkedIn. Here we describe the development of the\ntheory of graphons, for both dense and sparse networks, over the last decade.\nWe also review theorems showing that we can consistently estimate graphons from\nmassive networks in a wide variety of models. Finally, we show how to use\ngraphons to estimate missing links in a sparse network, which has applications\nfrom estimating social and information networks in development economics, to\nrigorously and efficiently doing collaborative filtering with applications to\nmovie recommendations in Netflix and product suggestions in Amazon.\n", "  Searching for new functionality in next generation electronic devices is a\nprincipal driver of material physics research. Multiferroics simultaneously\nexhibit electric and magnetic order parameters that may be coupled through\nmagnetoelectric (ME) effects. In single-phase materials the ME effect arises\nfrom one of three known mechanisms: inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (IDM)\ninteraction, spin dependent ligand-metal (p-d) orbital hybridization, and\nexchange striction. However, the coupling among these mechanisms remains\nlargely unexplored despite envisioned potential capabilities. Here, we present\ncooperative tuning between both IDM interaction and p-d hybridization that\nleads to discrete ME states in Ba0.5Sr2.5Co2Fe24O41. In-situ x-ray diffraction\nexposes the microscopic interplay between these two mechanisms, marked by a\nunique ME susceptibility upon electric and magnetic fields. The entangled\nmulti-ME coupling phenomenon observed in this room-temperature ME hexaferrite\noffers a pathway to novel functional control for ME device applications.\n", "  The characterization of irreversibility in general quantum processes is an\nopen problem of increasing techno- logical relevance. Yet, the tools currently\navailable to this aim are mostly limited to the assessment of dynamics induced\nby equilibrium environments, a situation that often does not match the reality\nof experiments at the microscopic and mesoscopic scale. We propose a theory of\nirreversible entropy production that is suited for quantum systems exposed to\ngeneral, non-equilibrium reservoirs. We illustrate our framework by addressing\na set of physically relevant situations that clarify both the features and the\npotential of our proposal.\n", "  The flow of quantum information in local dephasing channels is analyzed over\nshort and long times in case the structured reservoirs of frequency modes\nexhibit a spectral gap in the density of modes over low frequencies. The\npresence of the low-frequency gap with upper cut-off frequency $\\omega_g$\nproduces over the time scale $1/\\omega_g$ an infinite sequence of time\nintervals over which information backflow appears. Such time intervals are\ngenerally irregular but, under certain conditions, exhibit the following\nbounds: the $n$th backflow has certainly started at the instant $\\pi\n\\left(1+2(n-1)\\right)/\\omega_g$, and certainly ended at the instant $2\\pi\nn/\\omega_g$, for every $n=1,2,\\ldots$. The intervals become regular over long\ntimes, tend to the asymptotic length $\\pi/\\omega_g$ as supremum value, and are\ndescribed analytically in terms of the structure of the spectral density near\nthe cut-off frequency. Consequently, engineering structured reservoirs of\nfrequency modes with low-frequency spectral gaps produces in local dephasing\nchannels regular and controllable sequences of information backflow and\nrecoherence over long times, along with non-Markovian evolution.\n", "  The possibility of realizing non-Abelian excitations (non-Abelions) in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) Abelian states of matter has generated a lot of interest\nrecently. A well-known example of such non-Abelions are parafermion zeros modes\n(PFZMs) which can be realized at the endpoints of the so called genons in\nfractional quantum Hall (FQH) states or fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). In\nthis letter, we discuss some known signatures of PFZMs and also introduce some\nnovel ones. In particular, we show that the topological entanglement entropy\n(TEE) shifts by a quantized value after crossing PFZMs. Utilizing those\nsignatures, we present the first large scale numerical study of PFZMs and their\nstability against perturbations in both FQH states and FCIs within the\ndensity-Matrix-Renormalization-Group (DMRG) framework. Our results can help\nbuild a closer connection with future experiments on FQH states with genons.\n", "  The point sources in the Bright Source Catalogue of the AKARI Far-Infrared\nSurveyor (FIS) were classified based on their FIR and mid-IR fluxes and colours\ninto young stellar object (YSO) and extragalactic source types using Quadratic\nDiscriminant Analysis method (QDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The\nreliability of the selection of YSO candidates is high, and the number of known\nYSO candidates were increased significantly, that we demonstrate in the case of\nthe nearby open cluster IC348. Our results show that we can separate galactic\nand extragalactic AKARI point sources in the multidimensional space of FIR\nfluxes and colours with high reliability, however, differentiating among the\nextragalactic sub-types needs further information.\n", "  Debris discs are evidence of the ongoing destructive collisions between\nplanetesimals, and their presence around stars also suggests that planets exist\nin these systems. In this paper, we present submillimetre images of the thermal\nemission from debris discs that formed the SCUBA-2 Observations of Nearby Stars\n(SONS) survey, one of seven legacy surveys undertaken on the James Clerk\nMaxwell telescope between 2012 and 2015. The overall results of the survey are\npresented in the form of 850 microns (and 450 microns, where possible) images\nand fluxes for the observed fields. Excess thermal emission, over that expected\nfrom the stellar photosphere, is detected around 49 stars out of the 100\nobserved fields. The discs are characterised in terms of their flux density,\nsize (radial distribution of the dust) and derived dust properties from their\nspectral energy distributions. The results show discs over a range of sizes,\ntypically 1-10 times the diameter of the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt in our Solar\nSystem. The mass of a disc, for particles up to a few millimetres in size, is\nuniquely obtainable with submillimetre observations and this quantity is\npresented as a function of the host stars' age, showing a tentative decline in\nmass with age. Having doubled the number of imaged discs at submillimetre\nwavelengths from ground-based, single dish telescope observations, one of the\nkey legacy products from the SONS survey is to provide a comprehensive target\nlist to observe at high angular resolution using submillimetre/millimetre\ninterferometers (e.g., ALMA, SMA).\n", "  The ground-state properties of 64Ge, 68Se, 72Kr and 76Sr (N=Z) nuclei have\nbeen investigated by using Hartree-Fock-Bogolibov (HFB)method with Sly4 Skyrme\nforces and Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with NL3 and recently proposed\nDEFNE interaction parameters sets. For determination of ground-state axially\ndeformed shape and quadrupole moment constrained calculations have been\nemployed in RMF model. The results of the present study have been compared with\neach other and available experimental data in the literature. The ground-state\nbinding energies,neutron, proton and charge radii, quadrupole moment\ndeformation parameters of these nuclei have been calculated. Furthermore,\nneutron skin thickness of considered nuclei as a function of deformation\nparameter have been obtained and discussed in detail.\n", "  In this paper, by utilizing the idea of stabilizer codes, we give some\nrelationships between one local unitary representation of braid group in\nN-qubit tensor space and the corresponding entanglement properties of the\nN-qubit pure state $|\\Psi\\rangle$, where the N-qubit state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ is\nobtained by applying the braiding operation on the natural basis. Specifically,\nwe show that the separability of $|\\Psi\\rangle=\\mathcal{B}|0\\rangle^{\\otimes\nN}$ is closely related to the diagrammatic version of the braid operator\n$\\mathcal{B}$. This may provide us more insights about the topological\nentanglement and quantum entanglement.\n", "  We report observations of color in the inner coma of Comet C/2013 UQ4\n(Catalina) with the broadband B and R filters. We find significant temporal\nvariations of the color slope, ranging from -12.67 $\\pm$ 8.16 \\% per 0.1~$\\mu$m\nup to $35.09 \\pm 11.7$ \\% per 0.1~$\\mu$m.It is significant that the comet\nchanges color from red to blue over only a two-day period. Such dispersion\ncannot be characterized with an average color slope. We also observe Comet\nC/2013 UQ4 (Catalina) in infrared using Spitzer and find no significant\nCO/CO$_{2}$ gaseous species in its coma. Therefore, we classify Comet C/2013\nUQ4 (Catalina) as a dust-rich comet and attribute the measured color slope to\nits dust. We analyze the color slope using the model of agglomerated debris\nparticles and conclude that the C/2013 UQ4 coma was chemically heterogeneous,\nconsisting of at least two components. The first component producing the bluest\ncolor is consistent with Mg-rich silicates. There are three different options\nfor the second component producing the reddest color. This color is consistent\nwith either Mg-Fe silicates, kerogen type II, or organic matter processed with\na low dose of UV radiation.\n", "  Nucleon-nucleon potential is given in coordinate space starting from the\nBethe-Salpeter equation appropriate to elastic scattering at the intermediate\nenergy region. The next order in the potential is added to construct the\nscattering wave for ${}^3S_1$ state. The constant terms have an effect on the\nspin observables particularly at the center of mass angle $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$\n", "  We present new constraints on Lorentz symmetry (LS) violations with lunar\nlaser ranging (LLR). Those constraints are derived in the standard-model\nextension (SME) framework aiming at parameterizing any LS deviations in all\nsectors of physics. We restrict ourself to two sectors namely the pure\ngravitational sector of the minimal SME and the gravity-matter coupling. We\ndescribe the adopted method and compare our results to previous analysis based\non theoretical grounds. This work constitutes the first direct experimental\ndetermination of the SME coefficients using LLR measurements.\n", "  The potential due to a system of three static quark (3Q) is studied using\nSU(3) lattice QCD at finite temperature with Polyakov loops operators. We\nfocused our analysis on the large distance properties of the 3Q potential and\nfound a good fit behavior to the Y-string model formula. In addition to the\nlinearly confining term proportional to the minimal length of the Y-string, we\nobserved that the subleading logarithmic term, which is proportional to\nDedekind eta function and accounts for the Y-string's quantum fluctuations, is\nnecessary to reproduce the quark anti-quark string tension of the corresponding\nmesonic system at finite temperature.\n", "  Concepts of high precision studies of the one-way speed of light anisotropy\nare discussed. The high energy particle beam allows measurement of a one-way\nspeed of light anisotropy (SOLA) via analysis of the beam momentum variation\nwith sidereal phase without the use of synchronized clocks. High precision beam\nposition monitors could provide accurate monitoring of the beam orbit and\ndetermination of the particle beam momentum with relative accuracy on the level\nof $10^{-10}$, which corresponds to a limit on SOLA of $10^{-18}$ with existing\nstorage rings. A few additional versions of the experiment are also presented.\n", "  In this paper, we study Prandtl's boundary layer asymptotic expansion for\nincompressible fluids on the half-space in the inviscid limit. In \\cite{Gr1},\nE. Grenier proved that Prandtl's Ansatz is false for data with Sobolev\nregularity near Rayleigh's unstable shear flows. In this paper, we show that\nthis Ansatz is also false for Rayleigh's stable shear flows. Namely we\nconstruct unstable solutions near arbitrary stable monotonic boundary layer\nprofiles. Such shear flows are stable for Euler equations, but not for\nNavier-Stokes equations: adding a small viscosity destabilizes the flow.\n", "  A significant number of the parameters of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and its\nhost galaxy are calculated from the afterglow. There are various methods\nobtaining extinction values for the necessary correction for galactic\nforeground. These are: galaxy counts, from HI 21 cm surveys, from spectroscopic\nmeasurements and colors of nearby Galactic stars, or using extinction maps\ncalculated from infrared surveys towards the GRB. We demonstrate that AKARI\nFar-Infrared Surveyor sky surface brightness maps are useful uncovering the\nfine structure of the galactic foreground of GRBs. Galactic cirrus structures\nof a number of GRBs are calculated with a 2 arcminute resolution, and the\nresults are compared to that of other methods.\n", "  Molecular alignment underpins optical, mechanical, and thermal properties of\nmaterials, however, its direct measurement from volumes with micrometer\ndimensions is not accessible, especially, for structurally complex\nbio-materials. How the molecular alignment is linked to extraordinary\nproperties of silk and its amorphous-crystalline composition has to be accessed\nby a direct measurement from a single silk fiber. Here, we show orientation\nmapping of the internal silk fiber structure via polarisation-dependent IR\nabsorbance at high spatial resolution of 4.2 micrometers and 1.9 micrometers in\na hyper-spectral IR imaging by attenuated total reflection using synchrotron\nradiation in the spectral fingerprint region around 6 micrometers wavelength.\nFree-standing longitudinal micro-slices of silk fibers, thinner than the fiber\ncross section, were prepared by microtome for the four polarisation method to\ndirectly measure the orientational sensitivity of absorbance in the molecular\nfingerprint spectral window of the amide bands of b-sheets and amorphous\npolypeptides of silk. Flat lateral micro-slices of silk eliminates shape\nrelated artefact in determination of absorbance anisotropy and order parameters\nof the amide bands.\n", "  Generally, in case of the collective Jahn-Teller effect, a high-symmetry\nstructure of a matrix in which quantum systems with degenerate ground state are\ninserted becomes distorted. This usually smooth transition can become abrupt\nonly if the matrix by itself is a trigger and JTE merely activates its\nswitching. It is shown in this paper that proper insertion into matrix of\nquantum systems with the singlet ground state and degenerate excited state\nleads to the formation of a new metastable state of the whole system and a\nstepwise appearance of JTE. A matrix of any nature can be transformed into\ntrigger in this way if one manages to synthesize and insert into it proper\nquantum active centers with appropriate energy spectrum. Theoretically, this\nprovides advanced possibilities for metamaterials development.\n", "  We study a model with $U(1)$ gauged lepton number symmetry in which the\nactive neutrino masses are generated at two-loop level through the spontaneous\nbreaking of the lepton number symmetry. To cancel gauge anomalies some exotic\nleptons are introduced that also play an important role in generating neutrino\nmasses and the lightest neutral one can be a dark matter candidate. We discuss\na phenomenology of the neutral fermion sector including dark matter, lepton\nflavor violations, and an extra neutral gauge boson $Z'$ that can be tested by\n$e^+ e^-$ collision at the International Linear Collider (ILC).\n", "  The N = 2, 4 superconformal symmetry constraints in d = 4 for four point\nfunctions of chiral primary 1/2-BPS operators are derived. The operators are\ndescribed by symmetric traceless tensors of the internal R-symmetry group. A\nsubstantial simplification is achieved by introduction of null vectors. Two\nvariable polynomials corresponding to different R-symmetry representations are\nconstructed. The Ward identities for superconformal symmetry are obtained as\nsimple differential equations. The general solution is presented in terms of a\nconstant, a single variable function and a two variable function. An\ninterpretation in terms of the operator product expansion is given for the case\nof fields of equal dimension and for the so called (next-to)extremal cases. The\nresult is shown to accommodate long multiplets, semishort and short multiplets\nwith protected dimension. Generically also non-unitary multiplets can appear.\nIt is shown how to remove them to obtain a unitary theory. Implications of\ncrossing symmetry for the four point functions studied are derived and\ndiscussed. It is shown that crossing symmetry fixes the single variable\nfunction in the general solution to be of free field form using singularity\narguments. For a restricted set of next-to-extremal correlation functions with\nS3 symmetry amongst the first three fields it is shown that the amplitude is\nfixed up to normalization to free field form. We compute the conformal partial\nwave expansion of all representations in this amplitude and compute an averaged\nvalue of the anomalous dimensions for long multiplets given spin and twist in\neach relevant representation at first order in 1/N. Finally assuming the\nuniversal singularity structure we derive the general large N amplitude of four\nidentical 1/2-BPS operators in the [0, p, 0] representation in terms of D\nfunctions. Explicit expressions for all coefficients are given.\n", "  Coded aperture imaging transcends planar imaging with conventional\ncollimators in efficiency and Field of View (FoV). We present experimental\nresults for the detection of 141keV and 122keV {\\gamma}-photons emitted by\nuniformly extended 99mTc and 57Co hot-spots along with simulations of uniformly\nand normally extended 99mTc hot-spots. These results prove that the method can\nbe used for intra-operative imaging of radio-traced sentinel nodes and thyroid\nremnants. The study is performed using a setup of two gamma cameras, each\nconsisting of a coded-aperture (or mask) of Modified Uniformly Redundant Array\n(MURA) of rank 19 positioned on top of a CdTe detector. The detector pixel\npitch is 350 {\\mu}m and its active area is 4.4x4.4 cm2, while the mask element\nsize is 1.7mm. The detectable photon energy ranges from 15 keV up to 200 keV\nwith an energy resolution of 3-4 keV FWHM. Triangulation is exploited to\nestimate the 3D spatial coordinates of the radioactive spots within the system\nFoV. Two extended sources, with uniform distributed activity (11 and 24 mm in\ndiameter, respectively), positioned at 16cm from the system and with 3cm\ndistance between their centers, can be resolved and localized with accuracy\nbetter than 5%. The results indicate that the estimated positions of spatially\nextended sources lay within their volume size and that neighboring sources,\neven with a low level of radioactivity, such as 30 MBq, can be clearly\ndistinguished with counting time about 3 seconds\n", "  We study the early-time behavior of isotropic and homogeneous solutions in\nvacuum as well as radiation-filled cosmological models in the full, effective,\nfour dimensional gravity theory with higher derivatives. We use asymptotic\nmethods to analyze all possible ways of approach to the initial singularity of\nsuch universes. In order to do so, we construct autonomous dynamical systems\nthat describe the evolution of these models, and decompose the associated\nvector fields. We prove that, at early times, all flat vacua as well as general\ncurved ones are globally attracted by the \"universal\" square root scaling\nsolution. Open vacua, on the other hand show in both, future and past\ndirections a dominant asymptotic approach to horizon-free, Milne states that\nemerge from initial data sets of smaller dimension. Closed universes exhibit\nmore complex logarithmic singularities. Our results on asymptotic stability\nshow a possible relation to cyclic and ekpyrotic cosmologies at the passage\nthrough the singularity. In the case of radiation-filled universes of the same\nclass we show the essential uniqueness and stability of the resulting\nasymptotic scheme, once more dominated by $t^{1/2}$, in all cases except\nperhaps that of the conformally invariant Bach-Weyl gravity. In all cases, we\nconstruct a formal series representation valid near the initial singularity of\nthe general solution of these models and prove that curvature as well as\nradiation play a subdominant role in the dominating form. A discussion is also\nmade on the implications of these results for the generic initial state of the\ntheory.\n", "  Let $(M,g)$ be a compact manifold and let $-\\Delta \\phi_k = \\lambda_k \\phi_k$\nbe the sequence of Laplacian eigenfunctions. We present a curious new\nphenomenon which, so far, we only managed to understand in a few highly\nspecialized cases: the family of functions $f_N:M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq\n0}$ $$ f_N(x) = \\sum_{k \\leq N}{ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_k}}\n\\frac{|\\phi_k(x)|}{\\|\\phi_k\\|_{L^{\\infty}(M)}}}$$ seems strangely suited for\nthe detection of anomalous points on the manifold. It may be heuristically\ninterpreted as the sum over distances to the nearest nodal line and potentially\nhints at a new phenomenon in spectral geometry. We give rigorous statements on\nthe unit square $[0,1]^2$ (where minima localize in $\\mathbb{Q}^2$) and on\nPaley graphs (where $f_N$ recovers the geometry of quadratic residues of the\nunderlying finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$). Numerical examples show that the\nphenomenon seems to arise on fairly generic manifolds.\n", "  Evaporating liquid droplets are omnipresent in nature and technology, such as\nin inkjet printing, coating, deposition of materials, medical diagnostics,\nagriculture, food industry, cosmetics, or spills of liquids. While the\nevaporation of pure liquids, liquids with dispersed particles, or even liquid\nmixtures has intensively been studied over the last two decades, the\nevaporation of ternary mixtures of liquids with different volatilities and\nmutual solubilities has not yet been explored. Here we show that the\nevaporation of such ternary mixtures can trigger a phase transition and the\nnucleation of microdroplets of one of the components of the mixture. As model\nsystem we pick a sessile Ouzo droplet (as known from daily life - a transparent\nmixture of water, ethanol, and anise oil) and reveal and theoretically explain\nits four life phases: In phase I, the spherical cap-shaped droplet remains\ntransparent, while the more volatile ethanol is evaporating, preferentially at\nthe rim of the drop due to the singularity there. This leads to a local ethanol\nconcentration reduction and correspondingly to oil droplet nucleation there.\nThis is the beginning of phase II, in which oil microdroplets quickly nucleate\nin the whole drop, leading to its milky color which typifies the so-called\n'Ouzo-effect'. Once all ethanol has evaporated, the drop, which now has a\ncharacteristic non-spherical-cap shape, has become clear again, with a water\ndrop sitting on an oil-ring (phase III), finalizing the phase inversion.\nFinally, in phase IV, also all water has evaporated, leaving behind a tiny\nspherical cap-shaped oil drop.\n", "  By combining two different techniques to construct multi-soliton solutions of\nthe (3+1)-dimensional Skyrme model, the generalized hedgehog and the rational\nmap ansatz, we find multi-Skyrmion configurations in $AdS_{2}\\times S_{2}$. We\nconstruct Skyrmionic multi-layered configurations such that the total Baryon\ncharge is the product of the number of kinks along the radial $AdS_{2}$\ndirection and the degree of the rational map. We show that, for fixed total\nBaryon charge, as one increases the charge density on $\\partial\\left(\nAdS_{2}\\times S_{2}\\right) $, it becomes increasingly convenient energetically\nto have configurations with more peaks in the radial $AdS_{2}$ direction but a\nlower degree of the rational map. This has a direct relation with the so-called\nholographic popcorn transitions in which, when the charge density is high,\nmulti-layered configurations with low charge on each layer are favored over\nconfigurations with few layers but with higher charge on each layer. The case\nin which the geometry is $M_{2}\\times S_{2}$ can also be analyzed.\n", "  The electronic and energetic properties of the elementary building block,\ni.e. a five-membered atom ring (pentagon), of the Ge(110) surface was studied\nby scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at room temperature. The\nGe(110) surface is composed of three types of domains: two ordered domains\n((16x2) and c(8x10)) and a disordered domain. The elementary building block of\nall three domains is a pentagon. Scanning tunneling spectra recorded on the\n(16x2), c(8x10) and disordered domains are very similar and reveal three\nwell-defined electronic states. Two electronic states are located 1.1 eV and\n0.3 eV below the Fermi level respectively, whereas the third electronic state\nis located 0.4 eV above the Fermi level. The electronic states at -0.3 eV and\n0.4 eV can be ascribed to the pentagons, whilst we tentatively assigned the\nelectronic state at -1.1 eV to a Ge-Ge back bond or trough state. In addition,\nwe have analyzed the straight [1-12] oriented step edges. From the kink density\nand kink-kink distance distributions we extracted the nearest neighbor\ninteraction energy between the pentagons, which exhibit a strong preference to\noccur in twins, as well as the strain relaxation energy along the pentagon-twin\nchains.\n", "  We present here a set of examples, classes and tools which can be used for\nstatistical analysis in Graphics Processing Units (GPU). This includes binned\nand unbinned maximum likelihood fits, pseudo-experiment generation,\nconvolutions, Markov Chain Monte Carlo method implementations, and limit\nsetting techniques.\n", "  Radiation detection in applications ranging from high energy physics to\nmedical imaging rely on solid state detectors, often hybrid pixel detectors\nwith (1) reverse biased p-n junction pixel sensors and (2) readout ASICs,\nattached by flip-chip-bonding. Transient signals characteristics are important\nin, e.g., matching ASIC and sensor design, modeling and optimizing detector\nparameters and describing timing and charge sharing properties. Currently\nanalytical forms of transient signals are available for only a few limited\ncases (e.g., drift or diffusion) or for the steady state (which is not relevant\nfor high energy radiation detection). Tools are available for (relatively slow)\nnumerical evaluation of the transient charge transport. We present here the\nfirst analytical solutions of partial differential equations describing\ndrift-diffusion-recombination charge transport in planar p-n junction sensors\nin a variety of conditions: (1) undepleted, (2) fully depleted, (3) taking into\naccount the gradual velocity saturation, and (4) overdepleted. We deduce the\nGreen's functions which can be applied to any detection problem through simple\nconvolution with the initial conditions. We compare the analytical solutions\nwith Monte Carlo simulations and industry standard simulations (Synopsys\nSentaurus), demonstrating good agreement. Using the analytical equations\nenables fast modeling of the influence of various detector parameters on\ntracking, imaging and timing performance, describing performance and enabling\noptimizations for different applications. Finally, we illustrate this model\nwith applications in 3D+T (x,y,z,time) photon tracking and 4D+T\n(x,y,theta,phi,time) relativistic charged particle tracking.\n", "  The discovery of topological phases introduces new perspectives and platforms\nfor various interesting physics originally investigated in quantum context and\nthen, on an equal footing, in classic wave systems, such as photonics,\nacoustics and mechanics. As a characteristic feature, nontrivial Fermi arcs,\nconnecting between topologically distinct Fermi surfaces, play vital roles in\nthe clarification of Dirac and Weyl semimetals and have been observed in\nquantum materials very recently. However, in classical systems, no direct\nexperimental observation of Fermi arcs in the momentum space has been reported\nso far. Here, using near-field scanning measurements, we show the observation\nof a photonic Fermi arcs connecting topologically distinct bulk states in\nchiral hyperbolic metamaterials. To verify the topological nature of this\nsystem, we further observe backscattering-immune propagation of nontrivial\nsurface wave across a three-dimension physical step. Our results demonstrate\nmetamaterial approach towards topological photonics and offer a deeper\nunderstanding of topological phases in three-dimension classical systems.\n", "  Concurrence, introduced by Hill and Wootters [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 5022\n(1997)], provides an important measure of entanglement for a general pair of\nqubits that is strictly positive for entangled states and vanishing for all\nseparable states. We present an extension of concurrence to general continuous\nvariable pure states of multiple degrees of freedom by generalizing the\nLagrange's identity and wedge product framework proposed by Bhaskara et al.\n[Quantum Inf. Process. 16, 118 (2017)] for pure discrete variable systems in\narbitrary dimensions. A family of faithful entanglement measures, of which\nconcurrence is a member, is constructed that admit necessary and sufficient\nconditions for separability across arbitrary bipartitions, which is shown as a\nparticular invariance with connections to the partial transpose, uncovering an\ninherent geometry of entanglement. This framework may be useful for the further\nextensions to mixed states and entanglement in quantum field theories.\n", "  In studying the avalanches and noise in a model of hysteresis loops we have\ndeveloped two relatively straightforward algorithms which have allowed us to\nstudy large systems efficiently. Our model is the random-field Ising model at\nzero temperature, with deterministic albeit random dynamics. The first\nalgorithm, implemented using sorted lists, scales in computer time as O(N log\nN), and asymptotically uses N (sizeof(double)+ sizeof(int)) bits of memory. The\nsecond algorithm, which never generates the random fields, scales in time as\nO(N \\log N) and asymptotically needs storage of only one bit per spin, about 96\ntimes less memory than the first algorithm. We present results for system sizes\nof up to a billion spins, which can be run on a workstation with 128MB of RAM\nin a few hours. We also show that important physical questions were resolved\nonly with the largest of these simulations.\n", "  In this paper we present an axiomatic, geometric, formulation of\nelectromagnetism with only one axiom: the field equation for the Faraday\nbivector field F. This formulation with F field is a self-contained, complete\nand consistent formulation that dispenses with either electric and magnetic\nfields or the electromagnetic potentials. All physical quantities are defined\nwithout reference frames, the absolute quantities, i.e., they are geometric\nfour dimensional (4D) quantities or, when some basis is introduced, every\nquantity is represented as a 4D coordinate-based geometric quantity comprising\nboth components and a basis. The new observer independent expressions for the\nstress-energy vector T(n)(1-vector), the energy density U (scalar), the\nPoynting vector S and the momentum density g (1-vectors), the angular momentum\ndensity M (bivector) and the Lorentz force K (1-vector) are directly derived\nfrom the field equation for F. The local conservation laws are also directly\nderived from that field equation. The 1-vector Lagrangian with the F field as a\n4D absolute quantity is presented; the interaction term is written in terms of\nF and not, as usual, in terms of A. It is shown that this geometric formulation\nis in a full agreement with the Trouton-Noble experiment.\n"]}
